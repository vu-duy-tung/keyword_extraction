We walked in and were seated right away but sat for quite some time before ordering. The waitress brought our drinks and then disappeared until our food came out. We ordered the chicken club and an order of potato skins.   The potato skins were done well and came with all the necessary fixins.. Cheese, bacon, scallions and a sour cream like sauce.   The Chicken Club was perfect, Lightly toasted Garlic Sourdough with chicken breast, bacon, avocado, tomato and lettuce.   I really feel bad about this review only being 3 stars because the food was great as usual but the service was far less then lacking.. My water went empty and stayed empty throughout the entire meal, and we had to wait for quite some time for our check to come. With a small meal at BJ's taking an hour and a half I would say there was some sort of hang up or issue with the service.",

Some updated reasons why I love this place: *Happy Hour pricing during all football games *They make a light (135 calorie/pint) beer in house that doesn't suck *Ahi Tuna poke. No it's not as good as Poke express, but this is a bar and it's $5.55 during HH and is served with lots of beautiful green avocado ! Shockingly fresh and tasty for a chain. *They now offer brunch! They open at 10 AM for the early games and have a lengthy brunch menu including breakfast pizza and captain crunch french toast .  *Great football viewing in the bar area. 6 games on at once, perfect visibility, HUGE screen. PT's can't touch this place for football watching. *No gaming, no smoking *Huge menu   Sadly, it's just a corporate chain, but they are consistent, cheap, and great for football watching. Hard to beat that combination !",

    "text": "They really do try hard at BJ's and I feel like they get that extra star for effort.  When it comes to family friendly chain restaurants, BJs is one of the few that I like. Their food, while not of remarkable. is consistent and some dishes don't substitute in fat to make up for flavor. BJ's has been able to really define itself in what is a competitive market segment. Having it's own selection of micro-brewed beers, deep-dish pizzas, and of-course the pazookie set it apart from the likes of Claim Jumper and others.   I usually end up coming here almost once a week. The sandwiches and the deep-dish pizza (the Great White and the Mediterranean are awesome) never fail. But what really brings me in is of course the pazookie. It's their signature dessert, just like the cheesecakes at the cheesecake factory.   Service is often hit or miss, but unfortunately my last experience was a miss. I came in during happy hour with a couple friends to catch the game. The bar area was pretty barren, no wait at all. We got our seat an the server took our order. Unlike most happy hour patrons, our group ordered pretty much everything. Beers, appetizers, pizza, pazookies, everything. The food was good, but for whatever reason, our server kept rushing. Maybe she was about to get off and wanted this the tip before she clocked out, I don't know. But considering the place was totally empty, I don't get why they would want to turn this table over so fast. Feeling rushed really does ruin the dining experience, especially at a place I go to so often. She brought our check out before the pazookie arrived which is highly unusual. After dessert had arrived the server stopped by to see if we had paid, seeing we that we had not, she stood nearby waiting for us to do so. This made the whole dining experience really AWKWARD.  I don't really expect every experience here to be like this, but it was really uncomfortable.",

However, the manager was super nice, and because he realized how difficult waiting for food with hungry kids can be, comped our entire meal, drinks, dessert and all.

It's a fast fix to mediocre food at cheap corporate prices  when you have a busy business schedule like myself-a step above Burger King, McDonalds and other fast food chains.  Basically this is corporate America - hiring idiots who can't deliver simple requests like a decent salad that doesn't look like a small Hamster portion with shredded and soggy lettuce and chopped tomato!  Looks like one of those prepackaged salads at McDonalds.  Sorry, I requested actual sliced tomato, avocado and red onion and real lettuce but the dumb server screwed it up.  Let alone I order a charbroiled steak (not fried) and they only charbroiled one side with that facing up (as if I would'nt notice).  When I sent back the salad without eating it this manager - a little \"piss ant\" bald jerk comes running out and tells me to leave the restaurant and not come back!  About a month before that the lot was entirely full without one space so I parked my car in the take out area and this little creep Morrison comes running up to the bar threatening to tow me!  When I complained to Corporate Management they actually defended him!  It must be difficult to find decent employees with the crappy wages they pay.  So much for getting repeat business - they could care less.  Better to hire twenty bad employees and pay them crap than hire five good ones and pay them fairly.  That's why their turnover is so high.  Steer clear of this place is my advice.",

    "text": "So I decided to come here with some friends to celebrate my birthday. I wish I would have gotten the name of our waiter but it seems like this location has had it's share of bad service anyways, Which is really sad due to how satisfied I was with the portions and flavor of the food. Everything was cooked to perfection and not to mention the amazing variety of foods and drinks. Anyways on to the main point: Our waiter was just...weird in the way of how he talked to us and did everything. Its almost as if he felt uncomfortable serving us as he didnt want to look us in the eye and did everything half-assed and handled everything passive-aggressively. I understand that being a waiter is hard especually attending to many people however this particular night was not busy at all.  It was my 21st birthday so my friend wanted to buy me a drink, & obviously we had to show I.D., I knew it was a long shot since I had just gotten my I.D. renewed (i brought the old one and a new temporary one). With that I was declined my drink, which was no big deal, untill it came time to ask the waiter if they did anything for birthdays. In a very mocking and sarcastic tone he said \"Point and laugh at you.\". After 15 min he brought out a cookie with ice cream and a candle on top and just handed it to me...no \"Happy Birthday\" or anything else that other places do for your birthday.  I'm not asking for a parade, rather a little enthusiasm.  This experience left a bad taste and honestly I'm very dissapointed.  It's not that hard to engage your customers and to be nice, like really, it won't kill you I promise!",

The avocado egg rolls weren't my cup of tea, but the Bacon Cheeseburger Pizza was terrific.  Not what I usually want when I am in the mood for pizza, but I was impressed by the meaty chunks of ground beef and the sauce that is drizzled over the deep dish pie.  But enough about the food. I came here for the beer.  My first time I tried their 7-beer flight.  The Porter and the Tatonka Stout were a little heavy for me, but the red and brown ales were right up my alley.  Some of their brews are STRONG in the alcohol department.  I'll just leave it at that.  What I was most surprised by was the selection of other beers on tap.  Most brewpub-type places only serve their own concoctions, but this place offers options from a wide variety of American microbreweries and foreign brewers.  The selection of tap beers that aren't made on the premises is impressive enough that I would likely want to return to BJ's even if they didn't make their own delicious booze.",

For the main course my friend had the small barbecue pizza, and I ordered the California sandwich (think thats what it was called). Anyways the pizza was kinda deep dish style and cooked perfectly. The sandwich consist of grilled chicken, avocado, chipotle sauce, mayo, and peppers on garlic bread, and it was fantastic.   We were stuffed, big portions, and top notch customer service, I couldn't walk by one employee without them greeting me. I will come back here again and again.  Oh and are bill with generous tip came to $40",

    "text": "I want to like this place more...I really do.  Unfortunately, the execution just isn't there. BJ's has an excellent variety of food and beverages.  The food ranges from average to good, with everything leaning on the expensive side.  If I were to review based solely on food and beverage, they would probably get a 3.5- to 4-star rating.   The problem starts and stops with the service.  I understand the place is popular, busy during non-peak times and a downright unbearable wait during prime time, but the fact that they have such a constant stream of patrons makes the lack of execution in the kitchen even more unfathomable.  I am yet to have a meal here with over two entrees ordered where all the entrees came out at the same time.  I have waited as long as fifteen minutes between the first entree and last entree being served.  To me, that's unacceptable.  In addition, the wait staff seems to be rather hit or miss as to their general level of competency.  Nonetheless, I'm sure that I'll continue to wind up here every month or two. Sigh.",

    "text": "I went to BJ's on Friday with my husband to celebrate our anniversary. We wanted a casual dinner and this place was ok for that. It was loud and really busy, but we were seated within 15 minutes. Our serve was nice, but you could tell she was a bit overwhelmed as there was a large party next to us.  To get drink refills, I had to push my empty glass towards the end of the table, etc I got a tropical tea to drink, which was nice as it wasn't sugar sweetened, the only downside is they brewed it very weak.  My husband had a steak and a HUGE baked potato. He said it was pretty good. I had the French dip with fries. It was ok, but I requested the thin fries as you have a choice of thin or seasoned. I think that was a mistake, they were on the plate, under the sandwich and were pretty limp and greasy. I asked for Ranch to eat them with but the ranch was just eh as well. The sandwich itself was pretty good. For dessert I really wanted a pzookie, but didn't want a large one, so my serve requested a mini one, for 3.00 it was quite large actually and pretty good! The woman next to us got nachos and they looked huge and good! So that might be an item to try in the future. All in all, it was alright. The bill was a little over 50 dollars w/ tip and I thought that was a bit high as there was no alcohol in the tab, but hubby ordered a steak, so not totally out of line.",

    "text": "This morning we had intended to go to Vintner Grill for brunch, however, their website hadn't been updated showing their reduced hours so we ended up going to BJ's Brew House nearby. Although we prefer to patronize independent restaurants since chains aren't usually too exciting, we find you can get decent food at reasonable prices and the food is always consistent. Obviously everyone else must feel the same because you don't see too many of them closing once they've opened, and well, just look at every street corner in urban areas.  I ordered the \"French Toast Combo\" ($7.95) but subbed the adult french toast for the children's Cap'n Crunch coated and fried french toast. I don't know why you'd order sugar-coated and deep fried food for your child but it sounded pretty good so I though I'd give it a whirl. The eggs came out nice and hot and the apple-smoked bacon was of decent quality, but not crispy enough for my taste. The french toast was especially crispy but did not fall into the category of \"lightly fried\" as the description on the menu suggested. At first I thought it was alright but then I pressed down with my fork and saw oil starting to pool. Yuck. I reluctantly cut into the other piece which was astonishingly better. The Cap'n Crunch taste was nowhere to be found but it was much lighter and a fun version of french toast. Ian had the grilled chicken and cheese stuffed baked potato ($8.95). The Alfredo sauce that accompanied it tasted like it was straight out of a bag of Bertolli's frozen pasta (really bad) and the potato was unexciting. It was definitely a GMO potato if I'd ever seen one. What is America coming to...",

    "text": "Well, the place has been open for nearly 2 years now and we've never tried it so we thought we would give it a go. The parking lot is usually full so it had me thinking they are doing something right.  Anyways we get seated and take a look at the menu, we selected our choices and drinks. We were asked, \"WOULD YOU LIKE SOME CHIPS & SALSA?\" well like at most Mexican restaurants that is the way dinner usually starts (yes, I realize this isn't a Mexican restaurant), so we said sure. Jumping ahead to get the message across to you, I get home and take a look at the receipt, well what do you know?! $5.50 charge on the check for Chips & Salsa. What really got me was that wasn't suggested as an appetizer, it was suggested as if was \"Would you like a glass of water?\" They didn't say, \"Would you like to start off with some potato skins or blah blah blah..\" Get my point? Well I called the manager on the phone about this and during one point of my complaint, she actually giggled at me!! She tried to make good and asked who my server was, but I said that I didn't blame the server I blame management for trying to \"up sell\" in a round about way. The \"manager\" then tried to make good and take if off my bill, I just said, \"I don't care about the $5.50, I am concerned about the way it got on to my bill in the first place\". What a unprofessional way to respond to a customer concern!  Pros: Food wasn't horrible, but nothing outstanding about it.  Cons: My 1/2 pound burger was kind of skimpy and makes me wonder what weighs 1/2 pounds? The entire burger weight? Also my burger patty  was crumbly and was in 3 sections, all holding together for the most part but in sections. The french fries? I really dislike this micro threads of shoestring potatos.   Wife had Fettucini Alfredo with chicken. The chicken breast was sliced thin and was very very tiny, looked like 1/3 of a breast cut up as a garnish. The pasta was good, but the noodles had  what seemed to be heat lamp dryness to it. It was probably sitting and waiting to be presented together with my cooking hamburger. The Alfredo sauce was so thin it looked like it was non existent, but if you mix it up the sauce comes back up to the top and is present again.  Overall we won't be coming back and really do not know what all the commotion is all about. My local neighborhood bars like Timbers or PTs can do better.",

We were seated within 5 minutes after arriving.  We ordered Avocado Eggs Rolls and Thai Shrimp Lettuce Wraps.  I really liked the Avocado Eggs Rolls and the others loved the Thai Shrimp Lettuce Wraps.  The Entree's that were ordered were Parmesan Crusted Chicken, Fish Tacos and an Angus Burger. The Fish Taco plate came with (2) Fish Taco's.  I only ate (1) taco and I couldn't taste the fish.  My husband ate the other Taco and loved it. The Parmesan Crusted Chicken was good but could have been better if there was more of the special sauce over the whole meal instead of on just a portion of it.  The Angus Burger was a little dry and the menu said it came with Thousand Island Sauce, but that sauce was missing from the Burger.  The Pomegranate Margarita's were delicious.  I will try this restaurant one more time to check out the Pizza.  Our toal bill was $71.00.",

We found the service very good on 1st trip, and adequate on 2nd trip,but the 2nd trip was very busy for them so I assume service level is dictated by how much the staff has to handle. Wife loved the free refills of house made sodas and I ejoyed the house porter & stout. Food quality above avg for a chain and we truly enjoyed the calif chicken sandwhiches and side salad upgrade was a nice feature. Surprisingly alot around us ordered Pizza- in a town full of pizza. I should think stick to bar style foods here. I would return if I`m in the area or find a BJs elsewhere would gladly stop",

The server that helped us were super friendly and constantly checked on us. We didn't even have to ask for the refill with our drinks. We ordered the following items Appetizers: Chicken wings $11.50 - ask them to split in half buffalo and root beer glaze. Very crunchy and little oil. 4.8/5 Avocado egg rolls $11.50 - still prefer the one from Cheesecake but their tamarind sauce is good though 3.5/5 Crispy calamari $11. 50 - pretty much similar to other restaurants but not that oily. 4.2/5  Entrees: -full back pork ribs Thursday promo $17.95 it came with two items and a mini pizookie - worth getting this deal if you happen to come here on Thursday. The sauce amount of sauce was perfectly applied to the ribs and the meat was super tender 4.8/5 -seared ahi salad - $15.95 - my brother ate the meat and I ate the salad. Their rice vinaigrette sauce wasn't that sour 4.4/5 -seafood tacos $10.75 - my brother said the seafood was well marinated and he would give it 4/5 :-).  -steak top sirloin - $16.50 nothing special about this dish 3.8/5 -Shrimp & asparagus pasta - $16.95 - too salty and somehow the flavor wasn't there 3/5 - tavern cut flatbread brew house classic with pineapple - $17.25 must eat it while it still hot but very crunchy. They burned it a little though 3.5/5 - Tavern cut garlic chicken pesto $15.95 - too dry would be better if they have little bit more sauce 3.5/5 -Spaghetti with meatballs $9.99 - my daughter regret that she she ordered this dish. The dish was too dried and nothing special with the sauce. 2.5/5 I opted not to order my dish so I could try out all the dishes :-). Anyhow, I love their root beer drink.",

The restaurant is spacious with plenty of televisions so you can take a peek at your favorite game. Their menu is huge and everyone can find something to eat. But there's only a handful of items that I personally would consistently order though.  For me, of course I'm a fan of their craft beer. They have a nice selection that runs the spectrum of flavors with the Jeremiah Red and PM Porter being my favorites. You can order a flight if you're having trouble deciding or want to try multiple beers. Their deep dish pizza with the thick, crunchy, and slightly greasy crust has always been pretty consistent. The Pizookies are a must order. A warm cookie with ice cream is a slam dunk.  On our most recent visit, I decided to go with the 14 oz. ribeye ($21.50) with brussel sprouts and asparagus. I wouldn't order this again, nor would I recommend it. It wasn't terrible, but for the price, I can get a better, larger steak from the butcher. The brussel sprouts were mush and I couldn't finish them. We finished with the salted caramel pizookie which was delicious and completely annihilated.  I made the mistake this visit by going away from one of my staples, but I wouldn't think twice about coming back for drinks at the bar or bringing the group for a meal.",

    "text": "I came to BJ's for a beer tasting dinner. I like the ambiance here; clean, dimly lit, gorgeous big booths for seating and high ceilings.   I had a blast at the beer tasting and enjoyed trying a variety of IPAs! The experience was awesome... the host walked us through the history and type of each beer we tasted and we also were served a course of several small dishes. They poured generous samples of each beer and filled us back up if we requested. I was a little buzzed by the end, but that was expected, right?  I've been here a few times since then for drinks and have tried their pizzas and some appetizers. The food isn't anything to rave about and they are known for their pizzas but I've tried much better. The service is always good, can't complain there. I don't come back too often but I would definitely sign up for their next beer tasting dinner!",

If you are unfortunate enough to get the waitress Jeramie, run. Cold, uninterested, useless and doesn't care about the customer or her job.   I wrote Mr. Uphoff a detailed email detailing our experience commenting on positives and negatives. No Response. Not even an auto reply. Zip. After 4 days I forwarded it to corporate. No Response. They are disinterested.   Go elsewhere. They food is marginal, service is weak and I spent $65 for lunch for 3 people. No drinks at all. Seriously. Any place is better.",

Let me start by saying the service was amazing, but ... the fried chicken as funny as that sounds is a beef patty, but that's not the issue, my issue was the patty smelled and tasted funny. We let the waiter know and he jumped to take it out of the bill for us ... which is fine, but honestly I would have much appreciated if he had asked what the issue with it was so it doesn't happen again than just taking it of the bill. It didn't make me feel good to have him not ask what the issue was and follow up on it.  Other than that, the rest of the food and the ambiance was pretty good.",

We asked the bartender Scott at what point they stop serving him and the bartender said \"when he's drunk\" and I said \"you don't think he's drunk?\"  We got the manager involved as this guy was touching me and making a scene and i felt it was handled very poorly.  The manager just made him slide down and kept saying \"I have to slide down for the fat and ugly girl.\"  This guy was clearly over served and they let him remain at the bar and continued to make a scene.  I absolutely will not be back to this location due to the way this situation has been handled.  I am expecting a response and would look into your bartenders over serving your guests as that is definitely a liability.",

Our table ordered... Mahi Mahi tacos. You can choose between fried or grilled topped with some cabbage, pico de gallo and i think it's some kind of aioli. De-lish!  My love got fish & chips and the couscous macncheese. Fish was pretty good. Batter just a hair too much for him BUT that couscous was really good! Who would of thunk?? Couscous mac.  Garlic chicken pesto pizza. G-double O-D-GOOD!  Sisters got boneless Siracha chicken wings and a guac burger (bleh, b/c I'm *cough* allergic to avacado.   And the little cousin got a kids cheese pizza which by the way looked really good and he said, it was delicious   And for desert, pizookie of course. Peanut butter, salted caramel, chocolate chunk, monkey bread pizookie. All were delicious and only $3 on Tuesday for a normal size  As for our server, she was awesome. I feel horrible bc I don't remember her name BUT she kept our drinks filled, was knowledgeable on the menu, and  was fun!   I definitely will come back to try other dishes on the menu and will be back for $3 Tuesday pizookies.",

    "text": "BTW, for those who care, this is my 100th review!!! Woot woot!   Anyways, I Went here for dinner with some friends because one of them never had a pizookie and I just couldn't let that go on for any longer.   Nothing too special about this place, but it is known for their pizzas. I ended up ordering the chicken limon pasta which was really good, but that could be because I was super hungry at that time. The pasta was filling, but it was also really buttery and oily. I don't eat that heathy, but it'd be nice if the fatty stuff wasn't just straight up obvious because it can be off putting at times. On the bright side, the two sticks of garlic bread they gave was pretty good and was a nice compliment to the dish.  My friends and I got the strawberry beignet and the pizookie trio (white chocolate macadamia, Oreo, and chocolate chip) for dessert. The beignet was pretty crispy which is a big plus and the scoop of vanilla ice cream and strawberry pieces made it even better.   I also discovered my newfound appreciation of the Oreo pizookie. If you haven't yet, you have to try it out when you get the chance. Just be aware that the portion sizes for each of the trio is pretty small so it would be a nice small dessert for 3 people to split.   This place is a little overpriced in terms of the food and portion size, so just be aware of that.",

    "text": "great spot to come for a bite with friends with a wide range of beers and drink specials.  i've tried multiple things on the menu, but usually stick to the chicken mediterranean tacos. tried the new salmon pita tacos which were also awesome! grilled salmon with a creamy aioli, crispy green apples and a slaw with toasted, candied walnuts! pita is soft and the side quinoa/couscous is a refreshing palate cleanser between bites.   the root beer glazed chicken wings were great. right amount of crispy bite without drying out the inside and the glaze is not overly sweet. my boyfriend loved the crispy chicken salad with the honey mustard style dressing and my bestie loved the wings.   we come here once in a blue moon, but overall, for the beer selection & consistency with food quality, i would definitely recommend this spot if you want a little contemporary american cuisine variety.   service can be a hit or miss when dining, but i have noticed that the bar seating area with RACHEL is always a win. having had different servers there, i would definitely say she is the friendliest & best at her job. hard to find servers that actually care nowadays about the service quality, so if you're picky about service, find her!   definitely worth a shoutout BJ's!",

For Tuesday's, they have half off on wines and deep dish mini size pizzas.   They also have their own crafted beers that can only be found at the restaurant. They have quite a few to choose from so it is sure to find one to your liking. They also have different entrees such as burgers, pastas, and more. They have an enlightened healthy menu for those who are on the healthy side. I strongly recommend trying some of their seasonal crafted beers.  The athmosphere of place is very moderate, not too loud but not too quiet. There are televisions in about every corner for those who are here for sports. They also have an outside seating area which is perfect when the sun starts to set and the weather gets cool.  They also have a dessert menu, try the pizzookie, a fresh baked cookie topped off with ice cream, it's delicious. They have a rewards program where you can earn points and use it on future eats.   Enjoy!",

    "text": "I love coming into BJ's, and I came in tonight with my family for my birthday. I work in the restaurant industry, and I was seriously unimpressed with their service and waitstaff. We weren't greeted with a \"welcome\" or \"hello\" by the hostess up front, just her chewing gum with an open mouth. I don't think I saw her smile once. It was a busy night, I understand. But it continued with our server, Lauren. I remembered her name because I was embarrassed for her in regards to her hospitality. Not warm, not friendly, maybe spent 90 seconds total with our table the entire night. She made no effort to be warm or welcoming, and she seemed to be in such a rush that us asking for service was an inconvenience to her.  The food was good! That's what those two stars are for. However, when we ordered a dessert (we were so excited for the pizookies), there was a long black hair in one of them. Mind you, all of the women in our group are very blonde - we knew in no way could it be ours. We let Lauren know, and she took the dessert trio off our tab. She didn't apologize, she wasn't apologetic or accommodating whatsoever besides doing the bare minimum of taking the dessert off our tab.  The manager was friendly and apologetic, but the impression had been made. I work in a restaurant that gets busier than most, easily as busy as BJ's was tonight. Our waitstaff is still warm, friendly, collected, and accommodating. The lack of professionalism at this establishment was impossible to ignore, and the quality of our service had me feeling mortified on Lauren's (and that hostess's, and frankly the entire restaurant's) behalf. I truly hope Lauren was having a really, really bad night, and that she doesn't regularly give this quality of service to other customers.",

With room for dessert, we ordered the Chocolate Chip Pizookie, which is a must if you eat here!  Over a nice dinner and cool conversation, I can't think of a better place to hang after a typical Vegas night. Great drinks, even better atmosphere, and awesome server!

Given the number of us, service was decent, albeit food came slow.  Food is mediocre. My tomato soups seemed more like spaghetti sauce. My pizza was okay and I enjoyed it again for dinner. The one thing I've found with BJs to be both its advantage and downfall is its large variety of a menu. Two things I can always count on are the beer and their pizookies. Also, their raspberry lemonade was pretty good too.  My only other issue is the YELP check in coupon. The servers don't seem to know the details of this BOGO lunch. I was told I needed to sign up with their rewards program or something to get it. The fine print doesn't say anything of that sort on the coupon. Unfortunately I came into the restaurant ready to split costs with a coworker but they didn't honor it.",

    "text": "I decided to give this place a try last week and I may or may not ever go back. The food was good (I ordered my food low carb: a double cheeseburger without a bun and a side of broccoli instead of fries). The kitchen was very accommodating and didn't give me a hassle about the substitution. The burger was really good and had a nice chargrilled taste to it. My problem was with the portion size of the broccoli. I know veggies are more expensive than potatoes, but COME ON! I was served 5 little florets of broccoli; one was cut in half to try to fill the empty space more. (See the photo I uploaded). I took a picture of my plate the minute it was served to me. Was there a broccoli shortage or something? I thought that was ridiculous.   The menu isn't too varied but they seem to have lots of pizza options. The \"brewhouse\" element of the place is really played down. They have a few beer tanks in the far back corner that are hidden out of view.   The food was good, the ambiance was fine, but the service was absolutely horrendous! We weren't greeting when we walked in the place for about 10 minutes -- on a Saturday afternoon around 1:30 pm! This is a busy time and restaurants need to have on their \"game face.\" When we finally were greeting, we got a nice table but then we had to wait and wait and wait for a server to greet us. Finally, after 15 minutes, we were approached. We ordered drinks...and then had to wait and wait and wait to get them! Finally we ordered our food, which took over 30 minutes to arrive. People at adjacent tables were all complaining (loudly) about how bad the service was. Our waiter disappeared for the entire meal, and we finally had to get up to go find somebody to ask for our check. It was abysmal. There were plenty of employees around, but our waiter was HORRIBLE. I don't know if I'll ever go back because the service was just so bad.",

Our waiter who was super nice took our drink orders and we also decided to order an appetizer.  We ordered pot stickers for the appetizer.  The pot stickers were very tasty.  As for my main course, I decided to order the baby back ribs.  The ribs were very flavorful, and very meaty.  I had a baked potato (loaded) as a side which was also tasty.  My son ordered mini kids corn dogs, which he enjoyed.  My bf ordered a steak which he devoured quickly so I guess he liked it.  Than again he devours everything quickly.    Overall this place exceeded my expectations.  I would come back again.  The food was delicious, good quality, with huge portions, and our server was awesome.",

It was just a little kids starter but it was so appreciative and we've never had that given to us before. It made my daughter happy, and she devoured the fruit within a minute or two. We actually ended up ordering her an additional side because she loved it. Our food was good, but our waitress really made our experience enjoyable!

    "text": "My friend is visiting town from Germany so we decided to try this place out, my roommate is quite a fan of bj's and it was my first time. As soon as we sit down the waitress brings our menu's, and my friend promptly asks for the beer menu when the server replies with an, \"Are you even old enough?\" I didn't pick up on any sarcastic humor there, and to me that is offensive to just assume that he is not of age. It is one thing to ask for id but to blatantly state that she does not think he is of age is another. He then provides for her his german identification card which she has to go approve with the manager.   We proceed to order a bowl of soup and a few appetizers to start out with, both were very delicious. Actually one of the better bowls of clam chowder i've had in a while. We then place our order for our food I ordered a small 11\" hand tossed pizza, which i said exactly like that, my roommate orders a chicken club, and our friend orders just some shrimp tacos. 2 out of 3 of the orders come out wrong. My roommate has a very sensitive stomach and her sandwich (chicken club) some how has green chiles on it. Which is not noted on the menu so she promptly asks them to take it off. My order came out as a 9\" DEEP DISH pizza. Which was completely the wrong style of pizza i ordered. Our waitress comes out and says that \"I ordered a small and hand tossed doesn't come in small\" so she gave me a deep dish...? The hand tossed does come in an 11in size which is what I said when I ordered so I do not appreciate her trying to blame me for her mistake in the order. I told her I don't want it i'm no longer hungry at this point when she urges me to box the pizza up. The manager comes to the table, and In my experience managers are usually apologetic. However the first thing she says when she comes to our table is \"So whats the problem\". We explained our problem and she \"fixed it\" by taking our orders off the bill. Whatever. Probably won't be trying this place again anytime soon.",

The bar tender was not shy when pouring the margaritas, which made very happy. The peach margarita is seasonal and was my favorite of the two. If you're old enough, I recommend sitting at the bar - you're right in front of the TVs playing a variety if sports channels and have easy access to alcohol!",

    "text": "There is a reason this place is called BJ's. Once you've had it in your mouth, you won't want to swallow! For some unknown reason, when my coworkers want to go out for lunch, they always want BJ's. Every time we have gone there, the service was atrocious. We wait forever for our food and some of us get served 10 minutes before others. The food is mediocre and generic at best. One time I ordered baby back ribs and they were literally the worst ribs I have ever had. They were undercooked and tough (ribs should fall off of the bone) and had absolutely no flavor. There was very little barbecue sauce on them and I ended up leaving hungry. My wife ordered a pasta dish (how hard is it to ruin a pasta dish?!) and it had no flavor. She had to dump a large quantity of salt on it just to make it palatable. On top of that, the waitress was very rude and inattentive.   Another thing I hate about the place is the TVs everywhere. When I go out with friends, I want to spend time talking with them, not watching TV. TVs in restaurants are very distracting and you find yourself looking at them even if you have absolutely no interest in what is being shown (our brains are actually wired to focus attention on movement).   My advice is to avoid BJ's (at least this particular location) and go to McDonald's. At least it will be fast and you know what you are getting!",

We ordered a medium pepperoni extreme with extra sauce and received a medium- no sauce, no cheese, no pepperoni pizza. We also ordered the chicken pot sticker appetizer and did not receive it.   Approximately 15 minutes before my order was to be delivered, I tried answering ONE phone call from a Vegas phone number. When I tried to call back, I was sent through a series of message systems... none of which told me the issue. So, I assumed all was okay.  When our order was delivered, we were missing the pot stickers and the pepperoni pizza had no cheese, sauce, or PEPPERONI!   My husband and I spoke to a very rude receptionist who said they tried calling us 3 times to verify our order. My cell phone shows they attempted to call us once and hung up when I answered. She then told us we were in the wrong.  The manager, Kevin, GM Jamie and Charles told us they would re-deliver our order at OUR expense. Really?!  NONE of BJ's management seemed to accommodate some good customers! No matter how good the food, we will NOT order from them AGAIN!",

The waiting staff are always nice, cordial and a definite reversal of the trauma their receptionists inflict upon their customers. It seems this is the 4th or 5th time in the last 2 years we have gone there that something awkward occurs. We are early people, so we arrive far before the place fills up and there always has to be some sort of controlling event at the front of this place served up with an attitude. Where are the owners or Managers of this place? Why are they not watching?  Do these owners even care what the 1st impression is for their guests?  Will they even ever see this and wonder?  Update: I was impressed that as you can see below, a Manager invited me to call and perhaps listen to any deeper insight I could provide to help them, which as someone involved professionally in service, I am always happy to do. I called in today and just missed Cory. The gal that answered the phone was rather impatient with me that I suggested I leave Cory a message. She didn't inquire if another manager could help. I had thought I had called in at a time that was before the dinner hour even begins. It is common that businesses will respond positively in social media settings like this because, well they better, even if they are not always sincere beyond that. Let's see if they return my call tomorrow, Be blessed all!",

I get my burger take a bite and as I was swallowing it I immediately realized it was meat. I asked the waiter when he came back by if it was meat and he said it was a Turkey burger. HOW does veggie burger sound anything like a Turkey burger? I told him I am vegetarian and don't eat meat. His response was \"oh, I thought you said turkey\". Then he took it away. He obviously didn't put a rush on it as it took forever to receive my replacement. The people at my table had all already finished their food for a long time when my veggie burger finally came out. I find it rather uncomfortable to be the only one eating at a table. The parts that bothered me most was the unapologetic attitude that I ate an animal by his lack of attention when I ordered. I haven't ate meat in over 20 years and this made me feel sick to my stomach that I swallowed a bite of it. Secondly the waiter didn't even bother to comp my veggie burger or give me any type of discount. This was just completely lacking concern or empathy that I ate an animal because of him and the fact I had to eat way after everyone else had eaten. I'm really disappointed. I've always enjoyed BJ'S, but after this experience and lack of consideration I doubt I will want to come back here again. It's rather unfortunate.",

A client took me to eat here with her family and we were on a time crunch, but the service was fast and the food was great. This location is far from me, but if I happen to find one closer, I might try out the rest of their menu!   Sorry this one is short & sweet. :P",

Nicholas M. Was so damn attentive to us and made sure we always had our cups full and plates filled, there wasn't a second that we were not satisfied with the service here. I am in the service industry as well and I can tell you, as an assistance manager I can tell you that this guy is gold, and will move up quick. Seriously, thank you for making our night out a special one. We really, really appreciate the hospitality!",

    "text": "Let me start off by saying I have been going to BJs for years, well before I moved to Las Vegas. I recently went to this location last Tuesday with my boyfriend. We wanted to hit happy hour and watch the basketball game as well as the hockey game. We initially sat at the bar and asked the bartender if he could change one of the 2 TVs at the bar that were showing the jockey game, to the opening night of the NBA. He acted very strange and let us know the manager had told him they can't change the TVs but he would inquire about it. For about 15 minutes we sat at the bar, never once asked if you wanted food or drinks, and had to over hear the bartenders arguing back and forth about the channels of the games. The manager, not sure his name, came out and was extremely rude to the bartenders and made a comment such as \"what now? More customers complaining about the tv?\" We were sitting at the end of the bar and felt very uncomfortable and the bartender tried to whisper to him that we were sitting right there . He didn't once acknowledge us, or apologize about all the confusion or ask us if we needed something . We then see that the tv was changed at the other end of the bar, where there was no other seating- for another guest who had apparently asked for the same game. So since at this point we had been there for 20+ minutes with no service at the bar, we moved to a high top table near the tv playing the game we wanted to watch. Now I understand them wanting to play the Knights game as that is our local team- but it was playing on 6/9 TVs throughout the restaurant. We continued with the evening and tried to forget about it. I've worked in the restaurant industry before and I just really saw how unprofessional the staff was there. The manager on duty lacked customer service and leadership. The restaurant was busy during this time and I saw him one time talking to guests- which was one table and he was there for about 45 minutes - leading me to believe that he knew them. He never once came to my table to check on us or again apologize about the delay in service, or acknowledge how inappropriately he acted in front of us as guests. Our server, an older woman, was very attentive and made sure we enjoyed the rest of our time there.  We live down the street and frequently go to this location. Though I can't say I'll never be back, I'm very disappointed with the lack of service the management and bartenders offered. I would not recommended going to this location if there is another that is not too far out of your way.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I just went here today for the first time. We started off ordering drinks and appetizers. I had an Alabama Sunset and my boyfriend had a Jeremiah Red beer. They were both delicious! For appetizers I ordered us the crisp potato skins and he ordered the deep fried artichoke hearts for himself. Both appetizers were amazing. The potato skins had a wonderful crisp and tasted incredible with their ranch dip or sour cream. My boyfriend also thoroughly enjoyed his artichokes! They had a very nice texture, and tasted great!   Since we hadn't been there before, our waiter offered my boyfriend a beer sampling. My boyfriend says all of their beers that he tried were fantastic, but the Jeremiah Red was his favorite.  For our entrees I had the chicken fettuccine alfredo and my boyfriend ordered the country fried steak burger. Both meals were delicious, although I could have used a tad more broccoli in my pasta.  Our waiter had told us about an offer on the restaurant's app where you can get a free pizookie when you create an account. My boyfriend and I both signed up, and each got a free dessert! The pizookies are so delicious and warm and taste amazing with the ice cream melting on them. I ordered the double chocolate (which also has chocolate ice cream, so more like triple chocolate) and I could not have been more satisfied. Tasted great with my Alabama Sunset as well! My boyfriend ordered the white chocolate macadamia nut pizookie and he loved it. He says it was the perfect dessert to go with dinner.  Overall the atmosphere was very nice. The lighting was perfect, and it wasn't loud despite the dining area being pretty full.   Our waiter's name was Darin. He was SO SWEET and attentive! He made us feel very comfortable and we appreciated his opinions and suggestions very much, as we were new to the restaurant. He came around the perfect amount and was very caring and attentive to us, but not overly so. He was a real pleasure.   Would totally recommend overall, and we will be returning!",

I ordered a rib eye steak medium rare it came out completely rare and extremely bland, as well as the potatoes were bland. The other order was the pacific ahi soba noodles and there was soooooo much wasabi in it that it was absolutely disgusting and I've had this order many times while pleased, tonight it was not edible. I was choking while trying to eat it. And i am not sensitive to \"heat\". I'd like to see more consistency from this place. This is one of my MANY negative experiences. But it's convenient and in the same center as my workplace so i can vouche it's decent 40% of the time. Try a salad. Never failed me. The service with the lady who rung me up was helpful and she was kind. After spending $50 on two items I'm EXTREMELY disappointed. Don't see myself ever recommending this for lunch to my co workers again.",

Our food was great and the beer is superb. I ordered the Chicken Alfredo and my garlic knot didn't come with it. Server said they were waiting on them. No big deal. A few minutes later, the manager comes over and apologized for the wait. Then instead of the one that comes with the meal, they give me three. Our second trip to a Brewhouse, our second great experience!!",

    "text": "Came for dinner with my husband. It was busy because of football, but we were seated right away. The server took 15 minutes to get our drink order. We were annoyed, but I try to cut servers some slack, especially on busy nights. When he finally showed up, he took our full order, which came really fast. He never checked in with us, and my husband had to chase him down for refills. Meanwhile, our waiter is actually sitting down at the table behind us, giving them his Facebook info so they can add him.  This stuff is annoying, but had he pulled it together for the bill, we'd have given three stars. Clearly, that's not what happened. Instead he took 30 minutes to get our bill from us. At the 20 minute mark, my husband walked up to the waiter at a station and tried to hand him a card. Without looking up, he told my husband he needed to sit down and wait. We weren't trying to be pushy, but 20 minutes is a long time to wait for a bill, and we needed to leave. At that point I went up front and asked for the manager, who couldn't have cared less about what her employees were doing. Total waste of money and time.",

    "text": "Let me start with I was on a much needed date night with my hubby while the kids greyed grandmas hair for the weekend. We were seated at a greasy table top and the seat cushions had grease and food particles on it. Not good and I'm wearing all white! I only rate with three stars because of the lack of cleanliness of the restaurant. The food,drinks and service was great! But back to my issue, I don't know how well they clean and sanitize their cloth napkins that the silverware is wrapped in and we use on our face (the corner of your mouth) but for the sake of the community's health, I hope very well! I found five cloth napkins in total on the floor under my table and the surrounding tables ( I counted on my way to the restroom).... I noticed a little extra cushion under my stiletto and my husband stepped on something that poked the bottom of his shoe and that's when he noticed a couple of forks under our table as well. This is when I began to look around and noticed more than I wanted to. Upon picking up the napkins I saw silverware and trash at all of the surrounding booths! We brought it to our waiters  attention and he was highly disappointed. As we finished our meal a bus boy came by to \"clean\" the booth next to ours and we understood! He spent five seconds (literally) wiping down the table with a dirty damp cloth and did a quick swiffer wipe on one seat cushion and neglected the other! He didn't bother to look under the table or properly wipe down the entire seating area... it was a total hit and miss. All in all the food, drinks and service are always great but the cleanliness gets worse with each visit....",

She's very attentive, always asks how we are doing,  and takes great care of us...it's nice to feel like you are welcome and wanted. So I only feel right giving her a 5star review.  However be warned, on Sunday night there is a snarky older lady with short hair,  in the bar area that makes you feel unwanted and like you are wasting her time, she walks away while you are talking to her as if she cutting you off and interrupts you as if she needs you to hurry up, on everything. We have tried to give her the benefit of the doubt a couple times but now   we just avoid going on Sunday nights.",

Not sure what happened but the experience was not what we anticipated. I ordered chicken cobb salad (how can salad get screwed up?). Not sure if it was the dressing, lettuce or cucumber but tasted like it had been doused with bad cologne. My gut still wrenches at the thought. Didn't complain because didn't want to embarrass friends, and they were buying. Just packed up what was left, took it home and threw it out. Husband ordered spaghetti which he said was extremely dry. He didn't want to complain for same reason as me. If I was paying that salad would've been sent back! I'll give you one more chance BJ's. Don't disappoint me.",

Waited 20 minutes for a side salad and another 10 for dressing. Waited about 45 minutes for our food. The food was extremely hot from sitting under the heat lamps for so long which made the \"crispy fried shrimp\" taste rubbery. Asked for a refill on drinks when the food arrived (45 minute wait for a refill). Sent the shrimp back, took a box to go for the steak. Ended up paying $40 to watch my husband eat his dinner. Server didn't seem to care about the service or customer satisfaction and experience. Will never visit this location again. Waste of money.",

I can't find anything wrong with a warm cookie topped with ice cream, except maybe for how long it takes them to make it (so order early) and how bad it is for you lol.  The downsides for me: dinner, drinks, and dessert at this chain restaurant really add up.  It's not the cheapest.  Also, the service can be pretty slow and the place gets packed.  You can call ahead to put your name on the list so I recommend this if you're going on the weekend.    I'm so pleased with the food here that I'm sure I'll keep on coming back.

    "text": "Me and some friends strolled in on a Sunday afternoon.  They were serving brunch and the regular menu.  Oh-my, brunch, you say?  So I take a look at their brunch menu, but nothing I saw looked inviting so I decided to order the gluten free pizza with pepperoni, jalapenos, brussel sprouts, and mushrooms along with the beet arugula salad side.  The pizza was tasty and better than some gluten free pizzas I have had, but it was a little small and they were a little too greedy on the toppings - there was even one slice that had looked like it had nothing but cheese on it.    The beet arugula salad side was really just that - a side, but for $4.95, you'd think it would be more than 5 bites, right or is it just me thinking that it should be more like 10 bites?  It's just arugula, beets, some kind of nut, and dressing - so I would think they would be more generous.    All in all, it's a brewery - with \"ok\" food, but I did expect that.",

Mom only likes thin crust pizza & dad loves beer, neither have been to BJ's cause where they used to live doesn't have one so trusted me to order for them.  Taylor helped w/ the beer & since it's Oktoberfest, brought us a sample.  Mom & I decided on the four-beer tasting & dad got the Oktoberfest Lager.  Paired perfectly w/ our pizza & the Cardinal's baseball game as we sat in a large lounge booth.    (Mom & I's ratings of our Four-Beer Tasting .. Harvest Hef & Oktoberfest were our fav!  Jeremiah Red was Tangy & the Brewette was heavy.)  I ordered them my fav's & the best of both worlds, savory & sweet!  The BJ's Classic Combo 9' Deep Dish Pizza & the mini Salted Caramel Pizookie to share!  They loved it & mom said it wa the best deep dish ever!    I ordered off the salad & pizza off of the lunch menu.  The seasonal Watermelon & Feta Salad, was lite, delish & the watermelon was sweet!  Also a 6' Deep Dish Pepperoni Pizza.  We arrived earlier than the happy hour, which starts at 3pm, but they have an excellent lunch menu & portion size is filling!    Overall, an A+ experience & I have dined at this BJ's about five times before.  I have sat twice in the dining area & the rest at the bar/lounge area.  I love the beers & food, but mostly Taylor stood out enough for me to want to leave a five star review.  Thank you!",

Staff was very friendly and food came out fairly fast. Food was very good. Ended the night with a Cinnamon Toast Crunch pizookie... and it was AMAZING. Would have snapped some pictures of our food but we obviously were hungry. Ordered the tri tip and chicken, chicken barbacoa, two Nashville chicken sandwiches, a child's pepperoni pizza and child's hamburger. Will definitely return.",

Was our server and wow so attentive. Here's an example of how attentive he was. My 2 year old son was playing with he's straw and \"accidentally\" dropped it. Without any hesitation Matt brought us another straw.   The meal pace was great as well. We ordered fried cheese curds and they were out within 10 minutes. We ordered our entrees and were out in 20 minutes and then we ordered the salted caramel pizookie. I specifically told Matt to remind me about the pizookie because that's the only reason we're here! It was out in 5 minutes. I'm so happy with the quality and service and I'm more than happy to update my review and give BJ's Brewhouse a 5 out of 5! Please see our food selections in my photos!   See you soon BJ's!",

I could see two complete rows of booths empty ay 4:15 today there were also five other couples and family's waiting, we have been seated 2 times in the past. Obviously the GM doesn't have a clue how to run a business or give a dam. The hostesses should be fired they don't acknowledge you and are very rude. Again the GM's Problem. How do you give them a good review when they haven't done anything to get one. Corporate should shut this location down and retrain the staff on how to be a real employee not some doofuses putting in time for minimal wages. One star is 10 times to much.  Follow up visit 4:00 pm 5/4/19 exactly the same nothing has changed. Didn't have enough help to seat us. But they could seat us next to the hot windows in another room where no one else was seated. Looking around there were plenty of booths open with some between occupied booths unbelievable bad management. Don't waste your time trying this place even if it is free.",

While waiting, they had posters of different specials they had each day, and I believe their burgers were 50% off one day and they also had $3 pizookies on Tuesdays!   I decided to try their Long Island Ice Tea, and let me tell you - the strongest I've had it so far! Also worth it. Ordered the avocado bacon burger well done and got some fries with it. My mom ordered the chicken alfredo pasta and my uncle ordered a different pasta with shrimp in it but I can't remember the exact name. Service was a little slow but it's understandable because it during a dinner rush!   My uncle had never been to a BJ's restaurant so we ordered the trio pizookie option and got peanut butter, salted caramel, and white chocolate macadamia nut. And for about $9, that's a GREAT price considering you can try THREE different pizookies!",

The chicken was cooked to perfection.  Juicy and not dried.  And the barbacoa-spiced flavor was just ... mmmm.... good.  Chicken was tooped with the fire roasted tomato salsa which complemented well with the chicken and brown rice.   I couldn't stop raving on how good this chicken was.  I omitted the black beans.  The brown rice was topped with feta cheese, cilantro, and crema.  I honestly didn't care for the crema.  But other than that, awesome.  If I could make my chicken like this everyday, I could eat this everyday.    Staff is friendly and service was great.  In the past I've tried their lunch Spaghetti with meatballs and that too was really good.  Although the menu is big with a variety of choices (which I hate only because there is sooooo much good stuff to choose from), everything so far has been delish and this is definitly a place to go too for your picky eaters in your group.",

They sat us fairly quickly at a table, however, due to the fact that our toddler was asleep we requested a booth. There were plenty of booths available, however, they (the two hostesses in the front working at that time) proceeded to make a server clean a dirty one, which then took over 15 minutes. Once seated the seats were still dirty and we told the lady to which she just blankly stared at us like \"not my problem\"! I took one of the table napkins and began cleaning the seats in front of the blonde hostess. She did not even apologize or try to get anyone to clean it for us. She just sat the menus on the table and told us about the daily special! Like it was no big deal. That is not proper customer service and that is why we walked out.",

Bjs also happens to have a wide variety of tasty eats and they brew there own beer...big bonus  and a wide variety of other brews and cocktails.    I mostly get veggie burgers,you can substitute veggie or portobello on any of the burger selections. They also offer vegan friendly apps etc.   My wife gets mini deep dish pizza and says it's fantastic.   Today I had Bjs Jeremiah Red house beer and then tried the Jerry Burst, that is berry burst cider mixed with Jeremiah Red. Pretty tasty it turns the beer into more of a sweet treat.   That wraps today's visit.",

    "text": "A business associate who works in Vegas invited me to dinner on a Thursday night.  Since he lives and works in this city, he didn't want to go anywhere particularly touristy, so he brought me here to this restaurant, which is about 5 miles away from the strip.  BJ's is a national chain restaurant and microbrewery which is a bit like Gordon Biersch, but BJ's features a few more comfort foods on their menu and it has more of a family restaurant feel to it.  This restaurant is located in a strip mall-type location where there are several storefronts with bars and restaurants, and I get the feeling this must be mecca for many locals, as the parking lot of the entire complex was packed on this night, and we had to wait 20 - 25 minutes for a table for 2 at 7:30 on a Thursday.  I tried their Pumpkin Ale (one of my favorite fall beverages) and was a fan.  For our meal we shared an order of their Ahi Poke which was delicious and really hit the spot since I was very hungry.  For dinner, my friend had the chicken fried steak, and on his suggestion I had the old fashioned pot roast which was served with white cheddar mashed potatoes, mushroom gravy and veggies.  Everything I had was excellent, service on this night was very good aside from one slip up (they only gave us one set of cutlery and it was difficult to find a service staff to get a second set).  I'd like to return to one of their locations at some point to try more of their other microwbrews.",

Unfortunately I chose to have dinner last  night at the Eastern Ave location in Las Vegas with a friend. Wait for table was short as stated. Nicholas, our server, was dismissive and blamed the long wait for our food on inexperienced kitchen staff . When food finally came, IT WAS COLD. As it probably stood in the kitchen for at least 10 minutes. Requested onion rings instead of fries. Greasy and cold. Will NOT recommended and will NEVER eat at this BJs again. Do yourself a favor and go to In-n-Out Burger instead. Better tasting burgers and much better service because at least there you get what you pay for. Not at this BJs",

Long story short was told happy hour was going on, ordered accordingly, was told happy hour was mistakenly announced and we were charged full price.  Ordered our food, mother's spaghetti was cold.  Server argued that they do not know how that could happen and could warm it in the microwave or \"remake\" it.  Manager came and try to argue the same point.  At least he didn't say they could warm it in the microwave but then again wen didn't give him a chance.  We chose to microwave it at home ourselves and left it on the table.  It WAS taken off our bill though. Not impressed and will not be back.

    "text": "This was our second visit to BJ's.  We dined at a time when the sun setting and the shades they have are not sufficient to block it out. We were all seeing spots in our eyes for quite a while  from the brightness. We asked to change our table, and the second one was a little better but there was still too much sun filtering through the shades. they have what looks like wooden blinds in the front of the restaurant that they should also put on the side windows.   Our server was very friendly, but severely lacking in being observant and listening. She took drink orders for my husband and son, but didn't ask me if I wanted anything.   I ordered a dinner salad with chicken. Son had a steak and husband had a quinoa bowl. I am a rather slow eater, and my family finished before me. The server came over and asked if we were ready for dessert. I was shocked, as I was clearly still eating. I told her I was still enjoying my salad and she said the pizzookie takes a while, so we should order it even though I was still eating. Well, here I am eating my dinner and less than 5 minutes later the food runner brings this hot cookie topped with ice cream over to our table. I called our server over and told her I was still eating. She asked me if I wanted a box for my salad. I said no, and SHE TOOK IT RIGHT OUT FROM IN FRONT OF ME! MY FORK WAS STILL IN MY HAND!  She also left the check and told us to have a good evening.   When she came back for the check, I told her I was shocked that she insisted we order dessert while I was still eating and that she also took my meal before I was finished. She smiled, asked if I enjoyed it and made no apologies. When I asked for a manager, she said she was new and would get in trouble, left the check for me to sign and we didn't see her again.   My son said while the steak was good, he felt a little queazy after the meal. I enjoyed the salad, but would have enjoyed it more if I had been able to finish it. I hope a manager reads this and responds appropriately.",

The service was kind of slow, and when the waitress did come to us we felt rushed to hurry and get our words out because she needed to go to the next table. The food is good tho, but if you order the tomato soup, it's very oily. But everything else was good.",

    "text": "Who loves BJ's ?? ok kids get your mind out of the gutter.    Let's talk about the food.   They have a variety of food from burgers, pastas, salads  and pizzas.  I know they are popular for their pizzas, but it's too \"doughy\" for me.  I guess similar to like a deep dish pizza, so when friends want to share a pizza I suggest the flatbread.  I've tried various dishes on their menu, even visited during happy hour, but the only dish that I enjoyed is their ahi tuna salad.        ok ... the REAL reason why I come to BJ's is when you have that craving for a warm cookie topped off with ice cream ... pizookie yuuummmm!! White macadamia used to be my favorite, but now they have salted caramel and I definitely won't choose any other.      Oh and if this place becomes a place you enjoy don't forget to ask for a BJ's card. COME to BJ's ... earn points  (once again mind out of the gutter).  This is cool because they send you offers periodically, and the points accumulate to free entrees or desserts.",

The food was on par, the service was excellent and we even got the manager to come to our table and take a pic with us and a friend we had brought in with us to try their famous Pazookie dessert.  I tried the deep dish Pepperoni and 5 cheese pizza and my ex had a BBQ Brisket sandwich.  We practice Dicing 2 eat so the die each made us try a different drink, I had a Black cherry handcrafted soda which I didnt think was that great and he had a soda.      Super crowded but that is usually a good sign and wait time was very minimal.   oh and they have a revolving door to get in and out which I love!  The second time we came here, I tried the Paella.   Delicious, not as spicy as they claim it to be but most of the food that people say is spicy doesnt really seem so much so to me, I am so used to eating really spicy food I guess  :/        My friend had a steak which was excellent of course.  Our Third experience here which was tonight was not that great as far as service goes.   It started off alright and of course the food was excellent as always, The die made me try a flatbread pizza which for me was new as I usually prefer deep dish when we come here, I have had a mini deep dish in the past which was awesome!       My ex who was with me had to try a cocktail called The Strawberry Smash which he said he liked.     And he ordered the bbq Brisket sandwich again which was just as good as the first time he ordered it.    Great thing about Bj's seems to be the food is always consistantly good!  When we finished eating though, service became slow and they werent that busy, our waiter disappeared and we waited a full 15 minutes before we finally asked a random server if he could bring us to go boxes for the leftover pizza, some for me, some for him to take.     We waited another 10 mins and never saw our server again, we asked if someone else could take the check for us so we could get going and the man told us that our server was in the back and he would make sure he was told we were ready to go.    Another 10 mins and we were still waiting so we asked a 3rd server if we could pay and he took the credit card and came back a few minutes later.  We never saw our server again, no goodbye, sayonara, adios, nothing!    No worries though, we are 20%++ tippers when we are happy and we just were not this time, next time we will ask for a different server.",

    "text": "My friend and I went to the Henderson, NV restaurant on July 20, 2017.   I ordered a chicken club sandwich with sweet potato fries and coleslaw. My friend had the bison burger.   First the sandwich. I come from NY. A club sandwich, aka Triple-Decker has FRESH turkey, bacon, lettuce/tomato with 3 slices of bread and mayo. THAT is a REAL club sandwich. A sliced chicken sandwich from processed chicken as you'd get in a deli on 2 slices of bread is NOT a club sandwich, not now, not ever. I didn't eat it and turned it back, then didn't order anything else. The fries were sparse. The coleslaw.... large chunks of cabbage in a tiny bowl. I make awesome coleslaw at home and have had some of the best coleslaw outside. But this... surely needs to be changed. NEVER use large pieces of cabbage... just as you wouldn't put a thick piece of tomato on a sandwich. This was about the worst I've had.  My friend's burger... dried, nothing special.   The waitress was great.  Personally, I should have known better than to go to a chain restaurant, where everything is tasteless and way over-salted. My fault.  We are very disappointed and will not return.   America... Chain restaurants, ala Red Lobster and Olive Garden, use loads of sodium. We all know that no matter how old we are, salt is bad for your heart. If not as a teen, then when you get older. It's a fact. Why chains do this is beyond me. Red Lobster packs their fish in frozen ice salt. Their sauces are way oversalted. This is what they told me. Same for Olive Garden. Salt does not bring out the taste... it eventually hurts your organs. Better to find a mom 'n pop shop, not a corporate chain restaurant.  There is no shortage of restaurants. Be wise when you choose. I do not suggest BJ's as your place of choice to eat.. 2 times there and I'm done.",

For the next 40 mins, the waitress (who was very nice) kept telling us my wife's and ours would be out soon. Then she and the manager said they had to remake the pizza. So they offered the kids a cookie to keep them occupied...and that never came. So I finally canx our order because eventually you need to keep a 3yrld and 5yrld moving. So they bring the check and say the food's now ready and would they would box it up...but took NOTHING off the bill. I ask for the manager (Chris), ask him if he would typically do something for a customer that waits an hour for food, and he argues with me, telling me we haven't been there an hour. Really? I call him out on it, so he wipes the kids meal off the tab. Probably just a bad day, but definitely an opportunity for Chris to refresh a couple of his manager training classes.",

IT WAS SOOOOO BAD !!!!  then my ribs came ........ they literally cooked unseasoned ribs and just slapped some bbq sauce on them. they were sooooooo terrible. the customer service is AMAZING tho !!! that's why they got 2 stars .",

You can add yourself to the waitlist, order ahead for dine in or take out, see your rewards points, and actually pay on the app.  Being able to add yourself to the waitlist before you get there comes in handy since there seems to be a perpetual wait at the Eastern location.     This review is for our last two visits because they were so close together.  Both times we were seated within a couple of minutes because we used the app waitlist and on both occasions we had good service and flavorful food and libations.  However the comfort level of their seating varies greatly depending on where you are seated.  The larger booths are roomy, but the smaller 2 person booths don't have enough space, especially if you order a pizza that takes up most of the table.  I wish they would only use these tables if they don't have any other open spaces.  Beverages: LightSwitch Lager (4/5) & Top Shelf Margarita (3/5) Appetizer: Crispy Fried Artichokes with lemon garlic aioli (4/5) and House Salad (3/5) Pizza: Vegetarian Signature Deep Dish (mushrooms, green peppers, black olives, onions, seasoned tomatoes) 4/5 Sandwich: Roast Beef Dip (5/5) Burger: Crispy Jalapeno (4/4)",

Then 20 mins passed, wasn't sure how much longer it was going to be? The waitress said it shouldn't be long. Our food finally arrived. They didn't modify my daughter's order like they should...I was heated. It took forever and my daughter was hungry. The runner told me there wasn't a allergy alert on the ticket. I asked for a manager. She came and apologized and told me there was a allergy alert on the ticket. Idk who's lying here. The waitress already lied to me about not having a problem. The manager came back 10mins later with the correct order. By then my lunch was cold. I had the chicken with rice pilaf and it didn't taste good. Had a few bites and I was done. Not going back again. Not a place for people with food allergies, the wait time is long, and the food was meh.",

The stir-fry veggie-pineapple fried rice was yummy and filling.  Sooo... I couldn't help but cheat just a little... but how can you go to BJ's and resist the Avocado Egg Rolls?!  I suppose you could if you didn't like avocados.. but if you're a fan and you haven't tried them, definitely give them a go on your next visit! :)",

    "text": "Finally!  A BJ's in Henderson!  This location opened about a month ago, and from the business it was doing this past Friday night, it's going to be around for a long time.  The food is as good as I remember from my few visits to the Summerlin location.  The pizzas are fantastic (try the BJ's favorite or the Great White).  The loaded baked potatoes are gigantic and filled to the brim with your choice of toppings (the garden veggie and chili cheese are delicious).  And the salads, especially the field greens and the bbq chopped, are enormous and really tasty.  I went with a group of 8 people and our food came out relatively quickly (especially considering how busy it was).  The staff was friendly and accommodating.  I'd recommend a visit!  Just a word of advice: if you're planning on visiting this location on a friday night or over the weekend, I'd recommend calling ahead and getting yourself on the wait list (it gets really busy!).  The restaurant only takes reservations for groups larger than 10, but if you call ahead about an hour before you want to eat, the greeter will put your name on the wait list and you'll get a table pretty quickly.",

Honestly, I haven't been to this BJ's location since my birthday 2 1/2 years ago, which was an absolutely horrific experience.  This evening I decided to give it another go, since it's so close to home, well thankfully, this experience was like night and day, in comparison to 2 years ago.  Vicki was my server; she was friendly, my order was correct, and has ensured I will return to this location sooner rather than later (but only if I get to sit in her service section.)",

I was so disappointed at the customer service. We were seated after about 10 minutes. Then 20 minutes passed and we were never even acknowledged by anyone! 3 sets of customers sat in our aisle after us and all had their drinks and orders in. I have no idea how they could ignore a table.The wait staff was congregated at the restroom entrance, no sense of customer service. I spoke with the Manager and all he did was apologize. We walked out. THE WORST service ever!!!",

Bring drinks, don't take food order; bring order, but don't bring the meals for the kids because you can't carry everything.  How about just get the kids first, then the rest?  Drop off to go boxes after meal and not the check, too.  Lost 10-15 minutes of time waiting for huge gaps in service.  Food was fine, but I as a patron should not have to ask \"could you take my order\" or \"could I have my check\" when clearly I was ready for both at those times.    Our server was either new or just not ready for work that day because she was operating in slow motion compared to her coworkers.",

I always liked it, but for some reason over the last few years I don't think the quality of the food has been good.  My husband and I went here a few weeks ago for a quick meal because it was so close to our home and we hadn't eaten all day, since I was testing for my PMP exam that day (I passed, yay).  I probably should have dragged him someplace better to celebrate, but I was so exhausted from not sleeping and stressing over this exam to the point where I was sick, that I just wanted to go somewhere and get food and unwind with a few beers.  I had the grilled shrimp tacos because I wasn't in the mood for pizza with a side salad, and my husband got a medium pepperoni pizza.  The pizza is the same here as the other locations, has the big chunks of tomato with little sauce (unless you ask for extra like he does).  The shrimp tacos were pretty mediocre, but being that it was a deep dish pizza joint and not a mexican restaurant, I didn't expect them to be wonderful.  But I also didn't expect them to be so \"blah,\" either and I wouldn't order them again.  I wouldn't go out of my way to go here, and I think the beer at Ellis Island is much much better.  However, being that it was down the street from where I live, I'll probably go here again.",

When we mentioned to server that we were about to leave, she apologized and gave an excuse of a server got \"cut\", so she will be starting our drink order. Decided to stay. Another server came 10 minutes after our drinks arrived to take our food order. Finally at 11:30pm, we are eating...yay! Food is good. Our table had a couple burgers, rib eye steak, chicken alfredo, and a salmon salad. Looking around our table, there are no complaints about the food. Server had no name tag, so I had to ask for his name. His name is Eric. There is only around table and another table of people right now, so I don't understand why service is so BAD! So long story, short...food is good but service is HORRIBLE! PEOPLE BEWARE!!!!!",

    "text": "We were shopping in the area and wanted something cool to drink, also realizing we probably could handle a snack as well. Rather than hop in the car and head somewhere else, we popped in here to check it out.  Three words: Small bites menu.   The spinach stuffed mushrooms were plentiful and really tasty, with just a hint of spice. The caps were large and generously stuffed.  The caprese (mozzarella salad) was OK. Not bad, but just OK. There was something odd about it and I didn't care for the parmesan cheese. Let the tomatoes and mozzarella do their thing; something about the extra cheese and the way it was dressed just made it... well, OK.  The fried artichokes were a bit heavy for me, but that's just personal preference talking. They were crispy on the outside, tender on the inside, and really, really tasty. My guests dug into them with abandon and didn't leave a crumb untouched. Very well done.  The seared ahi was absolutely perfect. This was really the only dish that was small - four pieces? - but at the price they offer it, it's a fabulous little snack and exactly what they portray it to be. The dipping sauce was flavorful, didn't seem laden with salt (a very good thing) and had a great little kick to it. Standout little dish.  We also had a couple of salads that were really fresh; the flavors of the vegetables and toppings were bright and clean.   The \"spicy\" bloody mary wasn't; the waitress admitted it was from a mix and that they couldn't really do much to it for me. She brought some Tabasco sauce which helped, but as it wasn't fresh, it was really just a mix with some vodka and Tabasco. Not horrible (of course I drank it!) but not a good, hand-crafted bloody mary.  And, all this for less than $30.   It's a 3-star (A-OK) place, for sure. The service is what made it a 4 for us. It's a chain and it's a bit cookie-cutter, but that works here. Definitely a respectable, repeatable dining experience.",

Anyway.. I'll come back ..maybe on a Tuesday afternoon though .",

    "text": "Ok so I think i have about had it with this place. Other bj's are sooo much better but the service at this one sucks!  They have failed miserably like 5 times in a row. The thing is the foods always pretty good and the beer is great. But having to wait 30 minutes for a pitcher of beer or to even see your server is unacceptable. The sweet pig pizza and j. Red beer is great and keep is coming back but maybe not worth it in the end with grimaldis acrossnthe street  .... So i went back again (dont ask) and was the same old story....terrible service and people angry all around us. Manager took forever to get to tables who had issues and was a disaster. I flat out asked the server \" why is the service always so bad here\"' it cant be a server issue if its always bad... It has to be a management issue with payroll or terrible training! She only had 5 tables and was not double sat so i really have no clue other than the service always sucks and the food/beer is always good",

    "text": "Used to love this place but it has just ran completely downhill, and I will not return. Yesterday (Saturday) I went to lunch around 4 o'clock and was so disappointed. First, upon walking in we were greeted warmly, which was nice. Then, when I requested a booth the hostess seemed put out, but we were seated at a booth regardless. We waited 7 minutes to be greeted by a server. Once we were finally greeted, we were informed we didn't get greeted because the hostess put us in a section that didn't have a server and failed to inform someone to pick our table up. Ok, I guess. At least it wasn't the servers fault. When we finally order, I ordered their enlightened turkey burger, and asked for our sever (I believe his name was Steve or Steven) to ring it in just as a turkey burger with lettuce, onion, and avocado. My guest ordered the California club. When our food finally arrived, we both take a bite out of it, as we were starving. To our dismay, both of our orders are wrong. My turkey burger is not a turkey burger at all, but a veggie burger. (Granted, this veggie burger was tasty. I definitely recommend for vegetarians.) My guest takes a bite out of her sandwich, which doesn't have the bacon or tomatoes on it it is supposed to have (and that is pictured.) I send my not-turkey burger back and her sandwich. The server apologizes, and we wait. My burger finally arrives, and it is still wrong. The toppings that are supposed to be on the burger, are not. My server goes and gets the toppings that are supposed to be on it and returns a few minutes later. Situation rectified. My guests sandwich finally arrives, with the bacon and tomato, but they didn't replace the sandwich? They bring back the same sandwich with her bite still taken out of it? I'm not sure how sanitary that is that the cooks are touching foods that have been partially eaten and sending it back out!   Although all three mistakes were remedied, I'm severely disappointed a manager did not stop by the table to at least apologize or table tough at all. Our server was not bad, as I'm sure these were errors in the kitchen. Ultimately though, I'm disappointed and will not be returning to BJs due to the consistent errors.",

    "text": "Unfortunately, my review of this place is a combination of 2 visits: 1 being a 4-star, and the other being a 2-star, hence a 3-star total.  I came here last week and met a friend for dinner.  We sat in the bar area were immediately greeted by a server.  She was friendly and helpful.  We ordered burgers, both of which were amazing.  I got the Bacon Cheeseburger with a Chipotle mayo and he got the California burger.  They were huge and I could barely finish mine.  It always seems busy there, but we didn't have to wait on the server.  I actually really like the busy atmosphere.  I came here again with my best friend and goddaughter yesterday.  We were craving bloodies and my goddaughter wanted ice cream so this seemed like the perfect spot.  Right off the bat, the hostesses seemed completely uninterested and in a simple word, LAME.  Their attitude screamed \"It's Easter, I don't want to be here.\"  They were just so blah and unfriendly.  Anyway, after asking if the outside patio area was shaded, she said yes and that there was a table.  She seated us out there at the one table that didn't have an umbrella.  Luckily another table was just finishing up so we moved over as soon as they left.    We got our bloodies and ice cream and were pretty happy then.  Our server was nice enough and to our surprise, we were on happy hour the entire time so our bloodies were $1 off.  The other thing that would contribute to the 2 stars is that several other tables left as we sat there and no one ever bussed the tables.  It just looked sloppy and gross.",

For $20 bucks you get 2 soups or salads, one medium pizza, and a shared poozkie (thats a desert).  Then you pay $15 and get 2 movie tickets to a regal cinema.    I thought there had to be a catch but nope it was totally legit. The medium pizza is seriously HUGE. We couldn't finish the thing and i had to bring the rest home because it was just that good. We ordered the sweet pig pizza. It has real ham and chucks of pineapple on it. AWESOMEEEEEEE  The clam chowder was crazy. This is the first place that served me clam chowder that i didn't have to doctor up with a little salt and pepper. My wife ordered the tomato soup and that was pretty decent as well.   The servers are always really nice here and don't allow us to run dry on drinks or feel neglected. The only thing stopping a five star rating is well, actually nothing. Im changing this sucker to 5 stars.",

And rightly so they do have some excellent things before they change the jambalaya it was my very favorite. And the Jeremiah red is the best micro brew available in a restaurant chain. I am @ at BJ's today with my mother in law and enjoyed a mushroom Portobello swiss burger rare the first time it came out was not correct however the server rectify the situation quickly and I had a wonderful meal. But he insisted to call the manager over which seemed rather unconcerned  with  problem with the food. Despite the lack of managerial assistance the meal went great.",

William \"bill\" was our server. He was very cool and professional. He took our drink orders first. I ordered the blood orange sangria, which was very tart until I put the cinnamon stick garnish into it, after that it tasted great! It was happy hour at the bar, so we ordered the California flatbread as an appetizer, which was delicious and portioned big enough for us to share! For dinner I ordered the \"super salad\" with flame broiled salmon which was AMAZING! The salmon had wonderful flavor and I loved all the different fruits and veggies in my salad. My boyfriend ordered a burger and my mom had the roasted Brussels and kale salad. They both enjoyed their meals as well! For dessert, my boyfriend had a mini chocolate chip pazookie, free for his birthday. Came with a birthday candle and smile from our server, thanks bill! And my mom and I shared half macadamia nut, half chocolate chip pazookie which was delicious! I would definitely come here again.",

    "text": "Cap'n Crunch French Toast = YES PLEASE!!!!!!!!  It sounded so fantastic that we ordered 3 for the table. There were 13 of us who met up for brunch......on Mothers Day!   We tried and failed at Crepe Expectations, we tried and failed at Blue Island (it was going to be their last day of business as owners had bailed on business the waiter/host advised). I called Republic and they couldn't seat us til 4. I called here and they said it would be about 40 minutes. We got there about 25 minutes later and they told us it would be about 25-35 minutes. Mothers Day is quite the day for brunch/breakfast/lunch.  It was slow to start, the drink order took a while. Then we had to order our food, then wait for it. But, once one meal came out, they all came out pretty quick after that.   Back to those Cap'n Crunch french toast.......they came out first. They were OK. I think we all dreamed of TASTING Cap'n Crunch in the french toast. But you dont. You want to, you know it's there, but it doesnt taste like it one bit. It doesnt taste bad, not at all, but it doesnt taste like you imagine it will.   The table ordered a ton of food: Breakfast pizza, Surf n Turf, french toast, shrimp taco's, pulled pork sandwich, ahi tuna salad, breakfast sandwich and a few others I'm forgetting. The portions are nice size. The potatoes with the breakfast pizza weren't seasoned well. There was way to much omelette on the pizza. The cheese could have melted more too. I think everyone was so hungry, and the food was OK, we ate. But I dont think anyone had anything spectacular that I'd rush back for. Although, I did hear they have a dessert that's a cookie in a cast iron skillet that they bake fresh with ice cream on top. That sounded so good. But maybe it's like the Cap'n Crunch french toast. Disappointing :(",

I have a flatbread with bacon and ranch, super good. Everyone else in the group seemed to really enjoy their food. Those next to me had these massive burgers that they scarfed down.

We had just finished drinking some of the finest beers available in Vegas (and some not available in Vegas).    To drink I had the house brown ale.  It was sweet, dark, and very malty.  There was a strange chemical taste to it as well, perhaps.  I tried some of my friend's stout, and it was also pretty mediocre.  His description of this stout is classic, \"It reminds me of Pirates of the Caribbean.\"  What a great description, ha!  However bad the brewery is here, the guest beer selection is amazingly great, and completely makes up for it.    If you aren't a beer drinker, the food here is worth having too.  I had the shrimp pasta, and loved it entirely.  It was more dry than typical restaurant pastas, which I loved because the sauces these places use usually get gross after a while.  I could eat this pasta all day.  It might have been a little over priced, but I didn't mind at all.  My friend had a big deep dish pizza.  I didn't try any, but it looked delicious (and he confirmed this for me).  We also had the potato skins as an appetizer, and again a huge hit.  These were big thick potato chunks with skin, along with bacon and cheese.  Yummy.  They came with ranch and sour cream sauces.  A little expensive, and the house brewery didn't impress me (as a craft beer drinker), but the guest beer selection was great.  The food was definitely top notch for a hipster type restaurant.  I'd go again!",

    "text": "Went here for a family dinner with the monkeys and friend. BJ's has always been a random craving of mine...when its met...I don't need it again for quite sometime. This was one of those nights that I needed it and might have traded my kids for it (just maybe).  We roll in and there was a small wait...no biggie. I situate the kids with their DVD players and my friend grabs two beers from the bar (I had girly cider...I thought I was ordering their homemade berry beer...I guess they don't make it anymore...bummer) and my friend got some sort of IPA...quite good. BZZZZZ...our pager goes off (much to the delight of my kids) and my daughter rips it out of my hand to give it to the hostess (she's a tenacious little bugger).  We were sat at a lovely booth (perfect for kids) and decided to get the Ahi Poke to start. It was yummy with wonton chips that kind of reminded me of Sun Chips, big chunks of yellowfin tuna, avocado, cabbage and vinaigrette. All of it was good except for the avocado which could have been a bit more ripe but it was certainly edible.  The pizza was next and it was good but it didn't knock my socks off (pepperoni, mushroom, extra cheese and sausage). The stewed tomatoes were excellent but the crust was a bit gooey-er than I remember....nothing a side of ranch couldn't fix. I downed two pieces (no one could ever accuse me of having an eating disorder).  Lastly, we were all full but we couldn't leave without trying one of their famous Pizzoki and Creme. They have expanded their pazzoki selection and now offer a trio so you can sample more of what they have to offer. We went for the chocolate chip, Oreo and oatmeal raisin. Holy cow was that tasty. My son very much liked the chocolate chip and Oreo however my daughter just went for the ice cream.   All in all I was a very happy camper. The service is fine but nothing to write home about. Will be back when the next craving hits or maybe sooner because they have a gluten-free pizza that my mom can enjoy as well.",

From both dining in, taking out and delivery I've ALWAYS had my orders wrong and have always had to get it remade (which I hate having to send food back).  This time I gave their delivery a try. NOPE! Maybe it's the fact that it is a third party delivery so the quality control of their delivery orders is mediocre... if that. My crispy chicken sandwich I ordered only came with Honey mustard on it, literally no lettuce. I did ask for no tomato or pickles so I'm not sure if that is why they didnt add any toppings? I don't even know. But then, the deep dish pizza we ordered as mushroom and pepperoni came as mushroom and sausage. The dough was not cooked all the way through. Maybe the expected us to heat the pizza up when we got it, but either way we've never had any pizza delivered looking like that from anyways.  The pizookies that we ordered were fine  surprisingly. After this experience this will most likely be the last dining experience I will have with Bj's.",

However, our waiter did not know his beers. My husband loves his IPA's. I was facing the board reading the list of IPAs. The waiter read off the IPAs, including the Jeremiah Red which I love and ordered. I questioned the Jeremiah Red being an IPA and insisted it was. I've never heard this before and being a fan of the Jeremiah Red, and not a fan of IPAs i found this very questionable. He proceeded to convince my husband that it is in fact an IPA. On the board it is not listed in the IPA column. He ordered it and I ended up drinking it and he ordered an IPA instead. The other issue I would like to bring up is that under the heading of local beers is one called Bells Brewery. It is not local and in fact produced in Michigan. It recently is being distributed in Nevada but is not a local brewery. Come on BJs, get your facts straight. Educate your servers. We will still be loyal customers.",

The manger did not acknowledge our long time patronage , mocked me when I explained that our favorite waitress had gotten the same  order right in the past.

This place lost 2 long term customers tonight and I say that regretfully as we consider some of the workers there to be friends or regular faces we enjoy greeting on Friday's   It is not unreasonable to be acknowledged for 3 years of being a good customer of BJ's on Eastern instead of a boiler plate condescending response from Kevin M. I would like to thank the team at BJ's on Eastern as they are not the problem. As I said some of the team are friends.

He was great with being knowledgeable and accommodating to our request for ordering appetizers and entrees with no dairy (since I have a mild allergy). We came back in today with our family and had a horrible experience. The server Paul was excellent but the manager on shift was incompetent. We ordered two pizzas, one without cheese and extra sauce. The pizza came out with \"light sauce\" as said by the person who brought the food. The food runner said she would bring a side of extra sauce. She saw how disappointed we were so she offered to have the pizza remade correctly. The manager then approved to have the same pizza put back in the oven with more sauce just added on and he brought the same pizza back out to our table 5 minutes later. We work in the restaurant industry and I have never seen a manager pull this stunt and deliver it to the table himself, especially knowing parts of it were burnt. At this rate we should have just ordered another pizza so it could be made correctly. The worse part is they still charged for the wrong item and the manager never came back to check on us or any other table for that matter. I'm sure we aren't the only party who has had this problem. If the manager is willing to do this to us, how many other people has he done this to? Might seem like a small thing but the bigger picture shows that you play the game how you practice. The manager has made it clear that this is how he wants to run his team. Very, very disappointed!",

Henderson location is the same! Our server was so attentive and we were in the bar area! Even the guy that gave us our food was so happy and excited.  They never rushed us and they made sure that were attended to.  My fish and chips was very crispy and flavorful. The veggie (vegan) was tasty and garnished perfectly! My wife had to have the Poke Salad again and it was just as perfect as before.  We signed up for the app, got a free dessert And started earning points!  Check them out!",

Sorry, but I go out to eat for the food, so this significantly drags down my overall experience (flavor was ok).  I would still recommend this restaurant, but avoid this paltry sandwich.",

I heard of al dente pasta but not al chewy pasta not a fan of the baked ziti, this dish was full of oil which i am not a fan of, but I can say that the clam chowder in the garlic bowl was a good dish along with the tortilla soup.... so all in all the liquid items which include water were on point ...Nicole our server was very adequate as well on time and personable.....",

Another person told the hostess she didn't know how many were in the party but thought it was less than 35. When all 35 showed up the manager was argumentative about the # in our party, seemed irritated that there were more, made little attempt to accommodate us, wouldn't give us a neighboring table. Finally someone had the wherewithal to give us another booth. Never had this level of service at BJs...disappointing.",

Loved their \"blonde\" beer.   It paired well with my Cajun Pasta w/ chicken, a dish I highly recommend getting here.  We also tried their calimari which was standard.   My friend had the southern style fried chicken.  She said it was cooked and seasoned well and not greasy at all!  Great.  There is a separate bar area, plenty of seating in a nicely dim room.  The ambiance was perfect for my group.  Our only small irk was that our server was sometimes not present when we needed him.  Trying to find him for the check after we were already full and ready to go was one thing.  Putting in my debit card with the bill and trying to find him AGAIN just to pay for the darn thing is enough to drop 1 star from this place.    Come for the great selection of beers and the food, keep an eye for your server or he might just get lost for some time.",

I honestly felt so awful because I could tell things out of his control kept happening (POS system went down and deleted orders he submitted  which delayed the food) he apologized and remained polite, and positive during the whole time! He went out of his way to comp 50% or all the entrees and even gave us free sampler appetizers! I truly believe he went above and beyond and genuinely kept his composure while being super friendly!

    "text": "Pros *The food was really delicious.  Everything we tasted was amazing. *Their beer is pretty decent *Their signature dessert is a giant cookie with ice cream.  And the cookie is still hot *The staff was extremely friendly  Cons *My entree was 1600 calories.  Even taking half of it home still resulted in a mega-portion of fat and sodium (I obviously didn't order from the skinny menu) *The Pizookie (dessert cookie) had less fat and calories than my entree.  Since when is dessert the 'healthy' portion of the meal *The timing of our meal was off completely - our appetizer came out just seconds before our entrees and our dessert took another 20 minutes after ordering  We went for a late dinner on a Sunday.  The place was busy but not swamped.  Our waitress was a trainee and she had her trusty \"pro\" shadowing her.  We've all been a trainee before, and I think she did pretty well for a newbie.  The issue here is that at a few points during the evening the \"pro\" came over by himself and spoke with us.  I think it would be beneficial for the trainee to handle all situations instead of confusing the diners with multiple servers.  Somewhere along the way our meal timing got messed up.  The appetizer (poke - absolutely delicious) came out less than a minute before our entrees.  This led to that awkward situation where you try and eat the app as fast as possible so your meal doesn't get cold.  The poke was amazing, so not an issue.  While we were shoveling tuna into our faces, the manager came over.  He profusely apologized for the timing issue and said if we wanted to have a dessert he would pick up the tab on that.  Very nice, we thought, but not needed.  The timing thing wasn't really an issue for us, but it was a really nice gesture on the manager's part.  Please be warned that it's really tough to pick an entree at BJ's.  Their menu is extensive and everything sounds delicious.  The entrees we picked were both fantastic (Chicken Marsala and Tuscan Chicken Limone).  If ever there was a restaurant to not be a fat American, BJ's is it.  Take half home.  Their portions are large and should definitely not be consumed in one sitting.  Since the manager went out of his way to offer us the dessert, we opted for the peanut butter pizookie.  It's a warm peanut butter cookie, about 8\" across, with ice cream on top.  Everyone has an inner fat girl, and she's drooling at the sound of this.  And yes, it's that good.  Ignore the diet, forget about the bathing suit body, just eat the pizookie and enjoy it.  Overall, we had a decent experience at BJ's.  The food is really good, the staff is really friendly, and they seem to genuinely care about making guests happy.  The portions are pretty big, and there was definitely some awkward moments created by the staff, but I think we'll likely return.",

Their new \"Small Plate\" appetizers are awesome and cheap! They also have a low-cal menu section, which is nice, but needs to be expanded. The menu is huge...like Cheesecake Factory huge. Their house brews are great. And the Pizookie is to.die.for. Two people can eat (drinks + entrees) for about $40.  Only 4 stars because of the service. It's hit-or-miss. Generally, food takes quite a while to arrive. The place can get pretty crowded on weekend nights, but the bar area is open seating with full menu.",

We started off with the Fritos nachos which were surprisingly good.  Prices were very reasonable for lunch and will be added to my places to choose from.",

But their bacon is not very good... The place was packed... Usually a good sign... The menu is HUGE... The food that is presented is beautiful to the eyes and the stomach...  I ordered the calzone... It had artichokes and mushrooms and cheese... They need to use just the heart I kept running into the \"leaves\" of the artichoke and they were pithy.. but it was soo good I ate around them... The marinara sauce that goes with the calzone is mmmmm good!   The bf ordered the jambalaya... We were told by at least 3 different servers and a manager that it was \"spicy\" and that made the bf happy!  It had chicken...shrimp...and andouille sausage... He loved it! I thought it was too spicy!  PORTIONS ARE HUGE! Definitely share meals...",

    "text": "Man, I totally made a mess of the evening before, so I had to meet a friend to work out a situation.  We wanted to go to a place that had great food and a great vibe...that I've never been to.  Ok, so I can't lie and say that although we had to talk about something important, a small part of my decision to go to BJs was because A.) I haven't been there, B.) I heard it was really good and C.) It would give me the opportunity to make a review on Yelp :)  This place has a huge buzz, well at least from what I experiences.  True it was on a Saturday night but the place was packed with people, the lighting was hip and the overall vibe made me excited to be there!  They have their own signature brews and offered many menu options?  Uh, yes please!  Our server was quite but didn't a good job.    For my first visit, here's what I got:  Drinks: A couple of glasses of the Piranha Pale Ale.  It's a hoppy ale and had a snappy flavor.  Apparently this beer took Silver in some American beer festival in the past, so I had to try it.    Appetizer: For the table, we got the Thai Shrimp Lettuce Wraps.  Grilled shrimp glazed with spicy Thai sauce, served on a bed of Napa cabbage, cilantro, carrots and red onion, all tossed with a fresh, minty mango salsa and sprinkled with toasted coconut. Served in butter lettuce cups with a spicy Thai sauce for dipping.  The shrimp to everything else ratio was great and the sauce really pulled all the components together.  Sooo good!  A little messy but I definitely looked passed that!  Meal: For my meal, I got the New enLIGHTened Thai chicken mango salad.  Grilled, marinated chicken breast, chili spiced jicama and mango strips, red bell peppers and red onions on a bed of mixed baby greens, bibb lettuce and arugula tossed in a sweet citrus-chili dressing and topped with fresh sliced avocado, mint, green onions and sesame wonton crisps.  Trust me, that description was taken from BJs' website, I'm not that good at descriptions, however, I am good at giving my take on it.  Probably one of the best salads I've ever had.  The spiced jicama complimented the sweet mango and the bell peppers gave a crisp texture.  This salad was packed with seemingly clashing components but it all worked well together.    So for all of you who want to know, yes, we worked out our differences and made a possible bad situation into a completely better one.  I definitely think the food had something to do with it.  The place had a great buzz and I can't wait to come back!  Thanks guys!!",

Dan was speedy and courteous and kind, and our food came out really quickly! Everything was delicious but what made the experience over-the-top great was Dan's professionalism, patience and kindness during our meal. Mid-dessert, my youngest needed to use the restroom so we asked Dan to make sure no one cleared the table while we were away. When we returned, we saw that Dan had made a fort of napkins and empty metal pitchers with a handwritten sign \"DO NOT TOUCH\" over the half-eaten pizookie plate. We laughed so much. The best customer service we've received anywhere in recent memory! Thank you, Dan!",

I was told they only serve specialty sangrias and that the bartender just couldn't make that drink for me. Only the drinks on the menu. What? Any bartender with a proper license and training should know how to throw together a simple sangria. If I could do it myself at home, how could a \"professional\" in a well stocked bar not be able to? I will try this location again but it won't be first on my list, that's for sure.",

    "text": "I wish Yelp had negative reviews. Last week, I was in a party of 8 including my husband and 2 year old. BJ's was running busy and we had to wait a good while for our table-about 30-40 min but it is what it is, I didn't mind that. We finally got to our table and waited about 20 minutes before a waiter showed up.  We placed drink orders and about 20 minutes later, someone comes and delivers drinks to 7 of the 8 people.  We finally track down someone to tell them we are missing a drink.  OK fine whatever.   So we place our food orders.We get the food for everyone but the pregnant lady (me) and the 2 year old. Just as with the drinks, NO ONE stops and even checks to see if we all have our food, it's literally dump and run with the waiters.  So I'm thinking surely it will come soon, and wait, and wait, along with a toddler who is getting ticked because he has no food.  Because I haven't seen our waiter in forever, I get up and go track him down where of course, he's clueless.  I tell him to cancel my order and I take my son and leave because at this point, everyone else has pretty much finished their food.  I understand busy, but at least check and make sure everyone at the table has their order!    I told a manager on the way out what had happened and he told me that how we were treated was unacceptable.  Well, duh.  So I took my hungry, grumpy 2 year old and left.   I have been here before and the service has always been so-so, but they just took a nosedive off a cliff for me here.",

The other times I've been here the food wasn't impressive either. Baked mac and cheese was bland as was the salad.   Getting the order right is also another challenge for this place. My brother had ordered salmon teriyaki, and they came out with shrimp teriyaki instead.  Service was lacking. The waiter I had barely ever came to our table.  When my mother came to meet up for dinner once i had finished taking a bite of my dry chicken, she asked me what specialties they had.. i believe i told her \"nothing.\"  So for someone like me who isn't really a picky eater, this says something about the place. I will take my money and enjoy it somewhere else.",

This time around I went because I was craving fish and chips, we saw BJs and decided to give them a try.  Service: We were seated in a timely matter, but after reading over the menu a few times and finally deciding, we still hadn't seen a person to take our drink orders.  Finally a young lady takes our drink and food orders and tell us she will find our server for us. What?? She wasn't our server?? Where the heck is our chick at?  Anyways, after a little bit more time our server comes out and asks, shyly, if we would like malt vinegar with our fish and chips....I say yes, and she goes.  With the way she spoke, I figured she was new and decided not to get worked up about it. She was a sweet girl and so was the other lady who helped us. I'm taking a star off for her not being around much after, and watching other people at her tables have to get up and grab silverware off of other tables and what not...  Food: I ordered a strawberry lemonade...and I think something went wrong...it didn't taste like anything...usually strawberry lemonades....have flavor. I think I may have made a mistake by asking if their lemonades are \"home made.\"   (..i hate being picky about lemonade....)  Fish and chips: Good. Not great. But I ate them. My fries were cold, but I still ate them... and even if I wanted to complain, my server wasn't around.  My friend ordered the pulled pork sandwich and he enjoyed it. I took a tiny bite and it tasted good.  Not old enough to drink so I can't review on the beers. Sorry kiddos.  I probably wouldn't go here again. It has a huge selection of good food, and could please a lot of people. Its not terrible, but not my cup of tea.",

I had the Tomato and Mozzarella salad with a Chicken and Pesto flat bread pizza.  I raved about it so much that my mom and I went the next day and split the same salad and pizza.  Then I continued to rave about it so my mom, husband and I went the day after that and tried the appetizer sampler....so good!  Then my mom raved to my dad so my parents, husband and I went to dinner there!  We all ordered separated dinner entrees.  Everyone really enjoyed their meal!  We've all been back for lunch and happy hour.  Their tomato bisque is to die for!  I haven't had anything bad here.  The beer is great and the servers are pleasant! I've never had to wait more than 10 minutes to get a table. It's a great \"go-to\" place if you're looking for an easy place to eat with tons of options.  I'm excited to try their brunch!  Without a doubt, I will be back!",

Appetizers are good, so many to choose from but I tend to get these artichoke bites that you can just pop right into your mouth. Come for lunch, it ranges from $6-10.",

This place is actually really nice during lunch time hours because their lunch menu is reasonably priced and there are a ton of selections.  When I was in high school, we used to go here before games and stuff and it was a good go-to because of all the selections.  The atmosphere is comfortable and the staff at both west side and henderson locations are always really helpful.  Food-wise, it's kind of like better than Denny's??

    "text": "Went for dinner on a Sunday night.  Friend had gift certificate, or I probably would not really go out of my way to visit a fun 90's style \"brewpub/eatery\".  We were seated promptly and the interior was cavernous, nice, and not overly loud, despite being nearly full.  Appetizers:  Our party ordered chicken wings for an appetizer.  Sauces were excellent and wings had good flavor.  The wings themselves were somehow undercooked.  The meat was done, but the skin wasn't crispy and the insides had too much fat.  Meals: 1 BJ's burger ordered rare & delivered... rare - good job.  Flavor was good but the burger could have used some additional toppings (or at least ask me \"do you need anything to adorn that plain-looking burger?\")  2 fish tacos - these were pretty good per the diners.  1 club sandwich - also good.    Drinks: Great selection of drinks and our party sampled the porter, a crisp apple cider, and the BJ's-brewed root beer, among other beverages.  Dessert: Pozzati.  Chocolate ice cream on a brownie-cookie served in a little pan warm.  Very good.  Not what we ordered, but tasty.  Service: got a trainee+trainer combo who did make some mistakes that were not caught by the trainer.  Drinks sat empty for long stretches of time while these two talked earnestly about 20 feet away, never glancing at their tables.  Also, wrong dessert was brought by rookie - o well, it was good!  I don't love the genre, so reviewer bias is admittedly costing this place part of a star just because it's another brewpub with an unfortunate name.  A full star is deducted because service should be twice as good with 2 servers.  Instead, it was only about half as good as it should have been.  Overall, not bad.",

It was topped with chicken and alfredo sauce.   Don't get me started on their pizookies! The white chocolate macadamia topped with vanilla ice cream is my favorite!  Service is usually hit or miss here. The last time I went, our server SUCKED. It took her forever to take our orders. My friend accidentally dropped a piece of food in his water and when he asked her for a new water, she just filled it up. It took us about 5 more mins to wave her down to tell her that he wanted a new water due to him dropping food in it. Then she just brings us our check without even asking if we wanted dessert. And of course we wanted dessert!   The food is great, but the service is just okay.",

She returned it for a pepsi.   Then my wife had ordered an appetizer salad. Our entrees were delivered, and no salad. The server realized she forgot the salad and told us she would bring it out and have the manager take it off our bill.   Then the server offered a refill on our friend's pepsi, and brought a diet pepsi.   Now I know why it's been almost a year since I've been to a BJ's, and why I'll most likely never go back.",

Took 10+ minutes to put an order in for a beer, asked if they could put the game on and by the time we'd finished our beer they still didn't make an effort to put the game on.

Even with the sauce added, now I only tasted salt.  My husbands salad looked as though the lettuce had been out for sometime, and somehow the chicken fingers did not pass my daughter's tastebuds.   Typically I have gotten a decent meal here. It could have been the night, but they were not that crowded. We were immediately seated.However I was surprised though that our server never asked if everything came out ok. I would have probably said something.   I'm sure I'll go back and try something different!",

I love that you can buy growlers of the beer to take home, and the root beer is really good as well.  It is great to take home and make your own root beer floats.  The service is usually really friendly, but at times it's been kind of slow.  I prefer to go and sit in the bar area during happy hour, where they have great drink and food specials.  There is something on the menu for everyone.  I love the small bites and the pizzas, especially during happy hour when they are half off (in the bar area).",

My girlfriend got some type of shrimp and asparagus bowl (I think) and a couple of hours later she was complaining about weird lower abdominal cramps. Fast forward a couple of more hours and shes throwing up all night long,here it is the next day at lunch and she is still puking her guts up. Sadly a couple of months prior I had the same problem when I took my parents there to eat at the same location. I woke up in the middle of the night and threw up for hours and hours. Called the next day to let the manager know and shes like oh this isn't food poisoning or bad food it takes around 24 hours for that to happen... me not knowing any better I just passed it off as a \"fluke\" and didn't waste anymore time on it. But now since the same exact thing happened to my girlfriend and after reading more reviews we definitely arent alone in our bad food experiences. Daughter got the kids spaghetti and it was basically noodles with what looked like a little bit of ketchup on top of it..a 7yo complained about how it was so plain and no flavor. I had the chicken Parmesan and the mashed potatoes were cold and the chicken was very chewy and had me worried again that I would get food poisoning like my prior visit so i didnt even eat half of it. This really is sad because BJS used to be one of my favorite spot, not anymore, not worth puking my guts up for hours/days",

I've been here several times, but my most recent visit was Saturday after the Spartan Race. We were a group of 6. We started with nachos, potato skins, and wings. Potato skins and wings were pretty good. The nachos were okay..  I was craving pizza so I got an individual 5 cheese pizza with pepperoni. Half of the pizza was good. The reason I say that is because the whole inner half was soggy. A complete mush, so I was only able to eat half.  Had a chocolate chip pazookie for dinner. Yum! Service was really good.",

He went in the back to check with the manager and came out less then a minute later with the same answer.

They garnish these with a big ol' celery stick, a pickled green bean, an olive and a picked pepper. Not bad. Could have used some MORE garnish like a pickle, a beef stick, a piece of cheese...

Ordered the Avacado Egg Rolls as an appetizer and found a \"Grown in California\" sticker in one of them. I guess we know where they get the Avacodos from...   I know there were 11 people so a lot to coordinate, but the meals did not come out together and some were cold so I think there was a bit of mis-timing in preparing them.",

We sat at the bar & we were greeted very quickly by the bartender .... we knew what we wanted & ordered right away.   I personally can't drink very much & they had a little 5oz. Beer that they sell too! It's so cute and the perfect amount for me. Got the blonde beer & it was delish.  Had to give a 4 star on this review because the pazookie cookie was not hot. Maybe they changed it or something but it used to come out hot to the point where u can't really touch the silver tin part, but the tin wasn't even very warm. That was the only thing a little disappointing since I took a friend to try the restaurant for the first time. Other than that great service! =]",

Lunch time is best for me because they know how important it is for people to get back to work so the service is very efficient and fast and to the point. Hardly any wait time and as soon as you are seated the server shows up. Hard to beat this as most other restaurants are a bit slower. My favorite food here is their pizza flatbread and their burgers are great as well. I really like the Henderson location as it is near several other businesses that I have to frequent especially my dentist office is also in that shopping center which I gladly drive all the way from Summerlin. I recently have started liking beer and wow these guys are great with their beers as well. Highly recommended.",

Food here is good, nice selection, and i enjoy the in house made beers, but just kind of got the impression my being there was an inconvenience to the server.

I chose the seared ahi salad off of their lunch menu. The salad was listed as having only 540 calories which made it very attractive in regards to being diet compliant. The salad was quite large in size. It had a lot of what I would call \"foo foo\" lettuce. But it also had avocado, tomato, and other tasty add ins ( including a small dollop of wasabi on each side of the plate). In addition there was a fairly generous amount ahi tuna. Overall, a relatively healthy, fairly dietetic, enjoyable luncheon salad. Combine that with pleasant ambience and excellent service (kudos to Shenna). A good choice for a midweek lunch.",

    "text": "Been here a handful of times and this review is way overdue! This place can get pretty crowded and busy at times. But you can't ding a restaurant just because of that... It means they're doing their job and running this place as it should!   I have never had a complaint about getting greeted every time I walk into BJ's. When it's busy, they give us an honest estimate as to how long we will wait. None of that \"10 minutes\" when they really mean 45 minutes!   Once we get seated our drink orders are taken almost instantly. We have quite some time to look over the menu, we never feel rushed. When you have no idea what to order waiters/waitresses are always recommending and suggesting things.   Food comes out hot and fresh. You never have to wait too long for your food. Approximately between 30-45 minutes, max! I appreciate the waiters tending to our needs and frequently checking up on us.   I never have complaints on cleanliness here. The waiting area, seating area, and bathrooms are always so clean! HUGE plus for me! Excellent customer service! Welcoming and accommodating staff. I would highly recommend this place!   Side note, if you don't know what to order I would suggest:  Appetizers- avocado egg rolls, stuffed mushrooms Main Dish- Cajun chicken pasta, (any flavor) deep dish pizza, or broccoli cheddar soup and/or clam chowder with a bread bowl Dessert- you can never go wrong with a pizookie! But definitely try the beignet!   Hope this helps!",

    "text": "Let me start by saying BJ's always has consistently good food and service. WARNING: DO NOT WEAR WHITE PANTS, WHEN YOU DINE HERE, OR AVOID PUTTING THEIR BLACK NAPKINS ON YOUR LAP !  On our recent visit, our meals were ok, but have a couple complaints.  My sister and I both ordered the BJ's burger and our server did get her toppings wrong, but no biggie.  They use a computerized ordering system, and I think he still hadn't mastered it yet.  When our burgers arrived they were on a tiny oval plate, and the burger and fries just barely fit, almost like they ran out of regular plates and decided to use kids meal plates. We asked about it and found out that was what they have started using, but noticed the table next to us had metal trays lined with paper for their burgers, which is what I've always had in the past. Maybe it's just the BJ's burger you get a kids plate, but there was not enough room to even put the ketchup for you fries on the side.  When we were leaving we noticed that our white capris we were wearing had black lint all over them from their black napkins.  If you plan on using black napkins, make sure they're lint free, or use white, which also should be lint free.   Since we don't usually carry a lint roller with us we needed to go back home, to de-lint ourselves before heading out to our next destination.  Yes, it was that bad !",

We ordered curbside to go b/c we wanted just an easy dinner. The curbside process was easy and fast which is the only reason for the extra star. However, the food last night was awful, and had I been dining in 2 of my 3 items ordered would have been sent back.  We started with the potato crisp appetizer (basically potato skins). These aren't hard to mess up, but they were so burnt they were not even edible. Literally, fried to a crisp and I couldn't even eat it. Trash, $10.15 out the door - overpriced to begin with now that I'm thinking of it.  My wife ordered sliders with cheese which we were charged $1.25 or something for cheese, which didn't get put on the burger. Since we paid already, nothing we can do. Stupid - I'm sure they do that on purpose to get more $ on to-go orders. Who's going to check for cheese in the car?  I had some shrimp taco thing which was bland as can be. Literally no flavor...so I mean it was the only non-messed up item in our order but yuck. I had asked for sauce on the side, they put it right on the tacos, so actually 3/3 items messed up. I should be giving a 1-star but the gal who helped w/curbside was very nice.  So many other places to eat - I said to my wife last night: OKAY - we're DONE with BJ's.",

    "text": "I was hungry and looking for a place to eat. I stopped by BJ's brewery. My first thought when I walked in was the beautiful decorations and the great music which stuck out to me a lot.   The waiters were really nice when I asked for a table for one. They then told me it was open seating. I sat down and looked through the menu, I noticed that there were many weekly specials and every day had a different special.  The waiter came up to me quite fast and I told him I wanted to order quickly. What I was going to order originally was going to run me about $40 but the nice waiter told me about the happy hour special going on and I ended up paying a lot less than what I was going to pay before! I'm so grateful for the happy hour tip cause the waiter didn't have to tell me that.  I ended up ordering the beef sliders, the avocado eggrolls, and the burger with fries. I finished off with a pazookie for dessert.  While I was waiting for my food I was enticed by the high-quality televisions around the bar area, I could  watch any game from where I was sitting and everything was clear and one one my teams were playing.   My appetizer and my entree both came out at the same time. I would have preferred the appetizer come first but with the money I saved, I wasn't complaining.   I started off by eating the beef sliders which was made with a sweet bun, a small patty, pickles, lettuce, ketchup, and mustard. The sliders came in four individual pairs and I ate all four of them. They were really good and actually tasted better than the burger itself.  Next, I ate the avocado eggrolls. These are the best eggrolls I've ever had in my life. They come with avocados and different sauces inside of it, mixed with spices, and it is worth how much I paid for them! Anytime I come back to BJ's I will definitely get these egg rolls as my appetizer.  I finished off my entree with the burger, the burger was delicious. Medium well! It came with a bun, beef patties, tomatoes, ketchup, and mustard. I was disappointed that it didn't come with cheese, but maybe I should've asked.  My only problem was the french fries, it was kind of dry, being that I go to bjs a lot. They have really good fries.   I ended off my experience with the delicious chocolate chip pazookies. Since it was Tuesday,  it was going for only three dollars. Definitely it was a must get.  I really enjoyed my experience at BJ's, from the great customer service, the delicious food, calm environment, and the affordable prices! I'll definitely be back.",

The food was bland, room temperature, and just completely unsatisfactory. That was my last time visiting BJ's for the foreseeable future.

I arrived at the restaurant and the girl at the to go counter says my order was not received. She states this has been a problem in the past. Ok no worries things happen. She notified her manager what happened so she took my order at the counter, I said I inputted a promo code for free appetizer. She goes in the back and manager comes out saying she can not honor the free appetizer because I can not receive two promo codes on the same order (pizzas half off).  I told manager online ordering allowed me to place the order with all promotions. The girl at the counter asked if I still wanted the appetizer I said \"no\". I asked her the price without the appetizer. I was not pleased so I said \"I do not want any of it\" and proceeded to walk out of the restaurant.   I arrived at my car to call my wife to inform her of what happened. I received a notification email from bjs that my order was placed. I was thinking this is so weird. I went back into the restaurant to show the confirmation email, but manager told girl at counter she can not honor it because two promo codes can not be combined on one order. I am confused because I showed the confirmation email.   I did not pay, I chose pay at restaurant. I asked the girl so do I just disregard this? She said \" my manager says yes\". Poor girl she is just the messenger, her manager put her in an awkward situation. I do not know why the manager did not come talk to me. So for future orders,  (if any) confirmation emails are not valid? Is it up to management discretion to accept orders. I am so confused. I hope someone can elaborate more on this.",

I stay with the burgers, salmon, salads, and pasta.  They are all well prepared and tasty.     The service can be a little slow but the environment is pleasing so you don't really mind.  Lots of woods, faux leather and high ceilings.   It is a very comfortable place to just socialize and relax.  BJs is decent value and I enjoy my visits here.",

Their house brewed beer is generally pretty good, especially their stout.. a strong at 8.5% but surprisingly smooth.  Go on Wednesday's  and you can get a pint for $4!  (all their house beer is $4 on Wed).   The service is very good too.  Our regular waiter Dan takes care of us very well.  They also have 'beer dinners' every couple months that are fun.  Each one has a different theme and they pair beers with a 5 course meal (all you can drink).  Overall a great spot, highly recommended!",

It was also nice to find out that they weren't going to charge a cover to watch the game here. We accidentally went to Twin Peaks next door first and they were charging $20/person even for the kids! Forget that!   Here, It has a nice atmosphere for a casual sit-down lunch or dinner or even a nice vibe for a birthday celebration.  We ordered a lot of food and everything was good...  Calamari (appetizer) - good portion size, yummy marinara and aioli dipping sauces, good batter Chips w/ Guacamole Dip (appetizer) - just okay and similar to other house-style chips  Fish and Chips - fresh and crunchy battered fish  Margarita Flatbread Pizza - just okay  Kids Menu - super good value...about $6.00 for a drink and one of the options listed, my nephews ordered the cheese deep dish pizza and cheeseburger and fries Clam Chowder - creamy and lots of clams but not too much other visible ingredients like onion, celery, carrot, etc. but it was still tasty!  Overall good experience! I wish we had a location in Hawaii! Much better than some other chain restaurants we have like Outback Steakhouse.",

I like the clam chowder so much I feel like I'm missing out if I try anything else.  With that said, I have tried a burger and a pizza here.  Both were pretty good if my memory serves me.  The clam chowder in a sourdough bowl.   Its good clam chowder; thick without being too thick.  The best part is the bread bowl though.  They butter the hell out of the \"lid\" and toast it.  It's amazing.  The bread is flakey on the outside and soft on the inside.  The service is about average but they do seem to get overwhelmed during happy hour times.",

We didn't get the extra sides of ranch and marina we had asked for either (we probably would have if our server had written down our order).

My lady friend and i went here especially for pizookie day .ordered appetizers stuff mushrooms calamari and some kind of new hot wings she ordered ... She says her wings were bland and didnt have enough rub on them they brought more rub thee calamari was bland as well even drizzles of lemon juice did not help or assist . No problem mushrooms were fine ..... So now we're awaiting our main course which we both decided on jambalaya , to our surprise both our meals came mines with extra chicken but missing shrimps on both . So waiter gets manager which i believe his name was ,kevin, !he comes out and tries to sooth us and to make things better , i guess he had thee kitchen prepare our shrimp which came out 5 minutes  later on the side so now we have to toss our shrimp in our meal . At tht time we were kinda done with this establishment so we ask for to go boxes and our dessert  , where the waiter informed us we could only get one pizookie per table which prompts me to look at the flyer ..... Which states with a purchase of 9.95 u get a pizookie no where on it does it state one per table i mean did yawl want us to split our party up and sit at the bar to make more of a mess to clean i suppose .at the ens of the day we got 2 but the experience at this location is not worth me coming back all bjs are already miles away from me but i think ill stick with thee one on charleston instead i mean on a 70 dollar bill didnt get  a appetizer taken off are anything like seriously bring my shrimp on the side and think that would make thee issue better i seriously doubt it",

I had the barbacoa tacos which consist of three super small tacos filled very conservatively and a side of black beans. Flavor was moderate. My GF had the fish tacos which looked normal size and pretty delicious. Sadly the appearance didn't match the taste. When I had a bite it tasted like a frozen fish stick stuck inside of a bland tortilla. Our other friend had the dinner jambalaya and they thought it was really tasty. We had the pizookie trio for dessert and it as always was awesome.   As for the service, started off ok but ended pretty bad. We were waiting for our refills and thought it was taking a bit long when we noticed that our waiter was standing back in the servers holding a conversation with his friend. Luckily another waitress came by and pretty much took over our table until he finished his conversation.   From what I can tell this is the type of place where it's best just to eat off their dinner menu no matter what. I thought lunch menu meant same quality smaller portions but apparently it means smaller portions and no quality. As for the service I still think there will always be a few bad apples no matter where you go and it seems that I just have bud luck at this location.   Probably going to drive across town next time and see if I can better service and order my delicious buffalo chicken pizza and rootbeer.",

The 8 beer sampler totaled 40oz.  Not bad for a sampler!  And only about $12.xx to boot!  Beers were of your more obscure, microbrewery variety and all sooo good.  Got a diverse range of flavors and colors of beer.  Not knowing what to eat (menu is quite extensive), we chose the thai chicken wonton based on its picture in the menu.  Tapa sized portions which worked out fine since I didn't want to get stuffed off an appetizer.  The wonton texture was crispy and flaky.  The accompanying thai sauce was a bit strong on the fish sauce--use in moderation.  Good consistency of sauce--don't like watery sauce softening the wrappings of my wontons...  It was good, but I wouldn't make a strong recommendation on it.  If you are in the mood for this, then order; otherwise, not a must have.  My buddy ordered the deep dish pizza.  Not sure what was the name of the specialty pizza but he ordered the meaty version.  He liked it, but I'm a pickier eater.  I thought the pizza lacked flavor as if it needed salt which is quite surprising since meat on pizza is usually salty by nature.  Not so with this pizza.  was the meat boiled prior and the saltiness leached off?  idk....  Lots of cheese but nary of tomato sauce.  Need a better balance with sauce and cheese...    Bartender Emily's favorite dish at BJ's is their jambalaya.  With so many attractive entrees in their picture menu, I had a difficult time selecting my entree.  Warily, I went with Emily's recommendation and got the jambalaya.  Thank you, Emily, for your suggestion!  I rarely eat jambalaya so don't have a frame of reference to compare against, but this passed the taste test.  Unless you have an aversion to cajun spice, I think you will enjoy this dish.  Tried the Pizookie for dessert.  Hot, large & thick cookie topped a la mode with ice cream.  The contrast of the cold ice cream on the freshly baked cookie is a winning combo!  To recap, mixed reviews on their deep dish pizza, but the jambalaya, 8 beer sampler, and pizookie are winners!  Ohh, and Emily is a hottie!  With dozen's of locations throughout the US, BJ's could be a good spot to fall back on for a cheap-to-moderately priced meal..",

In the past I've ordered a Patty melt with no problem. Today due to the new system it was not an option. I've ordered regular nachos as well...again not so able. My sister complained to the manager who was able to by pass the new computer system. While waiting for the food, runners came to the table with the wrong food. The runner apologized stating he read the ticket wrong. The waitresses seemed frustrated because the system is sub par. The food came with sides that were not requested. My wife ordered Chicken Parm with broccoli but instead got mash potatoes. The main meal came prior to the appetizer. The food tasted fair! Aside from the system and few hic-ups...not bad",

The burger was pretty standard and was kind of bland in regards to the Patty, but the bacon and cheese gave it some taste. Had the Brussel sprouts as an app which saved the meal as they were crisp and charred up perfectly. I had the house made root beer and that was super tasty as well so make sure and order one if your a soda fan. Service was great as was the ambiance of this joint. I will come back if just in the mood for apps and drinks.",

I was meeting my OG Ryan B for lunch and I remember seeing a coupon for a large any style pizza so we couldn't resist.   We came around 12:45 and it was packed. We were seated in the bar area on a high top table and were greeted relatively quickly by our server and gave her our coupon and put our order in for a large five meat deep dish. They were a little slow getting our drinks and refills were a little hard to come by at first, as we had to remind her a few times for drinks. We also had to remind them that we needed silverware, sugar for my tea as well as red pepper flakes for our pizza. Service was friendly however and I cut them slack for being so busy.   As far as our pizza goes, it wasn't great. Not as hot and cheesy as I was hoping. Maybe a few more minutes in the oven would have added a crispiness that was needed. I definitely wouldn't have been happy about paying full price for the meal, but at half off it was ok. They took our coupon without problem and even gave us a free mini pizookie with our offer. This was my first time trying a pizookie and I wasn't blown away, but for free I was quite happy with it nonetheless.   I won't be back without a coupon, but at a discount this place will do in a pinch and I do enjoy their beer selection quite a bit.",

    "text": "This review is for 3.5 stars.  Overall, I enjoyed my trip to BJ's.  I came for the brew but also tried some food which was solid.  Their beer is surprisingly unique and flavorful for a chain microbrewery.  I had the 4 beer sampler for a little under $7 and also was able to sample other brews because the bartender was gracious.  All of the ales (pale, IPA, DIPA) were nice and a less hoppy variant of the style.  The Porter had a solid chocolate taste and the imperial stout was very smooth for the 8+ ABV.  As far as food, I had a quinoa salad which was not overly memorable, but was good enough for a meal.    There are 3 BJ's within the Las Vegas area, so wherever you are in town, you are bound to be near one.  If you are looking for a solid, not macro brew, come here.  They also offer very good guest taps and bottles for very reasonable prices ($5-6.50) when it comes to Las Vegas.  The Happy Hour for beer is $1.00 off draft and there are also some food deals.  I recommend you give BJ's a try.",

I came in to pick up an order around 11:30 that was said to be ready by 11:35. When I arrived, I was told I would have to wait an additional 15min, which I did. I then proceeded to wait another 10min until I was told my order was ready. I spoke with the Manager trying to explain to her that the 25min delay could very well cost me my tip and possibly a bad rating. She then proceeded to tell me how they we're backed up and there isn't much they could do and that the restaurant would be taking the bad rating.. NO, no, no.. What she doesn't comprehend is that, I, the driver.. take the bad rating. You work for a commercial restaurant. And backed-up?! They only had (4) orders at that particular time. She, the manager, even said so.  She then has a look on her face like she is upset that I'm even bringing this up. If you don't have the staff or proper organization to handle a few orders within a reasonable amount of time then its obvious you cannot do your job. Plain and simple. Further more this isn't the first time. I have had this issue (6) times with this particular restaurant located on Eastern.",

The whole interaction was so intense I should have just left right then & there. I'm a very sweet & kind person to everyone. I was so intimidated by her. She told us how long it would be & so we sat to wait. Every person who came in she gave the same terrible customer service to. This is the first person you see when you come into the restaurant, they should be the warmest & most welcoming. When we told our server that the hostess was rude & asked her name she said she didn't know her name. Nothing else was done about it.

For a party of 4, we shared 2 salads (the ahi tuna and the kale brussels sprouts) and one large veggie deep dish pizza, which was half off per the Monday night special. It was just the right amount of food.   The salads were fresh and the deep dish pizza was decent at half price. I would have been disappointed if I had to pay full price for it, as the pizza wasn't truly deep dish (more like deep dough) and the toppings were quite sparse.",

However the quality of the food was below average for us. Soup and steak did not come out warm and lacked taste. My prime rib was not cooked as requested.   I think the generous portions make it a good value but the quality and taste is not quite where i would expect it to be. Overall good price and busy place to eat.",

When I order, I just point out the picture to my server when I dine in. I'm not really familiar with the dishes name sometimes. Being on the phone, Maleah was able to do a quick thorough run down on the menu. She was very patient with me and recommended me different things that I maybe interested in.

What I loved about her is that she new everything on the menu and was able to explain items and make changes for us on some dishes !

Tiffany far exceeded our expectations. She allowed us to feel comfortable during the hustle and bustle of rush hour dinner while my husband and I engaged in assisting our three children with their nightly homework activities while enjoying a delicious family meal. Tiffany brought such love, respect, kindness, and professionalism to our evening it could not be overlooked. Mahalo, Tiffany, we will see you soon",

When someone finally came out they told me that it would be just a few more minutes for my order to be ready because the chef messed up on the pizookie. I was okay with waiting a couple extra minutes for a normal looking one. I get home and I don't know how much worse it could have looked from the first one.

Upon entering the restaurant we were greeted by a friendly hostess who led us to a nice booth by the window. We were handed menus and our waitress came over and took our drink order. Our drinks were brought out rather quickly and our waitress was patient as we decided what to order.  My son whom has autism asked if he could have his spaghetti without meatballs with only meat sauce. Our waitress was kind and she made a request in the kitchen for my son's spaghetti to be made with meat sauce, no meatballs.  My husband and I ordered the Thursday special of half a rack of baby back ribs that came with two sides. I chose the Caesar salad and rice pilaf and my husband chose the clam chowder and baked potato. Another son ordered the turkey French dip with fries and coleslaw. My daughter ordered a gluten free pizza with pepperoni, black olives, mushrooms and white onions. Our baby back ribs special also came with a dessert. My husband chose a brownie pazookie. I ordered a gluten free chocolate chip pazookie for my daughter and my son ordered vanilla ice cream. All of our meals were delivered hot, fresh and expertly prepared. Everything was delicious! you won't go away hungry! They feed you here! The customer service was outstanding. We definitely will return in the future.",

I wouldn't really recommend this time because it gets super busy. They do have a second happy hour time after 10pm- this happy hour sesh isn't that busy, so come on in!   * Our server Holly was sweet - if you come in request to sit in her section! She's super personable and has a fun personality.   *The happy hour menu is legit; I ordered two jamo/diets for only $5 each, say what?! Yup! You read that right! Pours? Good. Drinks? Stiff. Me like!   *We munched on some avocado rolls which were quite tasty. For about 6 rolls, you'll pay about $6, happy hour price. This are filling, and go well with a couple alchie bevies.   I would totally return to BJ's to try other stuff on their huge menu. Not only do they have pizza, but they also have pasta dishes, burgers and more.  P.s. BJ's has a ton of TVs throughout - which is a great place to watch the NBA finals! (Go Warriors!)",

Today when we walked in the manager, Jamie, happened to be at the entrance. She immediately said hello to us and gave us a hug. This truly makes you feel welcomed and appreciated as a customer and this is the type of experience we have had here.   BJ's food and service has been consistently good and they offer many specials during the week. I also signed up for their app which has many cool features. First off you can pay directly from the app so no waiting for a bill if your in a hurry. You also can add yourself to a priority waitlist if you are coming during a busy time or order food to go. They also have a rewards program where you get $10 credit for every $100 you spend so its definitely worth getting the app!   The lunch specials range from around $7-11 depending on what you get and some include soup or salad. I tried the new Mediterranean chicken pita tacos today and they were really good. Now is a great time to try BJs if you haven't been. They have $3 pizookies through the end of October and 20% off your bill when you pay with the mobile app.",

    "text": "OMG! Stay away! This has been the worse 24 hours I've ever had and currently writing this in bed sick.  About 10min. after the meal, I burped, and had throw up come out my nose and mouth. As the night progressed, my stomach sounds like a howling dog and to spare you the details, let's just say it's coming out two ends. I've been violently throwing up all night and also for \"the other reason\" scared to sleep incase I have an accident. I seriously can't believe Im writing this, but if it saves one person the misery, myself and fiance are experiencing, than it did its job. If only I could upload a video of my stomach sounds so you can hear how crazy it. So you might ask, what did I order that fueled this vicious ramification and how was the service?  It started off with our beverages. I had a water and my fiance had a sprite. The sprite tasted off like it was missing the syrup, and it was. The waitress took the beverage and offered to replace it, however it never came back until mid meal. My fiance had asked the food runner gave me my soup for water, but that took even longer. So I ate my cup of soup, and my fiance I shared some of my soup and our one cup of water. Next our meals came out. I got the turkey dip and my fiance had the BJ's burger that apparently you can only order medium well and extra well done. (Sayyyy what what a sin! I'm guessing someone must have gotten sick from that too, so it need to be extra cooked???). He had asked for ranch during his order and as he asked for ketchup for his fries and ranch, the lady just scurried away before he could say the rest of his sentence. I had a 1/2 of 1/2 of the sandwich and called it a night. Mid-meal, my fiance finally got his sprite and then the water he ordered as he was gnawing on his burnt burger that tasted like chalk. Overall from food quality and customer service, I'd just avoid this place. I'll never come back, you couldn't pay me. Go to Red Robin next door, that's always a safe bet with better food.",

It isnt expensive per-se. But I wouldnt pay their regular bar prices.  My favorite dish is their grilled chicken pasta. I am not a HUGE pasta fan, but I love this. I also really like their Pazookies (specifically the oreo)  The place is a good size, good amount of TVs (for the sports fans), and a good place for birthday parties and such.   I havent had a problem with staff, and they are usually pretty nice. Nothing really that separates them from other bars I have been to (other than the pazookie), but I wouldnt drive out of my way for it",

Tasty mac and cheese, good ceasar salad, calamari was crisp and their orange juice was freshly squeezed and sweet. Their avacado rolls had too much eggroll wrap though so they were chewy and skin uncooked instead of crispy like they make them at cheesecake factory so we didnt bother to finish them.",

When we arrived I asked for an allergy menu.  It was super easy to use.  We ordered a gluten free pizza with mozzarella cheese (not the normal 5 cheese blend because my son can't have aged cheeses like cheddar).  The manager, Joe, came out shortly after to let us know they didn't have shredded mozzarella but 'pearl mozzarella balls' and asked if that would be alright.  We were just so happy they could accommodate us we didn't care.  Pizza came out and my tiny eater ate almost the entire thing!  Joe came back to check on us to make sure everything turned out ok.  We were so appreciative of the personalized treatment.  Our server was also fantastic as she was peppered with questions by us about everything.  I'm so sorry I forgot your name to give you proper credit.  Of course, the rest of our food was great and my other two boys devoured all their food as well.  Thank you so much BJs!!!",

    "text": "BJ's has a nice open layout and a good atmosphere, especially if you like sports. There's many TV's around and a bar area where there's a big variety of beers and drinks.  As I don't drink, smoke or like sports I won't comment on these.  I decided to try BJ's for their deep dish pizza which is advertised as Chicago style and has received positive praise so far.  The appetizers were quite good and not very heavy.  The pizza reminded me of Uno's, though not quite as good: It wasn't real Chicago style in that the crust was relatively thick. It was more Pizza Hut pan pizza than Chicago style.   The sauce was not on top as per Chicago tradition but it tasted great, as tangy as it should be. The other ingredients tasted fresh also. The crust was relatively generic, it was baked pretty good and was crispy on the outside but didn't much taste and was too thick to be True Chicago style. Greasiness factor was slightly above average. A small pizza can easily feed 1 person with a big appetite.  So for the pizza,  As Chicago style: 2/5. As \"generic deep dish pan pizza\" Pizza Hut style: 5/5   (much better than Pizza Hut's)  Service was just adequate. Servers weren't really attentive, they catered mostly to the people at the bar and only visited my table once after they served our order.  When I went to BJ's I wasn't aware of any big game on the TV but the people at the table next to me were shouting and cursing when they got excited (as did 2 other tables plus plenty of people in the bar area) every 3 minutes or so. I'm not a sports fan so I don't care about sports events but it appears this place is more of sports bar than a restaurant. Prepare to be annoyed by noises and shouting.  Overall I'd give this 2.5/5 (rounded to 3 because the pizza was good, not Chicago style though).",

My boyfriend and I were running errands in the area and have passed by this restaurant multiple times and always talked about wanting to try it out. We figured it was happy hour, so why not. We decided to sit in the bar area and to my surprise there were children running in between the tables and chairs! First off, I don't see how some parents let their children run around like crazy in a restaurant. Second off, are they even allowed in the bar area? Anyway, we put our food and drink orders in. We ordered the crispy calamari, avocado egg rolls, chicken lettuce wraps, and boneless wings. We watched the soccer game while we waited (Russia vs Korea). They have a nice huge tv screen right above the bar, so seems like a good place to watch sports. We were both really hungry and ended up waiting OVER 30 minutes for anything to come to our table. Really? Over half an hour for food that are considered appetizers? Thank goodness we didn't order any entrees because who knows how long that would've taken. Of the four dishes we ordered, the avocado egg rolls were the only thing that really stuck to me. Everything else was okay. We moved onto dessert, my favorite part of any meal. We decided to go with the peach and candied pecan cobbler, which was very delicious, but ended up waiting another 20 minutes. Overall, it was just okay. Will I come back? Probably only for the avocado egg rolls and cobbler.",

    "text": "Couldn't wait to try this location for the last several months since we moved over here. We won't be back. Walked into the restaurant around 9 PM (they don't close until midnight) to nobody on stand. After a few minutes, a host grabbed 2 menus & just sat us without saying anything. Our waitress seemed nice, took our order & the food came out about 20 min later. I didn't get the side of ranch I ordered, so I had to flag her down & didn't get it until my fries were cold. We also didn't get any silverware/napkins, so we had to flag her down again & then she brought ONE. She then came back about a minute later (after I took about 2 bites of my meal) & asked if we wanted dessert. I told her that we weren't sure since we just got our food. We didn't see her the rest of the time. Another waitress had to fill up my husbands water after he didn't have anything to drink for his whole meal. The different waitress then asked what we wanted for dessert & she seemed annoyed when I asked for a menu because we didn't know what there was. I'm shocked that the service was this horrible. The summerlin restaurant was PACKED (there was maybe 2-3 tables per waitress/waiter at this henderson one) & our service was way better at Summerlin. We were kind & didn't ask for much, so one star is all I can muster up for a $35 pasta & burger with all we dealt with. One star goes to the food that was actually really good. It's a shame that this is only a few minutes away, but we will go the distance so we don't leave angry again. It's not that hard to just be at least kind of nice & actually service basic needs when that's your job. Not sure what everyone's deal is here...they're all snoody or annoyed & it makes a horrible experience.",

I love the balance of flavor although I'd recommend that you don't feed it to some kids as there taste buds are still developing which might make them not like but yet it's a good why for them to try something new.

There are enough pizza options to make you think you're eating at a pizza joint, and enough burger options to make you feel like they hate chick fil a.  Either way, its a good call.  If you enjoy an adult beverage, their beer selection is large, and if you cannot decide they will offer shot glass samplers to whet your palate.  The service was efficient and friendly.  On a side note they also make their own root beer which you can view in a large vat in the back of the restaurant.  Just a little fun fact.

I told my server about my sandwich being very cold ( not even room temp) and he took it back. Ten minutes later he brought me another sandwich which wasn't even warm, crazy how bad the preparation and food quality has gotten here.

The tavern pizza was a joke. 15.00 for a so called 12 cut pizza ya righ. It was nothing more than a flatbread pizza with a higher price. We asked the servicer if she made a mistake and ordered the flatbread she said she didn't. She sent the manager to ask about our concerns. When he got there it was with an attitude and wanted to argue that we were wrong and asked why we didn't complain when it got there we ju said fine and asked him to leave.

The manager (Jamie) insisted that we had contracted for 30. That would have been fine--adjust us down to 30 and we are good right? Well, Jamie insisted on accusing our guests that had dined separately on their own checks of potentially eating at the buffet we were paying for. Not only that but she became unbelievably rude. I would avoid this place at all costs. It's located in a center with many restaurants that are happy to have your business. Go to them instead of this BJ's. At least they are named correctly--because this place blows!",

    "text": "A group of us decided to dine at BJs on Dec. 3rd.  We get the little buzzer for when your table is ready, and we sit down.  First, there was another diner that was sitting on the bench in the \"waiting\" area breastfeeding her baby.  Why the restaurant would allow this - I have no idea.  But anyhow, we wait for our buzzer to buzz, and low and behold after 15 minutes it's buzzing.  We go up to the front, they get our menus ready and ask us to stand off to the side.  We stand off to the side... for 30 minutes.  The hostess tells us literally about 10 times that our table is being cleaned.  So why ring the buzzer if it wasn't ready the first time?   Finally, the hostess takes us out back to our table, and the table is still dirty!  What in the world??  So we stand there as she grabs a busser to clean the table.  Then we get seated on a wet table.  Our waitress comes after a few minutes, and she has this matter-of-fact attitude and doesn't even apologize for the mishap which she clearly knew about because she was talking to the hostess who was telling her about it.  But anyway, we order our drinks.  She comes back and gives everyone the wrong drinks.  Everyone on the table just starts handing out the appropriate drinks to the appropriate people on the table.    We order our food and wait almost another half an hour for our entrees.  The chili was absurdly salty, and it had an alcohol taste to it.  Completely inedible.  We tell this to the waitress, and she apologizes but does nothing about it.  At this point, we conduct ourselves by the dining golden rule to not anger your waitress.  We say nothing further.    I ordered a 12oz steak - medium.  This was the smallest most overcooked steak I have ever had.  It was 6oz at the most.  It was unbelievable.  Underseasoned and lacking from any flavor.  I ask the waitress for steak sauce, and she brings it by and just drops it on the table without even looking my way.    When we were done with our meal, she comes by and tells us \"if you want desert, you can have red velvet pazookie. It's good.\"  That's it?  No menu, no other choices?   We pay our bill and leave.  The quality and service was abysmal at this BJs.  You're better off going to the one in Centennial or Summerlin.",

I don't buy any product with an unknown price until you see the bill. Warm Root Beer in a chilled glass doesn't make for a cold Root Beer on a hot day, it's still warm. Pizza was good, but can do much better food for less price elsewhere. Lots of wait staff running around, not busy, but not very good attention to us at the tables. Slow to acknowledge the table and in a hurry to leave it when you try to order. Never mentioned any specials that I hear they always have. Another typical young crowd hangout who don't care about experience and quality. Too many other choices around to frequent this place. No more for me.",

    "text": "I've been to BJ's restaurants in Eugene and San Diego and this is far and away the best.  It's casual dining but in a very nice setting.  This BJ's is new to the area (border of Vegas and Henderson in Silverado Ranch) and has a split level dining hall.  The upper level has the bar which has a bitchin' hd video screen tuned to all kinds of sports including the glorious MLB Network.  Service is friendly and the staff is well educated on the huge menu.  Seriously, you'll really find just about anything when it comes to standard American food.  There's also a huge beer list of domestics, imports and special brews exclusive to BJ's.  Here's my gluttonous rundown:  Oktoberfest beer: I was talked into starting off with the limited edition house beer called Oktoberfest.  Good choice.  Tomato basil soup: fresh and warm topped with bread pieces.  Tasty and simple.  Fettucini Alfredo with Blackened Chicken: This entree off the lunch menu was the low point.  The pasta was undercooked and a little tough.  Garlic bread was too hard.  At least the chicken was cooked well.  Peanut Butter Piezookie:  Im not a religious man but if there's a heaven, this must be what they serve.  Freshly baked peanut butter cookie topped with two big scoops of vanilla ice cream.  Death row inmates should request this for a last meal.  Go to BJ's for this item alone and you'll leave happy.  The service was very good.  Maybe a little too good.  There could have been a few less \"how is everything?\" moments in mid-bite.  Maybe they thought I was a critic or something since I took pics of everything. I will hand it to my server who followed me to the parking lot with the keys I forgot at my table.  I will definitely be back.  This review would be five stars if not for the issues with my entree.",

    "text": "Sometimes it is difficult being gluten-free. I'm not talking about being gluten free to jump on the new diet fad bandwagon; I'm talking about having to eat gluten free or suffering the nauseous, gut wrenching pain of gluten poisoning. So when I had to leave Chicago, which has a plethora of gluten free establishments, to live in Las Vegas I was nervous that I wouldn't have many options that didn't completely empty my wallet and bank account each week.  Thankfully, I have found BJ's.   I don't know about the rest of their menu, but I've eaten off their gluten free menu and I will continue to do so for a very long time.   Do I eat healthy? Sure. Do I workout? Absolutely, 6 times a week or more. Does a girl have to start off the meal with a bowl of luscious, cream filled tomato bisque that makes my veins fight to keep unblocked? Yes. Does a girl have to eat some pizza with melty, oozy mozzarella cheese, Italian Sausage, garlic and fresh basil once a month? Darn tootin'. Does a girl have to finish the above meal with a GLUTEN FREE CHOCOLATE CHIP PIZOOKIE?!? ABSO-FREAKING-LUTELY!!!  Oh that tomato bisque. You creamy souptastic gluten free deliciousness. Your high fat and calorie content would normally make a health nut like me cringe and hide under a table. However, when you come to the table, lightly garnished with parsley, smelling like Mom's tomato soup when I was a kid, I must devour every last bite. I did today. I almost stabbed my fiance with a spoon to get the last drop.  You have to understand that there are some restaurants (*cough* Aurelio's *cough*) that seem to think that gluten free means that either we don't really like food or that we don't know what real food should taste like. Some gluten free pizzas have this bland, eerily flaky, bulky pizza crust that can barely brown when cooked let alone withstand pizza sauce, cheese and other ingredients (see above coughing spasm). BJ's makes this amazing thin crust pizza that is perfectly thin, crispy and has garlic and herbs infused in the crust to make me remember why pizza makes my heart sing every time I ate it back in Chicago. The Italian sausage was not as good as Chicago, but it still hit the spot, especially when they drowned the pizza with deliciously melted mozzarella cheese with roasted garlic. As I ate it I forgot that I was gluten free and simply enjoyed my food. Pure comfort.  I could go on for pages about that freaking pizookie. You guys, it is a deep dish chocolate chip cookie with ice cream on top. When I say ice cream I really should clarify one thing. By the time it gets to the table it isn't completely ice cream anymore because that warm, gooey, rich and downright sinful gluten free cookie melts that simple ice cream and makes dessert something that will haunt me whenever I go to the gym (which is right down the street).  One thing: I can't wait for their gluten free menu to grow. Right now they have some soups, salads, pizza and giant stuffed baked potatoes. Don't forget that pizookie too! Maybe some flatbread, hamburgers and a couple other entrees other than a balsamic chicken would be FANTASTIC!!!  Service was great. Water never went empty for more than one second, very friendly, patient and knew his gluten free items. His service was flawless, and I could not have felt more comfortable eating there as someone with a major allergy. If I wasn't suffering from a food coma I would go find his name off the receipt, but right now laying in bed with a round, full tummy seems like the perfect way to enjoy the rest of this meal.",

Food was tasty and good proportions. Not over the top.  Good craft beer selection on menu with accurate descriptions of what they taste like and food pairings to go with.  Very impressed that the manager came over at the end to congratulate my Daughter for her achievement at school and gave her a pin.

He's outstanding - he ran his backside off for everyone he waited on.  He even noticed when the server delivered the wrong order to the table, he made it right even though we told him it wasn't necessary.  WOW!!  When I complimented him on his EXCELLENT service, he told us we could ask for him the next time we come in.  I recommend everyone do the same, you will NOT be disappointed.  That said, tip him well, all waiters/waitresses depend on it!!!",

That being said not all the servers are bad w4eve maybe had 2 that were awesome. But the hosts are rude and dont seem to care when you walk in the door. The plates, silverware,  and glassware is DISGUSTING.  I once found some nasty gooey something in my water and when we told the server her response was ill come back for it later, so my advice to you bring your own water/ drink. Check your silverware before eating with it. And lastly make sure you dont have hair in your food because i found a nice long one in the caprese app. Proceed with caution.",

It was a hassle that we had to go back to get my vegetarian pizza, but at least they upgraded it to a small without charging. My friend got to keep the second BJ's Favorite mini, too. My only disappointment was that the hostess/cashier claimed that she checked the pizzas to make sure they were the correct ones, but the meat was quite OBVIOUS and couldn't be mistaken. We are human and everyone makes mistakes, but please do not lie to me. Especially to my face.  Well... I do not hold grudges, so 4 stars!  :)",

    "text": "It has been a while since I have been here. I remember fond memories of this place, but this time around, I am beginning to wonder why. On several occasions I was told to go for the happy hour because they are suppose to be one of the best.   With a dollar discount off of appetizers, I cannot say I am too impressed. Alcohol is not that cheap either; beers range around five dollars, dollar off of certain mixed drinks, and $4.25 for well drinks. I can think of many places that offer  better deals.   We started with a platter of potato skins, which were made perfectly. They were golden brown and remand crunchy even as we slowly ate them throughout the two hours we sat there. The sampler seared ahi is just that, a small taste, so do not expect a lot.    The real savings is if you decide to do the individual pizzas because they are half off. The pleasant memories of this deep dish pie is nothing close to the past. I got the BBQ chicken pizza. The crust was mediocre. It had a crisp edge, but the center was too doughy.  I usually can tolerate Chicago style. but the lack of sauce and dryness of the chicken made everything difficult to get down.   My friends ordered the mac & cheese, a bacon cheeseburger, and a chili cheeseburger. They were all satisfied with their orders. The chili cheeseburger took ten minutes longer than everything else. We were shocked by how many people apologized for the delay and the manager even stopped by to tell us that the burger would be comp. Even though we didn't think too much about it, this gesture was really impressive. As one friend recounted her disappointment with the pizza the last time she came, I should have took it as a hint to not order it and go with something else.   We ended our dining experience with a chocolate chip pazookie. The cookie was a bit on the raw side, but I didn't mind it. Eating cookie dough was always a bad habit I had as a child. With two heaping scoops of ice cream, it disappeared fast.",

    "text": "Let me start off by saying that we have come to this location for many years, but this time was our last. The experience here has slowly declined over time. Our previous two visits were an insult to the restaurant business. I, myself, am a server and therefore understand when certain circumstances arise that problems may happen. That being said, our last two visits made me never want to return.  We had the same server, Jennifer S., both times. Her initial approach to the table took exceedingly long both times ( over 15 minutes). Once we got out drink and appetizer order in the waiting only further continued. Drinks took another 15 minutes to come out (soft drinks) and the appetizers never came out at all. Spoke with the manger, he apologized, and said he would make sure everything went more smoothly.  He could only compensate so much for the lack of abilities from the server. Once our food came out, she, along with anyone else, besides the manager once, never checked on us again for the remainder of our visit.   We decided to give them another chance today, assuming that maybe it was a fluke. However, once we were seated and again started waiting, we knew there was a reason why we didn't want to come back. We had the same server as last time. This time, she greater us and it only took ten minutes. Drinks and appetizers came out in another ten, but we were without silverware. Our food came out in another half and hour, but we were still without silver because nobody had checked on us since we received our drinks and appetizers. So now, with salads, appetizers, both untouched because of no silverware, we had more food. Silverware came out when it decided it wanted to apparently. After speaking to the manager again, and explaining the events on this occasion and the last, he apologized and we received silverware. Our server came back once more before the end of the meal, and that was to drop off the bill. We had no refills or boxes until right when we were going to walk out.  This being said, the food here is excellent and has always been.  Our service, and our server, were the worst I have ever experienced. Every time we would ask for something, which surprisingly wasn't that often since she rarely made an appearance at the table, she would say \"thank you\".  Even when she forgot something, there was no apology, only a \"thank you\". She obviously doesn't care about returning customers or customer service at all for that matter. She is bringing the restaurant down single handedly. I can, in no way, speak for others who she served, but I did hear other tables around us complaining at the same time.   We would love to have a reason to come back here, but due to the lack of service quality, follow through from management, and overall poor dining experience, I don't know if I will be returning.   If you must eat at BJ's restaurants, please choose another location at the very least. You will be disappointed if you cone here expecting a nice experience. \"Thank you\"",

They have a large selection of house beers from very light to very dark.  There is also a very large selection of non-house beers on tap and in bottles.  I didn't drink any beer that night so this review is just for the food and service.  Again since this is a chain, so I feel there is nothing special about the food.  It is your typical brewpub items such as artichoke dip, potato skins, buffalo wings, pizza, etc.  The food wasn't bad by any means, but nothing really stood out.  The staff was nice enought to let us partake in late night happy hour specials (2200 to close) 15 minutes early.  The specials were $2 off all apps and 1/2 off all the mini sized pizzas.  The service was efficient and friendly.  My ice tea was refilled frequently even though I wasn't sitting at the bar.  Total bill for my mini pizza and chicken fingers was $18 with tax and tip.",

We went around 8:30pm- we noramlly eat lunch here so I don't know if at dinnertime the cooks are just too tired or what? Anyways, Our appetizer was Fried Calamari and it was not good at all and oh so cold. This should have been hot but we were so hungry that we dug in and we shouldn't have our tummies paid the price later...That was another thing there wasn't many people in here(Thursday night)  but the service was so slow.  Fish Tacos- Horrible, the BF took one bite and it was cold inside the fried fish- the guacamole was sour- so this dish was sent back and Tomato Soup was ordered.... Chili in Bread Bowl- Chili had a bitter taste to it, almost like Raid. Now I have gotten this before and enjoyed it so I know how this dish should taste here when it's good. Clam Chowder in Bread Bowl- My daughter enjoyed this dish and actually the rest of us ate this too as we were waiting for our meal replacements.... My Orange Cream Soda was good as usual but I was just so surprised at the outcome of the rest of the food, very disappointed to say the least!!  I must say that even though the food sucked and the service was hella slow our waitress when around was very nice and accomodating. I am not going to say that I'm never coming back here but I'll just count this evening as an off visit for whatever reason and hopfully I'll never have to experience that again or anyone else for that matter....",

Every time we want to go to this place we try to just walk in but there is always a wait on the weekends.  not just a little wait, a good 40 minute wait.  so we end up going somewhere else.  This time I thought to call ahead and put our name on the list.  I highly recommend doing this if you are going to go on the weekend.   I ordered the buffalo chicken pizza.  There are different sizes.  I asked the waitress what difference between the mini and small pizza was.  She said the mini was more individual and the small was about a little bigger. She recommended ordering the small because I said I was hungry.  The buffalo chicken pizza was great.  It is a deep dish pizza that includes two of my favorite foods (Buffalo chicken wings & Pizza.)  I also ordered a nutty brewnette pint because this is a brew house.  It was ok, not great.  It is a brown ale similar to new castle.  New castle is a lot tastier.  If you like hand crafted brews and pizza this is a cool place to go.",

I've been to this BJ's about 7 times and each time (except once) they have failed to give me what I ordered on the first try. I always come in with a group of people from work and we fax our order in before we get there. The kitchen has our order, in writing, right in front of them and still can't execute it properly. I know a veggie pizza with no cheese is a terribly complicated concept but come on! EVERY TIME! I've gotten it delivered with cheese and I've even gotten it delivered without the cheese but with sausage added! Sausage?!  The wait staff is always apologetic but the kitchen here seems to be inept.",

Their beer prices are some of the best in town, especially if you make it during lunch or happy hour.  The Parmesan crusted chicken came ($13.95)with excitement and accolades from the bartender, so I decided to give it a try.  It was wonderful and comparable quality to many high-end restaurants.  This meal was seriously amazing and I would order it again tomorrow.  The bartenders are great, the beer is great, and the food is great!  We always have friendly service and get our money's worth every time we visit.",

Happy hour could be a little happier on the pricing I think.  Pizzas are good, but not grand. Tomato bisque here is the god, though. Get the bisque! Monkey bread pizookie is also a winner in my book. Glad to see that option has stuck around on the menu for a while now. Love their fries, too.  Totally worth it to sign up for their emails. Free pizookies and decent dollar amount off promotions all the time!",

I called in to speak with the manager and I was disconnected . I reached out around 6ish . I tried to reframe from making this review on a social platform but I was forced to. I requested the name of this host from server whom actually was very polite about the situation and apologized on their behalf . This was my first time there and possibly my last .

Pull in, call the number on the sign, and they bring your food right to you. 2: Santa Fe Spring Rolls...YUM! 3: Avocado Egg Rolls are ordered every time, and are always good. 4: Mediterranean Pizza. It's a taste that's not for everyone but if you love Kalamata olives like I do, you know what you want and this is a good place to get it.   Inside service can be hit or miss so we just order it to go so we can sit at home and watch Netflix without having to put up with a lot of extra noise, or watch a good game without sound which I don't like doing. 4 Stars...yeah, it's been awhile since I did my last review but 4 years later I'm still going back, and it's still good.",

Then he had the gall to ask if I wanted my dessert now!  Seriously!  He said he would send over the manager and that never happened either.  Instead he came back and said he just write off my meal.

I actually walked out because my salmon took until 5:00 for some reason and the waiter was so dumb he said our order was taking longer because of the salmon.. How stupid is he to offend a customer, really?  I wouldn't have cared so much had not ALL of the booths around us filled up and they were all leaving or having dessert when our food finally came and the table in front of us had all steaks!  When he used the salmon excuse I told him it was easier than steak and he ran off like a baby and I wasn't even loud.. So weird.. Not going back to this B.J.'s and always ask myself if these people interviewed for a job being as negligent as they are as waiters.. Oh, to defend this place I could tell his co-workers were thinking, \"Oh God, he sucks.. \"",

(2 kids and 1 baby.) had to wait half an hour for a table but that was expected. we had a really nice server but i forgot his name. he was from hawaii and made conversation with us. was funny and joked around. the place was busy but he kept checking on us. got all of our food and drink orders right. i had a bite of the calamari and it was pretty good. shared the medium deep dish sausage and pepperoni pizza. had a few pieces to take home with the boyfriend. had a slice of BJ's favorite pizza and i loved that. (sadly my boyfriend doesn't dig veggies like i do so i had to sample from his grandparents plate.) so much green peppers and olives. all the colors on it made me love it even more. i say if you don't want to wait for a table go on a week night when i would assume them to be less busy, but their deep dish pizza is really worth trying out with a glass of red wine.",

    "text": "If I had written a review 6 months ago I'm sure I would have given BJ's 5 stars, however, my last few visits have left somewhat of a bitter taste in my mouth. The food and drinks here are always more than great, but the service which used to be just as good no longer lives up to my expectations. Both of my last visits were on slow nights where we were one of only a handful of tables in the restaurant.   Now I work in the service industry so I can understand certain situations but being that our server only had a couple other tables I cannot grasp the fact that he kept disappearing for lengthy periods at a time. When we first arrived he greeted us in a timely manner and brought us our waters. We then ordered an appetizer to share while deciding on our entrees. Almost 20 minutes went by before we saw our appetizer or our server again. He dropped off the appetizer in a hurry, didn't ask if we were ready to order (which we were) and proceeded to disappear again. We were done with our appetizer for 5 minutes before he finally reappeared and took our order. The food was great but we just couldn't understand where he kept disappearing off to. We even had to flag down other servers to get things we needed, like refills for our constantly empty waters (biggest pet peeve).    This experience won't necessarily stop me from returning because as I've mentioned I love the food, but I certainly hope they do something to improve their lacking service.",

But he also forgot to put in our appetizer order. His saving grace was the fact he kept the drinks coming.   Drinks- Cherry Cola Throwbacks. Hot damn those are De-licious! Packed with booze and large amounts of sugar, but it just tastes like a soda fountain Cherry Cola. What an intoxicating treat.   Pizza- Margherita Deep Dish add Mushrooms. This pizza wasn't any better than a Red Baron pizza you microwave at home. Nothing about it was memorable or delicious.   Dessert- Chocolate Chip/Peanut Butter Pazookie. It is what it is. Hot cookie with ice cream. Nothing more, nothing less. Enjoyed by all.   Overall BJ's is not remarkable to me and I will not go out of my way to return. I will gladly pay higher prices for MUCH better food elsewhere.",

The staff never seems to have a problem with this either. Kudos to them.  The menu is surprisingly extensive, and the food quality is great for the price. I enjoy the salads, and the deep dish pizzas are incredibly tasty. Also, get the Pizookie Party Platter with a small group!

I think the biggest problem was our server...just slow and never around.  for example, one of us ordered unlimited soup and salad and the waitress never came around to refill the soup or salad.  when she did finally come by, we asked about a certain soup and she said she didn't know so she will bring a sample of it.  that alone took 10 min to bring a sample.  my friend liked the sample so he requested it and that took another 10 min.  we even had to tell her that we were in a hurry, but still no change in service style, she was never around.    on a plus note, the pazookie got more flavors/options (I think) and its still as good as I remember first having it.  definitely end with a  pazookie!",

They have a few drink specials and food menu items. order a mini pizza, lettuce wraps, flat bread something with avocado,  and mini sliders.  it was filling for three people that we had and it was a little disappointing with the lettuce wraps and there was only three pieces of lettuce and to me lettuce is the cheapest thing as it was just head lettuce or ice burg as they are called. I had a glass of there root beer from tap and a glass of the black cheery from tap as they make there own.  They had some kind d of santa fe spring rolls and avocado roll also on the menu and some kind of parmesan boneless chicken.  If you go at four pm it is just the right time as they are not busy, but the service was kind of slow, but if you are there with people great chance to chat and catch up without being rushed, as the service is just the right speed at this time of day before the dinner rush.  Will need to go back to try the other happy hour specials that I haven't tried yet. tried the full dinner menu items as well and they have a lot of choices to chose from. menu is quick large, and plenty items to chose from. pizza is alway yummy and there salad are good too. Enjoy!",

We waited about ten minutes for her to come by our table.  We ordered a large pizza and several sides. The pizza came out about 30 minutes later. It was LUKEWARM at best. The crust on one side was so soggy it was pathetic. The manager was called over. He asked if we wanted another pizza (another 30 minute wait?? Not likely!!) He then left the table with no other comment. The waitress came by and said she would take off the cost of the pizza. It took two tries to get the ticket adjusted.  Too many other good pizza places around to give this place another chance. Life is too short!",

The only thing half edible was the margarita pizza, which was super small even. It is not even fun to hang out in there. There is just no flavor in the food.  I usually order the pazookie which is my favorite.  My food was so disappointing I decided to skip the dessert to go somewhere else.

Not only did she give us her honest opinion on selections, she kept the refills coming and we never felt like we had to hunt someone down for something. Honestly, I want to start coming and asking for one of her tables, because she made us feel welcome even if it was rather late in the night and she had another huge table she was serving. I'd definitely recommend asking for her as your waitress.",

I had dinner there last night with my parents.  We were all excited to go, cuz someone told us it was really good.  I really don't like leaving a negative review for places, but It was that bad.  We came in about 7pm, and we went to the hostess stand.  She just kind of stared at us, and never greeted us.  Not a hello, nothing.  Ok, whatever, maybe shes having a bad night or something.  So we tell her that we'd like a table for 3.  The other hostess came over to seat us, and kind of dropped menus in front of us on the table and just left.  No \"hi\" or anything.  It was weird.  The restaurant was a little busy, but there were still many open tables and a lot of FOH employees on the floor.  It was a normal dinner time type of busy.  Not anything extreme.   Our server comes over and gets our drink order, and right off the bat he seems to really not want to be there.  OhhhhKay.... do we like have the plague or something and not know??  We'd really like to know if we are contagious or something.  The food DID come out quickly, and we really enjoyed our appetizer.  But, we would have enjoyed it even more IF WE HAD SILVERWARE AND NAPKINS.  Like we tried to get ANYONE'S attention to get silverware, but employes passed our table and glanced at us, then pretended not to see us!  omg!  So we used our 3 beverage napkins.  We seriously tried to obtain some utensils.  It was super lame.    A runner came out and delivered our meals, and then she tried to bounce out all quick!  So, we flagged her down as she was leaving and asked for silverware.  And I hate flagging down an employee because I think it's rude and tacky, but we couldn't get ANYONE'S attention any other polite way.  Our server did keep our drinks topped off, but I would have loved to get another beer - but I couldn't!!!  I was never asked if I wanted another, and I could not get him to stay at the table for more than like 3 seconds.  By the end of our dinner, we actually laughed amongst ourselves because the service was unbelievably bad.  We actually felt uncomfortable there.  What sucks is we went there to enjoy ourselves, and the food was good.  But wow... we made contact with 4 employees there and they all seemed standoffish, unfriendly, and we got the feeling that they all hated their job.  Like they really hated it.  I'd go as far to say they despised working there.  I mean, is there like a horrible manager there that they all hate??  We felt like we entered the twilight zone.   As I stared longingly at my empty beer glass we got the 68 dollar check, paid and left.  At least, at this very point we got a \"thank you\"!  That was nice, however too late to retain us as customers.  What's sad is we really enjoyed the food, but we felt very uncomfortable.  We were kind of annoyed that we felt obligated to tip, but we felt like it's just not right to not tip someone. So yeah... AKWARD!!!",

    "text": "I have been here quite a few times and added a star because the service is great and the beer is solid, however the food is very weak.  I first ate a BJs in Southern California about 10 years ago. The deep dish pizza was amazing; hot and fresh and very delicious, as was everything else. Now, the food at this location or perhaps at all locations is extremely subpar compared to what they used to serve. It almost always comes out room temperature and has obviously been pre-prepped and then slightly heated before being served. A deep dish pizza that comes out at room temperature is probably one of the most disappointing experiences a man can go through. However, if you can get the food made fresh, it is still great, but that's the problem.  A couple visits back I had a dish that was as stated above, room temp and old. I let them know and they brought me a fresh dish; it was great. This is not how a restaurant should operate; especially not BJs, when the food can be great.  I am pretty sure they keep this up because most people just accept it; sad. If you guys get your stuff together and start making the food fresh; let me know and I will give you another shot. Until then, no mas BJs for me.  Why are people so accepting of this and still flock to this joint?!?!",

My husband and I shared the Santa Fe salad and the Alfredo chicken pasta. Both plates had gross chicken. The salad was bearable at best. The pasta I sent back because I asked for the chicken well done and it wasn't at all. It was rubbery and veiny. When they brought it back they chopped up the same chicken and tossed more sauce on it. Annoying but not worth the battle obviously. I ate around it. The service was good. I just won't be back because of the food. I haven't had good food here in a while.",

Waited another 30 for our dinners... Our server seemed over worked and unapologetic.  The food was average. Deep dish ravioli was good,pepperoni pizza was ok the roast beef dip was dry, chicken Alfredo was dry...

Depending on the time of day you arrive, you will probably wait and have to park in the adjacent lot. One trick we used to do growing up that we still do, is drop one person off at the door to put our name down while the other parks. It saves time!   At BJs, they have a skinny menu that tells you the calories for the items. For those who don't care, there plenty of higher calorie tasty menu items as well- Burgers, Pizza flatbreads, etc  BJs has also jumped on the Sriracha band wagon, a favorite hot sauce to us Asians. They have created a Mac and cheese with Sriracha sauce... Amazing! My daughter likes this dish and I have taken several bites off her plate, I do like it. If you want something spicy or have kids that have jumped on the Sriracha bandwagon, this is a GoTo.  I really enjoy their lower calorie items like the seared Ahi tuna salad or their quinoa bowls. The ahi tuna salad is just fantastic. A large bowl of greens, with dabs of wasabi sauce on the sides of the dish. The ahi tuna is nicely seared and adds a fab protein. Highly recommend!",

If you're looking for a wide range of food choices, great drinks and beer, a casual atmosphere and friendly service, BJs is a great place for lunch or dinner.   We've come with family, friends, and our little one and it never disappoints. The food is a-okay and nothing to write home about but filling for what you're craving.   I love the roasted brussel sprouts, salads, and sandwich combos!",

Finally I had to walk over to find out what the hell is happening that everyone who walked in after us got seated in 5-10 minutes and there we were right in front of them just waiting. That's when it was discovered that our name was missed. So opt to sit at the bar or prepare to be waiting while ur name is missed because 3 hostesses at the front are more into their Starbucks than keeping tracks",

I wish the waiter had name tags, so we can better leave review about them, because there are some runners and they somehow do an amazing job, but never have the chance to be mentioned due of no name tag. So every single time we've been there, there is a young guy, Black hair, very nice, seam to be a runner and does an out of this world job.",

    "text": "We recently visited this location and had the best experience and most amazing food ever. To start, I thought I'd try the Ahi Poke. What an excellent decision. The Ahi Tuna was a great portion and had soy sauce lightly drizzled on top (you didn't notice it - you only tasted it). It came with about seven cheesy chips and avocado as well as cabbage. I highly recommend this for a quickly-delivered bite to eat while you're trying to find your main course in the menu. For my main course, I had a pizza called \"The Italian Market.\" It was amazing. Tasted like pizza from Italy itself. Very little sauce - but you could definitely taste it. Very thin crust - but perfectly cooked so as to not dump your toppings on your lap (and it tasted of a great toasted element). To drink I had BJ's own Root Beer and it was perfect. I'm not a big fan of black licorice and most root beer's leave a black licorice taste in your mouth. This one did not. It left a sweet root taste in your mouth that worked well with the food choices for the evening. Matt served us and he was a great waiter. We were able to download the brand-new BJ's app, pay with it (using Apple Pay) and got a free mini pizookie on our next visit! Needless to say, we'll be back to claim our free mini pizookie and I might just order the exact same thing. If it ain't broke, don't fix it, right?!",

We walked in and the resaurant was pretty busy and we were seated promptly. When seated, we waited like 15 minutes for a hostess or someone for drinks and no one came.  I finally waived down a waitress and asked about our waitress and soon after that we were greeted by Holly Turns our the hostess forgot to tell Holly that she seated a large party out of her section, so it was definitely not her fault. This woman was just the best. She totally did her best to make up for the mistake of another person. She was fast, on point, and kind as could be.  She then gave us our appetizers for free. I love when people know more than just basic customer service and know how to make a negative situation positive.  As for the food, I think of BJ's as one of those reliable chains where you know you'll get good food. Kind of like Cheesecake. I got the jalapeno burger and it was good, but not anything I would praise about.  Whoever is reading this from BJs, please give her a pat on the back. Thanks again Holly!",

We ordered appetizers, various mains, and desserts. There wasn't one thing we didn't like, even the kids liked their orders!  For appetizers, the flatbread nachos and potstickers were a hit. I eat potstickers anywhere they are offered and these are among the best I've had. Crispy on the bottom, but steamed perfectly, with a ginger soy dipping sauce. I'd order these as my main course.  I ordered the prime rib dip sandwich with fries. Fries are more of a beer battered fry which I like. The prime rib was cooked to about med rare, shaved thin, on a roll, au jus ok the side for dipping.  Two people ordered the root beer ribs-tangy, sweet, slightly spicy, tender meat both liked them.  We ended with the salted caramel pazookie- a cookie baked in a small cast iron skillet, topped with ice cream and salted caramel. I'd go back just for this.  If you like lots of choices, and good food on top of that, give BJ's a try.",

In the past, Cheesecake Factory would be my go to place for a large menu with a lot of great choices but BJ's has certainly replaced CF for me. Every time I leave, I cannot wait to go again.   During my last visit, I was introduced to their mobile app which I can use to pay and earn rewards. I love user friendly tech additions so BJ's really won me over with this one.

I'm requesting Sita every time I go to BJ's!  Since the last posting, I went back to BJ's with a couple friends and my daughter to again watch a hockey game. My daughter is 3, and I know that as a server having a 3 year olds is not an easy task. We requested Sita again.  Sita remembered what we liked to drink, and the special requests that my daughter had the first time and this time brought it without even being asked.  Because of Sita's exceptional service and overall stellar disposition, we have become a regular at BJ's!",

As usual most of the food was great (mahi/shrimp tacos, and stuffed mushroom appetizer) but my sons chicken tenders and fries were just ok. They literally came out 3 minutes after I ordered them but they weren't up to typical BJs standard. Shame on me for ordering from the kids menu. The berry cider was decent but I sure do miss the pear cider, I'll live. Amy was our server and she was great, she was fast, friendly and anyone would be lucky to have her as their server. Oh and unless the food is horrendous I don't complain I just don't order it next time or I don't go back. I'm not a \"talk to the manager\" kinda gal. I've been here a ton of times and I've just about filtered out what's good and what's not. Just remember that you can't go wrong on Mondays when a large pizza is half off!",

So we decided to use the coupon today, having such a great experience the first time here but now the server say we cannot use the coupon. We asked if the manager can explain why we cannot redeem it and he fixed it for us. Overall, food is awesome here. It's not expensive especially if you  take advantage of their specials.

Before our meal, we ordered the avocado egg rolls and the Brussel sprouts. He egg rolls are alway a favorite of mine and although the Brussel sprouts were not my cup of tea, they were edible and my friends seem to enjoy them. I was able to pick an alternative side with my shrimp tacos, which were seasoned well and very delicious! My husband ordered the pork chop and as you can see, was quite massive!

They were about 40-45 minutes later than the scheduled delivery time.  - Chicken breast was tender and charcoal flavor was not overbearing like some charcoal grilled chicken breast can be from other places. - pizza was warm still, with a crust resembling pizza hut. Less marinara than I prefer, only a thin layer under the toppings. - toppings are plentyful, and of average quality. Crust was soft, not crunchy, probably due to having sat in a warming bag for a while. - ribs were ok, a bit on the dry side. - salad was very basic, with the majority of the lettuce being iceberg (see pic). - meatballs were very soft, mainly due to the large amount of dough rolled into them, resulting in a diluted meat flavor that leaves them fairly bland. - pasta was just boiled pasta, marinara was not very flavorful either. - chicken nuggets could have come from the frozen section of the grocery store. - sausage was just your average sausage with spices.  Overall, the best parts of the meal were the pizza and chicken breast in my opinion. I don't intend to go eat there in the future, as there was no food item that I had that was more unique than something you could find at a grocery store.",

When I mentioned it was my sisters birthday the hostess never even acknowledged the fact that it was her birthday she just looked at me. Also the wait for our food was pretty long considering the fact that it wasn't that busy that night. But, the wait wasn't a problem, it was the fact that our waiter never updated us. Never let us know the foods coming out. And once the food came out, our waiter checked up on us once And as time went on we were finished with our meals and needed boxes and a check and our waiter was nowhere to be found. It's such a disappointment when a restaurant you consider a staple to the family delivers such poor service. I'm not sure if we'll be celebrating anymore birthdays, or just general dinners, at BJ's anymore.",

I watched him talk to all his customer near me the same way. He's really forgetful meaning he took my drink for refill and didn't return it til I was done with my food lucky I had water yes I tried to get his attention but he said hold on. I just had to laugh other then make a scene with someone that's seems to have less then a high school diploma. I ask for my check he took about 10 min to give me that. I also needed a Togo container he took another 10 min for that when he came back I needed Togo silverware which I asked for when I asked for container he had attitude walking away then he started to argue with front counter lady everyone started to watch that scene he was putting on as I'm still waiting for my things so I could leave.. please do not have this waiter service you He really needs to be fired I don't think training can help this guy at all. Worst service I've had ever in place or country I've been to please be advised of his service",

    "text": "I didn't see myself coming back here and trying the pizza again. However, with a group dinner scheduled for this place, I had no choice in the matter.  It took a while after our reservation time, but we were finally seated in the dining area on the street-facing side of the restaurant. I found out that the food was presented buffet-style for us, and it was right up by the wall for us to access. I guess no enterprising neighbors bothered to try to filch some extra food, but we ended up with extra food at the end.  Our menu included a house salad, with an Italian dressing and a ranch dressing, a grilled chicken pasta with creamy white sauce and broccoli (and apparently not enough chicken at all), and various pizzas. The pizzas were way better than last time, mainly because the crust was not soggy. I guess they know how to cook the smaller pizzas than whatever gigantic monstrosity I experienced in my last review. I didn't get to try the combo, but the pepperoni and the chicken (with mushrooms and tomatoes) were both very solid.  Most of us also ended up ordering mini pizzokies. My choice of the triple chocolate was a super sweet potentially-diabetes-inducing assault, and I enjoyed it aside from quickly gobbling up the Ghirardelli chocolate square because it wasn't going to be easy to break into small and even pieces.  The one thing I didn't appreciate was that we didn't get refills on water until long after dessert. I didn't find any of the foods particularly salty, but I had a problem when I simultaneously craved and lacked water at the end of my meal. Thankfully, we got additional water refills even while we were just lounging and chatting after dessert, which made the night less uncomfortable in the end.  Owing to the improvement in pizza, I'm comfortable in bumping my rating up to four stars. Although my first choice on Eastern Avenue wouldn't be a chain, I wouldn't mind coming back here at all.",

We were notified they no longer had the crispy thin fries. Appalled, but decided to give the new ones a chance. I HATED THEM. lacking flavor and to be honest i'd rather have their cold thin fries over these any day. They definitely will be losing our weekly or even bi weekly visits. Up the price if you're losing money, but don't change something so good.",

    "text": "It was Mother's Day, and after being dumped at the crepe shop, our group was feeling stood up and a touch angry- but were able to get a table at BJ's with a bearable wait time.   I was surprised with how good the service was on such a busy day. The service was slow, but everything made it's way out within 40 minutes of when our food order was placed, and amazingly there was not a single thing wrong with any of our food. Is it sad that I expect something to go wrong with someone's order in a large group?   This is a generic BJs, and the food is rarely ever anything that wows me so I was slightly disappointed that we had driven from NoLaVe to Hendertucky to get a pizza at BJs (huh.. hello.. we live around the corner from Old School Pizzeria!) but what really was outstanding was the service provided my the manager on duty. He was great in making sure our large group had enough room to dine comfortably, and even came back around to check up on us again. BRAVO! Finally, after a dry spell of awful service we have a day of good service, I had even started to feel like I was jaded about service.  Will I be back? Probably not to this one since it's so far, but I have no problems visiting another BJs- we probably frequent the chain twice a year when I'm feeling too lazy to cook and we can't decide on anything.",

    "text": "So this wasn't our first choice, or our second choice, or even our third choice. But it was lunch time on Mother's Day (I know...good timing), so we took what we could get without having to drive around town. They were really busy (I know, big surprise!), but they took really good care of our large party, the manager was our savior that day! The food was typical BJ's, I've eaten here before, Fridays/Chili's chain type food, it's average but not at all what any of us wanted (it's not their fault).  I was in dire need of a cocktail at this point, I got the Tickled Pick, a bit sweet but good. We all shared some of the Children's Captain Crunch French Toast, it was good but you couldn't tell it had Captain Crunch on it:( I ordered the Shrimp Tacos for lunch, they were surprisingly better than expected. South Eastern Avenue has such a wide array of food choices I doubt I'll be back anytime soon, but it works when your stuck between a crepe and a closed place. (Inside joke)",

    "text": "BJ's has to be one of my favorite chain restaurants in Vegas! They have incredible lunch specials and literally everything on the menu is good. My husband and I eat here at least once a month. We usually share a small pizza, which is plenty. They serve deep dish style pizza, while not exactly reminiscent of Chicago it is no doubt delicious. There isn't really sauce on the pizza, but there are tomatoes which I tend to push aside. The pizza is best complimented with a delicious Cobb salad. This salad is fantastic with a creamy garlic dressing, croutons, turkey, avocado, and cheese. I also enjoy their sandwiches and you really can't go wrong with their wedge or shoestring fries. I haven't tried anything that I didn't like and they have quite an extensive menu. It is seriously delicious American style food.  If you find yourself here you really must get a Pizookie for dessert, it is required and I often come here just for a Pizookie! Who doesn't want a warm chocolate chunk cookie with vanilla bean ice cream? So unbelievably yummy.   I have received spotty service at times, but overall BJ's is a fantastic go-to restaurant if you want quality, affordable, and delicious food that everyone will love.",

The server looked nervous and rushed when he greeted us. We asked for a refill three times on our drinks and never got it.   Our appetizers, asparagus and spinach dip, came after 10 minutes after our main dishes. It tasted bland. And my brother who eats anything even said it wasn't good. There was no taste. My moms clam chowder was way too salty. My burger was not a burger but rather a sandwich. The vegetables along with the avocados was slipping out.",

    "text": "I ABSOLUTELY LOVE BJ'S!   Food: I love the Cajun Pasta, Usually when I go out to eat I'm not very adventurous. I like to stick to what I know but for some odd reason I decided to try something new. Cajun pasta, hmm first off I wasn't to sure how I would like this because I love Cajun spices of on my seafood but I wasn't to sure how I'd like it on my pasta. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT. The creamy tomato sauce with the roasted blacken chicken breast YUMMMM. The portions are even great, once me and my boyfriend went and we actually just ordered 1 Cajun pasta and when asked them for an extra plate because we were sharing they offered to just put it together in the kitchen for us & it was perfect for two!   Desert: If you haven't tried Bj's famous Pizookie your missing out. A cookie that's freshly baked right out of the oven warm topped with Vanilla ice cream is to die for. Even when I'm stuffed from my entree i'll still find room for a Pizookie. Some how! lol  Drinks: I love their wide range of beers on tap, unfortunately they didn't have the blue moon pumpkin beer because it's only a seasonal beer. Tap beer is always better then bottle or canned Just saying...  Service: I  usually go pretty late like 9:30-10ish? & I'm usually 1 out of 5 tables there. So its not busy during those hours but the waitress that we got was super nice. The hostess seated me and my boyfriend at a table that was just way to big for us and it made it difficult for us to kind of talk and dine together so the waitress noticed this and asked if we wanted to change tables. Other than that and when ordering she offered to tell the cooks in the back to split my Cajun pasta into two plates because I was sharing. I've never been to a restaurant where they offered to split it in the back for me. Usually they just hand me my extra plate so I really appreciated the extra effort to help :)",

    "text": "We have eaten here before and enjoyed everything, but we never had such horrible service as we experienced tonight for dinner. I had mentioned to the hostess and the manager that we were celebrating my Dad's 83rd birthday and that we would be ordering desert for him, (hoping they would at least put a candle on it). My father ordered coffee with cream and sugar, the waitress (Patricia) bought the coffee and cream but said she would be back with the sugar?? She bought him extra coffee in a little stainless steel teapot which did not keep the coffee hot. When he was ready for more coffee she bought him a cup but forgot the cream and said she would be back with the cream?? He sat for at least 5 minutes waiting for cream before someone else finally bought it. We wanted to order desert before we were done eating but she never came back. So when she finally took our dinner plates away we ordered desert and waited. She gave us our check before the desert even arrived and when another server brought the desert out--no candle--no have a happy birthday--nothing. The food was very good, especially the Barbecue chicken salad, but the service was not acceptable. And bring a flashlight to see the menu, some of the tables are so dark you can't read the menu. We watched other tables struggle to find some light to read the menu also.",

Why did I keep going back? Reading their menu, I get enticed (although I usually end up let down) AND it is literally located about a block away from my home...so convenience. ANYWAY...its the service mainly that gave is making me give this place 2 stars...horriblly horribly SLOW, and just plain terrible. EVERY time I've been here...so I give up on this place.   Also, with tthis most recent visit...the first time I can say the food was just plain BAD. I ordered a  \"honey cripy chicken salad\" or something...okay, there was NOTHING honey about the chicken (breading or what not)...it was just some plain old chicken tenders...and the salad was really watery, so when they mixed in the dressing for the chopped salad...it had no flavor whatsoever....of course when I asked for a side of dressing after experiencing that I had to WAIT (see above)....ugh, I just plain give up on this place!!!",

    "text": "Me and my family (party of 6) went there for dinner a few nights ago. There was a 45 minute wait. No big deal. 55 mins pass and our buzzer finally buzzes. The hostesses then tell us to stand by the stairs and wait.  Another 15 minutes of waiting we had to do..and people kept walking by us so we felt VERY in the way. I asked a hostess why we had to stand and wait here and she said \"so youre ready\". uhm okay? I was perfectly ready in my spot on the seat thankyouverymuch. Anyway, we ended up being crammed into a booth. Oh well, at least we all love each other in my family. Then the server was very blah..Not bad but not good. It was busy so im sure he was in the weeds a bit. I had the santa fe salad and about died..YUM! The rest was good but those hostesses need to get it together. I AM a hostess and have been for years so I know how things go and I would NEVER make a party stand in the middle of a walk way for 15 minutes to \"be prepared\".",

    "text": "As a whole I like BJ's Brewhouse.  I just didn't much care for my experience at this one.  My daughter and I (She's the LV resident) went in for lunch and took a booth in the bar.  Since I am somewhat a regular at my local BJs I already knew what I wanted.  The California Burger and a Blue Moon.  Our server tries to talk me out of my beer choice because he thought down selling was going to be a wise choice.  When I told him he could not get me to change my mind, he kept trying to do it.  This marks the first time he irritated me.  We place orders and it took almost 15 minutes for the appetizer to come out and this only after my daughter looked at her watch then looked at him (no, they were not busy.) This was our second irritation. The whole time we are waiting for our food, our tool of a server was standing at the end of the bar talking with the bartender.  This guy did not care about appearances and to me it was disrespectful to just be seen hanging out. Now I am getting pissed.  Fast forward now...food comes out, granted they are still not busy, us and maybe one other table in the bar.  My sandwich and fries come out, the fries are barely warm and bottom of my sandwich is soggy.  Probably because our server left it sitting too long while he was yapping with the bartender.  I am giving the restaurant 3 stars because I do still like the place.  Our server, in my opinion deserves negative stars.  I will not name our server, but the management should start watching what goes on in the restaurant.",

We like BJ's because of their gluten free options.  Although this location didn't have the gluten free crust, they still had the menu and the manager even came out and personally addressed my allergy and indicated he would oversee the preparation to make sure everything went well.  I thought that was above and beyond and the first time a manager had done that for me.  Service was great and food was great as usual!",

We requested a well done burger that was at most medium and the blackened salmon looked as if it had hit a frying pan with some butter and finished in the salamander.  Definitely not blackened.  The sauce on the plate tasted like water downed ranch dressing.  The clam chowder was over salted which took away from any taste it might have had.  They did comp us for the food and we paid for the drinks but in hindsight, should have also sent back the $10 margarita also.  We did tip the waitress appropriately since it was not her fault the food was lacking but we had to ask for silverware and napkins after the main course arrived.",

    "text": "Tried the gluten-free pizza. Crust was way better than Sammie's Woodfired, but needed to ask for a side of sauce. They don't carry vegan cheese so without the cheese the gf pizza is just a crust with 1 tablespoon? of sauce spread on it. First time the sauce the server brought was fresh out of the fridge- really? To put on a hot pizza? Then she came back with some warm sauce per our request- in the bowls they probably serve ketchup in but I only had 1 piece of pizza left after waiting for the sauce.  Luckily we had ordered 3 toppings ($1 each) or it would have been extremely sad. They really should have all their signature pizzas available to order & just charge extra for the gluten-free crust. It was still good but I can make this at home buying the gf crust from Whole Foods deli (tastes & looks the same). Not sure we'll be back again. This is not a real gf pizza like Picazzo's in Arizona or Fresh Brothers in LA. So still looking for a good vegan gluten-free pizza in Vegas.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I decided we wanted to treat ourselves to a nice lunch date together instead of the usual fast food run so we went to BJ's. BJ's isn't a fancy restaurant but it is a little more on the pricier side, but definitely worth it. We usually don't eat so heavily for lunch but we couldn't help ourselves once we saw the menu. We decided on the stuffed mushrooms for our appetizer because we heard a lot of good things about them and they were 100% right. The stuffed mushrooms were so delicious, perfect for an appetizer because the small portions definitely boosted up my appetite because I know for sure that I wanted more. Soon after our appetizer we received our soup of choice, I got the clam chowder and my boyfriend got their chili. The clam chowder was pretty good, nothing too special about it but there was nothing wrong with it either. The chili on the other hand needed an acquired taste I guess because I wasn't very fond of it because of the beer flavor. Since BJ's is a brewery I'm not surprised but it just didn't taste right to me. My boyfriend ate it because he ordered it but he wasn't the biggest fan of their chili either. (on a side note: a different time I went, I had their tomato soup and it was incredibly delicious...since we're on the soup subject.) after we finished our soup we noticed we weren't getting very good service because our server hadn't taken away our appetizer platter and we were done with our soups already, and our glasses were empty. Usually Im not picky and I don't mind but it wasn't busy at the time we went and our table was extremely tiny because it was just the two of us. I felt cluttered and a bit forgotten by our server. We ended up having to ask another server if they could take our plates and refill our drinks because our server was no where to be found. Anyways, when we finally got our main dishes, all was forgotten because the food was literally to die for. I ordered the Parmesan crusted chicken in lemon cream sauce. The portion was huge but I can't complain because I ordered from the dinner section, but I'm not complaining because leftovers was fine with me. I order an extra side of the lemon cream sauce because it was too delicious not to, and the chicken to sauce ratio was not sitting right with me with the extra sauce. Every bite was dreamy and delicious. The dish came with creamy garlic mashed potatoes and steamed green beans. The two sides went magnificently with the lemon cream sauce. If I could have, I most definitely would have finished but my stomach wouldn't allow it. My boyfriend ordered the jambalaya they serve there. I'm not a big fan of jambalaya in the first place so I don't want to comment on it since its already not my cup of tea. We knew about they're famous pizookies but we were way too full from our meal so we got our check, left a little less than decent tip for our ghost server and left. All in all the lunch was incredible. I definitely love this place.",
