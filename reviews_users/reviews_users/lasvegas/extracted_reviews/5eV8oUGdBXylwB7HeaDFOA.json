With that said, I've been to my fair share of Greek restaurants in the states and The Great Greek is hands down the best place I have ever been to. If you love garlic, raise your hands. If you love Greek food, raise your hands. You have reached my favorite Greek Food Location in Las Vegas. Not only do they offer great food, they sell good deserts too.",

I was told about the original location in Henderson and business took me to that side of town and I just had to try it.  It was amazingly good, just like the other one.  The Great Greek Gyro is just flat out great.  I have had both the beef/lamb and the chicken one.  I can't pick a favorite.  Do yourself a favor and get the Feta Fries.  Everything is so fresh and tasty.  The staff is super helpful and get the food out to you pretty quickly.  My only complaint is that there are not more of these around Las Vegas.",

You make a line, order and then you ate able to select a table and sit down.  The lemon chicken soup was very good.",

Inside isn't huge, but it was clean and there was a girl constantly cleaning tables and the floor under them. The woman at the counter who took our order was nice and gave us a number to put on the table. It took about 15 minutes for the food to come out, but the place was busy and they claimed to be making everything fresh so I didn't mind.  I ordered a side \"Classic Greek Salad\" priced at $4.95 with house made Greek vinaigrette. The salad had crisp greens, tomatoes, cucumbers, red onion, kalamata olives (has pits...be careful!) and feta cheese. The salad tasted fresh and the dressing was delicious. The salad also came with some grilled pita bread that I put some cucumber and tomato on and folded it up to grub on. Yum! Hubby got a burger (said the patty seemed frozen) and made it a combo with \"Feta Fries\" for us to share. The fries were excellent! Especially dipped in some of their tzaziki. I will be back to try a gyro and baklava.   They also have tables outside if eating inside isn't your thing or you can call ahead and place your order to-go. Ask about their family meal deals, they have a couple to choose from.",

Great Greek is certainly where it's at for gyros!   A hearty portion of wonderfully flavored beef/lamb meat is sliced thick and surrounded by a warm fluffy pita (the kind you'd feel comfortable resting your head upon if you weren't ready to devour it) in this truly special gyro!  I'm not sure if I would bestow it with the title of best gyro in the valley, but it is certainly one of the best. ... add some Feta Fries and a Greek Salad if you brought your beast appetite... or just want to save some for later because both are great options here. I tried some of my friends Avgolemono Soup...another great addition!  I haven't had the opportunity to try any of their other dishes, but I would order whatever I was in the mood for with confidence based on the quality of what I had.",

First time eating Greek food in a long time. And it was so fresh and amazing. I had the small Greek salad with chicken and steak skewer and melitzanosalata aka pureed roasted eggplant with pita. My friend had the great Greek rice bowl with steak and lamb skewer. They ask how you want your steak cooked as well. We were greeted by Brittney, she was awesome. Explained the whole menu and recommended the rice bowl. The place was super busy and she saved the open table for me so I didn't have to leave my purse there. The whole experience was great. This will be a new regular spot.",

    "text": "EXCELLENT and DELICIOUS FOOD, a FRIENDLY and INVITING STAFF, and IMMACULATE RESTROOMS!     This Greek bistro in Henderson is a winner on so many levels.  I'm fairly picky about Greek food and haven't been too satisfied with the choices of Greek-themed restaurants in Las Vegas, but The Great Greek in Henderson has won me over.  I ordered the Gyro plate, which was stuffed with ample meat and other fresh ingredients.  One another occasion I also tried the Avgolemono Soup (a traditional Greek chicken and lemon soup).  When I first tried this soup some 25 years ago, I fell in love with it.  I could tell that The Great Greek prepares this soup daily, as you can see and taste the fresh dill, roasted chicken and pasta in every spoonful.  I also highly recommend the Dolmades (stuffed grape leaves with rice and fresh herbs).  Squeeze a little fresh lemon on them for a tasty treat.  The Spanakopita is also delicious, made with spinach and feta cheese inside a light and flaky puff pastry.  What I like most about The Great Greek is the staff.  They remembered me each time I visited, they knew what I wanted and prepared my meals quickly, and they engaged in a friendly banter that made me feel right at home.    The Great Greek's menu is designed for customers to return again and again to try new dishes.  I've been there three times in one week!    Finally, dining at The Great Greek won't break your bank, unlike many other Greek-themed restaurants.  Just about every meal can be purchased for under $10.  Now THAT'S a bargain!    OPA!",

I always get the beef-lamb gyro combo with a side salad for ~$10. Since I always save the side salad for my dinner, that's a pretty good deal! The gyro is tender and flavorful, the tzatziki is just the right consistency, and the pita is always soft and delicious.

I think the meat here is a little thicker than the others I've tried, and it was seasoned well with just the right amount of salt.

I was looking for something healthy, quick and nearby and .. BAM!  This lil' place had good reviews and I hadn't had a gyro in 4-5 days!  Got there 5 min. after they opened, there was a chick taking pics of a plate ... prob. for some paper/mag. and the guy looked greek, the lady that took my order looked greek, so I was pretty confident that this place was going to be good.  11:15, this place was busy, no seats available and when I saw the Gyros come out, I knew why.  Everything was fresh, except for the pickled stuff, obviously ,,,and I think they make their own Tzatziki sauce since I've haven't had cucumbers in long strips.  Delish!  I highly recommend this place because they were not stingy on the proteins and that's always what most places skimp on.  took away a star since my order was lost in the shuffle due to a guy being late and didn't know who ordered first.  There is also outdoor seating but who the hell wants to sit out in 110 degree shade.... yeesh.",

Quite possibly the best chicken gyro I've ever had and their salad is right there with it (those are the only 2 things I've had).  One thing I did notice though is that the time it takes for food to come out can be long. I know that it bothered me a couple times primarily bc I had a to-go order and needed to get back to class, but the food took over 30 minutes to come out. However, the flavor and quality of the food made up for it. Just know that this isn't a stop and go kind of restaurant.  Prices are fair for what you're getting. Middle eastern/greek food is always going to be on the more pricier side, but then again its the quality that matters so the prices here are decent.  Service is great and everyone is nice over there! I'll be back for more!",

    "text": "What can I say...  food from The Great Greek is made with love and that's the not so secret ingredient!!!  First off, this place takes care!!!  The food that they serve is definitely a reflection of the quality of produce and products used!  This is an important element that differentiates their food from surrounding competitors, and it's a difference you can really taste.  Moreover, the food here is extremely affordable and definitely worth the price mark, add ons and all!  I'm always open to new food but when trying a new Greek restaurant I always take it back to basics.  Hummus and tzatzki with pita bread are ALWAYS a must for me so I was delighted with the fact that I had found a place who knew what they were doing.  The texture and seasoning was on point and I love the accompanying pita bread!!  It was thin, soft, warm and didn't overpower any of the dipping sauces.  In other words, it was not overly thick and hard.    Do try a little combo of the different appetizers such as the hummus, tzatzki, dolmades, pita bread!!  It's a wonderful selection of the most popular Greek comforts.  Those little dolmades were fresh, flavorful and stuffed just right.  Please... Do yourself a favor and get an order of the Great Greek feta fries. Damn!! This dish really won me over cause i'm a sucker for fries and this little twist was such a nice palate pleaser! Amazing!!  Can't stop thinking about them!  Gyros are tricky ordering for me because others i've tried either had too much of something, or too little.  The Great Greek's gyro was huge and each ingredient it was stuffed with did not outshine another; it was the perfect amount of everything.  Presentation is simple and to the point but also exhibits a hidden wow factor that I like.    The restaurant itself is extremely inviting and exudes a very \"my house is your house\" type of feeling!  Being that it is a family affair, there are no inconsistencies when it comes to service!!!  This is what I love about gems like these... It doesn't have that \"chain restaurant\" feeling... and that brings me back to the not so secret ingredient: love, love, love!!!  You can tell that you matter as soon as you step in cause you're always greeted with a smile and a welcoming hello!  Anyway... Go ahead and give The Great Greek a try for yourself.  You'll see just what I'm talking about once you take your first bite.  I highly recommend! *love*",

We were looking for something quick, delicious, and light since we were in town for a race and didn't want to eat typical \"travel food\". This place did not disappoint. I'm not a Greek food connoisseur but we have some pretty amazing restaurants back home, so I feel like I have enough street cred to say this place was amazing.   We had dolmades, chicken souvlaki, greay gyro, and some baklava. Yum, yum, yum. Moist and tangy dolmas. The chicken was just the right amount of salty/seasoned, and it was moist and tender! The baklava was perfect. Ooey gooey, sweet, and flaky on top. Not rich, just perfect.   Staff was friendly, too! Great service. HUGE servings. We were hungry, and we brought home half our gyro and souvlaki plate. We enjoyed a nice patio seat and relaxed while eating. The place was packed when we arrived and left, so that's always a good sign.   Highly recommend eating here!",

My stomach is angry at me for even attempting to write this while it is suffering, so I will keep it brief.  The spot is casual and spotless. You order at the counter. The prices are reasonable.   I ordered the chicken gyro combo and selected the Greek salad as my side, and as soon as it hit the table, I was in love. The pita was fluffy and piled high with every condiment I could covet. I snapped up a morsel of chicken that had fallen out, and I made a little \"oh yeah\" noise upon eating it. It was tender, juicy and filled with flavor. The side salad was super fresh and topped with the perfect Greek dressing.   I know it is trite to say, \"I wish it were closer,\" but it is True! I want a chicken gyro, and I want it now!",

The Food: I thought the Dolmades were very good. The Falafel was DYNAMITE!! VERY TASTY and filling. Then comes the feta fries. THERE was a recommendation to add hot sauce. So I did. I wanted to jump in the fries and live there. They were divine. One side note that doesn't matter but I had to say because it was kinda cool to me. Now I'm married and happily but the amount of beautiful women coming here to eat was phenomenal. They just kept coming. Anyways! Give this place a try. You will totally love it!!!!",

This place is ALWAYS packed, on my last visit a family of 3 had to cram into a 2 top table and I had no choice by to take mine to go (literally the only drawback to this spot is how popular it is, go figure).

    "text": "I was running errands and I happened to pass by the Great Greek. Earlier this week I went to another Greek restaurant that was just average, so I figured I would do a round 2 and hopefully score a better experience.  I did, but unfortunately not by much. From the outside it looks like a big place, but it is actually quite small with only a handful of tables to sit down at. It is very casual, and I suspect most people are taking their orders to go.  Surveying the menu, I decided on going for hummus, and Lamb Souvlaki with fries and a bottle of water. That turned out to be much more expensive that I thought for such a casual place. But if the food was great I can justify it.  My meal started with a greek salad (comes with the entree), and that was very good. Honestly, it was the best part of the meal. The hummus with pita bread came next. The hummus was good, much better than the last place. Creamy, with some whole garbanzos mixed in with some paprika and olive oil. The pita bread was nothing special, but worked for dipping into hummus.  Then came the Lamb Souvlaki and fries. The fries were very disappointing. It reminded me of my childhood when I would make Ore Ida Zesties freezer fries. The Lamb was cooked okay, but had very little seasoning on it. It just tasted like meat. It was good quality, but not properly seasoned.  A lot of this could be forgiven if it was properly priced, but as it is I wouldn't go back. While I was waiting for my food, three ladies went to order and there total was over $70. They were shocked and just left. So I think for this class of restaurant, the price is steep. But they seem to be doing okay, lol, so perhaps it is just me. :)",

We have a toddler and they are always super friendly to the baby and accommodating.  The food is delicious and well priced. We have eaten here several times and tried several dishes. They are all very good and worth your time.  We found the great Greek by searching for something outside of Vegas because we don't really want to fight the traffic or the crowd just to eat. This place is easy to find, easy to get to, lots of parking, no wait, fast service and even a patio.  So If your just in the area or looking for something good outside of Vegas this is a must try!",

    "text": "Today is Saturday and I hadn't eaten with the old folks for 4 weeks now. So I grabbed the better half, cranked the old beater car up with my cranker, shouted \"contact\", and off we went to take them out to dinner. I have been wanting to try these 2 Greek places out near Galleria Mall, since, well since the last time we went to eat. With a name like the Great Greek, it's got to be great, right?  It was very good. I don't think it was great. (It's The Good Greek to me.)The place is busy and fast paced. The kind of place where they are so busy that they might tell you to get the heck out and don't let the door hit your rear end on the way out, if you disagree, type of place. IF they were that type of establishment.  But the place is very cheery and inviting. We arrived at 6 so there was a line of 2-4 ppl. I didn't know what to expect when I walked in. So I heed and hawed until I figured out the arrangement. Yup, you order, they give you the numba and you sit down for them to bring the order out. I don't eat Greek too often. Ok, why lie?I don't eat it barely. So I stepped aside and stared at the menu on the wall. Since I couldn't make up my mind, I took a paper menu and stared at that some more, thinking something would jump at me.  The prices range from $2.95 for the feta fries to $12.49 for a entree dish. We ordered 3 dishes, feta fries (because all the good ppl of Yelp said they were to die for...a little more on that in a bit), and baklava for dessert. The girl taking the order is more than happy to teach you how to say these alien sounding words on the menu.  The tables have a nice touch with a flower in it. The place is bright and welcoming. The food came in about 10-15 min. I went to wash my hands in their uber clean restroom and hallway since I was anticipating eating my fries with my hands and not with a knife and fork as they do in England I am told (as that is how 007 would eat, being all debonair and a spy I suppose).  I munched on a fry and then I munched on another. It's crisp and fried hard but tasty. Not so hard that it will crack a tooth mind you but sufficiently more fried and nice and brown then McDonalds (my fries barometer). All I have to say is those people who die for the feta fries, they must not have much to live for. Because heil no I wouldn't die for this fries. They melted some feta cheese on the fries? Forgive me if I contain my exuberance. But I might shout more if I was in a shampoo commercial like Julia Louis Dreyfuss did years ago. The fries reminded me of In N Out chili fries. Does slapping a American Single on top of their fries denote chili fries?  Yeah, like that kind of to die for if you ask me. The fries is better enjoyed left alone without the accoutrement if you ask me. But then again, what do I know about Greeks besides their IMF downgrades and EU bailouts? I think I vaguely remember that they are famous for catering bathrobe parties in college fraternity houses.  We ordered the pasticcio, mezze plate, grilled steak souvlaki, and gyro plate. The steak was perfectly cooked medium rare and was tasty. The mezze plate composed of hummus, dolmades, falafel, tzaziki, and spanakopita (I have no idea what these things are, they sound very cute though).  The falafel was small and it didn't remind me of falafel. It was ok. Is it supposed to be that small and dry? I honestly didn't know which was the falafel but my better half pointed it out to me. I just eat. It was the size of a giant Walnut. The hummus was ok. The plate came with yogurt, Greek \"yoghurt\" that is. I think it had olive oil in it as it was green. (That or my yogurt was crying green.) Greek yogurt is so special that they included a H in it. The rice that came with the steak was tasty. It was more yellow than I was so I assume it must've had butter all over it? A salad came with 3 of the entrees. It was good, it had feta cheese in it? Really Mediterranean olives that were tart enough to make Stevie Wonder see for a second. It was a nice small salad. The pastry looking baked things were nice and flaky. The pasticcio was a lasagna it turns out. Basically cheese on top and macaroni on the bottom that's been impregnated with meat all swimming in a nice tomato sauce. It was good.  By 7pm there was a line that stretched from the counter to the door. Now this isn't Katz's Deli kind of snaked line but it was long, then again there's only maybe 6 small tables inside. If they sold pizza, I'd have to go outside to eat a Large pizza.  The girls were nice and friendly and brought out the food fast and cleaned up just as fast. They cleared the table for us before bringing out the baklava dessert that was drizzled in honey. Yes, it was sugar on sugar on honey. If it was any sweeter, Shirley Temple would've been a penniless Vaudeville player (I am a history buff). So if you are in the hood, want friendly and fast service with a small neighborhood feel restaurant, stop in and see The Good Greek. (Yes, I said good not great.",

We came at 4:45 and I sent my son to get our food, they took my son's pay but did not give him a receipt and told him we had to wait another 10 mins. after the 10 mins, it yet was still not ready, I was furious, I finally went inside to see what was the hold up, and they said that they didn't want to serve raw pork. like are you serious?, Who does that! I finally got everything by 5:05. If I knew it would take more than 30 mins to cook my dry pork chop, I would've chose another place to eat. They also need to stop telling people that it would take 10-15 mins, when it take 30 or more minutes.   P.S. This is the first time I've ever written a review on a restaurant because of how many flaws and how much I was disappointed. I didn't enjoy my food because of this, yet this would've never happened if they told the truth of the time.",

Unfortunately and sadly enough, I was too stuffed to finish them. Doesn't mean I didn't keep trying! So many fries and so delicious. The melted cheese on top was perfect.   Might I mention their service was some of the best. The lady at the front is so sweet. I once called and asked if it was possible to make a gyro bowl in  5 minutes and I don't know how they did it, but THEY DID IT! Love this place!!!!!! I give the gyro 5 stars!

The reviews looked good so I went over for lunch. I walked in and the place was nice and clean. It's pretty new with several high tops and many shorter 4 tops. I got in line and ordered a gyro plate, Hummus (togo) and some banana pudding.   Gyro Plate - It was pretty good. I enjoyed the meat and everything was fresh and tasty. Now I'll have to say I enjoyed Ambrosia Cafe MUCH better which is why I gave it 3 and not 4 stars.   Banana Pudding - It wasn't that exciting. There was a  place in Denver that just had the best in the world. It was ok, but I would have liked it to seem like they had put a little more love in it.  Hummus - As always hummus is just awesome. Their pita was soft and yummy. I wish they had given more, but there you have it.   I liked this place but didn't just LOVE it. It's close so there is a chance I'll give it another change and see what else they have to offer.",

They have inside and outside seating which is pretty nice when there's nice weather.   My husband ordered the great Greek gyro. He ordered it as a combo and it included a drink with a side. He picked the feta fries and they were good. He also said he really liked the gyro. It looked full of lamb and yummy!   I ordered a plate with rice, lamb and pita bread. The portion was big and there was food left on my plate when I finished eating. I thought the food was very flavorful and fresh.   We also ordered the dolmas as appetizers and they were pretty good! There were 6 pieces in our order which I think it was more than enough for two people. I do wish they offered a 4 piece for 2 people since we ended up not eating all of them.   I would definitely be back!",

For $12.95 you get two skewers of Marinated Chicken Breast, rice Pilaf or Feta Fries! Yes Feta Fries can you believe it!! check the photo out, they are in no way cheap on the Feta! My entire order came out hot, and ready to eat, the restaurant and it's service second to none. When the suns out you can eat outside or inside either or!  Other great items to try, warm pits bread and hummus $2.00 and Falefel $2.50.. gyros run, chicken $6.95 enjoy all and don't forget the gum after or the mints!! Garlic is life here! Yummmm",

My Husband loves Greek food, so it doesn't take much convincing to get him to take me to dinner here. We traditionally get the gyro plate, which comes with sliced gyro meat, pita bread and your choice of french fries or rice pilaf. I usually get the rice because it's a healthier option and it's very well made.  The restaurant is small and gets crowded. There is no table service - you order at the counter and they will bring your food to you when it's ready. The gyro plate is just $11.95, which is a much better value than many of the other local Greek places we've been to, and in my opinion this food is better. They've been around for a long time, so I'd say they're doing something right!",

Actually, my bf says that he sometimes passes by people picketing a labor dispute here, but I guess those signs don't deter anyone. Like they say, \"there's no such thing as bad publicity...\"  Talking strictly food, I do enjoy ordering from here. Even though the beef/lamb gyro seems to be a customer favorite, I prefer to get the grilled chicken option. The traditional gyro ($6.95) comes with tomatoes/red onions/tzatziki, while the Great Greek gyro ($7.95) includes that plus lettuce and feta. Worth getting the latter. Love me some feta cheese. The traditional plates range from $11.95 to $13.95, which include your choice of protein, along with a Greek side salad, pita bread, and your choice of rice pilaf OR french fries. Plenty, plenty food. I've only bummed off a few bites from my bf's plate, but their rice pilaf's good -- light and lemon-y.  Tip: Order ahead of time online using ChowNow. It'll save you from sitting around and waiting for 20 or so minutes. The first time we went, the poor cashier was handling both for-here and to-go orders, AND bussing the tables.",

I came in and ordered to go, feeling under the weather so I decided to get dinner for my husband and I. After ordering and tipping I found a small table and waited for my order. The Owner/ manager comes over and taps me on my shoulder and asked me to move to a single chair by the door so other customers could sit. Wow! I'm African American and a business owner myself, and that is a complete no! No! There was a gentleman ordering to-go whom sat at a table with four chairs and remained until his order was complete. I wish I could've un-tipped and left! I will never return as well as letting all my friends and family know just how this establishment feels about people of color! I'm more hurt than anything that this type of action is allowed yet still. We are all humans, no matter what color.",

It's a huge bowl of soft, moist rice topped with cucumber salad, tomatoes, lettuce, feta, tzatziki, garbanzo beans, and the perfectly grilled shrimp. It's basically a Greek salad on steroids, with some rice. That shrimp is the bomb dot com, no lie. Grilled and seasoned to herby, lemony perfection. A light but filling meal.  The GREAT GREEK GYRO is also a tasty option- pillowy pita with a good portion of beef-lamb topped with red onion, tomato, feta, and more tzatziki. It's a good gyro, dont get me wrong, but the bowl is a bit more unique. The AVGOLMONO SOUP is a flavorful lemony broth filled with chicken and rice. The version here is tastier than many other places ice tried it, and as a side, the portion is quite large.  I'm not in Henderson often, but when I am, I'll be keeping this place on my radar.",

There is also patio seating that will accommodate once the weather warms up a bit.  I had excellent service.  The gentleman helping us was very helpful since we told him it was our first time in.    I had ordered the grilled garlic shrimp plate.  It was accompanied with feta fries and pita bread.   Delicious!  There were 2 skewers of shrimp with 4 on each.   This was definitely plenty to fill my stomach.  Not to mention the outstanding fries.  This was my first time having these and I love feta cheese.  Yum.   My plate also came with a side salad which I didn't finish.  The dressing was a little bit much and overpowering.  But overall it was great.     I had asked the gentlemen if they had lemon potatoes since they weren't on the menu.   They do!  You just have to ask them to make them.  I might just have to go back soon to try those out!   So the business name fits the review - Great Greek! Opa!",

The feta fries are nicely seasoned and the feta is melted properly and not burnt on top of the fries. It's a small place so it's hard to find a table but the service is good and the workers are nice and helpful. Their rice bowls are good too with good amount of protein and vegetables.

The quality has suffered a little bit (chicken soulvaki tough on a few occasions) but overall it remains a solid place to eat. Us, personally, we've found another Greek place in Henderson that we enjoy a little bit more (I will not disclose the name, because both are very good, and the object is not to take away business from the Great Greek -- because, it is, in fact, great. It just isn't as great as it used to be. And I have to be fair to the original five-star review.   This seems to be somewhat of a regular problem in the valley: places open strong & then cannot deal with the influx of customers.",

The place is family-owned and they extend that family feel to their customers. My husband orders a greek salad but he asks them to leave off the tomatoes and cucumbers. The owner acts like this is fine with her while I stand there and laugh! They are awesome!  They have the best rice that I've ever had. My kids beg to go there and eat some rice.  The pita and hummus is just insane delicious. Whenever we are waiting for our food, they pop over with some warm, fresh pita slices for our children.   The chicken souvlaki plate is my staple there. The chicken is marinated to perfection and the rice and salad accompaniment are the perfect meal!  We've tried the falafel and the texture is perfect. The flavors blend well with the sauce, onions and falafel and it tastes heavenly.  The baklava is the BEST I've ever had!   Wish they had more seating (it's almost always full when we go in to eat). We often take the food to go for this reason.  Don't miss the rice pudding!!!",

There weren't any customers ahead of me so there shouldn't have been any problems. Took about 15 minutes to get my chicken gyro to go. Since I was off I wasn't in a particular rush so I let it slide. Food was still great so I would give it 4 stars.  The third that I went I was around 1:00PM on a Thursday. The lunch rush looked like it was about to end because many people were finishing up there food. I got in an ordered the grilled shrimp plate thinking it shouldn't take so long to make...that is if the kitchen doesn't forget order.   I sat and waited patiently for 25 minutes and noticed people that came in after me after got their food already. Nobody came to check up on my even though I was at the table right in front of the counter. I approached the counter and asked what was going on. The lady working the front looked confused and shouted at the kitchen asking what's taking so long with the order. The slip was still just hanging at the food window untouched. I couldn't wait any longer as I had to get to work and asked for a refund since my food haven't even been started yet. The lady did not even say sorry and just kept shaking her head at me as she voided my transaction.  Maybe back of the house were new? I don't know, but I was not treated very well by the front of the house. Maybe I'll try this place again later, but it's going be a long while before I come back.",

Then you get a choice between fries or rice. And they give you so much Gyro lamb and beef.   And it was really delicious.  The girl working the counter was very friendly. Restaurant was clean and so was the bathroom.   I live about 15-20 minutes from here but I will definitely be back again.",

You know you've made a good lunch choice when there are police officers eating at the restaurant as well - they always know where to go for food with a great value. We tried chicken soup, dalmades and a salad. The salad was amazing, definitely try it with the falafel or chicken, comes with a couple pieces of warm pita. The dalmades, do they make them fresh? Because it sure tasted like it, comes with 6 pieces and a wedge of lemon. The soup is a little strange, it doesn't know whether it wants to be chicken-based broth or a cream-based, but very citrus-y and refreshing, so I let that slide.   Basically, a great place for a quick lunch, it's very clean and as usual with restaurants in Henderson, NV, tons and tons of parking.",

Yes it is busy and crowded, but that's how you know it's a really yummy place. I'd wait any day because it's worth it. You have to try the RICE PUDDING. Seriously amazing. The service is great and the people working there really make you feel at home and try to accommodate you wherever they can. I laugh at reviews that say\"it needed a bit more salt\" or the pita was a bit too soft? If you are that picky you should dine at 5 star restaurants. It's a mom and pop place( family owned) people. Geez....trust me try this place. You won't regret it.",

We are a family of 5 and we always have tons of leftovers. My only complaint would be the small dining area. It's pretty small and there aren't too many options for parties of 3 or more. We have had to leave several times because there was nowhere to sit. Not much they can do about that since a crowd means customers, and they can't exactly make more room. Overall, fantastic food, and great service. I dream about the feta fries.",

Ok we are creatures of habit but when you find what is exceptional why order anything else. The side salad with grilled chicken is huge. The sandwich's are delicious and large portions. If you don't experience the feta fries you are missing out.  Lunch time is very busy which to me is a good thing, it means they serve great food. Just call ahead an order, they open at 11am and we call for a pick up time an it is always ready. They have a nice patio when it is not too hot.

I was surprised how fresh everything was considering we went before closing time. The lamb was wonderful tender and full of flavor, the salad dressing was so good even my 11 year old loved it, and the tzaziki was so delicious and refreshing. The fries was a huge hit with all of us especially my 4 year old son. We have baklava which was good, but a bit stale considering it was sitting for the whole day. The Shamali wasn't to my liking, but it was sitting all day also. I really wanted to try the Yia Yia's rice pudding after reading all of the reviews, but she said they sold out.

    "text": "Who needs a Fat or Mad Greek when you can have a Great Greek. The Great Greek really does hit the nail on the head. What was so great about my meal? Everything, start to finish. It was a completely enjoyable experience.   Dinner with fellow Yelpers, Judd and Lynn L., put this place on my bookmarks and it was about time to pay them a visit. With two other Greek food lovers in toe, we came out to try as much as possible. One Mezze Plate, Two Beef Slouvaki Plates, two fountain drink, one bottled water, Rice Pudding, a Baklava, and two secret Greek Coffees (explanation later on) cost a little under $50. There was even left over after I tried to cram as much in as possible. As I write, I lay in bed in a semi-comatose state.   The Mezze Plate is a combination of vegetarian favorites; spanakopita, two dolmas, hummus, pita bread, tsaziki sauce, and two falafels. The puffed pastry was flaky, buttery, and filled with spinach and cheese. The falafels were crispy on the outside and light inside creating the perfect combination. The Slouvaki Plate boasted the most tender and juicy beef. They were drool worthy at medium rare and the juices oozed into the rice. Taste bud overload! With the second plate there is an option to pick between three different sides; rice, fries, and Greek salad. The gentleman behind the register gave us all salads on top of one rice and one order fries. The guest service is amazingly friendly. We were continuously checked upon during dinner as well.   After our meal, one of my friends pushed me to ask about coffee. It is not listed on the menu, but it could not hurt to ask. The same guy who took our order made a joke that it was on their secret menu and it was no problem to make. Now to desserts! The Rice Pudding is thick and rich. The Baklava had great depth and not too sweet. They are definitely one of the best Greek restaurants in town. On the way out, we even got a warm farewell. Thorough is a good way to describe the service.",

Don't know how I missed this place in the past. Arrived on a Saturday night close to closing time and was completely expecting some unhappy folks sorry to see me walk in the door. Much to my pleasant surprise I was genuinely greeted with a very pleasant lady whom I later found out was the owner. Spoke with the owner briefly and felt right at home. AT first glance it's easy to see they have good business sense shown by the fact that no corners were cut. The restaurant s done well, super clean and well kept. Even the business cards and brochures were well done, they even have a well made webpage....sorry but these things matter to me.  On to the more important things, the food! Outstanding food for a decent price. I ordered the Yia Yia Pasticcio, a very tasty pasta caserole with a very tasty Bechamel that is served with a side Greek Salad that eats like a meal itself. Also ordered The Athenian Burger that was topped with Feta and Tzaziki that didn't over power the burger but complemented the meat and allowing it to stand on it's own. Our final dish was the Chicken Santorini Sandwhich. The chicken breast used in this sandwhich does not seem to be of the food distribution variety. The Chicken was very moist and tender and was perfectly matched with  the fresh tomatoes and spinach.  Everything was homemade, fresh and made to order. Absolutely would recomend this place to anyone seeking a nice Greek meal kicked up a few notches.",

We had to wait about 15 minutes for a table to open up. The interior of the restaurant itself was pretty cramped. The service was alright - we ordered at the counter, and the staff came around to clear off tables every once in a while. The ambience was very similar to that of a well maintained fast food restaurant.   I ordered the rice bowl with falafel. It was a huge bowl, and the vegetables in it were very fresh. There wasn't as much rice pilaf as I assumed there would be, but they say when you assume, \"you make an ass out of u and me.\" The rice pilaf was slightly salty and it added more flavor to the bowl (which was extremely reminiscent of a salad). The falafel was flavorful, although the middle was a little mushy.   Overall, the bowl was really good, healthy, and filling. I believe it was about $11, which I thought was a fair price. I would definitely recommend this place yes",

Portions are very generous - one of their rice bowls (comes with veggies and your choice of meat) can easily feed me and the 2 li'l kids. Same goes for the dolmades. I've noticed other places shrinking their portions, some all the way down to 3 in a serving! The Great Greek still offers 6 good-sized dolmades in a serving, and they're delicious. Prices are reasonable, about $10 for the signature rice bowl, similar for a gyro meal with fries and drink. Bonuses for being family-owned and having a nice patio.",

Let's just say, I was not disappointed! Not only was the service great and very friendly, but the food lived up to the expectations.  The food was definitely authentic but it was also very fresh. Mediterranean food can lean towards the heavy side, what with all the gyro, tzatziki, and rice, but even with those delicious ingredients it did not weigh me down. I got a Gyro wrap that had fresh lettuce, tomato, tzatziki, and feta, as well as a bowl of rice on the side. My fiance got a \"Rice bowl\" which is essentially a large salad with a scoop of rice dolloped in the middle, topped with cucumber, tzatziki, tomato, meat and feta. We were both really impressed!   The service was on point; though there were few tables in the restaurant and it wasn't a sit-down restaurant, the staff was very knowledgeable regarding who was sitting where and which group of people got the next table. As someone who has dealt with trying to find an open table in a busy restaurant, this was very refreshing to see! Seriously, the staff was great.   I would definitely go back if I find myself in Henderson again!",

What you pay fpr the amount is draw dropping! They give you so much for next to nothing!!! Their feta cheese is tangy with a slight sweet bite and whether it comes on their feta fries, new favorite way to eat french fries fyi, on their Greek side salads, you cannot go wrong. And one of my absolute favorite things is that you leave full, but it ismt a heacy I need to be rolled out of here full, it is a healthy full where you know you ate good food that is good for you!! I gained a new favorite restaurant tonight and am keeping my fingers, eyes, tongue, toes, everything crossed until they bring one of these restaurants to St. George!",

Went on Saturday 2-6-16 at 12PM and placed a to-go order.  $32.20 got me a greek salad bowl with chicken, a greek salad wrap, and some goodies for my baby boy.  After about thirty minutes and watching many who came in after me receive their food I went to the front counter to see what was going on.  I think they lost my order to be honest but shortly after that they had my food bagged up for me and I was on my way.  They were nice enough to give me a free baklava for the inconvenience.  COOL!  .  $10.95 Greek salad rice bowl comes with your choice of meat (I chose chicken), rice pilaf, lettuce, tomatoes, red onions, cucumbers, garbanzo beans, kalamata olives, feta cheese, and tzaziki sauce, though I received no tzaziki sauce.  Unfortunately I didn't notice the tzaziki sauce was missing until I was already home.   It was still pretty tasty, however.  The rice was cooked well, the chicken was nice and tender, and the salad was delicious even without any dressing. For some reason there was half an avocado on it which is not on the menu and I didn't ask for it.   .  $7.95 Greek salad wrap comes with lettuce, tomatoes, red onions, cucumbers, garbanzo beans, kalamata olives, feta cheese, tazaziki sauce and is wrapped up in a grilled tortilla.  My husband inhaled it and said it was delicious.   .  I didn't like having to wait so long and they kinda screwed up my order but the food is delicious and they gave me a free baklava...soo.....4 stars I guess.  I definitely want to come back and try the feta fries!",

They make their pita in house and it was DELICIOUS. I wish I saved room because their baklava looked to DIE FOR. Do yourself a favor and eat here.",

A lot of their business was \"to go\" so the restaurant seemed slow, but there was food being carried out continually and they were cranking it out. I got the Australian lamb Souvlaki dinner plate with Feta fries and small salad to start. Too much for for one person but it was so good I couldn't stop eating",

I like them both equally so I figured they both deserve equal reviews (with just some very slight/minor differences).   I rarely eat out for Greek food as I can prepare them myself but when I crave souvlakia, gyros kai pites during tempelikes meres, they are one of the only two places I go to  (the other one being Meraki on Rainbow which is close to work).  I fly to Greece once a year being a Greek resident,  and as such I can vouch for their food as the closest to the real thing (especially how they season their proteins).  I just wish they would use a tad more greek rigani and for their horiatiki, maybe serve thick feta slices instead of the (I guess Athen's or President brand?) feta crumbles.  But hey, am not complaining, re!   Their prices are reasonable, their menu offering is just about right and the staff are very friendly (I also wish they'd greet and say bye to customers in ellhnika:   \"Yasas!!!!\" .............. Ti nomizete?).    Bravo, paidia!  Tha se dw syntoma!",

Also, they put the tzatziki sauce on the sandwich for you, so if you're someone who doesn't like a lot, make sure you ask for it on the side.",

I cannot express enough how good the food is here.  The rice pilaf, the rice is loose and flavorful and filling.  The spanakopita is fluffy and dense at the same time (yeah, I don't how that happens, but yes, just yes).  The souvlaki, oh, hello super flavorful and rich meatiness on a skewer.  The salad, there is something addictive about the dressing, and I really appreciate the olives having the pit.  The gyro, well, this is how most people judge a Greek place, and I can say that it is flavorful (everything in this place is flavorful, you cannot go wrong), sliced at just the right thickness, and just works so well with the tzaziki, vegetables, and pita.    Oh and the shamali, dense poundcake like with an orange infused in it, a great way to end a meal.   I have only eaten on carryout, so I can't speak for the waitstaff, but the lady at the register, she is such a welcoming and kind person.

As we entered it was a little busy so we grabbed a table and before we could even sit down this young girl that works in the front came over and said \"you can't sit there you have to order your food first and then you can sit.\" WTH?  First of all, say \"Hello\" and greet your customers with a damn smile not your rude attitude. Secondly, we did order our food! Don't go jumping to conclusions and assume things....after all, you know what they say about assumptions. I'd recommend you learn some manners!   With that being said, we did NOT end up staying (I don't think anyone would after being treated so rude)  we ended up just taking our lunch to go.

On this visit Joel and I both had the Great Greek Gyro with beef and lamb. We also shared some Feta Fries. Definitely spend the extra fifty cents for the fries. They are crispy, tangy and cheesy. Perfect combo! The Gyro was huge and piled with meat. It also had a generous helping of taziki sauce. I looooved their pita bread. I would be happy just having that and some hummus. Which I can't wait to try next time.  If you have a hankering for some seriously excellent Greek food the Great Greek should be your first stop in Henderson.",

    "text": "This place is AMAZING. The reviews are on point. My friend and I having never been, both got the Great Greek chicken bowl based on the reviews, and we LOVED it. The bowls come with rice pilaf which I normally don't care for, feta cheese, diced tomatoes, garbanzo beans, a little lettuce, cucumbers, olives and 5 pieces of delicious chicken. Everything was tossed in a light lemony dressing. They also give you a cup of really good and flavorful tzatziki sauce on the side. The flavors, I can't even describe how good they were. Everything just melded together perfectly. I have been talking about this dish since I left, and I can't wait to go back and try some other items. My friend and I also split and order of feta fries, which were really yummy. I love to dip the fries into the tzatziki sauce for an added flavor bonus.   This is a family owned business and everyone I encountered was super friendly. The place is small, with maybe 10 or so tables inside, but they do have a few extra tables outside on the patio. I just wish this place were closer to me, I would be here often.",

    "text": "The Skinny:  satisfying meals but the overall execution falls short on a few items(3), service: friendly for such a busy place (4), value: it's okay but nothing I would go out of my way for (3).  Craving some Greek food,  we schlepped it over to Henderson to give the Great Greek a try.   First of all, the joint is completely packed during Saturday lunch hours. It is good that the restaurant has counter service because every table is occupied. At the least, you can place your order while waiting for a table to free up. Luckily turnover for tables is relatively quick and the staff clean the tables promptly. I could also see the restaurant does a brisk takeout business which also bodes well.   We placed a order for a chicken souvlaki plate($11.95),  a gyros traditional sandwich combo (with their soup and a drink; $6.95 sandwich + $2.95 combo price), and a appetizer size hummus ($3.95).   The hummus was pretty delicious although it could have used a nice squeeze of lemon to really round out the flavor. The only thing is that the pita served was a little too soft (although served warm) which made dipping difficult. In addition,  we could have used a bit more pita to use for dipping.   The combo sized avgolemeno (lemon, egg, chicken rice soup) soup was very generous in terms of portion size not to mention filling. I found a tinge too salty for my palate and again it needed a bit more lemon to brighten up the taste. Overall,  the soup was just okay for me and I wouldn't order it again.   The chicken souvlaki plate was also quite generous. Served with a sizable Greek salad,  it comes with 2 skewers,  pita,  tzatziki and a choice of rice or fries.  The chicken souvlaki was a trifle dry and a bit too salty. Flavorless, it didn't have that lemony garlicky oregano punch that I normally associate with a kickass souvlaki. I don't think I would order this again.  The Greek salad was very fresh and the dressing was perfect. I also loved their tzakiki which was quite flavorful. Fries were okay.   The traditional beef/lamp gyros was very large and packed with meat. The spicing of the meat was good however it lacked that last bit of caramelization to make it the perfect sandwich.   Overall,  we were stuffed to the gills after all the things we ordered. Some of the items were great,  others were a pass.  Given our experience,  this joint rates a 3 starred review.",

    "text": "It's Friday at approximately 5:30pm. The place was packed and there was a line. It went relatively fast tho. Place is clean, and bright and had pretty pictures of Greece on the wall.   I ordered the Greek salad with a skewer of grilled shrimp, for myself. For my daughter, Greek salad Wrap w/Shrimp Combo ( Regular fries and a soda) and to share, an order of Dolmades ( stuffed grape leaves) and an order of baklava.  It was busy, and a bit loud, but none of that stopped the hardworking people behind the counter. They were friendly and knew their stuff. They worked fast, and efficiently getting out orders in great time. Everyone worked like a well oiled machine, no screaming, just head down getting the job done.  Kudos!  I took my order to go, the smell was so enticing I almost wanted to just eat in my car on my way home.  Opening the containers the presentation was 5 star.  Everything looked fresh and appealing, with a spring of parsley for an added touch  The homemade salad dressing was sooo fresh!! I could smell each ingredient in it. Just so yummy!  The shrimp were plump and  were grilled perfectly! Not over done or hard in anyway.   I am not a huge dill fan, and many times I find restaurants over do it when they put it in the tzaziki, not here!! The flavor was exactly what I have been looking for. So refreshing.  The Dolmades were just as good too. I could eat them all day.  Baklava was not the best I have ever had, a little on the drier side, but I did like it A LOT.  I like that they chopped the nuts finer than I'm used to.  My daughter loved her wrap and even the fries they use are really good. Other than the occasion joyous moan of happiness  and a \"This is soo bomb\"  I don't think we said a word to each other while we ate.  I wanted to devour it, but savor it all at the same time. I would have licked the container clean, but I used the warm, soft pita to sop up the dressing.   The bill was a lil over $30 for 2 people, not too bad for fresh food.   5 stars for food and service. But it is a bit smaller, and a bit too loud, but that might not bother others.   Anyway, TRY it! I can't wait to go back and try every single item on the menu. The menu is a not overly made, you don't have to look through a 100 items to figure what you want. It's easy to read, and will cut down on the time of making a decision. Love that!",

It came tossed with a Mediterranean vinaigrette dressing, the standard veggies, a generous portion of feta cheese, and a side of delicious tzatziki sauce with a full serving of pita bread cut into quarters.  The salad was perfect.  If I could say anything constructive; I wish it came with kalamata olives.  I paid about $14.00 with a drink, which is about the going rate these days.I saw the Gyros coming out of the kitchen and they were huge!!  If you are coming during the lunch rush, plan on sitting out on the patio in the hot Las Vegas heat or just order \"togo\" or \"pick-up\" via their website.(<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thegreatgrill.com&s=81c63b2828122df63ec42a913ea3672e3502e0ec9b7fe4a8e2a5273f4e4bea2e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">thegreatgrill.com</a>) This place is busy; which is a good sign for the freshest ingredients but not so good for seating. Inside the restaurant, they have four 4 tables that seat four and 4 tables that seat two which means the inside seating capacity is only 24. The patio has 4 tables which seat four each. Rents are high these days not to mention the common area maintenance fee that they have to pay, so I totally understand the small restaurant foot print.  The staff is super friendly, efficient and the restaurant is super clean .  I highly recommend this place. You will not be disappointing.",

We have been going for almost 8 years, and have never been disappointed by the food or service, even when they are slammed busy. The greek salad with gyro is possibly my favorite dish in the world. My husbands mother, who lived in Greece, agrees that this is as authentic and delicious as it gets. Please try the hummus and dolmas as an appetizer! The great Greek bowl with grilled salmon is to die for, and again, the gyro meat is the best I've ever had. If you have a sweet tooth, the baklava will knock your socks off!",

    "text": "I've hit this joint twice and, yes, it is very, very tasty Greek fast-casual food. But you knew that already from all the five-star reviews, eh?  The menu is a line-up of all the usual suspects: Gyros, salad with Greek dressing, pita tips, feta fries, baklava, souvlaki, falafel, pastitsio. Everything I've had is heavenly.  Parking/access is sort of odd; once off Warm Springs, you have to sort of wiggle your way back to it, behind a Jason's Deli. But it's worth it.  A wee bit more pricey that other similar venues I've experienced. And a bit shy, portion-wise. And from that, my one-star ding. But the quality IS there.  The last couple of months, I've noticed a big banner right out on Warm Springs, manned by several folks reading \"Labor Dispute with The Great Greek.\" I am OK with collective bargaining, in that it's a big part of how things are done here in Vegas. But since I don't see any Culinary 226 references on the signage, I am not sure what these (likely) former at-will employees are protesting exactly. Because their signage really doesn't say.  Anyway, if you are troubled by scabbing across a picket-line (of sorts), you have been forewarned.  UPDATE (from current owner Nick Della Penna, quoting his comment below): \"The picketing is from the Carpenters Union due to the construction of our second location on Blue Diamond and Decatur.  Rest assured that the staff at Warm Springs is happy with their working conditions and will take great care of you.\"  [ NOTE: The Great Greek's original Greek-Armenian founder Jerry Gorumian sold the Henderson venue to Mr. Della Penna in January, 2016. ]",

    "text": "I found The Great Greek through searching Yelp. Saw the amazing reviews and thought it should be pretty great if everyone else thinks so!  Pulled up and there's a cool patio area for outside seating. The restaurant was busy both inside and out, although a small space overall.   I told the cashier that it was my first time and asked what they are famous for. He recommended me to get the Gyro and showed me the different plate options. I went with the platter which includes the Gyro, rice or feta fries, a Greek salad and a drink.  I decided on the feta fries because...well, why the hell not!!! :). My total was somewhere around $12.00. I felt it was a great deal for all of the food I was getting!   As I was waiting for my food I asked about the baklava and if it was any good. He said that he would give me a free one as he knows I will be back again after I eat their food.  Hmmmmm...ok!  I'll take the bribe!!!   I waited about 7 minutes for my food, despite the busy restaurant, and I took my food to go. I didn't get to my destination for about 40 minutes so my food didn't look pretty enough for a photo but MAN!!!  Flavors were delicious!!!  Feta fries were somehow still warm and my gyro was just so good!  Their Greek salad was generous and the dressing was awesome. I wish the kalamata olives were pitted, probably my only complaint.   The baklava was amazing!  And honestly it really did seal the deal for me. I will be back to The Great Greek and I'm looking forward to it!  Already recommended the place to several friends. Overall, great food, awesome service, and nice spot. I look forward to dining in next time.",

The woman who took my order was very friendly and quick. My food was ready promptly with a smile.    We often ate at Jason's Deli right across from them, but I think I might go Greek, try something else, and definitely get the baklava that I resisted getting the first time!

The portions are large and everything tastes fresh.  I have had the gyro plate, falafel pita, and feta fries.  The feta fries are really addicting.  I am normally super picky about falafel and usually only like it if it is homemade.  The falafel here is quite possibly the best I have every tasted, it is flavorful and isn't dry (the problem I have with most places).  My mom came here with me and said it's the best baklava she has ever had.  This is definitely my favorite place to eat in Henderson.  The woman that works the counter (the owner?) is super sweet and friendly on top of it all.  I highly recommend this place to anyone.",

I am admittedly quite picky, you see I've had the real thing in Greece and it was so delicious and effortless that I refuse to settle for fake American alternatives. This is definitely the pinnacle of Greek food in Las Vegas!  This cute little mom and pop shop is spotless. The decor is surprisingly simple with a few Greek finishes. They have the typical menu and are very friendly. I got a traditional beef/lamb gyro and made it a combo to include a greek salad and a drink. The greek salad was delicious. I am not a huge fan of olives and onions, so I gave half of the salad to my husband, but I was sure to clean up the huge chunks of cucumber and a good portion of the lettuce and tomato.   The gyro was gigantic! The meat and the tzatziki sauce were delicious and complimented perfectly by the soft pita bread and the tomato, feta, and lettuce. I couldn't have been happier. While it definitely looked impossible to eat the entire thing, it was exactly what I did. I cleaned my plate and stole a few of my husband's feta fries. The feta fries have melted feta and herbs and were pretty good, but I have definitely had better. Unfortunately, for the amount of cheese on them they didn't have much flavor at all, in fact I had to dip them in ketchup which seemed like a real shame. The fries were rather thick, perhaps it would have been executed better with shoe string style fries. Other than that, this place is fantastic! I am so happy to finally have a good Greek restaurant in town to curb my cravings. I will definitely be back!",

The meat is always perfect, the rice is seasoned just right, and the portion is big enough you can squeeze three meals out of it.   I've also had the gyro and chicken pita sandwiches, but to be honest, I go for the rice bowl everytime. Also, the lady who runs the restaurant is always so nice and attentive. I love eating here.",

First time, I was willing to over look assuming they were behind but this last time it was just ridiculous. They brought out various friends food orders (we were a group of 10) by the time mine came out, they had finished there food and started packing to go. Were talking 30 minutes between their food and mine.   Second thing, I got sick after the last time. I'm talking immediately--which disproves the possibility of me having a simple viral infection or something. Andddd I have a hardy stomach. That never happens to me!

    "text": "I've had this place bookmarked for a long time, but what finally pushed me to go now was a recommendation for their Avgolemono soup. Greek is one of my favorite cuisines since I grew up with gyros, tzatziki, baklava, etc and it can be tough to please (though I don't consider myself an authority on the matter). Either way, I really enjoyed The Great Greek and I just wish it weren't so far away!  I started with Avgolemono ($3.50), a traditional Greek soup made with simple ingredients - chicken broth, egg, lemon, and rice. I had to try The Great Greek Gyros ($7.95): beef & lamb (the other choice is chicken), lettuce, tomato, red onion, feta cheese, and tzatziki all stuffed into a folded fluffy pita. I also ordered a side of Feta Fries ($3).  Side note: You can add Feta Fries and a fountain drink to your sandwich for $3.45. All other combinations (regular fries, rice pilaf, Avgolemono, or Greek salad) plus the fountain drink is just $2.95. I'm not sure how much a drink costs separately, but this is still a great deal!  Gyro is actually the traditional preparation of meat on the iconic vertical spit, but we associate the name with sandwiches since it is typically served as that. Although not the traditional choice of meat in Greece (it's pork), there is a 50-50 combination of beef and lamb that we have come to love in America (also dubbed gyro meat). At least I love it. It's so good. I don't even care that it doesn't resemble either animal or that it falls apart easily. It's delicious. Good Beef & Lamb: Roasted appropriately with a bit of juice, some crust doesn't hurt (yum), and cut about a centimeter thick.   Although their gyro meat didn't have a crust, it was still delicious. I loved the fresh tomato, onion, lettuce, feta, and refreshing tzatziki. The pita was nice as well. The soup was tasty and they generously served a whole pita with it (cut into four slices). The Feta Fries were good, but not amazing. Either way, fabulous meal and good prices! I will definitely try some of their other Greek specialties next time.",

    "text": "YES. Let's get this out of the way: I am born and bred in Astoria, Queens, NY (Greek hub of NY). I'm half Greek. I can tell you about Greek food. Being out here, I didn't expect to find such a great place to eat, but I did, and it was awesome.   The Great Greek is a fast-food, very casual style restaurant that seems popular for both dine-in and take-out. With my family of 5 people, some of us were hungrier than others, so we opted for the Meal #2: 2 dips, 8 pita, 8 dolmades (rice stuffed grape leaves), Greek salad, rice pilaf (or french fries if you want), 8 meat skewers, 4 desserts, and 4 drinks. It was the perfect amount of food.  The grape leaves were tender and flavorful, the salad was huge and modestly dressed (I like a ton of feta, so I wish there was a little more), there was more pita bread than we knew what to do with, but that was chewy and served warm. For dips, we chose hummus and tzatziki. Both were creamy and tasty as heck. It tasted, though, like the tzatziki was made with sour cream rather than Greek yogurt. It lacked the pungent tang I expect, so it had a softer flavor but it's a personal preference. The rice pilaf was perfectly cooked and lightly lemony.   The meat skewers! SO GOOD. We got 4 chicken and 4 steak, cooked medium. Dude, the meat was tender as hell, well-seasoned, and surprisingly juicy. It's the kind of food that makes you wish you were hungrier so you could eat more. We were all so stuffed that we ended up taking the dessert to go - baklava. But later that evening with coffee, it was delicious.  It needs mentioning that the service was incredible. Maybe I'm just used to rude New Yorkers, but the staff here was very friendly and accommodating.   Overall worth driving to for the great food and atmosphere. Man, I have some very exciting leftovers.",

They even fit my order in at the last minute while already having aa bigher cstering order at the same time. That is awesome customer service.

    "text": "Hnmmm.I'm iffy on this one. Borderline 3 to 4 stars.  So, it's windy as all hell and is raining around 745pm when we get there. There are still people in and eating. A young girl with dark hair and glasses takes our order, gives us our drink cup, and our number.  We order 2 gyros ...The beef/lamb combo, and of course, I had to try the feta fries.  Our food comes... and it's neither hot, or cold. Maybe this is how greek gyros are..? I'm not sure. The meat wasn't even warm...  While the meat was amazing, melt in your mouth barely had to chew it....The sauce and the feta was out of this world... It really didn't have any texture. The little mess of lettuce/tomato/onion was practically non existent.  I WOULD BATHE IN THE FETA FRIES. The fries were crunchy, warm, and covered, but not drowning in cheese. My guy and I were practically fighting over them, and I had enough self control to not pick at the lonely cheese left behind on the wax paper.  My guy stepped up and went to the bathroom.  That's how I was able to see what I'm about to explain next.  The younger girl with dark hair and glasses that took our order was wiping tables, when a cook from the back got her attention... He made some sort of hand gesture towards her. She stops wiping down tables, goes to the cooler that has the drinks in it by the register, pulls out a beer, and walks down the hallway.  She opens the door directly at the end of the hallway, and hands off the beer....  Drinking on the job.....? Is that why you are serving cold food?  meh. Maybe it's just me. I wouldn't mind eating here again, but I don't think I'll be driving by wishing I was inside.  3.5 Stars.",

    "text": "When I visited The Great Greek for the first time last week, I was simultaneously irritated and pleased and both for the same reason.  The place was packed.  It is irritating because I hate crowds and I hate waiting.  Pleasing because a crowd like that means this place is doing something right.  Need I say more?  Yes, if I am any sort of worthy Elite ;)  I stood in line for a few minutes to place a take-out order.  I settled upon the Mezze Plate which is Spanikopita (spinach pastry), Dolmades (stuffed grape leaves), Falafel (fried chick pea fritters), tzatziki (cucumber and yoghurt sauce), and hummus (pureed chick pea dip).  This plate also came with a small Greek salad and some pieces of pita bread.  Its kind of a great way to sample a lot of good stuff.  The spanikopita was great.  Super flakey and packed with spinach, one of my personal favorite greens.  The dolmades were good.  They are stuffed with an herbed rice. These appeared to have a ruddy tinge presumably from the herbs and oil used.  Different that what I am used but they were very tastey and I would happily order them again.  The tzatziki sauce was fresh tasting and delicious on both the pita and falafel.  Speaking of falafel, this was probably the best I've had.  It was well seasoned and not at all dry like other examples I've had.  The hummus was good and strong with the taste of garlic and oil.  It made me wish there was more pita to dip in it.  Perhaps my least favorite part of this meal was the Greek salad.  The olives, complete with pits, were great as was the dressing.  But this salad had a particularly strong red onion sliced up in it and the entire salad ended up tasting of onion.  Kind of a turn off for me.  I am picky when it comes to onions and this fell outside of my preferred dose of the root.  Waiting the 15 or so minutes for my food ended up being a sort of treat in itself.  It gave me the opportunity to notice how clean the restaurant was even though every table was being used by some couple, small group or family.  I also took notice of the Greek music playing softly over head.  In those days immediately prior to Christmas, I was feeling overrun by Christmas music.  This was a welcome departure to the seasonal norm even if I understood no words being sung in this ancient language.  I was also able to observe the hard and constant work of this Greek family taking care of who would become extended family simply by walking through the doors.  It was like organized chaos at its finest.",

It's been about a month (6/14/17) but I cannot get out of my mind how rude the guy at the counter was, and his excuse for reacting the way he did was \"I've been here working for over 12hrs\". I wish I had taken his name, but at that point I just wanted to get out of there. I was really looking forward to this place but unfortunately that one person ruined the whole experience.  The restaurant needs more tables and maybe add a drive thru.  The Greek salad was my favorite item on the menu.",

It is by far the best Greek restaurant in Henderson, and I'd argue it may even be the best in Vegas.   I typically order the chicken bowl but also really enjoy when they have lamb on their specials menu (this changes daily which I appreciate because it means the meat is very fresh). The portion is normally large enough that I have enough for a snack later in the day which makes the somewhat high price (in my opinion) worth it. All of the food here is very light and fresh and is a great pick me up after a long stressful day. The service is always incredibly friendly as well. I definitely go there regularly, and look forward to many more meals there.",

The gyro meat is very juicy and flavorful, although if you're watching your sodium intake you may want to pace yourself on the meat. The pita is soft and fresh, and the fries are delicious. Their menu has mostly standard Greek dishes, and my friends always invite me out to eat there. The food is priced in the $10-12 range, but the portions meet expectations.  The staff is very friendly. They would periodically stop by my table to ask if the food was alright and if we'd like anything else. There's no dedicated wait staff, but the service is greatly appreciated.

My party ordered a few different wraps, a rice bowl, a couple salads, and a rice plate.  The base ingredients had flavor beyond what you'd get from your grocery store produce, and that flavor was enhanced by the best yogurt sauce I have had in all my trips to Greek restaurants.  For my own dish, the gyro woke up your taste buds when it hit your tongue.  In short, the Great Greek has a commitment to both price and flavor, something that's not nearly as commonplace as it used to be.",

The gyro was jam packed and the meat popped.  The gentleman running the cash bay was spot on and actually made me feel like they were happy to see us.  Would eat here again and was added into the retinue of restaurants in Henderson.  Super happy.  Pretty fast service also which was surprising for how large an order.",

    "text": "Great food, amazing service!  First time dining here with my boyfriend and they've definitely earned our business. The entire experience was great! Service was very friendly and accommodating. I didn't get the name of our cashier (he sort of looks like Tom Haverford from Parks & Rec), but he made our entire experience very positive and inviting. He had a really friendly and enthusiastic personality that contagiously stuck with us and made our entire experience great. We chose to sit outside the front patio since the weather was really nice.  I ordered the Lamb Souvlaki with Feta Fries and my bf got the Jumbo Shrimp rice bowl. The salad that came with my meal was very light and refreshing. Our food came out shortly after, and our server apologized to us about the wait and gave us complimentary baklava to take home which was unexpected, but very sweet. We personally didn't mind the wait nor did we think too much about it. Our food came out in around 15 minutes after ordering (there was a few people ahead of us also). If that was a long wait, then I wonder how quick they usually bring out food. Back to the food, we loved everything we ordered and the portions are pretty generous. I definitely recommend trying the feta fries, the fries are SO GOOD and crispy! My lamb was slightly over cooked (I wanted Medium), but was still delicious. Shrimp was very large and juicy. In general, Mediterranean food is very light, so not too much to write home about, but it was enjoyable and delicious. If you have the extra stomach, try the baklava as well for dessert. I recommend eating it with vanilla ice cream, it's sort of like a flaky puff pastry with honey and sliced almonds(?) - extremely sweet imo, but vanilla ice cream helps tone it down a bit.  I've worked in the restaurant industry for years so I tend to help tidy up and organise my dirty dishes to make clean up easier for the workers, but one of the cashiers quickly came out and helped me take away the dishes since I think she noticed me doing it. +1 for attentiveness  As it goes- come for the food, stay for the people. Halfway through eating, my boyfriend is already talking about when we should go back. We will definitely be coming back frequently.",

    "text": "One of the best Greek and Mediterranean places in Vegas by far. Ran across this place while losing my paycheck at Sunset Station.  Tucked away in a parking lot, it's a little hard to see or find unless you're really looking for it. There is plenty of parking at theres always a slight line and wait around dinner time. They have about 8 tables inside so it's better to order ahead and pick up.  The food here is well above average. The meat is extremely fresh and all the items on the menu are pretty authentic as far as taste.  Decided to try the lamb kebobs. 2 skewers of marinated lamb chunks, not the ground stuff, served with either rice of fries or for an up charge you can Greek fries, fries with feta. The lamb was succulent and tender. Seasoned perfectly and very juicy. The rice is to die for! Rich buttery taste and seasoned to perfection! They also give you a side salad! Whole combo is a 5/5!  Then we tried the beef kebobs. Didn't do the ground but the chunks as well. Try not to go past a medium when ordering. Smaller pieces tend to dry out. The perfect flavor combination on these skewers!  For dessert try the Greek cookies. Their take on sugar cookies leaves you wanting more and feeling like you were cheated as a child for never having these introduced to you!!  Only gripe is they tend to be temperamental at times. We've had amazing service and then we've had just ok service, all by the same people. But don't let that discourage you! Food is phenomenal!",

We felt like douches but we totally didn't realize that their Sunday hours were earlier.... anywho we planned to get our food to go anyways and staff didn't really seem like it was an issue.  I ordered the shrimp salad bowl and hubby ordered the lamb gyro with feta fries.  Luckily I checked the bag because they almost sent me out the door without any sauce for my bowl.... smh. The guy threw in an \"extra\" for this near miss, but to me you should automatically get two containers anyways- they were both tiny compared to the salad size *cue eye roll*  When we got home, keep in mind we're 5 minutes down the street, I was surprised that the shrimp were basically cold. Maybe that's how it's supposed to be, but I thought they were supposed to be fresh grilled?! They didn't have any olives in the salad, about 3 bites of rice, feta was barely there.... nothing like the yelp photos.  The same for his gyro- looked nothing like the photos- sauce was super light and so was the feta cheese....   This place isn't cheap, and I have no problem paying for a great meal, but this felt really basic and just blah.... hubby did say his gyro was good, but keep in mind I also had to share my sauce with him because his gyro just didn't have enough fml. I resorted to Caesar dressing instead..... don't know if I'd come back or not....",

I would drive across town for this restaurant, but lucky for me it's around the corner from home. They are awesome in food and service.  We've had a variety of items from the menu and everything is very tasty. My favorite pick is the steak souvlaki plate. There is more than enough food with this dish. It comes with two skewers of tasty steak, a salad, pita, and the choice of rice or fries. I typically choose feta fries because they are crazy delicious. My husband is a fan of the gyro. Another one of my favorites is the pasticcio. You can't really go wrong with their food since everything I've had has been delicious.",

There's indoor and outdoor seating available. You order up front and your food is brought to your table. The line to order moved fairly quickly and we got our food in less than 10 minutes.   We ordered two lamb/beef gyro combos (side & drink) with feta fries ($.50 extra) for about $25. The gyros had lettuce, tomato, red onion, tzatziki sauce, and feta cheese... A LOT of feta cheese. The gyro meat was moist and had good flavor. It was also sliced thicker than I'm used to. The gyros also came with a couple of small pepperoncini peppers.  The feta fries were tasty; battered fries covered in feta and another white cheese (mozzarella?). They were pretty garlicky as well. I wasn't even able to put a dent in the pile of fries as the gyro had me stuffed.   The food was solid, but nothing absolutely amazing. That being said, I would come back if I was in the area or if a companion wanted to go.",

It is setup as a fast food place but the quality of the dishes is of a home made meal. I have had every single item on the menu... Yup every item. My favorite is the beef shish kebob. It is hard to get good lamb in the US so naturally the beef one is better. If you like feta cheese I recommend upgrading your side of fries to feta fries. The place gets busy around lunch time so do not expect to get there and be out in 5min. Good food takes time and the key is having everything made upon order and not a month prior... One overlooked item is Yia yia's Pastitsio and it is amazing!!!",

I haven't had this type of food before so when I saw a lot of things with cucumber and tzaziki onthe menu I knew my order would be customised.

I ordered the Athenian Burger and when the lady said it had the tomatoes, salad, and cheese would all be mixed together in tzaziki I told her to leave all of that salad stuff off and just put feta cheese on my burger. The wait for my burger was long and that was okay but when you bring me a burger that is obviously a frozen patty and put the salad on it that I asked you to leave off something is wrong. I did say something but it would have been a 15 minute wait for a new burger so I just said I would take the salad mixture off of my burger and deal with it. The burger was terrible. Then I tried the Feta Fries that I ordered and hot damn they were good! The fries were great but the gross burger and my lack of taste for cucumbers will not bring me back here.",

The salad wasn't very Greek: a sprinkle of Feta and 2 kalamata olives drenched in a way-too-oily dressing? Come on.  The tzatziki only tasted of yogurt, no other flavors, so thank goodness they had Sriracha.  Fries were standard.  The pita was good.  I didn't get Baklava because it wasn't shiny as all other Baklava I've eaten has been.  The woman at the counter seemed bothered by me despite my 20% tip paying at the counter.  She didn't even give me a water cup.  She just wanted to chat with a couple of regulars.  If you don't know Greek, it'll be bomb.  If you do...this place will disappoint.",

The chicken souvlaki was okay but tasted like it was old. The salad was just plain with some feta cheese and dressing plus this was kinda expensive. You do get a lot of food for the price but you won't eat most of it",

I ordered the Chicken Souvlaki plate with rice. Bascially it's grilled chicked skewers over a bed a rice. It comes with two slices of pita bread and a small greek side salad. With a small drink the whole meal cost maybe $13 which is a little pricey for lunch, but it was defintiely worth it. The chicken was so tender and juicy and the biggest suprise to me was the rice. Usually at most restaurants they just throw some rice on the plate so it looks like you got a lot of food, but oh no, I feel in love with this rice. For some reason the rice had a hint of a lemon flavor and it was just really delicious and comforting. I could have just eaten that rice by itself.   So enough of me gushing about the rice.. but bottom line.. if you're looking for some fresh Greek cooking, come try The Great Greek. You won't be disappointed!",

My wife enjoyed the Chicken Souvlaki and the kids had chicken skewers.  Nobody left the place hungry.  Get there early though because the restaurant isn't very big but it was packed at 6PM on a Tuesday.  We ordered some baklava to go for later that night and it was awesome.  I really like baklava but am often disappointed at restaurants because the phyllo is soft and mushy because it has been sitting around too long.  The phyllo in this baklava was light and crisp and the filling was so sweet, even maybe too sweet if that's possible.  If you are looking for good food in Henderson you can't go wrong with The Great Greek.",

    "text": "On our way to San Diego we stopped for the night in Henderson, NV. A group of 10 of us were lookin for some inexpensive dinner so I hit up yelp. While it was a bit difficult to find even with a GPS, we eventually found it and were not disappointed.   The woman behind the counter was a jovial Greek woman and another Greek man (son I presumed) was running around helping. She expalined the menu and after much deliberation we went with two family dinners for 4, which included a huge gyro, salad, dessert, and a drink for each person all for about $43. Very reasonable. The other two got some sort of salad, one got the shrimp. The portions are large and the gyro was very tender and tasty. It also had feta cheese on top, which was a nice touch. I tried the shrimp, which were easily jumbo shrimp and very flavorful. The gyro was by far the best part of the meal and the feta fries were also very good. We couldn't decide what dessert to order until a lady behind us in line said their rice pudding was delicious. We ordered both the rice pudding and the baklava. Both were very good. I can only take so much sweet, so I couldn't finish the rice pudding but it was very good. The baklava was one of the best I've had. And I've tried my Greek friend's mom's baklava straight from Greece. It had the perfect flakiness and combination of sweet with the nuts. I'm not a huge dessert fan but the baklava and rice pudding I would order again. Definitely a delicious, affordable meal and I will go again when I'm in the area.  Side note they had raspberry iced tea which was a plus if you don't drink soda :)",

The staff was friendly we asked him what we should get and he told us about the chicken bowl. It had everything you could think of in it. Kalamata olives, feta cheese, fresh tomatoes chicken on a skewer, rice and mixed lettuce with a tasty vinaigrette. It was soo good. I recommend you try this place.",

My bf went to the owner and she said, \"must be the wind, so what do you want.\" My bf said I'm not eating this so she said ok and took the salad back and said she would make a small salad for him not even the entree salad he purchased!! Then he asked how come she's keeping the salad back there he returned she said oh she's going to reheat the chicken when the hair was mixed with chicken and the salad. My bf said no he's not eating that and she starts arguing with him and my bf said he wanted a refund. He got the refund. She got upset and better yet she told the chefs to hold on to the salad so yet another customer who orders it would have it! We have been here multiple times and honestly the food isn't as good as it was before and the owner is a ruthless old hag. WILL NEVER RETURN! Unless you want to eat hair and deal with it.",

My mom got the shrimp entree; succulent mild shrimp over rice, topped with a scattering of raisins and sliced almonds, and served with greek salad; it was fantastic. The pita bread was the best we had ever had. Good hummus, too. I tried the famous rice pudding (far too sweet and heavy for me - Paymon's Mediterranean Cafe on Maryland Pkwy has the best) and the baklava (just okay). Staff was entirely Greek; family-owned place, with the requisite blue and white everywhere. Made me smile with the predictability of it all. In a good way. The wife-side of the ownership came by our table and chatted with us; very pleasant. There is another Greek spot very nearby; I had a hard time deciding which to try. It may be good as well, but I'm so glad I picked this one! It's not fancy, but there are tablecloths and they do serve wine and beer, with a couple of imported Greek beers.",

For a quick restaurant type of environment, the service and food quality was amazing! Not to mention that while inside, it had a feeling of community/family, everyone was talking and it felt cozy.  There is a small outdoor patio with nice tables and umbrellas which would make for a great place to grab wine/beer in the evening. They have a decent little selection of each.  An overall great experience, would absolutely recommend to anyone!",

(we sat indoors as it was not) Very casual dining atmosphere.  The food was very good and the price was very reasonable. I had the Gyro sandwich combo with soup and a drink and it filled me up.  The only downside that prevented me from giving 5 stars was that the Baklava that I ordered never came... The brought out all our food except for the baklava but since we were so full we forgot about it until we got back home... so partially our fault too I guess??  Either way, good food, good service, good price = Will be back.  Good to take friends, family, coworkers, and a date.",

Appears to be a family run business and they did a really good job of serving and keeping us happy.  Don't miss this one!!!",

I was so used to going to that other Gyro place on Eastern, but now I realized I settled for mediocre food there. Well Thank you Great Greek and my Yelpers for opening my eyes to what a Gyro should be. The presentation was wrapped in a pretty and neat package. Tender seasoned meat sliced perfect, with a tzatziki sauce that actually has taste (I always thought tzatziki was a bland yogurt sauce) and the freshest feta cheese, lettuce & tomato. Nice touch with the pepperocini on top to add a little zing. Bite then drizzle juice on the gyro. The bread was soft and allowed the gyro meat to shine without getting in the way. The perfect vessle to hold this delicious creation. OPA!! I can't wait to come back!",

Sometimes the food takes awhile like over 20 mins because they are so slammed, and sometimes there's nowhere to sit because it's kind of small and gets easily overcrowded. I wish they had more space and another location on the west side of Henderson. My wife and I love this place and it's probably our favorite food in the whole city. We usually get the bowls with gyro meat. Portions are very generous. Too bad it's always such a long and drawn out event whenever we want to go here. We usually only go if we are in the area and if there's no line out the door.",

Fresh ingredients, good size portions packed full of meat and not just a salad on a pita. Prices are comparable to any other place, but worth every penny. The staff push this place over the top! You can definitely see and feel in their demeanor and attentiveness that they care about their product and are appreciative of your business. Can get packed during peak hours, but worth the wait. Closed on Sunday's, but I'm cool with that. It's sooo good, I'm salivating writing this review!

The lady at the counter is super nice.  After explaining to me the items on the menu, I went with what I know best, the gyro.  I shared the meal with my bf and it actually was enough food.  The gyro was tender and flavorful, the salad consisted of fresh ingredients, the fries were freshly fried.  Definitely a delicious meal.  We will return to try other items on the menu...",

    "text": "The food was tasty.  The atmosphere OK.  Price was reasonable.  The Gyro platter was good.  I thought the sauce was a little bland (could have used more dill and seasoning).  The feta fries were good.  Food easily deserved 3 1/2 or 4 stars.  Customer service pulled them down a star.  The reason:  When they were taking my order, they asked how many were in my party (I was alone) and they told me to sit at a 2 person table (a reasonable request since they were almost full (a testimony to their good food), but when I finished placing my order, only a 4 place table was available (someone had sat down at the place they had pointed out to me).  The only table left was the 4 place table, so I sat there (outside was too hot).  When my food came out, they were clearing a recently vacant 2 seat table and put my food there, and motioned me to re-seat myself.  I felt they could have handled moving me a little better then to put my food at another table.  If they had asked me 1st, it wouldn't have been an issue, but somehow the way it played out without a polite exchange of communications made me feel there was an underlying lack of customer commitment.  I will go back, because the food was good, but hope this review will help them sharpen their customer communications skills.",

Thanks to Yelp I spotted great reviews for this Greek Restaurant which turned out to be across the street. We came to the little restaurant that had some tables inside but chose to sit outside as it was on the cooler side inside. My 2 children ordered the large Greek salads that came with hot, toasted pita wedges. My husband and I each ordered the chicken souvlaki platter that came with small Greek salads, rice pilaf and the pita wedges. The chicken was really flavorful and my picky 17 year old proclaimed, \"that's the best chicken I've ever tasted!\" The salads were delicious and very crisp and fresh! My daughter also ordered a baklava for dessert to eat back at the hotel and it was gobbled up. ( she loved it and normally doesn't like nuts). We loved our meal and wish they were by our home in Phoenix. I also have to add that the woman who took our order was super friendly and cheerful. The food was quickly served nice and hot!",

Personally I prefer Greek Bistro and Great Greek because Kyklos is good and priced around the same as the other two but sits in the Galleria mall so my mindset is fast-food Greek.   Where to start! The hummus and pita was very enjoyable, great flavors and not overpowered with lemon as some other places do. The chicken and steak shewers with rice & salad were incredible. The steak was nice and tender, the rice was perfect and the salad had a perfect blend balsamic vinegar dressing. The chicken gyro was quite tasty but thought it had a tad bit too much tzaziki sauce. I walked away so stuff that I was popping Tums later that night but that experience hasn't prevented me from wanting more. The cashier was incredible, which I'm sure was probably the owner or owner's wife. Oh bring a jacket because I was freezinggggggg while we ate so the food got cold, thus the reason for knockin off a star.  Great place for Greek food but I like how there's the Greek triangle near the Galleria mall. If you don't like this place, try Kyklos in the mall or Greek Bistro by Sunset!",

I was a little worried the fries would be soggy with the added cheese but they were crispy to the last bite. The gyro was warm lamb with cool veggies. A little double flavor with the white sauce on the gyro and feta fries. Knowing that now I may have gone with the falafel. All in all a delightful meal if you have a few minutes to wait for fresh made food in a small restaurant.",

    "text": "This tiny, family-owned & run Greek joint shouldn't be missed if you find yourself anywhere close to Stephanie & Warn Springs. The same family who owns The Fat Greek on the west side also owns this place. The Fat Greek has a larger dining room and includes a bakery counter (the family, as I understand, is actually mostly Armenian and whips up some pretty incredible Armenian baked goods). The Great Greek Grill is a smaller place without the included bakery, but it's clean and light (mirrors along one wall and windows along two other walls help it feel larger & brighter). Service here is always patient and with a smile; you can tell they really care about keeping loyal customers. I can vouch for the fact that their hummus, tzatziki, spanakopita, Greek salad, and chicken souvlaki all have great flavor. I don't like dolmades, so I can't really help you there, though I can tell you these are longer and skinnier than most I've seen/tried. Unlike most Greek joints, this one also offers avgolemono soup, which I enjoyed, but since I don't have too much experience with different incarnations of it yet, I'm not sure how it compares. I love their chicken so much that I haven't tried their actual gyro meat, but nothing I've had there yet has done me wrong.  (Note: Evidently there's a duplicate page out there for this place, listed under its full name, The Great Greek Mediterranean Grill. I'd posted this review under that listing first (there are 5 other people that reviewed under that one), and now I'm posting it here as well.)",

Three of us walked in and saw an open table and one of us sat down.  We were rudely kicked out of that table to accommodate another party that was ordering right a head of us.  One person of that party  had already sat down at another table and they were in the process of ordering.  Our party was in line to order behind them.  The staff RUDELY told us we couldn't sit there because we hadn't yet ordered (as mentioned our party was in line waiting to order next).  Both parties were 3 people and we were told to sit at a small table for 2 so the other party could have the bigger table.  It was made to be a huge rude deal.  I've never been treated so rudely at any restaurant.  If seating is that important here maybe they should get a hostess to seat you.  We walked out and I doubt we will be back.  What a disappointment.  They just lost the 3 of us and all our friends that have been coming here for years!  I see they are building a new restaurant on the SW side and I was going to recommend it to all my friends over there, but not after tonight!",

    "text": "Like Ellie Goulding's song \"Lights,\" Greek food never gets old to me.  On any given day falafels and gyros can keep calling, calling, calling me to lunch or dinner.   Been wanting to try out Great Greek for a while, but it's a little more east than I usually travel.   Tonight I found myself in the area and decided to call in some takeout.  I went with a lamb gyro with feta fries on the side, and asked for a side of falafel because I simply have to try some at every Greek restaurant I go to because it's in the title of my list here on Yelp for Mediterranean eats.  When I arrived the food was ready and waiting for me and I was happy to see Dr. Pepper on the list of fountain drink options because as you may know, Dr. Pepper is the unofficial non-alcoholic nectar of the Gods.    I did have to drive about 20 minutes until I got home, so please take that into consideration for the food review that follows.  I immediately went for some feta fries which were pretty standard french fries covered in, you guessed it, feta cheese.  Because of the drive, the feta cheese had sort of started to congeal a little, but it had no effect on the taste and I found them delicious.   I will say for a quick comparison that I do prefer Yanni's Gyros fries where he adds garlic, feta and hot sauce, but I digress.  Then came the gyro.  With the first bite I knew it was something special.  Tender, flavorful gyro meat with the standard lettuce tomato and onion SMOTHERED in tzatziki and feta.   I think it had more of these two ingredients than any gyro I've had elsewhere, and to me that was a good thing.  Between the fries and the gyro the meal was fetariffic!  Sorry about that.  Lastly I tried some of the side of falafel, and was a little disappointed in those.  They weren't bad by any means, but I feel like I've had better in many places like Hedary's and the Fat Greek for example.  The texture was good, but it just wasn't as flavorful as I like.  Prices were reasonable and service was friendly and efficient.  If Great Greek were closer to my work or home I'd make it a regular visit, but for now it will remain a solid choice when I'm in the area (which is almost never.  Step your game up Sunset Station!)",

By 11:30 there wasn't a seat to be had. It's a small place with limited seating but the food is outstanding. We ordered hummus, Gyros and a baklava. The staff was friendly and attentive. They acknowledged by name several regulars who came in. The hummus was delicious. I have never had a better Gyro. The taste of the meat was so flavorful and abundant. Feeling bad for the standing room only crowd, I suggested we take the baklava home for later.  We were stuffed from all the other food. We got home and I couldn't wait any longer to dig into the baklava. It's by far the freshest most tasty baklava I have ever had. It nearly sent me into a sugar coma but it was well worth it.  We will be back in April and will be ordering lunch and dinner a few times.",

It had what looked like pica digalo. Just tiny chopped up tomatoes with looked like cilantro in it. It was still tasty though.  Last complaint is they cut the pita in half. This makes it really hard to eat. But it was still good",

I ordered the Rice Plate and chose chicken as my meat. Glad I did! Everything is so flavorful!! I thought how good could can rice taste, it's rice? WRONG! It's so good!! They put a scoop of rice in the middle, salad along the outer edges and your choice of meat on top. It is the most favorable Greek food I've ever had! Everything compliments each other. Not a fan of garbanzo beans which are in the salad, funny? I don't mind them! All the flavors compliment each other! Oh I will be back! Yum!!!!",

She brought my friends food and then we waited another 5 minutes for my meatless, cold salad wrap..  She dropped off a piece of baklava without a word. Sorry to say, not a big fan of nuts. Our fries with feta came next (we have now been here for almost 30 minutes) fries are plain, no cheese.  Won't be back, definitely won't recommend",

I was in the mood for Moussaka but had to settle for the grilled shrimp with extra Spanakopita, while my friend had the Beef Souvlaki (grilled skewer).  We were extremely happy with EVERYTHING.    The Spanakopita was light and satisfying, the skewers (esp the shrimp) were cooked perfectly, and the accompanying sides were all faultless... from the fries, tasty rice pilaf, salad to the pita and tatziki (yogurt dipping sauce with cucumber).  These large, composed plates are a treat, an in-between fast food and fine dining.  They have great service and sell wine here too!  So if you're craving for great greek grub, the drive to Henderson will be worth it.",

That said, I didn't expect world-class Greek and a wine list.  I ordered the Greek bowl with gyro meat, hubby ordered the gyro with side salad. Then, we sat down to wait.  After a brief wait, we got our order of dolmathes. They were skinny and soaked in oil and, frankly, not that good. But, I'm addicted to Mezze Foods' dolmas, so it would take a miracle to find any worth comparison.  We sipped iced tea and proceeded to wait for dinner.  And wait...  And wait...  And watch both parties that came after us get served...  And wait...  And, just as I heard my husband's stomach actually complain louder than he was whining, the food came.  Lots of it. Fresh and tasty. Absolutely no complaints about food quality - yummy. Plenty of feta and meat, nice crunchy greens, good dressing.  One thing I will say, particularly to those who complained of \"too much\" cheese on their food: No. Such. Thing. Weirdos. Loved that my salad was nice and cheesy, much like my hubby. :)   But, worth the wait? Meh.",

    "text": "Sadly, my knowledge of Greek food comes from My Big Fat Greek Wedding and a killer hangover from a few too many shots of cheap ouzo and pine sap Retsina to wash down \"Greek\" takeout in Hawaii.   With those credentials to back me, here goes.  The Great Greek makes very good, tasty Greek food.  Simply put, proteins are juicy and properly cooked, breads are fresh, everything is flavored with fresh herbs and well seasoned.    Dolmades (grape leaves stuffed with rice dill and other herbs) a real surprise.  Dense, moist and herbaceous, the leaves so tender you can eat them.  Lamb and beef gyro and grilled chicken gyro are real standout.  Juicy, well seasoned, sliced beef and lamb or chunks of chicken , atop simple veg, bathed in a zesty tzaziki, piled with a tart goat milk ricotta all enveloped by a fresh, warm, fluffy pita.  Grilled steak souvlaki, no complaints.  Deeply flavored, juicy tenderloin on skewers over a fluffy rice pilaf.  A squeeze of fresh lemon to brighten up the dish.   Done.    Finally, desert; baklava.  What's not to love, flaky filo, butter, sugar, walnuts, cinnamon all bathed in honey.  Friendly counter service.  Clean dining area.  Reasonable prices.  Poker Pro Tip:  Give a bud who lives in the area a ride to the WSOP. On the way stop for lunch.  For days after \"hey, you want me to stop at that Greek place and get you something?\"  Heck yeah!  Ponder if you must, is the food so good because it's different from our norm or is it the difference from its norm that makes it delicious?  It's all Greek to me.",

While he was in line to order our food I sat at the only table that was available, then one of the employees came up to the table and told me I could not sit there and that I had to give it up for the people who ordered before me. Is that correct? Can they order people not to sit at a table? In addition to being hungry, we were now upset and walked out. I think this was rude and uncalled for. I've never experienced such a thing at other restaurants. This is unfortunate because we have eaten there before and enjoyed the food but this experience has discouraged us from returning.",

It's topped with lettuce, tomatoes, red onions and a generous amount of tzatziki. The gyro holds well if you order to go, the fries not so much. The staff is very nice and the service is fast.",

    "text": "Finally...a \"good\" Greek restaurant on this side of town!!! I met a friend there for lunch today because it was highly recommended. Looking at the menu, I knew I was in trouble and if I liked the food, would probably have to come back at least 20 times.   I ordered the avgolemono soup and the dolmathes. Both were very good. The soup was similar to my dad's, it has the right amount of lemon, not too much chicken and not too watery, not too thick...just right. The dolmathes were tasty and easy to eat. They weren't too vinegary like some places and the grape leaves were nice and fresh where some places are all tough and stringy. I also tried my friend's spanakopita, which was by far much better than other Greek places around here. Not only is the food better, but the prices are also much better than the other Greek places out here. Being Greek, I'm obviously picky about my Greek food. Next time I come here, I'll try the pastitsio, then I'm trying a burger because the Greeks make the best burgers and we need more good burger joints out here.  The service is very good. They are very friendly and yes, when my friend at the table behind me dropped his napkin, the owner was immediately over with a replacement. Now that's service.",

I really enjoyed the quality of the food. I ended up coming back the next day and ordering the falafel and tzakiki sauce. The falafels were some of the best I've tasted no exaggeration and the sauce actually came with a pity bread which the menu doesn't mention but was a pleasant surprise so I had some pita falafel sandwiches with tzakiki sauce fantastic. I will try everything on the menu eventually and I will also bring my girl here cause she loves this type of food.

    "text": "It Really Is The Great Greek   My husband surprised me one day when he said he wanted Greek food. I couldn't argue with him cause the idea sounded great to me! When we arrived at The Great Greek the little restaurant was very clean, inviting and the help was exceptional!! The place was a little busy but nothing to extreme.  We ordered some Dolmades (grape leaves stuffed with seasoned rice and fresh herbs). These dolmades are some of the best around. The grape leaves were fresh, with a little crisp to them. The rice and herbs were well balanced. They came cold, even tho I prefer mine a little warm, but after a few minutes they were gone so it didn't matter! We also got a side of Hummus (garbanzo beans crushed with garlic, lemon juice and some olive oil). It wasn't bad but I've had better. For the meal we got a Falafel Pita (stuffed with falafel, hummus, lettuce, red onions, tomatoes and mint yogurt sauce, served with a side Greek salad) and a Gyro Plate (tender slices of Gyro with tzaziki sauce, pita, rice pilaf and a side Greek Salad). The Falafel was so soft and done perfect! I couldn't have wanted a better falafel! The combination of the falafel and all the other ingredients made for a healthy satisfying meal. My husband said the Gyro plate was really good as well. The meat was seasoned well! Although, I didn't try the meat, the rice was very tasty! To finish up the meal we got some Baklava (layers of filo dough, walnuts and cinnamon with honey). Seriously, the best baklava I have ever had...in my life!!! I would be very disappointed if I found out that they didn't make this in house. I've had plenty of homemade baklava, which has been very good, but this one tops them all! Overall the food was amazing, fresh and made to order! We have since been back and we will continue to go. So, if you want some great Greek food, head over to The Great Greek!!! You won't be disappointed!  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Finapplesworld.blogspot.com%2F&s=15d1b635954e5eac798122b03763f8ddad710a8edec074dc2339db49c462bfcf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">inapplesworld.blogspot.c...</a>",

    "text": "Gimme a bucket of tsaziki and slather me up!  I have been absolutely craving Greek food for the past few weeks.  Maybe it's the upcoming festival season.  Maybe I'm getting tired of of my wife's cooking.  Uh, maybe I better shut up.  Whatever the impetus, I was determined to give this place a shot.    The lady at the register was really nice, despite having half the dining area overrun by my two monkeys.  They don't have kids meals, which posed a bit of a challenge in ordering, so be advised if you do have kids.  As a workaround, I decided to order the soulvaki plate with one skewer each of chicken and beef, with rice and a salad (about $11).  My wife opted for a gyro pita ($7.50) combo that came with fries (hey, don't judge) and a drink (add $2.50 for the combo).  +1 drink for me and our total was just under $25.    The food came out reasonably quick and smelled delicious.  The salad was fresh and refreshing, with just enough dressing for taste, not drowning in it.  The beef I ordered medium rare and it was cooked perfectly.  Some steakhouses can't even get that right!  I don't know what kind of beef they use, but it was really tender and the seasoning was pitch perfect.  The chicken was also cooked ideally and oozed juices when cut into.  Of the two, the chicken was my favorite - whatever is in the marinade makes it sing.  The skewers sat on a bed of really tasty rice pilaf that seems to have some tang to it.  Add to that some of the best tsaziki sauce I've had and you're in business.  I could have slathered everything with it.    The kids were shoveling my rice and took about a third of my meats, so thinking I would be left hungry, I ended up ordering a third soulvaki chicken skewer ($3) and a side of rice ($2.50).  Of course, as soon as I paid for the extras, my kids say they're full.  Typical.  So what's a dad to do except scarf it all down myself?    Unfortunately, I ran out of tsaziki because I shared it (rare for me) with my wife, who, of course, didn't share any of her gyro pita with me.  But $0.75 for a side?  Yikes!  No matter how good it is, I can't justify paying that much for a small container.  The only thing more disappointing than running out of tsaziki was the fries.  Yeah, I know, who the heck orders fries at a Greek place?  Well, blame it on the kids.  Also, the pitas don't taste home made, but that's not a big deal to me, I'm just giving fair warning if that's a must have for you.  Despite the hardships I experienced, I overcame.  I used some creative ordering, decided never again to share the most cherished items on my plate and made a note to self to always leave the family at home.",

    "text": "I had a chance to try this place out and decided it was well needed.  I ordered a gyro platter, which I figured would give me a solid impression of the overall quality of the food. Their gyro meat is tender and moist, always a good sign for the hungry patron. Diced tomatoes complimented the meat well, which was PLENTIFUL. They served it on that standard white flatbread that you see at a lot of places. Not my favorite choice of bread but it was not problematic. The tasty cucumber yogurt sauce was authentic, as expected. The salad was pretty delish-- it had that ever so tasty olive in it and that yummy vinagrette dressing. Their rice had a nice wholesome taste to it but I wouldn't have minded a bit of extra seasoning in it. The fries were good but also could have benefited from some additional seasoning.  I'm very much looking forward to trying some of their kabob dishes and specialty salads in the near future.  Final verdict: good quality, authentic greek food, served in plentiful portions.",

I am a VERY picky eater and have an allergy to cheese and I feel that they always take that seriously when I tell them No Cheese on anything of mine.  Thank you!  I also can't say enough about how good the food is here too.  I love the chicken kabobs and the shrimp ones are OUT OF THIS WORLD!!!!!  I am a huge fan of their Greek Salad and their gyro meat as well.  We get carryout about 3 times per week and would eat here more often if we could.  :)",

The only thing is the kitchen seems too small for the amount of orders they get.  I have waited more than 30 minutes for my food on more than one occasion.  Beware, they get very busy.  I suspect that people got tired of waiting for their order and started calling in their order, because the entire time you are waiting you see tons of people coming in to pick up their large phone orders to go.  No matter what, the staff has always given nothing but the best service and the food is always consistently good.  I am going to phone in my order from now on instead of popping in for a quick bite, because that is almost never the case here.",

The marinated chicken skewers were d-e-l-i-c-i-o-u-s.....tender, juicy, savory, and just delectable. The rice that came with the chicken was also amazing...buttery, flavorful, and so so good.  It looks like a family run place, and they're very service oriented. Very nice ambiance too--casual and modern, but still inviting enough to stay and eat. Highly recommended!!!",

I had their world famous rice bowl which had generous portions that left me feeling full and satisfied. Their rice isn't typical, and is cooked to form a very soft, tasty texture.

I asked if they could make vegetable skewers & they said they couldn't, while other places like Crazy Pita (even though they don't have veggie options) will normally accommodate me & whip up some veggie-friendly meal. So I will love this place a little bit more when they get some veggie options. So please do!!",

    "text": "I was literally stunned by such a great food in a completely randomly chosen place. On the way back from Hoover Dam, we were looking for something to eat without going into Las Vegas. The photos looked quite promising so we decided to give it a shot.  Now, food is excellent. I mean it. I got falafil plate along with a rice and a side of greek salad. Rice is not overcooked, more on the al dente side, and salad tastes absolutely authentic. Tzatziki sauce is absolutely remarkable, paired perfectly with both my falafil and my gf's shrimps. She got a side of Feta fries, that melted enough to stratch, but did not made fries soggy at the same time; excellent timing.  The only single drawback, the table we choose wasnt clean when we took it, however, I dont think that's something that might affect 5star rating. Although the place is quite small, staff is absolutely dedicated and very friendly. If I was living or working in the area I would definitely visit this place quite often.  Thank you guys!",

For that reason, it takes a little more for your typical Greek place to stand out, especially when it's more of a fast casual order at the counter type of place. I'm happy to report, this place is one of the better ones.  Gyro meat is cut right from the spit and is moist and well seasoned. Pita bread is pillowy soft. The feta fries are incredible, somehow managing to maintain their crispness under a delicious load of melty cheese and spices. Definitely worth ordering.  Unfortunately I didn't get to experience that great customer service everyone seems to be raving about, but the staff was fine and functional. It was busy and they did have someone front of house to make sure the tables were clean and ready for the next customers.  All in all, worth a stop for a casual and tasty meal.",

    "text": "When it comes to Las Vegas, they have no shortage of Mediterranean cuisine on offer, both in and off the Strip. However, when it comes to Greek food in particular, everyone and their mother seems to have their own definition of what's good or not. For me, finding my favorite Greek place came about as a sheer accident -- I was in the area when I found out about the Great Greek back when it opened a few years ago. I stopped in to try the place, and I've been hooked ever since. Needless to say, this is one of my personal favorite restaurants in town, though it's only now that I'm reviewing this place for Yelp.  Ever since that fateful visit, the Great Greek has since expanded to Centennial and West Henderson, though for me the original location behind the Sunset Station has been my go-to spot for Greek food whenever and wherever! During this visit I came with my mother, and so this review summarizes both her experience and mine. We ordered the tirokafteri as a starter, the lamb souvlaki, the steak and shrimp mixed souvlaki grill, and baklava ice cream for dessert.  During our visit, we had a few issues that came up that made us wonder if their service quality had dropped -- the first is that our food took far too long for us to receive, even after people who ordered after us were getting their food before we got it. Another issue is that my mother specifically wanted her Greek salad as a side to her meal, instead of it being served at the start of the meal like it normally was. Instead, she still got her salad but there was no side that came out with her order when we FINALLY received it. After we talked to the servers at the time, they put in our order as a rush order and also provided additional rice pilaf for my mother, which was enough to placate us ( though we still had another moment of one of the servers asking if we wanted our ice cream so soon after getting our food. Really? ).  Anyway, to the food itself! Of course I've been a regular here for quite some time, so I know that the food is good. But to just state as such wouldn't be convincing: the tirokafteri was the perfect blend of creamy, salty and spicy, and was perfect with the pita bread. The lamb was juicy and perfectly cooked and the rice fluffy and flavorful -- my mother also mentioned that her shrimp and steak were among the best skewers in town. Of course, there's also the dessert -- the baklava ice cream was cool, sweet and refreshing, with large pieces of baklava clearly visible in the dessert. I believe this is house-made? Either way, I have never seen any other dessert like it in town!  The Great Greek is always popular to a ridiculous degree -- even with their expansions into the southwest and in the northwest, their Henderson location still remains busy, with lines sometimes stretching outside the door! That and this review should be hopefully enough to convince you to go despite any potential service hiccups -- your new favorite Greek spot is waiting!",

I think my first mistake was that I order the steak \"well done\" as I hate raw steak but I hadn't realized that it was sirloin steak. The steak was chewy and honestly I almost choked on it. The side salad and it's dressing was really good except I bit into an olive not knowing there was a seed in it! Good thing I didn't break my tooth!   The food was just okay.   On the other hand, I order a piece of baklava and oohhh my goodness gracious, I'm not even a sweets lover, but dayum this dessert was top notch! The top was flaky and as you got to the bottom of the piece it would get more and more sweet. But not too sweet as I believe it's sweetened with honey. It was like. So. Good. I was supposed to share half with my boyfriend but I ate the whole thing! Whoopsie!  So my advice is to skip the food and just buy the baklava! Next time I'm going to try the baklava ice cream because that looked really good too!",

And while I usually go straight for the falafel at greek places, I find it pretty lacking here. I found it too dry and kinda bland. I also generally go for hummus, but I found it pretty unmemorable. HOWEVER, their salad wrap, greek salad with grilled salmon, and tzaziki sauce are amazing options I definitely recommend. And grabbing an order of feta fries is a MUST. Ridiculously crispy and simultaneously fluffy, these are fries are seriously delicious. The quality is decent, the taste is great, and the price is just right.  Also, while the service is friendly, you may not get your food super fast since this place is poppin'.

They are friendly, fast, considerate and the food --is absolutely fantastic--  I always order my typical large greek salad, with gyro. I order online so when I show up food is good to go. Sure enough, by the time I drive from my office to the restaurant my food is ready. I commend the staff at this place because they are always so busy but they always get things out in a timely manner.    My order is always to-go but I end up sitting outside to eat. The girl who works on friday afternoons always stops by and asks if I need anything else. This is wonderful, she acknowledges that I might not be \"dining-in\" but she still cares about my experience at their location. Kudos to you for great customer service.   The restaurant is also very clean. The bathrooms are clean (yay). The staff at The Great Greek takes pride in where they work obviously.

    "text": "Overall: The Great Greek serves up good Greek food, and everyone seems to know so don't be surprised if there aren't any seats!  Food: 4  Grilled Chicken Souvlaki: The chicken was moist with a nice grilled flavor. The rice was fluffy and separated, just how I like it, but it's not as flavorful as the rice at my favorite kabab place. A lot of places seem to skimp on the quality of their pita bread, but their pita bread was fluffy and soft.  Grilled Steak Souvlaki: The steak was tender and moist. I enjoy the grilled flavor on meats, but they took it slightly to far and some edges were burnt and bitter.  Both our plates were on the saltier side (in terms of meat and rice), but it became well balanced when eaten with the light tzatziki and acidic salad.  Service: 3  The restaurant is quick service, so you order at the counter and servers will bring out your dish if it's eat in.  The servers were nice. I didn't realize that there was feta cheese on the salads so I didn't specify no cheese during my order, but they were still nice enough to exchange our salads for us. Even though it's quick service, the staff was nice enough to stop by and ask us about our meal occasionally.  However, the cashier did seem to have a little bit of an attitude. She made a face when another customer ripped open a packet of sugar and ate it alone.  Ambiance: 4  The restaurant is fairly small but super busy. As a result, it may be difficult to find seating inside the restaurant. They do have some nice tables outside with umbrellas, but I'm not a fan of sitting in the heat.",

I stopped in here for lunch one day and got a gyro meat rice bowl, baklava, and a fountain drink.  The bowl consisted of rice pilaf, gyro meat, tomatoes, chickpeas, onions, tzatziki sauce, and lemon and it was outstanding.  The amount of meat that came with it was a welcome sign and boy was it flavorful!  The baklava, while good, wasn't as good as others I've had before.  After adding the drink, my meal came out to about $20 which for lunch is quite pricey.  If the prices were a bit lower I could easily see myself eating here weekly because I enjoyed my meal that much.",

We had hummus and pita, chicken and steak souvlaki, rice, feta fries, along with desserts. Everything was amazing.   This is an order at the front restaurant and have a seat. But they cook to order, bring out your food and clear your tables so don't forget to tip!  Now more about the food:  hummus and pita were great, the steak souvlaki was perfectly cooked and the rice was good. The feta fries were my favorite. Never had anything like that and what a treat. The desserts were also a hit.   I can't wait for this place to open a big sit down restaurant.  Do it!",

I highly suggest getting there for an early dinner or late lunch! It's a smaller restaurant and always busy during normal eating times, so I normally take our food to go when the tables inside and outside are taken. The wait can be a bit long, but they're sweet enough to offer cups for water while you're waiting! (I suggest ordering ahead, which I always forget to do!)   Food:  Everything I see come out looks amazing and everything I've ordered so far has been delicious. The meats are normally tender and juicy and all salads are crisp and refreshing! (Hate when you bite into a salad and don't get the crunch or texture you hope for!)  I normally get the Great Greek Gyro or the Gyro plate because the meat is so tender and juicy! Add the fries because they are always the perfect amount of softness with a slight crunch! Add the hummus and pita bread for appetizers! YUM!  Overall, I'd say it's a delicious place to eat at or take food to go from.  Short, simple review for a simple food turned up a notch from this restaurant!",

Coming from a large Greek family, I've tried a lot of different gyros. But today, having eaten at the great Greek for the first time, I have found my new favorite Greek restaurant. It's a small, family owned place with beyond amazing customer service, perfect atmosphere, and some of the best Greek food I've ever tried.  I've also never taken the time to actually sit down a write a review of a place for Yelp, but this restaurant was so good, I wanted to be able to share my thoughts.

More people came in and started ordering. They all started getting their food and I'm still sitting there waiting for my order. After waiting for 25 minutes(20 minutes after they are open), I asked them how much longer it was going to be. They said because I ordered before they opened, they didn't have the chicken prepared yet at the time I ordered so they were still waiting for the chicken(that makes no sense they start prepping at opening time and not before?) I asked if it took more than 20 minutes to cook chicken so she said she will check on it. I got my order almost 10 minutes later. I don't think it should take 30 minutes for a Greek salad with chicken and rice bowl with chicken. Specially when a party of about 10 people came in after I did are almost finished eating their food that they ordered after I did. I only gave them 3 stars because I like their food. Otherwise, it would've been 1 star",

Went for the same steak souvlaki plate to share. Meat was tender and delicious. Feta fries were crispy , savory and melt in your mouth. We tried the soup this time. So comforting.  Definitely don't get a huge lemon flavor but it's there. It's so comforting and hits the spot. I can see myself coming here in the cold months and ordering 2 bowls it's so good. We also tried spanakopita which was good as well. Crispy phyllo dough with spinach and cheese the bitterness of the spinach could have used some more cheese IMO but nonetheless still yummy. Last but not least we had some Baklava .  Oh my gosh ! I thought I died and went to heaven. This was absolutely delicious. Layers of phyllo dough and ground walnuts and honey. I heard they only use honey and not sugar. I'm glad because I can't handle things that are overly sweet. This was perfect. So delicious. I will be back great Greek. Next time I will try and order something other than the steak. I've stuck to it because it's just that good.",

    "text": "Stopped by around 6pm and ordered The Great Greek Gyro ($7.95) with chicken.  Unfortunately It took somewhere between 20-25 minutes to get my food!  This would have been okay at a sit down restaurant but at a order at the counter sort of place I feel that 25 minutes is way too long. Seemed a little unorganized between the kitchen and cash register which really shouldn't have been going on considering there were only about 4 tables full and a few to go orders placed.   I was pretty HANGRY (hungry and angry) by the time I got home but after my first bite almost all was forgiven!! Delicious chicken with just the right amount of feta and tzatziki sauce! Probably the best gyro I have ever had so despite how long it took I have to give the Great Greek 4 stars and return again hoping for faster service. During the long hiatus before I got my food I also noticed that they had a great beer selection (Hoegaarden, Guiness, IPA, Stella)  so maybe I will come back for a sit down with a gyro and beer next time.",

    "text": "Came here for lunch a couple of days ago. What a nice surprise it turned out to be. The location is very clean and inviting with large windows to let in the sunshine. The staff was very friendly and quick to bring out the food. I had the grilled shrimp entree. The shrimp were huge, and perfectly seasoned. Delicious!! It came with a nice Greek side salad, and the entree came with a bed of rice, a side of fresh pita bread, and tzatziki. My husband tried the Great Greek Gyro. It was huge!! Came stuffed with a generous portion of beef/lamb and very fresh lettuce, tomatoes, red onion, feta cheese and tzaski. Ordered a side of Feta french fries that were to die for. Never had anything quite like them. The fries were crisp, fresh and hot. Definitely give these a try. To end the meal we ordered an amazing \"Mom's\" rice pudding. this dessert was fresh still warm and topped with cinnamon. Some of the best I've ever had!! If you like Greek food. definitely give this place a try. It is delicious food, with reasonable prices and huge portions served by a very friendly staff.",

    "text": "FUN local place with impeccably fresh and authentic tastes of Greece.   Order at the counter, and be prepared to do as the locals do:  when the restaurant is full get your food to go or ask to share a table.   The line to order can stretch out the door, but moves quickly and efficiently. Lots of cooks in the kitchen on a Friday night -- we saw 6 -- cooking as fast as they  could in a kitchen we could see was stocked with authentic quality ingredients.   Kids meals re the perfect side for smaller tummies but don't dumb down for Americans: choices are 1/2 gyros, 1/2 souvlakis and other smaller portions of Greek favourites -- no chicken nuggets or grilled cheeses. TWO THUMBS UP FROM US!!   One of us had the beef souvlaki and asked that the steak be cooked rare, and IT WAS!! So many Greek places seem to be unable to cook steak rarer than medium, so we were excited! The steak was tender, deliciously seaoned, and did we say RARE??  The cup of Avgolemono soup comes studded with rice and chicken, served with a quartered pita on the side. It is easily enough for a light meal, and was so delicious we took what we couldn't finish back to the hotel to finish with breakfast tomorrow.   A side of falafel arrived fried perfectly, not greasy at all, and spiked with cardamom for extra YUM.   Two of us got the Great Greek Original Rode Bowls -- large Greek salads with a scoop of yummy rice pilaf.  These salads were made with perfectly crisp fresh leaf lettuce, seasoned chickpeas, small diced red onions, tangy pitted Kalamata olives, and a meat (chicken or beef souvlaki or gyro meat)  or fish of your choice (salmon or shrimp) or falafel, all dressed in tangy and lemony Greek dressing. DELICIOUS!!   We got an order of fresh homemade Koftiedes cookies to go.   We HEARTILY RECOMMEND this restaurant -- Henderson locals have a gem in this place!!",

I LOVE the chicken lemon soup. The Greek salad is good too - they use good, real feta unlike other places. I usually get chicken skewers that are yummy and juicy too. The crazy fries are amazing - the French fries are very tasty and the crazy fries have feta on top that melts and tastes like a dream. Ok - I am done now.

I remember seeing many great Yelp reviews so decided to give them a try. It was not busy when I arrived around noon.   The girl at the register was all business. Not unfriendly, but not friendly either. I ordered the Great greek gyro with the infamous feta fries and a drink. It was around $12.50 for the combo. I received my order in a decent amount of time. The pita was good, nice and soft. However the meat was really dry. I thought the feta fries were completely overrated, maybe I had a bad batch? The fries seemed under cooked to me. The meal was okay, but definately nothing I would return for.   I will stay True to Greek Bistro as I think their gyros and seasoned fries are much much better.",

    "text": "Great food, great service, a little pricey. Tried this place just to check it out.  I like Mediterranean food as I am from that area and have been there several times.  I know what authentic Mediterranean food is, although I dont really care if it is, as long as its good.  This place was busy for lunch and everyone seemed to be enjoying their food.  You know its good when you order something, and see another persons food come out and youre like \"damn, I should have gotten that too\".  Its an order at the counter place, like McDonalds.  My only gripe is when places like this charge fine dining prices.  My lunch combo was $17 after a 15% tip for a walk up order.  Inside is just basic.  A tv, some tables, and thats it.  Ambiance level 0/10.  Service was 10/10.  Every guy in there, and I dont know how they do it for a fast food place, seemed genuinely happy to serve the customers and had a great attitude.  I notice things like this because its rare, but this place would not be the same without these guys working.  They are great.  Food was excellent and tasted great.  Not authentic at all, but I didnt go in for that.  I went for good tasting food and this was great.  Portion sizes were super small.  $4 for fries and it was like those little kid condiment trays.  I would say I got 10 fries.  Those 10 fries are probably the best in the county though.  They do the double spray potato method on them and were crisp to perfection.  No joke, best fries anywhere in town.  My gyro was also super small.  For $8, it was just a kids size pita.  Again, the taste was great.  I got the lamb, my girl got a steak kabob which was excellent.  Hers was really small too.  I am a baklava fanatic.  Its one of the only deserts I like.  I get it in every Mediterranean country I go to and I get it a lot.  $4 is steep, but they are bigger than traditional baklava.  Not authentic and harder to eat, but the taste is the same.  Despite it not being authentic, I really enjoyed it.  Great consistency, great taste.  Overall, this place is overpriced but the food and service is worth it.  If yo are on a tight budget, you might not have the same experience.  If you are looking for a romantic dinner, go somewhere else.  If you are looking for 5 star service, and really good food, give this place a try.  I will probably come back just based on the service.",

The staff is friendly, the food is excellent, and the prices are reasonable -- especially given the portion sizes.  The only thing that keeps them from getting five stars is the slow service I had on my past visit (I was wondering if they were growing the potatoes for my feta fries) and the \"well done\" quality of those same fries (i.e. almost burnt cheese on top). That said, they were still delicious and my gyro was excellent.  If you still have room afterwards, try the baklava. It is very good with a good amount of filling, not all filo dough like some places.",

I'll be going in to check it out furthermore.",

I wish they had a garlic sauce here to put on my chicken pita. The employees were friendly and the food comes out fast.

Service was friendly and reasonably prompt (about 10 minutes for our food after ordering). The side salad was very fresh and crisp. The Gyro meat was delicious although a little salty.  The falafels were okay but a bit dry. Overall a decent fast food Greek restaurant and We would try it again if we are in the area.",

It's located in small strip Mall. It shares a parking lot with multiple businesses so parking can be tricky but there was plenty when we were there on a Friday night.  INSIDE The inside of the restaurant is very clean and everyone is super friendly.   OUTSIDE They have an outdoor seating if you want an outside view. We chose this option and the weather was beautiful.   SERVICE  Friendly, efficient.  FOOD Great food, amazing service! We are from California and depend on Yelp reviews when out of town. This was a no brainer and boy, we were not disappointed. First time dining here with my girlfriend and they've definitely earned our business. The entire experience was great! Service was very friendly and accommodating.  I ordered the Lamb Souvlaki with Feta Fries and my gf got the Rice bowl which was much more than rice. Garbanzo beans, onions Feta, cucumber, romain with the steak for protein. She said it was a perfect bowl of food!! The salad that came with my meal was very light and refreshing. We ordered baklava to take home.  Very tasty. We personally didn't mind the wait nor did we think too much about it. Our food came out in around 15 minutes after ordering (there was a few people ahead of us also). If that was a long wait, then I wonder how quick they usually bring out food. Back to the food, we loved everything we ordered and the portions are pretty generous. I definitely recommend trying the feta fries, the fries are SO GOOD and crispy! My lamb was perfectly cooked (I wanted Medium), and was very delicious. Steak was delicious, and also cooked perfectly. Very tender. If you have the extra stomach, try the baklava as well for dessert.  ONLINE ORDERING  Can order online and ahead! I saw a Grub Hub driver come in and take the food away.  STAFF Friendly  SUMMARY  Fresh dependable menu items served by friendly staff.  We had great customer service and all things addressed were quickly answered and taken care of. Awesome job to the manager and staff of The Great Greek!!",

Same goes for the Feta fries which you can get in a combo, although the gyros alone should fill you up. The interior design coincided with the culture of food sold, which I thought added a welcoming character. The dining area is a little tight, getting to the drink foundation can turn into an obstacle course as you weave between tables and people when their busy. Tables were wiped down nicely however my seat had remains of feta cheese from the previous diner. When we defaulted from two entree combos to one combo, the cashier offered a water cup which I thought was a kind gesture.",

I tried the chicken breast kabob salad! For $7 this serving is huge, I can't believe I had left overs from a salad. The chicken was juicy and bursting with flavor. The salad consisted of lettuce, tomatoes, olives, onions and more! My friends ordered the gyros with chicken with friend fries in the side.

Most of the reviews raved over this place and I for one can not disagree.  We got in around 3pm on a weekday and this place had a lot of patrons dining at the time, always a great sign.  The food, cleanliness of the dining area and service were top notch!  We started with our orders at the counter.  We explained that it was our first time here and the lady who took our order was very friendly and was kind enough to give up some recommendations on things to try.  We placed an order for a Hummus App, Great Greek Gyro with Lemon soup side and the Chicken Souvlaki with a side salad.  A lot of food for about 27 bucks.  The Hummus which was very good, not the best I've had but very good for the price was out fairly quick.  The Chicken Souvlaki was excellent with the rice pilaf.  The Chicken was very tender and had a great taste.  My wife had the chicken gyro which looked amazing.  Her soup which she was kind enough to let me try tasted great.  Very unique on the taste, the lemon soup can really bring together a great meal.  My salad was good but I really had wished I got that soup, I guess next time!     As a lunch or dinner option, you can't go wrong with the Great Greek.  The menu is diverse and food tastes great.  Decent size portions for the price will probably have you coming back for more.  I for one will be adding this place as one of my regular stops whenever I am in the mood for excellent greek food!",

I was expecting typical gyro, but I was wrong. The sauce and the feta cheese was really good. What I really am still thinking about is the salad and salad dressing. That salad was very good, the dressing I used as additional sauce for my gyro.  This is definately a place I'm coming back to. The place is an okay size restaurant, but it's so busy there is no room to sit. That's really tells you it's a good place to eat. Just be prepared when you want to sit down and you have to wait 10 minutes.",

I yelped (thank you yelpsters for all of your continued help!) and found The Great Greek... not the one I keep reading about on your way to Cali that makes me drool just from the descriptions... but there's a NEW ONE here in Henderson on Warm Springs!!  Immediately I begin talking the 8 year old (newly picky eater) into the fabulous foods that await him, and my hubby and I repeat lines back and forth of 'My Big Fat Greek Wedding' (oh, if only you knew how close this is to our lives!) including \"YOU DON'T EAT NO MEAT! That's okay, I cook lamb for you.\"    We get there and there is not an empty seat in the house, and you can smell the goodies from the kitchen, and they have the desserts right by the cash register to get your saliva flowing!  We ordered the \"Family of 4 Platter\"  (approx $45) and as our luck would go, as we filled our glasses, a table opened up!    Almost immediately the salad showed up, simple with bright flavors that totally complimented one another, that even the 4 year old inhaled (and he is strictly a carbs/sugar kind of kid!)  Then the platters came out, and kept coming!  We had ordered a huge platter of the BEST french fries I think I have ever had, seriously! And then 4 heavenly Gyro's (2 chicken, 2 lamb/beef) on \"MELT IN YOUR MOUTH\" soft pita's, seasoned to perfection and oh so tender, and topped with the best goodies... and HUGE, did I mention how HUGE everything is?  To top it all off we had 4 desserts that came with the platter, so we tried multiple Baklava and Shamali, that with one bite made our eyes roll back and a low \"ummmmm\" sigh release from the adults at the table!  The food was beautiful, and tasted amazing.  What a treasure to have here in our little valley, that I KNOW we will visit often.  My husband is amazing at packing in the food, and even he stopped 3/4 of the way and said he was done, he was so stuffed!   KUDOS to The Great Greek!",

My first time I had the gyro plate, with a large portion of gyro meat, rice and salad - the tzatziki is amazing, slightly tart - rich flavor, sooooo yummy I wanted to bathe in it!  I couldn't wait to go back!  I met a girlfriend for lunch last Friday and had the Greek salad with falafel, again, I was so happy with the freshness of the food - the portions are perfect and the service is really good - the entire staff is helpful and friendly. My friend had the grilled salmon - oh my gosh, it was so good (even though we had to wait a little longer, it was worth it!).  All in all I was very happy on my second visit.  Saturday I met another friend for lunch - this time I ordered the rice bowl and had the gyro meat again.  Again, delicious and I just couldn't get enough tzatziki! My friend had the chicken rice bowl and was very pleased with the portion size and taste.  It was pretty busy for 2pm on Saturday, but still had great service from very attentive front end workers.    I am a fan for life!",

I decided to have the rice pilaf with the gyro plate instead of fries, and I would highly recommend it. The gyro plate and gyro wrap both came with Greek salads which were filled with a lot of veggies, olives and feta.  I have had a lot of Greek salads, but this had to have been one of my favorites.  While we were eating, a gentleman at the table next to us said that the food is always amazing and that he had even had them cater for him.

    "text": "There is absolutely nothing great about The Great Greek with the exception that they greatly manage to fool a lot of Yelpers into thinking this is a four-and-a-half star average listing. \"Eek! Methinks not.\"  If this is the best greek in the valley, then I should quit eating greek food right here and fucking now because it was \"A-OK\" at best. Add to the sum of the equation the shittiest service I have received anywhere in Twenty-Fifteen, and you've got yourself a one-star. Great job, Great Greek.   The night I went -- the last time I shall ever patronise this shit show -- it was packed. It might be always packed here. (People have no taste.) Now, I will never penalise a business for being too popular; however, I will deduct stars for how they handle their high amount of traffic.   Service The ladies providing the table service were beyond rude. \"Excuse me!\" they would loudly shout every couple of minutes in the same way one would exclaim \"Get the fuck out the way, asshole.\" The queue exists, and it only has a very small area where to exist, and those in it weren't even excessively occupying more square space than necessary. \"Excuse me!\"   On the other hand, the lovely, middle-aged lady behind the till was pleasant without exception the entire time  we were there. She should get a raise if she is not already the owner. \"Excuse me!\"  The service aside from the cashier continued to earn itself the Worst In Show with one of the \"Excuse Me!\" ladies tossing the plates on our table and snatching the table number without asking if we needed anything else. Missing was the dessert, naturally -- \"Excuse Me!\" -- and my fucking salad.   Food The food was alright. I had the Greek lamb burger because I am boring. The dessert might have been the greatest thing west of the goddamn Mississippi; however, I shall never know.   Just like The Great Greek will never know anything other than this one-star from Edwin P. from Las Vegas, Nevada, U.S.A.  The yuppies with no taste and no sense of decent service can keep it. One star.",

I ordered Avgolemono Soup ($3.50) which is the traditional Greek soup with chicken, lemon, and rice. The portion was really quite large. It also came with a side of their delicious pita bread. Molly T and I decided to also split The Great Greek Gyro (~ $8.00) with lamb-beef combination. The portion, once again, was huge! And the gyro was really quite tasty. Jaime W shared her feta fries with us and they were delicious. They sound simple enough, but wow...they can quickly turn into a guilty pleasure.  All in all, the prices are extremely reasonable for the quality and quantity of the food. It does get very packed during lunch time, and they close at 8 pm Mon-Thur.",

We had to wait for about 10 mins for a table to open up but I'm so glad that we did. The restaurant was very clean despite the crowd.   I ordered the Greek Rice Bowl which had two chicken skewers on a bed of rice covered in lettuce, marinated chickpeas, feta cheese, and kalamata olives.  You can add onion and tomato if that's your thing.  The bowl is deliciously dressed but there is also a side tzatziki sauce which is so good I felt like I could drink it.  At the risk of embarrassing my company, I refrained...in case you were wondering.  The only note I would offer is that the place can be a little pricey (almost $30 for two if us).  There are some dishes on the menu (featuring lamb) that are pushing $18 which seemed high for the super casual atmosphere.   The staff was very accommodating and super friendly. I will definitely be returning!",

    "text": "I more than love Great Greek. I could eat here every day if possible. It's more than just delicious food. When I come into Great Greek I feel like a part of the family. Every person who works at Great Greek is friendly, efficient, and they make me want to come back to the restaurant. We met the owners and their family, and each of them thanked us profusely for coming to eat at their establishment. What more could you ask for?  Well, I guess you could ask for good food, but that is a given when you come to eat here. There is so much to try and not enough time! I haven't been able to eat the rice due to a gluten allergy - they did not feel confident that the pilaf was OK for me to eat (it rarely is), so I had Feta Fries instead. They were terrible. Never eat them! I will suffer the torment and eat anyone's orders if they don't want them! They're simple, overloaded with dressing and cheese - just delicious with herbs and feta. For $13 you get a Greek Salad with delicious good quality Olive Oil dressing, Pita (if you're not GF), 2 Chicken Souvlaki Skewers, Feta Fries and happiness. Could you ask for more? Their steak is also always cooked a perfect medium rare, and their shrimp are so delicious I could eat 4 skewers and still want more!  Their Avgolemono Soup is my favorite...ever. This is made with just white rice, no pilaf. Their hummus is homemade, smooth and delicious, just like everything else on their menu. What's not to love?  My husband has had the gyros and the rice bowls and loves them both. The gyros meat is good, not as salty as the meat we had back home in Chicago. He says the rice could be eaten in pounds all day long, the rice bowl is great because when you mix everything together and add a pita nothing can go wrong!   I would call ahead if you're ordering take out, or if you want to know their daily special. I've had their grilled lamb chops, and I assure you, it is worth every last dollar spent on that dinner. SO GOOD. The Greek Chicken special is one of my favorites too! You won't go wrong stopping by here! Eat and enjoy!",

This is my third time visiting and each time it doesn't disappoint.   The restaurant was packed and every table was taken at 2PM on a Thursday. I was on that side of town after hiking in Boulder City and was running late to class, but decided that a chicken gyro was worth being 15 minutes late for. After having a few gyros from Paymon's and having issues with being skipped on hummus, I was worried that I would have to ask for extra tzatziki with my gyro but after seeing the monster of a sandwich that came out, I knew I was in great hands. So much chicken, so much sauce, the pita was perfect- a week later I'm still dreaming about it.   While waiting for my sandwich their cashier was sweet enough to let me try their vanilla cookie which was just as delicious and satisfyingly sugary. I can't wait to come back and am thinking of making the 30+ minute drive from my house just to have another gyro!",

I recently tried this place about 3 months ago and have easily visited ten times since then. Everything about The Great Greek delivers.  I'm partial to the Traditional Gyro as their beef and lamb blend is delicious and always cooked perfectly.  My wife orders the Greek Salad with a side of gyro meat and always raves about the freshness of the produce. Their dressing is on point too!  And to top it off, Baklava Ice Cream is a delicious dessert. It's bursting with fresh baklava flavor and honey and the serving size is quite generous.",

My husbands steak portion also looks less than usual. The tzatziki sauce was also much more mild than usual. Hoping this is just a bad week but thought you might like the feedback.

    "text": "It's almost comical how often I've eaten their food without actually making a visit. Now that I have, it's time to review.  My friend and I were going to try another Greek restaurant closer to my place, but they had already closed on Christmas Eve. Luckily, we had a plan B that was still open: Yelp and Las Vegas Weekly \"Best of Las Vegas\" darling The Great Greek.  It's tougher than expected to reach it because whoever designed the plaza inexplicably didn't add enough entrances or even paths. Even though you can see the restaurant from Warm Springs, you'll have to make several turns to arrive at the parking area. It's welcoming enough once you finally enter, with indoor seating for around 20 and a TV with ESPNEWS in HD.  The Great Greek Gyro ($7.95) with a beef and lamb mixture (or chicken if you really, truly must) is a solid lunch option. In addition to the tomatoes, red onions, and tzatziki of the \"Traditional Gyro\" ($6.95), this pita comes with lettuce and feta. I had experienced this in an assemble-it-yourself form many times with trays ordered for group events, and while it was certainly fresher and warmer at the restaurant, it still didn't truly tantalize my taste buds.  That said, it's at least on par with if not better than any other recent gyro that I've experienced. And it's really cool that they cut it in advance per request so that I could share it with a friend.  I also split one of the \"traditional plate\" menu items. The Grilled Garlic Shrimp ($12.95) has two skewers of four marinated shrimp a piece. The shrimp was cooked properly and had that juicy bite to it. I can't say that the stated garlic, and oregano were particularly prominent flavors, but I liked squeezing the lemon wedge for acidity. The pita was good, the tzatziki was fine, but... the fries.  Specifically, the feta fries, which I think was a slight upcharge (maybe I'll back-calculate from credit card records) from the regular fries. But it was worth it for the rich feta and its creamier partner in crime. Sure, the fries alone are the fairly thick, floured kind that I enjoy the most, but do the feta fries if you can.  There was also a small salad included in the plate, with a simple vinaigrette not really contributing as much as that ever-present feta. It's cool though. I mean, what are you doing here anyway if you don't like feta?  I'll probably be back, but not in a huge hurry or anything. My first visit bore out my past perceptions that the food is really solid, but not the be-all and end-all of Greek cuisine.",

Gyros plate with rice and salad, I like my salad village style...tomatoes, cucumbers, feta cheese and dressing.  My man orders the 2 skewer meal, lamb and beef, with rice and regular Greek salad. If we are really hungry we order the feta fries also. Feta fries are fries covered with melted Feta and I believe Monterey jack cheese...mmmm mmmm mmmm! The Gyros is cooked to perfection and so flavorful. The rice is buttery and lemony perfection. I don't know where they get their tomatoes from but they are always so ripe and red and flavorful.  The meat for the skewers is always cooked exactly how you request and the steak skewer meat is so tender and tasty I would think it was filet mignon.  They need to expand their Henderson location because they are sooooo busy that sometimes you have to wait for a table and they are always busy with take outs!!! We LOVE the Great Greek and even though it is a drive for us it is well worth it!!!! We always take visitors there for dinner when they come to town!  Keep up the great cooking!!!",

The lamb beef gyros are the best I've ever eaten and the feta fries are to die for. The portions are huge, as such, my husband and I share one portion of the feta fries. I simply can't say enough about how good the food is here! The baklava is truly decadent and definitely were sharing as well!

They have a Greek Burger ($7.50), it has lettuce, tomato, red onion, feta cheese and tzaziki - the combination is amazing! If you are craving a burger and are looking for something a little different definitely get this.   You are always greeted with a smile when you go in there. They are very friendly and the service is fast. This a good place to go on a lunch break. You feel like you are part of the family when you are there.",

What disappointed us was they forgot to put in our order, We waited for over an hour. We understand it was very busy at after 7pm and it's a to go order but we waited for over an hour to almost closing and still no food. They did nothing but to rush to make our order right before they close. I am all about second chances. We went back and the same thing happen again. This time, it's not a to go order and not at 7pm. It was early in the evening. We waited for over 30 minute, and all the customer came after us got their food. I asked what happen to our order. They forgot about us again. What the heck. If you don't have enough people in the kitchen, hire more people or don't take any more orders if you can't handle it. We still come here but not as much as before. I don't want to starve us or give someone more business if they can't handle it.",

They are not familiar with greek food due to living in the land of Packers, beer, brats and cheese.  Needless to say, they loved it.  The gyros are the best in town.  Everything is fresh and tastes fabulous.  The gyro meat is nicely seasoned and you know it comes off a doner.  I had a small salad with my gyro and the dressing was excellent, not heavy at all and the perfect amount.  Next time we will have to save room for some dessert.  I wish it was closer to where we live.",

My co-worker and I went here for lunch today because they have the best chicken salad (Greek Salad w/ Grilled Chicken Breast).

Thanks to Yelp reviews, Torrance and I decided to give it a try... and I am glad we did! Torrance had the beef/lamb gyro with feta fries. I had the chicken gyro with regular fries. We both ate every morsel, it was so good.  2 combo meals cost us a little over $20. We will be back soon!",

I loved every last bite on my food crawl with Jaime W. and Dana S. That egg-lemon-rice soup, yeah, I would bathe in that shit. It would make me smell funny, but I feel it probably contains healing properties for the soul that regular bath water can't fulfill.  The Gyro meat was especially delicious as well. Yeah, I could see myself eating here on a regular basis...they just have to move in downstairs. A major plus is that you can dine outside and they will bring your food to you. I know that their tea is just regular Fuze tea, but it was so good!   5 stars. Go before I renovate my basement to be their new kitchen.",

We also grabbed a couple of sides of grilled chicken skewers for our kids, and they shared our fries. The chicken  was buttery, lemony, garlicky good. Wasn't a thing left over. Really want to try their famous rice pudding, as well as their veggie app platter next time.",

When I got home I opened it up and was really glad that I was super hungry because it was a pretty stuffed wrap.  The meat is tender, juicy and flavorful without being too salty or greasy. The feta cheese and tzatziki sauce added a nice dimension.  My only complaint that isn't really a complaint because it's also kind of a good thing is that it's messy. With the feta and tzatziki loaded on top, and the wrap stuffed full makes it a good messy. Especially when it gets to the part where its wrapped, use caution when unwrapping to be able to continue enjoying it as a wrap and not a splat.",

I got suckered into the hype but I have had way better.   I called in an order for pick-up. The guy put me on hold but I hung up after hearing him chat the whole time with another customer about irrelevant stuff. Second time I called the guy took my order and I liked how fast he turned around my order, said it would be ready in 15 minutes.   The restaurant is a bit small but it's really cute. It has an outdoor seating area with shades and a water fountain. The inside looks very clean and organized. I ordered two gyro sandwiches and a combo which comes drink and fries. The guy that took my order was a lot nicer in person and very cute I must say. When I got home I chowed down and it was satisfying but not out of this world. The amount of meat was good, how gyros should be, but it was not that marinated it was bland. The tzatziki sauce did not taste much like cucumber or the fresh dill it's described as but it had a lot of feta which made it taste better. The fries were ok.  I want to give the greek bowl a chance. Place is convenient for Hendersonians but I rather drive and use my gas tank to Las Vegas and go to The Fat Greek on the corner of Flamingo and Decatur. My review is from 2011, check it out but my thoughts have not changed. Maybe I held my standards high for this place in comparison but I'll update this review if my mind changes.",

The restaurant itself is casual and small but has many tables to dine in at, and they have outdoor seating as well. It does get busy but you'll get a table soon enough. You can also call ahead to take out.   The service is OK. The employees are nice enough and they're great about clearing tables. It usually takes me quite a bit of time after ordering to get the food but it's so worth the wait.   Their classic greek salad is delicious. The hummus and pita is the perfect side dish or snack. They also include pita with the salad so I try just to get a small side of hummus and not the whole appetizer dish. The portions are great.   If you haven't tried this place I'll warn you, the food is so amazing that your first taste will make you a hopeless Great Greek addict just like me! I'm going to need a support group soon because my husband must think I have a serious problem with how often I want to come here!",

I wasn't quite sure on what I wanted bc it was my first time here. She rolled her eyes and as she walked away she rudely said, \"just let me know when you're ready, I need to do forks\". Then I let her know I was ready to order, and she said, \"hang on I'm not ready\"  Then someone else came up to take my order and I thought she would be a better experience. We are healthy eaters, so when I didn't want fries or rice, I asked for a side of vegetables and she told me no. She didn't even give me another option. I told her I wanted to buy a side and she said that would be five dollars. And that they don't do substitutions. Overall it was a horrible experience.",

If I come in during peak lunch hour, I usually get my food to go because it's so packed that there isn't an open table. No big deal - just shows how much people enjoy their food. I'm glad that the manager clarified on Yelp what the picketing on the street corner was about. We were  really curious.",

The salads are huge, crisp, fresh, and their greek dressing is fantastic. I do enjoy a gyro on occasion, and the quality of gyro meat is very good, and tasty. Tzatziki is made in house, along with the hummus, and baba ganoush (which they call a different name) all delicious. They sometimes have a lambchop special which is fantastic. Plan ahead during peak hours, because it does get busy. Definitely worth the wait. Nona, at the counter, is the greatest too! She keeps things moving swiftly, and efficiently, and has never gotten my order wrong.",

We moved away from Vegas four years ago but every time we visit we head straight here from the airport.  Oh and don't forget to order the tzatziki, it is creamy and the perfect combination of cucumber and dill.",

    "text": "Was looking for something a bit different from our norm so we figured on Mediterranean.  Now, usually, we'd go to Paymon's but this little place had some great reviews and was close to home so why not... Thankfully,  it lived up to the hype. The menu isn't extensive but it doesn't need to be, honestly. I chose the grilled steak, my wife (who was craving a burger from off the radar) chose The Athenian (as did a number of the folks grabbing a bite and the take out).  We also ordered the Dolmas and the Hummus, both being very flavorful. The burger was cooked to order and the feta fries very rich and tasty.  The steak skewers were near perfect as was the rice pilaf. I could have done without the minced onion garnish as well as the onions in the Greek side salad but other than that, no real complaints. The sitting area does get warm in the late afternoon sun so do try sitting towards the front or the mirrored side wall. The staff was friendly (at least the two cute young ladies we dealt with) and attentive, checking in a few times. We didn't try dessert,  but next time.",

A party of two ordered after us, then a party on one and a party of three ordered after them. ALL of them were served before our food to go was ready. We asked the cashier/server/bus boy why three parties for their food before us and he said \"we're really busy right now. Maybe that big order up on the window is yours.\" My mom told him \"We ordered two things and everyone else ordered way more than us. Why is it taking so long? This is not ok.\" The guy said sorry, but didn't try to make anything right. Thankfully when we got home and took a bite of the Gyros they tasted great. Hopefully, if we decide to go back this place will be on their game.",

Which I'm totally okay with, because the friendly smiles, the delicious authentic dishes make take out just as good as dining in! My wife and I love this place, from their traditional dishes like Souvlaki (chicken or steak), the gyros, or their modern options like feta fries, and the Athenian burger. The variety of delicious Greek food is worth the sometimes long lines out the door.  Come hungry, leave full and satisfied. And if you have any room left after a helping of their generous size dishes, the baklava and the baklava ice cream is phenomenal! The Great Greek always does everything right! I wish them continuing success, and I can't wait to done with them again!",

    "text": "There are a lot of good Greek restaurants in Henderson.  From my house to this place is like climbing Mt. Olympus but it's soooo worth the drive.  Holy Michael Bolton, this is my favorite Greek restaurant in all the land!    It's a small but very clean restaurant.  This may be irrelevant to most people but for somebody who freaks out a lot when the battery on my phone is less than 90%,  the high top tables against the wall with outlets was a great plus! Oh yeah, the service is great too.  It's quick, to-go orders are quicker and phone-in orders are quickest.  The steak souvlaki is tender and has great flavor.  It comes with Greek salad and you can get it with either rice pilaf or fries.  What I always get is the beef and lamb gyro and feta fries.  Soft and warm pita bread hugging slices of meat topped with melted feta cheese and tzatziki...underneath lettuce, tomatoes and red onions.  It's heavy yet portable and non-messy.  I can eat their gyro hot or cold.  Raw onions give me a headache but theirs is sliced rather than chopped so it's easy for me to just pick them out.  The feta fries are amazing.  Each fry is lightly breaded for that extra crisp.  Hot fries topped with feta cheese = cheesy goodness!  \"I'll be there someday, I can go the distance I will find my way, if I can be strong I know ev'ry mile, will be worth my while When I go the distance, I'll be right where I belong\"  - Michael Bolton",

Their gyros have incredibly moist and tender meat, crisp veggies, yummy tzatziki and blanket soft pita bread. The feta fries are a great mix of crunchy, salty and tangy. Their rice bowls are really good too!   If you come during busy times, you may have trouble finding seats. It can get packed as they only have limited seating inside. They do have an outdoor seating area but it's probably not the best during the summer. You know, Vegas heat.   They have the whole Greek vibe going with the music and decor. You can call in orders for pick up as well. Friendly service every time.   It's probably a good thing that they're not too close to where I live or work, otherwise I'd find myself there three times a week!",

If you are looking for Mediterranean food, and not wanting to wait a while, but still get awesome food, this is the place for you. It's an order and pay first, then they bring you your food and you can peace out as soon as you devour your last falafel. Which is sometimes just what you need from a restaurant. Waiting for the check is such a pain sometimes.    The food.  Falafel Pita: dang. I'm a sucker for a falafel pita and do I they do it so well here.  Greek salad with chicken: Okay. Greek salads aren't easy to mess up. They are pretty simple. The two most important things that you can mess up are the dressing and the protein. (As long as you have good produce, you're golden.) The dressing and the chicken were so amazing. The chicken is seared on the grill and served like a kabob on top of your salad. And the whole thing is just fantastic all together. One of the best Greek salads I've had.   Feta fries: So these are amazing. But what send these over the top compared to others I've had is 1. The crispness of the French fries and the fact that they use mozzerella and feta on the fries. So you get that creaminess of the feta and the stingy melted mozzerella that makes the French fries stick together. SO GOOD.   I absolutely adore this place. Go there if you like Greek food, go there if you aren't sure you like Greek food, and go there if you think you hate Greek food. Because chances are you haven't had Greek food as good as this.",

My go to is the Greek salad with gyro meat. Occasionally switch it up and get grilled shrimp which is always cooked to perfection (many places over cook shrimp) Chris always gets the gyro, which by default comes with feta on it, which i love - lots of places don't include feta by default. Feta fries!!! Amazing. Their pita is always warm & the taziki sauce js in point!  Simply the best!",

I am currently 5 months pregnant & I am even more in love with the Great Greek. It's the only full meal I can enjoy and still want to eat the leftovers.  The Taziki is the best. I've tried to make it homemade. Don't even try. It's not the same.  The mamas rice pudding is so good I need to my own because don't like to share with my hubby. Lol   The honey & Greek yogurt is amazing as well! It's not even normal. Haha.   Seriously The restaurant place ever!   Macro friendly if you focus on the proteins & taziki (Greek yogurt).   Xoxo!",

Fries were decent but overall I think the other greek joints were better. Maybe its because I ordered the burger and not the gyro or plates.",

The young lady engaged in conversation inquiring what we have in NY. There is a modest selection of wine and beer that made the meal complete. We stumbled upon this gem from Yelp.",

    "text": "Came here after shopping around at Costco. We ordered the gyro plate with feta fries and a rice bowl to go.   The mini salad that came with the gyro plate was BOMB. Just be careful for the olives... they still have seeds in them and you could easily break a tooth if you aren't paying attention. I loved the feta fries because they had a nice crunchy coat/soft center with a strong garlic taste. I recommend not ordering this if you plan on going out afterwards because your breath may stank.   I think each dish was hovering around $10 to $12 range which was not too bad considering the decently large portion sizes and fresh ingredients. The meat was quite tender and flavorful which was a huge plus.   The guy working the register today was a cool dude. Very customer service savvy and eager to serve the patrons of the restaurant. All in all, I would recommend people to come check out this place especially if you are craving some fresh greek food.   I haven't tried the wraps at this location, but that is on my list of things to try here.",

Not knowing what to expect. Hoping that it will be decent at least. We ordered the chicken kabob, rice and salad. The portions were large. Salad was placed in a separate container. Which kept it crispy and fresh. Chicken was tender and so good. Overall so pleased by the results. We took a chance and so happy we did. They had my order ready and they even made me my own personal dressing for the chicken. Loved loved the food. Thank you for not disappointing. We will definitely return once we come back in town.   Only negative thing I have to say was. Google maps has a different directions then where it was actually located. But wasn't hard to figure  out the mistake once we arrived. But yet confusing especially from a non local.",

Also comes with pita bread and your choice of rice/fries. GO WITH THE RICE! I mean, I'm carb conscious and all... but their rice is worth it.  Service was great. Super friendly and smiles all around.

Saw them on several tables and it was a done deal. Thank goodness after a few my craving was satisfied and I moved on to the real food. The chicken souvlaki plate was more than tasty. The two chicken skewers of marinated chicken breast were moist and tender. The rice pilaf was seasoned perfectly and side salad was delish with a more than generous side salad, romaine lettuce, too, no iceberg lettuce here! My hubby had the chicken bowl which he said was excellent.  Bascially,  it was a Greek salad with a skewer of chicken breast served over a bed of rice. We also sampled some hummus, which was also flavorful.  It was presented in a little bowl topped with  several garbanzo's and sprinkled with paprika. My only comment was that the grape leaves were bland.  A tad more seasoning would be helpful. The were presented beautifully and again the portion size was generous.  This family run restaurant has personalized excellent service. Very friendly and helpful!  Parking is easy, close and free,  can't beat that!   Next time we're in the area we will be back and I'll see if I can be strong and not yield to the temptation of the feta fries!",

A roasted eggplant puree with garlic,  olive oil, lemon juice, tomato and onion served with some pita bread. It was delicious!  - next I had a beef lamb gyro. It is loaded up with meat, tzatziki, onion and tomato on a pita. A nice portion had me filled up in no time. I got the combo which came with your choice of soup, salad, fries or feta fries. I had the feta fries and glad I did. These were very good.",

Lady apologized and said it's still being cooked and it should be ready in a few minutes.  I got up and said to the cashier to cancel the rice and to just order me a side of the shrimp skewer since I really liked it and will pay for the difference.  Cashier said to me that since it's their fault, they won't do a refund on rice but instead to just give me the shrimp skewer without charging me the difference.  Because she took ownership of the mistake and a few minutes later, the shrimp came, I WILL DEFINITELY COME BACK TO THIS PLACE.   That cashier has a great attitude.  Thank you!",

That is a good thing for them, but not so good for the poor business guys that walked in and were desperate for a table.  I get it though. The place is yummy!  I had a gyro and their fries covered in feta and my friend had a plate with gyro meat. The is the real deal. Right off the spit. Doesn't get much better.  Service wise, they were very nice.

There is absolutely nothing about this spot that I don't love. If you're eating in, the feta fries are delicious. I wouldn't really recommend the fries for delivery, but you can have anything else delivered without a problem. The fries tend to lose their crisp during delivery, but that's just what happens to fries and it's not something the restaurant can do much about. I get my delivery through GrubHub, I don't think the restaurant offers it themselves.",

The guy who took our order was very friendly and he  immediately made my visit a little bit more enjoyable. Both my friend and I got the great greek gyro which comes with lettuce, tomatoes, red onions, tzaziki sauce and feta cheese. I made it a combo and got the regular fries and a drink. The food came out quickly and just looking at it made my mouth water. The gyro is a good size, the meat was flavorful and the tzaziki sauce and feta added just the perfect amount of a cool, creamy contrast. I was pleasantly surprised that the french fries were hot, crispy and didn't taste like frozen potatoes.   This is a great place to get some Greek food in the Henderson area and I would highly recommend checking this place out.",

The chicken and lemon rice soup in brilliant, as are the beef lamb gyros and falafel.  Reasonable prices and a great clean Greek atmosphere sharpen its appeal.  And best of all, it's a family owned place where you can be greeted by the friendly and knowledgable mother son team daily.",

That being said, The Great Greek offers a clean, affordable, welcoming and most importantly, DELICIOUS dining experience. Immediately walking into the restaurant, you can sense the meticulous family touch that is all over the place, from the service, to the ambiance.   The food is not a wallet buster, which is an additional plus given the quality of the food. I am a frequent consumer of the chicken rice bowl. Freshly prepared, with fresh ingredients, you really can't go wrong.  I recommend The Great Greek frequently to my peers and friends. They have always treated me well, and I've always left full, and satisfied. Definite must try.",

It's one of those great Mom n' Pop places that is small and quaint.  Tonight we stopped in to eat, place was packed as usual.  We followed right behind another customer coming in to order.   My husband and kids sat down at an available table while I waited my turn to order.  When it was my turn to order, the cashier told me that my family needed to get up from the table.  I could hardly believe what I was hearing.  I asked to verify, \"you want my family to get up from the table?\" She replied \"yes\" and said \"the people that pay get the table and that my family needed to move.\"  I couldn't even speak, I was so blown away!  I wasn't even given a chance to order and \"pay.\"  The entire restaurant was witness to this!  How humiliating!  We ended up just walking out.  It is very unfortunate as the food is great, but I will spend my money elsewhere!",

FOOD I made my order into a combo and chose a side of fries over the salad (not this time, lettuce). The combo also comes with a drink which I wasn't aware of, because I'm accustomed to dining at Greek and Mediterranean restaurants that normally charge extra for beverages.  +Falafel Pita: Hummus, shredded lettuce, diced onions and tomatoes, and ground falafels all wrapped in a soft, warm pita and topped with a pepper. To say that it was \"good\" would be an understatement, so just look at this photo instead: (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=BJO8YVuJQo1jVeyGoDovuw&userid=epkRB3J_oBEiyiwahvdmGg\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>).   One of the main reasons why I like Great Greek's Falafel Pita is that It's easy to eat. Unlike the ones from other Greek and Mediterranean restaurants I've eaten at, Great Greek breaks down the falafels, thus making it easier to consume. I couldn't help but think, \"Duh, why didn't anyone think of this sooner?!\" while I was eating my pita. It just makes sense! Breaking down the falafels saves me time from having to unwrap my pita and eat my falafels with a knife and fork.   +French Fries: Originally, I wanted to order a side of Feta Fries, but taking into consideration that this was my first time dining at this establishment, I stuck with my combo's fries. Deep fried, golden brown, and crunchy, the fries are delicious as they are. I can only imagine how wonderful they would taste like with crumbled feta cheese on top.   SERVICE Restaurants where the employees greet you with a smile are a plus in my book. When I first walked in, I was welcomed by the kind lady working at the counter.  The food here is quickly made and served right to your table within 10 minutes, so you won't have to wait too long to eat.  OVERALL Their Falafel Pita combo has won me over, and now I *have* to try everything on their menu, as well as their baklava that's displayed right there on the counter, ready to be consumed.",

Some people don't do Greek food right, but these guys are great, they run a solid restaurant.  Five solid stars.",

    "text": "All I can say is there is not one dish you will not regret ordering.  Been coming here since the first week they opened a little over a year ago. (Can you tell by all the Yelp photos I eat here alot?? )    Ambiance/Service -Casual, family friendly, modern decor, bright & clean, indoor & outdoor patio seating, place order at counter. If I could I would  give the staff of Great Greek more than  5 stars for service. From the first time I stepped foot when they opened,they have always been welcoming, warm and friendly.  They greet their regular customers by first name when they walk in and leave. Really impressive.  Food: Yia Yia's Pasticcio a Greek style lasgna that's topped with Greek Bechamel is a very popular dish to order here so if you want a slice of savory goodness I'd get here early for lunch.  If you make your meal a combo, get the Feta Fries!!!! Crisped golden fries topped with Feta cheese that's melted slighty. A different and delicious twist to eating french fries for sure!    Everytime  I order a Gyro and take a pic and post it, my friends are jealous cause here I am sitting having this huge Gyro that's filled with tender slices of beef(they also have choice of lamb and chicken)  feta cheese topped with a genourous amount of  their Tzaziki sauce that's made from scratch. Real light refreshing taste. Their Tzaziki sauce is gold!!   Ohhh the Grilled Garlic Shrimp is another plate that stands out. Shrimp is plump, jumbo size, it's an insanely garlickly & buttery masterpiece.  The Chef behind all these delicious dishes worked for notable chefs on the Strip. So you are in for a real treat when you dine here!   I must not forget dessert!! The most important meal  I never ever miss ;)  You cant beat Yia Yia's Rice pudding to top of your meal!!  Im not a big puddin fan but after Chef came over with a sample of rice pudding for me to try, I can say I am fan of rice pudding!! At least  the way Alice makes it here. What sets it apart is  it's creamy but has an amazingly light texture, with hint of cinammon.   Enough said. Don't pass up this comforting dessert.  The proof is in the puddin'!   Great food, great people, Great Greek lives up to it's moniker.",

    "text": "I think my rating would be closer to 3.5, but I rounded up instead of down because I really enjoyed the food.  It is a small family-owned restaurant in a strip mall, close to Sunset Station.  This place is really close to my apartment, and since it was highly rated on Yelp, my boyfriend and I chose to go here to satisfy a craving for gyros.  We called our order in to go ahead of time, and the lady said it would be ready in 15 minutes.  When we got to the restaurant, we waited in line for a bit, and got to the counter -- only for them to tell us they didn't have our order in the system and didn't remember taking it.  This interaction threw me off a little bit, because the lady who took our order on the phone only 30 minutes before was the one telling us that we must have dialed the wrong number.  She had us show the call history on my boyfriend's phone to make sure we called the right number.  What other number is there to call???  She did apologize though (after trying to verify that we, indeed, talked to her and not another employee), and gave us a free piece of baklava.  That was nice.  It was too sweet for my boyfriend, so I ate pretty much all of it (yum).  As for the food, it was extremely tasty and fresh.  My boyfriend had the lamb gyro with feta fries.  He thought the gyro was great; the fries would have been better if the feta cheese could have melted into the fries instead of sitting on top of it.  My order was the gyro plate with rice pilaf, which was excellent.  The rice was seasoned great and the gyro was delicious.  It was actually a lot more than I could eat and ended up being two meals for me, which is pretty good for a $10 plate.  It also came with salad, which is another meal in itself.  The phone situation was pretty offputting, but the food is good enough and this place is close enough that we'll probably make this our go-to locale for Greek food.  Perhaps we will just order in person instead.",

The Greek salad is delicious and very refreshing. The pita bread and tzatziki is super yummy and the fries give it just the perfect crunch. A local family owns and runs the business and takes great pride in their work. It is kept immaculate and is very welcoming!  This place is a keeper.",
