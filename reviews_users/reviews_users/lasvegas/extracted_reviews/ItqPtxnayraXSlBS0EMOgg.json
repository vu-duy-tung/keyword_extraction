I almost pulled the trigger and ordered breakfast, but I had to go back to work and I didn't want to be in a food coma. So, I opted for the turkey melt. It was so good!!! The good food came with great service (thank you Lisa)!  Great spot for breakfast or lunch, but she told me they close at 2:00. I'm coming back for sure.",

This is Rachel's favorite dish on the menu so I couldn't pass it up. The pancake dippers are bit like French toast dippers in size at all. It's a full piece of bacon with batter poured on it. So I felt dipper wasn't a True rep.   The music was a bit much for me on volume with all the rest of the visual stimulation though.",

I wish they sold them in a larger quantity cause 3 rings just wasn't enough (yes I know I could order more than just one).  The food tasted very fresh and delicious. My husband really enjoyed his MTO breakfast and actually enjoyed the turkey bacon and chicken sausage (that says something for someone who seems to be allergic by anything that is not pig or cow origin). I had to taste the mash browns that tasted just like it sounds - mashed potatoes texture with a crispy hashbrown exterior.   I opted for the avocado omelet - great as well with tomatillo sauce which I think may be made on site (or it just tasted really fresh). The only item I wish would have been included with my meal would have been toast - that was not included.   Staff was great and the GM Donna was very attentive and polite. Talked with my husband for a bit and shared her favorite items from the menu. Definitely will come back - we'd return for the fried Apple rings alone.",

Scrambled eggs with chorizo and pequillo peppers and avocado! Served over a potato mash which is a creamy hashed brown potato! It was awesome!    Lemon poppy seed pancake with blueberry ginger compote- This was great as well! Not too sweet and the flavor profile works!   Kentucky Fried Chicken- 2 eggs any style with a piece of fried chicken smother in bacon gravy served over the potato mash. Again was impressed with the flavor chicken was crisp and juicy and the gravy was delicious!   [Drinks] Bottomless Mimosas ($20)- Worth Every penny! More champing than OJ. Just the way I like it!",

We had the Hero which was full of flavor and packed with protein. Grilled Cheese had Brie with honey and walnut sauce which was my absolute favorite definitely something I will be getting next time! We also had the New England Clam Chowder which was a bit too thick, but still jam packed with flavor, it would be wonderful for a cold day.   Our servicer Steve was very nice, refilled our glasses when needed, and was professional.  The GM Micheal came to our table and asked us how our food was, we started to converse with us.  He was very nice, and personable!  I will come back and visit the Summerlin location as well. You can not go wrong with this little diamond in the rough.",

The Fried Apple rings were just an added bonus to this delectable meal. The chicken was crispy even though it had gravy on it. The gravy had a nice consistency and flavor. Did not hide the flavors in the breading of the chicken and was great. I recommend sharing a few plates and ending on the savory. Delicious and will definitely come back.",

    "text": "I recently visited MTO for an impromptu Sunday brunch.  This place really excels in the areas of ambiance, service and design. It''s located in the Parking Bureau across from city hall, and it seems like there's not a bad seat in the house. The restaurant is literally in a glass house, which makes for great people watching. They even have USB outlets at each booth to charge your phone, which my friend and I both needed. I got the impression that the wait staff regarded us as a curiosity, though they really had no reason to; there were already Australians dining a couple tables over.  The food was a mixed bag. We started with \"bacon pancake dippers,\" which turned out to be totally sufficient. The pancakes were very much of the American style - light, airy, fluffy, and likely out of a box. The bacon was excellent and perfectly cooked. The downfall of the dish was the ice-cold maple flavored corn syrup that they served with it. A place known for its pancakes really shouldn't be serving that sort of saccharin hippopotamus wallow, and you certainly can't enjoy a dry pancake.  My friend made a solid choice in ordering the 5-cheese macaroni and cheese. It was very wet and creamy, so much so that I suspect they cook it with coconut oil instead of butter - a suspicion that is corroborated by the fact that they have #vegan options on the menu. It had an excellent flavor and was not oversalted.  The lack of eggs Benedict on the menu resulted in me sending the waiter back three times until I settled on the black & bleu burger - a selection that I would quickly come to regret. The fries were fine, and the mayonnaise was top drawer.  My burger was cooked perfectly medium and was aptly seasoned. It comes with plenty of arugula, grilled onions, Gorgonzola cheese and a blueberry glaze almost as good as the late night experiment that flooded my house back in law school. I enjoy a Roquefort cheese, which is what I expected when I placed the order, but Gorgonzola has always tasted strongly of Windex to me, so I had to take all of that off. The burger was tepid, and the bun left something to be desired. It was too sweet - somewhere between a Wendy's bun and a Hawaiian roll. I couldn't have had more than three bites as the residual taste of cleaning product had curbed my appetite at that juncture.  There was one noteworthy peculiarity about the restaurant. Each time the waiter returned to our table, he uttered the phrase \"breakfast and lunch all day\" in a casual Tracy Turnblad \"love your hair, hope you win\" deadpan; however, this couldn't be further from the truth since the entire restaurant closes at 2pm, causing us to feel rushed.  Overall, I have to conclude that MTO is not exactly worth the trip, but if you're downtown paying a parking ticket anyway, it is a solid choice for lunch. Just remember to order the macaroni and cheese.",

So I left and went to Bar + Bistro at the Arts Factory where they have a very dog friendly covered patio and bottomless mimosas during Sunday brunch.  Restaurants should NOT advertise that they allow dogs if they're not willing to make basic accommodations.",

What I like about this place is that every time I go, they cater to my wife and her eating choices. Tho its not on the menu, they always make her a vegetarian sandwich and it makes her happy.   Gotta love a place that serves coke products!!  Also, if you choose to go here, be prepared to eat a meal in one of the loudest settings possible. I can't explain it, but this place gets amazingly loud with a combination of hipsters talking about wearing beanies in the summer or whatever they talk about, a large wait staff taking orders and a kitchen full of pots and pans crashing around. So don't expect to have a good conversation here.",

I literally crave those darn lemon poppyseed pancakes. It's truly a curse. I gave in to the dark side and there is no going back for me now. Muahahahahahah! I also really enjoy the mini honey doughnuts, although they've been doughy both times. The first time we actually sent them back because they were so undercooked. But none of that stops me from loving every little bit of this place. This last time we went I had the MTO breakfast. Everything was perfect and just the right amount of each item. Of course if you try to finish it all you will definitely be fully nourished.(All depending on your size of course...I ate too much!!) If I remember right it was 2 or 3 eggs, bacon, spam, turkey bacon, mash browns and bread. Oh yah, and chicken sausage which I was not a fan of. Luckily my father in law ordered the lemon poppy seed pancakes so I could still get my fix.   The decor is some of my favorite. Very modern and eclectic. The whole place actually has a very LA feel to me. We all enjoyed the atmosphere even though the music was pretty loud that day. I don't like having to raise my voice to someone who is half a foot away from me, ha.   Excellent service both times and great food! I will continue to make it downtown for breakfast as long as they don't get rid of those pancakes. We might have some serious issues if that happens!",

I told him we would never get to the betting windows before the 10am games began. A quick search of yelp yielded MTO Cafe.    There was only a few people in the place at 8:30 AM.  We sat at the counter and both had Chicken and Waffles.  It was very good.  They used a country gravy and served the Chicken and Waffles like a sandwich.  Nice presentation, good food.   The gravy and the chicken could use a bit more seasoning, but overall it was a filling meal.  I noticed the staff prepared everything after it was ordered.  They were very busy filling \"to go\" and Uber food orders.  Obviously this place has a local following and is not relying on tourists.   They have some alcohol and serve Coke products.    If you are in a hurry you might find MTO cafe is a expeditious alternative to lines on the west end of the casino district.  Weekdays are likely a busy time with City hall across the street.",

They even validate parking! ($1.50 off, so you might end up paying 75 cents for an average length brunch)  The place is bright, inviting, and clean. The food is hit or miss.   Drinks: The coffee is delicious and bottomless mimosa deal is killer at $15. Between their two vegetable/fruit juices, I liked the green juice more than the red. The flavor of the green juice is more citrusy and refreshing.   Treats: The apple rings are tastier than the donuts. Apple rings are perfectly fluffy with tender apples inside, but the donuts are dense, dry, and lack flavor. More like biscuits than donuts.  Lunch menu: I wasn't crazy about the Hero sandwich, but the Caesar wrap was pretty good and the fries are awesome.   Brunch menu: We tried the waffle with berries and chicken MTO omelette. I wish the omelette had been served with a side of something more interesting than just plain raw spinach and Roma tomato slices. Both items were pretty good, but not outstanding.  I would go back to try the vegan carrot pecan pancakes and to have the apple rings again! It's a very pleasant place for a leisurely brunch without a long wait time at 11:30 on a Saturday.",

I had the Bacon Pancake Dippers (pancakes with a slice of bacon cooked into the middle) and these were by far the best pancakes I've ever had a restaurant!!  I always criticize pancakes at restaurants because I don't understand why they can't make them the way I grew up eating them. MTO's pancakes are the closest to homemade that I've had at a restaurant -- my search is finally over, I'm in pancake heaven! .  The Mash Browns are a delightfully different approach to plain old hash browns.  They have a thin layer of mashed potatoes in between two layers of traditional hashed browns -- they exceeded my expectations; they were flavorful and the texture was just right.   I will be back and I'm bringing reinforcements (the fam) next time! LOL",

After leaving 3 other restaurants that were closed for Easter Sunday I was a little annoyed. The hostess here is one of the friendliest hostesses I've come across. I didn't even mind waiting 15 minutes for a table even though I'm already running late. I heard about the green juice so I decided to give it a go. It's definitely different , but refreshing. My boyfriend suggested I order the chicken in a waffle. I should know myself already and know that I ordered something similar elsewhere and didn't enjoy it. me. Right after ordering it I wanted to change my order but I didn't want to be a bother. The chicken was partially breaded and way overdone and dry. The gravy was boring and waffles mediocre. The fruit on top was the only part I enjoyed. My boyfriend had the MTO breakfast. Can't go wrong with meat eggs and potatoes. We sat by the bar and watched them put the final touches and garnishes on the dishes and preparing drinks. Overall the decor is eclectic and atmosphere is laid back. Just because I didn't enjoy my dish doesn't mean I won't come back. I should have known I wouldn't like it as I've had chicken and waffles before elsewhere and didn't enjoy the combination. I should have went with the thanksgiving burger. Oh well next time.",

I ended up with the poppyseed pancakes with blueberry-ginger compote. It was large enough for two meals and it was delicious. My friend got the vegan carrot-coconut pancakes so I got to try them too --- they were so fluffy and yummy too. I also ordered the green juice and it was so GOOD. I think the best I've had yet. The service was good. I wish there was a MTO's in Portland. My only regret is that I couldn't stay long enough in Vegas to try out the whole menu. If you are into fresh healthy and delicious and creative food, don't miss MTO.",

He split our omelet onto two plates with great presentation. The restaurant itself is clean and the decor is very modern with fun music playing.   We stopped by the next day to grab a coffee to go and again the service was great and the coffee delicious.  Will definitely be back to try out their brunch with bottomless mimosas!",

Everything is made well, and I love their sandwiches. They have some fun dishes worth trying, especially the ones on the sweeter side if you're in need of a treat. I'm only ever really underwhelmed by the salads, which can always be improved with some additions or subtractions, but its nice to have easy healthy options here too!",

It doesn't have the best location for locals but great for people traveling and wanted to place to eat off the Strip. Greeted almost immediately by both a host and our waitress. The menu has a great list of items even took a few to decide which one I wanted. I choose the steak and eggs, with fresh toast. The steak was good, toast was a little burn, and the eggs were awful. The waitress did replace them but by then I made peace with not having eggs. Plus my food was mostly gone. I also ordered French toast which was good, but don't have a picture of cause it came late. The waitress forgot I ordered them. But I will definitely go again.",

    "text": "So went there with high hopes based upon reviews. Was really disappointed. The place itself was really nice with the decor and atmosphere. The first server that saw us came and sat us, then two other servers came and asked if we had been helped. That may seem like good customer service, but the way that they acted it was as if there was no server rotation. Watched the same server take the next two tables while the other servers were doing side work. As we were leaving two purple came in to eat at 1 pm and the same server we had said they closed in five minutes even though anything I saw said 2 pm.  Now in regards to the food, a single mimosa shows on the menu as $5.95 but the actual price on the ticket was $6. That may not seem like a lot but when they sell thousands that adds up. The lemon poppyseed pancakes did not have any lemon flavor to them, I ordered a burger and it was bland and overcooked. The fries had no salt on them what so ever. Would not eat here again.",

On both occasions the server (same one for both visits) takes forever to even acknowledge that we are seated and take our drink order...once we get our drink order is in its another very long and frustrating wait for the drinks to finally come and both times she has failed to bring my girlfriend her drink and ive had to get up and hunt down a server to ask again and again for the rest of the drinks...once they finally get around to it and we have all our drinks then comes the food...now the food used to be a big thing for me up until recently...you can tell the care put into each plate is no longer a concern as the flavor is now lacking and the food appeal is now disappointing...after ALL this im assuming who is one of the owners comes and makes it a point to grab our bill to see what we left as a tip but did not remove the bill from the table instead just opened it and looked at it, closed it then walked away...needless to say mine and the groups ive brought into this establishment wont be coming back.",

I've only visited here twice but both times I enjoyed the meal and atmosphere very much.    On my last visit I had BLTAE, (Bacon Lettuce Tomato  Avocado Eggs)and delicious and messy, but messy in a good way.  It was a creative combination of ingredients that tasted really good.  Should just be renamed the Best Lettuce Tomato Avocado Ever, lol.   My partner in foodism had the Cobb salad which was huge with tons of goodies.   On my first visit I had the the chicken waffles which was also very good.   So if your looking for some solid good food, try this place.   Oh one more thing the free yelp cookie,  I figured it be just a plain old cookie, nope, it came out warm, very nice touch.",

My vanilla latte was good, but was warm and not hot when I received it.   Bonus: you get validation for the parking garage  Edit: parking. Validation was only for 2hrs and we were there longer bc of slow service. So still had to pay the difference in parking",

We brought my mom here for brunch to celebrate her birthday. From start to finish a GREAT experience. Brandon, the manager as AMAZING! He was very attentive from checking in with us during our wait for a table to fit our party, to making sure everything went well with our meal to conversing with my mom and joking with her for her birthday. Sierra, our waitress, was also AMAZING!! She was very knowledgeable and accommodating to my 2 year niece who was also with us.   This may seem like a given, however, it does not happen 100% of the time that not only does your food arrive hot, but also that the complete order is CORRECT without having to send anything back. With us having a vegetarian, someone who is highly allergic to dairy, someone on a low sodium diet, and a 2 year old, Sierra handled it gracefully and made sure to check in a few times to ensure everything was okay, she even participated in us surprising my mom with a cake and singing happy birthday!!   Thank you Sierra & Brandon for an amazing customer service, great conversation and delicious food! You guys truly made my mother feel special during our meal. :)   We will be back soon!  #BodyBuilderSkillet   #BaconPancakeDippers  #5CheeseMac&Cheese  #Pancakes  #BriocheToast  #VeganCarrotCoconutPancakes #CreamyAlfredoPasta   #CafeLatte  #FruitBowl",

Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of choices inside the Nugget complex and along the raucous back alley aka \"The Fremont Street Experience\" but I wanted something healthy and off-site. MTO Cafe was just a few blocks away but it might as well have been in another city. The decor inside was loft-like -- tall and spacious with a window wall facing the street that let in lots of natural light. The open kitchen in the back featured an orchestrated food performance, on par with Cirque -- OK, maybe a little less surreal!   The service was pleasant. The menu had plenty of choices, including fresh juices and egg specials for guys like me who are going Keto (high fat, moderate protein and low carb). I got the Body Builder Omelette both days I came along with a Green Juice one day and an MTO Juice the other. The food was fresh and delicious, seasoned just right and served in a little cast iron skillet which kept everything warm as I ate. I consider MTO to be an oasis of sorts. So close to the action and yet something I just know I'll come back to whenever I'm in Las Vegas. Guys -- keep it up and may you remain in business for a long, long time.",

They didn't have the triple stack batter, so the waitress recommended the red velvet with the chocolate sauce and strawberries on the side.  My lil' one loved it.  My son got the waffles with chicken.  He is smiling!  I have the fried chicken...delicious.  Parking is wired down here but it is walking distance from the Plaza and Golden Nugget.",

The interior is spacious, modern and open. I didn't feel like like I was elbow to elbow with other patrons. I guess traveling to places where real estate is much more expensive and most restaurants are tiny and claustrophobic has made me appreciate the spaciousness of many restaurants locally.    I had the hen house wrap with fries and the red juice. The juice was excellent with a unique flavor inspired by beets, carrots and red pepper. The hen house wrap was a simple chicken wrap that was surprisingly flavorful.  The husband had a plate full of breakfast foods consisting of turkey bacon, hash browns, eggs and spam. Everything was fresh and prepared as requested. The service was attentive without being overbearing. I will be back to sample more of their delicious menu.",

It's a nice little spot, Ally was our waitress today and she was super energetic and awesome to have. She made sure we were doing good, never left us hanging and was just an overall joy to be around. I definitely recommend this place for anyone looking for some great food and amazing service. I'm excited to come back and try the rest of the menu!",

Hubby ordered (forgive me I forget exact name) the BLTE (I think it's called). He did enjoy this but thought the pesto was strange even tho it had good flavor. Just felt like it was trying to hard to be more than it is. I had the hangover burger. It was very disappointing. I ordered it medium and it came out well done. The egg was well done which kills the whole point of an egg on a burger and the richness of the yolk. It was also lacking any seasoning. The fries were really good. Loved those. The free cookie with yelp check in was good. We opted for the lemon poppyseed blueberry pancake. Hubby liked it. I didn't like it at all. Had a lemon grass under tone that tasted muddy to me. Wasn't light and fluffy and sweet. It was bitter and oddly chewy (did sit under lamp a while).   Again. Horrible? No. Great?  Nope. There are better places to spend money (Dupars was just down street and food was very good comfort food). You won't hate MTO so I'd say it's worth giving them a chance. But for me they had theirs.",

When I came in the door, I was seated right away. Thank goodness I came at a good time, as the place was completely packed when I left an hour later. Oh and they have counter seating for us \"solo diners\", which was great.   I ordered coffee, which was delicious, and in a very generous mug, and the pineapple mint mimosa. The pineapple and mint was pretty mild, but still very delicious. I also ordered the steak and eggs, which comes with toast and \"mash browns\". Simple dish, but was fresh and delicious. Garlic and herbs accompanied the steak and hash browns.  My server/counter attendant Lisa was awesome and personable. I can't wait to come back to try other dishes!",

It's delicious because it's light and not overly sweet. The combination for carrots and coconut is interesting. But it's a large portion. Couldn't finish my 3 huge pancakes. I got some of my boyfriend's Kentucky fried chicken. Yum! I'm sorry but the hash browns in Vegas suck... Except for this one. Delicious! I finished my boyfriend's hash. We'll be back!   Note: It's right across the city hall and the bus station. Park in the street before Main (metered parking) because there's no street parking in the street where MTO is.",

    "text": "Wow..... Were we surprised by this place. Finally a real downtown cafe!!!   We explore various new places to try around Las Vegas on a weekly basis....this week we tried out the MTO Cafe.....well let me tell you we will be back. We arrived early Sunday morning to find that we were the first ones for the day. We were greeted by Matt, one of the owners. He welcomed us and we sat down immediately. The place is  a mix of modern with a retro feel to it. Warm and inviting but very metro.   We were promptly greeted by our waitress and ordered our drinks....the red juice and green juice.  Both were cold and refreshing. The red juice was full of various fruits and vegetables such as beets and pomegranate.  I could have drank a whole pitcher. My partner loved the green juice.  The menu for breakfast was short but still full of plenty of hearty choices to satisfy all. We were tempted by the various sweet donuts ( which we ordered to go eat later on .....they tasted sweet, with powered sugar and honey from Nevada . It was friggin fantastic!!!).  We ordered our meals after speaking with Matt who suggested a few I dishes such as the Kentucky fried chicken, but as tempting as it sounded, we opted for the skillets. My partner had the broccoli with egg whites, cheddar cheese, mushrooms and I think sun dried tomatoes.  The eggs were fluffy and full of flavor. The cheese  was gooey and colorful. I ordered the chicken skillet with eggs, sun dried tomatoes, spinach and turkey sausage. It was just as delicious as my partner's dish. Both were served in a timely manner. Our drinks were refilled and our waitress made sure we were ok a few times.  The atmosphere was full of music but we were able to have conversation without shouting.  We will gladly return to try out the lunch menu.",

    "text": "Saw good reviews for MTO on Yelp and a really reliable food blog (bite and switch), decided to give this place a try for breakfast, and am happy I did. For context and credibility...I'm new to Vegas and so far I've eaten at Eat for breakfast, Honey Salt for lunch, DW Bistro for lunch, Yanaka for dinner, Frank and Fina's Cocina for diner and these are all places I've enjoyed and would eat at again. I'm not a chain gal and would never say that Denny's and IHOP have delicious pancakes. With that said...MTO does make a great pancake. I had the lemon poppyseed pancakes with blueberry and ginger compote (ask for extra compote) and a cup of coffee. The pancakes werent too sweet or oily, almost a muffin consistency. Solid cup of coffee. This is a perfect breakfast in a \"clean well-lighted place.\" The restaurant has a great vibe, a hip, but not pretentious decor, and Mike the owner is welcoming. I'll be back and would like to try out their lunch menu too.",

Everything on the Hangover was excellent.  From the bread to the Fried Egg on top.  I loved how the egg yolk just buttered that burger just perfectly.  The sauce added to the flavor and def. didn't take away from it.  The bacon was perfect.  Not like soggy or overly cooked that you would get from a normal restaurant.  The Fat Elvis was rich and I bet it could keep somebody going all day.  We didn't realize till we ate all of it that it came with a side of syrup and you know we didn't miss it at all.  Thought it came with french fries but I am glad it didn't.  The strawberries that came on top and the side were perfect with it.  Next time we will try it with the syrup on it.  Again the bacon was perfect.  The french toast bread is what I remember my grandma making me when I stayed at her house on the weekends.  I have friends that are vegetarians and vegans so it is nice that this place seems to cater to both the meat eater as well as the health conscience.  They found new regulars with us.",

A great example of everything that can go wrong with vegan cooking: gooey, dense and overly sweet to cover up the extra baking powder. Basically a flat ball of dough on a plate with nothing else on the side. I really don't want to be hard on the place but of all vegan things, vegan pancakes are probably the one thing you shouldn't have an issue making ;)",

Meat was seasoned good, fried egg dripped down my hand when I bit into it (good thing they gave me a nice thick napkin with fancy plastic silverware) and fries were hot and crispy. I had a coupon from eat24 for $2 off so the order came up to $12.05. LOTS of food for the price.",

Regular bacon and spam were of course yummy.  My eggs were cooked as I asked, no complaints there.. so why 4 stars instead of A-OK? The best part of this breakfast was the Mash Browns.. I don't know what that smushy stuff was on them but it was delicious!  Also the sourdough that came with breakfast was just perfect.  Good coffee too - this is definitely a nice brunch spot - worth a trip outside the strip to try something different..",

Parking wasnt free but its discounted. Service was good. The cafe was quaint and modern. Now on to the food. I only had a chance to order the Skuna Bay Salmon Burger. It was topped with balsomic aioli, chopped romaine, cream cheese on a potato bun with fries. I thought it was pretty good. The salmon came out moist and the aioli wasnt overpowering. There may have been too much mayo/cream cheese though but it wasnt smothering. The potato bun was nice and soft. I was pretty full by the end of my burger but wish I had room to try more items on the menu. I will definitely come back.",

We really liked the fried chicken with hash mash and topped with two eggs.  The chicken was really juicy and cooked perfectly.  Everything went well together.  The grilled cheese with brie and honey was also really good.  We got the fries with the grilled cheese and we couldn't stop eating them because they were sooooooo good.  We also tried the green juice which I thought was okay, just a tad pricey for a small glass.  We finished our brunch with the mini donuts and honey which were seved warm and really delicious.

Our waiter promptly brought us our drinks after sitting (coffee).  After that, everything went downhill fast.  We both ordered the $14 MTO breakfast.  We waited 20 minutes for our breakfast.  Sitting next to the open air kitchen, we watched at least 6 party's seated after us receive their food before us.  Every single server there works with blinder's on, so don't expect refills on drinks and the like from anyone other than your server.  All servers there avoid eye contact and all of them walked past our empty coffee cups we intentionally placed at the edge of the bar.  It was almost laughable as servers prepared their drink trays next to our empty coffee cups.  I ordered my 3 eggs scrambled and received 2 eggs fried hard & 1 over-easy...all 3 over-cooked.  I brought this to our waiter's attention and told him that I'd eat them anyway (didn't want to wait an additional 20 minutes for scrambled eggs).  I asked for jelly for my 4 pieces of toast and was given just 1 plastic serving.  My uncle asked for jelly and received the good stuff in a small dish (we shared).  Their hashbrowns are mushy...don't understand how that's possible.  I eventually received coffee refills after throwing dirty looks at the young waitress who brags about also working at the Hard Rock steakhouse.  The manager came by towards the end of our meal and asked how everything was.  I looked him directly in the eyes and replied \"awful\".  He turned his back to me and walked away with no reply.  *Note to locals*  If your considering the MTO special for breakfast here, you'll fair much better at Wildfire with the \"Gambler's Special\" without paying 7x the price (seriously...the Gambler's Special is only $1.99, $2.99 with choice of meat).  The difference (besides the outrageously higher price) is the couple pieces of fruit on a toothpick.  Further, the food and service are much better at Wildfire.  Sitting directly across from the kitchen, we did get a good look at other dishes offered and they looked delicious (especially the wraps).  As much as I'd like to go back, I can't get passed the atrocious service and will never return.",

Staff is friendly and engaging. They have outlets at the booths that are convenient for laptops and getting work done.  Food: My friend had the MTO breakfast platter. According to him it was good. Bacon was cooked perfectly. Although for the price, I was expecting a larger portion size. I got the chicken in a waffle dish. It was good, but I wasn't in love with it. Once again price was a little steep for what you get. There's a lot of great breakfast places in town where the food is spectacular, the portions are large, and the price is cheaper.   On a side note there Mashed potato Hash browns are really really good and unique. Unfortunately I found a piece of hair in them......... Being the person that I am I didn't say anything to the waitress as I could tell she was new and didn't want to give her a rough time.  Overall, place is nice, food is a little over priced. Food quality not bad.  Idk if I would come back here again.",

And they were right. I ordered then hangover burger - medium well - and received a fluffy soft bun, angus burger with bacon, a fried egg, and topped off with what seemed to be bread and butter pickles. The burger was cooked perfectly, and the condiments on the burger enhanced the flavor of the burger itself. The fries are shoestring style, and cooked to perfection.   Now, I love the burger bar. Hubert Keller is my go-to guy for a perfect burger, but MTO seriously gives the burger bar a run for their money. I would definitely return to the MTO cafe. And at $14 it makes the burger bar look ridiculously overpriced. My only complaints is that the waitress refused to separate checks which can make eating out with colleagues for lunch difficult.",

    "text": "Went here with some friends for a birthday brunch.  The location is right by the Las Vegas City Hall and presumably provides dining options in a specific portion of downtown that otherwise lacks options.  The restaurant validates parking for patrons.  The decor is very urban, concrete jungle with industrial looking tables and high ceilings.  The place has a very modern but friendly feel and offers plenty of seating with a properly proportioned dining room.  Service was very good and the waiter made sure those of the patrons partaking in the bottomless mimosas had refills when needed.  I had the MTO signature breakfast which consisted of turkey bacon, spam, sausage, eggs, mash browns and toast.  This was a tasty combination and I'm not a big spam fan from prior experience.  Another member of our group had a chicken wrap which was fresh, and appropriately portioned.  The french fries were shoe string or thin fries and were very good.  The pricing was not bottom basement denny's level but was fair.  This is a great place to go for breakfast, lunch or brunch.  If you hate hipsters and cop an attitude about any place giving a hipster vibe, you should probably go somewhere else.",

I've been here a few times before but I kept forgetting to write a review but my experience today prompted me to do so. First the apple rings...Amazing! Then the orange juice mimosa... Amazing! Last, I tried something new the Huevos Rancheros with mashbrowns...Amazing! It was corn tortilas with scrambled egg on top, which was topped of by salsa and an avocado. I also ordered one lemon poppyseed pancake but it wasn't my favorite. I would recommend this place to anyone that likes good food.",

A moment of humor, when the person who took my order asked if I wanted the wrap as an omelet or a wrap. Hey, it was busy, and he was trying hard.  The wrap was good. It would have been better, if it had more chicken. There wasn't much chicken on a wrap that sells for $14. There was supposed to be a sliced tomato according to the person who took my order, but sadly, not.  I chalk up the \"problems\" as start-up-iris. I'm certain things will be better soon.",

The hostess and everyone in the restaurant were incredibly helpful and Brandon was extra attentive to our needs.

We came here 2 out of the 3 days we were in town...sadly, there were way too many people on the second day we tried to come. But 2 out of 3 ain't bad.  Lots of healthy options at this place, loved the names of the Made To Order breakfasts like Yoga Pants and Body Builder. The food here was just what we needed to fuel us for the 3 days of festival shenanigans; on the healthier and lighter side so we can save the calories for the liquid diet to be had later on.  Service was really great here. Our servers were all really attentive but never overbearing (bc that's the worst)! Really appreciated the non stop flow and constant refilling of coffee. This place does get busy especially this past weekend...not sure how busy they get during other times of the year, but if you want to get seated quickly, make sure to get your ass up and over there before 10am.",

If you're a big eater, you might want to consider something larger.    Also, great service.  This is Vegas after all and we were very dehydrated.

I'm a local trying to support local but the inconsistent service is really a drawback that makes me think twice before going there. The food is always good, that's the one thing I will say.  The service is up and down. For example, there were 4 tables and 2 servers while we were there yesterday and it still took almost a half hour for our food to come out. And that includes a table that was seated after us getting their food before us. No apologies, no discounts, nothing. Just flat out pretended nothing happened.  I think the moral of the story is don't go to MTO hungry. Have a snack before you go because if you show up hungry it is bound to take a ridiculous amount of time to get your food.",

But this spot here, lemme tell you, is right up there with the boujie ass spots in the Bay Area that I go to. Although packed and understaffed without a proper hostess, the servers were able to clear a table and get us seated in a timely manner. Our server, Lisa, was very prompt and efficient with her order taking and tasks, and she did it with a beautiful smile.  Now the food, oh lemme tell y'all about the MF food!!! I ordered the steak and eggs, medium rare and over medium...they came out perfectly. They came with a side of toast and potatoes call \"mash Browns\" which tasted like a crispy rice pilaf. I enjoyed them thoroughly. My girlfriend ordered the eggs and sausage sandwich, which in her words was \"better than eggslut.\" That's high praise IMO. The bottomless mimosas that we ordered kept coming, I couldn't even keep up.  After we finished our \"first course\" we decided to order some of the lemon poppyseed pancakes we saw on their yelp. And ohhhh fuuuuuuuuh they were good.  5 stars well deserved",

Very friendly staff and very chill vibe. I ordered the Lemon Poppyseed Pancakes with the Blueberry Ginger Compote and a side of Bacon and Sunny side up eggs. It was DELICIOUS! I was in a sugar coma for hours!  My boyfriend got the Body Builder as an omelette and that was super tasty as well. The coffee here is also delicious! Will definitely be back to try bottomless mimosas!",

Let me preface this by saying I spent 10 years in hospitality in my 20s as a bartender and restaurant manager and can say this woman was one of the rudest managers I've ever met.   The service was excellent and the food was very good.  They offer a good variety of healthy choices and even have the harden your arteries entrees.   We arrived with 10 people. When asked to be seated we explained being separated wasn't a big deal. The manager came over and began explaining that she won't allow us to sit at the bar all at once cause she won't flood her kitchen and she doesn't run a restaurant like that. She began to keep going on and on about in a very rude and loud voice.      Having been a manager before I understand staggered seating so you don't slam the kitchen but I never was rude to guests.  As close to verbatim as I can remember it she harshly said \"you guys are going to have to wait an hour. I can't sit you all at once and crash my kitchen.  I won't run a restaurant like that. So you guys can wait or go somewhere else\".   Funny thing is the hottest just sat us all at different tables and the orders came In staggered anyway.",

The coffee was very good as well, and they offer bottomless mimosas! The prices were fair, as we spent about $12 less than our breakfast from the previous day and the service was excellent. We will definitely be back next time we are in town.",

And they have a free chocolate cookie with check-in offer which basically sealed the deal for me haha.  I've had the Lemon Poppyseed Pancakes, the Hangover Burger, the Chorizo Skillet, and the Chicken&Waffles, and I can only report back by saying that all of it was AMAZING. The Lemon Poppyseed Pancakes were fluffy and so good with their blueberry ginger compote. Definitely ask for extra of the compote! Everything in the Hangover Burger was just ON- from the runny egg to the medium rare patty to the bacon to the special sauce- it was truly perfection in the form of a burger. The Chorizo Skillet was also delicious with the layer of hash browns sizzling on the bottom of the skillet. The Chicken&Waffles were also solid- tender meat and yummy sauce in a waffle sandwich- what more can you ask for?  The second time I visited MTO, my party was offered free Fried Apple Rings instead of the cookies and boy oh boy were these dank. Seriously, these are a must! The batter was crispy on the outside yet fluffy in the inside and the cinnamon sugar icing was a no brainer. The attentive service and cute decor just makes this cafe even better. Definitely make this place a Vegas pitstop!",

On April 19, 2015, I attended my first supper entitled Korean Brasserie.   This dinner consisted of 6 courses done by different chefs.  The first, the amuse, was by Eduardo Saavedra of MTO Cafe.  It was two fried California gold oysters with seaweed kimchi and Asian pear mignonette.    The second course, salad, was by Daniel Ontiveros of the closed Comme Ca.  It was Gochujang pig ear terrine and white kimchi salad, pickled daikon, and cilantro.  Course three, soup, was by Johnny Church of MTO.  was seared abalnoe mushroom hot pot with \"mirepoux.\"  Course 4, appetizer, was by Brian Howard, Chef/Owner of Grazing Pig Food Group, and consisted of heritage pork tartare tenders and heart, soju pickled bae, and Carolin rice craklin.  Course 5, by Brian Lhee, Executive Chef of Yusho Las Vegas, was Korean hsort rib with tofu cavatelli, sesame leaves, and crispy anchovies.  Dessert, Course 6, was by Ashley Traeger and Meilani Marriott of Hapa Sweeters (coming soon to Las Vegas).  The did two small desserts--Spring green tea mini tart and a matcha green tea panna cotta.  After the meal, the chefs were introduced and each one spoke briefly.  I had a seat at the counter facing the espresso machine and it was perfect.  I got to watch the construction of the dishes and it was great fun watching them do their thing.    Service was excellent, the food was great, and it was a fine evening of supper of a different kind.   Prix fixe is $65 and a reservation is a must.  I look forward to the next Sunday Supper at MTO.",

I didn't get a breakfast meal after all, instead I had the quinoa patty with grilled chicken breast and avocado.  It came with a salad.  Also has a green juice.

We got BOTTOMLESS MIMOSA $20/person, the waitress never stopped refilling it. French toast were good with enough coating.   My favorite: Kentucky fried chicken! The chicken had a light layer of coating with juicy tender chicken inside. You could sub your harsh brown with any side with no additional charge. The gravy though was very interesting, not overpowering with a little bit of sweetness. It is definitely different than usual white gravy but very tasty with the chicken. If I would you, I would order it on the side so the fried chicken will not be soaked.  Overall, I highly recommend this place who doesn't have a lot of budget for high end dining but still has decent quality of food. Per person costs from $10-$25. Not bad.  Oh, I love their music selections!",

It is open with the high ceiling and the wall to floor windows. Has a very casual feel to it that reminds me of my time in LA. I like the choice of bar, booth or table- depending on who you are eating with I guess. The parking garage is sweet--just up above- yet far enough to walk off your meal.They do validate so don't forget to ask.  The service was friendly and quick- they seemed to enjoy their jobs which added to the positive vibe of the place.",

It took awhile to get seated - and then it took a long time just to get water and order!  I also noticed that other tables were waiting a long time to get their orders.  We would've left but had to get back to work - there was no time to find something else.  Once our order was placed,  about 30 minutes passed.  I had to get up and ask the person at the front counter what the status was.  She said another 10 minutes.  After 10 minutes passed, I flagged the waiter down - he literally had to stand by the cooks to ensure my dish was done.  Keep in mind, this place is small - so, it's not like they're going from one end of the restaurant to another - it's easy to see who's not being served.  We received a discount for the inconvenience (they subtracted a drink from our order) but even with this, I won't be going back!  If I could give them a negative rating, I would.",

    "text": "Vegas is a tough place for vegetarians. It's a city that equates meat with success. So I did some research before we went, and chose this place for a nice brunch on my wife's birthday. We were both pleasantly surprised.  We were welcomed warmly by the staff and by a woman who I'm assuming was the manager or owner. When I mentioned that I'd found the place on Yelp, and that it was my wife's birthday, we were offered a complimentary amuse bouche - two tiny walnut tarts.  My wife had the Skuna Bay salmon skillet, and I had the vegan carrot and coconut pancakes. Even though we didn't need them - hers came with home fries, and my meal was already pretty carb-laden - we also ordered a side of these potatoes that melded the best of hash browns and mashed in one dish. Decadent, and necessary.  We also ordered bloody marys, made with Soju, a Korean liquor that's lighter than vodka, so we didn't need a nap when we were done.  Everything arrived quickly, and was consumed with gusto. The food was fresh, inventive and delicious, and the service was attentive without being overbearing. The room has a nice, warm ambiance with plenty of natural light.   Best of all, the place takes its job seriously, but also knows how to have fun. Social media is embedded in the experience, and the tables even offer USB plugs on the wall to recharge your devices.  The short walk to Fremont Street  burned off a few calories. We'll be back for more,",

I loved the Chicken and Waffles, which I've never tried before and they have killer omelettes and pancakes.  Then there's the Fat Elvis.  French Toast with bacon, peanut butter, nutella and bananas.  So good.  The hash browns had me going until I realized they were crispy on the outside and stuffed with mashed potatoes inside.  Wow.  Definitely a must stop-by when dealing with anything downtown.

    "text": "Okay... As a vegan I will never feel comfortable eating here again. My mom and I were in downtown Summerlin yesterday and we were excited to grab dinner here. They had vegan options on the menu... And having tried the tree hugger at the downtown location last summer... I felt compelled to order it again... But lo and behold... A VEGAN falafel started calling my name. I was totally torn. I asked her if they had any nutritional Info for their food. They didn't. I then asked if the treehugger was vegan... I was told it was but they use mayo in the aioli. Good to know because the downtown location told me the sauce was vegan and safe, it clearly isn't if they are using mayo. She then went on to inform me that they fry the vegan falafel in the same oil that they fry their chicken in. Um... Wait what? I had to ask her how this was even possible... And why on earth they would have the nerve to use the word vegan in anything on the menu that was being cross contaminated with animal products. In all fairness... The ingredients uncooked are vegan... But the second they hit that fryer... They are contaminated with fat and oil and enzymes from chicken. It's vegetarian at best... And using the word vegan is a lawsuit waiting to happen (anyone remember the Mcdonalds French fry catastrophe?) I had a salad from here at the beer fest that was most definitely vegan... And it was sooo good. Unfortunately... I will never be eating here again, at least not until they learn proper vocabulary or create a separate fryer.",

In fact this last time, we stayed over an EXTRA NIGHT just so my son could get his fix only to have post-frozen, dry, tasteless, Denny's-type potatoes cubes appear where the mashbrowns should have been. Son, and Mom and Dad, so sad! All other food, service, atmosphere was exemplary as usual. Still one of our favorite places but I will call ahead to see if they have rectified the situation before coming again.

The sandwich was grilled perfectly but I didn't really care for the type of cheese, just my personal preference. My friend had the turkey melt with fries and it was perfect. The portions here are really large, we've had to take half home every time.   The cafe is only open until 2pm, and if you get there between 12 and 1 you will have to wait. The hostess was very nice and attentive, our server the first time was great but the second time (different server) a little brusque and impatient. No biggie, everyone has a bad day sometimes. Both time a managerial type came by to check on us. Beware if you have a hearing problem, the music is really loud and you will get that annoying echo because it is all hard surfaces in there. This is really the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars.   All in all a good breakfast/lunch experience. I like to support local businesses and will be back.",

Has a very Ann Arbor vibe. Coffee was good but not memorable. Ordered the KFC which was tasty and potentially outstanding hangover food (I was sober at the time, mostly) but still light enough to leave room for the Fried Apple Rings which was the real star of the meal in my opinion and the must have item between the two. Worth checking out if you're downtown.",

Bottomless Champagne was delicious and I asked the owner Matt for some extra as he was managing on Saturday.  I will totally come back when I'm in Vegas as it reminds me of NorCal type food and great service. Their iPad was having trouble sending orders and out order didn't go through but they were cool about it! Other than the order not going through they were a little unorganized and only 3 waiters for a busy Saturday and the owner sort of walked around like he did not know what he was doing, I even asked him about where the food came from and he was very unsure and his response was \"I leave it to the chefs\" Food was worth the wait though and I will be back!!!!!!!!!",

    "text": "My wife and I ate at MTO on  a Tuesday morning at 9 AM.  When we arrived, there was nobody else eating the restaurant, which is usually not a great sign the food is going to be good.  However, given the many positive reviews we read, we were willing to stick around and try this place out.  We are really glad we did.  My wife and I each ordered the MTO breakfast which was priced at $14; kind of steep, right? No, not really.  When the food came out, it was a humongous portion of food.  You really have to be hungry finish your meal (which I did).  You get three eggs, 2 large links of sausage, 4 strips of pork bacon, 2 strips of turkey bacon, two pieces of spam fried crispy, 2 slices of toast, and a huge order of hash browns.  Again, a lot of food.    I have to say, this meal was great.  Everything was good; we were not disappointed.  If we lived in Las Vegas, we would visit often to try other items on their menu.  One baffling aspect of this restaurant is that they are only open 8 AM - 2 PM.  Perhaps this is because they are surrounded by the city court complex and city hall areas.  However, I think they could do a stiff happy hour business in the 4-7 PM time-frame.  They should really consider staying open later to boost their business.  I have no doubt they would be busy as their food and service is top-notch.",

When my wife read an article on this place she said I should check it out. I'm glad she did.  My first issue was trying to find parking that was free. It was early on a Sunday morning but the only free spots on the street (still a block from the restaurant) were all taken. MTO is conveniently situated in the bottom floor of a park garage, but inconveniently it cost $3.00.   I got there right at 8:00am and it was pretty much just me and the staff.  I was greeted very nicely and my server was very attentive.  I wanted the Poppy Seed pancakes but also wanted some eggs, sausage and potatoes, Everything is a bit pricey, My bill with coffee (good coffee) for just me was $29 and change!  Add in the tip and parking and it was almost $40 for just me!  I think it is the most I have ever paid for a breakfast, and I have had breakfasts is some great places.  I did get the MTO breakfast that came with assorted meats... (more than I expected or wanted) and the pancakes(3) were big and pretty good.  I am a big guy with a hearty morning appetite but I took half the meat and half the pancakes home and had them the next morning.  It was a very good breakfast, but I don't know I will be back.  The parking cost was a surprise.  (The waitress said they are working with the city to be able to validate).The coffee machine (I think it was) made a terrible shrieking noise every five minutes or so (like crying cats standing off against one another)  that went on much longer than my early morning brain was ready for.    I like good heavy, hearty, crusty European style breads (La Brea Bakery style) and they offered only light weight fluffy types (Wonder bread was actually a menu option!). I ordered whole wheat, (which was thick sliced but also light and fluffy) which I barely touched (I had the pancakes).  I think there are better breakfast placed for much less... and they have free parking.",

The apple donuts are amazing though!  The first experience there was very nice service, and we were a huge group.  The 2nd time was awful.  There were 5 in our party, and the restaurant was only about 2/3 full.  The hostess made us wait for 45 minutes, even though they had a table ready for us.  BUT she said they did not have a server to serve us.  We begged her to just let us sit at the table - we didn't need to order anything until the server was free, but we just wanted to sit down, as there is no seating in the lobby/entrance area.  She said her manager would not allow us to sit, that it was just their policy.  HORRIBLE! Since then I've been to the Downtown Summerlin location for lunch.  The falafel wrap was good.  And my boyfriend's ruben sandwich was amazing.",

The taste is delicious too. They use quality ingredients so you end up with quality tasting food. The staff is friendly and able to make adjustments to the menu items based on your dietary needs. Coffee is very good too.  With all the expensive garbage on the strip, it's nice to see a place like this in the improving downtown area. Hopefully downtown will continue to develop and offer another destination to LV visitors. For the time being, Made To Order Cafe is reason enough for me to visit.",

    "text": "I've heard so many good things about the MTO cafe but just haven't had enough time to go and check the place out in person. So for lunch I went ahead and ordered delivery through Yelp. They took about an hour to deliver my food. I don't mind, its delivery. Though I should have ordered a lot sooner if I knew the wait time.  Since it was my first time eating here, I went ahead and ordered a good amount of food. For starters, I ordered the tomato basil soup. Let me tell you it was pretty amazing. The flavors were just right and the didn't taste like too much tomato. I wasn't too happy about the grilled cheese that came with it though, but I got two servings of soup rather than one so I guess that makes up for it. I saved the other bowl for dinner.   I then had the vegan falafel wrap. The falafel met expectations, though the wrap in general could have had a little bit more flavor. It was pretty dry. The box that it came in had a small side salad which I was pretty excited for after the dryness of the wrap. I looked down and my dressing spilled all inside the box. Didn't look as appetizing as I was hoping. To pair these two items I went ahead and got the red juice. Pretty delicious but a small serving for only $5.  To finish off my meal I had there apple rings. They were very tasty and reminded me of the ones that my mom used to make. The only problem that I had with this was my sauce, again, spilled all over the box so I couldn't enjoy the sauce as much as I would have loved to.  All in all it was a pretty alright meal. The delivery time was okay. The food was ok. The presentation, not so well.  For now, I will give this place 3 stars. I didn't experience any service nor do I know the ambience of the place. I will keep an open mind to my second visit there, where I will actually go to the cafe. Who knows when that will be. Perhaps, even give this place the five stars that everyone raves about.  I do have a tip for the cafe. Either make sure the sauces are fully clothed, or cater wrap the sauces so they don't open. Like you did with the juice.",

    "text": "My family and I were pretty excited to try this place after reading all the reviews. My family went to the outlet mall nearby and I decided to do a nice little 10k run to meet them for brunch (like the brunch running clubs springing up across the U.S.A, but solo). After running from our hotel down the Las Vegas Strip, I arrived ready to enjoy some delicious food.   Walked in to find out they had seating for 67 people (tiny) and the wait was 45 min or so. Not the end of the world, so I ordered myself an iced coffee and went outside to read a book on my phone and enjoy the sun.   We were seated just after 45 in of waiting, so hostess was spot on. We immediately ordered food and beverages as soon as the server came over, as we were famished. What we were not expecting was to wait another 45 minutes for the food to come out. (reason for 1 star deduction).   There service was decent at best. Our server was friendly, but forgot several times when we requested for little things like coffee or water refills, which are all so important when you wait 45 min for food. (reason for another 1 star deduction).   Finally, when the food came, we were not disappointed. WE ordered the Kentucky Fried Chicken which is chicken fried chicken with two free eggs over a pile of Hashbrowns and covered in a country gravy. Delicious and the most unique gravy with hints of cinnamon. The second item we shared was the avocado skilled which is several vegetables mixed with eggs over hash browns with avocado and tomatillo sauce on top. Good, but nothing out of the extraordinary. The third item we shared was the Elvis French toast with Peanut Butter, Nutella, Bacon, banana, and Strawberries. A winner in my book, and pretty stinkin good.   So overall experience I give a 3 star for the long wait for food and the below average service. Their food is delicious but with so many great brunch places popping up, I am not sure if it is worth the wait. This on is up in the air.",

There is enough for both the vegetarian and the carnivore to be happy at MTO.   I enjoyed a nice cappuccino followed by the hero sandwich, which was nearly more than I could finish. The meats and greens were very proportionate to the bread and pesto and it was exactly what I was hoping for. The fries are small and thin style and quite tasty.  The seasonal fruit cup was also colorful and fresh.   The service was friendly and timely. An all around great experience that is well worth getting off the strip for. If you're looking for a good brunch, look no further. It is in an easy to find location near the downtown area with ample parking.  Also, check in on Yelp and get a free cookie for dessert!",

My company that I was dining with also had the lemon poppy seed pancakes, and the Kentucky fried chicken dish. Both dishes were equally as amazing.

All our food was $2-4 more when they bought the check, which is super deceiving and should be told to you when ordering.   Outside of that, this is surely a spot that had great selection. Different types of French toast, omelettes, and food at different levels of \"healthy\" for those that are health conscious.",

The restaurant was not crowded (as it was a weekday) and the service was great. We were in and out in less than 40 minutes. The inside of the cafe was airy and illuminated by plenty of sunlight.   I ordered the Kentucky Fried Chicken breakfast with scrambled eggs and my wife ordered the Body Builder omelet. We really liked that the menu had a mix of healthy and unhealthy options.   The presentation of both dishes left much to be desired. However, they both tasted great! By stacking all parts of the meal on top of each other, they were definitely encouraging me to mix all of the items together. The chicken was juicy on the inside and had a crunchy, well seasoned exterior. The gravy was slightly sweet but still complemented the chicken well.   The Body Builder omelet was even better. I have not seen this particular combination of ingredients for an omelet before, but they all worked together well.   Overall, the food and service were great and the prices are far better than anything you'll see on the Strip. If you are visiting Las Vegas, it is worth the Uber ride if you want a satisfying breakfast/brunch.",

    "text": "Nice breakfast/lunch spot in the downtown area serving up some tasty comfort food using fresh ingredients.  We came here kind of early on a weekday so there weren't that many people in the restaurant which was nice.  I got the Kentucky fried chicken which is a piece of boneless fried chicken with a bacon country gravy, on top of an interesting \"mash brown\" potatoes, and topped with 2 eggs.  The chicken was nice and crispy and the gravy rich.  The potatoes were pretty creative, it's mashed potatoes coated with shredded potato and fried like a hash brown.  The exterior is crispy like a good hash brown but the center is soft and creamy mashed potato.  The dish was pretty yummy.  Mark H got the steak and eggs.  It's a garlic marinated steak with the mash brown potatoes and three eggs, another filling breakfast.  I had a taste of the steak and it was good, flavorful and pretty tender.  The restaurant is in the building with the parking structure for the City of Las Vegas government building.  You can park in the structure and MTO will validate your parking.  One thing to be aware of is there's a guy in a government golf cart type mobile that's constantly on the move looking for parked cars with any kind of violations.  Unfortunately our car's registration was expired (we had the new one in the glove but forgot to put it on) definitely our fault but the guy somehow broke our windshield wiper when putting the ticket on the car....grrrr.",

There are about 8 tables and long tall bar to sit at. But at noon on a Tuesday we didn't have to wait. The service was top drawer. We had a very friendly chica and she was willing to give her opinion on different options.  Kids ate off the kids menu. The 11 year old had chicken fingers that he deemed the \"best he's every had.\" They were definitely of the fresh variety and not frozen. Came with fries.  Daughter had spaghetti that she ate a ton of. It was a nice size portion too.   I wanted a patty melt. In fact, I've been craving one for weeks. But I don't like beef so I asked if they would make me one with turkey. I didn't want the sauce...but they forgot and put it on. Truthfully, it was delicious so I didn't mind. A great burger, very very flavorful. Hubs had the ruben which he devoured. I guess he liked it. :)  This is a spot you should check out if you are ever in the downtown neighborhood.",

We parked in the The city centers parking structure, because I read reviews that MTO validates parking. What I didn't know is that they only validate $1.50; and the total was $3, so we had to pay $1.50 for it, which isn't bad, but I was little taken a back since I thought it'd be free.

There are no just \"eggs any style, bacon, etc\".  I ordered an Avocado omelet, which was delicious. The mash browns as a side was a $2.00 extra charge.

I went in with a couple friends and my girlfriend after a rough Friday night. 15 dollar bottomless mimosas (which the server refilled, even after we overstayed our welcome...) and something they call \"mash browns\" which seem to be hash browns on a bed of mashed potatoes. Both crunchy and creamy (a combination I rarely enjoy) this unique side dish is what I remembered most about MTO.   The decorations are cool, it's definitely a \"hip\" type of bar/brunch place. You're bound to overhear some goatee'd gladhander talk about his worthless sales job, or the blonde bombshell reminiscing about the night she can't remember. Comes with the territory.   Would definitely, definitely eat here again. And drink. And talk. And eat again.  I should mention they gave us free cookies too. Who does that?",

    "text": "Looking at the food coming out of the kitchen,  the sandwiches looked really impressive.  However, i opted to try the breakfast.    The food is very average, nothing really amazing for breakfast.  I ordered lemon poppy seed pancakes with blueberry ginger compote.  Each of my 3 pancakes was unlevened or flat and totaled less the 3/4 of an inch high for the stack of 3. The compote was thin an runny, more of the consistency of a thin sauce. The flavor profile was ok, what was lacking was the execution of technique. However the ingredients were fresh. I will have to try them for lunch hopefully my experience will be better.  For now I will stick to one of my 7 favorite places for brunch.  Cost: $15 pancakes & soft drink+ Tax & Tip $3 + $1.50 for 1 hour of paid parking = $19.50 for below average pancakes with no meat side.    Time: 11 am  Restaurant:  less then 1/2 full.   Service, is friendly yet attention to guest needs improvement. In my observation servers could work specifically on anticipating guest needs.",

The sandwiches and Wraps also taste good, we tried the \"Kentucky Fried Chicken\" and \"The Hero\". Loved them !  Good way to GOO !!  Overall a good Experience !!",

Best breakfast we had in Vegas; the blueberries, strawberries, and blackberries were great accents to our meal, and I loved that they have real lettuce (arugula, greens) versus non-nutritional man-created iceberg lettuce.    This place just opened 2 months ago so it's still relatively unknown by mainstreamers making it fast, quaint, and personable.  It's family run versus corporate and so there's a lot of pride in how this place operates even by staff.    Every booth has outlets that are USB ready.  How convenient!!  Parking is free on the street on Sunday.  Conveniently located next to the Mob Museum, Neon Museum, Fremont Street Experience, and Pawn Stars.",

    "text": "MTO! You're fantastic! Traveling from LA, we stayed in Aria on the strip, but I convinced my friends to brunch in downtown. Most of the other brunch places I called in DTLV had a 30-1 hr wait and I just wasn't down for that (Hash House A Go Go and eat.) Both of those places also didn't let us put our name down over the phone as we were traveling from the strip to downtown (first come first served). MTO had high reviews, but not many, so I assumed it was new and we took a chance and just showed up. Luckily, we came at a good time and only had about a 5-10 minute wait.   First off, I have to applaud the service here. The server and the wait staff are excellent. They are so enthusiastic, helpful, honest, and provided some of the most warming service I've ever received. It wasn't phony or stagnant; it's so transparent here that the people love what they do! I have to give props to the chef as well; the menu is eclectic, interesting, varied, but comfortable and delicious!   When asked for recommendations between the salmon skillet and the Kentucky Fried Chicken, our waitress quickly said to get the chicken, hands down. I love when the staff has an opinion on the food-- it helps out so much!  I ordered a coffee, which was bold and delicious! The dish came out pretty fast; it was beautiful; so colorful and it smelled amazing. The chicken is not for the faint of heart; it's heavy and hearty without being super greasy. Hash mash, fried chicken, country gravy, over-easy eggs; crazy combination, but it works out beautifully. Food was cooked to perfection (over-easy eggs were done RIGHT!) and everything was really tasty. We left stuffed and happy!   I'll definitely be back when in town-- thanks for a great experience!",

    "text": "MTO Cafe just opened at 1:00pm on Oct. 22nd so the timing of the 1st three reviews are a little suspicious. The cafe is on the smaller side, but well designed and welcoming. I ordered the Skuna Bay Salmon wrap, which was not what I expected. The wrap had eggs in it, which were not listed in the description, and I do not like salmon and eggs cooked together. I was expecting something more like a wrap version of lox and bagels. Aside from that fact, I think other people would like this combination. For a $12 wrap, I would have expected it to include chips or fries, but it didn't so I also ordered a side of fries... which where unseasoned and \"floppy\".   Overall, it's nice to have another dining option downtown, but I think MTO Cafe is a little on the pricey side for breakfast and lunch offerings. It will be interesting to see how they do over time.",

It is 75 cents per half hour tho but that's given when you're in the downtown area.   The ambiance is pretty neat. The glass windows allow the restaurant to be brightened up.   They have $15 all you can drink mimosas. If I wasn't already hung over when I went here I would of taken advantage of that but instead I just got a water with lemon lol.   I got a chicken skillet which I thought was pretty good. It had chicken sausage, eggs, potatoes, spinach & red peppers. It was the perfect amount to eat. Nieves D. got the Chicken in a waffle Which I thought was a cool idea. She did mention that the chicken lacked seasoning and flavor. But the fries that came with it was pretty good. They were nice and thin and crispy.  I thought the food was good but if I was in the downtown area I'd prolly rush to Eat. for breakfast instead of coming here again.",

I ordered the vegan falafel and it was really good it definitely filled me up the only thing I didn't like was the it came with a side of greens I love greens but the wrap itself had greens already a different side would have been nicer. I would have ordered another side but the menus wasn't too detailed. They have alcoholic beverages bottomless mimosas for $20. Our server was very nice, she was attentive. I definitely would go again but they do not have too many vegan options only 2.",

Searched for 'organic breakfast' (as per friend's request) and this popped up first, so we plugged it into Google maps and headed over. Parked in the garage nearby, and walked in. Grabbed some coffee (comes in a bowl ,lol) and ordered the Bodybuilder omelet and fresh fruit. Enjoyed sipping a great coffee while my breakfast was brought out quickly. Our waiter was attentive, and when we were preparing to checkout the place started getting busy  (Perhaps the reason the request for a free cookie as per Yelp check-in was looked over- no biggie.) Got $1.50 off parking in the garage which was neat.  Overall not a bad place, would be a good idea to stop by to break that fast. ;-)",

We were greeted quickly and given the chance to peruse the menus as our drink orders were taken. I was drawn to many of the menu items that were available, so it took a while to figure out what to order. My mom and I opted to share the Kentucky Fried chicken and eggs (gravy on the side) and grilled cheese with brie and honey with walnuts.   The chicken was great. Lightly battered and not oily. I'm glad she chose to have the gravy served on the side since neither of us cared for it. It was a little too sweet for our taste we skipped it altogether. The hashed browns were great and the eggs were cooked well. I enjoyed the grilled cheese quite a bit. I had hoped for more crunch or char on the bread, but overall the tastes were all very complementary. A little more crunch to the bread would definitely have take this dish to the next level for me.   Service was great and the vibe was just right. I didn't love the parking situation, but since most people who dine here likely work in the area and walk here, I don't see that being an issue for most.",

It's a shame it's not open until dinner.   I had the turkey club sandwich which was very good. Fries were above average as well. The next time I went I had their steak and eggs. The steak was cooked as desired and it was marinated in garlic and other herbs. He eggs were also cooked as desired (a perfect medium, most places can't seem to figure that one out).

We asked for a different glass and it took well over 30 minutes to get to our table but only after we asked again.   2. Took forever to order. Took forever to get our food. Took forever to get our checks. We were there for over 90 minutes.   3. My burger was supposed to be medium rare and it came out well done. Very well done.   4. A lot of stuff we asked for never made it to our table but it absolutely made our checks. Meaning the cooks and our waitress missed it. Definitely not a good thing.   5. Our server was nice but extremely slow. On top of being super slow they were also taking food orders. There were only 6 tables and 3 people on the floor.   Reason I'm torn is because most of our food was great. The rest was ok. Missing bacon, over cooked, wrong order, etc... This place has good potential and is walking distance from the office. I'm going to give it one more chance since there is so much rave about this place.",

They have a lot of things with bacon although I do not eat bacon (since 1991)...what I ordered did not come with bacon but my order had bacon in it... They took it back and told me I would have to wait 20 minutes for a \"wrap\", seriously?? No thanks...  Instantly I bad 1st experience!",

Me and my girlfriend were down visiting from Los Angeles and we luckily found this place last minute for their bottomless mimosas. Lisa didn't let our cups become empty, and Chris and Brandon both were consistently checking up on us as well as the other patrons in the restaurant. The vibe is at home and chill. The atmosphere is relaxing and the staff makes you feel like you're a regular customer although this was our first time. I give 5 stars and will most definitely return the next time I'm in town.

The cute waitresses were very accommodating (service great!).  I had the turkey melt, while my partner had a California sandwich. Both SO good. Fries: excellent.  The people next to us had the BLTAE (with avocado and egg), and the egg tacos. Both looked as good as they said they were. Therefore, I have to go back! Food this good doesn't deserve to be hidden. I'll probably be checking out the Summerlin location (closer to home), but with my many visits to the Arts District, this Downtown Gem won't be losing my business. Fantastic!",

Prices and wait weren't too bad, but then again I went by myself so it's a little bit easier to find a space.  I had ordered the Kentucky Fried Chicken, the mac n cheese, and a bloody mary. The bloody mary was decent, if you want it spicy ask for it for sure and they'll adjust. The mac n cheese was tasty though a bit runny. The crackers on top are just crumbled ritz crackers and add a salt factor to the dish. I wanted more from the mac n cheese though, it wasn't as hearty as I would like. The KFC was the noms though. The chicken was cooked well but lost it's crispness to being covered by the egg as well as the gravy. Wanted a bit more of the mash browns to provide a nice starch blanket at the bottom. I wish I had added bacon in retrospect but I think that's cuz I wanted more of a salt factor from the gravy itself, and more gravy also. Keep in mind this is a heavy dish though so if you have a nap in mind, this would be perfect to set things up.  I'd stop by again if I was in the area, more to try some of their vegetarian options. My road to recovery that day needed the giant meal and the nap. If you have a large group though, plan ahead, send someone first. Seating can be pretty limited.",

Say at the bar and got served straight away.  No grapefruit juice but they do have Blueberry ginger lemonade. Boom  start with that. Delicious. Next I checked in to grab a cookie on Yelp. It's coming at the end of the meal. Heated.   And then the Huevos Rancheros came. Now I'm not going to bore you with a flowery description,so simply put they were amazing. 9/10 I would do it again. That other one time would be the pancakes I saw go by with full strips of bacon cooked right in. I'm going for that one next time.  Soon as I mopped up the skillet with my wheat bread toast, buttered and delicious. Without even asking my warm chocolate chip cookie appeared before me. Needless to say I ended up slamming that down and all its deliciousness. Restaurant was great. David super friendly staff. I made the whole experience better and just the food.  Bathrooms are also super clean. Yay for clean bathrooms.",

Not sure if the lady really knows how to make one, she keeps gradually adding more and more OJ like she's not sure what color it should be to stop.  My mom seemed to like her philly cheese steak.

ATMOSPHERE Parked conveniently on the street in a designated meter area. I know there is a parking garage located behind the restaurant too. Walking into MTO Cafe, it is lit during the day with the natural light streaming from the floor-to-ceiling windows. Very busy, but the service and wait time was quick and friendly. The space inside is very modern chic and relaxing. Perfect for our brunch. Also, my sister LOVED the fact that her phone was dying and they had an outlet literally on the wall at our table, eye-level.  FOOD I ordered the MTO Avocado Omelet. Portion size was fine, I wasn't starving, so the meal was great for me. Lots of avocado, and served with a tiny salad and a few fresh fruits. I also ordered the Green Juice, very very yummy! I loved how many fruits and vegetables were in there, and you could definitely taste the freshness.  SERVICE Water was always refilled, friendly service but kind of absent most of the time. We wanted hot sauce, but couldn't be attended til 15 minutes after we got our food. Place was busy, so understandable. I couldn't finish my juice and took it to go. They promptly gave me a to go cup for it.  Overall, relaxing and good experience, but not incredible. I feel like I could have cooked the omelet at home, but the green juice and atmosphere was great. It's a place to go to enjoy fun conversation, light food and the hippie-chic feel of Downtown Las Vegas' booming food culture.",

Well that's what I would imagine eating one of those babies would feel like... just utter bliss. It comes with string fries which I'm not a fan of whatsoever. I'll have to ask if they have wedges or some other sort of side.    The only blip in the experience was the chocolate chip cookie. It was the hard crunchy type but in the pics they looked chewy... guess which one I prefer? Lol.  BUT, they do validate parking so, meh.

    "text": "This was such as awesome find! Sometimes you just get tired of Hash House when in Vegas and crave something fresh and new! This was definitely fresh and new, at least for us! And, OMG this place has vegan pancakes!!! I don't think I've had any pancakes at any restaurant since I went off of dairy 10 years ago, so this was so exciting for me! and they were GOOD!  In fact, everyone in our group was happy with their meals. It was a lot like Hash House, but with many healthier options. But there are still indulgent options for those whose diets were left at home. The portions are definitely comparable to Hash! Non of us could finish, I would probably share my plate the next time we go.    The location is great too, just a little bit North of the strip. It's worth it to venture off for a good meal!",

Server was great didn't catch her name.  Good coffee.  Started with the apple rings and they were fantastic!  Took a while to get our breakfasts even though they were not busy.  My wife got the broccoli skillet and added Chorizo (not on the menu) per our servers suggestion and it was really good!  They goofed up my Chorizo skillet and I had to wait another 10 minute while my wife ate :-(.  They were apologetic and very nice about it, stuff happens not a big deal.  When I got mine it was not as good as my wifes I think if they added cheese to this dish it would do the trick and make it much better.  Met Mike the GM, good guy and he comped us the Apple rings for the mess up on my order that was very cool.  They weren't perfect and overall a little slow so thats why the 4 stars but I am a fan and will definitely be back and hope to upgrade to 5 stars on my next visit.",

The servers were extremely friendly and even took the time to entertain us and joke around. Overall an amazing time spent here at MTO cafe. Oh I was also offered a commentary powdered sugar donut since the yelp check in item was unavailable at the time. Upgraded from a cookie to a doughnut, perfect!! Haha",

To be honest, I don't think I've tried anything else and I've eaten here many times. And I'm not a big french fry person, but I love theirs.   Employees are always welcoming and on it! Very friendly, outgoing staff despite how busy it may be at lunch time. Atmosphere was spot on for me.  Great location downtown because it's connected to the City Hall parking garage and they'll validate part of your parking fee.   I've taken several friends to lunch here, all of them enjoying what they've ordered. I believe they'd all be repeat customers as well.",

Mid you check out the restrooms the ladies' door is labeled 'eggs' while the men's are 'sausages' haha. Also, don't forget to check in to get free chocolate chip cookies and they also validate your parking ticket. Score!  I ordered the lemon poppy seed pancake with blueberry ginger compote. My bf ordered the onion soup and chorizo skillet and out friend ordered the hangover burger.   I had three huge pancakes! They were really good but I wish it came with more of the blueberry ginger compote, I barely tasted the ginger as well! It was still delicious though and I'm glad they gave syrup on the side. I tasted my bf's chorizo skillet and I loved the blend of the chorizo, egg, tomato and potato! Very hearty meal. He also enjoyed his French onion soup. I think he even liked it more than his skillet haha.   Overall, great place to have breakfast/brunch/lunch. Decently price and you don't have to wait in line like in the buffets.",

While it's not super close to Fremont St, it's worth the 10-minute walk. The food is fresh, delicious, and the service is wonderful. Hearty portions and very flavorful food made us very happy to find something that wasn't in a casino or a chain restaurant. While all I had were basic eggs over easy, the buttered sourdough was mouth-watering. Pancake was just okay to be honest, but my hubby had the daily special (double sausage, double egg and cheese) and he was very happy!",

I redeemed my Yelp Check -In Offer for a free warm chocolate chip cookie (that hubby ate-evil carbs!) and he, who is ridiculously picky about his chocolate chip cookies, LOVED it. He ate it slowly so he could savor it.  :)  Let's not forget the service. The staff here is so chill, so laid back, yet 100% on their game! Smiles, friendly attitudes, we loved it.

    "text": "THE GOOD:  -Walkable distance from most of the main downtown hotel casinos & just a block away from Bonneville Transit Center if you want to bus it from The Strip.   -Interesting menu variety that has something for everyone. So much so that it makes you want to try everything on the menu.  -Was not crowded on a weekday which was when I visited. Very odd for a place with such high review marks.  -Server was very courteous and friendly.  THE BAD:  -While walkable if coming from the direction of The Plaza Hotel along Main Street, the neighborhood is very sketchy and does not feel safe even in broad daylight. And from what I can tell while riding on the SDX, even the walk from Bonneville Transit Center looks hazardous to pedestrians so you may have to walk a very long walk to avoid getting hit by cars.  -I had the misfortunate experience of an apparent lost order where it was not \"relayed\" to the kitchen which could mean any number of things. Waiting 35 minutes for your meal to arrive can do a number of things to your imagination. Who screwed up? It sure sounded like the server blamed it on their computer system. What the heck does \"relayed\" mean? Does it mean it got punched into the system and the send button wasn't hit? Whatever.   -The manager came by to apologize for the wait. Even asked me if there was something he can do for me. I'm not one to ask for anything complimentary so what can I do but shrug? Not a single piece of appeasement or discount was had or offered to make up for it so it made his apology sound insincere. Why are you asking me how to do your job? It only made me more angry and upset.  THE UGLY:  -In an attempt to bring everything out at once as suggested by my server, and to add insult to injury, my grilled cheese sandwich was cold. No ways would I wait another 30 minutes for them to make a new one. In hindsight I should have asked them to remove it from my bill.  -An overall horribly disappointing experience. But don't let my obvious fluke and lapse in service stop you from trying this place out. I even posted pictures since it seems apparent every other reviewer loves this place. I'm just not one of them.",

I always have a bowl of fresh fruit, salad, and the Avocado which has amazing flavors nothing is too overpowering. Their bottomless mimosa is always a must for weekend  brunch. Love this place!

The food is delicious, as attested by so many Yelpers, but what makes this place so wonderful is what it brings to our local neighborhood, economy, and community.

They opened up downtown only two months ago and I've already eaten there (or from there) like 8 times. And if you know me, that's pretty impressive.   First off let me talk about the food, it takes center stage. The hangover burger is ridiculous. Angus beef, Tillamook cheddar, fried egg and their house slaw IS OUT OF THIS WORLD. I rarely go back for seconds on burgers, this one i cant get enough of. Also their Caesar salads are just the right amount of garlic (for peeps that like that sort of thing, which i do) and caressed by flaky tender croutons. The breakfast is also amazing. Try their MTO special, 4 kinds of meats, eggs and this amazing mash browns (WHAT...) It's bananas. I never knew how good SPAM was till now.   Guys, check this place out. It's ridiculous good, I for one am going back to try everything on the menu at least once.   The staff is super friendly and attentive, and the ambiance is hip and inviting. Truly a great find on my part (good job Dre, your welcome bro). ALSO, 15$ bottomless mimosas or bloody mary's...cant beat that.   Trust me guys, check this place out, your stomach will be thankful.",

The staff is really nice and the place is clean. On a weekday.. Parking is horrible but its worth the little walk for the large amount of food you receive. I will be returning ! .. Come on bottomless mimosas with several types of flavors.",

I ordered the breakfast burger which was delicious! It was topped with a perfectly oozy egg & came with yummy shoestring fries. My person got the Kentucky fried chicken, which I \"tried\" more than 4 or 5 bites of. My friend enjoyed her Reuben sandwich very much so.  The woman who sat us was sweet and the gentleman who validated our parking was very nice.  Unfortunately the experience was dampened when the brown haired gentleman gave us our check while several people were still eating, which was odd seeing that there was no line and we did not ask for the check. We felt rushed to leave and did so when the drinks were finished.",

This place just needed to have an open patio, people with small dogs and a beach breeze and you would believe you were in a cafe in Cali. Had the avocado skillet style and avocado toast with tomatoes. The hash browns or brown mash were so damn tasty! They felt like a warm hug on a Sunday afternoon! Great spot!",

Arrived around 10am on a Sunday and it was a full house- music setting a great tempo- the chattering and energy set for an awesome vibe- We were seated near a window which made for a great view! They have usb chargers along the wall/bench seating area and multiple people were on charge while engaging in their MTO experience. The cafe is clean and the kitchen is open for all eyes to see which always makes us yelpers excited:) The waitress Lisa was warm- with very neat appearance and took great care of her patrons. She was quick and attentive and seems to really enjoy her job- she interacted well with guests as she cracked jokes and shared in light conversation while serving. When the food arrived it was nothing my morning didn't need. I loved the avocado toast with tomatoes it was creamy and thick with fresh avocado spread. I added a splash off cholula to the top and all I can say is OMG! Something so simple yet so tasty-  My girlfriend got the avocado skillet it did not disappoint/ We like to share for the variety factor. There is something very downhome about the brown mash and the way the crisp of the potato ties in the texture of the dish. My mouth a day later is craving more MTO- a lady next to me was eating the veggie hash skillet and as odd as it sounds I was completely admiring her as I watched her eat what also looked to be yumlicious so It's plain to say I'm gonna become a regular at MTO- There was nothing I would change and I'd highly recommend visiting this downtown eatery! Oh and they love yelpers too! I checked in and was gifted a chocolate chip cookie- 5 stars really isn't enough for MTO!",

Off of recommendations me and my home girl ordered the fat Elvis French toast and the kfc. The kfc was nice and flavorful. Everything went well together I give it 8/10. The chicken was also juicy as well not dry not salty either. The French toast tho was bomb!! I love bacon peanut butter Nutella banana and strawberries. Everything tasted amazing together I gave that a 10/10. I would definitely come back. And if you park in the parking structure make sure you validate with them!",

    "text": "The food was great here. The experience, not so much. I arrived with my group of 4 on a Saturday morning at 9am and it was not busy, with only 2 other small parties there. We got seated right away.  We ordered the stuffed cinnamon apple french toast, red velvet pancakes, and steak & eggs. We also checked in on Yelp for the chocolate chip cookie. The cookie was a nice touch, thin and full of chocolate chips. After the cookie arrived, many people started trickling in and the restaurant became full. We waited 30 minutes for our food. That's really long, considering there were only 2 other parties there when we arrived. The good part is that the food is probably more fresh and made to order, unlike some other restaurants.  The steak & eggs was filling and cooked very good. The red velvet pancakes were very indulgent and filling. The french toast was truly filled with cinnamon apples! We devoured everything. At the end when we paid our bill, the waiter brought us the parking validation card.  Parking: We parked in the adjacent parking structure. On Saturdays & Sundays, parking is $3 flat rate. I got a validation card from MTO. Upon leaving the parking structure, we had to insert our parking card first and then the validation card from MTO after. The validation subtracted $1.50, so we still had to pay $1.50. So much for a validation. It's only a partial validation. I could have parked along the streets.",

Here's what was served according to stations:  (1) chicken skewers, beef skewers, octopus, pickled vegetables  (2) mini burgers, salmon veggie tart, pumpkin soups in mini pumpkins (3) dessert station: a.) freshly made mini ice cream cones- chocolate & strawberry balsamic b.) mini cake cube platters  Here's what was served, via models carrying platters: (1) mini beef wellington (2) chicken pot-pie  (3) hummus & kale wraps (like sushi)  Everything was delicious and amazing. The presentation was great, too. There was definitely enough to go around---I really do not think there were any complaints about the food. My favorite stand-outs were both of the skewers, mini burgers, mini beef wellington, and the mini ice cream cones too.   KUDOS to all the chefs, staff, and everyone (owners) from the restaurant. Everyone was nice, professional, and very involved in the entire process. It's a good sign when everyone talks about how delicious the food was, the very next day.",

I had a BLTA with egg last time I was here and was so pleased. There's just something about a runny yolk all over my food. So velvety and sinful. Their bacon pancake strips are also bomb.

Got the KFC breakfast due to the reviews here and I'll be honest I probably wouldn't order it again. It wasn't bad but it wasn't delicious either. The chicken and gravy had a subtle sweet smokiness to it that I was not  expecting. Also I am sensitive to overly salted food but  I think this dish could have used MORE salt... But, nothing a few splashes of Cholula and sprinkle of salt couldn't fix.  Husband got the MTO breakfast which was your typical breakfast fare, eggs, your choice of toast (brioche!) and a plethora of breakfast meats. It was good and filling.  Would definitely come back to try other things.",

    "text": "Went here yesterday for lunch. Pretty busy little place at lunch time with the downtown business crowd.  Anyhow, there food is solid but overpriced. Nothing exceptional but nothing bad that I have had either. I had the salmon burger yesterday. The shoestring french fries were good, I am pretty sure they are fresh and that was probably my favorite part.  The salmon burger itself, which was recommended by the waitress, was extremely dry. I was hesitant to try it as they stated it was not a piece of salmon . I surmised it was salmon flakes with filler aka what I would expect from the frozen section at any grocery store. So going back to the dry salmon patty, the salmon burger had cream cheese - which again I am not a big fan of but I think the cream cheese and the copious amounts of mayonnaise helped offset the dryness of the salmon patty.  The menu stated that the salmon burger had a balsamic aioli, however I could not taste that at all on the burger and there did not appear to be any balsamic dressing on the burger.  I did like the bread and butter chips on top of the burger (there were five held on top with a toothpick).  My total for the salmon burger & fries, with no drink including a $2 tip was $15. I just don't see going back for the price that they charge.   I overhead another waiter saying that the hangover burger was great, and my friend who got the hangover burger liked it but I just can't justify paying $13 for a burger unless I was at BURGR or the like.  If I am going to get a hamburger and it's not high end then I am an In-N-Out girl because, hey, that's what a hamburger's all about... but I digress.   I went to MTO once before, about six months ago, and remember getting the salmon wrap. Again I remember it being okay but nothing really noteworthy. I split it with a friend and it is definitely not big enough for splitting.   As a side note, they serve beer for $5, there were some good choices Dogfish Head 60 - although they also had PBR, I question who would really pay $5 for PBR - although a friend pointed out he noted a resurgence of \"cheap\" beer as being trendy - I haven't noticed that but I pay more attention to micro brews and wine myself.  But MTO seems to attempt to appeal to a sense of nostalgia by referencing wonder bread and Velveeta amongst other items, so maybe that is their justification for $5 for PBR? Anyway, long story short - okay to try but don't get the salmon burger unless you are in the mood for a patty that has the moisture of the Sahara desert and expect to pay a premium for pretty much anything.",

I am really kinda on the fence with what we had, perhaps one more try for the lunch menu as it contains some interesting SOUNDING at least sandwiches that would peak my interest. Do the prices match the food. Ehhh perhaps for a hipster just not that family vibe more of a college young entrepenour type of place.......i do like that it offers the free wifi, but that should be expected....ambiance, cleanliness, service ,and something about the table flatware rate it a hard 3.75 the food did not elevate it above that but cannot do a 3.75.

I had the mto breakfast and it was so bland. My mom got the avocado wrap the wrap was just ok. My cousin was told she couldnt order chicken tenders and fries because she wasnt a kid. So she was forced to order pancakes. Pancakes were bland and dry. My niece ordered French toast that were too soggy to enjoy. Lastly my sister ordered vegan pancakes she didn't even finish them. I am really baffled with all of these good reviews. Did everyone at the table just happen to order the wrong thing!? We would have been happier going to Ihop. The bill was around 80$  WTF not worth it at all.",

I recommend the hangover burger and the KFC breakfast. The coffee is also great. My brother ordered the fat Elvis French toast and was severely disappointed. Nobody mentioned specials or dessert: two things I would have liked to been informed about. The place was clean but the service demands that two stars be taken.",

It's a small space but it's so modern and elements of different cities is all around. Our server was really friendly and attentive throughout and I noticed the owners were there talking with everyone, I loved that! I ordered the chicken \"in a waffle\", it was sooo good! Super tender crispy fried chicken sandwiched between fluffy waffles and then gravy alll over! I added syrup to it, wasn't served with any and def put syrup on it. Great portions and a bonus, they serve it with fries. Made my Sunday! Coffee was great too :)",

When she came back to take our order she told us they weren't making huevos rancheros. Strike two, really. She was perfectly nice an apologetic, but we decided to move on. We paid for the juice, tipped her, and headed further down Main to Makers and Finders - which is simply amazing. I'll leave it at that...",

After watching everyone around us come and go and waiting another 10 - 15 minutes we finally decided to just leave. We walked past our waitress on the way out and she said nothing.

    "text": "I'm pretty disappointed by this place, today... I ordered a vegan falafel wrap, some French fries and a chocolate chip cookie. The falafel wrap was bland and the pieces of falafel were about the size of my thumb, so most of the time, I was chomping on leafy greens and a wrap. I mean, the tahini sauce would've made it more enjoyable, but there was probably about 1tbsp on the entire wrap. The French fries were so crispy, I couldn't finish them. The cookie was definitely under-baked. I've eaten at this cafe twice before, and my experiences were OK, but today was terrible. To add, I placed my order at 9:19am this morning, and didn't receive my order till 10:32am. This place is a 6 minute walk from my place of work, but with a thirty minute lunch break (15 of which are spent pumping breastmilk for my son), I didn't wanna waste 12 minutes walking. I called the cafe twice to get an ETA. The first time I was told, \"It'll be there any minute,\" and then I was hung up on. The second time, I was starting to get impatient, and was told that the delivery guy had four more orders to deliver. I asked if my food would be cold, and was reassured it wouldn't...well that was a lie. I was told they have a 3mi. radius on deliveries... It takes about 8 minutes to drive 3 miles going 25mph...so again, I'm not sure why my delivery took AN HOUR. I paid $20 on food that was COLD and I didn't even enjoy, which really bums me out. Trust me, I get it. $20 is no big deal for a company, but geez, at least act like you care about your customers.",

The customer service was so inviting! Kelly Schaudel had very good customer service as well as Trevor! I plan I going back many many times! Great addition to Downtown Summerlin!!!!!",

However, I am sure it would be more than welcome. Kid menu, check. In fact, it's super cute! While most parents pull out the iPhone or iPad during a meal, MTO Cafe offers up a fresh alternative - an etch-a-sketch, love it! Kid-friendly, check. Not only is the menu important, but so is the atmosphere. Overall family approval, five stars.  Not only is it kid-friendly, but I will most certainly check-in and hook up in between downtown meetings. With individual charging stations at each booth, free Wifi and a fun, inspiring ambiance you will find me here, hooked up on a regular basis.  Parking and location is a breeze, located just below a public parking garage so it couldn't get much easier. I am sure that the landscape will change during the week - business people and those looking for a to-go option.  One thing I LOVE - the outdoor dining, one thing that Vegas is missing. For this alone, I will return. The food was AMAZING! Honestly, I am not a huge comfort food gal so I went with the avocado omelet and am so glad that I did. However, I found myself devouring the mash potato, stuffed hash browns... a must! Chef has perfected the french onion soup according to my husband (he was french trained we later learned, so why not give it a try). The littles appreciated the smiley face ketchup that accompanied the grilled cheese and baby boy loved the vegan coconut, carrot pancake - even though he can't talk, I'm pretty sure that lack of anything left is a sure sign.  With the restaurant just opening there were a couple things not available so we will be sure to visit in the coming weeks to give those a try as well. Until then...",

This place happens to be right in the middle of my office and my lunch buddy so we meet here often.  The cafe has a clean and refreshing atmosphere, service is excellent but food is overall \"good\" with a few glimmers of YUM.    I always read the menu and order with great expectations but more often than not, my taste buds are left underwhelmed.  It's basically healthy comfort food but maybe that''s my whole internal conflict. Anyhow, let''s get to the grub.  Here's a run-down of what I've tried with a *STAR* rating 1-5:  --Coffee  **** --Green juice *** --Avocado omelet ** --Fries** --Philly steak sandwich *** --Tomato soup with cheese toast  **** --Caesar salad with chicken *** -- Fried chicken w/gravy, eggs and smashbrowns *****  (best thing there!) --MTO Breakfast **",

The parking garage was a plus, it was only $3 when we went, and the waitress did validate it for $1.50 off, another bonus.   We had a group of 5, one being vegan, and she found plenty of items to order. I ended up splitting the Fat Elvis and the Fried Chicken & Waffles, I wasn't really into the Fat Elvis, but the Chicken & Waffles were fantastic, not the best I've had, but they were tasty. We also tried the donuts and fried apple rings. Both were good, not something I would order again.  There were a few other menu items I'd like to come back and try, the Quinoa Burger looks great. I'll be back when I find myself in need of a breakfast spot downtown, this is way better than eat.",

Parking is in a structure and would cost money, BE SURE TO GET A VOUCHER! It's great. The food was as expected and of good quality.   To put it in perspective, I felt like I had been hit by a train from the night before and was willing to really eat anything. But, I was willing to eat at MTO cafe. I got the scramble and it was nice and substantial. Decently priced and you get what you ask for. The staff was quite friendly and patient to our slow thought process on the day.

    "text": "Best breakfast/brunch in Las Vegas. Now that Pura Vida is closed for good...I rank this place my new fav brunch spot.   Why? Quality.  Farmers market local veggies and homemade everything. Attention to detail and custom orders are no problem. My kind of restaurant!  We were running errands or we would have biked from our place Downtown. Easy location to get to. It's near The Plaza parking lot on in the bottom of the City Parking Building. City electric cars and car chargers line the bottom of the garage and the parking is only $3 on the weekends.   I drink my coffee black. They serve LavAzza coffee and have raw sugar option on the tables. Two wins in my book.  I must confess I do not like breakfast and being vegan on top of that there are hardly ever options in brunch type places...not MTO. The vegan items are clearly marked on the menu.  On our first visit we ordered half our meal a la carte. Sauteed fresh mushrooms, tomatoes, avocado and hash browns minus the mash (I think the mash browns have cream). Tossed all together it was a huge portion that hubby happily devoured.   We also ordered the carrot coconut vegan pancakes. Like I said I don't like breakfast and can't stand the smell of syrup of anything remotely close to honey. For some reason the pancakes were the one of the best things I have ever eaten. Ever. They were warm, fluffy, sweet and soft in places from agave nectar. Wow. They have changed my life forever :)  I ordered the vegan falafel wrap. Yum! It has a dressing of which I guessed it to be a citrus and tahini base. Stephanie of VegOut makes a similar dressing on her massaged kale salad and it's also similar to WILD's kale salad dressing. Inside this huge portion wrap are long pieces of falafel. It's not traditional like my inlaws make, it's more of a creamy mash mixture that I want to guess it baked instead of fried. It's very good. Also inside is romaine and greens, red onion, cucumber, and roasted tomatoes. I subbed the side salad for hash browns minus the mash again (no possible cream).    Amazing.  We got there at open at 8am on a Saturday and it was not busy. But I imagine that weekdays are packed with the City Building being across the street.   Belly full of fresh goodness we were very pleased with our meal and will def be back to the little Downtown spot!",

Prices are comparable in the $8-15 range with any other spot in town.  MTO is a little further into downtown than your usual Fremont spots, which means it will probably have less of a wait during primetime hours, but there will still be a wait unless you come after noon.  And beware of the staff here.  They are very slow and it takes a while to get seated, but still a nice meal nonetheless.",

    "text": "There were several good options for breakfast when I checked Yelp for our visit to Vegas (we were staying off the main strip that morning). We decided on this one as it had good reviews and was closest to where we were at.   We were quite disappointed. I feel like they were trying to be too creative and forgot some of the basics. I'm from the Bay Area and have been to plenty of trendy restaurants similar to this, but thought this fell flat. My wife got the Fat Elvis (bananas, nutella, and peanut butter stuffed between two large slices of french toast with strawberries on the side) and I got the chicken and waffles. We basically split the two plates to try them both.   I like sweet breakfast foods, but the flavors of the Fat Elvis just didn't work for either of us. It may have been the combination of the nutella with peanut butter. Aside from that, the actual french toast was pretty lackluster. The waffle part of the chicken and waffles was bland--I can make much better waffles at home. The chicken was fine, but the sauce they used on top of the chicken wasn't that great. I've only had chicken and waffles one other time, and it was amazing there, so maybe the bar was set to high for me. The fries that came with the chicken and waffles were pretty good.   We came in at an odd hour (about 10:40am), so we were the only ones there part of the time. The service was very friendly. But the two meals we got were ones recommended by the waitress, and we just were not fans of them.  For the price (our meals were $13 each), I would have hoped for a lot better.",

Quick overnight in Vegas and we decided to get out for food before hitting the road to Denver.   We weren't disappointed! I had the chicken sausage skillet and it was fresh, tasty and quite huge. He had waffles with fresh fruit and that was also excellent. I think overall the food and service is definitely worth of 4 stars but that 5th star.... That is thanks to USB charging ports above each booth because they even care to feed our devices.   Also, because of the Banksy-style art all over the walls. Awesome.   Definitely worth the stop in.",

My side of market vegetables had no spinach this time, just chopped broccoli and tomatoes but still very fresh and tasty. The cost of a soy latte ($3) is so refreshing, coming from the Bay Area.",

Also lucky for me most everything served at MTO hits the spot, is tasty, and has been brought to me with good service.  The cafe itself I enjoy most when there are only a few patrons and their music is not up too loud. I have been here a couple times and Ive been annoyed with the volume.  Coffee here is a never fail. Period. Big cups. Good coffee. Plenty of refills.  On my last visit I tried the lemon poppy seed pancakes with blueberry conpote with a side of chicken sausage. Chicken sausage is stellar. Always good, with a medely of slightly sweet spices and juicy with a slight snap. Have on the side. Have mixed in an omelet. Just have it.  Pancakes were \"eh\". The flavor was not enough for me to appreciate them being a \"lemon\" pancake. Blueberry compote, while rich and thick was disappointing because it offered no sugar/sweet flavor to the dish. So all in all these pancakes were bland with a tart sauce on top of them. Pass.  Still holding at 4 stars. I will be back for more!",

When I walked in the server said they have free parking offering the validation ticket to the next parking lot which you could use following by your parking ticket when leaving. And when I was about to leave the cafe I asked again should I went to the paying machine or directly to exit, and the answer is directly to exit by one female manger biteing chewing gum.  But when the time I was leaving I still have to pay another $1.5 by credit card (international transaction) besides the validation ticket offering. And you have no chice but paying on the spot cause you were stuck there with a line behind you.   The $1.5 was not big deal but the experience was really bad with incomplete information so I went back to ask the reason why and got 3 different explanation...  First one is I have to go to payment machines first then to exit by another server. Second answer by the prevuious server was they only provide 1hr validation card and he was sorry for that, which I believe is True however I was not told.   The last one answer got from female manager (accompanied asides during the conversation) was it was written on top of the card and they ALWAYS explain that, which I strongly believed I didn't catch any part of that during the 1.5hr brunch time, and she insisted they always do while keep chewing her gum...   Anyway, nice food and all the outlook. But the whole experience was really bad been given misleading information and not friendly AT ALL (the manager) replying while providing feedback....",

We ordered coffee, which came in HUGE mugs (my favorite) and we were able to get soy milk on the side, because we are dairy free. My husband got the MTO breakfast which had eggs, a bevy of meats, hash browns and toast. I had the veggie skillet (OMG SO GOOD) and a vegan pancake with coconut and carrots which was insane. Ryan checked back in on us several times, was a delight to talk to, had many insights about the local area, and knew everything on the menu. He seemed genuinely invested in whether or not we were liking our food, as did the several other people who checked on us while we were there. It was such a fantastic experience and so delicious that we had to eat there again on our last day. And again, it was perfect. So... GO THERE! EAT! ENJOY! And tell Ryan we say hi!",

My uncle had the chicken in between two waffles, which he enjoyed immensely.  The Bloody Marys had a bit of orange and ginger to lighten it up a bit; very good addition.  Staff were happy and friendly and took time to explain what they do and even allowed us to sample things they were preparing for later, like a caramel apple sangria.  It's not cheap, but not too expensive.  If you want to have a great breakfast and enjoy your morning slowly, this is the place to be.",

The chocolate chip cookies are the perfect texture between crisp and chewy, the macaroni and cheese will change your life, and the juices they come up with are awesome. I've been there for a watermelon limeade concoction (my favorite so far) and they gave me a freebie on their pineapple mint today while I waited. Staff was apologetic and friendly and they always do their best to make it better when you're held up. It's a great place to just hang out.

Sure, at first I didn't know if it was a good idea leaving the downtown street when a homeless gentleman starting calling me and my girl \"pieces of s&%#, Mother F$#@$%S\" and another gent was seemingly trying to do something vulgar with a traffic cone.   When we reached the point where the girlfriend was going to start the \"you never listen, ask for directions\" BS, we found it.    Most of the places in Vegas are dark and smokey but when you first go into MTO Cafe, it is open and sunny.  The staff was friendly and service top notch.  The food was delicious and tasted great.  My lady had the berry waffles and I had the Fat Elvis, French toast with peanut butter, nuttela, bananas and a scattering of strawberries, it was awesome!

It's always nice when a new restaurant feels like it could be from almost any urban city. I must say, it feels much nicer in person than the photos suggest. Mainly because of the 14 foot ceilings and the floor to ceiling windows that look out onto the new City Hall. This is a breakfast to lunch place so they close at 2:00 PM on weekdays. We arrived at 1:00 PM on a Tuesday and completely missed the crowds. We were promptly greeted, seated and had out drink orders taken by the enthusiastic waitstaff. Tried to order the Chocolate Chip Cookies with Whole Milk and the Strawberry Cheese Cake, but they had sold out. We did split the Ruben and an order of the Honey Donuts. They were both great. Another pleasant surprise, they serve decent coffee! Personally I would prefer a cup of their coffee over a Starbucks, if only for a change. I am a fan. We will return to try out some other the other menu items that looked good.",

We were seated within 5 minutes so that was good. I ordered the salmon over hash with 2 eggs sunny side up. I was expecting a good amount of salmon but it was just 1 slice of lox. The meal was still yummy, tomatoes were amazingly seasoned. I had to order a side of bacon because the hash seemed Bare without any meat and that one piece of salmon. My boyfriend had the hangover burger and loved it! They offer an all you can drink option of mimosa and I think it was beer? Which is awesome. We didn't get it this time , maybe next time. Ambience is great, very modern. The staff was good too, very attentive, I think the manager also came to check on us and was helping the staff with serving food which is really nice to see. They offer healthy choices on menu too. Reasonably priced. Overall, I would come again and try their other entrees.",

    "text": "MTO Cafe is a sight for sore downtown eyes. Anything original that falls outside the orbit of Freemont east and The Downtown Project is to be hailed out of the gate, and the good news is that MTO offers a fun menu, an inviting space, and cheerful service. Bonus points for mobile charging stations in the booths, a bottomless mimosa brunch, local delivery, special event suppers, vegan options, etch-a-sketches for kids, and a kitchen that likes to mix things up. These cats are hitting many right notes, and I'm happy to keep returning and supporting.   But there's a \"but.\" It's small \"but\" but it's crucial and can be summed up with the following moral principle (which I think comes from Psalms, and say it with me): A Tomato is a Privilege, Not a Right. MTO touts itself as the place to get \"fresh comfort food.\"  It's a solid concept. People love diner fare like skillets and pancakes. People also love the idea of garden fresh ingredients. MTO has both! Together! Fried potatoes and eggs WITH ARUGULA! Pancakes WITH FRESH BERRIES! Montague, meet Capulet.    But then the plates arrive, several times in a row now, and there they are. Three desperate slices of roma tomato that have no earthly reason for existing. Three pale pink, dry, mealy, insipid round disks that make a mockery of the whole \"fresh ingredients\" concept. It's a larger and more generally disturbing societal trend, this habituated tastelessness, but it's particularly glaring at a place that hangs its hat on the notion of seasonality. A tomato, say it with me once again, is a privilege. It grows for a few months in the summer, arrives in our kitchens bursting with the juice of sun beams, and merely asks to be sliced thick and dressed with some sea salt and cracked pepper and a drizzle of olive oil. Torn fresh basil if you have it. When you taste it you taste the earth and the sky while nymphs play the fiddle and dance. It is a near-sacred experience that we get to enjoy for a short time each summer, and then we pack away our longings until next year. We accept a life without tomatoes for the better part of the year. We ignore those crunchy, gassed-up grocery store imitations from Mexico. We hold out, we say \"no,\" because we understand that proper tomatoes are worth the wait.    The existence of the pale, crunchy roma tomato is our collective failure as a consuming public. We should be better than this. We should all think we deserve better, because we do. The MTO kitchen staff can't fully be blamed for this sad culinary ritual, because apparently we have all of us simultaneously fallen asleep at the tomato wheel. But a restaurant that prides itself on fresh ingredients and seasonality should have a finer sense of what counts as fresh, and what doesn't, and if these pale pink impostors can sneak under the kitchen's radar then one's confidence is a little shaken. Don't settle for what your customers settle for, MTO. Not everything is fresh all the time. I'd happily settle for roasted red peppers, or pretty much anything pickled. Or simply nothing at all, which would be better than negative-tomato.",

It has carmelized onions that are cooked in red wine which go well with the velveeta, somehow.  - French Onion Soup- it's huge- it has shredded cheese on top of the melted cheese on top of the crouton.  I get a side caesar salad with this for $3.  So $10 total for HUGE soup and good sized side salad.  - Lattes- Coffee or latte is only $3! Actually cheaper than Sbux! - Fried Apple Rings- doesn't need much explanation.   Could Use Some Work: - Vinaigrette dressing is very bitter, I feel like it's 99% pure vinegar. Their ranch is great though, you can tell it's home made. Get that instead.  The vinaigrette will seriously melt your teeth.    - No appetizers on the menu! Only side dishes :(",

The food was really amazing I had the Turkey Melt and it was quite exquisite, the ingredients in the Melt tasted really fresh and delicious where I also tried the Fat Elvis and it was greasy and delicious.  I also tried the Apple Doughnuts thing which was interesting because it was basically a healthy doughnut.  The one main thing that I really liked was how fast the food came out as well as the service you receive from people.",

Order the special which comes with several cured meats, three eggs, toast, and potatoes  meats were just OK. Bacon all day and no smoke. One type of sausage was stone cold. Sunny side up eggs had runny whites. Big negative in my book.   Showed up with only two eggs, and when i pointed that out they effort offered to cook me an egg.  So no harm no foul there.  Service was great.  Atmosphere pleasant. The food was just OK.",

They even validate parking and we took advantage of the free chocolate chip cookie if you check in on Yelp.

Fast forward to my visit - Meh.  Just meh.  The restaurant itself is beautiful and I really like the concept of farm fresh food cooked to order but with a slightly eclectic menu.  That's about where the good ends for me.  First of all, this place is in the so called 'arts' district of Las Vegas.  The area is up and coming but still has a lot of coming left to do.  I am no stranger to downtown - I work right off of Fremont, so I'm used to the re-gentrified-but-not-quite all the way there vibe.  It's kind of dicey & the parking situation is terrible.  We went on a not-so-busy morning & could not find street parking anywhere.  We had to park in the garage, which isn't that big of a deal.  I suppose in that area, your car would be safer in the garage anyhow.    The food was good.. not great.  I had a waffle and a side of bacon.  This is what really got me though - the waffle was the size of an Ego (you know, the frozen kind you can buy in your grocer's freezer section) and cost $9.  NINE DOLLARS.  For one waffle.  The bacon was an extra $3.  I'm no huge cheapskate - I'll shell out the $$ for a great meal - but for crying out loud... For $9, there should be at least two waffles & some powdered sugar on top.    My husband and the rest of our party enjoyed their salmon skillet breakfast dish very much, so I think this is a case of 'It really depends on what you order'.  Some dishes are obviously better than others.  I'm sure I'll give MTO another shot at some point.  I'll try something other than the waffle.",

I ordered through these guys while in my hotel before I walked over to pickup the order and get an Uber to my partner's workshop for a lunch delivery.  These guys have a corner just down off Freemont. It was a pleasant walk from my hotel to their shop. Easy to find as well.  Huge glass and signage let you know you've arrived. As you walk in there's some seats to your left and turning right means you get to walk into the cafe itself. There's a bar with stools running along it where you can sit and watch the cooks and staff running about filling orders, or there's booths as well as tables and chairs if you wanted to have your food delivered to you.  I imagine this place would be pumping with a lunch crowd and I may have missed the rush by getting in before noon. Either way, I took a seat on the stools to wait for my order.  The wait staff are very attentive and get your order to you quite quickly.  I had mine boxed up and bagged and ready to go in no time.  I also ordered some fresh squeezed juices. Although to be fair for the price I was paying for the juices I was expecting a bit more juice than I actually got. Maybe bigger cups would help in future.  Otherwise the salad and wrap hit the spot and tasted amazing. I would happily go back here for more yums in the future when I'm back in Vegas.",

Then two of us got out breakfast. But my friend who is 8 months pregnant was still missing her food. They sent us some dessert. The food was just okay but the mimosas were good. To make things worse the server ran our credit cards on the wrong bill. So that took awhile to clear up. I may try to go back to see if my experience will be better. It felt like a bit of headache.

You do have to pay to park, they will validate your parking ticket but not completely. When we walked into the restaurant there was a rush which was strange to us because it was like 11:30 on a weekday before the lunch rush. There was an open table next to a couple eating but the ladies, purse was on the open table so they would not seat us until another table cleared which was over half an hour later. We were pretty irritated with the fact that they were unwilling to seat us. When we finally did get seated our service was extremely slow and from the time we entered the restaurant to the time we left the restaurant over one and a half hours passed, just for lunch! The music in the restaurant is extremely loud and we had to shout over the table to hear one another. We asked if the music could be lowered but we were rejected. Anyhow, thankfully the food was superb! Salads were large, fresh and the homemade dressing was divine! The sandwiches were amazing and everything was prepared perfectly. Aside from the horrible service and LOUD music, this place is amazing!",

Lots of windows and natural light pouring in which is pleasantly perfect for mid-morning brunch.  We were a group of 5 and had to wait about 15 minutes for a table but we didn't mind.  We sat at a big high top by the window.  Our server was very friendly and spent some time joking with our table.  The lunch menu looks great as well!    - $15 bottomless mimosas or bloodys.  Not a bad deal but they are a little slow on the refills   - egg dishes were great; you can order them as a wrap, skillet or omelette.  You just get some sliced tomatoes with the omelette which is a little unfortunate for the price  - if you like pancakes, get the vegan carrott and coconut pancakes!  don't let the vegan part turn you off.  These were delish  - mash hash - yum!  basically hash browns on top of mash potatoes.  Can't believe I've never thought of that one before.      - And don't forget the free chocolate chip cookie for checking in on yelp!  fresh out of the oven.",

Upon turning to yelp, we received our answer...M.T.O.  AMAZEBALLZ! Everything was fresh, delicious and served by an awesome waitress who made excellent recommendations. Each of us ordered something different and we were all equally jealous of what the others had ordered...yet stoked with our own orders.  Seeing as I was still pretty much drunk, I don't recall what I ordered exactly...but I have photographic evidence for assistance. Suffice it to say, it was a monsterous pile of delicious breakfast fare and it didn't last long on my plate.

My wife chose an order of lemon poppy seed pancakes with blueberry-ginger compote that no one short of Fat Albert could possibly finish in one sitting.  My avocado griddle -  eggs with tomatillo sauce, red onions, cilantro, poblano peppers and jack cheese over home fries was more than filling.  Hers was good, mine was nothing short of excellent.",

The staff was very pleasant, friendly, and efficient. We all loved the over sized coffee/tea cups. The menu choices were awesome. I had the MTO breakfast with 3 eggs and different meats, and their amazing hash browns. I'm not one to eat sausage, but when I took a bite of the homemade chicken sausage, I was blown away at how nicely flavored and fresh it tasted. The turkey bacon was one of the best I've had. My girlfriend had the lemon poppy seed pancakes with fresh blueberry compote. Her words were, \"wow, these are like a party in your mouth, they're so good.\" Of course, I had to try them & they were amazing! The blueberries were the best flavored and fresh tasting. My other friend had the chicken skillet and raved about the fresh tomatoes and perfectly blended flavors.  When we were finished, the owner came over and spoke to us for a while. He shared that they get their produce from a farm in northern California - all no pesticides. They don't keep a freezer on the property because all of their food is fresh & free of all the \"bad stuff.\" We could tell, because it was a two-thumbs up, five star place! I'll recommend this to other friends and will definitely return.",

Our server Fred had no intuition or common sense. When we asked him for extra napkins, he brought 1 (1!) napkin. He forgot to get my toddler a drink and when he remembered he brought it in an enormous glass cup. Toddlers are fantastic with large full cups. After our food was delivered he checked on us (duly noted, points given) then disappeared for 45 minutes. I had to ask another server for our check, and she seemed so annoyed that we dared to bother her. As for Fred, he was too busy flirting to pay attention to his tables. I hope he got some numbers.  I understand that hiring a young waitstaff is exciting because they are cute & nice to be around. They can also be inexperienced. That inexperience can come off as arrogance and hurt your business.  I'll be back, when I do my hair & makeup so I can keep my server's attention, but I won't be bringing my friends or family.",

Started with the green juice which had a combination of good flavors, but a very strong presence of celery and lemon dominated the drink. Those flavors should be dulled down a bit to create a balanced and enjoyable drink. For breakfast I had the Kentucky Fried Chicken and the bacon pancake dippers. The KFC was awesome with a great tasting flavor combination that readily complimented each component. The gravy was my favorite part. Will get an extra side order of gravy next time. The bacon pancake dippers are good, but my expectations were overinflated. The lack of flavor was disappointing. Added flavors like lemon, orange, chocolate, blueberries, and red velvet would drastically improve this dish. The peppercorn syrup only tasted like syrup. Ended the breakfast with the complimentary warm gooey chocolate chip cookie provide for free with the check in on Yelp. So delicious! Great friendly and helpful customer service was provided.",

For brunch, it's like \"hangover heaven\" with a lot of options when you've had a few too many the night before. I had the \"Kentucky Fried Chicken,\" which is a fried chicken breast, a few eggs, very little potatoes and hash browns. It sounded like a lot of food but was pretty small, especially when compared to the photo of it on the flat screen TV. Their beer is super limited, which makes me think that I'd only go back for brunch. There are some other great options, like \"Chicken in a Waffle.\" Im too curious not to go back and try it!",

Our server was friendly and her timing was good. I ordered the grilled cheese. It had honey, brie, toasted walnuts and brioche between two thick slices of butter crisped bread. It came w a side of simple salt and pepper greens w a side of vinaigrette. I enjoyed this a lot. It was just a tad too sweet but quite delicious. My husband had the chicken and waffles w fries which he inhaled so I'm assuming he really liked it. And my niece ordered the chorizo omelette. That was super tasty. Chorizo, roasted tomatoes and piquollo peppers were folded in super fluffy eggs. This was topped w avo...my fave. Also, they validated parking for $1.50. Our parking total was $3 but we did take a 5 minute stroll to Fremont street to play in the golden nugget for a quick second",

I couldn't finish it and it was really cheap too! $13 for my dish. The chicken was extremely juicy and not dry at all. The fiance had the Hangover Burger and it was juicy as well. He killed it. I would come back to try out the other stuff but I would probably order the same thing because it was so good.",

Came here with a large group of friends on a Sunday for breakfast/brunch before leaving Las Vegas to return back to Los Angeles. The great reviews are what led us here. I guess you can say that we left disappointed.  First off, we had terrible service. It took forever for them to get a table ready for us, despite a half empty restaurant. When we finally did get seated, the wait to order was very slow, and when we finally did order, the food came out months later. I think I grew a couple gray hairs here. The servers seemed friendly, but they just could not get it together.  The ambiance is nice. It's a seemingly clean restaurant, with a modern look to it. Nothing bad to say about it. Definitely a small, trendy cafe kind of a place.  I ordered the steak and eggs, which were A-OK. Nothing noteworthy in terms of taste, but not bad. The quantity was large, which is a plus. Also, when I went, there was a Yelp check-in offer for a free cookie. The cookie was alright. It was free, so I can't complain. Prices were reasonable.  Summary: MTO Cafe offers a pretty average breakfast experience all-around, mixed with some of the slowest service I've ever encountered. The prices are fine, the food is OK, the quantities are huge, and the atmosphere is nice.",

Case in point, this bright and welcome addition to the downtown dining scene.   The restaurant itself is pretty small, and there's a relatively limited menu. But the portions are big, and you can choose from such cafe favorites as burgers, salads, sandwiches, and breakfast items. It looked like their breakfast items are popular, because I saw lots of pancakes and waffles passing by. But I was there for lunch.   I chose the BLT chopped salad ($9) and added half an avocado for $1. It was like a deconstructed wedge salad, with cherry tomatoes and ranch dressing. And that's a good thing! The bacon was crisp and delicious, and although I'm not a big fan of tomatoes, they gave the salad the right amount of pop. (You can also add chicken for an additional charge, but I was fine with my avocado.)  My only gripe is that I ordered iced tea, and it looks like the only choice is passion fruit, because I wasn't offered an option and that's what I got. Next time, I'll skip the $3 glass of liquid potpourri and stick with water.  My server was great--super friendly and attentive without being intrusive. And the food was fresh, fast, and filling. Overall, I'd say MTO is pretty GR8.",

I write this review in loving memory of it and the gorgeous experience I am savoring on a cold Vegas morning, in this warm, badass, and unpretentious cafe.  5   S T A R S  * DELICATE & DEEEEELISH  :::: Kentucky Fried Chicken: They had me at \"KFC\". The name grabbed my attention immediately--brilliant. Is this the original, original recipe the Colonel intended--perhaps the 'director's cut' of chicken breast? Silky eggs laid on a crispy, breaded and pleasurably moist breast. Delicate gravy, tasting of sweet southern roux poured over the top. Yummy, yum, yum 'Mash Browns' hidden underneath to surprise me. \"Wha, good mornin' spuds!\" The whole dish crafted with loving subtlety, the volume just perfect, like tucking in Goldilocks. MTO, you have my gratitude. :::: Hangover Burger: Decent, and HUGE. The bacon was incredible, shoestring fries stellar, but all that protein was really heavy in the tummy. Be warned--it's the only thing I needed to eat for 7 hours.  * AN ANTIDOTE TO LONELINESS You ever feel lonely in Vegas? Giant sky, big buildings separated by lakes of space filled with roaming crowds of random party people. For me, these new experiences are a welcomed blast but without my wife there's a melancholy lurking. Maybe that tinge is part of why we booze and party to excess in LV. Well, what I just ate has healed my lonely heart. I'll def be back tomorrow when the isolation resumes :)  * ATTENTIVE SERVICE Very nice dudes checking in on me often and letting me take my time to write this review!  * GREAT MUSIC / COMFORTABLE SETTING Louis Armstrong's horn. 2000s Rock with subtle cowbell. All tunes upbeat and go perfectly with the coffee and the subtly-more-hip-than-your-average-diner setting.  * EASY & UNPRETENTIOUS The biggest surprise of my Las Vegas restaurant experiences thus far is the rare combination of fine quality and the lack of pretension. That subtle Vegas unpretentious ease is present here at MTO in the caramel vinyl seats, the not-overdone lighting fixtures, the easy attitudes of the staff, and the comfortable body language of the Average-Jill-and-Joe patrons.   Being from Oakland and SF, I've always had to choose between lack of pretension or fine quality. It's a real delight, therefore, to experience them mingled together in the same place.",

    "text": "I've been back a couple of times since I wrote my first review.  Most recently I had the avocado omelet (red onions, cilantro, jalapeno peppers, jack cheese, topped with avocado and tomatillo sauce) and it was really, really good.  Super filling too.  Lots of cheese, jalapenos, and that tomatillo sauce was perfect.  It didn't come with potatoes but it was so large I couldn't even finish it so the lack of a side wasn't an issue. I tried the MTO juice this time and damn, it was freaking delicious. On another visit, I had the Falafel (chick peas, tomato, lettuce, onion, balsamic tahini on unleavened bread + simple greens ) and it was quite good as well.  The consistency of the quality of food has made this place a must for me whenever I visit Vegas. The only downside for me on this most recent visit was the service.  I'm not sure if our server was new or what but she pretty much ignored us and we were helped by a smattering of other people.  When she came over to take our drink order we tried to order food too but she took off as soon as we told her our drinks and from that point, we really didn't see her again.  Maybe she delivered our drinks? But she certainly didn't take our food order when she did.  Not a single person checked on us after our food was brought over (by another person that wasn't our server).  No one asked if we needed anything else. Luckily we didn't and the food was great.  I had to flag down someone else to get the check to finally get out of there. I won't let the experience deter me because the food is that good and hopefully it was a fluke.",

Like salad with a side dip, which is a shame as the dressing supposedly was home made.   We also enjoyed a vegetarian scramble, which by itself was rather bland, but otherwise we'll executed. Add some herbs, basil, thyme, something... We retorted to drowsing it in hot sauce. For some odd reason thisplace does T have fresh ground pepper. Odd.   The coconut carrot pancake was delicious, really tasty.  We'll be back but will never order a salad again.",

I enjoy leaving the strip for breakfast whenever I visit Las Vegas and since I was going to the container park anyway I decided to stop by.  We got seated right away and the wait staff was friendly and attentive. I ordered the MTO Breakfast and the MTO juice. I don't remember what was in the juice but it was delicious. The breakfast is 3 eggs cooked to order, mash browns, bacon, chicken sausage link, spam and toast. This is a LOT of food. I ordered my eggs as over medium, 2 were over hard and the third was barely over medium. The eggs were also just a tad too greasy.  I think I would go back, but I wouldn't go out of my way to visit.",

They had heard about MTO, but hadn't gone so we decided to all go and try it out. The mimosas were pricey ($19.99 per person), and they served them from a jug with the champagne and orange juice already mixed together. Every time we wanted a refill we had to specifically request to receive the champagne separate from the OJ. The servers never remembered, so we literally had to ask with every refill. We asked if they could bring a small jug of OJ for the table and just bring refills of champagne, but they said that they weren't allowed to do that. I like to concoct my own juice to bubbly ratio, so that was a bummer. The food was ok. Looked better than it tasted. The service was also ok. Took awhile to get drink refills. It wasn't very crowded, so the noise level was good. I did think it was cool that there were power outlets at every table so you could charge your devices. Brunch ends right at 2pm, and they also close the restaurant at that time. Secret hopes of extended drinking were quickly dashed.",

Waiter basically recommended to go one at a time and if you hit 4, then we'll switch to bottomless.  -Kentucky fried chicken: chicken itself was pretty bland, but paired with everything else worked well (including my staple breakfast condiment combo of ketchup and Cholula). Got mine with an over medium egg. Mashed Browns were a cool combo of mashed potatoes and hash browns. Good combo.   If I find myself ever staying in downtown again, I'd come back.

He kept forgetting the things we would ask for and was extremely apologetic but still lacking.

The manager however salvaged the experience by not trying to contest what I was saying and immediately asked how she could make it right! Kudos to her!

Deprived of my decaf coffee on my first visit, I brought my own I decaf the second time around.

My theory is still that people don't wake up early enough around there for a lot of breakfast-dedicated establishments to be profitable...but that's probably BS. Whatever, it doesn't matter.  I decided on this cafe because they have lemon poppyseed pancakes with blueberry compote. I don't know why more places don't offer this type of pancake, but because so few of them do, I love getting them whenever I can.   As stated in my other reviews, I hold breakfasts to a higher standard than other meals. It's the most important. It's my favorite. Ya better not screw it up.  Well, MTO definitely didn't screw it up. These poppyseed cakes are DIVINE!   Typically I'm not a fan of lemon, but when it's paired with the cakey pancake, the nutty poppy seeds, and the sweet blueberries, it's irresistible.   My friend ordered the scrambled eggs and bacon, because he's a simple kind-a guy. I dig it though - they're the cornerstone of a well-balanced breakfast.   He likes bacon that isn't too crispy or too chewy, so the bacon was perfectly cooked for him. He wasn't as much of a fan for the eggs, but they got the job done.  This orange cafe is a refreshing and safe change from the series of perhaps-questionable stops on your Vegas Strip visit.",

We mentioned to our waitress that we're scrambling for time, but she was very accommodating and put in our order right away. While waiting for our table we had already looked through most of the Yelp pictures.  I decided on the Fat Elvis (french toast with banana, strawberry, nutella, and PB) and my husband ordered the Kentucky fried chicken.  As much as I love my sweet french toast, I really enjoyed the savory dish a lot more! The hash brown and the ham that came with the boneless fried chicken was delicious! The whole plate was super yummy!  Good thing I have a willing to share husband!  Don't forget to Yelp check-in for a warm chocolate cookie! We made it to our show on time thanks to our waitress for the fast and friendly service.  I will definitely allow more time to enjoy the food here next time I'm in Vegas.",

They do offer a brunch menu and bottomless mimosas option on the weekend. I had the chicken and waffles which was divine. I never had a variation of this dish served like this before and it was excellent.  The staff was friendly and the prices were fair.  TIP: if you do park in the adjacent parking garage get your ticket validated. You will have to put your parking ticket and the validated ticket into the parking machine before you go back to your car. Make sure the machine gives you a receipt because you will need to swipe it to get out of the garage.",

    "text": "My family and I decided to drop in for breakfast before making the drive back home.   The food is great, but unfortunately the same can't be said about the customer service.  Initially, the only criticism we had was when my sister-in-law told the server she did not want her coffee, because it tasted like it had been sitting out for awhile. Rather than offering to brew a new pot, or some simple statement of acknowledgement/apology, he just blankly stared at her and said, \"Uh....okay?\".  From that point, our server maintained a noticeably negative attitude towards her.   At the end of our meal, we were brought our check. My sister-in-law went to speak with the server to request that the one check be split into three. The server appeared to be confused by this request and asked what she meant. He asked who was going to pay for the meals. Again, it was reiterated that each couple would be paying for their own meals. Eventually,  he agreed to split the check, but the moment my SIL turned her back to return to the table, the waiter started glaring at her as she walked back.  Shortly after, a gentleman claiming to be the manager came by our table and my SIL expressed her concerns regarding her experience.   Now, we aren't expecting the dude to be reprimanded or fired for a bad attitude or whatever, but I also feel there is a lack professionalism when you're seen laughing and pal'ing around with the server in question.  Tl;dr - Food is good. Service was bad. Management is dismissive and any remotely constructive criticism brought to his attention will simply be shrugged off.",

The menu is awesome - really innovative food combinations and a nice offering for different dietary needs.    Oddly, I had a steak salad for brunch.  (Don't judge me...brunch means breakfast AND lunch people.)  The steak was awesome - and so was the coffee.  The b/f had The Fat Elvis - some concoction of banana, nutella, peanut butter and carb-loaded goodness.  It looked incredible and from the empty plate he left, I suspect he thought so too.  Two OJ's, a coffee, 2 breakfasts, and a side of fruit DID really hike the cost up though - I think it was like fifty something dollars for brekkie.  Not a cheap spot, but worth it for the ambience, the quality of food, and creativity of the menu.",

Yuppie?\"  I brought my mom and bro-dizzle to MTO in their first foray of downtown Las Vegas and the place was hopping for a Sunday morning. We were greeted right away by the gentleman working the counter who turned out to be the proud papa of one of the co-owners. While perusing the menu in our quoted 5-10 minute wait, he suggested what to eat if we were \"really hungry,\" and what to order if we were \"just hungry.\"   Among the 3 of us, we ordered the avocado breakfast as a skillet, though it was also available as a whole wheat wrap or omelette; the queso carne sandwich; and the bacon dippers. The avocado skillet had a green chili topping that gave it a kick so even though I asked for ketchup and hot sauce, it turned out I really didn't need too much of it, if at all. The queso carne was exactly like it sounded - lots of queso with lots of carne topped on fluffy slices of bread. The bacon dippers was a platter of Americana lovin' - carbs and bacon, married in one item - essentially strips of bacon right in the middle of pancake mix. The presentation wasn't as mind-blowing as the other two items, but the flavor was there. +1 for bacon lovers!   The cafe is bright and a very modernized, contemporary step up from the usual diners throughout the city. There aren't any $3.99 steak and eggs, but there are $15 bottomless mimosas and bloody Marys!   P.S. Check in on Yelp for a free order of walnut tossies - they were out when we went, but sent over an equally-winning mini apple pie! :)",

I wasn't expecting it to really be waffle sandwich with chicken. That was pretty amazing.   The price was about $13 which is pretty standard for breakfast. The coffee came in a pretty big cup but the vegetable juice was kind of small.  I received the free walnut tossie with Yelp Check in which was delicious.  The only gripe I had with this place is that parking isn't free and you have to pay $3 but otherwise, definitely love this place. I usually stay in Downtown Las Vegas so this place is super close by.",

    "text": "MTO Cafe: Made To Order. This is a nice, new, cheery spot located across the street from City Hall, on the first floor of the parking garage right there. A friend and I met for a meal on a recent Friday at 11:00am and were seated right away. The menu offers up breakfast and lunch items, many of them comfort food style: chicken n waffles, grilled cheese sandwiches, as well as a Fat Elvis sandwich (French toast, Nutella, bacon, peanut butter, and strawberries).  The 'made to order' part applies to the breakfast, where you can choose a wrap, omelet, or skillet form for options that include avocado, salmon, chicken, chili, and broccoli. I had the MTO breakfast:  3 eggs, chicken sausage, 2 slices of turkey bacon, 2 slices of regular bacon, 2 slices of Spam, mash browns, and toast.  Opting for egg whites and sourdough toast, it was a larger than normal meal for me with all of that meat.  The bacon was made just right, but the Spam wasn't cooked long enough and the turkey bacon was buried underneath the eggs and just limp. The chicken sausage was good, too.  The mash browns are a combo of mashed potatoes and hash browns and I enjoyed those very much.  I left one slice of Spam and half a slice of chicken sausage on my plate, full from all that food.   I used my Yelp check-in offer of free Walnut Tossies when we got there.  Our server had never seen it before so she took my phone over to another waitress who cleared it with her boss.  Said boss, Ben, came over to our table and introduced himself as one of the owners.  Apparently I was the first person to use the check-in so he asked how it worked on the phone app, I showed him, and he was very happy.  I was happy with the Walnut Tossies at the end of the meal for dessert, 3 little mini-pastries of walnut and brown sugar.   Overall, it was a good experience, especially since my friend treated me to this meal.  I don't spend $14 on breakfast on a normal basis, but I'll come back to try some of the lunch items.  MTO Cafe is a cool addition to Downtown and nice to have as a dining option there.",

Now, the BLTAE was amazing and plentiful! The bacon was thickly sliced and loads of them. They didn't go cheap on us. The egg was shockingly an amazing addition to what I already love with the BLTA. It makes it so much more flavorful and rich...however, it was a lot for me to consume. I would recommend asking for the egg, on the side, if you don't like the idea or can't take too much richness in your food. It can be overwhelming.   We haven't tried anything else, but from the service and food that we have, we would definitely come back.",

I think that it is across the street from City Hall, and judging by the suits, it seems like many of the people who frequent this spot work there. However, the place it self has sort of a hippy vibe. I'm a huge fan of the large windows letting in natural light, the mix of booths and high top tables.  Their menu is mostly breakfast food, and then typical american food (hamburgers, salads, and sandwiches). Everything on the menu sounded pretty good -- seemed \"wholesome\" and mostly healthy.  I ordered the avocado skillet and my friend ordered the broccoli omelette. Both were good! They had plenty of \"stuff\" in them (I hate it when they skimp on the filling). We also got a side order of seasonal veggies. It was a bit odd that they put hashbrowns at the bottom of the skillet. Personally, I would have preferred breakfast potatoes or something that I could mix in more with the eggs. They veggies seemed a bit over cooked, but the vignette they put on it was good! Everything was solid -- all tasty and well done. Nothing was mind-blowing awesome, but everything was really good.",

    "text": "We were heading out to the container park and decided to hit MTO Cafe for a late brunch beforehand. MTO is located on Main St. just across the street from the new City Hall. And even though I can only think of the Food Network when I see their logo, I really liked the feel of this place. It seems like it's a window into the new downtown vision of hip and cool spots. It is fairly small inside though and even at 1pm, we had to wait about 10 minutes for a table.   The menu is pretty extensive featuring breakfast, lunch and even a couple vegan options. We decided to start off with an order of the mini donuts. Hey, life's short so eat dessert first, right?! They brought out an order of two donuts that were unfortunately just a step above being raw. I hate sending food back but they were pretty much indelible. Our waitress was great, she apologized, took them back and got us a new order right away. The properly cooked ones were delicious! They have a slightly crisp exterior but soft on the inside and topped with honey and powdered sugar but not overly sweet. Definitely a must try!  I opted for the chicken in a waffle and while I'm not usually not a fan of the sandwich style version, MTO's was a hit for me. It's a bit messy so you'll most likely be knife and forking it anyway. The waffle was great, it's light and fluffy with a hint of sweetness. I thought the chicken was a bit \"soft\" but still very flavorful. It definitely needed to be more crispy. In my opinion though, the star of this dish is the sauce. I'm not sure exactly what it is, though I saw mention of it being a form of bechamel sauce. Whatever it is, it's tasty! It's a bit thick like gravy but was similar to hollandaise sauce in flavor. It's a got a touch spice that balanced out the sweet waffle and trust me, you can just leave the syrup off your plate for this one!  My wife ordered the lemon poppy seed pancakes which were really taste. Moist yet fluffy pancakes with an excellent compute of blueberries and ginger. These are 3 large pancakes and can easily be shared for those with smaller appetites. My son ordered a grilled cheese which was one of the better I've ever tasted in a restaurant and was served with a generously portioned fresh fruit cup.   If you're looking for a cool spot to grab breakfast or brunch, MTO should be on your list. They have some pretty unique menu items and even serve beer. How can you beat a good brewski to go along with your \"hangover burger\"? The prices are a bit high but that's expected for place like this and they at least make up for it with pretty huge portions. Solid 4 stars all around!",

Location -  MTO Cafe is tucked in downtown Las Vegas away from the craziness and chaos of the strip. But if you are looking to gamble after a great meal, the cafe is only a few blocks down from the Gold Nugget and other DTLV locales. The cafe itself is simply decorate with a bight interior paint job and large wall art.   The food -  MTO had a decent sized menu, and everything on it sounded de-lish! I ended up getting the \"broccoli\" (egg whites, spinach, Tillamook cheddar, jalapeno, mushrooms) as an omelette (other options were a wrap or skillet) and it was AMAZING. I am in LOVE with breakfast foods and this was one of the best tasting and well-crafted omelettes that I've had, and it was just the perfect amount to boot! I also had their green juice which had the perfect mix of fruits and veggies so that it didn't taste like the \"typical\" green juice which is basically liquefied salad, hold the dressing.   My other family members ordered the \"avocado\" (tomatillo sauce, red onions, cilantro, poblano peppers, jack cheese) and the \"Kentucky fried chicken\" (fried chicken with two eggs, mash browns, country gravy) and they were also equally amazing.   To finish off our breakfast, we could not resist trying their mini donuts, and it was definitely worth it!  Overall, if you're looking for a great place to eat that isn't a buffet or cost an arm and a leg to eat a delicious meal, this is the place to go to.",

Bright, open space with large windows looking out towards the new Las Vegas city hall building with a choice of an outdoor seating area that would be best enjoyed in warmer months.   A bestie and I decided to share all our dishes so we could get a better idea of the menu. We enjoyed the baked potato soup with crispy slices of bacon to garnish (which was the perfect warm-me-up, comfort-food starter); the tomato basil soup accompanied by a miniature grilled-cheese sandwich; the Elvis Breakfast French toast sandwich (which was more like dessert rather than a lunch sandwich but I was not about to complain about it); and the buffalo Rueben sandwich (I'll eat sauerkraut on anything and this was a unique pairing to me). I had a soup-bowl-sized cup of coffee and my friend had a fresh juice made with a plethora of healthy green goodness that helped balance out our carb-loaded lunch. All the dishes were DELISH.  Service was great as well. Our server was very attentive and kept my coffee cup full which is a requirement for a good review when coffee is involved at a sit down restaurant. I will also come back to try the $15 mimosa brunch special with the ladies. I think Mimosas make any brunch just a little bit brighter.",

    "text": "Went to have some brunch at MTO it is a neat space, with minimal decorations that kept our attention. Being from restaurants we always watch the operations of the kitchen and the wait staff. The first red flag we saw the expediter eating French fries in front of the line, in front of all the customers, gross. You have an open kitchen yes but duck in the back and feed your face. From the waiter he said his name was Jose or something like that. We asked if the chef was on duty and the waiter also said no, probably why the whole kitchen was a free for all and slow. First we ordered the pancake dippers. It was a plain over mixed pancake with bacon in it sliced into strips. Nothing fancy. Then we watched the expediter \"Jose\" walk over to a table and shake someone's hand with his gloves on.  We then ordered our sandwiches. I had the tree hugger. I think if I ate a tree it would have had more flavor than this. It was a good concept and that's all the good I can say about that. It was a quinoa bun two patties. That had absolutely no flavor at all. It had some kind of sauce in the middle and a few leaves of spinach and a few small tomatoes. It had the potential to be good if they used a little seasoning salt or some herbs or anything that could flavor the cardboard patties. The coffee was good. The hangover burger we ordered was cooked perfect and was juicy. If we were going to come back I would order the burger. It  The fries are bag fries nothing special. We ended up paying fifty dollars which seems very expensive for a mediocre brunch. It is Comparable price to EAT, with less flavor in the food.",

We were seated within 5 minutes and our drink orders were taken quickly. Our server seemed personable and was prompt in taking our orders.  It was probably about 20 min before our food arrived- 2 Black & Bleu burgers. They were good and were accompanied by skinny fries which were good but nothing special. The Ranch dressing I asked for on the side was totally blah though.  It may have been made on the premises but again, nothing special.   Our server never came by to refill our iced tea or to check on us. I wanted to order the Apple rings and  it was about 20-25 minutes before she came back to us. I ordered the rings. She had said they typically take about 5 minutes to make - 15 minutes later, they arrived. The apple rings were yummy! Definitely the high point of meal.  Most likely we would never come back- not because the food was bad or the service horrible but there was nothing spectacular about the meal and it just took too long for a work day lunch.",

    "text": "I came to MTO Cafe the second day it had opened. Like Bonnie C., I too am confused how there are reviews about the place before it had opened. The reviewers don't mention a soft-opening....  Anywho, I must say that I was very excited to check the place out, since another place to eat lunch downtown is always welcome. But in this case I have to say I left a little sad.   I had checked out their menu before heading over and had my eye on a couple of items. We were promptly seated and brought our drinks and while my friend perused the menu I checked out the decor. The place looks great, with nice big windows and a 50's diner meets modern bistro vibe. I ordered the Queso Carne, per the menu is skirt steak, velveeta cheese and red wine drunken onions. The waitress said it was a wrap. My friend ordered the Tree Hugger, with quinoa and veggies. The waitress asked my friend if he wanted any sides and my friend said no. When she brought out his dish we saw that it LITERALLY was just the quinoa patty. No bread, no sides. What?!? Granted, she did ask if he wanted a side, but if she had specified how diminutive the dish was he might've ordered something else. My dish came on a hamburger bun (which was really good, btw) not a wrap as the waitress had said. It had fries with it, which were fresh and tasty, although the menu did not specify it came with fries.   I think there should be a bit of consistency on the menu, how can some dishes come with a side and others don't? My burger was ok, the meat wasn't really skirt steak, and it was more like little cubes of meat. I think our meals were overpriced. We left feeling a bit deflated.   I will be back to give them another try for their breakfast because I've seen pictures of the dishes and they look larger than the lunch dishes.",

The staff here is amazing, our waitress was very friendly and her food knowledge was tremendous. There were five of us so we decided to try many dishes. Started of course by the ladies having bottomless mimosas. Food, yes we had food. I had the 3 egg with meat breakfast. The meat was as follows. Bacon, turkey sausage, turkey bacon, AND spam. That is right I said AND not OR. I guess AND is better. The other folks atheist table ordered many more blends of food. I will start with \"The fat Elvis\". A French toast sandwich with bananas, Nutella and bacon. This was very tasty and very rich in flavor a salty, sweet. Masterpiece. Harry's Berries, waffles with this delightful mix of Berries on the top, the waffle was light and was not too filling. Lemon poppy seed pancakes also with a fruit medley on top and a fruit compote drizzled over the top. Light and flavorful mix, the lemon not too overpowering. Chicken in a waffle, chicken fried chicken inside a waffle sandwich covered in chicken gravy. Chicken was moist, and the waffle light and airy. The gravy on top was definitely home made and filled with flavor. Smoked salmon omelet. This omelet has pieces of salmon and cream cheese soaked into the middle. Eggs were fluffy and the smokey flavor of the salmon with the combination of the cream cheese was like lochs and cream cheese in an egg dish. Amazing. What is a meal without desert. Yes we had desert, recommended by one of the owners. Forgive me for forgetting his name. We had Mini Donuts and Fried Apple Ring. The donuts were coated in powdered sugar and drizzled in honey grown over the hump in Pahrump. Very tasty, but over powered by the fact we still had the fried apple rings. These fried apple rings were awesome. A cut Granny Smith deep fried and served with a cinnamon sugar sauce that we could not get enough of.   We will be back to this new Gem of downtown. The staff was very attentive, our drinks were never empty. Always a plus with me. The menu is simple one page of choices. They are open for breakfast and lunch. We cannot wait to try the burgers and wraps. Some breakfast items can be had as a wrap as well.   Please check this out you will not be disappointed.",

MTO is awesome and far exceeded our expectations! If you picked it up and dropped it into Gourmet Ghetto it would raise breakfast standards there, perhaps even rivaling Meal Ticket, the all-time best.  Vegas clearly under-appreciates MTO as it was nearly empty when we came in at 11:20. By noon it filled up for lunch but given the quality and service I would expect a line.  The service is friendly and relaxed and was flawless on our visit.  We ordered both breakfast and lunch items and the food was outstanding. High quality ingredients expertly prepared. Not too much salt (the ubiquitous sin) and just the right balance of flavors.  (Adding real maple syrup instead of or in addition to the artificial corn syrup people are used to is the only suggestion for improvement we could think of.) The coffee is great. The Bloody Mary is modest, well-priced, delicious (but lacked even a celery stick- veggies suggested here - ok so two suggestions).  Fresh juices would also be a welcome addition but lack of them doesn't bring down my rating.  Great place! Definitely coming back and recommending to everyone we know.",

At the end of our meal we also overheard her asking the table next to us who had just cashed out to basically hurry up and leave because she needed to turnover the table smh. The service overall was ok a little slow they were pretty busy but all the severs were nice so it made up for it. The only other thing is the parking situation we didn't mind paying but I didn't realize till later they validated you would think out of courtesy they might mention that as they dropped the check since most people who go there park in the garage.",

My bf had the Kentucky Fried Chicken and he cleaned the plate. I think he liked it! The service was just as amazing as the food.  The waiters and servers were so warm and welcoming. I wanted no gravy and before our waiter reached the table he realized the cooks had forgotten to hold the gravy. He apologized and brought out another plate with the correct order. Overall, great experience! Love the decor too!",

    "text": "So sad and disappointing the 2nd time around.  The only reason I'm giving it 3 stars is because the first time I went it was a 5-star experience, but this time it was a 1-star experience.  Which was extra awful because I raved about it and brought my boss and co-worker... and then it sucked.  The server told us they had sauvignon blanc and they didn't.  No biggie, but combined with the rest of the service, it showed a server with a complete lack of knowledge of food and alcohol.  We ordered the Celery Sucker wrap, tomato soup, and green juice, all of which was awesome the first time around.  Juice and soup were good, Celery Sucker was terrible.  It didn't look right to me, and tasted bland and plain, and halfway into it I realized they didn't include the baba ghanoush--the main component of the wrap.  This is the equivalent to leaving out the hamburger patty in a cheeseburger.  So we asked about it, and the server told us they were out of baba ghanoush.  So why didn't they tell us that before they brought us these crappy wraps??  She didn't ask to substitute something in for it, like avocado.  They just hoped we didn't notice that half the ingredients weren't in the icky wrap.  So not only did the wrap suck, but they hoped we were stupid--you can't do that in Vegas, too many foodies here.  The server didn't apologize or ask to bring us something else; she didn't do ANYTHING.  She didn't even smile the whole time we were there.  She came off as generally not bright... so maybe I can't blame her??  Regardless, it was TERRIBLE service.  To top it all off, they'll validate your parking ticket, but the dumb bartender only validated part of it so we had to run 75 cents on a credit card because the machine doesn't take cash.  Awesome.  Needless to say, my boss and coworker were not impressed.  Don't know if I'll be back... if it weren't for the first time I went to MTO (when the food and service was excellent), I wouldn't give it another chance.",

Their customer service is really what sets them aside from most restaurants down here. They build connections with people and really aim to please, which is what its about, if the customer is happy, business is happy. I am anxious for the new location to open up in Summerlin soon, MTO has really become my favorite place to eat and being Vegan with many options to choose from its rare to have a place you dont mind eating at 4 times a week! They are making me go broke! lol, all in all, I am a permanent customer. Keep on doing what youre doing",

The only reason this is a 2 star and not a 1 is due to the fact that the front desk hostess young girl was on point.  * AVOCADO Omelet - TERRIBLE! Why? The Avocados hard as a rock. The Asian male Supervisor stopped by our table asked hows the food? I said taste the rock hard avocado.  He said no thanks are you finished? As he laughed and smiled. My Thai wife was stunned.  * Tap Water is nasty - Chlorine - Asked for 1 water for some reason 2 waters arrived at our table. Hey LAKE MEAD is almost empty slow down on the water wasting MTO waitress.  * Chicken and Waffles - nothing special. Best thing on the plate? Fries!   Here comes the bill aka check... Strange the 4 inch $ 11.00 AVOCADO Omelet still on the bill. I was stunned it wasnt removed by the Supervisor...I didnt want to wait for them to go thru the drama of removing the item so I just left a note on the TIP LINE.... SEE YELP!

Fortunately you can get a validation here, which is $1.50 off the charge meaning you are still left to pay 75 cents....why  Back to the business, entrance was inviting with friendly staffs greeting us. Place was hip and trendy with lots of seating.   I was craving burger so opted for their black and bleu burger which comes with fries on the side. Asked for medium but was more on the well done side. I still enjoyed it's thick and juicy patty. 5/5  I also got to try their Kentucky fried chicken which came with two eggs and a hash. Hash was nice and crisp, fried chicken was seasoned well and eggs were cooked to our preference. 5/5  Friendly staffs, amazing home cooking kind of breakfast and great vibe deserves 5 stars despite its parking situation.

It's even more fantastic than it sounds (and looks!), and I'd come back to their inconvenient downtown location with annoying garage parking just to have it again.  My guy raved just as much about the lemon poppy seed pancakes, though I would have appreciated more of the blueberry-ginger compote. I'm not much of a sugar for breakfast person, but we'll be coming back for the carrot and coconut version soon.   NOTE: Full menu available even at opening, which means you can channel your inner five year old and order mac and cheese for breakfast! Unfortunately, I found the Ritz-cracker crust unnecessarily thick and salty, and the noodles overcooked. It may be best to stick to bfast options after all.",

We both loved our breakfast :) Friendly service and they have 2 clean restrooms/bathrooms. One for women, which they label \"eggs\", and another for men which they label \"sausages\". Nice, cute humor. Overall, happy with our experience and would recommend.  PS. I did the check-in for the free choco chip cookie!",

My friends and I arrived and were seated right away. The place was almost packed but it's not crowded. There's a parking structure next to/above this place.   I ordered the avocado omelette and, unlike most places, the serving size was not overwhelmingly big. It is just the right size to get your day started. So then I ordered a side of their Lemon Poppyseed Blueberry Pancakes. I advise you to do the same. The taste, the fluffiness, the ingredients...yes! Those are pretty big and they serve three per plate so I shared with my table. The coffee is rich!   The service? Outstanding! You're greeted as soon you walk in and they're very attentive. Service is fast and your food is rapidly prepared. My next trip to Las Vegas I'll make sure to stop here and have the Kentucky Fried Chicken Biscuit w/ gravy (my friend had this, I had a bite and it was tasty! And not exactly big fan of gravy.",

    "text": "MTO serves up classic diner fare - sort of nice to get away from the fancy and flourish of the Strip for a bit.  It's a fairly straightforward menu, but one of their specialties caught my eye: Kentucky Fried Chicken, which is chicken fried chicken on top of hash browns, smothered in gravy with 2 eggs.  Whole bunch of food, but it was extremely satisfying and worth it. One thing different was the gravy - I think it's cinnamon in it that makes the gravy stand out a little TOO much, but I still polished off my plate.  Parking is a weird situation: 75 cents every 30 minutes in the garage, and MTO will validate 1 hour. MTO can get hella busy, and service can be pretty lax (friendly, though!) - just something to remember.  Thoroughly enjoyed a filling brunch, perfect to hike off!",

About my hamburger I notice my meat had a weird bad taste. I didn't finished it at all. Came home and started to feel sick of my stomach, chills, and vomiting. For some reason I feel that the hamburger made me sick.  I love this place since the 1st time I visited it. But today was not my day eating at MTO.",

I was greeted, seated and served very quickly by the very cute downtown hipsterish looking staff.  Ordered the Chicken in a Waffle, which was bomb. I need the recipe to that waffle batter because it was just that good...And I'm from Atlanta where Waffle House is very much a thing, so there's that. Chicken was nice, but wasn't too crazy about the gravy they had on the side. No biggie. Opted for mashbrowns instead of fries, which I think was a good choice.  Kinda pricey for breakfast food, but it was all yum, so no complaints here, especially since I snagged a $5 off <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FRestaurants.com&s=92a32e879a8bc9bad14f389149e0a62a99ba27f54b2dca87b4d713cffa7973a9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Restaurants.com</a> coupon for this trip.

Parking is 0.75/30 minutes, but MTO will give you a stamp card for 1 hour.  The restaurant was full when we got there.  There was a part of 3 in front of us.  We were quoted a 15 minute wait but it ended up being close to 30 minutes.  Not exactly the staff's fault for people not leaving, but the staff wasn't exactly attentive enough to flip the tables that were done eating.  It took a good 10 minutes after being seated before our server got to take our order.  Then..we just waited some more.  I had the Kentucky Fried Chicken.  The food presentation was so so, with the egg in top falling apart.  The chicken was not bad, but definitely not something I would go back for.  However, the combination layers of egg, chicken, gravy, and hash browns were delicious.    MTO's atmosphere is hip 20 year olds.  They have the music up really loud.    Overall, the food was decent, service was mediocre, and the atmosphere was too cool for me.",

The server immediately greeted us and took our order, so far so good.   The food come out in pieces, the last person's meal coming out about 10 minutes after the first. The server messed up on our order and brought us a breakfast wrap instead of breakfast tacos. When he brought the replacement tacos, not only did they have no meat but also no flavor. Out of the things we ordered the only items that were memorable were the MTO breakfast (that comes with 3 different meats!) and the Mac n cheese (SO GOOD).   The part of the experience that really ruined it for me was that after the server dropped off our food he never really came back. Getting our check was nearly impossible and we had to ask another server. My boyfriend asked two different servers for a coffee refill which he never got. When we got the check, the breakfast wrap was on it in addition to the tacos. Getting that fixed took another 10 minutes, and then getting it paid out was a different ordeal. Cute place, but service, ok food, but hey, cheap prices!",

I really don't have too much to say about this place, except that its okay....   One.. you do have to pay for parking. It's $2 if you have them validate your ticket for you.  Keep in mind this was on a Monday,  so I'm not sure if this is the cost for all days of the week.   Anyhow, we all decided to order the breakfast tacos. The Yelp picture got us lol. I ordered thr steak, and they ordered the chicken.  One of my friends traded one of my steaks, to try their chicken.  The tacos weren't bad,  but they weren't bomb either.  I've had better. We also tried the Elvis pancakes. I like most Elvis style anything, but these were way too chocolaty for us. My nephews had the French toast and chocolate pancake. They tore up the French toast,  but just like us adults,  my other nephew thought his chocolate pancakes had waaay too much chocolate on it.  A lot can also be a bad thing. But overall,  it wasn't bad, I just don't think we'll be coming back again.   Oh? But shout out to our waitress. Sorry I forgot her name. But she was super sweet. She took off the charge for my Bloody Mary, because I seriously wasn't feelin their style Bloody Mary. It's made with Soju instead.  Not a fan",

I was stuck between trying out the bacon pancake dipper and the Monte Cristo and I'm disappointed that I tried out the Monte Cristo because it lacked everything that made it so.   I mean they put such a light shake of powdered sugar that gave it the name of Monte Cristo and when I asked if they had any sort of jam or syrup because that's also something that usually goes along with the Monte Cristo. The  waitress handed me packaged smuckers jelly which was by far disappointing I felt at that point that I had just gone to an overpriced and overhyped Dennys  All I tasted was egg and cheese and very little ham this by far was one of the worst Monte Cristos I've had that it should even be called that.   Along with my boyfriends order he also disliked it so that's why I went for a 3 star  because a 3 is meant as just okay and that's what this place was. I'd say that this place isn't worth a second visit.",

The Ranch was I think buttermilk which is my favorite especially for those who love ranch. The server was so nice, she sat us in a booth which was perfect for me and my family because I have a toddler. The atmosphere was super chill. Their artwork was totally downtown vibes. My brother really enjoyed their Bloody Mary's which are bottomless only for $20 this is a great place to have brunch on a budget. Perfect place for a quick meal with family.",

Came here for the bottomless mimosas- aka the definition of a successful brunch. Me and my friends all got the mango mimosas. Yum! This is one of the few places in Vegas that offer bottomless mimosas during the week!  For food, I ordered the veggie hash with a side of extra crispy bacon. The veggie hash had just the right amount of potatoes, which paired great with the veggies and runny egg yolks. If I had to be picky, I had wished my bacon was just a little more crispy. Regardless, I finished all of it! I also had a couple bites of the vegan pancake with coconut & carrots. Next time I would order that just for myself! One thing I wish they served here is eggs Benedict. Other than that, I would no doubt come back to eat her  Our server Megan was awesome and always made sure our bottomless mimosas were never.... bottomless. Parking is validated for one hour if you park in the structure.",

You can pick up a menu and start perusing through the things you might want, you think you want and what your actually going to get. Once we got seated we really focused at the task at hand. BREAKFAST!   Of course you start your day with a cup of Coffee or Oj and I went for the Oj. Seeing that I had a drive ahead of me Coffee was not the best decisions. You coffee drinkers know what I mean.    Pancakes or eggs, pancakes or eggs! Went with a burger. A breakfast burger that is. What makes it a breakfast burger? Bacon and a runny egg. The hangover burger is an 8 oz. triple Angus patty with bacon, fried egg, cheddar, lettuce and special sauce. Burger patty was cooked medium so you still get that juice, tender patty at every bite. Bread was soft and fluffy and can't forget about the side of fries.  Egg & bacon breakfast sandwich that comes with two eggs, bacon and American cheese served on a Hawaiian bun. The wife added avocado to it. That added a creamy rich texture to the sandwich. Oh! And it comes with a side of mash browns or like I like to call them hash browns. All around good sandwich, well enough to put you in a food coma.   Now, can you have breakfast with out a side of fluffy golden pancakes. I think not! So we ordered a stack to share. Great pancake batter that made a awesome pancake. Drizzle a little syrup and boom! Deliciousness.   Want to get away from the Vegas strip to have a great meal then give this place a try. I'm sure you will enjoy it and if not well just walk a couple blocks to Fremont street and grab yourself a beer. Stay hungry my friends!",

Only thing is that it's one piece of bread with avocado and either an egg or a bacon on it. It was a little on the pricey side and now they even raised it $2.00. Not worth that price anymore. Bacon is super crispy.   We've ordered the breakfast sandwich with the potatoes on the side. Can make two meals out of it. Well the last time we ordered it only the sandwich got delivered and when we called in we were told that they no longer come with the potatoes. Mind you the menu has not been updated to reflect that and the price is still the same.   IMO this is no longer worth coming too. I understand raising prices but to raise it that much is just crazy and to change your menu but not updating it on line is just bad business practice",

    "text": "Great restaurant tucked into a parking structure. The raving reviews on Yelp attracted us to this location. It was a 5-10 minute walk from downtown Vegas hotels. My gf and I decided to walk over there.   Low-key, we regretted walking. We had free parking at Golden Nugget and the restaurant is located in a parking structure which offers validation. The walk was a little uncomfortable compared to the pampered life in La Jolla. We saw a handful of homeless people sleeping at 8:45a.   However, upon entering the restaurant, the atmosphere was a lot nicer. The host brought us in promptly and the service was top-notch. Never had to ask for refills and the our waitress visited us often.   I ordered the bodybuilder omelet which features egg white and sausages. As a drink, got a black coffee. My SO got avocado toast with a poached egg and bacon on top. The avocado toast was on point. Seasoning, taste, and freshness. However it is a little small in portion. They give you one slice of bread for ~$8-9. The omelet was exactly what I expected. The portion was better. Once again, the seasoning, taste, and freshness was obvious.   This is a great cafe to go to. But if you're a relatively bigger eater, careful about what you order.  All in all, you can expect a delicious meal and be treated as a valued guest here. Drive from the casinos to this location, won't regret it.   5 stars Pro: Great food, service, atmosphere Con: Portion",

The food - we came for brunch and wow was it amazing. I ordered the chicken and waffles. This strangely composed dish of fried chicken sandwiched between two perfectly cooked waffles with a dollop of bacon gravy sounds odd to many at first, but it delivers on flavour big time. The chicken was coated in an incredibly crunchy coating that was perfectly seasoned with juicy white chicken breast on the inside. I have had chicken and waffles before but this one was exceptional. My wife had the avocado skillet which is clearly not as exciting sounding as the C&W, but this also delivered on taste. Definitely was the \"healthier\" option of the two. We paired out brunch with some great Americanos.  Verdict - go for it! I think you'll be impressed.",

Maybe one day it will happen. Till then we just have to hurry to make it there before closing time.  There is a parking garage next door and the restaurant validates the ticket for one hour!  The place is always packed, so if you are in a hurry, maybe it's not the ideal to eat here.  We been seated quickly, but doesn't happen all the time. Also food doesn't come out fast either!  My daughter and I have been eating here occasionally, on and off, very randomly. The very first time, I remember that we got a free cookie with Yelp check in.   MTO Cafe has a variety of delicious and healthy food on their menu. Despite that, we chose more traditional things to eat, more like comfort food. My absolute favorite is the Lemon Poppyseeds pancake with blueberry-ginger compote. It's amazing! So flavorful, I could eat it every day! My daughter had Steak and eggs, and she loved it too.   Previously I had the Rueben with Fries. It's a great sandwich, very satisfying. Corned buffalo, Swiss cheese, special sauce, sauerkraut on a rye bread with french fries. You can substitute the fries for fruit cup for an additional charge.   There are also Vegan choices on the menu! Love the Strawberry Fields Salad (blue cheese, strawberries, red wine balsamic) My daughter also loves the Vegan Falafel (chickpeas, fava beans, tomato, lettuce, onion, balsamic tahini on unleaven bread and simple greens) Fruit Cups are fresh seasonal fruits.  They also have a Kids Menu for 12 and under!  So many healthy choices here! It's always an adventure to try new things.",

There is a parking structure, but there are a few free spaces for the cafe. But they do provide validation.",

Some of the \"vegan\" foods are questionably \"vegan\".  Make sure you ask ahead of time.",

    "text": "2 stars for good food and okay service:  However, they deductions for the following:  * When the manager asked us how we heard about their restaurant (it's completely off the beaten path of the tourist visiting Las Vegas and the Strip), I told him it was through <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FRestaurant.com&s=0aab4cbd731f3d3b0d1453050d3abc56a8c80bd214e25469c7555b750dca8a51\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Restaurant.com</a>.  I got the look of annoyance for using a gift certificate.  I just love it when businesses get annoyed at you as the customer for using a promotion that they are the ones that put out to the public.  \"Look!!  No one forced you to give a discount/promotion people!!\"  After that conversation, we never saw him again.  * We were told that we would have 2 hour validation in the parking structure attached to the restaurant.  Okay, cool...no need to rush, right??  Wrong!  Upon leaving the parking structure, we found it it was only 1 hour validated and we were over by 15 minutes.  Thus, we had to pay with those automated machines and they didn't accept our CC, but did accept DEBIT Card (contrary to what is stated on the machine itself).  * Weeks later, I received my credit card statement and noticed that MTO charged an additional $10.00 on my credit card.  I proceeded to contact my credit card company and disputed the charge.  Thank goodness for Discover!!    It was only after this last bullet point did I decide I have to write this review.  After going completely out of our way on our return trip back to Los Angeles, to eat at a restaurant for a pathetic $5.00 discount to use and have this restaurant experience...Lesson learned:  never go out of the way again!!",

With all the food choices, it was difficult to pick a place. I have heard many good things about MTO and decided to check it out for myself.   The atmosphere is open and industrial. Large tables are abundant and promote communal sitting. From the empty restaurant I saw when entering to the jammed pack area upon leaving, it is good that people don't mind sharing space. I sat outside and enjoyed the sunny day. Yes, it might have been 65 outside, but I was glad to have the peace and quiet. Once it starts to warm up, it will be a great place to sit and read.  The counter service is efficient. Once the order is placed, you just find a place to sit and they bring it out. The prices are really reasonable for the quality of food. I got the black and blue burger and was shocked by how well it was prepared. The blackberry sauce was fantastic against the blue cheese. I could not have been more happy with what I got. For $13 it was the most reasonable meal I could have got within the plaza.",

It was my last day in Vegas and I wanted some nice breakfast that wasn't going to be greasy and large just for the sake of it. Americans love their large portions. Anyway my yelp search brought me here. Actually I was heading to \"eat\" but all the roads were closed off and I didn't want to walk alone with my 19 month old amongst all the foul smelling homeless people so I had to yelp search again but I'm glad I did!  I shared the MTO breakfast with my son. OMG it was one of the best breakfasts I've had, full of protein and lots of YUM without feeling greasy and grossed out afterwards!! Three eggs, chicken sausage, FOUR pieces of bacon (I think two was Turkey had two normal), spam (I wasn't too keen on but hey I'm not American), tomatoes, cheesy hash, some berries and two thick pieces of toast. I wasn't keen on the bread only because I'm from Europe and I'm not a fan of American \"bread\". I wish I took a photo of it but as soon as it came my son was all over it so I missed my chance :( you really have to see it to appreciate how yummy the breakfast is. I love my chicken sausages and turkey bacon so it really was a perfect breakfast for me. Coffee was good too.   If you checkin on yelp, you get a free pastry. We got a free muffin and a small pastry as a substitute because we had to leave and the walnut toastie was still baking.   I saw some cool looking pancakes with grated carrot (?) on top and also bacon pancakes!! Which my husband would've really liked if he would've come with us. I'm sad we have to leave today, because I would've come back again tomorrow if we were still in Vegas.",

We had the Kentucky fried chicken, the Broccoli breakfast and the bacon pancake dippers.  I loved the Kentucky fried chicken!  I like the gravy they use and the hash mash, chicken and eggs go together so well.  I like how the pancakes for the bacon pancake dipper are thin.  I wasn't a big fan of the broccoli breakfast.  It was a little bland.  It's a healthier option, but I felt like it would benefit with more seasoning.  However, you have a choice to make it skillet, omelet or flatbread style.  The skillet style serves it with potatoes.",

The service this time was far from mediocre as I mentioned in my first review. We were treated great and even given a free parking validation slip by the hostess.  They offer a salad that is made different each week depending on what the local farmers market has. And they didn't mind giving me a side salad instead of fries with my burger.

Very cute and quaint little spot across from the Clark County courthouse. It's very hip and modern offering healthy dishes such as fresh pressed juices and vegan options.   I ordered the Pancake Dippers with peppercorn syrup (Yum!) I loved every bite. The bacon was a little tough to cut, but it's expected with a butter knife.   My boyfriend ordered the Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC) and it was phenomenal! I kept eating off of his plate! The chicken with the mashbrowns are a deadly combo. Yum. Yum. Yum.   Because we checked in on Yelp we received a free chocolate chip cookies & it was warm, soft, and heavenly.   It's a bit off of Freemont, but worth the 7 minute walk. I loved it. Highly recommend.   Our server Ryan was very kind and informative. All the staff were pleasant.",

It is located right in front of a parking garage.  Seemed to be the only parking there.  Ashley was our server.  I wanted the green drink, but I don't like celery.  The drink is premade so you can't customize it.  I ordered the Fat Elvis. Thick and goey French toast with Nutella, banana, and BACON in the middle, garnished with strawberries, blueberries, and blackberries. I think the bacon smothered in all that Nutella was the best part!  Very yummy!   Ashley was super attentive, I feel bad we were so busy chit chatting we probably stayed 20min too long.  They close at 2pm, I thought there were other customers, but upon leaving realized they all work there. Unfortunately they only validate $1.50 (1 hour) of your parking as well.",

My boyfriend got the steak and eggs which seemed fine but they did not deliver his toast until he was practically finished.

What's on their menu?  -Wraps, Omelets, Skillets -Pancakes and Waffles -Sandwiches and Burgers -Salads and Veggies -Desserts and Treats  I ended up playing it safe and got the MTO Breakfast for $14.00.  This came with 3 eggs, bacon, turkey bacon, chicken sausage, spam, mash browns, and your choice of bread.  I got mine with egg whites (additional $3 charge) and wheat.  So what's the verdict?  I got a satisfying, hearty breakfast, and at a great price.  Yes...you get a lot.  The egg whites were just your average fluffy egg whites, but everything else was well prepared and delicious.  I love their mash browns, which is a mix of mash potatoes and hash browns.  If you're a fan of both, then you'll love this hybrid. MTO's motto is \"fresh comfort food\".  Definitely fresh, definitely comfort food. There's so much that I still need to try and I can't wait for next time.  What's my plan?  Maybe a burger? Maybe their Chicken & Waffles?  Maybe a skillet? I guess I have to come back at least 2 more times to get my food on.  Peace Out!!",

This is a very modern and clean restaurant with great service. Now on to the food, I ordered the fried chicken and eggs breakfast. It comes as a plate of hashbrowns with a country gravy on top then topped with boneless fried chicken and your choice of eggs and priced at about $13.00.  The chicken was very bland with the exception of an overwhelming note of cinnamon. Hash browns were the same as any diner probably frozen shredded russets. The country gravy could not over power the cinnamon so I had to turn to standard table condiments of ketchup and copious amounts of Cholula hot sauce to finally unbind this pile to a consistency and moisture level that worked. If you're on the prowl for cheap eats, look elsewhere. If you like a very nice clean modern environment this may be worth a go.  With so many choices when I visit Vegas this will probably not be on my return list.",

Today I just order the tomato soup and when bill came was charged $7 for a cup of soup.  I asked waiter why it was same price as the combo and he said because it's ONLY sold as a combo.  Huh? Ok, no big deal, but wish he had told me this bit of info when I ordered. I guess I should've asked how much is JUST a cup of soup.    The manager came over and asked if everything was ok, so I mentioned how I really enjoyed the soup, but didn't realize if I ordered only soup I'd be charged for full combo.  She simply parroted the server and said we only sell soup as a combo with grilled cheese.    I get it! It's a COMBO!  Good deal for $7, super tasty, just don't; try ordering either item separately, or be prepared to pay for full cost of combo.  :-)",

The inside was clean well cooled and played great music! Our service was fast and super friendly and the food was absolutely delicious! I had the bacon pancake dippers, yum yum.",

This restaurant has a funky vibe and all the employees are friendly and seem to be enjoying their job.   I ordered the hen house wrap with a side of fruit. The oven roasted tomatoes were a nice change from just basic sliced tomatoes. There was a tad too much lettuce but overall the flavors worked well together. The fruit was better than most sides of fruit. Each piece of fruit actually tasted like the fruit and there was not one fruit such as pineapple overpowering all the other fruits.  The person I dined with ordered the queso carne without velveeta cheese. She said it needed a sauce and was expecting it to be thinly sliced instead of cubed meat. The sandwich was supposed to have drunken onions and there were literally three small pieces that blended in with the meat. The sandwich was tasteless until she asked for a side of the chipotle aioli.  I will be back because it's close to my house and all the food seems to be freshly prepared.",

Surely enough, it was amazing!!! Loved everything about it!!! Two thumbs up  We also ordered a chicken sausage scramble on a skillet and thought it was mediocre. It was definitely missing something in the scramble, I'm thinking cheese but they did have yummy tasting maple chicken sausages to make up for it. The potatoes (which I looked forward to) were soggy and seemingly undercooked for my liking. :(  They also gave us a sample plate of fried apple rings which were alright. Tasted like a apple doughnut but was lacking in the crisp. A bit mushy for my liking but still good.",

    "text": "Glancing at the menu I wasn't that excited. Breakfast items sounded typical and lunch items were slightly more intriguing. What drew me in was the name of the chef/partner, Johnny Church, who doubles as the chef at RM Seafood and Rx Boiler Room and previously worked at The View in Tivoli Village. The concept of elevated comfort food made from mostly locally sourced ingredients pays off in a big way. Dishes are expertly executed with passion and refinement that you won't find in most breakfast and lunch spots.  With a Yelp check-in we received complimentary walnut tossies. I've never heard the name before, but they're similar to tiny little tarts with a thick, buttery crust. That was followed up with an order of MTO mini donuts ($7). Firm in texture with a lightly crispy exterior, they arrived three per order covered in powdered sugar and honey.  My favorite dish was Chicken in a Waffle ($13). Tender chunks of breaded chicken smothered in a country gravy were sandwiched between light and crispy waffles and topped with fresh berries. The dish had everything you could want -- savory proteins accompanied by the sweetness of the fruit, the airiness of the waffles and the combination of tender, crispy, crunchy textures. The mound of skinny fries that came with it weren't bad either.  On a somewhat lighter and healthier side was the vegan carrot and coconut pancakes ($11). Don't let the vegan label scare you. The light and fluffy texture make them as good as most pancakes out there.  The biggest, and maybe the only, low point of the meal was the Fat Elvis ($13). It's French toast with banana, bacon, peanut butter, strawberries, and nutella. Sounds like a mouthful, right? It was and not in a good way. The peanut butter and nutella combo made it so dense and heavy that I could only stomach a few bites. Ok, maybe more than a few, but it was one dish i couldn't finish. And I almost always clean my plate.  Next up was one of the best grilled cheese ($11) sandwiches I've had containing brie, honey, and toasted walnuts between slices of brioche. And, finally rounding out the meal was their Thanksgiving burger ($14). An open-faced moist turkey patty sitting atop a bread pudding \"bun\", topped with an orange-cranberry sauce with a side of mashed browns. It was all delicious. Turkey burgers are usually gross, but I'd come back for seconds.  I was skeptical. The menu at first glance didn't sound inspiring. But, their ability to almost flawlessly elevate comfort food won me over. With a menu that is scheduled to change based on seasonal ingredients, there's plenty of reasons to return.",

Everything is made to order, the way it should be. They have a large selection of breakfast and lunch items, juice, and an espresso machine for fancy coffee drinks. After my first visit, a work breakfast, I immediately returned the following weekend with my husband in tow.   The lemon poppy seed pancakes are killer, I only wished that they had more blueberry compote. I also love their mashbrowns! Crispy on the outside and creamy like mashed potatoes on the inside. YUM! The MTO breakfast seems to jump off the page and land in front of every man I have ever dined with here, it's a huge hit. On the lunch side, the Hen House is essentially a Caesar salad in a wrap. It wasn't a show stopper for me, but decent. I've also tried the Queso Carne. The onions are delicious, again I just wished there were more of them. The Velveeta was surprisingly good, but it was overpowering, they really need to add a bit less to make it work. However, their fries are absolute skinny, crispy, perfection! I can't wait to try a few more things...and become a regular!",

Ordered the 'Broccoli' (broc, egg whites, spinach, Tillamook cheddar, jalapeno, mushrooms) in a whole wheat wrap ($12). Added a side of hash browns ($2) bc the accompanying side was two slices of tomato and a few pieces of lettuce. I always enjoy a salty break from an egg sammie (doesn't everyone?), but was turned off by the additional charge. Even more perplexing is that you can order it as a skillet (with potatoes) for the same price. Either way, that side of browns was phenomenal and almost got a second order sent my way. A crunchy outside, an almost creamy inside... oof. So good. Maybe I'll order 6 of those next time. The wrap itself was also very good. A great combo of veggies and cheese made each bite delish. The 'Chicken' (chicken sausage, roasted tomato, caramelized onions, arugula) was also good, but a bit heavy for my taste. If you're a sausage and onions kinda guy, look no further (OK, maybe look down further to the MTO Breakfast). Service? Ours was excellent.  Is the vibe cool? Yes! Do I want to come back here for lunch? Sure! Does paying $28 for 2 egg 'wiches and an iced tea (w/o potatoes) stink? Why yes, it does. Unfortunately, since it's not really located by anything else I frequent, I can't see myself being a regular here. However, a few times a month I'll def be hangin out. A large 2-steps up from a greasy spoon. 4-stars for now and I'll be back for more!  Protip: Check out their fb page for special Sunday night dinners with local chefs.

    "text": "My two children and I went here for lunch after a trip  To the Discovery Children's Museum.  I'm a Vegas native, and it's been fun to watch downtown start to come to life again in the past couple of years, so I was looking forward to trying MTO out.  We walked in, and the ambiance is very fresh, modern, open, and inviting.  Service was great too... Everyone was very attentive.  A nice plus too was that the kids each got a chocolate chip cookie for dessert for free.  Another plus was that this place has the best ranch dressing we've ever had.  Hands down.  Our family loves ranch dressing, and at MTO it's made from scratch and so delish!  Now to why I have given MTO three stars instead of five.  The menu was pretty limited.  Granted, the kitchen looked small, so that could be the reason.  The food was good, but not great.  Not something I would drive downtown to seek out.  The kids had the chicken finger kids meals.  I had the chicken sandwich.  I think it was called the Bob.  The sandwich was just okay.  The chicken was kind of dry.  And, there was a big smear of chocolate on my sandwich.  It was obvious that someone cut my sandwich in half with a knife used to also cut a dessert.  I do love chocolate, but this turned my stomach a bit.  I also think MTO is a tad bit overpriced for what you get.  For one sandwich, a water, and two kids meals it was $40 with a tip.  I just don't think the food quite justified the cost.  They do validate parking garage parking as well which is nice (pretty much your only option for parking), but when I left, I discovered that they only pay for one hour of parking.  So I was in the garage, digging for change or my credit card to pay the balance that I wasn't expecting, with cars waiting behind me.  Was MTO great?  No.  Was it bad?  No.  I don't think I'd seek it out again, but wouldn't be opposed to eating there either if I was with a group of people who wanted to try it out.",

Today we had the Kentucky Fried fried chicken all day breakfast, the MTO breakfast and the Yoga Pants breakfast, oh and the deep fried apples which were light and incredible. Well, I'm sure they have plenty of calories, but who's counting. The fried chicken was light and crispy, place on top of some mashed potatoes, topped off with an egg. Don't forget to add some avocado. This was cooked to perfection, and just the right portions. Our son had the MTO, which included three types of meat, spam, Chicken Sausage, turkey bacon, spam and bacon. mash browns and Sourdough toast. I chose this yesterday morning and honestly this was to much meat for me, but once again this was cooked to perfection. I have to say that this was the best sausage I've ever eaten. Our last selection was the Yoga skillet. This was made with diced vegetables with scrambled eggs. Egg whites are also an option with this choice. My GF had this for breakfast and couldn't finish it all. She also topped this off with sliced avocado. I can't say enough about all of our breakfast meals. Both times we were greeted by Donna, she was so pleasant and made us feel welcome. Both of our servers were so polite and attentive. We will certainly be back on our next trip. It was certainly worth the walk from our casino and a nice change from the normal casino buffet with the crowds to boot.",

I asked for hash browns instead of the russet potatoes and the chef didn't do it, so they just brought me a side of hash browns instead. Our food also took a ridiculous amount of time (30 minutes.)

Went to Yelp, found MTO, and did a take out order for breakfast. An outstanding latte, great coffee, Denver omelette, and some kind of chicken-y wrap. All excellent. Friendly service at the counter, too.  The next day was the capper, though. We stopped in around 11:30 a.m. on our way out of town. I had an absolutely superb sandwich EBLTA -- egg, bacon, lettuce, tomato, and avocado, for which I swapped out the bacon for chicken sausage. It was amazing. She had a turkey cheese avocado melt that was made from hand-carved turkey and reportedly delicioso, though I didn't taste it. That EBLTA was all I could handle.  Especially with the Trevor gift fries. And he didn't even know I was Yelp Elite 2017 (struggling mightily for a 2018 badge).",

The burger itself was delicious. Bacon was crispy, the house sauce was tasty and the fries weren't too oily/salty either, no regrets going with the burger (even though it was breakfast).   Also got to try a piece of the chicken & waffles which was fried nicely and the waffles were fluffy :)   Would've given the place 4/5 since the service was mediocre, but the food made it 5/5.

Catch an uber from the strip or get a 24 hr bus pass (machines in front of Planet Hollywood Las Vegas).",

The service was great and our waitress was exceptional. I started off with the MTO juice which I highly recommend. It was refreshing and not too sweet, definitely a good start to my day. I ordered the Yoga Pant omelet with avocado. It was perfect. Very filling but also light. My husband ordered the Kentucky breakfast which was fried chicken over a biscuit with gravy and hash browns. I snuck a taste and it was delicious! Lastly, we shared the lemon poppyseed pancake. Omg! You just get this! I was worried that it would be super sweet but it wasn't. It was awesome. Two thumbs up!",

We ordered two Bodybuilder omelettes and a steak(medium-rare) & eggs(over-medium) with hashbrowns. The hashbrowns had too much pepper in them, the steak was cooked well-done and was tough to chew through, the eggs were cooked over-easy and even after being sent back still weren't cooked over-medium. The omelettes themselves were great and their coffee was good too. But it's safe to say that the food overall wasn't as good as we had hoped. The pricing is pretty good for what you get. Over all I'd probably come back for the service and give the food another go, but if it isn't done right again we definitely won't be coming back a third time.",

They have several fresh juice options which are a great way to start the day. We had the green juice which hit the spot.  I had the avocado scramble and my wife had the broccoli scramble, both with hash browns instead of mash potatoes. Both were very tasty and hot, but nothing mind blowing, just very good. I recommend getting your scramble in a skillet as it will keep your food hot until you finish it.  Our waitress was cheery and fairly attentive. If the weather is agreeable out, they also have outdoor seating although it faces the street. I definitely recommend giving this place a try.",

    "text": "Lickety split pickup! I was staying downtown and didn't want the same ol' stuff you find everywhere, nor a buffet blah, so I fired up the app and found MTO. Just a few short blocks from downtown, it's a place that tourists can get to on foot if they want to leave the craziness, but it's great to see so many reviews from locals as well.  They seem to focus a lot on the brunch/breakfast aspect, and have a really great selection of simple lunches as well. Most people will talk about the breakfast and that seems to be their focus, but I was in desperate need of a salad after a heavy dinner the night before, and the light stroll with light fare was just what the doctor ordered.  Even though a cobb salad isn't exactly the lightest salad around, it was still perfect. Extremely generous portions of tomatoes, cucumbers, bacon, meat, and a hard-boiled egg. I polished it off completely, but really, you'll be able to share one. I also got a big bowl of fruit that seemed genuinely fresh. Strawberries, apple, blueberries; all in a cup. Your fruit may vary, depending on the season.  Most of all, though, I need to address that dressing. I'm in love with dill, and this dressing was packed with it. It was exquisitely dilled, and I couldn't get enough. I spread it over the salad (takeout comes with dressing on the side) and licked the little container clean. I haven't been this taken with a dressing in a long time, and I'll think it about it for a while after I'm back home.  Like I mentioned, I ordered the delivery right from the Yelp app. They also offered delivery, but I wanted some fresh air and it was a beautiful day. I'd love to come back from breakfast or brunch, as it seems they have a fresh twist on the classics. The space is light and beautiful, illuminated by the sun and nary a twinkling marquee light to be found.",

We were promptly sat and our server Kerry was very knowledgeable of the menu and taking her time introducing the popular food items.  The items we chose were the melt and KFC, both were delish and the coffee was exceptional. Great job MTO for putting focus on service and quality to a great product.

It was one of the best decisions (which are far and few in Vegas) that we made the entire trip.  The food was amazing, the bottomless mimosas were amazing, the service was amazing.  Ordering was tough because everything on the menu sounded like the best thing ever, but I went with the B.L.T.A.E. and it did not disappoint.  The ranch is also delicious, incase you also hail from the midwest and need a side of it with everything.  I would and will be recommending this place to anyone and everyone that tells me they're taking a trip to Vegas.",

I want to love it ( and give a better rating) but they need to work on management. Both times I've been we were advised the kitchen was backed up and indeed our food took time. I attempted to go a third time this weekend and despite several open tables, we were told the kitchen was backed up and to expect a 30 minute wait. For such a small seating area and small selection it seems a little crazy. Also, and I'm about to sound old, turn the music down just a little. Fix the kitchen, hire better servers and you might just have one of the better breakfast spots in town.",

    "text": "It's only fitting that my 100th review is for a place that I'll probably never forget going to.  My buddies and I were on a guy's trip to Vegas and we were staying on Fremont Street.  We were struggling out of bed looking forward to a low key day after hitting it hard the night before so we took a walk over to MTO Cafe for breakfast.  It seems like it's in the middle of nowhere but when we got there the place was pretty full.  Luckily the bar was empty so the 7 of us took over and lined up the entire bar.  That's when we noticed the deal...  $15 for all you can drink Mimosas and Bloody Marys.  Done and Done!  So we turned our low key day into a challenge to make our $15 worth its while and I would argue that we accomplished our goal.  In the meantime, I ordered an avocado omelet which blew my mind.    At one point during the meal, one of my friends challenged my other friend to chug a pitcher of mimosa for $40.  He accepted thinking the restaurant would never let him do it.  So the bartender went to ask the manager and his response was \"well I don't think it's legal to give him a pitcher, but we could serve it in 2-20oz glasses\".  Challenge accepted! My friend made it through one and a half glasses and won $20.  We proceeded to stay well past our welcome drinking more Mimosas and Bloody Marys and they somehow put up with us with a smile on their faces the entire time.  I would happily come back here the next time I'm in Vegas, which probably won't be too far away.",

The atmosphere, the ambience, the decor, the staff, the food, the pictures of food flashing on the screen to help aid your choices, just everything was lovely.  My waitress was very attentive, came by at just the right times to ask how everything was, and constantly filled up our water (they even filled my water up without me noticing!) I got the The Hero sandwich, my friend got the chicken in a waffle, and we shared the lemon poppy seed pancakes. Everything was great. I usually hate chicken and waffles (see Roscoes!) but this was so good. Light and fluffy, soft chicken that's not loaded with grease.  The pancakes were great too, and different. A little more lemon would have been appreciated but, lemon is my favorite flavor, so I'm a little biased.  The Hero was worth it, especially cause I'm a sandwich person. Would recommend, and am going back. Need to try so many other things.",

My wife had the High 5 Stack, very light and perfect pancakes. I had the Kentucky Fried Chicken and I have to tell you that this is Fantastic! Their Hash Browns are excellent and they top these with the best breaded chicken breast that I have had in a long time. Cover that with GRAVY and fried eggs, well I had to go back and have it again this morning.  Very friendly staff and great service. I met the owner today and he is just a warm, genuine and friendly person.  I can't wait to come back as I want to try a Fat Elvis, a Hangover Burger and I can't remember the name of the sandwich, but it has Spam and a Mornay sauce on a Brioche Bun! Wow!

Open seven days a week from breakfast till lunch and already a downtown darling with critics, city hall, and Zappos affiliates it was on a lazy Sunday that a friend and I sat down to a table in the airy, charming space just after 8:15 and with on-point service highly praiseful of both Chef Church and owner Ben Sabouri's vision much of what followed would prove well worth the hyperbole, a total of seven items and nearly as many cups of coffee comprising our 90 minute stay.  A menu broad in sections yet well-culled in scope it was with a wide swath that we cut through the options and requesting that items be sent out individually as the kitchen felt fit it was from sweet to savory that the morning progressed, an early offering of doughnuts that came off a touch oily and the doughy bread of the 'Fat Elvis' minor disappointments more than offset by fluffy vegan pancakes, creamy brie on lightly sweetened brioche, and superlative proteins such as the fried chicken smothered in bechamel or the tender turkey burger atop savory bread pudding alongside signature \"mashed browns,\" a crunchy/creamy juxtaposition of butter, brine, and starch.  Off to a good start and informed by our server that the new menu is scheduled to debut in just a few weeks I look forward to seeing how MTO evolves over time - early marketing tactics aside this is a spot with 'destination breakfast' potential and along with 'eat' already a reason for suburbanites and tourists to make their way downtown before dusk.",

The food is good, albeit a little high priced, but I think it is worth it. I have to say that the hangover burger was a tasty awesome mess of happy. Fried egg cooked just right with avocado on a perfectly spiced burger, just rocks.   The atmosphere is very modern and trendy, designed extremely well. They have a bar that usually has spots open to muscle up and order. The staff is also modern and trendy, and have good service.   My favorite thing is the coffee, it is really good and the cups are big. The price is not jacked up, either. With the price of the food where it is (lunch average $15-$20), you would expect $5+, but it's not, it's just a few bucks and they keep it coming.  I will keep coming back for sure. My love for downtown Vegas continues to grow because I am surprised with something new on a regular basis, MTO is one of the reasons for it.",

Prompt this delivery service it is, there is always something forgotten in the order i.e. Green drink, salad along with the chicken and waffles, a side mashbrowns, the list goes on.   Nevertheless, it's always a very tasty, somewhat healthy, way to remedy my hangover, or simply stay home on the weekends for brunch. The second location just opened at the new summerlin mall, I will likely check out this location as well.",

Visiting from out of town, our family of five brunched at MTO on Easter Sunday. They take reservations for large parties; I should have checked that in advance. So we had a bit of a wait, but it was totally worth it!  Portions are huge. We ordered 3 meals for the five of us (three teenagers and two parents). The Lemon Poppy Pancakes with the Blueberry Ginger sauce was amazing ($11)! My husband happily found a vegan, gluten-free carrot/coconut pancake option that was delicious ($11). My two teenage carnivores split a three-eggs, chicken sausage, sour dough toast meal ($14). (Again, the portions are huge!)   The diner coffee was delicious. They even had soy milk for the vegans. The fresh squeezed OJ was refreshing. Each beverage was $3.  I would definitely go again when in the area. Plenty of paid street parking nearby.",

We wound up getting the Avocado skillet and it was plenty for the two of us to share. It was delicious. Then we split an order of red velvet pancakes with chocolate sauce on top. I mean how can you pass that up. Once again it was incredible. I wish this place was back here in NJ I would go all the time.

    "text": "MTO (Made To Order) is an absolute amazing find in downtown Vegas. It is almost hidden near the City Govt Center under a parking structure (they do validate your parking for up to $1.50, just ask your server for a validation ticket when you leave), but well worth the search.  When you walk in you immediately feel the energy of the place. Its open layout and very comtempo vibe from the bright and warm accent colors and funky artwork to the made-by-the-owner furnishings, it is instantly inviting! We were immediately greeted and sat when we walked in the door and our waitress was at our table taking our drink order in no time flat. The easy to read menus have a eclectic selection of \"made to order\" items that are designed to feed your need for farm fresh, locally grown food or to nurse a hangover with something a bit more savory. Either way you are in for a treat!  I had the Red Juice, which was a fantastically healthy mix of beets, arugula, lime, carrot, red pepper, and pomegranate. It actually tasted delicious! To counteract my health conscious, I ordered some coffee (which is Grade A btw) and the Fat Elvis. This hunka-hunka pile of WTF-is-happening-in-my-mouthness is peanut butter, bananas, Nutella, AND bacon on legit french toast! To offset the insanely delicious gluttony, the dish is accompanied by a healthy heap of strawberries and blackberry garnish. I was definitely a fat, if not completely satisfied, Elvis (impersonator) when I was finally finished!  I had mentioned to our fantastic waitress that this place belonged in Austin as the vibe, decor, and menu just screamed Hyde Park, Rosedale, or SoCo and as luck would have it the very nice owner, Ben was sitting in a booth across from us. He graciously came over to say \"hi\" (he actually interacted with almost every single customer in the place) and we had a fantastic convo. Honestly, a great guy and his awesomeness definitely translates into this great restaurant. He had us try the fried apples (which literally hurt to eat I was so full, but man, it hurt soooo good!) which were also to-die-for delish!  I was so sad to have discovered this place as I was leaving Las Vegas (see what I did there?) because I would have eaten here for every meal for my three day-two night stay!   I guess I'll just have to wait til the next time I'm in downtown Vegas, or better yet until the grand opening of their new location in ATX!",

If you drive here they validate parking for up to an hour in the connected parking lot, you just have to ask.  Our server was strange a bit, but all smiles and super personable. I ordered the tomato soup and the turkey melt sandwich with fruit. Off the bat the sandwich comes with fries, but to upgrade to fresh cut fruit is 2 bucks, some people will probably complain about that. When I got the turkey melt it was seriously delicious. There was fresh avocado, melted pepper jack cheese, even the chipolte aoli was delicious and I normally hate sauce. It was really just the perfect sandwich. The fruit that came as the side was also really fresh and delicious as well. Would definitely recommend that sandwich!   I am sure you are wondering well Jen, if the place was so awesome why the 4 stars? Well kids, because the tomato soup and grilled cheese was not 5 star worthy. If I had stuck to just the turkey melt I probably would have given it 5 stars for that. We also tried the 'famous' apple rings, which were basically fresh apples in a coating and fried. They were good but for anyone watching their weight it is a nightmare!   Overall I really loved this place and may be back for another Turkey melt!",

I was also told that the skillets came with potato which is why I ordered the skillet rather than an omelet or scramble. The skillet was out of this world delicious, especially adding cholula to it. The fat Elvis was where it's at. So decadent and should be shared. I also took advantage of the free cookie with check in and it was a homemade chewy gooey chocolate chip kind. So full and happy!",

The sauces that came on the side were super good though. We ordered a special breakfast sandwich, it had two eggs, jack cheese, chipotle aioli, and I substituted ham and bacon instead of the sausage. It was good, but all the flavors were sweet so it ended up being a bit too rich for breakfast. I couldn't eat even half of it before I got a stomachache. The mashed hash browns were fabulous though. Overall a good breakfast place with nice service. Nothing to write home about though.",

    "text": "Not your typical Vegas joint!  After a night of poisoning my body with who knows what kind of alcohol. MTO was a pleasant surprise. We all wanted to have some yummy food and MTO fit the bill.   Still feeling the effects of a hangover I wanted some comfort food. Kentucky fried chicken with gravy, hash mash and eggs was the only thing that was going to cure this hangover. Damn that was good. Chicken breast was battered just right and juicy. Gravy was light but flavorful. Hash were crunchy and tasty. Eggs cooked perfectly over medium. I couldn't have asked for a better meal.   Now check this out. For those that eat chicken fried anything with gravy and all that stuff that taste so good but is bad for you. You know that this stuff is filling and weighs you down a bit. Almost to the point that you regret eating it. Well not here at MTO! Food was great, fresh and everyone at our table were stoked on their meals. I had some nibbles from the other plates and I would love to see MTO in my hometown of San Diego.   The slogan is \"Fresh comfort food\" and I have to agree.",

    "text": "This was my first time visiting here, and after reading tons of reviews of great this place was I was very excited to give this place a go.  The service itself was good, very personable staff, and someone who seemed like one of the owners or managers walked around and continually checked on all the diners. Something I really enjoy when I go out to eat. They were attentive making sure our water was refilled regularly, and we were finding everything ok.  My girlfriend and I ordered the \"Fat Elvis ($13)\" \"Triple Stack ($10)\" \"MTO Breakfast ($14)\" and a soy latte on the side.   Based on appearance the Fat Elvis looked the best like something you would expect to see, triple stack looked like your basic stack of pancakes, and the MTO Breakfast a larger version of the Grand Slam from Dennys.  I personally had the Fat Elvis, and it was great, bacon, bananas, nutella, peanut butter, sandwiched between french toast, and topped with fresh strawberries and powdered sugar, what is not to love. As far as the price goes though, I felt it was high for what you got, just that and no sides, which is the only reason we also got the MTO Breakfast to share.  The MTO Breakfast comes with three eggs any style, chicken sausage, turkey bacon, spam and bacon, choice of wheat, Wonder Bread, rye or sourdough, mash browns. Plated looked nothing like the site had advertised, didn't look very exciting to be honest. As far as taste it was just how it looked not exciting, and for the price not worth it at all. The turkey bacon definitely could have been cooked longer, chicken sausage was dry, ordered our eggs over medium and 1 of the yolks had already been busted before hitting our table. Not sure if we had to ask for our bread to be buttered but no butter, just the jam, and the spam were 2 different size cuts, one was more like a thin crispy spam chip, while the other was normal. The bacon was the best part about the dish.  The pancakes from what my girlfriend had to say was once again nothing special, and yet again for the price wasn't worth it. Could have went to iHop for the same thing.  I know I talked a lot about price, but I'm the type who doesn't mind spending money on food as long as it is worth it, and it wasn't worth it.  Maybe if we went with the other more popular dishes such as the Kentucky Fried Chicken, The Hangover Burger, or The Chicken in a Waffle. Our review would have came out different, but everything on the menu should taste delicious no matter how basic the meal is especially for how much they charge.  So, based on my first experience I doubt I would return if it was my choice. But if I do I will be sure to make a follow up review.",

On the weekends, it is $3 to park in the garage (EVERYWHERE around is pay for parking) and MTO validates- however, they only validate $1.50.  Well its not a lot of money, it is the principle of the matter to me.  I am going to a restaurant and spending money, why validate if you are only going to validate half?  So while the food, service and ambiance are all great- this little detail annoys me and will probably stop me from going back... unless they start validating the full $3 on the weekends.  Just doesn't make sense to me.",

Our order (1 yoga pants omelet, 1 yoga pants skillet, wheat toast) was served in just a few minutes. The eggs were fluffy and not overcooked, the vegetables were crisp and flavorful. On previous visits, we've had several other items on the menu and each was very tasty. The fried apple rings, basically small donuts with a big apple ring on the inside, are a nice treat. We left with a generous portion of leftovers and to-go cups of our drinks. This small, well-run cafe is a great place for a quality, quick meal served by a personable, attentive staff.",

The place is very clean and modern looking. I think the prices are very fair. Will definitely come here again. Looked at the lunch menu and decided I need to try it for lunch some time.

    "text": "I have mixed feelings about MTO.  The first time I came here with my husband and my Dad. I ordered a breakfast of 2 eggs over medium, bacon, and a side of toast. Also a coffee and orange juice. All of it came out just great. The eggs were cooked perfect, the bacon is great and the toast was great as well. My husband ordered the chicken and waffles and said it was also exceptional. My Dad ordered the \"Hangover\" burger and said that while it was really good, it was a little undercooked for his taste and he didn't like the sweet pickles on top. Overall, we were really excited to come back!  The second time we came here was disappointing.... I came here again with my Husband and my Brother in Law.  I ordered a Coffee, orange juice, and the mini donuts to share.  First of all the waitress forgot one of our coffees and water, no big deal it just took her a while. When I received my orange juice it had a *thick coarse black hair in it!* I told the waitress and decided I didn't want OJ after that. She barely said sorry...The mini donuts I received were more like mini dough cakes. They were very dense and not really donut like at all, they were smothered in honey and that didn't even help with the incredibly bland flavor, I dunked them in my coffee and that made them edible. Even tasty. Not sure if they come like this every time though, I would hope not.  My husband and I also split the Chicken and waffles, this time my hubby and I noted that while it was still pretty good, the gravy on the chicken was extremely bland this time around.  My Brother in Law ordered the Bacon Dippers and the Fried Apple rings. He said the Bacon Dippers were awesome. But the Fried Apple Rings were cut extremely thick, they were fried in batter but the apples were so thick they didn't really cook at all and the batter just fell off, he took one bite and didn't want the rest. Again, not sure if they are always cut SO thick. It's like eating a sliced apple...not what he was expecting.   Atmosphere is super nice here, it's so nice to sit by the window and have a nice view. The decorations are pretty cute and the place was very clean both times we came.   We decided we will still want to give this place another try, everyone has off days! But hopefully our experience will be more like the first time we came! If not, we probably won't be back.",

The Fat Elvis is delicious and the chefs/owners have a real commitment to creating excellent food   But...now that business has picked up, service has slowed down.. An hour is way too long to turn food around and get it on the table. If the food is going to take that long, please PLEASE get some carafes of mimosas! It shouldn't be a battle to partake in the unlimited mimosa on a Sunday morning, especially if you're paying for it. Just some constructive criticism to ensure the service continues to match the quality of the cafe.",

You can taste the time taken to make these foods. The sourdough bread was to die for. Also, I really like the shoe string fries the sandwiches come with.

Some unexpected items on the menu as well. \"Kentucky Fried Chicken\" looked great from the view I had of it on another table. Vegan Falafel is probably my favorite.  Warning though: this one doesn't travel well.  Tastes great in the restaurant but was pretty bad a few times we ordered it via Delivery.   They do a nice job of creating new tastes.  For example, adding honey to the grilled cheese, genius and delicious!  The atmosphere is also nice.  Up beat and fun but not too loud.  Oh, and bottomless mimosas.  Everyday.  $15.",

    "text": "What a great place. Location was great and parking was a breeze. MTO is attached to the city parking garage so looking for a spot isn't a problem. Also, the parking is cheap ($3 for our 2+ hour visit). But let's talk about the real stuff here....the food...  The menu isn't huge, but the variety is. While that might make you think the choices would be easy, they are not. EVERYTHING looked good. I ordered the bacon pancake dippers and my wife had the Skuna Bay salmon omelet. Both were out of this world. The omelets can all be ordered as wraps or skillets so the \"not huge\" menu will force you to make difficult choices (guess we will have to return). Oh, and the peppercorn syrup that came with the dippers was so unique that I wish they sold it so I could use it at home.  We were there with other friends and their choices were all delicious as well.   Here's a tip....if you are there in the morning and there is even the slightest chill in the air, sit at the rather large (14 person) community table with your back to the window and the sun beaming in on your back makes your comfort food meal that much more comfy. This will be my new brunch spot for sure.",

French toast layered with peanut butter, Nutella, banana  and crispy bacon  .. yes bacon  and topped with strawberries  , syrup and powdered sugar. Absolutely delicious. For lunch I recommend the \"hangover burger\" the juiciest fully loaded burger  with egg . Always cooked perfectly. Customer service is always great and friendly. They always recognize us and say welcome back guys. I love how they are very creative and always creating new things.... today they offered a blueberry ginger lemonade. Last time it was mango lemonade. They offer fresh healthy juices. I'm telling you this place is great . Fan for life",

They were closing in an hour when I got here so I want sure why the hostess was hesitant to give me a table where I can charge my phone that was out of juice. No group of more than 4 people showed up the entire time I was there and there were sure more empty tables than the one my appetite and I occupied. I didn't get service until somebody saw my Grumpy Cat look on. They were apologetic about it and they tried to overcompensate by telling me they have a new employee and everyone was checking up on me every 5 minutes when I just shoved food in my mouth.  I ordered a few items enough for 3 people. People who passed by stared at my food. One actually said, \"wow, that's a lot of food!\" I'm aware.  Green Juice: Apples, cucumber, lemon, zucchini, green pepper, celery and baby spinach. This was pretty good. If you don't mind the taste of celery, you'd love this. 3.5/5  Apple Rings: They look like doughnuts but it doesn't have a lot if dough at all. They're filled with apple rings drizzled with cinnamon glaze served piping hot. 5/5  Fat Elvis: Thick French toast with peanut butter, bacon, bananas and Nutella inside and dusted with powdered sugar, with berries on the side. You'll feel extremely fat after a few bites but it's delicious so, you'll end up with mixed emotions of guilt and happiness. 4/5  Broccoli: Egg white skillet with spinach, broccoli on top of potatoes. This was good but a bit oily. 4/5  I would say my experience was 3.5 stars. But they actually give back to the community. They help Childhood Cancer/ Leukemia so, I'll give the extra half a star for that.",

Came here with some friends on a saturday am after a LOOOONG night out to grab some comfort food to make up for the lack of sleep. Ordered the chicken waffle and pancakes to share. Both were nicely presented and was very tasty. I especially liked the freshly pressed antioxidant juices that we got, so yummy! We got each one of the red and green, highly recommend those.   The food is not very healthy especially the breakfast items, but they sure do absorb the excessive alcohol you put in your body the night before. Parking is validated in the parking structure behind the restaurant, or if you can find street meter parking. Bathrooms are clean. Service is decent.",

This place  is really cute, well decorated and full of light. Been here twice now and the food never disappoints! Bacon cooked inside my pancakes... You can't go wrong with anything bacon! I saw a guy eating the chicken INSIDE a waffle... It looked amazing, will definitely try that next time.   Ok, the most important part to me... The service. From the moment we were seated they make you feel like you are the only person in there. Amanda and Steve were our servers, I love sweet people! Amanda was just about the most adorable thing! Always making sure our drinks were full and making sure we didn't need anything. Steve was on point, made sure our food was perfect and we were happy.   So we wanted to let them know we enjoyed our food and especially the service, Donna, the new GM came by and chatted with us. She was so sweet and you can tell she really cares about the service in her place. Then they bring over a plate of Apple Rings to thank us for our feedback... Have you ever tried heaven on a plate? It was really nice of her and we devoured them.   It's a great place, great food and excellent service! Love it and will most definitely be back!",

Good thing we came a bit early because after we left, half the place was packed with people. Knowing how most American restaurants are, we only ordered 2 dishes for us and our 2 kids. It was enough to feed 5 people. We also got 2 fresh juices (a meal in itself) and the Deep Fried Apple Dessert. It was a lot of food.   Surprisingly, we still finished mostly everything on our plates. Next time we return to Las Vegas, this will be on our top list of places to come to for breakfast.",

I had the Kentucky fried chicken with mash browns and gravy. It was supposed to be their signature dish and it was fairly one note. The chicken was meh, not that crispy. We also had the chicken n waffles. Definitely had better in town unfortunately. In the end we were not that impressed with their most popular dishes so this will not be a repeat brunch place for us.

Unlike other cities, finding street parking for MTO (right next to City Hall in Downtown Vegas) was a breeze; and only $2 for 2 hours.  We entered to a very cute interior, think modern diner. Turns out that BF knew the manager, Mike, and he seated us and intro'd us to the menu and what's really good (which is truly EVERYTHING).   Considering it was just the two of us, we ordered quite a lot of things.  Green juice, latte, black ice tea, salmon skillet, tomato basil soup, the Hangover burger, side of (chicken apple) sausage, and complimentary apple donuts.  My salmon skillet was HUGE. I was not expecting it to be that big. Generous portions of lox on top cream cheese on a bed of fluffy dill scrambled eggs and potatoes. I don't normally eat scrambled egg but, this had to have been my favorite part of my meal.  The BF's tomato basil soup came with grilled cheese and he was pleasantly surprised because he still had the burger and fries coming. I thought the tomato basil soup and grilled cheese on texas toast was the best I've had...I think much better than Nordstrom's infamous soup/grilled cheese combo! The toast alone was delicious and tasted better when I ate it later in the day. The soup wasn't too sweet or basil tasting as others tend to be, which I loved!  THEN, the Hangover burger came out and it was deliciously huge, too. Who doesn't like it B.I.G.?!!! Fried egg on top of burgers can never go wrong. The bun(s) were toasted which added a little crunch to the burg. Fries were thin and not oily which is always amazing. It was, also, accompanied with buttered sandwich pickles, YUM.  Apple donuts were a pleasant surprise, too. Mainly cause I was expecting a donut type of dough with apple flavors but, it's actually an apple ring with dough and cinnamon & maple syrup around it. Reminds me of a mini apple pie =)  Overall, amazing experience and I'm surprised I was never here sooner. Excited to go back ASAP!!!!!",

The waffles are amazing as well! If you park in the parking garage the restaurant is attached to, the restaurant gives you $1.50 validation on your parking. If not, there's also street parking.  Highlight: bottomless mimosas for $20!!",

The parking situation is a bit rough like all downtown spots can be, but at least it's free street parking on Sundays.  There menu had a mix of tasty breakfast and lunch options. They also had some vegan and vegetarian friendly options which was nice for my vegetarian friend. I decided to go with the BLTAE, a BLT sandwich with added avocado, egg and a delicious pesto sauce. It was so good! The portion size was huge too, I had enough leftover for a take home box. I also opted for a mimosa too, $6 each or they offer $20 for bottomless.   My only reason for a 4 star rather than a 5 would be the slowness in service. I understood it was busy, but it wasn't too huge of a location for the time lags to be so long. Regardless I'd definitely come back here again. Great food and good vibes!",

They also have mimosas if you decide to do brunch with friends. I ordered a couple of entrees with friends for breakfast and they were all great. On a separate occasion, I ordered the chicken sandwich for lunch. The sandwich is what hooked me! It is so simple but oh so good.  Like I said, the food is excellent but if you decide to order takeout, there is a very big chance you will never get your order, or if you get it, it will be incorrect.  If the staff just took the time to double check the order it would have been a 5 star review from me. Customer service is what brings people back to an establishment. This is Las Vegas, there is great food everywhere.",

Got a nice seat near the window and ordered the steak and eggs. Sunny side up. When I got my eggs I reached for the salt and pepper and they were sticky!  That really grossed me out. I was first customer to sit there so you know it was like that from day before. One of my eggs had broken and the egg yolk was cooked completely. There was 4 people in the place, the chef should have been embarrassed to send that out. If you can't cook a sunny side up egg, go do something else. Steak was ok. Service was good, girl was friendly and efficient.  Coffee good and served in big mug.   Over all a disappointing visit.",

The server was on top of her stuff but she wasn't very friendly, like not really smiling or welcoming.

Presentation was on point, and serving size was generous. I was so happy! I ordered the yoga pants skillet and it was everything I wanted. Also got the vegan coconut carrot pancakes. Let me tell you about these PANCAKES! They were the most melt in your mouth made by Jesus pancakes I've ever tasted. My mom and sister were also happy with their selections! Plus you get a free cookie with yelp check in!",

Get these.) we're smashing and the lemon poppy seed pancakes were slap-your-mama good!   The loss of a star for me is because Lavazza coffee was served - which was kind of disappointing considering they're in the art district and there are so many great local roasters to support instead.",

Yes we went on a Sunday during Brunch hours on a holiday weekend, so we expected the wait to be seated. What we didn't expect was to wait another hour n 15 min to receive food after ordering. I guess the chefs were mixing up the order on checks too. To make things worse when we did receive food hash browns had black in them n tasted severely burnt. It was not edible. The egg sandwich after waiting all that time was supposed to be scrambled, but it still had some egg white not cooked in it. Yes they comped the meal but it was inedible. They offered to re cook n have it to go, n I agreed but the flavoring just wasn't there, sad to say. I threw it away n stopped at jack in the box on the way home. I hope they get it back together again, won't be going back for quite sometime, so beware who knows what is going to happen here. Felt bad for the waiter he was super n kept apologizing. So we did tip him.",

It came out quickly enough, but it took another 5-10 minutes for our waitress to bring the salad dressing that is supposed to go with it. I'm not sure why one would be served dry arugula with cooked quinoa in a restaurant, and no dressing, but here we are. After finally receiving the salad dressing, which is actually a spicy aioli, I was not really that pleased with the overall taste of everything all together. I mean... if an overpriced pile of greens that is on par with what you could buy in a grocery store deli case is your thing, then MTO is the place for you. After giving this spot several tries, I won't be back. The price point is too high for the quality and mediocre taste of the food.",

There are booth, tables, and bar seating with plenty of room to enjoy your meal without feeling cramped.  We went Friday around noon time and there was no wait in being seated. Upon coming, I've already looked at the menu and decided we'd get the BLTAE (?) and the \"KFC.\"   The food took longer than expected to be cooked and we waited a while. I realized that other people who were seated after us got their food first but it seems like they got the simple stuff (waffles, eggs and toast--stuff of the like). Our server, I believe her name was Rachel, made sure we were accommodated so I didn't feel neglected during the wait.  The food portion was good and filling. The chicken on the KFC was done perfectly! Their bacon was thick, non-greasy, and crunchy--very good!  I had an iced hazelnut latte--typical. We also had their juice of the day which was some kind of berry lemonade which was pretty interesting!   What I appreciate about this place is the ambiance and the thoughtful consideration in designing the place. Their seats had cushion and are very stylish! Makes for a very comfortable time.   In addition, I think we sat across Rod Stewart so that was pretty cool!   Overall a great experience with good food and great ambiance!  Don't forget to give your server your parking ticket so you can get a discount on parking. Paid $0.75 for parking after validation.",

Our waitress was really friendly and did a great job and making recommendations and refilling our drinks.  [FOOD] *Fried Apple Rings - Really tasty! Not too sweet, light, and fluffy!  *Chicken in a Waffle - Delicious! You get a nice piece of fried chicken, covered in gravy, topped with bacon, and served in between two waffles!  *Chorizo Skillet - Great for chorizo lovers! It had a really good flavor. The ratio of chorizo, egg and vegetables was perfect.  *Bacon Dippers - The way this was presented surprised us but basically looked like they made the pancakes with the strip of bacon in the middle. My friend enjoyed this dish and basically dipped his meal into a cup of syrup.  *Chocolate Chip Cookies - FREE with Yelp check-in! Score! Very tasty! They come out hot and fresh. The cookies were nice and soft. Great way to end the meal!  [PARKING] There's a parking garage next door. It's about $0.75 per half hour.

The special triple berry ginger juice (made into a mimosa...why not...we're in Vegas ) was light, refreshing and delicious.  $5.95  I was grateful to be able to get one pancake since I really only wanted just a taste...but of course I ate the whole thing!  The lemon flavor in the pancake and the hint of ginger in the berry compote was a party in my mouth! $3.75  Hearty avocado omlette.  Tasted fresh and was filling. $10.95  I am now enjoying the chocolate chip cookie (I got by checking in through yelp) while writing this review...which my spectacular server Lisa was kind enough to heat for me without me even asking.  If I lived here I'd definitely be back.   Definitely worth the short uber ride from the strip",

MTO has a menu that can satisfy all members of your party.  Their menu ranges from the traditional egg and toast, to waffles, burgers, pancakes, wraps, burgers, and ect.  With such an extensive menu, I have come to love two menu items which are: CHICKEN 'IN A WAFFLE' and the FRIED APPLE RINGS.  The Fried Apple Rings is large enough for two people to share easily!  The chicken 'in a waffle' is also very tasty, and filling.  This is one of my favorite brunch locations in Las Vegas.",

He stopped by probably 4-5 times to check on us and make sure we were all good.  Super nice young guy.  He made us The Hulk smoothie and a super soy milk steamer with vanilla.  Loved it!   My friend ordered the \"Body Builder\" omelet and raved about it.  It looked really chock full of fresh veggies!   I ordered the Vegan Carrot, Coconut, and Pecan pancakes.   YUM!  They were very good.  I was expecting the carrots and coconut to be inside the batter, but they are used for toppings.  They also had a Vegan Falafel wrap that sounded good too, but I did not try that (darn it).    Very nice ambiance, service, food presentation,and flavor.",

My favorites are the Vegan Carrot Pancakes, Curried Zucchini & Summer Squash Spaghetti (at the Summerlin location) with some added chicken, The Bob, The Hero and their farmers market veggies are awesome as well. I know that I'm a green person so their Green Juice is good too if you're into juices.  Check in on Yelp and get a free chocolate chip cookie which will hit the sweet tooth spot.   Other things I've tried are the Chicken \"in a Waffle\" - it's \"almost\" like any other chicken n' waffle dish, but here's the kicker, and I've never seen it come with this before, but this comes with a gravy sauce.  Thumbs up on the sauce. I've tried the Hen House wrap but I changed the Cesar dressing to the pecan Honey mustard sauce because I liked the sauce on the Bob sandwich so much.  But I think I should have kept the original sauce on there. It would have probably complemented the wrap better.  And the New England Clam Chowder was just okay for me. There's either something missing or there's just something different about it.  Well, HAPPY EATINGS! Until next time!",

I ordered the Avocado skillet. Fluffy eggs, pepper jack cheese, tomatillo sauce with slices of avocado on top of a bed of hash browns. Very filling! Portion was big! My gf ordered the poppyseed pancakes with blueberries and blueberry compote. Pancakes were hearty and tasty, the blueberry compote added a nice tart flavor.

We reviewed the menu and I was stuck in being healthy or eating happy! My sister as usual she got the Broccoli Skillet and added avocado! Very good and healthy, it came with eggwhites, spinach, broccoli, more greens and cheese! I got the harty MTO Breakfast! Which has a lot of protein! With chicken sausage, spam, two types of bacon and your choice of toast! Since I checked in I recieved a chocolate chip cookie, which was amazing!  The place its self looks amazing, I love the street art and other decoration! Best thing for me at least is that it feels clean and looks clean! Which is an A++ in my book! Great place for breakfast can't wait to come for lunch time! They also have validation for parking and I received tickets to the Foodie Fest Amazing made my dreams come True!

This was recommended by the folks who work at the market, and they told me they were buying a lot of their ingredients there, sooooo.... I finally got there, they had an etch a sketch for my 2 year old son to play with, and we ordered the bacon (excellent), the fries with gravy (very good), the hash browns (awesome!), an onion soup (tasted like it was made today, fantastic), and the caesar salad and strawberry fields salad with chicken. The Caesar was good, maybe not great. The Strawberry Fields salad was amazing, the arugula, the strawberries, the balsamic dressing! Magnifique!

Then the food seemed to take a long time before it came out. I started wondering if the favorable reviews are flukes.   In the end, I'm happy that I came.   Everything that others have stated about the food--higher price, but higher quality and portions, are entirely True. The menu is full of interesting, but not necessarily always healthier, twists to typical comfort food. I had the \"Kentucky Fried Chicken.\" Boy was it good! High quality meat, gravy goodness, egg on top. Winner!  The fresh juices were pretty good too.  We tried both between our threesome.  Open windows with grand views of City Hall--sexy Posh interior with available plugs to recharge in the booths--sexy $3 parking, even with $1.50 off validation--not sexy, but acceptable Great quality comfort food--awesome  Other than the parking cost, the only downer is that I feel like I need a nap after devouring my plate. Good thing I'm going shopping at the outlets nearby afterwards.   I will be back. Heck, I wish there was one of these near my neighborhood!",

I like how there is a mixture of a few tables, bar seating, booths for more privacy and a long, sleek high table table with bar stools along side their large window that over looks the street. If you need a place to relax and study, this would be it. You can grab one of their booths and set up your laptop and order some food to settle in. They provide power outlets for you to charge your electronics---something Starbucks needs to do.  Their ambiance is awesome! From their seating arrangement, lighting, art work display, to their kitchen and food presentation.  Their food is great!! They offer am array of options from the green eater to the extra grease lover. Their side orders are quite large, so be sure to share with two or three people, or, have that as your meal :) I would definitely return to this cafe.",

Yum! Also tried the chicken and waffles. The chicken had a crispy Cajun kick to it that made it delicious. It's served with a side of their country gravy. Our server was attentive and friendly, and the manager (perhaps owner) checked in on our table as well. There is ample seating and a casual, relaxed vibe. The hazelnut latte was great. And! They offer mimosas! Will return soon.",

The food, I had the MTO breakfast which had 4 different breakfast, toast, 3 eggs and those very good hash browns you're going to hear about. Everything was cooked perfectly. The chicken sausage was my favorite. My dining partner had the salmon burger. Two highlights - homemade pickles on top and they really treat that salmon filet nicely. Highly recommend. For dessert, we had the suggested fried apple slices. Seriously fresh and delish! High points for really happy and competent waitstaff. I recommend this place and I plan on returning.",

    "text": "Came on a Sunday around noon for breakfast after reading about this place and wanting to see if it would become one of our new favorite downtown spots. They were pretty busy when we got there and there was a 10 minute wait, but we were seated in about 5 minutes.  Our drink orders took a little longer than hoped to come, but that was fine. After some deliberation we decided to try the MTO breakfast and the lemon poppyseed pancakes. Our server, Ruby, may have just been having a bad day but the service continued to go downhill. We had to ask for silverware so we could stir our coffee. Another server brought the food out and it took her several minutes to even come by and ask us how it was. We asked for jam for the toast; she came by and forgot it, and when she brought it we asked if she had anything other than grape. by the time she let us know they only had grape jelly, we were done with our meal. She asked us if we wanted dessert, and as I said \"no thank you, I think we're ready for our check,\" she walked away. To me that is just rude. The rest of the staff seemed much friendlier and more attentive, but our particular service experience was sub-par.  Unfortunately, the food couldn't make up for the bad service. The turkey bacon was limp and had poor flavor. The fact that they only have Welch's grape jelly is kind of weird considering they offer 3 kinds of toast. The sourdough toast was really just warmed bread with a touch of butter, it wasn't very toasty. The bacon and sausage were fine but forgettable. The pancakes were good (not great) but the compote is poured on with none on the side, so at times the stack is exceedingly dry. Overall the portions were good for the price, but their signature breakfast combo is pretty lackluster and the flavors just didn't really come together.  If you're looking for a good breakfast downtown I'd recommend Eat instead.",

My colleague and I dropped in here on a not-so-busy lunch day and shared orders of the MTO Breakfast and Lemon Poppy Seed Pancakes.  MTO Breakfast: This three eggs prepped any style, mashbrowns, and your choice of meats and breads. When we saw Spam as an option, we requested they just make our order all spam with a side of scrambled eggs and sourdough bread. Personally, this would've tasted bomb with rice (can't help it, I'm Asian), but it was still tasty.   Lemon Poppy Seed Pancakes: Three pancakes with blueberry-ginger compote, which it could've used more of; however, that's a minor complaint. Overall, these flapjacks were perfectly fluffy and delish!  Service: Accommodating, attentive, and upbeat.   Overall: MTO's the spot to have breakfast for lunch on this side of town.",

Bread for patty melt is delicious and homemade tomatillo sauce was amazing.  Oh and pineapple/mint mimosas are the way to go.  Can't wait to come again.  Great location to the Smith Center if your looking for a brunch place before a matinee show.",

French Toast with Nutella.... bananas, strawberries, black berries.. both generous AND fabulous! T got the Farmhouse wrap.... so healthy, tasty, and delicious, love the thought of a Caesar dressing on it instead of the usual Ranch.  Nice touch. I had the Falafal Wrap... Great choice.  Very tasty AND they brought me extra Tzitzaki sauce for my pleasure!!  The whole staff bends over backward to make the dining experience friendly, fast, and fabulous. This place has that hipster / Portland feel to it so it's like traveling and never leaving home!  Great music, too. Thanks MTO for making the \"foodie\" in me happy!!",

All the girls that work there are in such bad moods the entire vibe is disgusting. Didn't want to give them our money so we left without saying anything.

He was right! Our meal was very filling yet delicious! The General Manager, Donna, later stopped by our table to see how we were enjoying our food.

That being said, it did take a while to get our food (again, it was busy). Probably 30 min. I had the blueberry poppyseed pancakes. They were good. I'd say above average, and certainly a big order.

It was obvious that they were bothering the majority of the people dining at that time. Our server only checked on us once, our salads were mediocre, my coworker actually left hers alone after only three bites (the server didn't even notice this or ask if there was anything wrong with it), and once he picked up our bill he went and sat down at a booth with a group of girls he was obviously friendly with instead of running our bill. The previously excited coworker vowed not to return, and although I was excited and had waited a while to try out MTO, I think I'm good on it now.

Check. Do you like freedom? Gottdamn muthafuckin check.   I can't even say how amazing the food is, but the bottomless mimosas flowing keep everything moving in the right direction. Sherolyn kept us going and was an awesome person. Tip your waitress 30%.",

It was decent, waffle was good, chicken was good but needed a little salt. The fries were also good and I tried the mango lemonade which was also good. My hubby had the hangover burger and he didn't enjoy it but he is really picky. Overall I would try this place again if I am in the area. It's connected to a parking garage which is good.",

Good service: The waitresses greet you very nicely and are very personable. When it's busy, the waitresses can be not so attentive at times. However, the manager is very active and keeps it flowing. On a separate occasion, the manager comped my table some mini-donuts.",

    "text": "We waited over an hour for our egg dishes. Our server kept going to check in the kitchen but we never saw her actually ask anyone about our orders. Finally, we told her to bring out whatever was ready and not to wait for all orders. She still waited. My huevos rancheros were sitting for a while before I got them so they weren't hot. I asked our server for sour cream and then watched her enter stuff into the computer and forget about my request. When she came back, I asked again for the sour cream and she said, \"we don't have sour cream\". Why didn't she tell me that the first time? Then she said, \"i thought you had asked for salsa\", which would have been a reasonable mistake if she had actually brought out salsa...So then, to make up for the disastrous breakfast, the manager discounted only 10%. Really? I would have expected a more reasonable resolution and for the manager to even come to our table to apologize for the wait. We watched our server talk to the manager and they seemed to be laughing and joking about what to do. So after the over an hour wait for EGGS, watching other people come and go, the terrible service, and the careless manager, the food was not worth the wait. Very disappointed with our overall experience.",

We stopped in for breakfast on the 4th of July so it was pretty quiet. It's near city hall so I imagine during the weekday non holiday it's preeteh busy.    I had the vegan pancakes which were good and my husband had an omelet. The food was good and the service was as well. Didn't take long for us to get our food and it was hot and fresh when it arrived. I loved how it had that downtown feel and loved how personable the staff was with everyone. I'd really like to go back and try more options on the menu, not that I have many but the hubby does. I am just happy to have this as a choice, it gives me a  downtown  casual type place to eat. Its these little spots in Vegas that keep this local feeling normal.",

They don't have a very extensive menu, but the dishes were very good.   For brunch, we had -   Chicken Sausage Skillet.  It was very good, very flavorful and it was a very good portion of food.  Fried Chicken w/ gravy, eggs and hash browns.  This was very very good. The chicken breast was so tender inside and perfectly crispy on the outside. The gravy was very tasty as well. It had a very distinctive nutmeg  flavor to it.   We also had some mimosas - a little more on the orange juice side, but they were cheap. And their bottomless prices are very cheap compared to other places in town.  I love to look around at what other people are eating and their hamburgers look delicious. So, I can't wait to go back and try more goodies :)",

Large enough that I couldn't completely finish, but good enough that I did anyways! The french fries are thin and crispy and so good. The service was fast and attentive.  The owners (I'm assuming) came and spoke to us and were personable.  Next time I visit Vegas, I'm coming back here to try another dish, it was that tasty.  Further from the strip than I'd like because I'm lazy, but really is worth the cab ride if you're visiting or the drive if not.   So Good!",
