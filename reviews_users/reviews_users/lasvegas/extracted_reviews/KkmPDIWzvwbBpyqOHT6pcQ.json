    "text": "Rao's has several dinning rooms in sort of a circular arrangement. Our dining experience was in the room adjacent to the Caesars Pool & Gardens. This room is bright as it has many windows . The other dining rooms are interior and do not have windows and a dark atmosphere. We arrived 10 minutes prior to our reservation time. The hostess checked us in, asked to be seated in the vestibule and stated that we would be seated at our reservation time. The dining room was not very busy and we were seated at a nice table adjacent to a window overlooking the pool and gardens.  Our server Matt was friendly and attentive. He was very familiar with the menu and provided  us with a description of the specials and some recommendations. Follow up though out was timely.  A starter was an order of baked  Little Neck Clams. Six clams topped with bread crumbs and oregano and served with a wedge of lemon. Overall they were very tasty but one was chewy.  The meatballs are listed as a side but the order of two is more than enough as an entree. The Meatballs are made with Ground Veal, Pork and Beef, Italian Breadcrumbs and Seasonings in a wonderful Marinara Sauce. The order of buttery mashed potatoes was also enough for two people. The OssoBuco, Braised Veal Shank  Veal Jus, Gremolatta, served over Saffron Risotto  is one of the best in town. The OssoBuco is a complete meal in itself, no other sides required.  Desert must wait for a return visit.",

The BF ordered off the regular menu, had the pork chops and the famous meatballs. I ordered from the special menu, I had the caprese salad, salmon, and tiramisu. BF loved his pork chop, finished it right up and loved the meatballs. I tried both and they were excellent. The caprese salad was very good and the salmon was good. The tiramisu was really good as well. The service was excellent and we would definitely return again when visiting Vegas again.",

I ordered the shrimp fra diavolo and it was good. Just that. Good. The shrimp was cooked well the slices of garlic were a nice touch but the tomato sauce tasted like Supermarket brand.   The bad: my boyfriend ordered the lasagna. There was easily over a pound and a half of sloppy, falling-apart lasagna on a plate. It was a mush. No defined layers no distinct sauces or cheeses just a mix of ingredients that resembled a scramble. It was terrible. He sent it right back to the kitchen and didn't even ask for a second dish.   The ugly: the waitress took the dish and left. She didn't care to try to make it right or send a manager to talk to us or anything. She gave us an attitude throughout the night and I rushed to eat my shrimps while my boyfriend sat there.   A restaurant of this magnitude and importance should not settle for mediocre service. Avoid this place at all cost. It is NOT worth it!",

In fact, I just told him that I'm writing this review and he said, \"How many stars are you giving them? Good. It's a crap restaurant.\"  Service was okay.  Here's our feedback on what we ordered: Calamari: Could have been the calamari at a $ restaurant in my opinion and we have calamari just about everywhere we go. Paying $$$ for it was silly. Beet salad: Fine House salad: Fine Eggplant parm: Terrible. It came out with a small dollop of marinara on top of it and definitely needed a lot more. And getting my hands on some while it still mattered proved difficult. Lamb chops: According to the boyfriend, \"Yeah, they were alright.\"  After building this place up in his mind and therefore vicariously in mine, we were very disappointed. No going back.",

We had a table of six and he only took drink orders from a few of us.  We waited too long after getting our menus to order.  We inquired about getting 3 separate checks and instead of explaining their policy of separating checks 4 equal ways, with a long face he complained about what a time consuming difficulty that would be for him.  Then asked if we still wanted separate checks.  I ordered filet mignon medium rare and fingerling potatoes.   My steak arrived well done and  I sent the steak back and the replacement came back rare, I didn't send it back again.  Also, it was not a filet mignon, it was tough and it was more likely a tenderloin.  The potatoes were very dry as though they were warmed leftovers, by then I was just done with the restaurant and the lack of attention from our waiter that I didn't bother sending those back.  The one bright spot was the meatball appetizer.  We won't be back after this experience.",

Reservations were a breeze to make and both times we were sat immediately.  The service is truly awesome.  Every person was attentive, friendly, and accommodating.  The menu is mostly traditional Italian with a few newer dishes added in for good measure.  The Caprese Salad is one of the freshest and tastiest I have ever eaten.  The eggplant parm was delicious.  However, the ravioli purses are definitely one of the most amazing entrees I have ever eaten.  The grilled veggies were a great accompaniment to the entrees.  The dessert menu (if you still have room for it!) is wonderful.  I highly suggest giving this restaurant a go.  You will not be disappointed.",

After 20 minutes we were asked if we wanted to eat in the bar despite the fact that the dining rooms were not that filled.  No thank you miss hostess, please seat us in a dining room. We were seated in the dining room facing the garden, very light and nicely decorated in a NY/Las Vegas Italian style. Based on fellow yelpers we ordered the beet salad which was very fresh, meatballs that were light and not overly seasoned, lemon chicken that was succulent and with a hint of lemon and dessert with cake and berries. Served family style so basically you share.  All really a great meal, will probably go back to try the other dishes.",

I was here for a business dinner and we got to try practically everything on the menu as part of this set menu, so please excuse the fact that I don't remember the names of everything I tried!  Course 1 : Salad - blah Calamari - perfect Caprese Salad - one of the best I've ever eaten. Their homemade mozzerella was to die for !   Course 2: Smoked salmon pasta: I'm a salmon person but this stuff reeked of salmon. Super fishy. Not very good.  Pasta with sausage: Sausage was very tasty. Pasta was undercooked. None of the pasta tasted homemade. Maybe it is but I'm a bad pasta taster.. but if it's homemade, they suck at making pasta.   Course 3:  Veal parmesan - My fiance's favorite dish of the evening. It was perfectly pounded, perfectly breaded and with just the right amount of cheese. Their red sauce is incredible.  Fresh fish of the day - seemed to be salmon again. This time it was well prepared and good. Nothing exciting here, just fish they didn't screw up.  Lemon chicken - Way too lemony for anyone at my table. This was served family style and 8 of us didn't even come close to finishing one order of it.   Course 4: Canoli - the nastiest canoli ever. Some of us were spitting them out (yes, at a business dinner - it was that gross). It tasted like medicine. NO idea WTF they put in this crap.  Fresh berries and cream - hard to screw that up.  Apple tart - DELISH. We were fighting over this.   The Rao's signature Cianti is also worth mentioning - quite good. We noticed meatballs weren't on the set menu and the server was kind enough to bring us some. These were the highlight of the evening! Best meatball I've ever eaten.. wow.   Overall it was good, but I don't get what the hype's about. The NY location must be much better to be as famous as this place is.",

    "text": "My wife and I had an excellent dinner here.  We walked in at 6:30 on a friday without a reservation and were able to get a seat.  The baked clams were very good.  My wife ordered the Chicken Scarpariello.  We were pre-warned that the chicken came on the bone which meant we would have to \"work for it\", which is a very nice way of making sure the dish doesn't come back for not being a chicken breast.  The dish was huge, and looked great, but was overpowered by the taste taste of the hot peppers, like someone had dumped a bottle of Gardinar juice on top of the whole thing.  My Osso bucco was amazing however and more than made up for her dish.  It was one of those dishes that was so good you are almost hesitant to order it again for fear that it wouldn't live up to the first time you had it.  I took one star off for the chicken dish and because our table was seated right next to the bar.  We were so close that we kept getting bumped into.  The table was also so small we were obliged send our bread dish away to make room for the main course.    Price wise this was a pretty good, $150 for app, two dinners, a drink and a half a bottle of wine.    Our server was very cordial and pleasant.  I had not problems leaving a 20% tip on the bill.",

    "text": "I find it very hard to believe that anyone gave this place less than 5 stars!  We went here for our anniversary dinner because my hubby read an article online about the original Rao's in New York City.  Apparently, at that location, reservations are nearly impossible to come by, it's constantly packed and they're doing so well they don't even bother to be open on the weekends . . . all this info I got second-hand from the hubs so if you find some of it a little exaggerated, my apologies! :)  About Rao's Las Vegas in Ceasar's Palace:  Service:  We had a reservation, arrived on time and they sat us right away.  Our waiter, Sean, showed up shortly after we were seated, was very friendly and explained the specials.  He was very honest about  what he liked and didn't care for as much on the menu and helped us make really good food choices. (which i will describe below!) When making the reservation, my husband had sent an email telling them it was our anniversary so everyone who came to our table wished us a happy anniversary and they even remembered the name of our daughter (who wasn't with us) which I guess the hubs had mentioned in his email! The waiter and other staff was very attentive to our needs  but there was really nothing extra that we needed b/c they took care of everything.   As a side note, the have a photographer there that goes around taking pics and tries to sell them to you after you're done eating.  We didn't buy them, but she did do a good job.   Oh, and I can't forget the owner, I guess his name is Rao and he is the son of the guy who originally started the restaurant.  He also knew it was our anniversary, and gave us two cookbooks that he had autographed for us.  He was a very sweet and humble guy ( unlike some chef/restaurant owners you meet).  Food:  OMG the food. It was ridiculous!  I am a huge italian food fan, particularly red sauces, and of course, the best I've ever had was in Florence, Italy. Since then, I have never been able to find a red sauce that good.  Rao's has it.   For an appetizer, we ordered the meatballs. You get two baseball-size meatballs, cooked to perfection and smothered in marinara sauce.  The meatballs were tender and flavorful all the way through and the sauce was smooth, silky, garlicky, basil-ly (which is not a word, but who cares). I'm  gonna dream about those meatballs. The recipe is in the cookbook we got so you better believe I'm gonna try my hand at making them at home . . . i think they use beef, italian sausage and veal. We also ordered the parmesan risotto balls, which were a special that night. They came with more marinara sauce, were nice and crispy on the outside, creamy in the middle and just yummy.  /but if you can only pick one appetizer, get the meatballs.  Wine: We ordered the chianti classico, which was delicious and went well with everything else we had.  Main courses: Like i said, i love red sauce so i was tempted to get the spaghetti bolognese. Our waiter, though, told us that although it was good, he recommended the spaghetti and meatballs more. Since id already had meatballs, i decided to go with the ravioli purses ....and I'm so glad i did. It was amazing. You get a plate of ravioli purses filled with ricotta cheese and barlett pears, topped with cranberries, sage leaves (which i think might have been seared in oil or something because they were crispy and delicious) and a brown butter sauce. Now, if you've ever had butter sauces, you know they can sometimes be overly greasy, this one was perfect. Not too oily and full of flavor. The hubs got the chicken scarpariello . . .for the life of me, I don't understand why anyone would go to an italian restaurant and not order pasta, but whatevs! LOL It was chicken, italian sausage and a variety of peppers in a white wine sauce. It was the mostly highly recommended (by our waiter) chicken dish on the menu. I didn't taste it myself but hubby said it was delicious but he admitted he liked my pasta better. ;)  Dessert: I was going to order the cannoli but the waiter said, \"may I make a suggestion?\" LOL yet again . . . so we ended up ordering the strawberry shortcake, which was my second choice anyway.  So glad we listened to our waiter again . . .the shortcake was actually an authentic style scone, slightly sweet, the strawberries were marinated, sweet, fresh and cold (but not frozen) the ice cream was perfect and it was topped with whipped cream.  So yummy! Oh, and they wrote Happy Anniversary around the rim of the bowl with chocolate sauce, which I thought was a nice touch.  I can't finish without mentioning the ambiance . . . It was so anti-Vegas and I loved it!! Old NYC style, pics of celebrities and random people on the walls, dark wood paneling and a cozy, comfortable yet upscale vibe. And even though its located inside Ceasar's Palace, the storefront and \"outdoor\" seating area look almost exactly like the original location in NYC. Very cool.  Overall, excellent experience and superb food!",

I had fantasies of trying to figure out a way to get in when I lived there - but never had the balls to go there and be rejected.  Fear not my little kittie-cats, Rao's is now available to the general public via Las Vegas!!!!  It was the only reservation I made prior to my weekend in Vegas, I wasn't sure about whether it would be crowded or not - but I was taking NO chances.  This is OLD school Italian food. I swear when you live in a city like SF these kinds of joints are becoming more and more difficult to find. - Just classic red sauce-y meat-y cheesy Italian food.  I know that the chicken scarpiello is supposed to be great here - but unfortunately I had made that very dish for Easter the weekend before - and we had been eating leftovers all week, so I was not in the mood (sadly).  I went with two food-loving girlfriends and we went family-style.  Night one we ordered: -Mozzarella en carozza - this is rarely found on menus outside of NY, and even then it is rare -Meatballs - a must! -Chicken Milanese - oh the crust was divine! (we asked, they said semolina flour, hmmmm...) -Fettuccini w cream peas and prosciutto -Peanut butter cream cheese pie thing - freaking amazing - get it, even if you might not finish it, but you will find a way...  We found ourselves with no plans on our last night - so went there (again). - Sunday night 2 of us split - and ate at the bar - the service was not so great - we were guessing the guy was new- everytime someone ordered a bottle or a glass of wine around us - he asked them to tell him the vin number -Chicken parmesan - very good - but I preferred the Milanese -(pasta) Begger purses with fried sage and cranberries, really good!  It is pricy - but I think every nice meal in Vegas is pricy. I would definitely go back.",

We arrived for our reservation at around 7 p.m. after donating a few bucks to the poker machines at the bar just outside of Rao's. Unfortunately, Lady Luck still eluded me.  When you arrive at Rao's, you will notice some tables outside. I guess these tables are for those who want to dine Al Fresco. Inside, there is a bar and 2 other rooms. There is a side room that is designated as the \"traditional\" Rao's and then there is a back room the looks out over the pool. Although, I am sure to have lunch here would be distracting with the pool. Just as a tip, I highly recommend that you ask to be sat in the back room.   The hostess seated us at a nice table in the back room. The room is large, but not overly noisy. For an appetizer, we ordered the Frito Misto. I have had Frito Misto at other places and it has been overly breaded. This was perfect! You are also served a basket of bread and a trio of butter. There is regular, pedestrian butter. Spicy red pepper butter. And the best of the best, the onion butter. Just a little piece of heaven for your bread. I could have licked the plate, but that wouldn't be classy.  For my main course, I had the pork chop. I nice portion of double cut goodness. It is served with sauteed with hot and sweet peppers that added a nice flavor to the pork chop. The other two people I was with had the linguine and clams. They both said it was really good. The wine list is pretty extensive. We had a white wine from Sardinia that was selected with the help of the Somelier, Rose. There is also a full bar for those of you who aren't wineos.  A few tips: Ask to be seated in the back room. Make a reservation. Valet parking at Cesars is $13.00.",

The restaurant was very empty (being we were the first ones there), which is fine with me. I can enjoy the wall to wall saturation of Pictures ranging from Rao's history to celebrity autographs. But , to no ones surprise, as I was leaving the restaurant had a nice buzz from the crowd.    We were greeted by friendly hostess who sat us right away and even helped us in our seats (I feel a little out of place receiving such treatment , but hey- when in Rome...). The waiter Howie, a phenomenal guy, took care of our table & was more than pleasant to deal with , very professional & knowledgable of the menu and of the Rao's name. Howie's service to the table was second to none.   The food....oh boy the food. Heaven on a plate. The bread - fresh & delish. Gotta have some olive oil to dip of course. If not they serve a trio of butter. Roasted red pepper butter, unsalted & smoked onion butter. The seafood salad was done with such delicate care. Not overcooked at all. Tender !!!! The Caesar salad comes with huge shaved pecorino slices & the dressing- amazing. The meatballs you ask? Get them, try them, eat them and enjoy. No if, ands or buts about it. The Osso Buco w/ Saffron Risotto....one of the best I've had in a long time. The Spaghetti Bolognese was the traditional hearty meat sauce. Spaghetti was al dente, which is the way it's supposed to be. Unfortunately we didn't do dessert- I didn't wanna over do it. Besides we had to make a show.   I have been dying to get into the Rao's in Manhattan and can never get the opportunity but once I made plans to come to Vegas- the first thing I did was make reservations for Rao's - and boy was it worth it.   BUON APPETITE!!!",

But she had a blond bun) we went there last night around 6:30pm sitting by the area with pictures of the owner shaking hands with Bill Clinton. She was very friendly and our waters were always filled up. When it reached the half mark of the glass, water was filled up right away. In addition, the bread basket was constantly refilled. You can tell that the employees are all about great service and making sure people are more than satisfied. I recommend getting the linguine and clams (for the first course) and the pork chops and chicken scapriello for your entree! Great experience and hopefully I'll be able to get into the NYC location, which is very rare and extremely hard to get a table for.",

We made it a point to dine here on our short visit in town. So I made reservations that morning for dinner in the evening on the phone with no problem. Once we arrived at Caesar's that night. We walked through the casino floor and past a few shops to get to the restaurant. Inside the hotel is a challenge to travel from here to there but the hotel staff are very helpful with directions if you get lost. The service at Rao's that night was exceptional. Our waitress Angela was amazing. Her wait staff were just as good. Never had a dirty plate, fork, etc. the whole dinner. Water glass always full. Asked Angela for some recommendations and she was spot on. She really knew her stuff and made us feel special. The food speaks for itself. Rao's have the best meatballs anywhere. No one does it better. There famous for it for good reason. If you come here. Start with that. You haven't lived until you have eaten the meatballs. I am serious. There isn't anything bad on the menu that I have tried. From the salads, to the pasta dishes, to the pork chops. Yum, yum and more yum. Dessert? I go with their classic cheese cake. Delicious. Rao's is my wife's and my favorite place to dine in Vegas. The service is top notch. The dining is classy, romantic, old school. The food is epically amazing. I wish I could give Rao's more stars. They deserve it. Bravo Rao's. My wife and I are your fans.",

It started perfectly for me when I checked in on the Yelp app and received an offer for a free New Yorker cocktail while waited for the rest of our party at the bar. We ordered the meatball appetizer, and crab carbonara and lamb chops for entrees. We received a special birthday plate with shareable desserts since there were 2 birthdays in our party - nice! Everything was great, but our server kinda checked out on us. He didn't offer wines, didn't check on us, and took a while for our checks. He was nice, but lacked that extra above & beyond oomph that you'd expect from a place like this.",

I'm sure the ambiance is completely different, but I'm told the food tastes pretty similar.  Speaking of the food- I theoretically don't like it when meat is super processed (I've never seen a meatball that cuts so cleanly) but those meatballs met their legendary deliciousness status.  And that lemon chicken was super tasty- it almost tasted like Brazilian grilled chicken but with a rich, Italian lemon wine sauce.   Going from a rich Italian meal to the clubs was a bit tough but totally worth it. I will be back, and until then, I'll think fondly of this experience as I eat my pasta with Raos marinara sauce from the comfort of my couch :)",

    "text": "I'd long wanted to try Rao's NY, but figured I'd try their Las Vegas outpost as scoring a reservation in NY is virtually impossible and I'd heard the food is the same at both locations.  While their meatballs lived up to their reputation, and their breads were good, everything else we had was okay at best. And \"okay\" is not good enough given the prices they charge.  While the interior decor was nice (don't sit on the patio or you'll miss half the allure of the place), the restaurant was very loud, and not in the fun way their NY outpost is supposed to be. It's just loud from other patrons and seems to lack sound-proofing.  If my visit to Rao's Las Vegas is any indication, their reputation is most likely based on the feel of their NY outpost, not on their food (other than their meatballs). If you go, consider going for appetizers only, getting their meatballs, breads, and wine (I didn't try their desserts so can't opine as to those).",

    "text": "Meh. I'll try not to be too long winded. We made reservations for 6 to eat here on New Years Day at 9pm. I was really excited because of the great reviews and I've tried their jar sauce before (only one I'll use) and figured it must be better in person. We showed up 20/30 minutes early and we're seated pretty quickly so that was good (we would have made earlier reservations but that's all Open Table had available).   After being seated the restaurant was busy but quickly cleared out after that with just a few tables remaining. We waited a few minutes for the waiter which was fine and ordered a round of drinks.   We ordered a couple of appetizers - meatballs and bruschetta. Meatballs were ok (I was expecting better) and bruschetta was good. The waiter explained that the portions for dinner are \"family style\" and we should order as such.   For entrees, I figured I would stick to the standard chicken Parmesan, and others ordered lemon chicken, shrimp and lobster fra diavolo, shrimp scampi, penne vodka and chicken parm substituted with a different sauce (two people were planning to share the family style portion of the last dish).   For being described as \"family style,\" the portions were very small. Chicken parm was just alright. The sauce in the jar tastes better than this sauce. Lobster and shrimp pasta was tasty, as well as, the shrimp scampi. The lemon chicken was tasty but our waiter didn't advise that it didn't come with any sides so that was pretty annoying. Oh, and the wine list is pretty nice and not that expensive.   The most annoying part is that before we even ordered our meal, we noticed a bunch of garbage all over the floor. We looked down and it looked like a ton of lentils? We told the waiter and he shrugged it off and said \"oh yeah I noticed that too. I don't know what it is.\" Really? Our meal was over $450 and that's the response we get about a dirty floor?   Was it awful? No. Would I go back? No way.",

That nights serving was over cooked and dry, devoid of taste even with the sauce and cheese.  Asked for a diablo sauce on the pasta.  It was spicy as expected, but so loaded with garlic it overwhelmed the dish. My wife had the Clams Linguini with red sauce and requested it to be made with very light garlic.  Same problem, so much garlic it was overwhelming.  Spent the night eating antacids.   Really hope it was a one-time problem, but not sure I want to go back again to find out, given the other choices at the Harrah's properties.",

Lemon chicken: this is my favorite and I think the best chicken i ever had in any restaurant regardless of price. You get the crunchy crispy outside contrasting with a tender juicy inside of both breast meat and thigh meat. Each order uses Half a chicken. Their chicken is bigger then a Cornish game hen but much smaller than a supermarket chicken. The small size allows for fast cooking to the inside to the bone without raw pink spots near the bone and still maintaining the crispy outside without burning. Almost impossible to replicate at home consistently. You have to control the grilling temperature with the size of the meat. The sauce is not sweet. Tangy. They don't use sugar as a short cut to carmelization. When served you can smell the vinegar evaporating. As the dish ages the tangy flavor changes to the subtle tartness of aging lemon. Very delicate. You have to experience this. The lemon chicken in the first minute is different than what it evolves to 10 minutes later. No fat. Not greasy. The big supermarket chickens are higher in cholesterol. Completely different texture and flavor",

The ambiance was a tad bit too dark, we enjoyed the pictures of famous people that have visited the restaurant over the years.   The food was overall terrible. We started with a Fritto Misto, which is a generous sized platter made up of fried calamari, shrimp, cod fish, and zucchini which was great until the middle & was extremely salty and had a fishy aftertaste; we returned it. The chef agreed that it was too salty and that they use rock salt. We then had a Cesar's Salad which was average. My boyfriend had the steak with a side if Pizzaiola that he was greatly disappointed with because it was mostly onion and is called Pizzaiola because it is supposed to more of a \"Pizza sauce\" with more tomato than anything and the steak also tasted too salty. I had the Penne Vodka which was actually the only dish I enjoyed. Unfortunately, my boyfriend was sick from all the salt we had from the Fritto Misto which we ate as an appetizer that he was not able to enjoy the rest of his food.   My bf was then was asked by a server if the he was enjoying his food and laughed at him after my bf said \"No and that he was feeling sick.\" I felt a little sick as well because of the overdose of salt and fishy aftertaste from the appetizer. What began as an exciting date with my boyfriend turned to being stuck in the bathroom all night.   One thing you can count on here though is that our waiter Brian was very friendly and on que with our dishes, allowing us enough time to eat each dish without feeling rushed. Hosts were quick to make sure wine was refilled and were quick to accommodate any requests.",

That would be kind of insulting. The menu is what it's supposed to be - a representation of Italian food in America in the 30s or 40s... Or whatever...  The problem I had was... Nothing was very good... The pastas were over cooked. The seasonings were weak. The service was friendly and fine, but didn't really stand out  I've never been to the flagship in NYC, but, I don't need to, to say that I was quite disappointed in my experience here.",

    "text": "Decent. But I don't think it was worth the price.  I ordered the Lemon Chicken. We put our order in at around 9:30, and the food came out only a few minutes after we had ordered.   I'm not sure how they cooked multiple different types of pasta, and chicken in under a few minutes so the food must be precooked and sitting under heat lamps.   The lemon chicken was pretty good. Lots of flavor and the chicken was cooked properly. Definitely recommend ordering a side with it. While the chicken is very filling a nice side will make it a complete meal. I really wish they put a small side of pasta included, it would have really made the meal much better especially for $30.   Overall, great service and pretty decent food.  If you're looking for a cheaper (but still really solid) option, there's a great Italian restaurant inside of the forum shops.",

    "text": "if i could give their bruschetta alone 5 stars i would. If i ever come back its for the bruschetta and bread basket. Came to rios on Thursday night 1/11/18. Ordered the chicken parm. Instead of spaghetti with marinara, i asked if i can have vodka sauce with my spaghetti. The waiter said yes but i will have to pay extra. OK no problem. I get my meal and i dig into the chicken first. I notice chunks of something in my spaghetti so i dont eat it and wait for the waiter to confirm theres no meat in the spaghetti. Once the waiter finally comes to the table to check on us (maybe 10-15 mins) after we got our plates, i asked him about the chunks. I thought it was probably onion. He tells me its meat. I spit out whatever is in my mouth and then he confirms its actually HAM!!! Ham in the vodka sauce. WTF??? I immediately lost my appetite. Eating pork is against my religion. And i do not eat any meat besides chicken. And i just ate my chicken that was touching it. He offered to get me another plate of pasta with no ham, i said no thank you, dinner was already over. He insisted on bringing a small bowl. I couldnt even eat it when he brought it though, completely lost my appetite. He then tells me next time to let them know of any dietary restrictions. Um ive never had to advise that i dont eat pork when i got out. Didnt think i needed to advise that when ordering spaghetti and chicken parm either. Only ate half of my piece of chicken and was still charged $48 for my meal and extra $$ for the sauce. Ridiculous. Not sure if ill even ever come back. The menu should say ham under the penne vodka dish. It did say Prosciutto Cotto, but how was i supposed to know thats ham??? thought it was a type of cheese. Cant believe they make vodka sauce with ham. So disappointed",

I've go to Vegas often and have walked by this place a few times and just wasn't sure if it would be good.  I hear that places aren't as good in Vegas that have other locations.  So last year I decided to give it a shot and was I surprised.  They really decorated this place to look like the NY location.  It's pretty big inside but it still has a small feel, which is cool.    At every Italian joint I hit I always have to try the meatballs and lasagna.   The meatballs were absolutely amazing.  The best that I have ever had actually.  I really enjoyed the sauce as well.  I make it a point to taste the sauce by itself and it was fantastic.  In Jacksonville they sell the sauce at a local grocery store so I'm pretty familiar with it.  The meatballs were large and were cooked and seasoned perfectly.  You put some parm cheese on it and it just melts in your mouth.    The lasagna is fantastic as well.  Amazing flavors and meaty as well.  The sauce just makes these dishes pop!",

Just went back and it was really disappointing. I'm Italian American and can really appreciate home style Italian cooking. I also like to taste a lot of different things and ordered a lot of food to try.  The baked clams were charred on top and the clams were over cooked. One even had that hint of fishiness you never want to taste or smell. We ordered Gnocchi  special as it was not on the menu. Gnocchi should melt in your mouth, these were rubbery. The lemon chicken, a speciality of the house, was dry.  1 sub par dish is a bad night. 3 is a restaurant past its prime.

The lemon chicken was a bit undercooked and not \"lemony\" enough.  Porkchop on the other hand I'd recommend.  The outside was grilled to a crispy crust, while the inside was perfectly medium.

    "text": "I go here nearly every time I'm in Vegas (a few times a year).  I just love it.  The food is good, not amazing, but always, always good.  And the service and ambiance are exactly perfect.  The food has always been quality, and I've never had something here I didn't like.  It's a perfect place for a nice dinner with one friend or a big corporate meal...either way, it works just right.    This last trip, I went there once with all my work peeps (9 of us total).  We all loved everything we got for appetizers and entrees and desserts.  The portions are ginormous.  The prices are high, but you really get a lot for what you pay for.  Just know: you will only finish about half of what you get.   The wine list is insane, with many bottles well over $500, $1000, and up.  This place definitely isn't a cheap place, but you gotta splurge sometimes, right???  I also went there a few times before dinners elsewhere for a dirty martini (I was staying at Caesar's).  The bartenders are all very old-school...and it really feels like you're in a mafia bar.  I do love it.  The dirty martinis are giant and come with blue-cheese stuffed olives, so they make me happy.  I also went my last night in town with a friend to sit at the bar and have an appetizer and a cocktail before heading out for the night.  Whether you're ordering a $300 dinner or a $30 snack, the staff still treats you the same way.  They're very polite and professional, but super friendly.  We both got martinis and ordered the Fritto Misto Deep Fried Calamari, Shrimp, Cod Fish and Julienne Zucchini with Remoulade and Marinara Sauce ($21).  Even though I've been there about 10 times and know that the portions are HUGE, I was shocked by how big this appetizer was.  It was the prettiest Fritto Misto I've ever seen (and I've seen many), as well as one of the best tasting ones I've ever eaten.  The zucchini was a nice little touch, too.  The shrimp were fantastic, the cod was flakey and good, but the calamari was the best part.  So, So, So good!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  We had just stopped in for a snack, but left feeling full!  And now it's a week later, and I'm still thinking about how delicious this was!  Some other favorites from the menu are the softball sized meatballs (sooo good!...but honestly, you can get one order to feed an entire table), the caprese salad (big wedges of tomatoes and buffalo mozzarella instead of thin slices of each), the pastas are all good (especially the shrimp fra diavola), but the real stars are the meat and veal entrees.  The parmesans and milaneses are so big they don't even really fit onto the plate, but gosh darn they taste delicious!  Can't wait for my next Vegas trip...where you'll definitely find me here at the bar and noshing on something delicious.",

My husband ordered Shrimp Risotto and it was creamy and delicious . Cannollis for dessert. Have eaten fab cannollis before in Philly but these were the best ever. Service was superb",

Friend here in vegas highly recommended EVERYTHING on the menu but we had to choose.  We started with the baked clams and they were divine. Great blend of cheese and italian herbs. Very well seasoned.  Our mains were the rigatoni with proccuito in a red sauce, (forgot dish name..this is next day) and the penne vodka.  Both of the extremely delicious.  I also ordered the side of meatballs since they are often talked about.  I have got to figure out the blend they use for those balls because they were amazing.  I don't understand some peoples bad experience here.   Yes the pasta is served al dente.  This is the best way to eat pasta, especially health wise. Look it up. Yes, this place is pricey but it is definitely worth it.  Though I was shocked that house merlot was $16 a glass, we enjoyed our last night in vegas.  Will return in a heartbeat when we visit again!!",

Our waiter happily replace the bread.   For appetizers we had the cocktail shrimp - descent, and the calamari - yum.. I was craving for it. Our meal too forever to come out, but for the main course, I had the clam linguine- average they prepared it kind of salty and I bit into several sand or tiny little rocks, dammit. otherwise I was satisfied. My hubby and friend had the salmon, it came out burnt and dry. It didn't look too good. There were definitely other yummy dishes that I might want to try later.",

    "text": "First off, the food here was excellent! The service was fast, friendly and very professional. So why only 4 stars? The price. Just because you are an \"upper scale\" restaurant doesn't mean your food is worth what you have on the menu.  We started off with a bread basket filled with various breads that I enjoyed with balsamic vinegar and oil for the dipping. My meal was shells with ricotta cheese. It was really good and I finished everything. All you got however was about 15 shells, sauce and cheese. That was $23! Maybe I am not wise to the ways of high end restaurants but the food portion and price just didn't add up for me. Maybe they fly their pasta in from Italy every day. If so I understand the price, but otherwise, come on.   I enjoyed the food, the atmosphere and the break from the typical Vegas buffet fare, just beware the price. Would I come back again. Maybe if I hit it big at the table games and had a few extra hundred to spare. Otherwise, I may try something else.",

    "text": "this will be a different type of review because it started off a little weird but ended up being better.  We went on Wednsday night for dinner, a group of 6 of us.  We showed up for our reservation and were seated right away.  The menu's came out along with water and the waiter came by asking us for drinks.  i ordered a Rum and Coke and his dickhead response was \"I'd imagine Bacardi is ok....\", i told him to surprise me even though i was a bit irritated.  He asked if we were getting appetizers to split and we said yes and picked up the \"Antipasto Della CASA\" which had amazing cheeses and meats, the \"Fritto Misto\" which was the best Calamari i ever tasted, and he suggested the famous Meatballs (which again, the best i ever had).  After the appetizer order, he took our menus which seemed a bit off but we didn't think much of it since we were having a good time.  After we ate the appetizers he came back over and asked if everything was good and if we needed anything else.  He was SHOCKED when we said we had been waiting to order more drinks and dinner.  His attitude completely changed and then he was all over our table being the nicest guy ever.    The food was really good, i got the \"Chicken Scarpariello\" which was amazing, but seemed a little small and mostly peppers in the bowl, i wish it had a bit more sausage.  The veal chop was amazing too, i'm glad i was able to try my friends.   Overall it turned into a good night was lots of food and drinks, i just wish the our waiter wouldn't have irked me the wrong way right off the bat!",

My meal was 5 stars, I enjoyed every moment of my stay.   The pasta? Made from a box, you can't fool me. I asked my waiter, he said we use De Cecco. There's no shame in that, some pasta snobs may hate on this place not using fresh pasta. Don't care.  My wife and I are seated in a lovely garden room. The bread comes out with 3 different types of butter.  I order wine and I tell my waiter, I have a show in less than 2 hours. I don't want to have a carb overload and crash during the performance. Not to worry, we'll make it all work.  While waiting my wife drops a bomb and says she doesn't want to order meatballs. WHAT?! I'm sweating until my waiter comes back, not to worry, you can order a single ball. Whew... The meatball comes out and it's amazing. The sauce, the soft tender meat, all working together to create harmonious love on my plate.   I wanted to try the bolognese sauce with pasta but my waiter dissuaded me, you're having meatballs which is the same taste, try the penne vodka sauce? Sold! We also ordered the Chicken Scarpariello dish. Rao's, like most Italian restaurants offer large plates that's meant to share. Who's better than us Italians? What's mine is yours!*  The penne (yeah yeah, boxed pasta) was something my mom would make. The sauce (not gravy! If you say gravy you're a track suit wearing guido from jersey) was perfecto!   And the Chicken Scarpariello was world class with sausage, two different peppers, onions and lemony white wine sauce. Man that's some nonna love right there!   Our waiter? Pulls up a chair to take our order! He was telling us, he was here when the place opened. \"Frankie No\" liked him so much he flew some wait staff to NYC to observe the operation. Now that's just world class folks. Rao's Vegas really has a great operation, the service and food were impeccable. If you're looking for some great NYC Italian food on your vacation, I highly recommend Rao's Las Vegas  *my cars are off limits. NOBODY drive the Corvette. Nobody...",

One of the first things one has to do to gauge a decent Italian restaurant, it's the sauce... or gravy. Second, the meatballs. So, we ordered the meatballs for an appetizer. They quickly served out two decently sized meatballs, covered in marinara. If you like creamy meatballs, these will probably be the best you've had. The assorted breads (including olive loaf) were perfect for scooping up some sauce.  For my entree, I decided to put them to the ultimate test... Ossobucco. And they delivered. First off, I love how they chose saffron risotto instead of pasta. Perfectly creamy with a mild saffron flavor; b-e-a-utifully done. The veal was perfectly braised, fork-tender; it was topped with marinara. This was by far, the best Italian food that I've had all year. The only thing lacking was the service. My drink sat empty for over 30-minutes, and even when he came to ask about dessert, I had to bring to his attention. Drinks must never run dry. It's a desert out there.",

    "text": "The food was ok, not great, but this a warning to folks. I picked a Drumhreller Cabernet from two wines on the menu, got the smaller pour, and paid 19 dollars for it. Was a decent wine. Looked it up when I got back to the room. A bottle of this wine costs $12! How obnoxious is that? Industry standard for by-the-glass wines is 25% of cost. Marking up a wine to this extent is just downright unethical. Shame on the folks who are hosing innocent customers like that.  I'd give them less than one star if I could. Find another place to eat.",

    "text": "We've lost that loving feeling. This was our third time dining at Rao's in Caesar's Palace and will be our last.  The visit before this one was sub-par, but we gave it another chance thinking we may have caught them on an off night. This time, we were a party of six. Thought we would treat family from out of town. The bad experience began at the hostess stand when we arrived for our reservation. We were greeted with indifference. The two young women at the hostess stand were borderline rude. Never-the-less, we were taken to a lovely round table that would have been perfect for conversation, however, we couldn't even talk to the person beside us because of the noise level. Probably the noisiest place we have ever eaten.  We all had different salads, they were all bland. I had to add lemon, oil and salt and pepper to doctor up my Caesar salad. The linguine and clam sauce, which I remembered being so good, was incredibly bland and tasteless. I asked for some red pepper flakes to sprinkle on and the server brought them over and decided to spoon them over my dish himself for some reason without asking, a full teaspoon! Who does that? The dish was inedible after that. He was a nice guy, but this was not a good move.  I tried my niece's chicken Piccata. It was dry and tough.  Probably the worst part is that this Italian restaurant does not have gluten free pasta. What? My daughter-in-law has celiac. What restaurant in today's world doesn't have gluten free pasta?? Especially one that specializes in PASTA. Unheard of. If you are looking for spaghetti and meatballs and good bread, I would recommend. No complaints there. And of course, their legendary marinara (that you can buy at your local supermarket) is still the best. Other than that, I'd definitely go to one of the other thousands of great restaurants in Vegas instead.",

    "text": "Loved the food, average service, extremely noisy.   We chose Rao's for our pre-show dinner at Caesars. The original restaurant in New York has only 12 tables and they have a recreation of that room in the Caesar's location which we asked to be seated in. We arrived just after 5:00 and seated in the \"New York room\".   Our server was right over to introduce herself and take drink orders. We ordered some wine and looked over the menu. They offer all of the Italian classics plus some of their own recipes like Uncle Vincents lemon chicken. We started off with the famous meatballs and split a caesar salad. We chose the veal parm and the lamb chops for our entrees which our server said was one of her favorite dishes.   The wine and bread came out quickly with the meatballs shortly after. The meatballs were excellent! Huge baseball size meatballs that were so moist I don't know how they didn't fall apart. Their marinara sauce on top was just perfect.   Now we waited, and waited for our salads. They didn't come out until 6:00 PM, 45 minutes after we ordered, or about 30-35 minutes after the meatballs. Our server never came over to check on us or apologize for the wait. Im not sure if she put them in late or the kitchen got backed up, but it was way too long. Once the salad finally came out we really enjoyed it. Plenty big to share for two. A very traditional caesar topped with large pieces of shaved parmesan.   The entrees arrived right after the salads as they should. The veal parm was huge, served bone-in and covered in melted cheese and marinara, an excellent choice. The lamp chops were three smaller sized chops cooked perfectly medium rare. They were served with potatoes and green beans. Although the potatoes were good, the green beans were boiled to death and lacked any seasoning.   For dessert we chose the peanut butter tart and the tiramisu. Both of the desserts were fantastic! Would order either of them again in a second. The tiramisu was super creamy, one of the best Ive had.   After about 5:30 the NY room was packed full and the noise level was extremely loud to the point you couldn't even carry on a conversation. I would not sit there again.   Our server wasn't unfriendly, but just didn't provide great service for this type of restaurant. This was a 3.5 star experience but I will up it to 4 because the food was so good.",

We made dinner reservations on a Wednesday.  We shared the meatball appetizer-- comes with two, perfect to share; very tender and delicious.  I got the lasagna and learned after the fact that it was recently on a Food Network show!  It was very good, but highly suggest you share it; it is very rich and hearty.  The prices are pretty steep for Italian food, but everything we ordered was well done.  The bread was fresh and soft.  And our waiter was great, very personable.  Highly recommend.",

The value of the outside area is that if you want to watch a sports event, you can see the screens at the bar right next to the restaurant.   I had the beet salad which was quite large and had lots of beets and greens with a dusting of goat cheese.  It was very tasty and I enjoyed it.  For my entree, I had the beef lasagne that has beef bolognese sauce and three cheeses.  It was very good and quite filling.  I couldn't finish it all.  The wines range from about 12-19 dollars a glass-similar to most prices in Vegas.  The service was excellent throughout my meal.  The one downside in eating on the outside portion was that there were quite a few smokers that stood by the rail.  It may not always be that way but something to consider.",

Special thank you to the owner for singing to our birthday girl, Jessica C, and offering up complimentary tray of desserts!  I like the ordering options here. You can order individually, or choose some dishes that are made for sharing. However, when I dine with friends all our food ends up being sharing!  Also it is a good place to pick for diners who like solely plant based food and/or meat.   Our dining experience happened after a show at the Palace, so we dined late. This may be a tip for late diners, some menu items may be out! Eeeeeekkkk... this happened to my friend, Mel K, but luckily she found another suitable option.  Our table sampled a variety of dishes:  -roasted beet salad -caesar salad -special of the day - salmon -grilled veggies -several of the pasta dishes -and not to forget the meats  I really enjoyed the roasted beet salad for the flavour and fresh ingredients. I also liked that my greens were not soaked in dressing =D  Caesar salad was good but nothing interesting to make it stand out. The salmon was terrific as well as the grilled veggies.  One con is the restroom situation. For the size of this restaurant and location within the Caesars Palace, there is a single stall bathroom for each male and females. This means for the ladies, a LOOOONNNNG line. Not a favourite when dining.  However, the bathroom was large and cozy for those \"private\" moments.",

I can usually can never finish my plate, but with this dish I licked it clean. It's so hard to look classy eating this dish.

We began with very good bread and butter, which for me was followed by an excellent House Salad that included radicchio, white cucumber, bright red tomato, lettuce consisting of fresh crisp mixed greens, Red Onions, and a very tasty light Italian vinaigrette.  Meanwhile, Diane devoured her gooey Mozzarella in Carrozza, which was just what a diner would want to receive for an appetizer of fried mozzarella.  For an entree I was presented with Spaghetti and Meatballs, or more correctly Spaghetti and Meatball.  But the quite large 6 oz. meatball--constructed of a mixture of beef, veal, and pork--truly delivered excellent flavor, along with the tasty Marinara Sauce that was generously ladled over it and al dente spaghetti.  Uncle Vincent's Famous Lemon Chicken was good, too, but the lemon flavor was strong, tart, and a bit overpowering for those not overly fond of lemon.  The Roasted Potatoes accompanying this dish were simply great.  The service staff was extremely friendly and helpful, except our busboy briefly fell down on the job by forgetting to replace removed silverware even after our entrees arrived.  Our helpful and extremely knowledgeable waitress stepped in to correct the error, and enable us to continue on a fine gustatory adventure.  For dessert, creamy Cheesecake was very satisfying accompanied by plump and juicy blueberries, although for Restaurant Week it was in rounded rather than classic form as a junior version of the classic V-shaped wedge.  And, Diane enjoyed her small Tiramisu.  It was a memorable meal, and I look forward to returning to Caesars Palace soon for another Rao's meatball fix and trying other attractive menu items here.",

Portion was very good and was served with large square slices of cheese. Romaine was crisp as were the croutons.  The Eggplant was served on an oval plate with about 6 rounds of thick Eggplant fried, covered with cheese and a minimal amount of red sauce, no side of pasta. I asked the Server and was told no pasta with the entree. Entree was minimal, Eggplant was not tender and I would guess it was prepped, frozen and reheated. I did not confirm that but I've had Eggplant Parmesan millions of times and this did not taste fresh and was below average with higher than average pricing.  Sorry to say this is a one and done.",

    "text": "Would have liked to go with 3.5, but can't do on Yelp.  I'll keep this a little briefer than some of my other Yelpers, but I will echo what a lot of people say:  Service: Good, but impersonal. I'm not a big fan of the 'fawning waitstaff' but I don't mind a little how-do-you-do, where you all from, etc. Nothing of that sort here. I also like a little feedback and input on food choices and while 'It's up to you' is a fine answer, just not the best one. Greeting at the front was nothing special; just the usual 'girl got the job because she's pretty' hosting style.   Food: As everyone says, the meatballs are fantastic. Everyone at the table enjoyed what they received and we got a variety. My veal I felt was a bit overdone but I inferred that 'well done' is their style. Portions of everything are large. We all ordered salads but could have easily ordered half and split them; no one finished their salads. Desserts were marvelous, again the table got a variety and all were gone.   Pricing: It's in a high-end hotel on the LV Strip, so expect a little bit of a bump. I would argue a little too big, but nothing to get excited about.   We had no issues with delivery times or with our table placement. Yes, it was a bit louder than I would like but again nothing to get excited about.   Reservations are a must. Give yourself a little extra time to get there as it is 'in the back'. Also, we were late as the front of Caesars gets crazy at that time and we didn't give ourselves enough time to get there.",

    "text": "My out of town buddy wanted Italian somewhere he hadn't been before.  He's a frequent visitor to Vegas so he has been to most of the good ones on the strip (thanks to me! ha!).  Throw in Restaurant Week and a lack of last minute tables available at 9pm on a Saturday and I was back at Rao's for the first time in 6 years.    I wanted to dine in the Christmas room again but there was a wait so we just opted for the lower floor area facing the pool.  We ordered a plate of antipasto (prosciutto di parma, mild sopresata, marinated artichokes, gaeta olives, buffalo mozzarella, tomatoes, grana padano, gorgonzola cheese, dressed arugula) to kick things off and that was very good.  Everything was fresh and that was a nice substitute instead of four people getting individual salads.  The osso bucco was literally calling my name right off the page but I figured I could come back for that any other time of the year.  I decided to take advantage of the great value of Restaurant Week and use the couple of bucks saved on drinking more wine.    The appetizer was \"Mozzarella in Carrozza\" which was described as fried fresh mozzarella sandwich served with marinara.  In reality it was 2 HUGE wedges of deep fried breaded mozzarella.  So unhealthy yet so delicious.  Fried cheese has never tasted bad...ever.  There were four options for the main course but since everyone else was getting pasta (scampi, spaghetti and meatballs, shells) I decided on the pork chop and MAN OH MAN was that a solid choice.  It was a double cut of pork that was pan seared and sauteed with hot and sweet cherry peppers.  It was juicy, spicy, well seasoned and I ended up gnawing on the bones at the end like a dog.    I took only one bite of the tiramisu since I was so full and my wife ate the rest of it.    There are so, so, so many Italian options around these days (and better values to be had) but I wouldn't mind splurging a little more for this gem a few times a year.",

To be completely honest, I'm also still upset about my teeny tiny escarole and bean soup that cost $15. Don't get me wrong: I get it. Restaurants are expensive and even moreso in Las Vegas but I have issues paying this much for traditional Italian-American cuisine. I'll stick to my local places in the future and skip this one.

I can verify that the customer service was top notch here.  Our server/bartender, whose name I forgot,  was excellent serving us.  He explained in detail and recommended us food and served it quick and fast, even assuring us that we wouldn't be late for our show.  Not only did he provide us with knowledge of the menu but he made us feel welcome and chatted about our trip.  A dinner is not only good food but excellent service.  My fiance raved about the steak they brought out and told me it was one of the best steaks he had.  I had a cheese pasta,  it was delicious.  They also give you complimentary bread and I think it was fried cheese.  The only thing I was disappointed about was not having enough time to actually enjoy my food since we were in a rush.

Little did we know what offense we had committed by being ever so slightly hungry ever so slightly too early.   We dropped by Rao's about a half hour before they opened and inquired as to when they were opening for the night. A rather friendly woman informed us that we would have to come back a bit later. Oh well... that's just fine, but right as we were leaving a waiter swept us up and no you don't have to leave. Take a seat and I'll get you a couple of menus. And right as we were about to sit down a lovely curve ball.   \"No you can't sit down... I was just messing with you.. leave!\" He started laughing at us and just walked away. This sort of behavior is simply inexcusable.   The Bottom line: This may have been one individual that should lose his job. I only went there once. Their food may be wonderful, but I will never eat there on future trips to Vegas and I hope this gives you pause before going there yourself.",

    "text": "I don't get to the New York area lately so I was eager to try this outpost of a renown New York Italian restaurant.  I had the veal parmigiana and it was great. A big piece of pounded veal, lightly breaded but still juicy. It was covered in san marzano tomatoes and generous amount of cheese. Even I could not finish it. The house wine was surprisingly good.  Reading some of the other reviews of this place, I am debating on how to deal with the pricing at this establishment. The pricing is high for Italian food but normal for what you pay at a restaurant for a meal in a better hotel in Las Vegas. And if it comes down to quality - that is definitely there.  Plus they turned away Madonna at the NY location - that's worth an extra star by itself.",

I got the lemon chicken and it was not a disappointment.  Quite good, really.    The reason I find it to be so-so it that there was really nothing special about it.  We went in, ate dinner off a typical menu, that was it.    Not an 'experience' which one would expect at Caesar's",

The dish had plenty of linguine but maybe a dozen real clams. The rest of the chopped clams came from a can. My husband had their famous $30 Lemon chicken. He liked it but he said the chicken had too many small bones in the pieces. Caesar salad was excellent. The verdict, we probably will never go back there.",

We found this place and they sat us within 15 minutes! With all the food we had and tried my fav was the Ceaser salad and the meatballs. The linguini was not very good. The penne was not cooked all the way. Someone got the ravioli purses which were good but really sweet. I couldnt see eating a whole bowl of that. I ate 2 and that was plenty. Overall the service was great. For 4 of us our bill was about $200 an that included a bottle of wine two beers and two long islands. They even gave us glasses to take our drinks to go! I wish more places at home in st Louis did that :-)",

My sister asked a few questions and the waiter appeared to be slightly bored as he answered her questions.  We had to ask for bread and olive oil as our overly dressed salads were delivered.  45 minutes later a different waiter appeared and asked if we would like coffee and dessert, HELLO- we never received our entrees.  We were told that our waiter had gone home lol!  This is getting worse by the minute.  Our clams arrived and 6 of 12 were not open, we also split a pasta dish which was so undercooked, al dente would be stretching it.  The worst service I have ever experienced, the food was terrible, and suffice it to say, the Rao's fiasco ruined a much awaited evening.",

Not everyone loved the maranara spaghetti. I ordered the quatro formaggio pizza and it was great. The white truffle oil they drizzled on top wasn't overpowering but just enough. Our party of 7 shared everything we ordered, and I think my pizza was the most tasty. Other things I liked were the prosciutto, sausage rosemary-crusted pizza and the cheese in the calzone. wow.  The Caesar's salad (lol) was pretty good, and the (housemade?) pickled anchovies on the side were so great (if you are a True fish lover).   Sometimes it is difficult to separate the food from the company, and what really gives a restaurant 4 stars? I had excellent company on a great vacation, but still, the food here stood out with fresh and quality ingredients. It was a lot of fun sitting on the padded park benches outside the place eating lunch with friends and family!",

We went for the famous meatballs so were a little surprised that they are only available as a side dish since my DH had his heart set on spaghetti and meatballs. Of course we had to order them as a side dish. we went with friends who use the Rao's meatball recipe at home and of course wanted to see if theirs measure up. Be warned that the meatballs can be a meal in themselves. You only get 2, but they are enormous! as a result we ordered too much food. Between us the DH and I got the spaghetti bolognese, the meatballs, and lamb chops. We would have been happy after the spaghetti and the meatballs. The lamb chops were absolutely delicious, but put me way past the point of being stuffed.   The bolognese was delicious, as were the meatballs. for wine we got a chianti classico which was just ok. It would be nice to see more affordable options on their wine list. Our service was very good and the prices weren't outrageous, especially for Vegas. After trying the meatballs I had to come home and look up the recipe, and it has now replaced our old standby meatball recipe. There are a lot of great restaurants in Vegas, but I wouldn't hesitate returning to Rao's.",

The insalata de frutti de mare is very nice, everything is very fresh and light, and the dressing was very good.  The gnocci bolognese was very good (probably top dish), and the meatballs were a very nice companion (not the best meatballs I've ever had, those would be Arturo's mama's at Amalfi in Indianapolis of all places, but still very tasty), and then the veal chop was also a very nice finish to the evening.  We also enjoyed a very nice and very reasonably priced bottle of Amarone to go with the meal.  Despite some of the other comments, service was very good, even though we were there on a Friday night and it was quite busy (is it never not busy here?).  All in all, a fun evening, and certainly easier than hassling \"Frankie No\" for a reservation for 6 months to eat in New York!",

    "text": "Do people even realize what Rao's is in New York?  I had to try Rao's in Las Vegas because the chances of me actually eating at the NY location is slim to none.  First of all, the Manhattan location doesn't accept reservations (calling their number is hilarious - basically a thank you for calling but go away message).  Secondly, I don't know any mobsters.  My chances of actually getting Regis Philbin to invite me is slim (though oddly enough, I think this is my only likely hope).  Lastly, I can't pony up enough $$ to actually buy myself a table there (one of 11 I think), that would be if one actually became free, which would never happen.  Then there are the logistics of eating at Rao's - since they are in the Hood, and you have to hire a car service to wait for you while you eat, or have someone drive your car and wait or something...     In short, Las Vegas will have to be a flimsy, Disney-fied, substitute to experiencing the real thing.  The first question I had was, how could they open such a large restaurant, with so many tables and translate the experience from New York to Vegas?  The answer - Since no one has actually eaten at the original, it doesn't matter.  The decor is upscale pizza joint like, red and white checkered tableclothes and lots of photos of celebrities who apparently have made it in to Rao's.  I ordered the stuffed zucchini blossoms that were stuffed with cheese and anchovies and deep fried.  It was salty and gooey goodness.  At any Italian restaurant, I like to order either a bolognese or a red sauce type pasta, as I think it's a barometer to how good it is.  So, I had the rigatoni with red sauce and pancetta.  I have to say, it was very good, but not out of this world exceptional.  The meatballs didn't disappoint - moist and tasty.    The service was very attentive - I think they imported some characters from New York to add charm.  It worked.  Overall, the atmosphere was an upscale but down home Italian American restaurant.  Here it seems like the recipes were handed down through generations, and there is lots of care taken to make solid dishes.  You won't find the food complicated by new fangled things like truffle oil and flavored foams.  I think it's exactly this which keeps Rao's in New York exclusive and packed every night with loyal diners, and they were successful in recreating (some of) the moment in Las Vegas.",

The only part I don't like is having to make a reservation months in advance....but it's worth it.  I love how they encourage you to split everything and then serve it in courses...Here are my recommendations:  Start with the Antipasto Platter - yummy poopoo platter of proscuitto, cheeses, roasted red peppers, olives...oh so good.  The roasted red peppers alone would be great too.  Then, share/sample the Pasta in Vodka sauce and the Meat Balls (huge savory moist meat).  They say they are famous for the Lemon Chicken...but we had the Veal.  If you do the above, stick with the Veal Chop with Cherry Peppers.   We did the Veal Chop and the Veal Parmesan (which is also fabulous - so much melted cheese it looks like a pizza)!  But the contrast of the veal chop to the pasta and meatball is really superb!  No room for dessert...but go win some money - you're in Vegas, baby!  Rao's - please open up a location in Los Angeles.",

My friend decided to go to Rao's since they had several options in their prix fixe menu compared to the other restaurants participating in this event.  So we made a reservation and was seated right away.  The restaurant was probably 3/4 full when we got in at 7:15pm.  The waiter did get our drinks and orders immediately.  I got a pear martini and it was good.  My friends got a Malibu and Pomegranate martini and they all enjoyed it.  All four of us ordered the prix fixe menu. We had baked clams topped with bread crumbs for the appetizer and it was good but just a tad salty.  The main entree took a little longer to arrive after the appetizer.  This was when the service started to suck. So we got our entrees and I got the ravioli with Bartlett pears and ricotta cheese topped with dried cranberries and basil.  It was pretty good.  You can taste the sweetness of the pear, tartness of the cranberries and saltiness of the Parmesan cheese.  I liked the favors all together.  My other friends got the pork chop with roasted vegetables and they both said that it was dry.  I believe one of them even mentioned that they wanted medium and both still came out dry.  So probably 15 minutes after we finished our entrees, that's when the waiter decided to show up and asked us if we wanted desserts.  I got the strawberry shortcake and it was disappointing. It was very ordinary and it tasted like it was not from a upper scale restaurant.  Some of my friends had tiramisu and I tasted it, it was just mediocre. I'm a dessert person and I always look forward to happy ending desserts.  After desserts, we probably waited 20 minutes to get our bill! Unbelievable.   I was expecting better service, food and decor since this restaurant is a Michelin starred restaurant.   Even though the food was mediocre, I still enjoyed my girl friends' company!",

She helped us choose a fantastic Chianti and she suggested we try the meatballs...I am SO GLAD she \"made\" us get them!    Everyone at our table ordered something different and we each loved our entrees.  We had two appetizers - bruschetta and caprese salad.  The bruschetta was unbelievable and the caprese salad was perfection.    The stars at this restaurant are truly the sauces and the meatballs.  The sauce I had on my angel hair pasta was marinara and was just out of this world.  The meatballs were fantastic and melt-in-your-mouth heaven!    We cannot wait to go back to Rao's the next time we are in Vegas!",

I'm an east coast Italian food snob, and this place blew me away. BAR NONE, the best meatballs I've ever had. The lasagna was ridiculous. Even the bread is awesome and they give you three different butters to try! We will definitely be back",

I would normally buy a steak, but tonight I decided to ask my awesome bartender Robert what he recommended on the menu.   He was very enthusiastic about the Grilled Lamb. Sold! Get me the Grilled Lamb. Medium.   A short wait later and my three Lamb Chops arrived. Amazing! I took one bite and had to thank Robert for his recommendation. They were very delicious on their own, no spices or sauces needed. A slightly sweet taste. 5 Stars.",

Every dish was al dente, perfectly seasoned, well-paired with the sauce.  I was amazed as I've been low carb and every dish required a second look.  We started with the Fritto Misto - Calamari, clams, string beans, and some other stuff and it was lightly breaded, well fried, and perfectly cooked and salted.  The traditional meatballs were perfectly sized, seasoned, and tasty.  Capreze salad was well placed with fragrant tomatoes and a hearty burrata cheese lightly touched with a basal and balsamic reduction.  Ravioli Purses were the hit of the night. Outside was al dente, Bartlett Pears and Ricotta Cheese were accentuated with brown sugar and cranberries.  It was a dessert course.  Vodka Penne and Sundried Tomato Chicken Penne were just perfectly cooked.  Bistecca was perfectly medium rare, tasty and a good end to the second course.  Super impressed by a restaurant in one of my least favorite casinos, Caesar's which is the Frankenstein of properties.",

Native NY'er (born and raised) + 1st gen American (parents from Italy).  OK.  Decor. Loved the feeling inside. Took me back to NYC (sadly now living in Lost Angeles). The feel was truly authentic.   Hated having to access it via the casino (the freaking smoke really does me in).  Food wise. It was OK. A person in my party has severe allergies and we do as we always do, alert the restaurant, then the waiter / waitress, and do what we can to ensure they can have something safe and edible.  The appetizers are brought to the table and the one for person with the allergy contains everything they are allergic to. The waiter says he didn't know which plate was not to have it on it (all of them!).  The meal itself was not good at all. The sauce was OK, but you can get that kind of sauce at Buco Di Beppo (where no self respecting Italian would eat).  The price for admission exceeded that of Sinatra, which is heads above in both food and service.  Will continue to purchase from Rao's online, but will not visit this restaurant again.",

    "text": "We have been going to this iconic Italian eatery for years and it has been one of our favorite places. However, with the recent passing of the patriarch of the Restaurant, Frank Pellegrino, the food, service & attention to detail are a thing of the past.  During our recent visit I ordered a Bloody Mary at the bar (while waiting 4 a table), it was made from a 6.5 oz can of mix with ice! Not home made, zero accoutrements I.E. salted glass, celery, olives. At $15 a pop, WTF?  At dinner we ordered the meatballs as an appetizer and what once was their signature dish was a disaster. The meatballs were burnt and didn't have the flavor we are accustomed to. What was really shocking was the tomato sauce, it was a dark burgundy and tasted like it was made days if not weeks in advance. WTF x2! Having had enough of the Bloody Mary, I switched to a bottled beer. Imagine my chagrin when it showed up already poured. Even a low-brow  eatery pours your beer in front of a patron. WTFx3! I sent it back and kindly requested they bring a new bottle with a cold glass and try again.  For the main course my guest ordered pasta, which was virtually uneatable due to the heretofore mentioned tainted tomato-sauce. My main course was the veal chop with the hot cherry peppers (my former favorite) which was way off the mark. The veal which in the past was a robust serving was tiny and unsatisfactory. WTF x 4! During this visit we also noticed tables that were not bused for over 20 minutes. Something is remiss with RAOS.  RIP Frankie, if RAOS doesn't get their act together they will be joining you sooner than later",

    "text": "Before my show last night, I had dinner at Rao's, something that had been on my radar for awhile.  I made a reservation for 5 PM so I had lots of time for a leisurely meal before the 7:30 show.  I was greeted promptly and taken to a table on the far side of the bar and down a few steps.  It's the last area before you go to their patio.  I had a view of the pool area and one of Caesars iconic Roman statues in a columned structure.  My server, Howard, quickly appeared and asked for my drink order.  He brought my iced tea quickly.  Having read about the size of Rao's portion, I was careful to choose wisely.  I went with the baked clams for an appetizer and the ravioli purses for the main course.  I was soon brought a nice bread basket.  Howard asked me if I wanted some balsamic with the olive oil and I declined.  I poured some of the oil onto the plate, salted it a bit, and then dipped some of the olive bread that was part of the basket.  Within a short time, my baked clams were delivered.  They are littleneck clams that had an oregano bread crumb topping.  I squeezed some lemon on the clams and dug in.  It's been a long time since I got baked clams and they were great!  The lemon mixed with the juices from the clams and I had another dipping \"sauce\" for my bread.  Very tasty!  The main course came. Rao's calls them beggar purse ravioli.  The ravioli were stuffed with a mixture of pear and ricotta cheese and they were in a sauce of brown butter seasoned with sage and topped with dried cranberries.  This caught my eye when I was reading the menu because it was such a different dish.  It was excellent, too!  The pear taste with the cheese was very mild and the butter with the dried cranberries was a True winner!  A good dish that's really different.  Also, I had dipping sauce #3--the brown butter with sage was a wonderful place to dip a few cubes of the good bread.  For dessert, I asked Howard for his advice.  He gave me a listing of the entire dessert menu without having to bring one to me.  Of the things on the menu, he recommended one, the peanut butter tart, something his wife makes--she's one of the pastry chefs at Rao's.  The tart had a graham cracker crust, a layer of chocolate ganache, and it was topped with peanut butter mousse.  It was superb!  I'll have the other dessert he recommended on my next visit.  The dinner was very very good!  Service was exemplary.  The staff or Howard was always around to refill water, get more iced tea, remove dirty dishes, and simply to do a great job!  I am a big fan of Rao's.",

The drinks (alcoholic) we ordered were flavoursome and strong enough, all food and courses were very well presented and all came out in good time and were delicious! We all shared a few plates, but personally, the meatballs are a MUST and the mozzarella starter is excellent too! Even The accompanying bread and red pepper butter was delicious. For dessert, we tried the chocolate peanut butter pie, the tiramisu and the creme brulee and portion sizes were very generous. All were tasty but the creme brulee was SO creamy and tasty.  SO impressed!",

    "text": "Apparently it's much easier to get a table at the Vegas location than the New York one (I haven't tried though) so my friend insisted that we come for dinner on night one in sin city. I'll say that my food was nothing special, but the service definitely was. Our server was joyful, helpful, and really made us feel at home. We all checked in for our free cocktail, and enjoyed the delicious bread while he broke down the menu and suggested what to go for. I can elaborate best on the eggplant parm that I got- order a side of pasta if you can because it's just eggplant with tomato sauce and cheese, almost no carbs (which I consider vital, and which actually may render you unable to finish the eggplant, but then again maybe if you're doing a high-fat low-carb thing may be unnecessary). The consensus was that it was nothing spectacular but a decent, Vegas-priced and Vegas-sized place to eat.",

Our party of 5, including my 7-year-old nephew, had reservations at Rao's early on a Saturday night. We were seated promptly in the back of the half-full restaurant. The wall nearest to us was full of pictures of famous athletes, most with some connection to New York. Oddly the bar seemed to be sporting Christmas decorations in the middle of March.   Our server was all business but courteous and efficient. He seemed to not be thrilled that we had a kid with us. On that note, there is no kid's menu but we knew that and plus my nephew was fine with a plate of plain pasta & sauce.  Portion sizes for the adults were decent. My sister and I made the mistake of ordering salads, which are large enough to be entrees by themselves. Between the salads and our actual entrees, we were too full to sample dessert.",

    "text": "This place has been bookmarked for the longest time, as I definitely love the Rao's sauce that you can get at the market.  Best sauce on the market, hands down.  So I decided to bite the bullet and have dinner here after the Elton John show, and made reservations at 9:45 (Elton lets out at 9:30).   The place closes at 10:00, so there were only a handful of patrons when we arrived.  No real small chat by the hostess, as in \"are we celebrating anything\"? (we were) or \"how's your evening\".  We were placed in the back facing the pool and bocce court.   Service was just ok.  No one described the 3 butters to us (so we eaves dropped on the next door table to hear what they were).  We started off with the \"famous\" meatballs as appetizers. When we were finished we had to wave down our server to complete our order, which we ended up splitting lasagna and peas.  She  messed up our lasagna order because she either forgot to enter it in or the kitchen forgot it, so we were served a bowl of peas and no entree. She apologized but meanwhile for 15-20 minutes we were eating peas, and bread.  As for the food, I wasn't blown away. Perhaps it didn't live up to the HYPE?  The meatballs were good but not orgasmic, especially for $17.  The lasagna was supposed to be \"huge\", but I could have eaten it by myself.  The big serving was the bowl of peas with prosciutto, and I thought that was the best of the 3 items.    The saving grace is I got to use my Total Reward points to pay for this meal. I did tip the server 25% since she had to stay late, and she did chat us up at the end. Otherwise, had it not been a \"free\" meal,  she would have gotten a smaller tip.  I must have missed the 5 star memo.  Too bad.",

We went last Sunday for my first time and a celebratory night out. Ordered the meatballs and veal parmesan and my grandfather ordered one as well. Our total with a glass of house wine and bottled blue moon was $169.95.  It was the worst and most expensive Italian meal I've ever had.   Not sure if the chef wasn't in or someone was replacing them but holy shit it was almost completely inedible.  The meatballs themselves were fine but the sauce was so incredibly acidic it tasted like stomach bile after vomiting.  The veal was so tough I had to saw through it with a steak knife, trying to chew it was like rubber. For $53 that thing should have fallen apart it if I looked at it wrong, never had veal that tough in my life.  Maybe it was a off night or maybe I just had bad luck? Not really sure what happened but it was a shame since I had high hopes after hearing all the stories and legends about Rao's.",

When myself and a co-worker arrived at at 4:59 (told over the phone if we were late or no showed, they would charge our card $50) there was no one at the hostess stand to greet us.  Had to wander to the bar to announce our arrival ---- only to find that the 2 young ladies sitting with the 2 older men RIGHT NEXT TO THE HOSTESS STAND were actually the hostesses who should have greeted and seated us.  Owners, if you are reading this, NOT THE WAY TO START A MEAL FOR 2 FOR OVER $150 - work it out.  Stay off TV and fix this.  I can't overlook this, hire better.  Unless you can back it up at the end, start strong.  Once seated our waiter was knowledgeable and reasonably accommodating but we felt so rushed.  Everything we ordered arrived within 5 minutes...just as quickly we were asked if they could take FULL plates.  NO - go away.  The waiter also sat on chairs that were weirdly blocking access to our booth - I expect Hooters waitresses to sit at my table, not Rao's waiters.  Started with the antipasta appetizer for 2 - amazing,  Also ordered the Meatball side dish, they were fine, I truly make better, I also serve mine hot.  The Pasta with Vodka sauce was simply amazing.  Also had an order of the Fussilli with spicy sausage and cabbage - the pasta was perfect, the cabbage was a good addition - the sausage was over cooked, just short of burned, the sauce was acceptable, bordering on too acidic.  When leaving, I was put off that the only res was at 5:00, we felt rushed and left at 7:00 to an almost empty restaurant.  Should I ever have the option to try the Harlem version, I would be hard pressed to say yes, sorry.  Work is needed.",

    "text": "Rao's is in a fairly nice location in Caesar's Palace--it's located in between casinos, and it has indoor (inside the restaurant), and \"outdoor\" (overlooking the walkways between casinos) seating.  We were looking for a quick place to have lunch, and this place was right in our way.  The waitstaff was very nice and very polite to us.  Water was regularly refilled, and freebees were ample, like bread and olive oil.  The table and linens were clean.  There was a very limited selection of wine--a definite no-no in the world of Italian dining.  Both wine and beer are overpriced, but that is part of being in Las Vegas.    Pizzas were about 8 to 10 inches--all were personal pizzas.  The size wasn't so much the issue as was how they were dressed.  In other restaurants, their pizzas would have been classified as appetizers rather than entrees.    My biggest complaint has to do with the meatball entree.  For lunch, this included 1 large meatball, but it didn't come with anything at all--no pasta, no salad, no bread, nothing.  WHO orders a meatball and NOTHING ELSE?  What was worse was the sneaky way the server tacked on what was less than a half-order of pasta to make it a meal...for an extra $13!  I actually don't think the meatball may have cost that much.  In a place like Las Vegas, famous for gourmet all-you-can-eat buffets, Rao's is NOT WORTH YOUR TIME.  Small portions, service that deliberately did not disclose information about the menu, and a much larger than warranted bill at the end of the experience was enough to keep me searching for a better deal and better food.",

    "text": "OK as an ex NJ / NY guy dining in Rao's in Manhattan that simply is not a privilege the regular guy will ever get to experience. Having been invited once about 10 years ago, I truly can state back then I wasn't quite sure if I was in a great restaurant with great food, or If all the hype skewed my judgment as coming away from that experience As Teddy KGB said in Rounder's, like a teenager coming in for a quickie, I feel so unsatisfied.    Now some 10 years later the Las Vegas venue obviously not the same chefs, ingredients etc, were on our horizon this past Super Bowl weekend as 4 of us headed to the Forum shops of Ceases to give this location a whirl. 3 of us to dine for dinner tonight and Saturday night Super Bowl weekend the place is crowded but not packed to the rafters. Greeted by a very nice Italian looking gentlemen who was as pleasant as can be. (More on this later).  Seated in the lower area courtyard facing the windows to the pool, its dark out so not much to see. Well as things go I sit down on what can only be described on a soaking wet back half of the chair and I'm drenched. Here I am in a $300.00 shirt and expensive slacks that are soaked. Not even an apology from the waiters, host, mgr, nothing. They changed the chair out and it was like ok sit down shut the F*** up and eat. OK.  Ordered a bottle of wine that was marked up a little excessively but nothing I couldn't live with based on the venue. The place is well appointed abet my wet chair with white table cloths attentive servers. Bread was hot & crispy with a nice good olive oil / balsamic to mix and dip. Butter was also served.  3 Appetizers were ordered the famous Rao's meatballs (+1) so we each had one, an order of the Mozzarella in Carrozza Crispy Fried Fresh Mozzarella Sandwich served with marinara Sauce and an order of the baked stuffed little neck clams.    The meatballs were good nothing special and my mothers are far superior but I'm biased. The sauce again was ok, nothing great and I asked for \"Ricotta Cheese\" and the 3 waiters this is not a racist or culturally biased statement being Hispanic had no idea what I was referring to, then stated no we don't have that for the meatballs. OK Must be dreaming thought I saw a scoop being presented with the stuffed shells at the table next to me but if you say so.  The Carrozza was again nothing special was no great improvement over fried mozzarella at any chain restaurant and the same sauce as the meatballs and not enough of it. The clams were a hunk of bread crumb that I could not find them. Hmm. Maybe it was bread crumb stuffed in the clam shells.   On to Dinner where 3 entries were ordered Conchiglie al Pomodoro e Ricotta Shell Pasta with Fresh Ricotta Cheese and Marinara Sauce (Son of a B***) I knew there was Ricotta in this place, A Pollo Scarpariello Chicken Sauteed with Hot and Sweet Italian Sausage and Yellow and Red Bell Peppers in a White Wine Sauce & Vitello alla Parmigiana Pounded and Breaded Veal Chop Topped with Marinara Sauce, Parmesan and Melted Mozzarella.     The Shell Pasta was excellent you can taste the San Maranzano Tomatoes bursting with every bite  unfortunately for $28.00 the size of the portion could have fed my 5 year old nephews. MAYBE.  The Veal Chop $48.00 was truly good, fresh veal, pounded but not too thin with a nice sweet mozzarella cheese with a tasty marinara sauce.  A good Sized portion that would not hesitate to order again.  The Pollo Scarpariello which should have been one of the highlights, unfortunately got low marks from me. Normally rich in flavor especially when chicken remains on the bone as this was prepared, it should have had a nice vinegar base or spicy taste, but the sauce was bland like natural juice or chicken broth. Sausage was tasteless if not forgetful, and the peppers were mush.  No deserts were tried but some Espressos were served. Coffee was bitter / burnt tasting and even a shot of sambucca couldn't help.   All and all a very unremarkable meal that as New York had done 10 years ago left me shall we say \"UNSATISFIED\"   With the abundant amount of restaurants to choose from in Las Vegas now days I certainly expected and to be honest demanded more of this place. It was a 2.5 stars but her at Yelp we don't have that 1/2 star ability. I've had better, I've had worse, but at these prices we shouldn't be in the 2 Star range. PASS for Me.  On a sad note the nice gentlemen (Older Italian Guy) who greeted us upon entering was celebrating a birthday on the way out with the \"Rao Family of staff and friend\" I was informed last night that he passed away last night from a friend of mine who lives in Las Vegas. Truly makes you remember to take nothing for granted in life as tomorrow  is promised to no one.",

The DJ playing was so loud that all we could hear was the thumping of the base.  Not very romantic.  My husband ordered the spaghetti and meatballs, and being $43 I expected something worthy of the price.  Instead, we both agreed it lacked flavor and woefully inadequate seasoning. My penne vodka was even worse.  I only ate a few bites and that was good enough for me to be done.  Will not be returning to this Vegas location.  Will stick to the real deal in NYC.",

    "text": "So I live in the Bay Area (CA) and while here we have a good selection of Chinese, Vietnamese, and Mexican food; here I am deprived of legitimate Italian food. Rao's in NY has some sort of crazy reservation system in which it's a two year wait list so the one In Vegas is your only shot without a reservation.  When we went there my girlfriend and I were greeted by this nice older dude who I presume was the manager siting in the corner taking a break (I think). We were seated quickly and had good service throughout the meal.  I have tried different chicken parmigiana, but have never found one I liked. When I saw on the menu that Rao's had Veal Parmigiana (I've heard that's how it's traditionally made) I had to try. The idea of breading and frying something, then covering it with melted mozzarella cheese and marinara sauce sounds so delicious to me, but I have just come to accept that it's just not for me. Nothing wrong with the meat itself, in fact I was surprised at how big the portion was, I just find this dish is always to salty for me, no matter which restaurant I try it at. One thing about Rao's Parmigiana dish is that it does not come with a side of pasta, all you get is the veal (huge bummer). My girlfriend had the pasta shells with, I believe was, ricotta and marinara sauce. It was really good and I wished I had gotten that instead.    The reason I give this place 4 instead of 5 stars is because while the food is delicious and is some of the better Italian fair that I have ever had, it did not blow my mind like I had hoped it would or how Food Network's \"Throwdown with Bobby Flay\" portrayed it as the holy grail of Italian food. If I am ever near the Las Vegas area again though, I will surely give this place another shot.",

It is sad that we were very disappointed that we did not think much of the cooking at this restaurant. The baked clams were salty, and burnt, and my side dish of meatball did not come out. The linguini and white clam sauce was quite dry, and too little garlic. My wife was not happy either, she thought the food served was pretty average for New York's standards, where we are from.",

On our second visit,  i have to say they really gave us the red carpet treatment... and this time the food was amazing!  Fritto Misto di Mare Deep Fried Calamari, Shrimp, Cod Fish and Julienne Zucchini with Remoulade and Marinara Sauce... light crisp and tender... huge serving  OSSOBUCCO ALLA MILANESE Braised Veal shank in gremolatta sauce over Safron Risotto....it was a large large serving and it was delicious... so tender and the risotto was creamy and perfect.

Sat in the bar at a table and was accused of being a liar by Angelia, a waitress, because we were sitting at a table and not ordering food.  The hostess, Leslie, told us it was fine to sit there.  Angelia proceeded to tell us that the restaurant was fully booked that night - but there were empty tables everywhere.  It was ONLY 5:30 pm!  Probably the MOST horrible customer service I have ever experienced in a restaurant.  Patrick, the Manager was somewhat kind about the situation, but the owner just happened to be in from New York and was defensive with us.  Very snobby;  should have been profusely apologizing!  I highly suggest not eating here. Being insulted for ordering a $19 glass of wine x three when I sat at a table that I was told I could sit at in front of one of my customers is not appropriate. I will tell everyone I know not to ever eat at this restaurant or their location in NYC.  PATHETIC Customer Service in a bad economy. Good luck at surviving!  GO BACK TO NEW YORK!",

    "text": "I should start by admitting that I'm sad to write this review. I was excited to go to Rao's. The service was impeccable (except for the hostesses, who had pretty negative, snooty attitudes).  I had three great wines and the wine steward was very helpful and down-to-earth.   We started with the meatballs, as an appetizer. Good news: they were very nice--juicy, soft, tasty and the sauce was simple and nice.   They were not mind-blowing, though. They were fine.   We split a bolognese for our first course. We both found it to be bland but acceptable, if a bit oily. It wasn't offensive, just really disappointing.  The pasta was spaghetti and, to be fair, it was cooked correctly. Again, plating table side was very nicely done.  We each ate maybe half of this dish.   We decided to split the second course, which was Chicken Scarpariello.  I was really surprised at this dish. It's well-reviewed and our waiter recommended it. All I can comment on was what was served on this night and on this night it was incredibly salty and sour. The number of cherry peppers was so high that the brine overpowered the entire dish.  I felt almost sick after eating. Between two of us, most of the dish was uneaten. I think we each suffered through one piece of the cut up half chicken. The dish includes a cream or butter but, for us, it just could not diminish the impact of all of those pickled cherry peppers.  We took it home and I gave it another shot the next day and felt exactly the same way.   The cannoli for dessert was overly sweet.  I like the glaceed (sp?) fruit pieces and this version had none. They opt instead to infuse the ricotta with Cointreau. It was fine, but not great. I missed a trace of cinnamon and vanilla. The shell was fresh and crunchy and good.   The bread basket was acceptable but uninteresting. They served a great, earthy  olive oil for dipping.  Its a shame. Much was fine but the Bolognese and the chicken were so disappointing.  I'm glad I went but I would not go again.",

    "text": "Olive Garden has nothing to worry about! The food is no better, but the prices? Ouch!  This is a great place to go to show you don't care about the value of a product.  For example, a Caesar Salad is $15.  Is it better than the Caesar at Italian Village in Chicago?  Not even close IMHO.  The croutons were good though.  I had the Spaghetti Bolognese upgraded to linguini with no problems.  It was a nice dish of pasta, not too large, but $28?  Not worth it at all; if it came in at around $12 at most, it would be acceptable.  So spending over $40 for a plate of pasta and a salad (no drinks) is unthinkable unless there is something magical about the food.  The only magic was the disappearance of my money.  For appetizers, we had a family platter of calamari with a few shrimp and a fillet of a white fish.  Great texture to the calamari, but I'm sure other restaurants can make the same quality for much less.  The meatballs in marinara sauce were really good, tender, flavourful and a nice size.  If this restaurant has some notoriety, it is not for the food.  Looks like the Wolf of Wall Street took a bite out of me...",

    "text": "Hubby and I just got back from Vegas and we always stay at Caesar's Palace.  For some reason, we had not tried Rao's so I made sure we checked it out this trip.  It was one of the best Italian resturats I have been to.  It wasn't super busy when we got there, so the staff was pretty attentive.  I asked to have a table in the replica room when I originally made the reservations.  It was awesome!  I loved the old style look.  It was a little dark, but we used our phone flashlights when we needed to.   We started off with the Mozzarella Carrozza.  They were like two giant fried cheese triangles.  They were perfectly breaded and the mozzarella was rich and creamy.  The marinara sauce was pretty tasty too - very fresh and flavorful.  For our entrees, hubby had the Veal Parm and I had the Penne Vodka w/Meatballs on the side.  Seriously, the veal was HUGE!!  And bone in!!!  It was so tender that hubby was cutting it with his fork.  The penne was cooked to a perfect al dente and the vodka sauce was heavanly.  I have become a big fan of Vodka sauce, so I've had it in a few resturants and this has to be one of the best, if not the best.  I thought it was pretty cool the way they presented it.  The waiter came to the table and plated it from the pan that it was cooking in.  The real star of the evening was the meatballs.  They melted in your mouth like butter.  We were actually taking slices off of them with our forks.  We were so stuffed, but I felt horrible having so much left over, so we over ate...again.  We didn't finish them, but couldn't take them with us, it was really a damn shame.    No room for dessert this time, which is shocking since I LOVE sweets.  I think next time we'll scale it back so we can try the cheesecake.  Hubby was very grateful that I set this up for us.  We will definately return.  Cheers!",

    "text": "CAESARS PALACE SWEEPSTAKES WINNER ADVENTURE #1: FIRST COMPED DINNER  As a recipient of the Caesars Palace 50th Anniversary \"Indulgence\" Sweepstakes winner one of the perks I received was $600 dining credit, which I can use at any Caesars Entertainment restaurants. Since I was staying 3 nights at Caesars Palace with $600 dining credit I was going to have dinner 3 times during my stay. Each dinner I would use no more than $200 dining credit per night. About a couple of months ago before I booked my trip I looked at other restaurants that I might be interested for dinner. One of those place was Rao's at Caesars Palace. The other was Giada at The Cromwell, which is across the street from Caesars Palace. Since they were both Italian restaurants I decided to eat at Rao's as I wanted to fully experience the dining scene at Caesars Palace.  Last week on Monday was my first day at Vegas. I ate here that night. Several months before I searched through the online menu and YouTube videos. The two meat dishes that customers seem to crave about are the Rao's Traditional Meatballs and Uncle Vincent's Lemon Chicken. I knew I couldn't order two meat dishes. I had to choose one. During my research the pasta I was interested was the linguini with Manila clams and mint. As a Filipino I hated Filipino spaghetti due to the bright red hot dog, sweet Jufran banana sauce, and soggy spaghetti. However I felt the linguini with Manila clams pasta dish could influence me to cook my own version of Filipino spaghetti. So for about several months before I entered Rao's I knew what dishes to order.   When I went to Rao's I asked my server what meat dish he would recommend Rao's Traditional Meatballs or Uncle Vincent's Lemon Chicken. He recommended the Uncle Vincent's Lemon Chicken. However I decided to order the meatballs. Growing up I hated meatballs because of my experience of eating them in a cafeteria in elementary school, middle school, and high school. Since I wasn't paying for dinner I felt that I might as well order them to give meatballs another chance. The pasta on the other hand had a slightly different change than the one I saw on the online menu. Instead of mint there was parsley. Besides those two dishes there was Caesar salad, shrimp scampi, and a glass of sangiovese.   The meatballs arrived. The verdict? I liked the meatballs at Rao's a lot as they're not heavy or dense as other meatballs I've had in the past. The meatballs at Rao's have a combination of beef, veal, and pork that give different texture of flavors. The marinara sauce cuts the richness of the meatballs. Even though they meatballs were delicious they didn't stand out as a \"wow\" factor. The linguini with Manila clams were ok. I have nothing against parsley but I think mint would have added a little more bite to this dish. Overall I think I was too passive in using my $200 dining credit as the bill was well under $200. Also I thought Rao's would be much more better than I expected. Even though I liked the Rao's Meatballs I did regret not ordering Uncle Vincent's Lemon Chicken. I think my dining experience that first night was a good experience of how to maximize your dining credit. There is a gambling saying \"Never leave money on the table\". That first night I did.",

I don't mind expensive if the quality and food is awesome.  We found the quality and taste just to be average.  We had the meatballs for a starter. You get two large, tasty meatballs.  This was the best part of the meal, but not worth the $10 per meatball that we paid. We also had the eggplant parm.  The eggplant was cut very thick (we prefer thinly cut) that are nicely breaded and fried. They are good, but really nothing special.  They come with nothing (just 5 slices of eggplant) on a plate with a little sauce and parmigiana cheese on top. Pretty average at best and not worth $30.   With so many great Italian restaurants in Vegas, there is no need to pay for average at Rao's.",

He was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and all the food items. He had great suggestions for our two kids as well and was spot on with food choices and portions.   The food was really good. I had the Crab Carbonara and it had a very generous amount of crab which was a fantastic surprise. My kids had penne vodka, and spaghetti marinara, and shared and order of meatballs. They loved their food. All in all I would strongly recommend this place.   I was going to remove one star for them not allowing me to wear my hat to dinner, but thought better of it. Lol But seriously, they do not allow hats.",

For an entree I had the shrimp scampi which I had an option of pasta or a vegetable, so I chose spinach. $38. It tasted absolutely amazing!!! But 5 shrimps with spinach for 38$ seems a little high. Everyone really enjoyed the fresh and delicious food, just seemed a little pricey. AMAZING service though! John was an outstanding waiter and I really appreciate good service. Overall I would definitely recommend!",

Not nearly as tender as it should have been and completely underwhelming in every regard.  The chicken penne dish was equally lackluster. The sun-dried tomatoes were not dried at all, the chicken had pieces of gristle, and the sauce was flavorless.  Additionally, the service was less than stellar. The food took quite a while to come out, and our waitress apparently forgot that after people eat they need to pay so they can leave at some point.  Overall a very disappointing experience.

Seemed foolish to pass on the opportunity to eat at the same restaurant in Vegas since the one in NYC will likely never happen.   We were able to get last minute reservations on a Thursday for 9:30. Restaurant has a very cool feel to it, kinda like something out of an old school Italian mob movie.   Bread basket - surprisingly enjoyable. What really makes this is the free different types of butter served with the bread. Don't ask me what they are; no one told us.   Meatballs - these were highly recommended  by our waiter; he said they always sell out of these. 15 minutes prior to closing, they still had them. When I think of excellent meatballs, I think of places like Lavo or Carbone where the meatball is full of texture and you can plainly see and taste the different meats. This was more of a uniform, over mixed meatball. It's fine, but nothing to wax poetic about. The meatballs at Lavo are.   Frito misto - so, so, so much food. This could easily serve five people comfortably, and really was good. The calamari was super, super tender, as was the shrimp. This was one of the two dishes that truly excelled.   Mozzarella Carrozza - this is basically a giant mozzarella stick. It's good, for what it is, but let's be honest about what it is. Again, it's fine, but nothing that special.   Pastas had a cool presentation factor, and were brought to you table side in stainless steel pots and mixed there, then served.   Penne Vodka - this is excellent. Pasta tastes fresh with a nice chew factor and the sauce is rich and creamy.   Linguini and Clams - there is no reason to order this. Seriously. It is spaghetti and clams with basically no real flavor. Resist temptation and skip this. We barely are it and didn't bother to bring it home.   Veal Parm - the other dish that the waiter said they always run out of was also still available at 9:45. The only thing that really distinguished this veal park from most every other one I've ever had was that it comes on the bone. Like the meatball, it's fine, but nothing you could have and call life changing.   The biggest thing this place has going for it is the novelty of what it is, and the allure to anyone from NYC that you can actually get in here. It's more less standard, expensive Italian food. If you are really dying to try Rao's in NYC and can't, coming here will satisfy the urge and make you feel like you didn't really miss out if this is the same as the original.",

My friend tried the \"famous lemon chicken\" and it tasted like dry, plain bone in chicken with lemon juice squeezed on top. Utter Crap.

I so wish there was a Rao's in my hometown! It's old school and they know how to do it right. The decor is certainly nothing fancy. It is based off the original restaurant in NYC, and both locations keep Christmas decorations up year round and have pictures of celebrity diners covering the walls. However, what it lacks in \"prettiness\" it more than makes up with in the food...  The food, oh, the glorious food! I admit that I'm a carboholic, and their bread basket offers a variety of tasty options. They also have one of the best caesar salads around, so my husband and I usually split one to start off our meal. The most recent dish I tried has been my favorite to date... Penne Vodka. It was a simple dish, but the sauce was just perfect! My dining companions all favored this dish as well out of our particular selections, but they did enjoy their own entrees very much to say the least. I know my husband loved his monsterous portion of lasagna.  Rao's will continue to be a go-to spot for my husband and I when in town. It never disappoints when you're in the mood for a good, hearty Italian meal... and for me, that's often.",

Today you pass a grand time enjoying some very palatable culinary wonders. Rao's is a restaurant I would recommend. The original restaurant was started in New York, New York in 1896 and is still owned and operated by the same family. They do a very good job as far as the food, service and atmosphere along with a respectable wine list.  One thing that stood out to me was the statute of the Blessed Mother. For those of Italian decent and Catholics I am sure that was notice. There is no pushing of religion at all but I do believe the owners are just showing respect.  Reservations were made long in advance and there was no problem with the handling of those reservations. Since my wife and I were staying at Caesar's we can't tell you about parking for the place. I signed up for their player's card and received a $20.00 discount for any restaurant in Caesar's. With the prices now at this play spot that is helpful.  The servers were all personable and professional. We informed our waiter we were not in a rush and from New Orleans and there to dine. All went well. Jim, Mike, and Adam who assisted with wine selection could not have provided better service without being invasive for a night out with my wife.   The Penne Vodka was totally enjoyed by my wife. San Marzano Tomatoes, Prosciutto Cotto, Vodka, and Cream in a very tasty and large portion made her contented.   My choice was the Veal Parmesan which was pounded and breaded. This is a most enjoyable piece of meat and the serving is large. Cost is high and portions are large.   Could not resist and knew it was a bit much but also had to taste the Meatball. Humongous meatball made with Ground Veal, Pork and Beef. Well seasoned and covered with Italian Breadcrumbs and Marinara Sauce.  A bottle of Jordan Cabernet Sauvignon was just dandy with the meal and we ended with some very fine Cappuccino.  The tables are apart so that conversations are private. The background music is at an acceptable level and the music being played was perfect for the ambiance of the restaurant. Food is tasty and flavorful and it is accompanied with attentive but not invasive service. So happy to have selected Rao's over so many choices and will return on any future visit to Las Vegas.",

I walked in and the three hostesses looked at ne like I was crazy, then told me I would have to wait 15 minutes to be seated...when there were only tables outside! I then had to ask where I woukd be seated and she grudgingly stated that there was a seat for one inside...or I could sit outside if I wanted. I wanted! Just as I was about to go find another restaurant she allowed me to sit. I was immediately greeted by one of the people working with the server, but it took the actual server a good 5 minutes to come over. I asked questiones, he made honest suggestions, and we got off to a good start. The baked clams came out within minutes...a bit on the salty side, but tasty. Spaghetti and a side of meatballs came not too soon afterwards. Pasta twirled onto the plate tableside...nice touch. But, I found it ok, not great. Overall, an overpriced and over-rated experience.",

    "text": "I know I have said that when I travel I prefer to go to places that I can't when I'm home. Rao's NYC might be the toughest reservation on the planet; Rao's Las Vegas is much easier. It's the same family who owns it and not a private equity or franchise like some other big name 'chains', from what I understand. When we checked in with the hostess, she did give me advice on how to get into NYC and I will let you know if it works.  Rao's is an old school, family style Italian restaurant. Keep that in mind when ordering or you'll end up with left overs for days, or so full you may explode. Many of the pastas and salads can be halved (which isn't noted on the menu).   We started with a roasted beet salad. It was your typical beet salad with arugula. Gramercy Guy and I disagree though; I think the beets were from a can and not roasted in house.   One of my favorite dishes ever is chicken scarpiello or sometimes called country chicken. It's chicken on the bone with sweet and spicy sausage and onions and peppers. I get it often when I see on a menu. The Rao's version is exceptional.  I don't even need to look at the menu, I know I will always get this.  We did try a new pasta this time, the ravioli purses which had pear and ricotta in a butter and sage sauce with dried cranberries. They were really, really good. Happy we only got a  1/2 order because otherwise, I wouldn't have eaten my chicken. They had a nice sweetness that I think in a strange way would work well as a dessert. How great would pasta for dessert be?  For dessert we got the profiteroles. They looked amazing and were huge, but I wasn't impressed. Maybe it was my fault for getting a French dessert in an Italian restaurant, the puff pastry was chewy and there was way too much chocolate sauce which was cold. I like it when they drizzle warm, semi-sweet chocolate right on top so the chocolate and ice cream melt together. This dessert misstep will not stop me from going back to Rao's in the future.

We ordered food to share and the servings size were decent enough to share but not over the top a small but decent serving..we started with the mixed appetizer plate and the meatballs..the app plate was good has a wide selection for everyone to try something..we orderd two for our group and it was more then enough..  The meatballs alone would get a 5 star, I absolutely loved them and the sauce it came in was amazing..I was somewhat selfish with the meatballs because they were so good.  I split a plate of spaghetti with my daughter and it was good, could of used more sauce as they actually bring it out already split, but good nonetheless.  Service: is ok, waited about 20 minutes to get a glass of wine, on top of that it was kind of stuffy and average at best..compared to many other places in LV service was lacking..  All in all 3 stars is good, the place is really pricey for what you get..I doubt I will be back unless someone is adamant about going.",

I was surprised to see Rao's there knowing their reputably exclusive family-bought-out tables at their NYC location. My boss and I sat at the bar for dinner, and it was his second night in a row. We both ordered from the special menu of the night, my boss ordered the salmon which he seemed to enjoy while I got the mushroom pasta in cream sauce. The pasta was simply delicious, full of flavors with generous portion i couldn't finish.  I've always believed Italian food should be simple, cozy and not overly fancy. Rao does just that with its hearty and honest pasta thats specially comforting after a long and tiring day of work.",

The restuarant should be smart enough to assign multiple waiters to big tables so they don't get overwhelmed.  I've been here 2x in 2016 and both times the food was excellent.  Veal parm, amazing and huge, veal milanese, the best on the planet.  Meatballs are wonderful as well.  Definitely go.  Too many cute little hostesses, they need more real waiters!!!",

    "text": "A classic NYC Italian restaurant with a location in Las Vegas.  The Vegas location is huge and very beautiful inside. Unlike NYC though, you can just walk right in and be seated without making a reservation two years ahead of time. I started off with the clams cooked in a garlic wine sauce expecting larger clams. Although they were the tiny ones, the dish itself was very good. Next came the Chicken Parm with spaghetti and a side order of meatballs. No complaints about either one of these either. My opinion is that if an Italian restaurant screws up meatballs and pasta, well what can they do right? In this case, they did it all right. I'm usually a Carmine's guy and gave this a shot. Although things were prepared slightly different, Carmine's does offer a larger portion for about 30% less. But the choice is yours here when it comes to that option since some do not care for family style dining like Carmine's and unlike Rao's.  Ambience is much more romantic in Rao's, so bring your lover here.",

    "text": "Hearing good things about this place from my cuz, a group of us agreed on this Italian joint for dinner.   They had two hostesses. We were left with what with the icier of the two women that led us to our table. Based on her demeanor, one could presume she wasn't in a good mood or didn't want to be there. I think it would have been an insurmountable challenge for her to even crack a smile.  We were seated at a table that was located in a spot that it really didn't belong. The table was located in the room to the left, in the position where a door would be placed.  During the course of the meal, a number of dining parties had to pass right by our table to get to theirs. It would have made more sense to have maybe a table for two or four here in it's place to allow more space to pass through but that's just some food for thought (no pun intended). The place is pretty loud for such a restaurant and the sound carries which is a byproduct of a room with low ceilings and a sitting near the room's entrance/exit.  We tried the famous Traditional Rao's Meatballs.  I would say the meatballs were the highlight portion of the meal. At about the size of an orange and served in two these balls of meat (pork, beef and veal) were bathed in the marinara sauce, tender and cooked immaculately.   On to the main course: the red rose went to the..... Linguine with clams and red sauce. I didn't detect the pepper flakes or white wine. Probably had I gone with the white sauce, certain elements to the dish might have stood out more. I did like how they toss the pasta at the table right before serving. I think it does prevent the sauce and ingredients from falling to the bottom of the plate. It was a solid dish but wouldn't called it spectacular. The red sauce didn't exactly pop with the pasta. Quite frankly I think I could have prepared a dish that could have resulted in similar quality.   The service and waitstaff were spotty with the exception of the water guy. If we were a group of girls, the service would have been a notch or two better. Our waiter got \"thirsty\" once a party of women were seated a few tables down from us and was more attentive to them.   At least with the dessert I got hooked up with an extra scoop of gelato, courtesy of the favorable mistake on the part of the dessert chef.    Does the food here warrant a return trip from me? Unless it's the meatballs I'd say \"naw\".  Now some of the attractive women dining here made for an interesting dinner. But that's another story for another day.",

Here in Las Vegas, it's much more accessible.  And I'm glad it is because there's something incredible about the food!   The service here is hit or miss.  The first time I came years ago, it was flawless.  It felt like you didn't just pay for the food but also for impeccable and attentive service.  That's not to say it's poor now; just that there has not been as much attention to detail in recent visits.    The wine list at Rao's is expansive and the sommelier is always knowledgable and helpful if we're having trouble deciding.    I love, love, love Rao's marinara and arrabiata sauce.  Good sauce is so vital to any italian meal and Rao's is among the best!  I sometimes want a little bit of a kick in my meal and they're usually accommodating by giving me a \"toned down\" version somewhere in between regular marinara and arrabiata.    You HAVE to try the meatballs.  I don't even like meatballs but these are legendary!  The compliments come with 2 huge meatballs and they're great if you're splitting them as an appetizer or adding them as a side to your meal.  The ravioli purses are amazing!  I love that the servers carefully and delicately transfer your meal on to a plate right at the table in front of you.  The NY cheesecake with fresh berries is simply decadent.  My favorite dessert, however, is the peanut butter tart.  We came most recently for restaurant week and, at $50 for 3 courses, it was a steal!  The usual prices are the only thing that keep me from coming more often and, as it is, I already come every couple of months.  My mouth is already watering thinking of my next meal there!",

    "text": "Ah Rao's. Living in the NYC area we have wondered what the food would be like as the Rao's in the city is hard, if not impossible, to get into. The destination is actually popular as a charity item with a reservation usually going for somewhere on the order of $10,000. Yes, that's a reservation and not the meal which we hear is of low to average cost for something in NYC.  Thus we had to head to Rao's in Las Vegas to see what the food is all about assuming...and hoping...it would be close to the elusive fare closer to our home. One of the dishes in particular that we wanted to try were the meatballs since our high mark on those has become Macaluso's in Miami Beach, FL.  So, how did everything turn out? First, it was fun going to the location. Caesars itself has always been a cut above. I remember from 30 years ago when the buffets were $2.99 at all of the other places and you would go to Caesars and spend the big $7.99 to get something really amazing. Well, at least for my first impression that scale of class still continues as you approach Rao's and see what looks like the facade of the NYC location rebuilt in the middle of the casino on the inside.  Our reservations took us to the back... It started out as a quiet meal but the only downside to the entire experience was an extremely loud table of around 10 guys shouting at each other (describing their volume and not demeanor) for the entire dinner. Oh well... I had a caesar salad -- wow, it was huge! (and good) and a salmon dish for the main entree. The main dish was excellent but what about those meatballs?  Well, I think Macaluso's has a runner in the top competition and the only way to figure out which is best is to do a side by side blind taste test on this one. Instead of trying to actually arrange that somehow I will leave the result for someone else to figure out and simple enjoy the best meatball experience at both places depending on where we are in the country.",

We ordered a variety of things including appetizers, entrees, and dessert.  The appetizers are small and overpriced for being so small.  They were delicious, but clearly overpriced.  I wasn't super impressed with the cocktails either.  The best item on the menu were the meatballs.    I think that's really the big thing with this restaurant.  The food is GREAT.  But very overpriced.    For $30 a pasta, you would think the entrees would be one of a kind.  They are not.  You can have an excellent Italien meal at Nora's (in Las Vegas) for way less!   The only other issue I had was that they didn't do separate checks.  We were with 2 other couples who have a tendency to cheap out on the tip.  We simply wanted separate checks to take care of that issue.  They said they couldn't do it....their loss!",

It was one of the best experiences of our trip to Vegas that year.  I was out at the pool and was complaining about a meal i had at another hotel, well the owner and bubbles were poolside and requested that we join them at their poolside table.  After a bit of time drinking and talking we were invited to Rao's for dinner that night. As my father and I got ready later that evening, we never could have expected the meal and service we received that night. We walked into the restaurant and Bubbles greeted us, WELCOME MR K. , and MR K. we have your table ready. Long story short, this single gesture by the Rao's family turned a so so trip to Vegas into a truly remember-able experience.      I will be back in Vegas in a couple days and look forward to my reservation that we have already booked, even though \"Bubbles\" is no longer with us.  RIP Bubbles.    I hope my future review is just as good as my first, because I'm already looking forward to the meatballs, veal parm, and wine.",

We ordered the meatballs, penne vodka, clam linguine, a house Chianti, and a vodka soda.  Meatballs: as good as everyone says they are. A must try! I would order more than one plate.  Penne vodka: I'm not Italian so I haven't had the best, but this was nothing special.  Clam linguine: pass x a thousand. Gross. Smelled rotten almost. Taste was even worse. Frank? Our server was ok. Wish he had asked us if we needed anything else or another glass of wine but it was late at night and I understand he wanted to go home. I work in food too. House Chianti was spectacular btw. Order a bottle if you can. All in all, average rating. There are better Italian restaurants out there so I probably won't be back. Not much of a selection either, but it is Italian after all..",

But make no mistake Rao s serves top notch food using top of the line ingredients. Bread basket was money, as was the quality of EVOO and balsamic.  The caprese, beet salad, anti pasto, , penne vodka (pitch perfect al dente) and meatballs were sampled and we re nothing short of extraordinary.  We left stuffed but satisfied and impressed. Subtle, low key, but professional service by Sean.  This isnt cheap but nothing is in Vegas. If you re into Italian, you ll dig Rai 's.  RECOMMENDED.",

The crazy thing is that I saw the owner, Frank Pellegrino Jr, standing by the wall sipping on some coffee and I walked over and struck up a conversation with him.  I told him I'd seen him on tv a few times.  Frankie is a total class act.  Extremely approachable and grateful.  He thanked me for coming over to talk to him and asked where our party was sitting.  He then added, 'I'd like to buy you all a round.'  He bought us a bottle of wine!    Aside from that really cool experience, we asked Mike, our bartender (really good guy) what he recommended.  \"Without a doubt, you have to have our meatballs, our fried mozzarella and the clams.\"  We ordered one of each and they were really, really good.    We wanted to try a main course and split it and Mike recommended his favorite.  He asked us to order the veal parmesan and it really was a wonderful plate.  The size was big enough to feed two if you order an appetizer, say the meatballs to go with it.      The ambience is very cool.  It's low lit, I saw a bocce ball court in the back, great music and also the photos of the celebrities on the walls are pretty neat, as well.    New York City is pretty far from here and I hear getting a table there can be quite difficult.  So, I'm happy we have a Rao's here in Vegas.  We'll come back for sure.",

    "text": "After viewing reviews and menus of many restaurants in Vegas, I opted to book a reservation at Rao's to celebrate my birthday. I had wanted something more upscale with a menu that is accommodating as I am a vegetarian but my fellow travelers are not.   My reservation had been made for 6:45PM, as nothing was available between 7 and 8 PM. We arrived to the restaurant close to 7, after being held up waiting on transportation. I was nervous that they would cancel the reservation and I'd miss out, but we had no problem when we got to the restaurant.  We were seated at a table in the New York replica room. Our server was Shaun A, who was very attentive and accommodating - he was always quick to refill waters and gave us plenty of time to review menus and enjoy our meal and time together. I enjoyed the ambiance and it did was easy to forget that you were in a busy restaurant as it was not noisy nor did it have a crowded feeling.  I had a caprese salad to start, which had the freshest mozzarella I've been able to experience thus far. I followed it up with the ravioli purses, after seeing many raves. The dish is so flavorful, and it was actually hot - unlike food you'll find at most restaurants today. Upon being brought to the table, a member of my group commented that it was a good portion - it certainly looks that way, but it is deceiving! This little bites are very filling, and sweet. As much as I wanted to continue eating them due to them being good, I was unable to.   Others in my group ordered the meatballs, which received great reviews. One had the house salad, remarking that it was the best salad he had ever eaten (he is no salad connoisseur, but it did appear to have a good mix of flavors). He also had rave reviews about the pork chop he had ordered and the potatoes.   We opted not to order dessert. The menu was very appealing, but none of us could continue eating. I was brought a tiramisu, however, which was phenomenal. I don't eat tiramisu that often, but this one was again full of flavor and topped with a good quality cocoa and one I would order.  Our bill ended up coming out to around $68 per person. We could cut this cost down some on a future visit by sharing entrees as they are very filling. Two in the group ordered meatballs, for example, but could only manage to eat one each and myself and another each consumed about half of our ravioli purses. The restaurant allows for sharing without any hassle, even encouraging it for some items.   I am really happy that I opted to book at Rao's and that it did not disappoint. It will definitely be considered for future visits and recommended to others.",

For dessert we split the peanut butter tart and it's to die for! So good I still think about it!  If you love Italian food, this place is not to be missed in Las Vegas. it's a little pricey, but really not bad for the quality and service you get. Run, don't walk!",

Problem is the original is very small. Faux  memorabilia on the walls.",

The bruschetta was yummy and I had a delicious wine that our waiter recommended.   I was excited for the ravioli. I'm talking eat a small breakfast and fruit for lunch excited. I was prepared to eat but all I could taste was garlic. Now I love garlic but I couldn't taste the sweetness in the sauce, the basil, the spinach or even the ricotta. It was straight vampire killing garlic.   My husband's dish was the same and he is a card carrying garlic lover, which is not always fun for me. He even said, \"wow that's A LOT of garlic maybe I shouldn't eat all of this.\" If you like to sweat out your garlic late go for it.",

    "text": "I love Rao's for two things 1. Penne in vodka sauce and 2. their meatballs. If those are the only two items offered to me when I visit, I would not feel like I missed out on anything. I have dined here a few times and each time we go big and try a few more items, but the two dishes that sit close by will always be these two. The al dente penne tosses in the rose cream sauce with bits of ham always brings a smile to my face. I am still a kid that plays with his food. Lacing each individual piece over a prong of the fork and eating them one by one is my way to savor this pasta. The mix of veal, pork, and beef in the meatballs makes them what they are. The size and portion is unheard of. Complaints about leaving hungry should never happen.   The service is fast and friendly. Small talk is relaxed and feels like it is coming from the small mom and pop type of shop. Although Rao's is upscale in every sense of the word, it was not stuffy.   We ended our meal with  a dessert buffet. Nothing stood out as a must have again, but it was nice to try them. The ice cream in the profiteroles was my favorite. Usually, I love tiramisu, but the lady fingers had lost their consistency long ago and turned to mush. The flavor was there.",

    "text": "This review is long overdue but hey what can I say I am a busy guy. I came to Vegas for my 35th birthday with my brother and a close friend in October of 2011. When we do Vegas, we always try and go big meaning we do the fancy expensive restaurants that we normally wouldn't ever do at home. I wanted to eat at Rao's for my birthday dinner since I love Italian food and am a mob buff. I read about the history of the original Rao's Restaurant in New York and the traditions they kept and used to authenticate the Las Vegas location. Also I read that at least one of the owners Frank Pellegrino and his son Frank Pellegrino Jr. were there every night. Do some research and you'll see you'll remember Frank Pellegrino from Goodfellas and the Sopranos.  As I mentioned in the above paragraph the Las Vegas Rao's took some of the traditions from their New York location and put them here. When you walk in you see the bar decorated with the Christmas decorations up regardless of what time of year it is. It's a really warm inviting vibe with the Christmas lights and holly especially since I love Christmas. Also the jukebox is blaring music but I have to say they have only good stuff (real music) on the jukebox such as Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, and Louis Prima and I was honored to be able to play some songs and that jukebox. They also have framed photos covering almost every area of the walls of family and celebrities who autographed them.  The food was awesome, real authentic Italian cuisine. I had the Mozzarella Planks for an appetizer, Chicken Parmesan for the main course and a glass of Chianti. The whole meal was delicious and the service was great. Picture an atmosphere where the music is loud, everyone there is enjoying themselves with great food and drink and you got Rao's.  We paid our bill and as we were leaving I noticed the owner Frank Pellegrino Jr. by the bar area. I went up to him and introduced myself and told him it was my first time dining at Rao's and that my party and I loved everything about the whole Rao's experience from the ambience and atmosphere to the food. He was very kind, courteous and receptive and thanked me for coming in and asked if he could buy me and my party a round of drinks at the bar. I was floored by this kind gesture and said I appreciated it but it wasn't necessary and he said he insisted. I called my brother and my friend and they met me back at the bar and I introduced them to Mr. Pellegrino Jr. and we got to chill at the bar with a nice drink after dinner.  Amazing service like this is so rare and hard to find now a days so that's why I take the time to make sure the world knows about it when it happens. Frank Pellegrino Jr. and the Rao's staff are all class acts and they make you feel like part of their family. I will be back for sure next time and I am in Vegas and would give this place 10 stars if I had the option!",

Low dimmed lights, quiet music ~ definitely a great place for a date. The servings are quite large so it is also great for large groups.   For starters, we had the calamari and the roasted beet salad. The calamari was delicious. It had a light breading with the right amount of crunch. It comes with tartar sauce and marinara sauce. The beet salad was delightful. I'm actually not a big fan of beets, but man these ones were delicious! The pistachios and goat cheese paired well with the arugula and beets was yummy.   We had two pasta dishes: the ravioli purses and their signature penne vodka. The penne vodka was delicious. The sauce was perfect. The ravioli purses was amazing! It's stuffed with pear and ricotta cheese in a butter, sage, and cranberry sauce. I've never had anything that tasted like this before. It was delicious!   For the main entrees we had the lemon chicken, pork chop, meatballs, and shrimp. My personal favorite were the meatballs. I always think the meatballs have a fairly generic taste and I've never been a big fan, but man, these meatballs are amazing! I would recommend hundred percent! The pork chop was also delicious. If you're a fan of pickled peppers, you'd love this. The lemon chicken was very tasty and juicy. The shrimp was also very good.   As far as the desserts, my personal favorite was the tiramisu but the cheesecake and the cannolis were yummy as well.  Service, food, and ambience was definitely five stars all the way.",

I wasn't drinking alcohol but ordered a soft drink and reviewed the menu I'm already familiar with.  I asked the bartender/server if it was possible to order the famous \"softball size\" meatball with a side (Caesar) salad.  He told me the only Caesar salad was large---too much for me when I was only moderately hungry.  Instead, he suggested the Caprese salad.  The meatball was bland even in the gravy and the Caprese salad was uninspiring.  The bartender/server never checked back with me with only one other customer at the entire bar much less refill my drink.  It was over $35 for mediocre food and worse service.",

Grant it, this is not the original, that is impossible to get into, but I read an article that read \"if you want to eat at Rao's NY, fly to Vegas, it's the same, that even a family member was always at the Vegas location to ensure quality\"..    Well, it was disappointing.   This place epitomized to me the old \"Vegas food\" that was too hyped and just meh.     The ambiance was fine, dark, old school Italian, a the lamps are the Rao's tomato sauce, which all the products are sold everywhere.  There were lots of empty tables on a Thursday night at 8:30 pm.  Meatballs are considered a must have, and they were very fluffy, not dense at all.  The famous tomato sauce though, lacked something. Grant it, I'm not Italian, but have been to Italy a few times, but I even loved the sauce that is in my Soprano's cook book better than this 'famous sauce'.  I had the ravioli that was suggested, a pear/ricotta ravioli in brown butter (could not taste the pear, very bland, needed salt) they weren't sweet or savory (I actually hit it with a squeeze of lemon from my water and it brightened it up).  My husband had the famous lemon chicken, which had a decent char, and but overly lemony.  We've had Italian lemon chicken before, and this wasn't earth shattering or memorable unfortunately.  This was our most expensive and least favorite meal for the entire weekend.  We started here on Thursday, but Friday & Saturday were MUCH better (and less expensive) alternatives.

Seafood was fresh, pasta was al dente and the sauce was... I mean it's Raos, I had an extra bread basket brought over for the sauce. We also got a side of meatballs and they were huge and tender and melt in your mouth. We didn't mean to get dessert, but we accidentally ordered the profiteroles which were filled with vanilla gelato and yeah, big oops :) Go here! See the Trevi Fountain while you're at it.

Solely two reasons for this decision. #1, I heard the meatballs were out of this world. #2, there is no way humanly possible that I would ever have the opportunity to visit the original Rao's which is located in Harlem. I can easily say that these were the best meatballs I've ever had. Super moist, loaded with flavor, and very filling. The veal parm was just ok and the spaghetti bolognese was rather dry. I was happy with my 2 cocktails but my BF ended up leaving his practically untouched. Rather disappointing for a $17 cocktail. I enjoyed the music but the sound was a little too low. The servers were very attentive, however, the hostess had a bit of a chip on her shoulder as she tapped her counter signaling for me to leave my drink behind before entering the restaurant. Doubtful I'll be back for another meal... possibly just for meatballs at the bar.",

We ordered the meatballs as an appetizer and they were AMAZING.  Anyone who claims anything else must have gotten something else because they were so moist you could slice them into thin slices with just your fork.  For the main course, we ordered the penne pasta with vodka sauce and ravioli.  Both items are a MUST - I couldn't decide which one I liked better.  The vodka sauce was so full of flavor and the pasta was cooked perfectly.  The ravioli was perfectly prepared as well with a very nice hint of sweetness from the pear.  For folks who claim it took too long for the food to come out, I disagree.  The dinner was timed perfectly for a relaxing, enjoyable dinner.  If you're in that big of a hurry, there are a ton of fast food joints in Vegas..knock yourselves out!  :)  Great beginning to our evening.  Thanks Rao's!",

Our server Russ was really nice, informative and personable. He came over to us promptly and told us the specials and gave us his recommendations which was nice. We ordered drinks and he let us know he was putting in our food once we'd had a minute to enjoy them which was nice. Then our food came out and I was wishing I'd ordered what my mom had! Her ravioli purses were amazing , sweet but also savoury. My meal was way too rich but that's how a carbonara is made. It was the crab carbonara I'd had but to be honest the carb was underwhelming. The portion of crab was minimal and the flavour of it was overpowered by cheese and pepper, it could be fixed so that the crab shines in this dish a bit more. Otherwise, the food was pretty good and the service great- we gambled on this restaurant and I'd say we broken even here.",

    "text": "Top notch hospitality!  Being big fans of the Rao sauce, we were thrilled to have dinner at the Rao's in Las Vegas on 4/5/19.  The restaurant was beautiful inside and out.  The interiors were covered beautifully wall to wall of celebrity photos, and we were promptly seated at a booth in the first main room, near the fireplace with some Christmas decor.  I didn't mind the decor at all because I love Christmas, and thought it added to the old school Italian charm.  +10 points for using the Rao jars for lamps at each table, talk about genius branding!  Our server was attentive, friendly, helpful and courteous, and his services were on point as he acknowledged my husband, kid and I individually.  He suggested a few wines to my husband and even let my husband taste 2 of the house wines, but was never pushy.    The meal came promptly and good portions, the caprese salad was the best we had ever had, everything was so fresh and delicious, especially the delicious balsamic vinegar, which ties and balances everything together so nicely.  Appetizers and entrees were also fantastic, and we enjoyed the table service when our meatball and pasta were plated tableside.  The ambiance and the meal were both very enjoyable and relaxing, and but the grand finale was the most amazing part of our dining experience.  After we were done with dinner, we lingered around the main area because like I mentioned, we are addicted to the Rao sauce at home, so we were drooling over the cookbooks and the merch, and my kid was intrigued by all the old school celebrity photos, so we were really taking our sweet time taking group photos and checking out the merch with my husband.  After one of the matre D kindly offered to take a family photo for us, our kind server, ran towards us, looking extraordinarily excited and happy.  He asked about our meal, making sure we had a good time, in a way that we kinda knew he had something to tell us.  Lo and behold, he handed my husband his phone, which had slipped out onto the booth (probably during payment) at the end of the meal.  We thanked the kind gentleman profusely and truly thought he was the highlight of a perfect meal.  What a class act!  Our dinner met and exceeded my expectations and I was truly in awe of the gentleman's kindness.",

They original opened in NYC many years ago and we are so happy they brought their legacy to Las Vegas. First off there sauce is one of kind, I haven't ate sauce like this since my grandmother made it from scratch from ripe Roma tomato's in the backyard. The meatballs are out of this world!!!! If you haven't tried Raos meatballs I suggest you do, I can assure you that you will never eat another meatball from anywhere else again. Everything we order was 1000% authentic Italian food. Just like the way they cook in Italy. Myself, being born to immigrant parents, all they cooked was good Italian food, at Raos, I thought I was back in my parents kitchen.  The baked muscles were out of this world, everything we ate was so good. The atmosphere is very nice, the waitress was a total sweetheart and was so helpful and attentive. I recommend you try this place and I can promise you that you will agree. Raos has been around since 1896, and there's a reason why they are still open today. You could tell all of the dishes are cooked with love. Go there hungry & enjoy a True genuine piece of Italian culture. Thank you Frankie Jr. for everything",

    "text": "My girlfriend and I are hardcore devotees of Rao's pasta sauces.   Store-bought or not, these lil' jars of flavor can easily elevate any old pasta meal to the next level, thanks a blend of fresh ingredients and an emphasis on natural, genuine flavors. However, despite having spent the better portion of her life in NYC, my girl has never had the chance to visit the actual Rao's outpost in New York's Upper East Side (although you can't really fault her for not being one of the place's dozen or so lucky regulars...!). Thus, in celebrating our six months together earlier this summer, we jumped at the chance to visit the restaurant that bears the very same name as our favorite brand of Italian food products.  The atmosphere at Rao's is homey and down-to-earth. Upon entering, the dark woods and dim lighting immediately transported me from the charged, uptempo atmosphere of the Strip into something akin to Michael Corleone's dining room. The charm at Rao's was all the more amped up by our table, which was located in the restaurant's \"Christmas\" room (see photos!). Complete with a staggering variety of portraits depicting NYC's who's who, the room does an outstanding job of making you as though you're part of \"the club.\"  The best detail of all, however, was was the loud, borderline obnoxious New Yorker seated one table over - whose accent made him stand out from every other conversation in the room. We couldn't stop giggling at his exclamations to his tablemates (\"The food here is absolutely pheNAWmenal!\" \"Waiter, we're gonna need maw woine!\"), and it was thanks to him that our dinner felt pretty much as New York as a meal could get.  The vibes of family and gracious charm were driven home by the fantastic service that we received from a gent whom I believe is named Alex. Despite the flurry of questions thrown (We must've asked him about 6-7 entrees that we were choosing from, each of which he explained in lovingly extensive detail!), Alex never gave us anything less than his undivided attention. I'd give his service six stars, if I could.    We started out with a couple glasses of the house wise, which was refreshing, crisp, and palette cleansing.   The Caprese Salad appetizer was earthy and fresh. The creamy burrata and heirloom tomatoes combined to create a wonderful melding of flavors. The house blend balsamic used at Rao's, however, was a show-stopper; we learned that the vinegar used by Rao's undergoes a specific, twelve-year aging process (so as to maximize its depth of flavor). The results of this process were easy to identify, and I had to pry myself away from a second bread basket to make room for the rest of my meal.   In the hopes of getting a full idea of what the menu at Rao's had to offer, we ordered three entrees - my girlfriend got the Spaghetti Bolognese, I ordered Beef Lasagna, and we tacked on a serving of Uncle Vincent's Lemon Chicken, too. (Needless to say. we were in full indulgence mode.)  Our food was brought out quickly, and in mammoth portions; my Lasagna alone seemed like it could've been used as a boat anchor. These big serving sizes were much appreciated, however - as the flavors of Rao's entrees were just as massive and satisfying. The bolognese blends used in our two pasta dishes were fantastic, striking a welcome balance between meatiness and crisp tomato flavor. My lasagna had to have been seven or eight layers deep - with ricotta, parmesan, and mozzarella lending a creaminess that counterbalanced the umami meat flavors of the bolognese.  The Lemon Chicken was juicy and had a great char. The strong lemon flavor paired off well in between bites of tomato sauce-laden pasta, but I'm not sure if I would have enjoyed a full serving of this dish on its own. The tanginess might have gotten a little played out without accompaniment from another entree.  The icing on the cake for our Rao's experience was that of our unexpected dessert course (no pun intended!). While being seated, I briefly mentioned that my girlfriend and I were celebrating an anniversary. Although the GF and I were given a dessert menu to scope out towards the conclusion of our meal - a very clever deception tactic on the part of the Rao's staff - we were entirely blindsided when Alex presented us with a heaping (and free!!!) portion of Caramel Apple Cheesecake, complete with a message from the chef. As he explained, \"a little birdy\" had happened to mention that we were commemorating a special occasion, and we were absolutely swept off our feet by this unexpected gesture of hospitality. With plenty of leftovers, my girlfriend and I waddled out of Rao's with the biggest grins on our faces!  According to its menu, Rao's has been serving up homestyle Italian food for over a century. All this practice definitely amounted to something - I haven't had an Italian meal this memorable in a long time, if ever. Paying another visit to Rao's is near the top of my things to do the next time I'm in Sin City.",

We had seen Rao's on TV years ago on the Food Network, so of course we made a point to stop by when we were in Las Vegas.  I was able to make reservations for 7:00pm on a Friday earlier that same day and they had plenty of reservation spots available. There was also no wait when we arrived, so it's easy to get into. Exactly the opposite of the New York location!  They started with the Fritto Misto which was supposed to be a mix of three different kinds of seafood, but ended up to be mostly calamari. I had a cup of their made in house Tomato Soup with was great and came with fried cheese which was a nice tasty touch.  They had two different vegetarian pastas for entrees, so I had the Ricotta and Pear Purses in the Brown Butter Sauce. They were great! I loved the pears with the cheese, and the pasta was cooked perfectly. They make them in house, and you can tell.  My Husband had the Veal Piccata which was HUGE and my Husband really liked it. He had never had it before, but thought it had great flavor. It was such a large portion that he couldn't even finish it which is hard to do!  Service was great and attentive, and we decided that we would come back again. It wasn't my favorite Italian restaurant, but I'm glad we went.",

The wait staff acted is they were doing us a favor by letting us eat there.  Our head waiter was more interested BS'ing to his friend at the next table than waiting on us. Finally after ordering, the food came out quickly.  But I have had better Italian out of a chef boy r d can.  The bill came to $130 for a glass of wine, lasagne and a spaghetti, no appetizer or salad. Don't waste your time or money especially when there are fabulous restaurants like Bobby Flay's at Caesar's Palace.",

I get it; they want to set the mood for an Italian, old style feel but it was to the point where we had to put a light from our cell phones towards the menus to read them. Our waiter was very nice. The problem I had was that this place is very pricey and we had to wait a good 45 min to close to an hour for our food. I would understand if the place was crowded but it wasn't. There were several empty tables. My meal was delicious as well as everyone else in our party but do I think it's over priced for the average service we received? Yes. If I'm paying $30-50 per plate, I expect to receive superior and fast service. This was not the waiters' fault. He was nice. I'd say save your money and find another place to eat.",

I mean the food was good but the portions are small for the prices you pay. We ordered the meatballs, beet salad, caprese salad to start and for dinner house salad, eggplant parmesan, two orders of beef lasagna. Sounds like a lot but it really wasn't. The cheque was a lot for what we ordered. Service was nice, but probably wouldn't go back. Tables and chairs were not comfortable lol but I think they do that to resemble the old school NY restaurant.",

Christmas decorations were still up - poinsettias and wreaths - what's up with that?  When the rest of the group show up, we go to the hostess stand to be seated.  I asked if we were going to be seated in one of the back rooms which, according to Yelpers, was very nice.  \"Of course, sir, we have you seated in one of our very nice replica rooms in the back,\" was the reply.  We were led back to our table in the back.  While every other table in the room was carefully and orderly situated, our table appeared to be slapped down in an awkwardly right in front of the kitchen door.  Our table and our group stuck out like a sore thumb.  But our view of the dishwashing area of the kitchen was great!  The food is \"traditional\" Americanized Italian place.  Red sauce, pasta, cheese, etc.  The meatballs were justifiably worth getting - moist and savory - not the best but pretty dang good.  Pastas were ok, meats were ok.  Portions were large.  Service was uninspired.      Competent? Yes.  Memorable? No.",

Our bartender/server was friendly and delightful (shamefully I've forgotten his name). The bread and butter were sinful, as expected at a solid Italian establishment. I had a nice glass of rose- another worthy name forgotten, oops.  The food was tasty and satisfying- three of us (dainty ladies) split a fresh and tangy Caesar salad, linguini with clams (I scraped the bowl for more tender, tasty clams and wasn't disappointed), and 2 house meatballs. We were too full for dessert by the end, and almost late for our show!  The ambience is dark and rich, not unlike what you'd expect to see in some mafia movie. I've never been to the original location in NYC so I can't compare.  A nice surprise!",

    "text": "Rao's Las Vegas is a home-style Italian American eatery that feels like you've stepped back in time, the walls are covered with framed items and year round Christmas decorations.  The menu is designed for you go with a group and eat family-style.  For our First Course we had the Fritto Misto which was a pile of battered and deep fried shredded zucchini, calamari, and a few pieces of shrimp and cod served with marinara and tarter sauces.  It was a large appetizer which could easily be shared between 5-6 people, but it was nothing special.  A bit greasy, a bit bland, I didn't want any more after a few bites.  For our Second Course we had the Penne Vodka.  The penne was pretty al dente, probably the least cooked you could eat pasta without complaining it was still raw.  The pink prosciutto, tomato-cream sauce was tasty.  Portion wise this could have easily been split by 3-4 as a first entree.  For our Third Course we had the Ossobuco, a huge veal shank with saffron risotto.  The veal wasn't as tender as I would have hoped, it didn't fall off the bone and wasn't deep and rich in flavor.  I couldn't taste the saffron in the risotto and it was wet in texture from the veal jus poured over it.  As a second entree, this could have been shared by 3-4.  For a Side, we ordered the Rao's Meatball which was tender and moist, but a bit bland, and big enough for 4 to share.  We skipped the Fourth Course, dessert, because we were full and with three lack-luster courses under our belts decided we were done.  For 2 people, without drinks, our meal was $158.00, and the leftovers we took home could have easily fed 2 more.  For the price, there are definitely better eats in Vegas.  If you do want to try Rao's, come with a group to help you eat the volume of food and spread out the cost.",

We got a cannoli and tiramisu those were great hence 2 stars but 14 bucks each??!!come on thats insane.After this meal i was still hungry luckily they give u bread!!I would not recommend and not return this place is overpriced and quality and portions are horrible.Go to buca or brio.The Worst Italian restaurant I have ever been too!!

Started out with the Cannellini & Scarolla soup, which was pretty good.  For a dinner entree, I had a simple dish of spaghetti in tomato sauce accompanied with a meatball, which is ordered separately.  Granted, this wasn't exactly the ideal dish to allow the restaurant to flex it's culinary might, but I came away definitely less impressed with the overall experience from my first visit--primarily due to a difference in quality of service.  I think Rao's could best be summarized as a disappointment of expectations.  The food is solid, for the most part, but as a major restaurant in Caesar's Palace, I expected more of a \"wow factor\" that never materialized.",

I will say though, that they have the most amazing bread basket evar. You have your long ones, your regular ones, your flat ones, your crispy ones, oh so much fun!  We sat at the bar because we didn't wanna wait 30 minutes or so for a table and I kept getting these weird vibes from our bartender/waiter. Like he'd pause and stare at us after each request, like we had just asked for something unreasonable. Probably because we didn't order any drinks. Lame, let me enjoy my dinner in peace without your condescending looks, old man! Anyway, I wouldn't come back here, as there are far superior places to eat in Vegas.",

I ordered the Scottish salmon.  I didn't realize you could screw up a piece of salmon this bad.  The pepper crust was so obnoxious that I was sneezing.  We also got some fried calamari that was no different from the kind you buy at a bar.  I gave Rao's an extra star because the service was attentive, the patio was nice and the people at the front were very nice and accommodating.     I think this story about waiting 2 years for a reservation is more of a jedi mind trick than anything.   I've waited 2 hours at the DMV.  Does this mean it's exclusive or good?  Maybe the NY experience is different or if you took the people from the NY location and transplanted them into the Vegas location, I could begin to understand the hype.",

I had the bruschetta to start that came with one piece with artichokes and one piece with tomatoes.  Then I had one of their pastas, it was fine but not memorable.  I did try their famous meatball which was really good but also so hyped that it was a little hard to live up to the impossibly high standards, but it was good.  I didn't get dessert but I did see a chocolate hockey puck looking dessert that had some peanut butter in it that looked amazing!",

That isn't easy as there is cigarette smoke from the casino to compete with. We were going to sit inside which has a great interior like the classic old school NY Italian restaurant without being cheesy. We decided to sit on the outside part of the place. It was a little warm inside that night.  Service was great from waiter to busboy. It's usually a good sign when the bread they bring out which came immediately is great. My partner had the penne ala vodka and a ceasar salad. He said both were some of the best he has had.  I had the rigatoni with pancetta, onions and tomato sauce. It was excellent. It's not cheap here as most places are not in LV but I would happily eat here again.",

    "text": "This scenario seems familiar to most...dinner for a friend's birthday...pick somewhere nice with a wide variety of food options that most in the party have not eaten at before.  The celebrant decided on Rao's in Caesar's.  I had forgotten until I walked up to the restaurant that I had actually eaten there twice before.  After this experience, I remember why I didn't remember them the first two times.    Our night began with a phone call to the restaurant to find out the dress code/attire.  We were told that it was business casual and that jeans were not permitted.  We asked even for women if they were nice jeans and were told we would be \"turned away.\"  Upon arriving at the restaurant, the first guest I saw seated was wearing a Hawaiian print button up shirt, tan shorts and flip flops.  Next I saw a women in a tank top, white shorts and tennis shoes.  I had changed out of my outfit to meet their requirements, making us 20 minutes late, only to find out when we got there that we still would have been better dressed then some of the patrons.  We were seated in a far corner in the back of the restaurant.  Greeted promptly with menus and a discussion of the specials.  The rest of my party was a bit put-off when we were told that the poached salmon was actually served in a \"foil-bag.\"  We ordered drinks and reviewed the menu.  I explained what I had eaten before and what I thought might be good selections.  Being that I had been there before I decided to try something new.  Their vodka sauce is truly amazing and they had a ricotta shell dish that came with their famous marinara sauce, so I decided to switch it out with the vodka sauce.  The rest of the party gave their orders.  Our waiter then became non-existent and seemed rushed or busy whenever he did finally come over to check on us.   Food came out after a long wait (the restaurant wasn't even busy)...mine looked like a glorified version of mac and cheese made with pasta shells and a vodka sauce.  I was very disappointed that there wasn't any ricotta in the shells.  When I inquired about it with the waiter, he told me I had ordered it that way.  I knew I had specifically asked for ricotta so he offered to bring me a side of ricotta.   The rest of the party was not satisfied with their meals either.  The waiter never asked what we thought about our meals.  When we finally got our check, we about passed out.  The drinks we had been ordering (Red Bull and house vodka) were $22 each.  These were tiny little cocktails that are served in the same size glasses that you get comp'd drinks in, while gambling in a  casino.  They charged separately for the Red Bull and vodka, which most places do, but charged us for a full Red Bull with each drink, with out bringing out the remaining Red Bull to the table (as most places do.)  We were appalled.  Dinner was over $250 per couple, the food was below average, and the service was horrible.  We even told him we were there for our friend's birthday and he looked at us like, \"so?\"   I can pretty much guarantee I will NEVER eat at Rao's again.  I am more than willing to pay decent prices for excellent food and service, but for what we received at Rao's, I would have rather gone to The Olive Garden and saved $200!  At least there I can get unlimited salad and breadsticks!  LOL I am not a glutton for punishment...this girl will NEVER make the mistake of going to Rao's for a nice night out with friends, EVER again.",

The two main problems I have with Rao's are the prices and the service.  Took forever for the waiter to take our order, getting our water refilled was a pain, and we had to remind him about our order of meatballs several times.  Food was good but flavors were one dimensional.  I had the fusilli with cabbage and sausage, my wife wife had the gnocchi, and we split an order of meatballs.  My pasta was cooked perfectly but the flavor was flat.  Wife's gnocchi were also well cooked but the flavor wasn't much different than my fusilli.  Meatballs were super tender but could have used more seasoning, especially considering it's $15 for two.  If you're going to pay this much for Italian food you should go to one of Mario Batali's places at the Venetian.  Food and service are significantly better and I'm pretty sure it's a little less expensive.  Locals, go to Nora's instead - it blows Rao's out of the water.",

The food here is mostly pasta.  You would think for $30.00, and a serving size that would fit in a salad bowl, the pasta would be good.  Sorry, it's not good, and sadly, not even house made pasta, it is purchased outside, as told by the waiter. The fried calamari was nothing to write home about either. Three people, three pasta dishes, 1 appetizer, 1 meatball (half order) 1 glass of wine $285.00 not worth the money at all.  Only upside, waiter was very friendly.",

Our server came and told us the specials, without even offering to take a drink order.  The bread was delicious, and the meatballs were the best I've ever had.  On the other hand, the baked clams, bruschetta, \"pasta of the day,\" veal marsala, and the veal chop were among the worst I have ever had.  The bruschetta tasted like canned artichoke hearts.  The breading on the veal marsala was mushy, and the veal itself was overcooked.  The sauce was thick, syrupy, and had no mushroom or lemon flavor.  It tasted like brown gravy with a splash of wine added.  The \"pasta of the day\" was a pasta in mushroom cream sauce.  The pasta was overcooked, and the sauce tasted like a beef stroganoff without the beef.  The veal chop was almost raw in the middle (coming from a group of medium rare meat eaters at that), and was also tough, and lacking in flavor.  The cherry pepper sauce was great, but not enough to cover up the undercooked, underseasoned piece of meat it was served with.  Other than the veal marsala, nothing was terrible, but for the prices, definitely not worth it, and compared to the stories we have heard from the NY restaurant and recipes we have tried at home from the cookbooks, very disappointing.  Definitely my most underwhelming dining experience in years.",

My friend had the veal milanese which she reported was w/o taste and dry as a bone.  I had the world famous lemon chicken.  The chicken had been marinated so long that it was like eating mashed potatoes.   And the lemon sauce was overpowering and destroyed any taste the chicken might have had before the lemon sauce arrived on the scene.  We tried the apple tart for dessert.  It was terrible.  I have had much better ones from the supermarket freezer section.

Upon arriving at 10 p.m. (Vegas time, on a Monday night) we were told they didn't have a table for two (despite our being able to see many open tables). That's ok, we're happy to sit at the bar. The bartender was super nice, very helpful with suggestions for food & wine. We tried a Tuscan red (1st time, despite being AVID wine drinkers & Italian food & restaurant fans) and it was great. My husband got the Chicken Scappiolini (or something like that, the menu isn't available on line) at the bartenders suggestion & he LOVED it! Tons of chicken (bone in) & sausage, smothered in red, yellow & green (sweet & hot) peppers, with onions & garlic. Smelled amazing! I had the Ravioli Pillows (beggars purses stuffed with Ricotta & pear, (wow) in a light parmesean, butter, sage, cranberry, oil sauce).... they were rich & decadent & delish!!! Absolutely delicious dinner. I DO recommend Rao's & believe the hype now. We will continue our pursuit of the NY location, but would definitely return to the Vegas one as well.",

I went about 3 years ago when they first opened with my family and we ordered our favorite dishes that we have cooked at home from their cookbook.  We make the lemon chicken often and when we had it at the restaurant is was so delicious.  The steak with peppers was one of my husbands favorites.  We were raving about the restaurants to our friends that we were having dinner with and this time my husband and I were disappointed.  We ordered the salad and it was very good.  Clams Oreganato was our appetizers and they were good.   Then we had the rigatoni with marinara sauce and meatballs which was just OK.  Both dishes needed more tomato sauce.  Our friends enjoyed the lemon chicken and the linguine with clams. We had plans to go back here another night but after this dinner we decided to go somewhere else.  Really disappointed that it wasn't as good as it was the first time we went there.   I have never had the pleasure of dining at the original Raos in NY but if it is anything like the one in Las Vegas, I am not sure what all the hoopla is all about.",

We started with a bowl of pasta fagioli - the worst we've ever tasted. I could only eat 2 spoonfuls. Then we ordered our entrees. I ordered the Shrimp Scampi on a bed of angel hair pasta. I sent it back because it wasn't cooked enough and was very fishy and had no flavor.  So I decided to keep it simple and order pasta marinara (there aren't too many other pasta choices). The sauce was awful - I took two bites and couldn't eat it, but I didn't want to send it back - I had had enough! My husband ordered the Ossobuco on a bed of risotto which was mediocre, and the risotto was over salted and not edible. The corkage is $35, so we opted to buy a bottle of wine for $121 - outrageous. We didn't have dessert or coffee. Our bill was $225 for wine, a pasta dish and an ossobuco. Don't waste your money.  No wonder it was so easy to get a reservation on a Saturday night.  We work hard for our money, and we don't want anyone else to get ripped off.  However, the staff was very friendly.",

    "text": "my wife and I had dinner for two before catching an early show. we saw / heard about the restaurant on tv during a bobby flay throwdown and we figured we would like to check it out. we read the reviews and so they were so so but still decided to go  we had a very nice time. service was very good. the food was very good and even the price we figured for such talk about place, at such high end hotel on the strip was also reasonable after all.  granted we only had one appetizer, one pasta dish and one side dish to share among us.  the frito misto (fry calamri, shrimp, fish and vegi) was very delicious and large portion certainly great for 2, perhaps 3 people.   the pasta boulounese was ok very nice but nothing special i coulnt get in little italy around my home. the meat balls were delicious, 2 huge balls perfectly cooked, juicy and just delicious.  add to this a bottle of wine at $60 which was very hard to find among the huge wine selection with most bottles well over the hundreds and one that was just shay of 6k!!!  all in all, we had a very nice dinner, cost us $125 before tip and $150 when it was all said and done. so we didnt try to the most expensive dish's, and can not tell you yelpers how the lamb or steak taste ....but we figured we had a very nice evening, great italian food, dine in an high end restaurant among some high end people and didnt end up paying much more then what we paid every night during our one week vegas stay",

We ended up ordering the shell pasta with ricotta and the shrimp fra diavolo. The shell pasta was not cooked properly, they were very hard. The diavolo sauce was good and spicy but the shrimp was chewy and gross. Also, our waiter wasn't attentive of us like he was to other tables surrounding us. I'm supposing because we are younger (26) but that shouldn't matter since were all paying the same prices, right? Long story short, I left hungry and spent close to $200, total insanity. Do your stomach and pocket the favor and skip out on this place.",

The bus service was the best thing about our eating experience.  He kept the glasses full and put on quite a balancing act taking our half eaten plates away (because the food was terrible). Our server was no help when ordering.  When asked \"what's good?\" We got a generic answer \"well people order it\" as a reply.  Unfortunately we asked to speak with the manager and an adjustment was made to the check.  This did not change anything.  I now have a greater appreciation for the staff and food at my local Olive Garden. Time for a quick recap: don't eat here. Go to Walmart get your sauce, go home, and enjoy.",

Our meal started poorly as they tried to seat our table of 5 in an absolutely insulting spot looking into the kitchen (which looked sort of unkempt).  I told them no way we would sit at this table and after several minutes, they moved us.  Unfortunately, our new table was in the area near the pool and was unbelievably loud and chaotic.   We ordered first courses including the  Caprese salad Green salad and  pasta ala vodka  Each of these dishes was just ok but very expensive and not great food  For our second course (main course), we ordered  Rigatoni Veal Milanese Veal parmigiana   The rigatoni was ok, the veal parmigiana was so-so but the veal Milanese was dry and tasteless as cardboard.   Very disappointing for $50 per main course.   You would think at these high prices you would get fresh made pasta but instead the pasta appeared to be the same packaged stuff we buy at Albertson's.   Table service was so-so with our waiter overloaded with too many tables.  The sommelier was the highlight as she guided up us to two fine bottles of Italian full bodied reds.   I felt cheated after paying our $700 bill. We won't go back to Rao's in Las Vegas because it brings shame to the Rao's name established in East Harlem many years ago.  Rao's in Las Vegas is a rip off and you will be sorry if you go.  There are much better choices at Caesars and across the strip.  I am amazed at some of the reviews on yelp who say this is good Italian food....obviously people who have never had good Italian.",

    "text": "Yelp is right again.  3.5 stars for this place is exactly the meal I got.  I was hoping that most of the low ratings here were based on the \"oh my it's soooo expensive, I can get spaghetti & meatballs at my local mom and pop place back home for $7.50.\"  I hate those reviews.  Yes it's going to be expensive here, you are on the strip and that's why the meatballs are like $16.  They are also the size of softballs.  If I can throw a meatball at you and possibly knock you unconscious ....If we can play dodge ball with it...If I have the urge to put three fingers in it and I'm looking for pins and a lane....If I can chain it to a prisoner's leg and keep him from escaping...If a meatball can do any of those things, then you can charge me $16 for two of them.    Now all of that bragging said, it didn't taste as good as my local mom and pop place back home for $7.50.  Yes I'm that guy.  Tomato sauced based Italian food is comfort food.  Some Italian Grandma has made all these dishes for her whole life and has been taught them by her Grandma and will pass them on to her Grandchildren who will all open restaurants in your cities.  They won't charge you an arm and a leg for them and you will eat them all the time.  They will be really good.  So if I walk into an Italian Restaurant in Caesar's Palace where you need a reservation in advance, I'm going to hold them to a higher standard and I'm expecting to be really wowed.  I wasn't, it was just ok.  For starters we had baked stuffed clams.  These smelled great but the clam was pretty tough to get out of the shell (as clams can be).  The stuffing was way way overdone with fresh oregano.  You could taste nothing else, just oregano bread stuffing. Plus with the clam hanging onto it's shell for dear life, when you scooped out the clam shell, all you got was the stuffing.  The clam was left behind.  2 stars for this appetizer.  My dish was the best at the table, Ossobucco alla Milanese.  I would give it 4 stars.  It was nice and tender shank of veal cut very thick.  It was served on top of saffron risotto and in a traditional tomato/ vegetable sauce.  There was a small fork placed in the bone marrow for sampling.  I enjoyed the flavor of the bone marrow, but I'm not a fan of the texture of it.  If you eat at Rao's, I would recommend this dish.    My brother got a beautiful looking Veal Parmesan.  This was served bone in and was impressive to look at as it covered the entire large plate.  Unfortunately it's flavor didn't match it's looks.  It was also tough.  Not terrible, but not great either...3 stars.    My wife had Ricotta Purses with Sage and Butter.  Although the pasta was cooked nicely, the ricotta cheese was kind of sweet and somehow the sage butter lacked the savory element to offset it.  Just recently we had a similar ravioli style sage butter sauce dish at Angelini Osteria in Hollywood, CA.  That dish was so magical, but this one was very blah.  Again 3 stars.    One other strange bit of info is that Rao's is decorated for Christmas year round.  I asked about this and was told that at the original Rao's in New York, they never got around to taking the Christmas decorations down one year, so it became a joke that they would just leave them up.  When they opened this Las Vegas location, they kept that tradition.  So there you go, as with most restaurants on the strip, Rao's is 3 star food at 5 star prices.",

The real reason to go are the meatballs, which are great, but almost an afterthought at the end of the menu. It's too bad they aren't open for lunch anymore, just to get a meatball sandwich. And I ordered the cannoli just to taste what a $14 cannoli tastes like. And, well, it tastes like a $3 cannoli.    One expects the prices at Vegas's popular spots to be inflated, but, besides the meatballs, this was way too much for decent Italian. $120 for two with one glass of wine.   I would have given it 2.5 stars if I could. This place is mostly hype.",

The disappointment comes with the high expectations of flavor profile and that same profile not being delivered. This place is specifically known for their Meatballs. They are the size of Baseballs you would expect big flavors but unfortunately that didn't happen.",

Finally met up with him this past Saturday for a wonderful meal once again. he was serving a party of 11 and we waiting approx and hour and a half to have him serve us. After tons of drinks at bar waiting, we sat down to eat me and wife and family. WAS WELL WORTH THE WAIT!! Food is great, LEON's service is excellent and far superior to others around.

The Barolo was outstanding, given enough time to breathe first, and the meatballs (veal, beef, pork) ridiculously good (to-die-for good, even). The Spaghetti Bolognese was excellent, and the Taglioline With Peas & Ham was good, but not great. The service was outstanding, including two servers (Matt and Oliver) both from the SF Bay area on the evening when the Giants won the World Series for the 3rd time in 5 seasons. But there were also some duds in the mix -- the seafood salad (calamari, shrimp, lobster, and crab meat) was bland and the veal parmesan was beaten to a rather pizza-like thinness and smothered in mozzarella, delivering a boring consistency.",

    "text": "There's something a little unsettling about going to an Italian restaurant and being told by an angry German man that they won't serve you.  Didn't Mussolini and Hitler form some sort of tag team about denying people what they wanted or some such?  Not that I'm comparing the inability to order a set of damn meatballs to genocide, but I've actually been told I couldn't get food there; nobody's ever tried to shove me into a gas chamber.  Melt me in lava, impale me, throw me off of catwalks that don't meet OSHA standards, wreck my pod racer, and ignite the bio gas coming from the Deathstar's latrines with a bomb, sure.  Here's the deal:  If your website says you are open till midnight every night.....when someone shows up at 11, don't tell them that you closed an hour and a half ago because it was \"a vittle slow\".  It's Vegas - the town never shuts down.  You're telling me that you closed your entire restaurant in a major strip casino 2.5 hours early because you felt like it?  This has happened 2 of the last 3 times we've gone there.    Do these people have ANY idea how hard it is to find parking for the Deathstar?  Those resort parking lots are designed for 9 dollar a day subcompact rentals, not capital spaceships.  And don't even get me started on what happened last time I parked it valet - I'm still paying the fines associated with the planetoid they blew up because they thought the Deathray button was the e-brake.  It takes effort to get to this place.  The worst part is just how unapologetic and rude these people are about it.  Look, I've dined at the Harlem location.  I know that you have to book it half a year in advance and if you don't like it then that's no sweat off of them because....well....you have to book it half a year in advance! But this is a much larger space in a major Vegas resort, and one that I have never seen at more than 20% capacity.  You aren't that damn special.  You aren't afforded the right to be a bunch of jackasses.  You guys are lucky that I had a 50,000 game Keno ticket at Caesar's that I wouldn't have been able to check on had I been thrown out of the casino for Force Choking all of you, otherwise it woulda been the end of all of you.  The food?  It's delicious when you can get it.  The meatballs are literally the best I've had anywhere.  Of course, the Lady Vader has figured out how to perfectly replicate them, so we don't need you for that.  The pasta dishes are delicious, but nothing that can't be easily replaced by venturing about a mile off strip and going to Ferraro's.   The service alone drops this thing all the way down from a solid 4, possibly even a 5, to a 2.  And rest assured, we will NOT be returning to be denied for a 3rd time out of the last 4....which is probably best for the staff's health.    A very sincere \"shove an iLightsaber up your ass\" and a score of 2 Deathstars.",

I'm afraid I really found the food to be bland, the red sauces lacking spice, flavor a bit acidic and or sweet, we had spinach and cheese ravioli, the sauce was on the sweet side, we has a pasta pocket with cranberry and pear with sage, kinda expected to taste a savory flavor, not the case the sage was mostly a leaf in the bowl, and the dish should have been in the dessert selection, just sweet pasta. Had the linguine and clams, large portion, just average needs garlic and shallots or wine or something, took it home to fix it.  Now I must say the meatballs, the size of tennis ball, were very good! Party of 5 and two meatballs were plenty to share and in my opinion the best thing we had. For the price I found the food to be pretty average.  I would not go again, it's a shame because the service staff is top notch!",

We had the antipasto, carrot soup with prawns, meatballs and veal. Everything was excellent. It's not cheap to eat here, but well worth every dime.

But Rao's was another story. All the staff, the host, helper, waiter, food runner, everyone was so kind and personable. The bread was awesome. My husband got the meatballs for an appetizer and he said it was literally the best meatball he's ever had. So tender and they nailed the marinara sauce. He got the Penne Vodka for his meal and completely cleaned the plate. The only complaint was my food, I got the grilled veggies with no butter or oil. It looked as if they had been sitting under the heat light a long time and a few of the veggies (the arugula and something squishy that tasted like licorice) I couldn't even eat because apparently I don't like those at all. But who orders just dry veggies at an Italian place? Probably just a bad choice on my part because everything else was awesome. Thanks for making my husband happy!",

The oysters were delicious but the star of the appetizers was the meatball. It was light and had a great blended taste of pork beef and veal and a great red sauce. The seafood was a mix of shrimp pieces, crab which was not jumbo lump and calamari. It was served cold but did have a nice flavor to it.  Our server was great and made a lot of recommendations and accommodated all of our needs. He even suggested we do more of a family-style with our party so we all got taste of the food.  We had the also buchu linguine with White clam sauce ravioli. My favorite was the ravioli.  The wine selections we made were out of this world but at that caliber of a restaurant I would've expected the sommelier to have a little better pouring technique. I only noticed because he reached across me to pour to the person sitting to the next to me rather than walk around. And he tripped multiple times in front of me almost flashing red wine on to me wearing a tan suit  Other than that it was a nice restaurant and certainly something you can take the family to and was not that formal.  I hear New York is a step up from this location.",

First, I think my experience was different as the service that we received was outstanding.  Our server went out of her way to make sure we were having fun, and made sure the birthday man (my husband) was enjoying his food and his time.  We were seated on time and the first thing I asked for was a drink.  Well, to start off that drink was strong so I thought that this may actually work out well.  We ordered our appetizers and enjoyed them as they were cooked well.  It was nothing special just a caprese salad and some cheesesticks for the others.  We ordered our main course and everyone enjoyed their food.  Was it the best food we have ever, EVER had - no, but it was still delicious and it was piping hot.  The signature lasagna, the rigatoni, and....I actually completely forgot about the others and what they got but I do remember everyone enjoying their meal and saying they should've done without the appetizers.  When we return to Vegas I would love to stay at CP and roll over to Rao's if not for drinks, but the good service we experienced.  Great experience and happy they were cheerful and helping to ensure my husband was enjoying his birthday weekend in Vegas with a few drinks to bid him farewell.",

The first time we ate with another couple, were seated a in comfy booth and we all ordered family style - Salad, Pasta, Lemon Chicken - all of which were PERFECT.   The second time we were joined by my parents who live in NYC and know really good Italian food. The restaurant was extremely busy and we were seated at a table with chairs surrounded by lots of very loud groups of people - not so enjoyable.  I have to say - it was not as good the second time.  We ordered the exact same thing as the first time - and it was just okay (not great). My husband & I just had a late dinner here after the Elton John concert this weekend.  It was fairly good.  We were seated at a dark quiet booth in the back and quickly served.   We started with the stuffed clams - which were delicious - but very tiny - and pricey for the small portion. That followed with a Caesar salad - which was very good and then the penne alla vodka - which was tasty and good - but I felt that it was way over priced at $30!!!  Also - small pours on drinks and wine by the glass.  Would I return?  Yes - I think I possibly would.",

And the spicy red pepper  butter for the bread was also a hit for me. I ordered the Osso Bucco over risotto. Very delicious and a perfect size. This place is pricey but worth it.",

Dr Joe had the Gnocci and Matty had the Sweet Italian Sausage. The service was wonderful, without being stuffy and obtrusive. ( The busboy was HOT!!!) Angelo stopped by and treated us to dessert and after dinner drinks. I highly recommend this experience when in Vegas!",

The portions are huge and the service was great.  I had the Meatball Calzone which looked like a battleship on my plate.  The sauce was spicy and the filling was just right.  My wife had the penne marinara with a meatball side.  The meatballs were the size of baseballs literally.  We closed the meal by sharing a ricotta cheesecake with fresh strawberries.  The cheesecake was light and sweet and the strawberries really highlighted the dish.",

The roasted red peppers with pine nuts and golden raisins is a beautiful start followed by shells with ricotta cheese.  The lemon chicken is ever so tasty!  My hubby adores the veal chop.  The pocketbook pasta stuffed with pear and cheese is a treat.  Desserts are good.  Our young server, John H., was outstanding, very attentive and very informative regarding the food, as well as personable and friendly!  We will definitely ask for John's section for future visits!",

    "text": "First of all, let me say that the proper rating for this restaurant is 3.5 stars: 3 stars for the food, and 4 stars for service. Since good service is much more difficult to find than good food I finally decided to give it a Yelp rating of 4 stars. But I had to think about it for a while.   Actually, I would nearly give it a 5 star rating for service. The staff was unerringly friendly and helpful, and we only had to wait a few extra minutes for our table even though the person who had taken our reservation had failed to note that the leader of our party had requested a prime window seat (which we received, by the way) when taking the reservation. Our waiter met my acid test for service: to wit, after we had received our beverage or food for each round of service (i.e., cocktails, appetizers, main course, etc.) he would stand close by and watch for us to finish or call for him. I had only to look over my shoulder and he would be at my side, awaiting instruction. The service lacked only that extra, almost extrasensory anticipation of need that is the hallmark of a truly great dining experience worthy of 5 stars.   We ordered several appetizers to share. The Mozzarella in Carozza was nice but nothing to write home about. The Fritto Misto di Mare was quite pedestrian. The grilled octopus with broccoli raabi was tasty and nicely cooked, but could have been better seasoned. It was, however, accompanied by some very tasty braised cipollini onions. We also shared a Caesar salad which was . . . how can I put this . . . just a Caesar salad.   I had the grilled lamb chops as a main course (can't remember the Italian name). They were perfectly cooked (I told the waiter to leave the degree of doneness up to the chef, and he did a good job), the meat was of a good quality and presented in a very nice balsamic vinegar reduction, but the accompanying roasted potatoes were pretty nondescript. Our hostess had risotto with shrimp, which was perfectly cooked though unimaginatively seasoned. My friend and his wife split the Salsa alla Marinara and an order of meatballs, subsequently expressing bitter disappointment. The sauce for the pasta was quite average, and the meatballs, while of a nice consistency and heft, were rather bland.   We were quite full by the end of the entrees, and ordered no desserts.   The overall ambiance is simple but attractive. I can think of any number of places I have been to that are just as nice.   The bottom line is that if you come to Rao's expecting a transcendent dining experience, you are bound to be disappointed. Whereas a great deal of the allure of the original Rao's lies in the insane difficulty in getting a table there in the first place, the food at the Rao's in Las Vegas is just of slightly-better-than-any-other-red-sauce-Italian-restaurant quality. Accept this fact, enjoy the ambiance and the service, and you'll have a great time. Expect any more, and prepare to face the awful truth that is dining on The Strip.",

Normally when you show up with a party of 8 or more, if the hostess can find a way to seat you she will do so without seeming to annoyed by it. That was not the case with the hostess on the night we visited. We planned a last min dinner and had 10 people, and expected it to be a stretch to get seated anywhere together. They had several tables available on the front deck of their restaruant but it took them about 20 min to push them together and let us sit down. Again, not a big deal because we had a big party and did not have a reservation. Overall, the food was really good but it seemed like our whole meal the hostess was staring us down and the waiters were not so happy about our party size... if its such a big issue just say no next time!",

The waiter was really nice, but maybe trying too hard.  There's waiters who you can tell are actually funny and having a good time, and others who sound like their first night on stage at a comedy club - complete bomb.  anyways, we ordered the new york steak, salmon, and veal.  everything was drenched in olive oil.  i'm sure it was a high quality evoo, but everything pretty much tasted the same - olive oil with tomatoes and capers.  the new york steak was by far the best dish.  A good cut of beef.  veal was okay, and the salmon with crispy skin would have been good had it not been of the overly sour tomato sauce and overabundance of capers (or whatever those were).  Maybe we just ordered the wrong items, but we not not impressed with Rao's at all in terms of food.  Being in Vegas and at Caesars, we knew what the price tag was going to be.  So \"value\" didn't even figure into the 2 star rating.",

For my entree, I had the lemon chicken, which lives up to its incredible reputation. It was stunning.  We shared a plate of veal scalopini which was underwhelming, but above average, and the prosciutto which accompanied the dish was buttery fantastic.  And, yes, we ordered a bunch of meatballs which were amazing.  My Dad makes incredible veal, pork meatballs, and I felt the love in the Rao's composition. Special.  The pasta was, naturally beautiful and cooked to perfection.    Because of its popularity with East-Coasters, I recommend getting a reservation as soon as possible.  I was here on Labor Day and it was booked, I had to bribe my way in, but it was worth it.   Recommended.",

No lettuce, just all fresh calamari, shrimp, lobster, crab!  Pasta is great. Portions were always huge and we would take leftovers to our hotel refridge for later.  I've downgraded Rao's to 3 stars as they have really shrunk the portion sizes and especially the outstanding veal chop. Still tastes great but it is about half the size of what it used to be and quite fatty.  This has been the same over the last two visits and our waiter agreed with us. Of course price hasn't shrunk.

Maybe with the jealousy in play, my expectations were higher than they should have been, but I would have thought that for the price and expectations, the service and experience would have been a bit better.  First was the table - round tables, especially for large groups, suck.  We were crammed into the table, our feet kicking one another and having to eat like we were preying mantises (think of eating with your elbows glued to your sides).    Second was the service - for a $$$$ restaurant take the ladie's orders first and keep track of who ordered which dish so that we aren't shuffling food around when it is served.  Third was the appetizers - the waitress recommended family style and in a compromise we decided to have a bevy of appetizers to share.  However, for a restaurant that recommended family style they were impossible to serve and cut up.  Fourth was the drinks - excellent drinks but sheesh this is Vegas, keep them coming!  Be attentive!  Now the goods - great food.  I had a veal with salad peppers (gave it a little kick) that was unlike anything I have had before and tasted excellent.  I also had a great apple tart dessert which achieved great balance.  So many desserts are excessively sweet and rich these days; it's nice to have one that is lighter, not so sweet, and showcases the flavors of the ingredients.  Also, the portions were well defined.  By no means did I leave hungry, but I was able to have dessert and leave without feeling like a glutton.  I ate everything that I would have wanted to.",

My wife and I have come here in Vegas and choose Rao's as a place to celebrate our Anniversary the last few years. Well, we had dinner this past Saturday night (11/19/2011) and I am sad to say we'll not be coming back anytime soon.  To start with, while we were seated in one of our favorite booths, there was a large group of diners (dressed in shabby jeans, t-shirts and jerseys) seated close by that were beyond loud, even by Vegas standards. I mean loud, disruptive, vulgar and screaming to a point that everyone in the place was disgusted. While this can happen anywhere, the management of the place did nothing, even the wait staff complained to us about them. They finally left and were replace by an equally loud and obnoxious group.   The atmosphere was so bad, my wife and I decided to speed up our meal. The meal arrived and it was not up to the Rao's level of the past... I dare say verging on awful. We skipped desert finished our bottle of wine and got the bill only to find drinks added to it that was not ours at all. While the bill was adjusted, it seemed to be a topper to an awful dining experience at what was one of our favorite places to com e each time we visited Las Vegas.",

    "text": "We were disappointed by the food.  We had a table out back, on the pool side of the restaurant (the pool at Caesars is just beyond), and although the interior was fine, and the service was \"okay\" the food was really disappointing.  Not up to standards for this price range or for a \"signature restaurant\" at Caesars.    We were a group of 4, one vegetarian, the rest not.  The octopus salad was oily and not very interesting, the fried calamari downright bad, and the main dishes not much better.    I had the gnocchi, and it could have come from a boxed mix.  One diner had the orrecchiette with broccoli rabe, which wasn't bad, just not very creative.    The simple pasta with tomato sauce was equally uninspiring.  The meatballs were boring, not what you would expect from an \"anchor\" Italian restaurant at Caesars.  We often stay at Caesars or at least visit to gamble when in town (we're also big fans of staying at the Venetian/Palazzo), but we will not be back to Rao's when there are so many better dining options in Vegas.",

I made the reservation and asked to sit somewhere with a view. To my surprise they listened! From our seats we had a great view of the pool which gave us something to look at during dinner.  As for the food we started with the calamari. It was good but I wouldn't say it was the best I've ever had. The breading was coming off and the portion was not family style. The wine list was safe and we did find something that was tasty without being too pricey. For my meal I had the risotto, I loved it. However, I could have done without the carrots. My girlfriend had the manicotti and she said it was good but not great. The service was fair. It was odd that there were so many workers running around but it took a good while before we got our first drink. But after the drinks came to the table, the service did improve. Bottom line, Rao's is a great place to take a group of people if you want a nice meal, good atmosphere, and you don't to mind paying $17.00 for calamari.",

We mentioned this to our waiter and told him that Frankie Jr. waited on us. He said that Frankie was here and he went to get him. He came right over to our table and we began to reminisce about the New York restaurant.  He was kind enough to give us an amazing dessert platter and after dinner drinks on the house!  The food was fantastic. We had the pork chops and rigatoni filetto di pomodoro. Definitely among the best meals in Vegas!",

I wasn't impressed with my meal, unfortunately, and maybe it was due to the food I ordered.  After being meat-ed out from a steakhouse visit the prior night, I was in the mood for seafood, so I ordered a house salad and a mussel special of the night.  The $15 house salad was a huge platter of basically iceberg lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and fennel.  I should have ordered the beet salad as my friend did.  The entrees came out on a cart and are served table-side which is a nice touch.  My $35 special was some spaghetti with an average tomato sauce and mussels, some of which were still sandy.  I was not impressed.  However, I tried one of my friends meat balls and those were very good.  I don't mind paying for a good meal but the food at least has to be good.  Too many other options in Vegas... I won't be back.",

    "text": "Wanted to try this little place since I probably wasn't going to get a table in Harlem! There is something about a place that is basically booked all year every year! Well this place did have a little attitude.... the hostess told me there was no seats available except for the bar as it is first come first serve. As I passed by an open table i checked out the bar which was packed  with only 1 bartender for about 20 guests. As i was going to ask about the free table the hostess  was now seating another couple there. I was a little perturbed and told her there were no seats.... she said she didnt know how long it wold be, and then she  asked what i wanted to eat. How about the pasta I said? To my surprise she then began to list a few places to go! Well i came out  to try  that \"goodfella attitude\" anyway!  I told her we came here to try this place and she just said.... \"oh\"  .....well I guess they have their own way to handle things! Anyway after another couple tried to hawk down a free table (saved by our waiter) we got a seat. This place is just a no frills Italian eatery with wonderful simple sauces (vodka and a san marzano tomato)  and al dente pasta. Im sure the atmosphere and friends made this a hangout joint for all the Sopranos in NYC! Here its kinda like a classic place that you must try, but you will probably find better food for the price. My lunch for 2....  and no drinks (ice tea) was $85.00. However I like old school places and sometimes a \"Tommy's  Chili burger\" can really hit the spot over an \"angus prime beef burger\" at the four seasons !! But as opposed to here the Tommy burger is waaaayyy cheaper!",

With reservations at Rao's, I was set for a night of deliciousness. We sat down quickly, and had an assorted bread basket at our table shortly after (olive oil, but no balsamic vinegar. Still a nice touch though!). I ordered the veal, and it was perfect. Thin slices, just the right amount of sauce, and flavour that was flavourful without being overpowering. We ordered the dessert trio for dessert (get that!) - chocolate cake, and a couple of others that I was too full to remember. Nice service, and a quiet spot in the busyness that is Caesars during conference season!",

Hundreds of dollars later, the only nice thing I have to say about Rao's is that the service was great and the ambiance is nice (Although Christmas-y.  In August.) but everything else?  Pass.    This is what we had:   Caprese Salad-  Weird.  The tomatoes were in huge quarters instead of slices and there was a pesto/garlic/balsamic sauce all over it.  The cheese was delicious but the rest?  Not so much.    Caesar Salad-  Not bad, but nothing to write home about.    Salsa alla Marinara and a Side of Meatballs-  My husband had this dish and didn't dislike it, but didn't think it was anything great either.  I tried the meatballs in some marinara, and I'm not going to lie...there was an acidic, I-just-puked-in-my-mouth aftertaste that I couldn't shake.  Needless to say, I've had better meatballs.  And sauce.    Porcini Mushroom Risotto- I really thought this dish was going to blow my mind.  The menu lists it as:  \"Vialone Rice Cooked with Mushroom Stock, Sliced Porcini Mushrooms, Parmesan Cheese, and White Truffle Oil\".  What it actually is though is a different story:  Simultaneously mushy and hard rice with bland mushrooms, and an overwhelming truffle oil scent with a underwhelming truffle oil taste.  The busboy knew I didn't like it and offered to tell my server, but what is she going to do about it?  She didn't make it.  I'm just bummed we paid $30 for a dish I took five bites of.  Overall, the place has potential, the service is great (I mean, a guy comes out and dishes your plates in front of you!), but it didn't do anything for our wallets or our stomachs.",

As an appetizer I got Cesar salad which was good just the dressing was a little lighter than I prefer. We also got an order of meatballs which were great. The meatballs were ever so soft and the red sauce complimented them. As for dinner I had a tough choice. I went with the veil parmesan. Boy was I glad I did. It was perfect. The veil was very tenor and the breading was just the right amount of crisp. Just the right amount of cheese melted. For dessert we finished off with the tirimasu, it was awesome. The tirimasu had just the right amount of softness with a cool espresso taste. I would definitely recommend this place and will be coming back when I visit vegas gain or if I can ever get into the New York one.",

Only had one piece of fish and the zucchini was so thin you couldn't grab it with your the pronged fork. Still tasty. He loved the veal parm and said it was the best he'd had.  I don't care for veal so I stuck with pasta. We would definitely return again.  Service was impeccable from hostesses to wait staff. For two of us it cost $175 with tip including two drinks.  Next time we'll share an entree, the meatballs and get a dessert. Vegas hotels don't have microwaves to reheat leftovers.",

This place is Italian through and through, and of course I'm talking about the food.  It's located inside Caesar's Palace, near the buffet and the pool.  Truthfully, you could probably eat here cheaper for dinner than you can at the buffet.  I remember asking about the dinner price at the buffet, and it was $51 per person.  They start you off with a large bread basket here, which has a wide assortment of breads.  We even had some olive oil to dip our bread in.  It was very good.  I split a caesar salad with my wife, and it's a good thing because it was way too much for one person.  For my main course, I ordered the lasagna.  Once again, a huge portion.  I could barely even finish half of it.  It was good, but certainly not the best lasagna I've ever had.  Either way, I was plenty full.  My wife had a penne vodka type dish.  I tried a few bites and it was excellent.  I think I'll consider getting her dish the next time.  There are several other things I'd like to try on the menu (meatballs), but they'll just have to wait.  Just like most of the restaurants at Caesar's Palace, this place is pretty pricey.  Two people could eat here for less than $100, if you don't order alcohol.  It's worth it in my book, though.  I had absolutely no room for dessert, so I can't comment on that.  I look forward to coming back here again in the future.",

We loved the food so much - we cleaned our plates. Even the green beans and potatoes were just right.  It's expensive no doubt, but it's not to be missed.",

    "text": "Not bad, but not great for the money spent.   I read a few reviews here on Yelp before and after I went to Rao's. I had to confirm what I had read to be accurate. Among the situations other Yelper's have listed, such as being told they are fully booked or that they they don't have a particular bottle wine (due to the lower price of the bottle..) I can tell you both of these things happened to myself and my party.   We originally tried to make a reservation for 8 pm on a Friday and were told there was absolutely no way that would be possible for 3 people. The reservationist directed us to come in and sit at the bar if we liked and we could wait for a table to open up for dining. This is what we decided to do.   We strolled in just before 8 pm to a crowded bar at Rao's. My female companion inquired at the door about a table for 3. We wanted to be thorough in case a cancellation or something of the sort had occurred. The young hostess assured us there was no way we would be seated in the dining room before 930 p.m. We decided to go to the bar for a drink. Sitting at the bar, the room was fairly full. As I turned to look at the dining room, I saw 7 empty tables. All clean, prepped and ready to go. At 830, then 845, still no one sitting in them. Close to 9 pm we are seated to a half empty dining room. ... ...   So we sit down and my one buddy has been here before including the one in New York. He did the ordering of food. I ordered wine. Figuring the 3 of us would drink at least 2 bottles of wine throughout dinner.. (we like wine:) I decided on a $80-ish bottle of Montepulciano. The server came by to tell us that the wine was unavailable and suggested a $95 dollar bottle instead. I told him I would check the menu a bit and get back to him. Im not afraid of a $95 bottle of wine, but the review I had read was ringing in my ears.. so I decided on a $70-ish bottle instead... ALSO unavailable. So when I decided to go to the $95 dollar bottle .. they had it practically ready to pour! Haha.. It was almost comical.   The sommelier came by and was pouring wine as the first course of beet salad was arriving. I was serving the salad to my friends and was told by the sommelier that I \"do that very well\"..I said thanks, I am in the service industry also.   \"Oh we didn't know you were service industry too\"... she said.. Hmm. Why does that matter I thought?  Overall.. I have to tell you i was so unimpressed with the whole situation, that I just smiled, ate and ordered more wine. I gotta say.. the food was really unimpressive. My main gripe about 'American Style' Italian food is the over abundance of sauce, and lack of flavor.. in a high-end place like Rao's.. I would have expected that to be a non-issue. Not so. Really bland Sausage and Broccoli Rabe, unflavored red sauce on a couple of meatballs, and really just non existent on anything over the top delicious. Aside from the bottle of Ripasso I had in place of dinner, as I stopped dining after a few bites. Just not good.   The bartenders at the bar were very nice, smiling and made a great martini. It was a saving bit to the evening as they even smiled and wished us good night as we left. It was around $300 for the 3 of us, and is probably near average per person price, but far less than average dining experience. Sorry. Better luck to you if you try this out. I won't be back for dinner.",

    "text": "Meatballs are otherworldly but otherwise not a great experience.  My wife made a reservation here to try their meatballs, and they did not disappoint. Fantastic combination of beef, pork, and veal that give a buttery texture and fantastic flavor.    The downside is that we ordered too much food.  The pasta dishes are entree sized, which would be good to explain, as traditional Italian restaurants with multiple courses typically downsize the portions so you can enjoy all courses.  Our pastas (Shells with Ricotta and Spaghetti Bolognese) were very, very good, but simply too much food.    We compounded our error by ordering a single entree to share (Osso buco), and this was good.  Just good, not great.    It this was the whole story, then my summary would be high quality food but overpriced and portions were too large.  Unfortunately, we then had an incident with a server dropping a plate with marinara sauce near our table, and the associated shrapnel hitting my wife and myself.  Initially, it did not seem that bad, and the first response was for an employee to come with a stain stick and club soda.  The first response was quick and helpful, and the employee who dropped the plate came to apologize (mistakes happen, don't sweat it), but eventually it was clear that the sauce had really hit my wife's blouse and pants pretty badly, and by this time, the waiter had brought our check with no adjustment but a comp dessert (which we were too full to eat).  The lady with the stain stick then just left us an almost empty one because \"she was too busy\".      Eventually (with no complaint or prompting by us) the manager did in fact make things right comping the meal, which we appreciated, but this or something similar should have been done as soon as it was clear that the problem was as bad as it was. Bringing us a $200 check and running my AMEX was unnecessary, even when the bill was credited eventually.  The manager did offer to take care of dry cleaning but we were leaving the following day so that would not work.  She did give us her card and invited us back, which was appreciated.  Bottom line, it's expensive, but the meatballs are among the best I have ever experienced and the food is very good - just don't order too much.  Our waiter (Jimmy) was outstanding and I think he was a little embarased that management did not move more quickly, but like us he was satisfied that they made it right (and we did tip Jimmy anyway).  What I really hope is that they did not fire the server who dropped the plate.  Mistakes happen - they just look worse with red sauce.",

The staff truly try to make this experience unique, and the food speaks for itself. They handled my table of 7 perfectly and we left stuffed and happy.   The pasta really shines at Rao's and I don't know how fresh it truly is, but it tastes like they're making it for every dish. I included pictures of what the dishes were looked like before we finished them. Eating here brought me back to Italy, and the great food you can find everyday there.  For appetizers we ordered the Fritto Misto and Meatballs. I don't know what they do to these meatballs to make them taste this good but I wanted to order another as my main dish.    Favorite entree was the Ricotta Purses and they shined! Warm ricotta filling, with a rich sweet butter sauce. This a must.  The Lemon Chicken is very citrus-y and be warned it's too overwhelming for some. The chicken is grilled perfectly though.",

    "text": "Do not waste your time or money going to Raos. This is bad pedestrian type Italian food. My veal chop was so pre cooked and then microwaved and not even microwaved properly at that. It was barely Luke warm. 23.00 for a plain bowl of ziti with maranara sauce. I would be fine with that if everything else was acceptable but it certainly was not.  I know good Italian food, I used to eat lunch at a little joint in Hillside NJ called M&M Pizzaria run by a guy called Vito. He made the best Eggplant in the world, and I mean it. I order eggplant wherever I travel to and none have come close. Good Italian food does not have to be at a big fancy restaurant, Vito rates up there with the best of them including Il Mulino's, il Gabianos etc. That is in certain dishes, for the basics Vito can't be beat. Which is more than I can say about Raos! It was the second worst meal I had in Vegas and in the top 10 worst I had in my life, for a $162.00 no less. The worst meal was Aureole at the Mandalay, it was completely unedible and the manager would not even charge us after what I can only assume tasting some of the dishes that were served to us.  We each returned our original main course selections and then the manager graciously offered to make us different second dishes which were worst than the first dishes.   It was so very disappointing since the restaurant as a whole is beautiful and the Swan room is a special place. So you sit there expecting greatness and end up with an Olive Garden meal gone bad, no make that a Sabaro's meal gone bad. Raos came in a close second just to put  it in perspective how bad it is.  My theory on dinning holds True. Number one if you walk into a Restaurant during prime time and it's not packed it's a good bet the food is not good, second if you walk into a gourmet restaurant and they serve you cold bread it's a good bet the food is not good. If you encounter either of these situations do yourself a favor and get up and leave.  This place doesn't even deserve 1 star but Yelp won't let you post unless you select at least one star. Aureole is a negative 5 star.",

Please keep in mind my main meal the \"quattro formaggio\" is listed under the 'sides' section of the menu.  Two orders of baked clams were ordered as appetizers (at $19.00 each). For dinner entree 2  people order spaghetti  and shrimp ($38.00 each)  and other friend ordered spaghetti ($26.00) and a side of meatballs ($18.00) That's  $44.00 for spaghetti and meatball folks LOL!.

But then after waiting over a half hour, we finally get seated, and then reality hit! Rao's is great if you have no sense of taste and love bland food. They are known for their meatballs so a few of us ordered those. Let me tell you, the meatballs in the frozen section at the supermarket were better. Very bland. The lasagna? Again, not the worst I have ever had but very far from the best. Again, the ladies at the local church make better pasta dishes than Rao's and their lasagna does not cost $30. But the worst of the meal was the peas, onions and prosciutto.  What were they thinking? The  prosciutto was so tasteless! How do you make it so bland?   Anyhow if you are thinking of eating at Rao's, don't. If you want to spend big bucks on a meal in Vegas, go over to the Bellagio and try their buffet, the locals love it. Or try FireFly Tapas over on Paradise Rd. I'm a foodie that's been coming to Vegas for 10 years. Don't waste your money here, unless of course, you enjoy spending big money on food with no flavor at all.",

The only interest she held was sneezing into her hands and then touching our glasses and plates.  NO charisma, no class and they weren't working to please their customers at all.     The restaurant is uncomfortable.   We were led down the stairs to an area that looks out to the pool.   The front of the restaurant that had cozy looking booths and intimate table were passed up and we were placed in the middle of the walk way between the kitchen/service area and other tables!!    There were people constantly brushing up against our backs and the seats are very small and have very little butt space.   The pad of the chair is short and narrow.   The odd thing is, there weren't any customers we when came in the front part of the restaurant, so they could have sat us there.  Also, the sun was beating down on us and there wasn't any shade given so we had to eat with the sun in our eyes.   This has been hands down the most uncomfortable restaurant experience in Las Vegas so far.     The atmosphere distracted us from the food and dining experience.  Lastly, the dessert menu was unimpressive.    Standard Italian desserts.  This place has great food but lousy service and ambience, which will turn people away.",

I ordered the Chicken Scarpariello, and had the meatballs as well. Raos probably made the best meatballs I ever had, even though they were a bit on the pricy side for only two meatballs. The meatballs were pretty big, and very rich in flavor as well as very moist. The Chicken Scarpariello was on the bone, so I'm not the biggest fan, but very juicy and moist as well. Also had a bit of my friends pasta, which was cooked perfectly al-dente. Certainly a good experience to try something a bit different than Chicken Parmesan all the time.  PROS *Service - Our waiter was fantastic, and very knowledgeable about everything in Las Vegas and was even telling us about how he used to be a professional poker player. Very casual dining experience and good pacing for bringing out our food.  *Atmosphere - Really cool place facing out to the pool. Our waiter told us that their was some sort of modeling event going on during that week, so you can get a great view if you come out during the day most likely.   CONS *Food Options - I didn't want my chicken on the bone, but that was the only option we had. Couldn't get grilled chicken added to a pasta or onto a salad, so that was a bit disappointing. Not to say the food was bad, because it wasn't, it's just that I wish Rao's could have had some more choices to eat from.",

On this last visit we had excellent steamed mussels in a butter and garlic broth, my brother in law raved about his eggplant parm, we shared an excellent and refreshing garden salad with a traditional oil and vinegar dressing...heavy hand on the vinegar but we both like it that way.  I have excellent Linguine in a white clam sauce....very plentiful on the chopped clams!  The butter and lavosh are killer good.  The atmosphere is great if you know the story of Rao's in East Harlem....do a little reading on it before you judge the interior,  It's lively, load and fun....great service!  Walk out to see the bocce court.",

That's not acceptable- you should be treating all parties that dine in your restaurant equally.  *FOOD: The food was good, except for what I ordered.  What we ordered overall: -2 seafood salads -2 caesar salads -1 veal dish -1 penne vodka -1 order of meatballs -lots of drinks  I had the Penne a la Vodka. Way too dry and tasteless. The seafood salad was delicious and the meatballs were to die for! Seems as if the dishes were one way or the other: GREAT or totally disappointing.  *INTERIOR/AMBIANCE: We were sat 4 to a booth and it was a bit cramped, but I didn't mind because I loved the ambiance of the restaurant. It would be a great place for a romantic dinner although it was L O U D. Very loud. I loved the low key lighting and the traditional, classy yet cosy feel of the place.  *OVERALL: I will say that this establishment is not worth the price (in terms of food quality + consistency). That said, I do understand that anything on the Strip is overpriced. I would come back, but only to order specific items. Enjoyed the ambiance.",

We quickly learned that what we are used to as food portions, in Vegas, all bets are off.  We shared the mozzarella in carrozza and the roasted beet salad.  Can't begin to describe the flavour and excellence of these dishes.  Truley awesome.  We went on to share penne alla vodka and the risotto.  The penne were fantastic and risotto, while it was very good, too much mushrooms in our opinion.  It was good but risotto should not be overpowered by the additions.  Still very good.  Strongly recommend the experience!!!!1",

After sitting down and ordering a nice bottle of wine my family and I preceded to sip our wine and figure out what we were going to eat. We each only ordered a pasta dish (due to our indulgence at breakfast and lunch). The wine expert or sommelier ... not sure... made us feel comfortable and not rushed at all, we felt welcome to enjoy ourselves. We finally told the server our order which consisted of the spaghetti, the pear pasta, and the rigatoni I believe. After ONLY about 3-4 minutes our food came out, revealing that it was pre-made and probably heated up. The busboy transferred our food from a heat saving dish to our plates in front of us. After tasting our food it was OKAY. It wasn't bad but it also was nothing to rave about. The only other italian place I have eaten in Vegas is Carmine's which is located in the Forum shops of Caesars and I would 100% say it is tastier. I am sure there is much better, more authentic italian food that is not pre-made found all over Vegas. I would not recommend Rao's to anyone visiting Las Vegas.",

Plan on ordering several dishes to share because that was part of the joy of dining there.  You can also buy their spaghetti sauce there and RAO's sauce is sold in some Whole Foods supermarkets and online.  We also ordered a couple of bottles of high end wines.

After hearing how hard it is to get into the original restaurant in NYC (there's only 8 tables, and you need to know someone who knows someone - you get the point), we decided that we would get a taste of Italy in Las Vegas.  The dinner was a Pre-Fixe Menu that had 3 choices of appetizers, pasta, meat, and dessert for $160 - it also came with a glass of Champagne or a Bellini. I chose the Caprese Salad, Risotto with fresh veggies, Surf and Turf (9 oz filet and 7 oz lobster tail), and we all shared the 3 desserts (the best was the tiramisu).  The wait staff was superb, and the meal was very good - but as with most Italian restaurants, there was a LOT of food.  After the salad and risotto, I was already starting to get full, then the main courses came, and they were delicious, but about half way through, I was done.  My wife had the Ossobuco, which was amazing, and super tender.  When dessert was being served, we all needed espresso to kick us out of a food coma, and get us ready for the rest of the night...  The best part of the evening was that Frank Peligrino (the owner - also a star in The Sopranos) was there, and we took photos - he also sang in the Live Band that played from 10 until we brought in the New Year.  Most of the crowd in the restaurant wandered out to the private patio and watched the fireworks display over the Strip - it was awesome, and very LOUD, as the explosions echoed off the buildings at Caesar's Palace.  Overall, it was a great night, and if I had a bigger appetite, then I would have rated the entire experience 5-stars!",

And buy the homemade sauce firsthand, that three days ago, i picked up from a dominick's in chicago!  Jokes aside, i thought this was a great place. Maybe it had to do with the fact that it was a private hosted reception, and i got to meet the chef and the las vegas owners, the pellegrino sons, and maybe it helped that drinks were on the house.  But the history of this place is amazing. And they really look after you while you're eating here. Minute attention to detail, unobtrusive omnipresence (oxymoron time!) - i mean it; our server had a way of refilling our water, topping off the wine glasses, and bringing fresh bread without seeming to hover.  I got the ravioli, and it was great. Their sommelier does a pretty good job of walking you through the options without being forceful, so all in all, the meal was great.  Caveat, this was pretty pricey. But for an experience that you're not likely to repeat every week, might be worth a visit.",

    "text": "We arrived on a Saturday night with a group of five. We asked to have a seat on the patio and they said they are only serving inside at the moment at 7:30pm... It was extremely dark in here to the point that another table was using the light on their phone to see the menu. The decor is a bit tacky with plates that look like they are 40 years old. My silverware was dirty and my plate had a noticeable chip in it. Out of the 100's of pictures on the wall I would make a guess to say that around 90% of them were crooked.  Staff: The hostess and waiter were friendly and attentive. None of our bread plates were cleared from the table the whole time we were there. The manager sat down at everyones table but ours. He was earnest with other guests explaining the menu but never once even acknowledged us. Being as we had the largest group in the room and one open seat he could of at least made an attempt. One of the waiters in a red vest was visibly drunk or on some type of drug. He was not able to walk straight and was smiling so hard while staring over our table it was extremely uncomfortable. An old creepy camera guy was walking around the room while hugging his camera?.. One of the staff was throwing a crap ton of silverware in a drawer which was obviously loud and disruptive with no consideration whatsoever.   Food: The food is average and costs about $40 a plate. We were going to get a bottle of wine but once I saw that a $30 bottle was marked up at $80+ we passed. I ordered filet mignon and asked for it medium rare. It came out well done.  Conclusion: Pass. This is Vegas.. There are a lot better places for the price and service we received.",

Okay.... we finally found it and were ushered to our seats. It was Christmas time and an annoying bell ringing music was quite prominent. We thought it might be coming from a musical wreath but no, it was coming from an iPad at the table closest to us. Their young daughter was playing a game on an iPad with the singing blasting out. At the next table s boy was flipping his forks all over the table and floor for a laugh. We asked to be moved, which they did thank you) to a section on the lower floor. The food was mediocre and the glass of wine was $28.00. The service was good. It's nothing like the Rao's in New York. I think this is off our future restaurant visits. I believe Joe's StoneCrab and Steak is a much better place to drink and dine.",

Even before the meal itself was served, our server recommended several wines, and the additional bread came with a variety of butter spreads and extra virgin olive oil.

With that said, I decided to try the next best thing: a dinner reservation at Rao's, inside of Caesars Palace.  Our group of 6 got a dinner reservation via OpenTable for July 4th. While the ambience & atmosphere of Rao's was very warm and welcoming, the food didn't blow me away like what I thought it would. The Chicken Caesar salad lacked originality and for almost $20, looked like one of those salads found in the MDR on a Norweigan Cruise Line. I ordered the Spaghetti Alla Bolognese. While the dish tasted fine (almost like Olive Garden quality), nor my nose or mouth was tantalized by the lukewarm dish that was served.  I loved the interior decorations of the place and even the red door entrance looks like the mother ship restaurant in New York. Sadly I was disappointed by the food here, especially when I had ultra-high expectations for a chapter of Rao's. While I will hold out hope that someday I will receive that exclusive invitation to eat at Rao's in New York, I will avoid this Las Vegas location for the near future.",

We started with the Meatballs app, along with the variety of table breads and a bottle of Caymus. Immediately, my colleagues and I knew this would be a special night. The meatballs were so tender and flavorful. The Caprese Salad with Burrata Cheese was so fresh and taste bud bursting. I had an opportunity to try a little bit of the Chicken Parmesan, Pan Seared Pork Chop, Chicken Scarpariello and Spaghetti Carbonara. All of these plates had their own signature taste and each were wonderful. This place \"hit it out the park\" with me tonight and so glad I was able to enjoy it this week.",

I ordered the Lobster Bisque to start which was the special, unfortunately it had been under the heat lamp so long that it developed a thick layer of film when I went to mix it...and I mean thick.  Very salty...  Next came the Liguine with clams...this is an Italian restaurant right???? Well the linguine was undercooked...I'm not even kidding.  The noodles were not cooked.  To make matters worse the white wine sauce was tasteless and clams were barely average.  How is this even possible??? Amateur cooks can do better.  Took a few bites and had enough.   My girlfriend got the Ravioli and she said it tasted like something from a Chef Boyardee can.  Absolutely underwhelming.  I had another course coming but by this point I was so upset that I got the bill, paid for it and left.    The bill for me alone came to over $65 USD.  This had to have been the worst meal I've had in years.    To make matters worst the outside chef that was organizing everything seemed annoyed I had said the meal was awful.  He didn't look to make anything right.    Avoid this place.  Edit: reading the reviews here is laughable.  I cannot believe there is such a massive difference in experiences.  Nothing we had or sampled from other plates at the table was worth any hype.",

MEATBALLS.  =====================  Four stars is a great restaurant for me, but my experience here was truly worth five. We came here for my husband's birthday recently. There was nothing that I wish would have been done differently.  One of the most noticeable things was that every single person we had an interaction with on staff was so friendly. It's clear there is a dedication to customer service there.  We went on a Friday evening, made a reservation on Open Table, and although it wasn't completely full (no one was using the tables outside of the entrance), the back was fairly full. We did not feel cramped on other diners, though.  Our waiter was patient and attentive, suggesting but not pushing complimentary dishes to what we were ordering. He smiled when we said we HAD to try the meatballs! What blows my mind is how quickly the food came out. I truly don't care how it was prepared (I mean, of course I do), but it was LIGHTNING QUICK. We honestly thought it was for the table next to us. The runner who brought our food out made light of his job and made us chuckle by asking us, \"Would you like some cheese on your cheese?\" (Parmesan)  My husband had a full belly and loved all our choices: Beef Lasagna, Eggplant Parm, Ricotta Shells, MEATBALLS, Cabernet. IF YOU DON'T WANT TO TRY THE MEATBALLS YOU PROBABLY HATE PUPPIES, TOO, DON'T YOU?! Wonderfully delightful. All these choices made for full bellies for two, for reference.  Next on my list: To visit again and try one of their desserts. We were just too full!",

This is the culinary equivalent of Giuseppe coming out of the kitchen, kicking me in the groin, and then expecting me to pay for the experience. Come on Rao's, it's just chicken and pasta. The rest of the menu is presented in the same spirit: decent food with small portions at astronomical prices. Let me be clear, I am not a miser, but Rao's is severely lacking in value and they certainly don't have a lock on the Italian fare in the area. Maybe management isn't aware of this, but this is Las Vegas...there are other options on the strip.",

We had an early dinner so we weren't that hungry. The two of us shared fritto misto, caprese salad and crab carbonara. It was very filling, they have a pretty decent serving. Will definitely come back to try their other pasta when I'm in Vegas again!",

What I didn't know was that going to one in New York City was practically impossible and I am better off trying my luck at their other locations.   When planning my trip to Vegas, I made sure to put Rao's on the itinerary! This restaurant was nothing short of amazing, delicious and definitely worth the hype. The meatballs were probably some of the best, if not the best, meatballs I've had. I can't even describe how delicious they tasted, they seriously melt in your mouth - paired with the robust Rao's marinara?! man oh man... I kid you not I shed tears at the table!   The entrees were shared were delicious as well - Lamb Shank and Linguine with Clams but nothing beat the meatballs. I'm going back next time I am in a Vegas off the strength of that alone. I'm big on quality italian food having italian family members and THIS is it. Wave Olive Garden goodbye!",

    "text": "If you haven't been to Rao's yet, it's a MUST ! A larger replica of the original in New York, (haven't yet been to the one they opened up locally in Los Angeles) this quaint Italian restaurant has legit QUALITY Italian food, great atmosphere, impeccable service and not to mention a pretty fabulous wine list.   Rao's is located inside of Caesars Palace hotel. We typically make reservations to avoid the disappointment of it being too crowded to get a table. The back area that faces the hotel pool has a lovely view, and the interior sections (that actually replicate the tiny original restaurant in NY) are slightly less lit, but still with a great ambience and additional intimacy. We're happy no matter where we sit !   The menu here is simplistic and just absolutely delicious. My fiance says the Linguine Carbonara is HANDS DOWN the best he's ever had (even compared to multiple spots in Italy!) and I'm never disappointed with any of their seafood pasta dishes (or wine !). You can expect to spend north of $100 for two (with drinks). Not a bad price for many of the restaurants in Vegas !   This was our third time back, it has absolutely become a staple when we visit LV - and truly can't recommend it enough!!",

You come in to the bar area. There are 2 dining rooms off the bar that are old school Italian. Dark heavy wood with signed celebrity photos covering the walls. Reminded me a lot of Palm Restaurant also in Caesars (same decorator???). The 4th room is bright and airy with glass walls. Based on the reviews, we went with the meatballs ($19) as an app. Then the Scarpariello ($36) as the entree. With the rave reviews for the meatballs, the bar was set pretty high. Tough to impress when you expect something that good. It was OK, but nothing special. The scarpariello was really exceptional. A huge dish with lots of dark meat chicken, sausage, peppers and more. So why only 4 stars when the food, service and ambiance were really good. Because they charge $18 to park your car. I was staying at the hotel so I didn't have an extra charge for the meal. But I will never come back and be hit with an $18 surcharge to dine at a restaurant. Clearly, the folks who run Caesars have no interest in dining business from locals.",

This fried cheese was wonderful. Came with marinara. I've had fried cheese before but this was the best ever! The chicken in the Chicken Parmesan had a buttery flavor that made it soooo good. The meatballs were soft and the meat just crumbled and melted in our mouths! I must say though, Oscar was right about the Penne Vodka. It was the best thing of the meal. We went around our anniversary and I had mentioned that when making the reservation. We received a little scoop of vanilla ice cream with some fruit for free! We probably could have split a meal as the portions were on the larger size. Loved the dining experience and the service was top notch. It was a little pricey but extremely happy we went there!",

Like the portions other than chicken piccata which I'll get to later.   NY Rao's is a hidden gem and invitation or a lucky call to get in. Very inside and protected. Vegas is open to the world. So, be prepared to wait even with a ressie. The bar is also huge and a good spot to hang or even eat. Fun vibe.   Oscar did a nice job as a server and handled us and a crazy group of 18 guys behind us. Loud? You bet.   Started with wine by the glass and shared meatballs as big as your head. One each. Just ok.   Veal piccata was great with a zucchini perfectly cooked. But not enough to share.   So, all that for about $180. Hmmmmm, oh well you only live once.   I think I'll wait for the next lucky NY call.",

It was an overall pleasant experience. I had the caprese salad and spaghetti bolognese. The caprese salad didn't have enough basil, but the taste was really good. The spaghetti was good. The pasta is not made in-house and wasn't anything special.  I skipped dessert because I thought it looked overpriced for creme brulee ($14). Had the other food been outstanding, it may have been convincing to order a standard dessert and expect something worth double the price of an average restaurant's charge for the same.",

However I went in with an open mind looking forward to a good Italian dish. I got to say that the Seafood Salad was very good! I had the Shrimp Scampi over linguine, pretty good but nothing to get crazy about.  The server we had was slow and shaky, such as having to be asked 3 times for a glass of wine.  I never pay close attention to the bill, however my wife does. She asks me what this random $7 charge was on the bill. I was going to pay it do we could just go but she insisted on asking. The server says that was for distilled water. Then I was confused as we ordered a bottle of Pellegrino which was also $7 and was already on the bill. After a little back and forth, he finalyy had the $7 removed.  This little incident turned me off completely to this place and I would never even consider on going back.   Please either consider a different Italian Place or check your bill carefully.",

    "text": "Why 2 stars for \"Overall?\"  Well, we have been visiting the various Rao's in the country for years starting with the original in the Bronx.   Caesar's opened and we were there.....and finally we got our own in Los Angeles that we visit often and enjoy.   The issue with the dinner we had at Caesar's Place on Tuesday, October 13, 2016 with 6PM reservations for 5 adults is this;  We spent almost $425 to celebrate my Sisters 50th wedding anniversary.  When we were reviewing the menus and options for the evening, I had seen a plate go by that didn't look familiar and asked our waiter what it was and he responded \"we can do anything you want with pasta and sauces.\"  Great answer....I thought!   One of the specials that day was Chicken Parmesan which I love and ordered.  I was told it came with spaghetti and marinara sauce and asked for penne or rigatoni instead.  Our waiter informed me that the Chef would not change the pasta on this dish but i could order a side dish for an additional charge and I asked why and was told that was \"the rule.\"  Well, this is truly not acceptable.   I kindly spoke with a Manager and was informed the same thing.  Feeling defeated and not understanding the issue with placing penne on the plate instead of spaghetti with the same sauce made no sense.   Our meal was spectacle as always but the taste left in our mouth ruined the evening for me and my Guests.   More bad news came when the bill arrived.   $44 for the chicken parmesan with spaghetti.  $44 for a slab of pounded chicken...which was delicious and 4oz of spaghetti and I couldn't have a penne with it instead.   Will we return....uncertain.   If a simple request, in a world class restaurant can not be made, then it might be time to revisit your customer base and what message this sends.  (this is not a fast food Italian restaurant.  The restaurant was not busy as usual due to our early arrival time and to think that the kitchen could not handle a simple change is disturbing.",

I came here for my friends 21st birthday and when we got the menu nothing in it made me think it was going to be elevated food because it all looked like food you can cook at home. But of course I try it and I was right. If it wasn't for the great customer service this place would get a star. It's overpriced because it's in a hotel, that's it.  Conclusion: You'll spend a lot of money for no reason and forget you came here",

    "text": "We were here last night for NYE - ate at 7:30pm. First off, let me give a shout out to their jar sauces which you can buy in supermarket. We are so fond of their arribiatta sauce that when we learned there was a restaurant here we were thrilled.  Unfortunately, bc it was NYE we were at mercy of a prie fixe.   The caprice salad was the highlight of the meal.  For the pasta course I had these browned butter ravioli which were ok and David had penne with vodka sauce, same.  Dinner he had some chicken dish and I had the eggplant parm.  I love eggplant parm, but it was pretty obvious the hard little disks were not cooked to order and probably reheated from prep last night?  I had cheesecake for the prix fixe - a 2\" square of it you might expect at an office party.  All in all, we let our expectations be too high based on the jar sauce. The cool thing is that we got to taste their olive oil - available online.  So we will continue ordering the good stuff but likely won't feel the need to return to the restaurant  Incidentally, excellent service.  But id rank this one on the same level as a bucca de beppo.",

Don't get me wrong the atmosphere is great and the staff was personable and professional, the antipasto the side of meatballs were great.   The problem is, I have a favorite dish and its one that every place does a little different and that's OK but when I saw that they had chicken scarpiello on the menu I thought I was in for a dinner to remember.  Rao's does it with bone in chicken pieces which I suppose is more authentic if harder to eat and that wasn't the problem the problem is I have had better for half the money at a little pizza/pasta place in Westchester NY! The sauce was just so so and the sausage was not the best (nor the worst certainly) that I have ever had and the chicken pieces were a little less than meaty.  Oh well I will dream that some day Martin Scorsese will cast me and I can get into the original and see how it stacks up!  If I had ordered anything else for dinner I probably would have given this place at least a 4 but it was sort of like meeting your child hood hero and finding out he has a beer gut and too much nose hair, he still might be a great guy but you built him up to be something better.",

I might never get a chance to try those legendary meatballs in NYC, so this could be my only chance.   Alright, ordered two meatballs as an appetizer, with Penne alla Vodka as the main course. The meal came with rather plain jane bread that was good and fresh, but nothing spectacular.   So, the meatballs are about 5oz each and are covered in a thinly sweet Marinara sauce, sans any pasta. Real Italian Polpettine, perhaps a little too large for Napoli but delicious & soft while retaining an exterior form that prevents them from mushing. I tasted beef, pork, and veal, with parsley and garlic. Yum yum. Oh so yum yum!  Ah, the Penne alla Vodka? Now, it was served while I was still chowing on the meatballs (haha--did I write that?), and that is a faux pax of serving but I forgive them. Now, the sauce was a little too thick for my taste; I think a loosening of some starchy pasta water would have helped. But it was deliciously creamy, with a nice pepper bite to it, and a delicate balance of pancetta and garlic. The graininess from the vodka was perceptible, but not overwhelming.   Well-done.",

Reservations - Book early if you can, because this is a popular place due to Rao's in New York.  Good for Groups - they can accommodate groups of many sizes.  Service - The service is worth a 5.  They definitely know their stuff and will tell you what they like or what is popular.  Overall, it is like working together to create a great meal experience.  Starters- Not bad at all. Not a 5 but not a 3 either. 3.75!  a.  Meatballs - There were five of us and we actually ordered 3 meatballs to split. They are rather large, larger than you anticipate so this was perfect.  b.  Pasta - We split two of the Fusilli with Sausage and Cabbage. Very nice and light. We ordered two dishes and while rather small, we all had a bit of a helping so it was fine.  The sausage and the cabbage make for a nice mix.  c. Antipasto Della Casa - Very nice. Besides all the normal meats, cheese, peppers, tomatoes and olives, they also give you gran padano cheese. It is my favorite...  d.  Roasted Peppers - Very nice with pine nuts!  Main Entree -  We shared three meat dishes and it was plenty  a.  Grilled Lamb chops - Awesome and especially on the bone. So tasty!  b.  Osso Bucco - Huge shank and that means a lot of bone marrow to dig out.  Yum Yum for those that like the marrow!  c.  Veal Parmasan - Nice and tender.  It was pretty good.    Overall the Osso Bucco and Lamb Chops were great, the Antipasto and the meatballs were awesome and everything else was pretty good.  GK says check it out.  Remember, great service!",

Everything is ridiculously overpriced including wines by the glass ( $15-$20). Food also overpriced BUT extremely delicious...best red sauce I've ever had...seriously! Also probably best tiramisu which we don't usually order since it's pretty much the same everywhere but it was extraordinarily good. So your going to dig in your wallet same as everwhere in Vegas but u can expect a large, very filling, extremely delicious Italian meal here, which u don't often get everywhere else! I will hit again next time in Vegas!",

    "text": "Rao's lived up to the hype!  We made a reservation for 4 on a Friday night and arrived right at our reservation time.  We wound up having a party of 5 and we were told that they would be able to accommodate us, but it would take 10 minutes and we could sit at the bar and wait until the table is ready.  No thank you, especially when I see multiple tables in the courtyard area and inside.  We were finally seated in the courtyard area with Matt as our server.  We ordered the garden salad, meatballs, and baked clams for appetizers.  The meatballs were amazing!  Super moist and flavorful in every bite.  We then ordered three entrees to share, penne a la vodka, veal parmesan, and another chicken dish with sausage and peppers (I can't remember the name).  The wait staff shared the penne across 5 plates and we just added the meat dishes to our own plates.  Three entrees was more than enough for the five of us.  Service was great throughout the meal.  Unfortunately, we couldn't try dessert because we were all stuffed!",

    "text": "4 1/2-stars.  Why?  Because they have one of the best meatball dishes I've ever eaten in Las Vegas, but also because this review is a little different from other reviews I've done because I'm actually taking into account a bit of rare service.  A RARE CASE OF GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE I wasn't feeling hungry earlier today despite the fact that I had a reservation at Rao's - the Italian restaurant at Caesar's Palace.  Rao's is purported to have one of the best meatballs in all of Las Vegas so of course I had to try it.  The problem is, I don't think you can really can't rate food if you're completely full.  So I cancelled the reservation and headed off to my evening show. (Penn & Teller)  After the show, I headed straight to Caesars intending on eating dinner by racing over to Rao's. ...It was just under 11PM and I ran up to the maitre d' huffing & puffing and said, \"I MADE IT!  You're still open right?  I'm dying for some meatballs.\"  She said, \"Yes, we're open for the bar, but not for food.\"  I said, \"What?\"  She said, \"The kitchen closes at 10:30PM!\"  I suddenly frowned, became despondent - rolled my eyes and slowly turned around.\" ...Suddenly the girl said, \"Wait.  Hold on.\"  I stopped, and she gestured to come in, and so I did.  She said, \"ONE dish, right?\"  I said, \"Yeah.  Just the meatballs.  That's it.\"  She said, \"Hold on - I'm going to ask the kitchen if they'll prepare just that dish.\"  She was gone for awhile but when she came back she said, \"They're going to take care of you.  One dish of meatballs.\"  She turned to the bartender, where I was sitting by then, and said, \"The kitchen said it's okay - one dish of meatballs.\"  The Bartender said, \"Cool.\"  Needless to say, I tipped her $10 as she left.    THE MEATBALLS And sure enough, when the meatballs arrived, they were steaming hot, smothered in licktastic ally delicious marinara.  (Really - I ache for that marinara... it's so tasty!) The bartender came and put fresh aromatic parmesan cheese all over it that smelled heavenly and to me, marked the beginning of a fantastic meal.  Folks - any time your head swoons when you smell your meal, you know you're off to a good start. ...Taste & texture wise, the meatballs were moist & juicy.  It had good substance and you could tell it was cooked right.  If I had one criticism it would be that I personally could have used a little more sausage in the meat but overall it was a very good meatball.  What took it to the next level really were the parmesan and the marinara.  These folks at Rao's know they're frickin' marinara and cheese for certain.  I licked the plate up and left nothing to wash off.  CONCLUSION The food is the most important part but the service is what gets them to the \"I-will-definitely-return\" level.  The only reason I haven't cranked this to 5-stars is because I think I need to eat their Lasagna, their Spaghetti, and if they have it, Cannaloni, to give it a more thorough review.  4 1/2-stars.",

I MEAN, seriously, I could have bought three sandwiches with that and fed my friends. Also, the pizzas my friends order at 20 bucks after tip and tax.. I mean, SERIOUSLY 20 dollars for that pizza was not worth it. I rather have normal cheap pizza at my cheap ass hotel, than to spend 20 dollars on a pizza that was not OUT OF THIS WORLD....   THE PASTA VODKA something blah blah was good, but not good enough that is deserves four stars from me. Excuse me, the ambiance is nice but I actually want to spend money elsewhere! Let alone, drop 30 on some pasta thats not out of this world! I definitely DO NOT recommend this place to anyone! Save your money and time, and go to a buffet instead!",

Don't expect lettuce, but an excellent light simple dressing.  For my entree, I had Gnocci ala Bolognese.  The sauce was incredible: a perfect combo of their signature veal,beef, and pork combination that goes into their meatballs.  It was so good I ate it with a spoon to get as much sauce as possible.  My wife ordered the Lemon Chicken which was cooked perfectly and served on the bone.  Service was excellent.  For our children, they prepared half orders of penne with alfredo sauce and a pasta with smoked salmon.",

Italy being one of my favorite countries, and food.   Ceasars Palace Rao's is in my opinion a total rip off, in pricing and quality of food comparatively speaking.  When you pay 27 dollars for a spaghetti plate I expect something rather good, if not the best.  The spaghetti we got was no better than chili's or spaghetti warehouse type but they only charge 10 dollars.  Serious, I ordered Osso Buco, and it was 47 dollars, believe me, it was the worst i've had.  The buffets in vegas had better Osso Buco, the texture was bad, and had little to no taste to it.  considering the cost of this meal, come on Ceasars Palace you can do better.  Learn from Wynn, and learn from Ballagio.  The manager was nice to offer a comp desert and coffee, but seriously they should have done better, just for customer service.  I'm definitely not dining at any of the Ceasars group chains again, value is the name of the game to customer loyalty, you can't charge high prices just because, provide something decent in return.  total disappointment.",

So, when I found out they opened a location in Las Vegas, I was thrilled. Food was amazing (we had Uncle Vincent's lemon chicken, pasta and Cesar salad), but the service was horrible. Our wait staff was inattentive, didn't take the time to discuss menu items, actually threw salad plates on our table, never asked if we wanted pepper for the salads, more water refills, etc. They were quoting a 45 minute wait with empty tables (although front of the house staff friendly) and the staff looking a bit bored. Never saw a manager checking tables as they should ensure the dining guests are happy. We visited Bouchon the night before (price points are about the same and the difference in service was night and day). I believe if Mr. Rao was aware of the type of service we observed tonight he would be embarrassed.",

First, my party of three walked up to the hostess stand where two young ladies were sitting around chatting while a bunch of dirty tables remained out in the front in an otherwise empty restaurant. We asked for a table and were quickly ushered to a booth. When I asked again for a table I was told that none were available because they were not cleaned off. I asked if maybe she could clean one off so that we could sit there. Begrudgingly she agreed to do. I ordered the chicken ceaser salad. It was pathetic. There was no dressing...none. The chicken was dry, yellow and disgusting.  The salad was turning. I asked for a manager. A manager never showed up. The waiter said she was busy in the back. No new salad, just a lot of attitude. Rather then spend the rest of the afternoon at Rao's or Ceasers Palace, we immediately left the hotel. This is the worst dining experience I've ever had. I will NEVER go back there.

    "text": "Waited for the chance to get to eat at the famous Rao's, yes I know its not the Harlem gem, but hey it should be the same.  This was our perception.  Honestly I absolutely love the sauce Rao's and think it is one of the best jar sauce out there on the market.  So I mean if I love the jar sauce, then even if I am not eating at the original Rao's the carbon copy in Vegas has to be good, right?  Not exactly, the atmosphere was beautiful, we ate outside overlooking the Caesar pool, the sun was setting and it was really romantic.  They serve you warm crispy on the outside soft on the inside bread and have olive oil for dipping.  Love that!!  The wait staff was very friendly and really took the time to recommend some famous dishes.  OK so they serve family style, which means enough for two to four people to share.  Perfect.  So their are four of us, we order the fried mozzarella appetizer, two Caesar salads, side of meatballs, veal parm and one person who doesn't eat meat orders the pasta with red clam sauce.  The verdict...the mozzarella appetizers was good, sauce thick but not like my Rao's in the jar.  Weird I think...the Caesars classic.  The meatballs were so disappointing.  Rubbery and not flavorful.  Reminded me of the ones that you can buy in the frozen food isle of your local supermarket.  The veal parm wasn't that good either, the breading was too thick and the mozz wasn't melted enough, not enough sauce.  The pasta with red clam sauce looked good and they seemed to enjoy it all.  We didn't go for dessert so I can't comment on that, but they do have a store in the front of the restaurant where you can buy Rao's products and cookbooks.  Very cool, but we have this here.  OK so we met this woman who has been to the original Rao's and said that this one is just as good.  Well we had to disagree stating the sauce is nothing like the sauce in the jar, so get this.  She tells us that is because Rao's just uses their name and they do not make the sauce.  Who knew, but have to say that jar sauce is so damn good.  I didn't care who makes it.  So if you want Italian, want the hype that Rao's has become being unattainable in Manhattan then I would say sure make a reservation and enjoy the Vegas but hey you were forewarned.",

Served in butter with pine nuts.  Wow.  Another winner is the \"Pepperoni Arrostitti\", which are Roasted Red Bell Peppers, Tossed with Golden Raisins and Pine Nuts.  Incredible.  The pasta is perfect.  I recommend the Orecchiette, because I like the idea of eating little ears, aside from the fact that its entirely delicious in san marzano tomato sauce.  As a main course, you have to try Uncle Vincent's Lemon Chicken.  Don't ask why, just try it and send me a thank you note later.    Another main course you need to try (but maybe not at the same sitting..  maybe) is the Pollo Scarpariello (Chicken Sauteed with Hot and Sweet Italian Sausage and Yellow and Red Bell Peppers in a White Wine Sauce).  Try it, send me a thanks later, same place.  The meatballs?  What does one say about perfection?  When I went there, the waiter brought us out a couple meatballs without us asking for them.  I said \"We didn't order these\".  He said \"Try them.  You don't like them, they're on me.\"  Well, they were gone when he came back 20 minutes later to check on us.  Enough said.  The Italian Ricotta Cheese Cake is sweet, but not too sweet, as is the Cannoli.  Both go perfect with the coffee, espresso, or some anisette.  You really can't go wrong with this place.  And why is it decorated like Christmas all year round?  Because the previous owner one year decided to leave the decorations up after the holidays, and never took them down again (at the NYC location).  Its in tribute to him.    Oh, and if you see a huge ox of a man at the front, thats Tiny.  Say hi, but be nice.  The desert is a big place my friend.",

    "text": "3.5 stars.  As I have not dined at the original Rao's in New York, I am uncertain of that restaurant's mood. The design of Rao's in Las Vegas resembles a steakhouse, a neighborhood bar, and an old family restaurant, with dark cherry walls, white table cloths, signed photographs on the walls, and a gaudy bar awkwardly situated in the middle of the dining space.   The selection of breads was uninteresting, but leavened by the intensely fruity, clear, beautiful olive oil at the table. The risotto with shrimp was a stellar rendition of the dish, though it released too many droplets of butter in the bowl as we lingered. The shrimp with spicy tomato sauce was visually stunning, with splashes of crimson gracing five gleaming tails, but the seafood was tough and slightly overcooked. And, the housemade sausage, traditionally but nicely seasoned, had a welcome, coarsely ground texture, but could not enliven its accompanying orecchiette and broccoli rabe.   However, the service was impeccable, and the wine pours were generous. Sigh.",

    "text": "I had no idea about the history of the original Rao's when I came here with a group of people for dinner, though one in our party - the one who had tried fruitlessly for years to eat at the original one - was kind enough to tell us about the famed sauce and meatballs.   Since he was the one with all the expectations, seeing him finally eat the meatballs and the enormous veal parmesan and not be underwhelmed was nice, as high expectations can ruin that dream meal.  The special seasonal pasta - purses with blue cheese, pears and cranberries in a sage butter sauce - was tasty, though the lemon chicken my friend ordered seemed to be *the* dish.  Our waiter was one of those old school guys, who'd been working at the high end restaurants in Vegas since the days of Frank and Sammy, and he certainly added to the ambiance, since the schizophrenic music selection (Christmas, Motown and a bit of Italian thrown in for measure) didn't do much.  And outside a small misunderstanding on the wine order where the sommelier gal opened up a bottle about 4x the price of the one we ordered, it was enjoyable, if a bit overpriced for the food and ambiance.  But hey, it's Vegas, right?",

The food was good, the numerous teeny biscottis in the biscotti dessert assortment were adorable and tasty, the wait staff was attentive, even the manager strolled through and was checking on every table to make sure people were having a good experience.  He spent a few minutes joking with us and it was great.    The atmosphere was classy but had a vague undercurrent that had a bit of mafia-gangster/Rat Pack type of feel, but that's the undercurrent of atmosphere I had been expecting throughout Caesar's anyway.    Overall, we had a good time, enjoyed the food and service, and would return.",

Even on Restaurant Week, really!? The corkage for 2 bottles of wine was $75! The special salmon in almond sauce was swimming in clarified butter with no taste, no sauce. The other 3 in our party ordered lemon chicken. (Don't!) What they got was  a big plate of chicken pieces, with barely a touch of lemon flavor ....nothing else. The $35 plate of mixed vegetables were extra and that translated to a plate of eggplant slices that no one touched. No one finished their meal. Total tab $250 + tip which my husband regretted.",

The veal was also quite good - we've had better, but I certainly would not turn it down.  it's all alla carte so the price can add quickly, like most upscale Vegas restaurants.

For the first time we were seated on the patio which was fine although our server was a little slow and not so attentive. The Caprese salad appetizer was good (great fresh mozzarella) although the tomato's werent too tasty. The pasta dishes we both had were very good and once our server found out we were locals, he managed to deliver a special desert on the house as it was our anniversary. A nice way to finish a pretty good meal.",

    "text": "Overview: Rao's was pretty good. Good New York style Italian. Not trying to do anything too fancy, for those of you who enjoy Classic Italian without a crazy twist. Although I will say that this place is totally overpriced. You could get just as good Italian food somewhere else for much less. But you won't be disappointed.   Vodka Penne: This was so good! Sometimes vodka sauces can be way too creamy and this one was the perfect balance between creamy and acidity. I think the pasta is all made in-house too, at least some of it is. And it's all really good.   Shrimp Scampi: Oh my goodness. I wish I could eat this every night forever. Out of all the meals I tried, this one was the best. Their shrimp were big, super meaty and had great flavor. The scampi sauce was the best I've ever had, and I make a mean scampi at home, so that's saying something. I recommend getting it with angel hair pasta. Super delicious. You have to try it.   Eggplant Parmesan: So this was the only thing we ordered that was just okay. I've had many eggplant parmesans in my life, so it's hard to find one that soars above the others. I think my issue was that it was a little bland and not crispy. Eggplant Parmesan needs to have a little crunch because of the natural sogginess of eggplant. This didn't really have it. Something that was good was the eggplant slices were really thick and there was a delicious layer of browned, melted cheese. Gotta love that cheese.   The salmon was also fantastic and very unique. Other favorites were the Steak Pizzaiola, and the Veal Parmesan.   I would say if you are a huge Italian fan, give it a try. It's definitely worth the trip if you are willing to spend a little more.",

I was down...being half Italian I'm always down for Italian food!!! One thing I don't like to do is make reservations for dinner while on vacation...I like to have my places picked out where I want to eat, but it's really hard to follow a set schedule/itinerary.  Based on that I suggested we just go here early to eat dinner, around 5 after they open.  That idea worked out great.  We came in on a Monday night shortly after they opened and we were seated promptly - no problems there.  For starters you get a bread basket with a tomato flavored dip which was really good along with these huge cheese flavored crisps.  The wine list wasn't the most expensive I've seen in Vegas, but wasn't the cheapest either.  Our server was able to recommend a wine that paired great with the penne vodka I ordered.  For starters we ordered the meatballs... pretty big in size, and reminded me a lot of the meatballs my Grandma used to make.  My dinner was the Penne Vodka - and added sausage to it for the added protein as pasta alone won't fill me up.  This wasn't your usual vodka sauce which is super creamy...it was much better than that.  I was pleasantly filled at the end of my meal but left just enough room to share the angel food cake for dessert - sugar free, fat free, and gluten free so ... a little less guilt there!  This place was great all around...great food, atmosphere, and service.  I highly recommend coming here for dinner!",

We tried the lasagna and the meatballs. We had a show to go to so we let them know ahead of time that we're a bit pressed on time. The service wasn't all that great and they weren't even busy.  The lasagna was good but nothing special. The meatballs were huuuuuge and tasty. I won't mind coming back for these balls but I'd probably take them to-go so, I don't have to deal with the service.",

The flavorless mussel soup was laughably minus mussels, and the entrees were so burned that our bill was significantly reduced. Can anyone tell me how chicken parmigiano is served with pasta, but the veal is not? What does it cost to add a little pasta - 25 cents?  And an Italian restaurant without minestrone soup, or any other soup, other than the aforementioned mussel soup without mussels?  Not to mention there was no old school Italian ambience - evidenced by them playing Rod Stewart in his heyday - oh puhleeze, don't get me started. Compliments to the manager for expediently addressing the issues. My partner a world-traveled foodie, and me, being European, can honestly say we have had a better experience at Olive Garden. This is a lousy representation of an Italian restaurant. But, this is Vegas. Fake is the name of the game.",

My fiance is a CIA chef and owns restaurants in the VA-DC-MD states. Coordinating large groups while still taking care of other customers is truly a delicate balancing  act and one that requires a lot of coordination, skill and talent from the servers to the chefs.    We had a predetermined menu with incredible menu items. All the food was served family style with one of the courses already plated.   As a vegetarian who does eat fish, Our table was asked in advance about dietary needs so they could bring out an additional item for me. I was so impressed with the service and the quality of food. Our tables never lacked for anything and we had wonderful wines and beers served throughout the dinner -9 bottles of The Prisoner, 8 bottles of Robert Mondavi Winery Merlot and 8 bottles of Ruffino Pinot Grigio.   The food came out hot and everything was delicious! Truly a fantastic experience-  the entire restaurant was packed when we got there for our 8 o'clock reservation.   By the time dessert came, I knew I was too full to eat anything. As soon as the dessert sampler was set down though... I ate a mini cheesecake that was perfectly chilled and an incredible chocolate dessert.  Five stars to the staff and the kitchen!",

I even have a signed one from Frank Senior.  Not signed for me but someone else named Alex. Got it on Amazon : )  We got a nice booth as requested.  Bread delivered to table but not the cool bread basket I see on even recent Yelp pics.  Just some unheated sliced bread.  Okay.  Our waiter was good.  He really tried to make our evening nice.  I asked him about the free New Yorker Martini if you check in on Yelp.  He didn't know anything about it.  Then I checked in and no offer came up.  I kinda felt a little stupid. Thanks for taking away the promotion.  Okay.  We ordered a half order of their world famous not to be believed fucking fantastic meatballs.  It was fine.  Maybe a little mushy.  We both agreed I make better meatballs on any given Sunday night.  Not bad, just not worth all the glorious hype.  I've been looking forward to their Veal Parmesan for weeks now.  Staring at the posted Yelp pictures like some kinda food pervert.  It looked good on arrival but soon found out it was overcooked, not much flavor, and not much marinara sauce.  I asked for a child's portion of Spaghetti with marinara.  That was dry and I got dinged $13.00 for it.    I ate a little less than half and sent it back.  Just not good and no way worth $53.00.  The waiter took it off the bill. My wife ordered the Frutti di Mare seafood pasta.  The seafood was cooked perfectly but the sauce was so hot she did not enjoy her food and just ate the seafood.  For the record she likes spicy food.  This was crazy hot.  Our waiter trying to salvage the evening brought over some Tiramisu at no charge.  It was good.  Rao's is a one and done for us.",

They served us a hearty Pink Lentil Bean Soup that was absolutely delicious and a Cesar Salad that was big enough to split between two people--and they split it for you.  I ordered the Sundried Tomato Chicken Penne tossed in a roasted garlic light cream sauce. It wasn't too heavy, but they served a lot of it--which if you have access to a fridge you certainly would want to take this with you.  Large pieces of Maine lobster meat, clams, and snow crab claws topped the lovely Frutti Di Mare my friend had. The meat fell out of the shells with ease and melted in the mouth. A hint of spice was in the background--not spicy to those that like it HOT; it was just right. My friend raved about how fresh and delicious it was.  Johnny Double Scoops was our server. Great personality; very attentive; excellent service.  I definitely would come here again.",

    "text": "Odds are that I'll never be able to eat at the original Rao's in NYC since it's small and fairly exclusive,  but the Rao's in Las Vegas in Caesers was pretty amazing.  The place was sprawling,  and packed on the Sunday night that we went, glad I made reservations.  Great atmosphere as well, very dark and away from the noise of the casino.  Highly recommend the lasagna, it was actually pretty pretty perfect for what my definition of what old school American style Italian red sauce cooking should taste like.  We shared the creme brulee for desert,  and it was also quite tasty.  There is fantastic food all over Vegas, and most of it overpriced,  but this was worth it.",

Clams were over cooked but the white sauce was delicious. We also ordered a side of meatballs. It was very juicy and tender. The crab carbonara was delicious, but I didn't taste enough crab. I think a little more crab will make this dish a little more special than what it was.",

So tonight my husband and I came and omg let me tell you the meal was amazing! We first ordered the meatballs and they are hands down the best meatballs I've ever had. I ordered the penne vodka and the first bite was so delicious and each bite I took was more and more amazing as the one before (I am drooling just thinking about it!)I wish I didn't fill up on the meatballs and bread so I could have eaten every last bite of my plate (I took the leftovers back to the room) and yes it was even delicious heated up lol.  My husband ordered the chicken parmigiana which was also delicious he got the New Yorker to drink and he said it was good, I don't drink so i ordered the pink lemonade. I would highly recommended coming here when you visit Vegas",

We were seated on the patio area and they give you complimentary bread and some crackers as an appetizer which is nice.   After the bread though is where everything went downhill.   Our food took an hour which is crazy for pasta and it wasn't even busy. They also got our orders wrong and when we told them that they gave us the wrong pasta, they were able to get out a new order in less than 1 minute...  How is that possible that we waited an hour for our food to initially come out but they were able to get us a fresh order of pasta within a minute?   Worst part was, our waiter didn't apologize and then proceeded to say that he fixed it when in actuality, he just gave us what we ordered.   Food was also meh. Pasta sauce tasted bottled and they also only have penne, spaghetti, linguine and angel hair.  Pasta isn't fresh and neither is the sauce :(",

    "text": "Our experience at Rao's was a really great one! Our server, Rebecca has been at that location since the opening and you could tell because she REALLY knows her stuff. I wish we could have gone with more people because I wanted to try a lot more food! We have been cooking from the Rao's Cookbooks for years and have been trying to get into the NYC location for just as long but unsuccessfully.   I'm giving them a STRONG four stars because the service and location were exceptional but there were some small missteps along the way. I think we really wanted it to live up to the hype hype hype and it fell the smallest bit short. The strong points were, service, wine selection, location and even the price point. Rebecca really knew her stuff and she was extremely friendly.  We started the meal with a split caesar's salad... in caesar's palace I died. The flavor was so delicious but maybe a little over dressed but as far as a caesar salad goes, it was bomb. We also had a delicious barolo. We decided to order a half portion of the ravioli purses, the veal chop with the cherry peppers and my mom lovessss spahetti and meatballs lol so that's what she got. I really wanted to try the sauce from Uncle Vincent's Lemon Chicken so they brought me a little side dish of it and I LIVED FOR IT. If you love lemon, you gotta order it.   The ravioli purses were our favorite, they have a sage butter sauce that is so yummmmm. The spaghetti and meatballs was sadly a little bit cold but the meatball was bomb, velvety smooth and delicious. The spaghetti was a little lack luster but TBH I wouldn't have ordered it with someone else. The veal chop was perfectly cooked but I wanted the style to be more saucy? I can't explain but it wasn't what I expected...   We got the cheesecake for dessert, it was a waste of calories. Kyma in New York has the best cheesecake I've ever had and nothing has even touched it since.   Overall would recommend and return just may order differently! Thank you Rebecca for the awesome service!!",

The fried green tomato caprese was good too, though the fresh was better.  My nephew ordered glorified Mac and cheese (Quattro formaggi)... OMG - best Mac and cheese ever, so rich you will have leftovers, but not greasy. I wanted frutti de mare and it wasn't on the menu.  But I noticed the ingredients for it on other items.  So I asked the waiter and he and the chef easily accommodated it.  The calamari was fork tender, the shrimp plump and the clams in the shell were all open.  Go for yummy Northern Italian and portions that will yield leftovers.  Relax with great service and hopefully, great conversation.",

    "text": "Rao's in New York City is notorious.  It is not clear how good their food actually is since no one is able to get a reservation at the restaurant.  Seriously, the wait is measured in terms of years, and at the end of the day, they primarily serve pasta like most any other Italian restaurant in the city.  In Las Vegas, it is a different story.  One can freely walk into the restaurant with the hope of actually getting a table.  Short of that, a seat at the bar is almost always guaranteed.  I believe the menu is the same, and the owner was at the restaurant on my visit, so I felt like I was able to have roughly the same experience as I would in New York if I had somehow managed a reservation.  I ordered the gnocchi bolognese and had a glass of Montepulciano.  The dinner began with a bread course served with a plate of olive oil and vinegar.  I was happy with this beginning with the tasty bread and the good quality olive oil.  The gnocchi were beautifully presented simply dressed in a deep dish.  I had an impressive amount of pasta before me, and the gnocchi were not heavy at all.  I thought the texture was great.  The sauce was very flavorful and balanced.  Simple and good, exactly what I wanted.  The wine paired well.  More generally, I was pleased to have a nice selection of Italian wines available by the glass.    The restaurant itself was fairly busy and very dynamic.  The interior is dark and nearly every square inch of the walls was decorated with photos of the celebrities who have visited.  I know that can be kind of cheesy, for example at the Carnegie Deli, but here I was getting more of a Minetta Tavern kind of feel.  I think this location of Rao's is a wonderful place to have a glass of wine and a plate of pasta.  It definitely gets my vote over places like B and B Ristorante which charges far more for less.  Recommend.",

Wow is all I have to say from the fresh calamari, to the hefty meatballs that if you could imagine an Italian grandma could be making in the kitchen in the back.  The sauces were rich and flavorful with not a lot of butter.   If you are craving authentic Italian then this is your place...Fugedaboutit!",

    "text": "Birthday Vegas Trip: 4/3 - 4/9, 2013 Man, I really wanted to like this place.  Given the hype and exclusivity of the NY location, I thought it a real treat to get a table at the Rao's in Caesar's.  It was the last night of our trip and we wanted to really celebrate.  The menu called to me, and I was psyched.  We sat \"outside\" in the tables meant to mimic NYC; a nice enough spot, and even the noise from the casino wasn't too distracting.  We were welcomed with bread and olive oil, all very delicious, and we ordered a bottle of Montepulciano. I started with the Roasted Beet Salad which, truth be told, was one of the reasons I really wanted to come.  It was tasty, but was loaded with way too much arugula and not enough of everything else.  There's not much worse than an uneven salad.  I knew the salad would fill me, so for my entree I ordered the Baked Clams.  Again, I so wanted them to be good and they just were not.  Way too much filling, which had little flavor.  My fiance's Spaghetti Alla Bolognese was truly delicious, however.  The sauce was rich and had layers of meaty flavor.  We both enjoyed that!  Again, we skipped dessert because there wasn't much on the menu that was a 'must-order'.  The service was pleasantly acceptable, nothing of note, until it was time for the check.  Our server brought us the check and it was not ours, not realizing until she ran the credit card.  The charge stayed on our card for a few days, which was a definite inconvenience.  Unfortunately, (and it pains me to say this!) several times during the meal, I found myself wishing that we'd gone across the way to the Bacchanal Buffet.",

    "text": "Rao's has been one of the top dining experiences we've had in Vegas. The service was absolutely outstanding. Our server was exactly what you would expect to find in a New York Italian restaurant - like the Italian grandfather I never had. He was very knowledgeable about the menu, incredibly friendly (and a little grandfatherly), and anticipated needs before we could even ask.  The food was quite delicious. Definitely get the meatballs. Even if you don't usually care for meatballs (like me), get the meatballs. Probably some of the best meatballs you will ever have.  My standard Italian dish, which for me can make or break a restaurant, is penne vodka. And the penne vodka here was above and beyond. Penne vodka has been a favorite dish of mine since I lived in NYC - and Rao's, in my opinion, is the best place in Vegas for it.  Sadly, I never had the chance to eat at the original Rao's in NYC. It can be rather exclusive and quite difficult to get a table at. Vegas Rao's provides you the opportunity to experience the great food and service the original Rao's is known for, but without having to be a celebrity.",

We started with the Beet Salad, Stuffed Clams and Red Peppers. All three are recommended. For main course we had the Veal Parmigiana and Meatballs. By far the best bone in veal parm I have ever had and the meatballs complemented it perfectly. At this point we were so fully but we could not pass up dessert.  We had the Tiramisu and the Canolis. All I can say to both is wow. The perfect way to finish off an old style Italian meal. The servers were on point and very attentive. The check in process was very pleasant even though it was very busy. Great filling meal!",

    "text": "While on vacation in the beautiful Las Vegas we decided to eat at Raos. It was super close to our hotel and had really great reviews. While entering the decor is nice and sets a good mood. I started with a strawberry spiritz which was okay. Pretty basic drink it had strawberries, vodka, lemon sour and sparking soda. My boyfriend and I split the caprese salad and it was so good. The tomatoes were very fresh and cheese was so rich and creamy. For our main course I got the stuffed ricotta shells. They were cooked to a perfect al dente. The tomato ricotta sauce had just the right amount of acidity and creamy texture. For dessert I ordered the tiramisu. It was near perfection. The coffee flavor was prevalent but not over powering. The mascarpone cream was so silky smooth. The whole bite was just perfect. All the flavors meddled together harmoniously.   With all that being said and the food being absolutely perfect the reason for the two stars was unfortunately due to the service. The service here was sub par at best. I know being young and being a waitress myself I understand the stigma with young people and how they do not tip a lot. With that being said I try to be mindful and try to tip well to break the stigma. Unfortunately this stereotype may have gotten to our waitress Angela. She was nice and sure she means well but she never checked in on us. She never checked if I liked my drink, she did not ask about our caprese or even our main course. The drink and appetizer I understand but not checking in on ones main course is something I find unacceptable. She would have gotten a nice tip if she had only checked on us. She managed to check on her other three tables right next to us multiple times but failed to even see how we were doing. Very disappointed how she could let our young appearance get to her. If we are dining at Raos and ordering drinks then we obviously have money. Too bad the service really lacked because the food was top notch.",

I'm drawn every which way, towards the fancy pants prix fixe menus, the over hyped celebrity restaurants, or the over the top buffets. I think I've found my favorite new way to dine.  Casual, comfort Italian food at Rao's.  The two of us shared the Chicken Scarparielo and the Garlic and Olive Oil Linguine, which was the perfect amount of food for two people.  The chicken was simple but so delicious. The dark meat chicken was seared then quickly sauteed with pickled pappadew peppers, onions, and bell peppers. The sharp vinegary bite of the peppers was so vibrant and added such a brightness.  Matched with the sweet peppers and onions, I was in love with the chicken.  The plainest pasta available was probably a tad oiler than I would have preferred, but it was meant as a pasta course not a base for my chicken.  It served it's purpose wonderfully though giving us a carb with which to enjoy our meal.   My only regret?  Not having room for their famed meatballs!",

There is some history about the original restaurant in NY and how a branch came to be located in Vegas.  I sat at the bar for dinner.  The service was fast and efficient.  The bartender was very prompt with drink refills and service.  I did not suffer any lack of attention for eating at the bar compared to a table.  The food was delivered fast.  It was hot and freshly made from what I could tell; I assume they have the components ready to go given the crowds that can occur.  I went with they rmeatballs as a side and their Rigatoni Filleto di Pomodoro.   The meatballs were large, juicy, and hearty with a rich tomato sauce; a great meatball.  The rigatoni was cooked al dente and well prepared for such quick service. The fillet di pomodoro was rich and complex.  The tomato flavor was bright and rich; pancetta smokey.  Onions sweet with just enough bite to them to round out the dish.  The service was fast, staff friendly, and food great.  I did get sick later that night and can't for sure say it was the food, the recent flight, or just happen stance.  But on another trip I would eat at Raos again.",

Two of the dishes were quite tasty - pasta with clams and the pasta with peas and prosciutto.  Probably the best part of the whole experience was watching the server transfer the pasta from the serving dish to the plate... table-side.  Fun!  Things to mention where improvement should be considered:  1.  Serving chicken on the bone.  The Chicken Scarpiello was tasty but hacking the meat off of bones was a bit too \"home-style\" for me.  At home that would be fine but not in a restaurant at those prices.  Small pieces of bone had to be carefully dealt with.  I really worried about getting one lodged in my throat since several somehow made it off of the plate and didn't get noticed until it was chewed.  (I hate spitting out food -- even discretely into a napkin -- while dining in public.  2.  The sausage -- yuck: dry, mealy, some \"carmelized\" beyond the carmel stage, and generally tasteless.  A real disappointment.  AVOID!  3.  Dessert prices.  Twelve bucks for a piece of cheesecake or cannoli.  They were tasty but not worth the price.  Next time we'll walk across the hall and have a $7 Payard pastry!  Now that we've experienced part of the menu I think we are in a better position to make better choices next time.",

The table placed an order for baked clams, fried mozzarella, meatballs, and bruschetta as appetizers, and my partner and I split a Veal Parmagiana and a Penne a la Vodka as main courses.  What had me instantly worried was the speed with which the appetizers arrived.  Food was there in a matter of a few minutes. Baked clams take a while to bake, and when properly prepared arrive at the table piping hot.  Sure enough, the clams were barely warm, and intensely fishy.  We returned that dish to the kitchen immediately; the baked clams were inedible, and had clearly been made hours in advance and reheated, or something.  The remaining appetizers were unremarkable or just bad.  When the Veal Parm and the Penne a la Vodka arrived, I was holding out hope that the situation would improve.  It didn't.  The veal was nicely presented, but the tomato sauce was the most mundane, boring sauce ever, and the penne was completely unremarkable, even if it was the best dish of the evening.  They were just plain bad, and not worth the price.  Finally, the other couple who joined us ordered profiteroles for dessert.   They were the highlight of the meal, but not enough to save this sinking ship from capsizing.  There are plenty of good Italian restaurants in Las Vegas (especially off the strip).  I would recommend you try those first.  The food at Rao's is mediocre  at best, and not worth the prices charged.  Avoid.",

Beggar Ravioli purses are filled with Bartlett pear  and Ricotta Cheese tossed in brown butter fresh sage and dried cranberries light dish full of flavor. The other dish we tried on this visit was great as well. The Chicken Scarpariello sauteed bone in chicken, Italian sausage, hot and sweet cherry peppers, yellow and red bell peppers. fresh oregano white wine sauce. This dish was cooked prefect chicken was not over cooked.  Our server Angelia was very professional and personable she knew her menu and had suggestions. I had made the reservation with note there was a birthday at the table they sent out a birthday dessert which was there carrot cake. Very moist with cream cheese icing very well done Thank you.",

Service was a little less attentive than I expected for the money we are dropping. But they were friendly. (I stress the money because I am a foodie that is happy to shell out for worthy fare) Corkage fee for our wine we brought was an outrageous $35, but still cheaper than a few glasses of wine there. (A glass of Kim Crawford is the same price as a bottle in the store)  I got the lasagne. Good, nothing special. Huge portion, but for over $30 for an average piece of lasagne, it better be big! Flat iron steak needed salt and really...this is an Italian restaurant...why is it a la carte? This isn't a steakhouse. For the money they have the nerve to charge, it just left a lot to be desired. It was not bad, don't get me wrong. But I'd never pay that much money again for that meal. You are paying for the name, not the food and that's pretty clear. My family's recipes are way better. I guess I need to sell my Italian food! Haha!",

    "text": "I have been to this Rao's location twice, once back in 2010 on my honeymoon, and then again recently when my husband and I vacationed in Las Vegas.  This meal was one of the highlights of our trip to Las Vegas.  Our love for Rao's begin probably about 5-7 years ago when our local supermarket used to sell the Rao's roasted red peppers which they have since discontinued carrying.  We loved those peppers so much that every Christmas I would suck up the high shipping cost order them from the Rao's website for my husband as a gift.  When we planned out honeymoon to Vegas in 2010 we knew we would have to visit Rao's and our visit then as well as our recent visit did not disappoint.  On our recent visit, we started our meal off with the antipasto della casa telling the waiter not to be afraid to go heavy on the roasted red peppers- he did not disappoint us!  The antipasto della casa was a great way to start off the meal.  The combination of cheeses, meat, greens, and roasted red peppers set the stage for our night.  Next up we decided to order three meals and share so that we could try a few different things.  We ordered the penne vodka, pollo scarpariello, and the ravioli (can't remember the name of this one).  The Pollo Scarpariello is one of my favorite dishes of all time!  This dish combines chicken, hot & sweet sausages, and peppers in a yummy sauce. I have never had another dish that I have enjoyed as much as this one!  It was just as good as I remember it from our 2010 visit to Rao's.  The penne vodka was very good and the ravioli was very flavorful.  Our waiter was very attentive through-out the meal. He never rushed us and made sure we had what we needed.  I love Roa's so much- highly recommend the Pollo Scarpariello and their roasted red peppers!!  I will come to Roa's whenever in Vegas!!",

The rib eye my husband ordered was cold, not room temp but ice cold, no au jus either, (seriously) so thin and filled with fat that by the time we could see the steak it might have been the size of your palm. The sommelier was not happy (AND showed it) how rude of us that we did not order wine!.. we were having cocktails! He quickly turned around showing us his disdain with a sour look. The little lamp on the famous 'jar', was totally torn to pieces, the waiter was clueless. The table was way too tight for a party of 4, I felt I was at a taco bell, the tables that are inside the booths have no space at all, and the restaurant was not full.  They could have given us a better seating area. The person that showed us to our table was not happy that we requested another spot, so then she placed us in a worse location. This was 12/26/16 I felt bad because my sister paid for this outrageously expensive dinner (reminded me of buca di beppo) which I was invited once, saw the food, tasted something filled with red sauce and left.  Nothing was notable, not a thing, not the heavy handed sauce on my pasta, nor my nephew's seafood salad that was the size of a tapas dish.  I was wondering about the food in this place...how come I had better food in a smaller unknown restaurants in Rome/Venice/Capri/and Florence? And also here in the US!  What a shame.",

Nice place (Caesar's Palace and easy to find at the casino exit into the Shops area), the restaurant itself was actually better than the service (think Capone style). I would not call our server unprofessional per se but he had an indescribable edge to him that made us a bit uneasy especially when he would grab a chair and sit with us for a bit? The food was very good. we shared a meatball (to die for, so moist and the marinara sauce divine), and my spouse had the rigatoni with pancetta, onion, tomatoes. The pasta was well cooked and he gave it a 4 out of 5. My linguini with clams was a 5. For me, it is hard for anyone to give me perfect pasta as I am picky and I despise overcooked pasta especially when at a restaurant, you pay a premium for such a cheap dish (for the house). The clams were great, only found 1 broken shell. The garlic wine sauce was fantastic, not too heavy and just enough of it. Well seasoned. Drinks were good but pricey. I expected the bill to be a bit heftier overall, but we were pleasantly surprised. Would I come back here? Vegas is a foodie Mecca and there are just too many other places to go and try so, no.. But I would not dissuade anyone else from coming here for the love of Italian food!",

    "text": "As recommended, the meatballs and lemon chicken were incredible.  The spaghetti was fantastic as well.  The ambiance was warm and welcoming with the perfect balance of class and comfort.  The reason that this review isn't getting 5 stars is because the waiter was really bad.  To wait for 10 minutes to be asked if we wanted another glass of red wine even though a refill was clearly needed at the time that our meal arrived is unacceptable - at least it a unacceptable anywhere that the price of a glass of wine is the same as the price of the wine bottle at the store.    Also, there was no butter or vinegar served with the bread at the start of the meal, only olive oil.  While I've had some \"unique\" bread,  to serve cold bread without butter cheapens the meal.  Even after asking for it twice, our butter arrived with the busser right before he cleared our starters....the food however was fantastic.   We'll be back for the food...and to hope for a different server.",

    "text": "Great food stop when wandering the Vegas strip.  Since it's pretty much impossible to get a reservation at the Rao's in Manhattan, as soon as I saw this one in Vegas, we had to stop in!  We went during lunch and there's no need for reservations, there's some tables \"outside\" aka overlooking the busy hallway giving it an almost sidewalk like feel or you can sit at the bar (which has some nice sunken corners for 3).  Wait staff is somewhat slow but food was really good.  Dont get me wrong, staff was really nice but ya...service was sllooowwwww.  We noticed a few people frustrated with not getting their food in time and having to leave or waiting more than 5 mns to pay their check.  Mind you it was NOT busy...Bar area was only half full.  Most were conference people so no idea if they made it out on time, we were in no rush so we enjoyed ourselves right up to their \"break\" time before dinner.  *Affettati Misti: thinly sliced parma prosciuto, soppressata, cubed provolone cheese, gaeta olives, pickled cornichons, sweet marinated garlic and mache greens.  Delicious and sure to severely increase your salt intake... *Le Polpotte di Rao's: traditional Rao's meatballs served in tomato sauce.  2 HUGE succulent and flavorful meatballs in some of the best tomato sauce.  Hands down, some of the best sauce. Really. *Bianca (Foccacia): really great flatbread to go with both dishes.  One to cut the salt and one to mop up the sauce.  Bread was crisp outside and fluffy inside.  Great olive oil, rosemary and sea salt sprinkled on.  We'll definitely return next time we're in Vegas since it takes 3-4 months to get a table in nyc ...",

    "text": "I'm hard-pressed between Italian or Thai as my favourite cuisines, but Rao's makes it easy to pick, that's for sure. We made reservations for a 6:30 dinner, but due to our schedule, we showed up early and they were more than happy to seat us around 5:45.  The menu options made it difficult to choose, but I finally decided on the Ravioli Purses while he chose the Rigatoni Filetto di Pomodoro. We debated ordering appetizers, but given how much we'd been eating on our vacation, we bypassed it and enjoyed the amazing freshly baked bread that came out.  I was absolutely shocked by how fast the food came out! I was expecting 15 minutes at least, but I swear, it was only five minutes before a server came out with our dishes. With a glass of wine each, we dove into our food. There's not too many ways I can describe what we had as ~*delicious*~. Amazing and subtle flavours, this was nothing like I've had before. We both cleared our plates and despite not having an appetizer, were quite full and happy by the end.  The service itself is amazing. One of the chefs came out to go over the specials and make recommendations, as well as review the wine list with us. He came out several times to check up on us, and the servers were also extremely attentive and courteous.   While a bit on the pricy side, I'd say that Rao's is worth it. Between the quality of the food, the speedy service, and the amazing attention to detail, we were more than happy with the bill, which wasn't that pricy when I think about it. I've had good quality Italian before and this was quite reasonable by the end of the meal. I would be more than happy to go back at some point in the future!",

    "text": "So Sad. Poor Rao's is really going downhill.   We dined here in 2010 and had a marvelous time. It is pricey, but for a special occasion... the pasta is excellent.   Cut to New Year's Eve 2012. I made an 8 pm reservation 6 months in advance. I called to confirm the reservation 3 days prior to the date. At no time did anyone mention to me that this restaurant does a mandatory prix fixe (price fixed) menu on New Year's. (Important Note: I don't eat meat) So our cute little party of 4 arrives at the restaurant, excited for a stellar meal, and we are informed by a polite hostess of the prix fixe menu. This menu is $140 per person. It does not include wine or drinks. The main course has no vegetarian options and there are no substitutions.   We were pissed and disappointed. We are not cheap, but none of us wanted a four course heavy meal that evening.    Moved our reservation to the next night with no problem (I really just wanted a nice bowl of pasta, Jesus). We show up the next day and are quickly whisked to a TINY booth.   Long story short:  We order from a friendly waiter and receive several appetizers and dishes. The flavors are lovely, my fiance was particularly impressed with the bolognese sauce. Unfortunately for me, my first bite of Linguine and Clams with red sauce was FULL of sand and grit. OWW! My tooth!  I should have sent the dish back but figured I just had bad luck and soldiered on stupidly. Again the flavors were great, but when a guest is paying $30 for a plate of pasta, the kitchen better make damn sure there isn't SAND in the clam shells!   As we left, I mentioned my issue to a manager, just to let him know so that he could alert the kitchen. He could not have cared less. He gave me a half-assed, \"I'm Sorry,\" and walked off. Ass.   We will not be back.",

    "text": "Coming from a large Italian family, I am very particular about Italian food. I have heard about Rao's for years because of its New York City location and reputation, so I was eager to dine there on this last trip to Vegas. Loved it and will make sure to eat there every time I go to Las Vegas.  Atmosphere: Excellent...very warm, quite setting. This was a huge relief after a full day of crowds, loud music and noise the Las Vegas strip offers. We got there about 30 minutes before our reservation to have a drink at the bar. My husband loves old school cocktails and had an Old Fashioned. He raved about it. The walls were adorned with photos and memorabilia of Rao's legendary past and prestigious clientele. It was fun to take a few moments to look at their history. TIP: The bar is a great place to dine there if you can't get a table.  Wait Staff: Professional, courteous and prompt. The hostess greeted us with a nice smile and offered to sit us at our table even though the rest of our party had not yet arrived. The waiter knew the menu well and made some good recommendations. The sommelier was knowledgeable and helpful. Some of the wines were incredibly expensive and others were very reasonably priced. We purchased a very nice Chianti (one we have purchased at Costco for $40 a bottle) and it was $99 at Rao's, which is a lower than average mark up. In a nutshell, the service could not have been better. TIP: Ask questions...the waiters know the menu well and can help guide you.  Food: There were 4 of us and we did our best to try the menu. The bread basket was excellent....some kind of white bread with olives and a Parmesan covered cracker of some kind. It came with a red pepper butter, which was very good but we preferred regular butter which they gladly brought us. We had the meatballs as an appetizer. They were excellent....very mildly seasoned and covered in the kind of marinara sauce I grew up eating. Our friends had the Steak Pizzaiola...the steak was perfectly cooked and the peppers were not too spicy. We had the Chicken Scarpariello...something I have never heard of before. It was chicken and sausage in a wine sauce....very rich and savory but also very tasty. We love pasta and asked for a side dish of rigatoni with the Bolognese sauce. Our other friend had the fusilli special with seafood and some kind of red pepper/cream sauce. Also very rich and savory but very good. We were too full for dessert. TIP: The portions are very large. If you are a party of 4, order three entrees and ask them to serve it family style, which they will gladly do for you. That way everyone gets to try a new dish.  Pricing: Expensive...the dinner, with the tip, was close to $400 ($100 per person). That is because we had a $100 bottle of wine. But don't expect to get out of there for less than $75 per person. TIP: Plan on spending a lot of money. There is NO cheap dining on the Las Vegas strip.  For a low priced meal, you will have to go downtown.  Summary: We enjoyed our experience there so much we cancelled our reservation for the next night and wet back to Rao's and ate at the bar. This time we had the salad (house salad...excellent and very tangy) and more meatballs. We also had coffee and dessert (the Cheesecake...very good) and coffee.  We loved it and will be return customers every time we travel to Vegas. It felt like I was dining at home.  TIP: Make a reservation and ask for a table back by the glass wall facing the pool. Get there early and experience the bar too.  The only downside, as noted earlier, is the pricing. It is expensive dining but ALL  dining is expensive on the Las Vegas strip. It was worth it to us to find a place that was actually quiet (a rare thing in Las Vegas) and felt warm and welcoming.  Buon Appetito!!",

Caprese salad was small but the buffalo mozzarella was tasty..nothing special though. The meat balls were phenomenal and thy was the saving grace of this place. For $17 I thought we would get more than 2 meatballs but I went here expecting it to be expensive. The lemon chicken was the absolute worst I have ever had. I don't mind when bones are in the chicken but when you leave the rib bones in then butcher the cchicken, you are left with tiny pieces of bone in everything. It was terrible taste and extremely hard to eat with all the bone pieces in it. $28 for half a chicken with loads of bone...no thanks. $30 for a normal size portion of spaghetti bolognese. All in all, cute ambiance and good service but certainly would not be coming back or recommending to anyone.",

    "text": "I went to Vegas with a very old friend of mine that I grew up with in NY.   She is less than adventurous when it comes to food so Italian seemed like a safe bet for dinner for the two of us.  For some reason, I find it difficult to find baked clams in LA and they were a favorite of mine growing up in NY so my friend and I decided to split an order.  They came out piping hot, the breading was plentiful and perfectly seasoned and the ratio of breading to clam was spot on.  A squirt of lemon and I was in heaven.  We didn't want to stuff ourselves before going out for the night and I wanted something simple so I ordered the spaghetti marinara (something I would normally NEVER order out), a side of meatballs to split with my friend and I had a glass of wine to wash it all down.  The pasta was cooked perfectly, the sauce was well balanced, sweet and just a little tangy and the meatballs were everything that everyone makes them out to be.  They are just dense enough not to crumble when you cut into it with your fork and tender enough that they still practically melt in your mouth.  Truly divine.    The portions were HUGE.  I had half of my pasta and half of a meatball left over at the end of the meal.  It's a good thing though because for what they charge, I might have been LIVID if I wasn't MORE than stuffed.  Our waiter convinced us to take our food back to our hotel (even though we didnt have a microwave) and I'll admit, after a long drunk night out, it tasted just as good cold as it did when it was hot and at least I felt like I got my moneys worth and didn't have to eat at McDonalds at 3am.  At least not on that night.",

Unfortunately the bottom was ice cold (as in probably frozen).  The cheese was hard and cold.  Mentioned to my waiter who said the plate was probably cold.  Interesting - cold plates for hot food (I doubt it).  He Re-heated it.  The meat came back tough and rubbery.  The good thing about this meal was I ate little and didn't gain any weight.  The bad was an excessive bill for food that was not edible.   There are many great restaurants in Vegas.  This is not one.",

I was instantly smitten-- seriously, it's one of the best store-bought tomato sauces I have ever had.   So when I saw the Rao's restaurant, I had an instant hankering to give it a try. Against my fiscally conservative judgement and suspicion I was dealing with an overpriced tourist trap, I decided I'd be having my dinner there.   I shared a baked clams oreganata appetizer with my handsome mohawked friend, who looked sorely out of place (we had not planned on fancy dining at the start of our swim adventure). They were succulent and delicious, and we used those tiny forks to get into the microscopic crevice of each clam shell, terrified a small morsel wouldn't make passage to our mouths.   I had a ravioli, with a garlic cream sauce. There were only a few of them on the plate, but they were delicate and well-stuffed with unidentifiable deliciousness.  The service was attentive, the atmosphere was fancy, the food was really great, and they didn't turn us mohawked, pierced, and flip-flop-wearing chlorine-stinking fools away. A really satisfying Vegas dinner!",

    "text": "Came here last night with my boyfriend and I have to say if I were basing my rating on the service alone it would be 5 stars.   We started with the calamari, baked clams, and meatballs. The meatballs were absolutely amazing! They were soft, moist, tender and very flavorful. The calamari was a little too greasy for me but again the sauce was seasoned perfectly. The baked clams were mostly breading and didn't have that crispness on top that you look for.   We then split the Caesar salad which was very good and had nice sheets on thin fresh Parmesan cheese.   For entrees I had the Ossobuco which I was disappointed with. It was a little tough and the risotto was bland. My boyfriend had the chicken Parmesan which he enjoyed.   For dessert the peanut butter tart was delicious!   All in all not a bad meal, but nothing compared to the original back in Harlem.",

Inside looks like an old school Italian restaurant. White linens, lots of wood furniture, the color red everywhere. The place is pretty big too!  We started out with a complimentary bread basket. Filled with several baked treats and served with three types of butter. So good, we asked for a second basket.   For the main event, we all ordered something and split it. Their food can be shared family style but it's also the right size for one person if you go that route.   We had the Caesar salad, veal Parmesan, shrimp scampi and a penne vodka. Everything was delicious!! I would have to pick the shrimp scampi as the group favorite, but I would order everything  else again.   Service is excellent. Our server was very engaging, knowledgable and helpful. If you order a pasta to be enjoyed family style, they will split it up for you table side. Nice touch!!   I highly recommend Rao's for your next Las Vegas Italian food fix!  Enjoy!",

    "text": "We have dined at Raos inside Ceasar's Palace in Las Vegas for several years. Unfortunately, after our last visit on Dec. 11, 2018 we will no longer be back. After being told we could not sit inside the resteraunt because we did not have a reservation, we were seated outside next to a pole in the casino area, which was uncomfortable, as I have Rheumatoid arthritis and my husband is disabled and recently underwent a total knee replacement. I was served something that was not ordered, as I was never actually asked what sides I wanted. I did not complain, but the waiter insisted upon making a scene and several times leaned over me, as if speaking to a child and asking if I would like something else. Several times I told him it was fine, I had no complaint. He then proceeded to loudly exclaim that I would get my meal for free, which embarrassed me and again, I asked him not to do that. They did it anyway...so I proceeded to go inside and ask for a manager so I can pay for my meal. MJ approached me rather aggressively stating that she is a manager and she sarcastically said she took it off because SHE wanted to and she did so, so I would not complain about service. After a rather rude exchange with her I paid my bill and was literally thrown my change. The billfold was shoved into my hand and flipped upward toward my face, spilling my change on the floor. MJ continued chuckling with the other 2 girls standing by the register and watched, grinning, while I struggled to bend down and pick my change up off the floor, while other diners were staring. She caused a complete scene, embarrassed herself, and left me feeling as if I were not welcome to dine there. I had planned to stay at Ceasar's another night, as I still had a paid room reservation, but this encounter left me so flustered that I actually just checked out and drove home that night.",

Dining with a group of five, we had the opportunity to share a large selection of different items, including one restaurant week prefix. The highlights from our meal were the meatballs, which were extremely moist and flavorful, duck cannelloni, the lemon chicken, which is another of their signature dishes, ravioli purses, which wasn't a favorite around the table, but I really enjoyed the sweet and savory elements and the veal parmigiana.   The desserts were classic and delicious as well. The peanut butter and chocolate torte stole my heart but the tiramisu was also very good.

It was tender and surprisingly flavorful for something that sounds so \"plain\" and \"boring\" next to other Rao's menu items.  The service was excellent, especially with selecting and describing their wine list.  My boss is a huge wine snob so our group generally goes through a half dozen bottles at dinner -- I must recommend Rao's Sicilian reds which are tremendous.  Ask your server for a Sicilian that will cater to your tastes.  All of them are excellent.  The restaurant, itself, is somewhat interesting.  The decorations are on par with other traditional Italian sit-down places.  A 360 bar serves as the restaurant's center hub, and various large rooms shoot off of this area.  There is a fake outdoor area by the entrance, which is next to a fountain inside Caesars Palace.  This area can get pretty loud so I would recommend against sitting here.  Alternatively, there is a real outdoor area which faces Caesars' pool.  The pool closes relatively early so there won't be much noise from there but you will get some residual sound from the Strip's traffic.  Overall, this is a nice place for a nice dinner.  The service is excellent and the food is pretty good.  Oh, and I came back again for the meatballs and even though they were hyped, I enjoyed them immensely.  Order them on the side if you can.",

I am please to say no one was ever shot while I was dining  those many times.  Both service and food reached out to re-define mediocrity.  Our waiter regularly disappeared and treated us like we were an old buddy he never really liked.  The only food that had some greatness was the Antipasto which had great roasted peppers, cheeses and good meats, not much of the meats, but good.  The artichokes they served on the antipasto were horrible.  I think they were spoiled.  The stuffed clams were more like a game of Where's Waldo, clams being waldo.  Our entrees, two pasta dishes, ah, so so.  $150 later (two mixed drinks at $11.50 each) I was left feeling I had just lost at one of the tables...  Only this one I will never come back to.

    "text": "Although I enjoyed Rao's, it's probably a bit overpriced for the quantity and quality of food received. The restaurant is located next to the pool at Caesar's Palace. Finding the place was a bitch. There are three dining rooms, two of which replicate the original vibe of the Rao's in NYC. I'd suggest requesting one of the 'original' Rao's rooms (tons of photos, Christmas lights, etc.) instead of the third dining area near the pool (which isn't very interesting). You enter the restaurant and walk through a great bar area to get to your table. The wait staff is pretty good - but I'd definitely ask for one of the New Yorkers imported to offer a higher level of service.   I had grilled zucchini with crabmeat and shrimp which was DELISH. I split an order of lemon chicken (very moist and full of lemony flavor - and a great dish. $24) and penne alla vodka (very good - $20). I'd come to Rao's thinking that the servings would be 'family-sized' but they were really only sufficient for two adults with not much of an appetite. The house Chianti was very good, too. Finished with tiramisu and coffee. Would definitely go back to Rao's even though I'd probably nosh on a few things at the cool bar area.",

We started with an appetizer of octopus and broccoli rabe. The meat was burnt on the outside, tough on the inside -- way overcooked. I wish I'd sent it back. The broccoli rabe was good, though. We chose two pasta dishes as our main courses. We kind of enjoyed the gnocchi in a ground meat and tomato sauce; the gnocchi themselves weren't too heavy (although I've certainly had lighter), and the sauce was tasty enough, albeit slightly peppery. Unfortunately, the orrechiette with sausage and broccoli rabe was swimming in olive oil. After dinner, we consulted the Rao's cookbook that was for sale in the store adjoining the restaurant and guessed that there was probably twice the amount of oil in our dish than was called for in its recipe. Again, the broccoli rabe was tasty, but the sausage was overcooked. We paid far too much for this food, too.  Some good stuff: Friendly, mostly attentive service. Nice decor. Fun, kitschy music from different decades. Stay away if you want truly top-notch Italian food in Vegas, though.",

It left us having to do a lot of math to try and split up our own check and after an hour of trying to do that our check still ended up being short and someone had to pay ten extra dollars for their meal. On top of that they only allowed 6 debits cards?! A girl didn't know what to do at our table because all she brought was a debit card to pay with. For a restaurant in the middle of Caesars palace Las Vegas, they need to learn how to split up the checks. By the end of the meal everyone was frustrated with having spent an extra hour there trying to split up the check that it ruined everyone's evening. Everyone ended up fighting with each other over the check issue and it just wasn't worth it. When we talked to the manager about it she was extremely rude and didn't even help us. I mean geez the least she could do was give us a free bottle of wine or something. Absolutely ridiculous and everyone should avoid this restaurant by all means. I'll never be returning.",

We were so excited to go to Rao's for dinner and was quickly disappointed with the meal.  The antipasta & meatball appetizer was good. The five of us had the worst Italian meal ever. I had the famous Lemon Chicken - reminded me more like they caught a pigeon. Extremely dry with not even a sprig of parsely to dress up the plate - no sides came with it. The lemon sauce was extremely sour - they should just get rid of this dish. Our bill was close to $500 which included two bottles of wine - what a waste of money! Carmine's is opening up at Caesars soon - Rao's close your doors - here comes real Italian food!  Stay away!",

I assume the draw is partly subliminal - when I lived in NYC I called the one there a couple times for a reservation, was told \"call back next year\", and we go through 5 - 6 large jars of their pasta sauce every month.  the food is good, but not great, Italian.  The buffalo mozzarella in the appetizer is excellent.  The service is good but the waiters have an annoying habit of sitting down at your table - so now if I go with an odd number of people, I always move the extra chair to another table.  The deserts are good, but the one time I ordered grappa it was the gasoline-harsh kind.  Also one time the cast of the View sat at the table next to us - which would have been very exciting had Star Jones still been around",

    "text": "I have waited to give this place a second visit before writing a review, because the first visit (Jan 09) was so stellar that it was almost too good to be True. The second visit was a little more than a solid 3 star (especially when considering the price), so I think I'll be generous with the average and maybe give this place one more shot before moving on to other high-end dining in Las Vegas.   In fact, I was just in NYC last month, but I didn't even bother to call Rao's as I knew it was futile.....I was geared up for my trip to Las Vegas in the coming weeks.  As mentioned, the first visit was phenomenal. The service was almost too attentive, our waiter told us about the history of Rao's (I grew up in CT, kinda of knew, but not really), gave us an excellent rundown of the menu and allowed us to be unpretentious with our wine choices. Two of us were sat in a booth in a busy, but sociable room off to the left side.   We went for the full-bellied Italian order of the Mozzarella in Carrozza, arugula salad, veal parm (on the bone!), with the tomato and ham vodka cream pasta. Oh, and don't forget the meatballs and gravy.....   Although we were in a food coma (need to upload picture to prove it), we enjoyed the meal and wine thoroughly (and dreamt about the meatballs for months). We couldn't wait to come again.   Our next visit was in July 09. We had a Caesar's concierge make our reservations and dined at a more reasonable hour before 9pm. Although the house was packed, we had a very competent, but indifferent waiter who may have spent too many years in the business to add anything special to the experience. With no other guidance other than \"whataya want?\", we fumbled our way without an app (no recommendation, no order), warm white wine (I had face my trashy side and put ice cubes in the wine) an uninspiring salad, and somehow, the \"parm and balls\" just didn't hit the same high notes. After moving to red, we didn't even finish the bottle.   Maybe it was the summer season, the heat taking it's toll, the down economy on Vegas, or something hidden, but the place didn't have the twinkle of that first visit.   Oh Rao's, if you want America to buy those sauces and pastas now found from Kroger to Shop Rite, you better give people a memorable experience in your carnival sized restaurant.   Alas, I'll give it one more try, if I'm not broke off playing craps by the time dinner rolls around that evening....",

    "text": "We ate here with some of my boyfriend's hometown friends. The food  was pretty decent, all fresh-tasting Italian. The vodka pasta the other couple mostly split was well-seasoned and wonderful, but not really worth the price tag. The steak with warmed tomatoes, one of the veal dishes, and a broccolini/sweet sausage pasta dish rounded out the meal...all very good dishes, but nothing outstanding or really that memorable. I love Italian food and pasta, but Rao's was a tad overpriced. The portions were large, but the 4 of us opted to share everything \"family-style,\" to taste more dishes...which I also HIGHLY reccomend. I think if we had all picked one dish, we either would have been bored, disappointed, or spent too much and had too much left over to order courses.   The waiter was extremely knowledgable about the food, restaurant, chef, wine, etc....but he was sort of obnoxious and in our faces and too much....It was also a little strange to me how much information he went on about...at a nicer place like that, to just assume all of the diners were idiots with an utter lack of food knowledge was a little strange. The waiter often explained dishes and items to us, like describing the different levels of doneness for steak, explaining that broccolini is bitter, etc...I think maybe a different table of people might have loved his comments better, but oh well. All in all this place was just ok, not somewhere I'd bring friends in town to, but I would absolutely eat here meeting people.",

Outside of the prompt service, I can't say much else positive about Rao. My Gnocchi was fine (but nothing special) and the Veal, Beef, and Pork combo sauce that it was served with was best described by one of my co-patrons, \"It tastes like Ragu!\" The meatballs were good, but again, not great. The highlight of our meal was probably the ample amount of bread that was served along with a very tasty bottle of olive oil.  In my unprofessional opinion, Rao is a place that gained notoriety not for its food, but for the smallness of its original location in New York. Any restaurant that charges many thousands of dollars to \"buy\" its tables for the year is bound to create buzz and I believe Rao Las Vegas has ridden that buzz all the way from Harlem. If you're in Vegas for a month, Rao might be a viable dinner stop for your trip, but for the majority of Vegas tourists, your money is MUCH better spent elsewhere.",

We ordered a few meatballs and the waitress was quite literal when she said baseball sized!  eat up here especially when the office is pickup the tab, otherwise spend you money on the crap tables...",

The wife and i ordered the filet mignon and the fried mozzarella. The steak was cooked perfectly medium, with a tasty risotto (although a little salty).  The decor seems like a cheesy pizza joint with all the pictures on the wall, and the place seems centered around their bar.",

We sat outside in the closest table near a public ramp so unfortunately, with 6 girls, we had a lot of unwanted male visits to our table while the guys were on their way into the place. Aside from this, our dining experience was great. The service was wonderful and the food was great. It was pretty big portions and the flavors were awesome. I had the meatballs which had me at bite one. They are the most moist, flavorful, meatballs you will ever eat. Others had some pasta dishes and also the salmon but the highlight of my meal were the meatballs. There were 2 in a dish and each were the size of baseballs. Remember to share when you go here or you won't be able to go clubbing afterwards on your full tummy!",

    "text": "A comfy bar stool and small lunch menu were just what I needed when I walk into Rao's for a super late lunch.   The trick to eating well in Vegas is finding a place that has decent food without the insane tourist prices - I think Rao's is one of these places.   I sat down, famished from a hard day's work (no, seriously) I spent a week in Vegas working, not gambling or partying like most. For this reason I could appreciate the dark wood colors and dim lighting in this restaurant.   Essentially the reason why I'm giving Rao's such high stars is because their server was efficient, their food was good and I didn't blow my whole per-diem in one sitting. Actually, I lie, there's more to Rao's than that, there is an amazing Caesar Salad, yes salad.   Anyone who knows me knows that while I enjoy the ingredients that go into making salads, the dish just loses its appeal once they've all been tossed together. That was not the case here, the huge shaves of parmesan cheese, delicious crispy croutons and fresh tasty dressing made this salad a memorable one.   Thank you Rao's, your comfy chair and no nonsense lunch menu saved my tummy!",

I  had to cover the entire thing is cheese just to get it down. PS they gave me boxed spaghetti for over $30 a plate I should be getting home made pasta. I tried the meatballs as well ...... They where ok, maybe if i grew up in ohio I might think this was a good meatball..... The only thing they had going was clearly thy had spent some time in sauce so they where tender.

We had to find another waiter up get us drinks.. I guess no effort when you automatically get 18%? The food was subpar. For $85 a person the portions were tiny. The calamari and salad were fine. The pasta was bland and noodles were undercooked. The entrees were tiny to share and not much flavor. The meatballs were average, the lemon chicken had no flavor and the veal was eh. The desserts were ok but again nothing special. With the service and the food I won't ever return here again, especially for a larger event with a preset menu.., way overpriced for the quality.",

Nothing personal Rao's, but being a huge fan of Italian food, you were not the best; you weren't even very close, and yes I've had Italian food all over LA, Vegas, and New York.  Don't get me wrong, I absolutely loved the decor and feel of this place, but our server was a little on the pretentious side, as were his recommendations, and the restaurant's pricing. The price you pay for the quality you receive is pretty outrageous, even for Vegas.  Of all the items ordered, the only thing that truly stood out was the meatball everyone talks about. They can sure make a good meatball. But all the pasta dishes were average, the antipasti dish was just okay, and the wine list while decent in selection, was close to double and/or triple what we have paid at other Vegas restaurants, and in New York.

    "text": "First, a lesson. The name of this restaurant does not rhyme with \"Wows\". It's more like \"RAY-Oh's\". And now you know. Feel free to click that little \"Useful\" button down below.  Atmospherically speaking, Rao's is very nice. Warm, clean, inviting. Sort of homey, if you lived in a really nice home. With lots of people eating in it.  Foodwise, Rao's is merely good, in my opinion. The pasta I had was fine, but there wasn't anything to really set it off from a bunch of other Italian restaurants I've been to. And it's pricey too. The average pasta price was around $24. A moderately sized side of spinach was $14. Yes, I realize price around here is as much a factor of location as anything else, but even factoring that in I don't think the price is QUITE justified.   The service was good. Our waitress had good recommendations and water & ice tea glasses were refilled properly.  Something else useful to know (hint, hint) is that while it doesn't say so on the menu, you can get half portions of pasta for a little more ($2 I think) than half the price of the full portion. I made a meal out of two half pastas, and it was enough food. They also give you plenty of bread. My friend's chicken dish was also quite big. If you aren't super hungry you could probably split an appetizer and an entree between two people, which would make Rao's a bit more affordable.  I'm a little torn between 3 & 4 stars, but at the end of the day I'm not ready to call myself a fan.",

    "text": "Service - our waitress was great.  Friendly and informative, not phony and was honest and available when needed.  I feel bad for her as she is not responsible for the fact the restaurant lacks the basics for a really good Italian restaurant.  Decor - good view of the pool from our table a bit dark but overall decent atmosphere  Food/Drink - someone is getting cheap on the wine.  When you order a glass of wine that costs $17, you expect at least a good pour.  I felt like they poured the final remains of a bottle and didn't want to open another.  I felt cheated.  The bread/crispy lavish cheesy things were good.  Their meatballs were yummy.  Vodka and cream sauce penne was just ok.  Linguini & clams was awful.  I know it's seafood but when you bite into a bowl of this dish, it tasted like the ocean.  I have had this dish dozens of times but this one I could not eat.  It was too spicy like cracked pepper spicy and it was \"fishy\"  I have never not finished a plate linguini and this one I just could not stomach.  Thank goodness the waitress was kind enough to take the charge off of our bill.  We are not ones to complain too much so that is why we didn't speak up originally about this dish.  Dessert - Tiramisu was yummy.  As we walked out, a nice big roach was crawling across the carpet.  Nothing worse than seeing one of these critters actually where people are dining as you know there are probably more in the back.  I know restaurants have a hard time controlling this but to see it in the actual restaurant made me lose my appetite.  I guess expect more especially at a place that charges this much for ok to sub-standard food.",

The host is usually your first impression of a restaurant. If I don't like it then I just walk out. Angela which was my server was quick to come to my table to introduce herself. I asked her a few questions about the menu since it was my first time and she gave me her advice. I got the Shrimp and lobster pasta which she recommended and let me tell you... I loved it. The portions are big and it's a really good price. I asked her advice on a good wine to company the food and I was so happy. I would definitely recommend Raos if you want to eat good and be full. I was sad that I ate so much I wasn't able to try the desert but I plan to come back on my next visit to Vegas. Thanks to everyone in the restaurant that made my experience so wonderful. Oh and love the decor and music.",

    "text": "I've never eaten at an Olive Garden.  If Rao's had been one, I would have walked out with a couple of hundred dollars more in my pocket, and said it was okay.  But grading on a price to dining experience ratio, not so much.  Look, I know that every restaurant at Caesar's Palace is overpriced, and I'm perfectly willing to overpay for a great dinner, but this was overpaying for a mediocre dinner.  We started with Frito Misto for the table.  A couple of bites convinced me to save my appetite for the next course.  It's not that it was bland.  It had flavor.  It's just that it had flavors I didn't care for.  So on to the first course special - Pasta Fagioli.  Dean Martin claims that this dish should make me drool like I'm in love, but it was pretty much just a bowl of soup.  My main course was the bone-in veal parm, which was huge.  That made it a bit of a waste, since I left most of it on the plate, and declined an offer to take the rest home in a doggy bag.  I knew I could whip up something for tomorrow night's dinner that would taste much better.   I also had a side of Quattro Fromagi pasta - large pasta shells with no noticeable cheese flavor and, come to think of it, no particular flavor at all.  In short, I just wasn't impressed. Neither was the rest of our table.  My wife had a pasta dish, which she described as \"acceptable.\"  One of our friends had chicken, which he called \"a waste.\"  Our other friend had a steak, on which he didn't comment.  The room was a bit cramped.  The walls were completely covered with photographs of people who, I guess, you had to be a New Yorker to recognize.  I certainly didn't.  Service was attentive, but a bit rushed.  The goal seemed to be quick turnaround of the table, rather than facilitating a relaxing dining experience.  So the whole thing was disappointing.  If my veal parm had cost $22, I probably wouldn't have minded leaving most of it on the plate.  But at $53 I expected something top notch.  This wasn't it.  My suggestion:  If you want a high-end and fairly priced Italian meal, go a mile off the strip to Piero's Italian Cuisine.",

    "text": "Rao's may not win big points for creating the most imaginative dishes or the most powerful flavors but it makes for where it counts with really consistent, solid food that is worth eating all-around!    The coworkers and I went family style - sharing several fine dishes.  The giant meatball side (you get 2) could be it's own meal.  Topped with some Parmesan cheese, the meatballs are excellent.  We also got a special - a linguini pasta with crab and a light fettucini/olive oil sauce.  The clams as well were delicious - a little on the smaller side but full of flavor and baked to perfection.  The food amount for the most part nearly worked out too - hitting the middle ground for a good-sized portion for sharing or eating alone.  Additionally, you get a bunch of different types of bread like olive bread to a cracker that you can dip in your own olive oil/balsamic vinaigrette!  We ended the meal with profiteroles that were drenched in chocolate sauce - it was a great finish.  The price for all of these dishes ended up about $50 per person - not too shabby when you think about the amount of food we were hitting up.  The server was super super friendly and the staff were diligent about refilling water and taking away plates after they were done.  The seating we had was nice as well - right by the pool that in the Winter was closed and made for a nice, serene view.  Seating seems pretty plentiful as well as a nice middle circle bar.  To find Rao's, it'll be deeper into the Casino by the Bacchanal and a sushi stand (as well as a dessert place across the way).     Rao's isn't the best Italian I've ever bad but it sure is plentiful and tasty enough to just make you enjoy yourself in Vegas.  The prices aren't exorbitant and you feel like you're being treated well.  If you're looking for Italian and a nice place on the Strip, Rao's is solid all-around.",

Once seated, our waiter knew from the reservation that I would be seeing a show inside of the Colosseum. She sat down next to my table and pulled up a chair. She was genuinely nice and wanted to make sure my dinner experience was the best it could be. She asked a few key food questions. After that, an on the spot custom menu was created by pointing out exactly what I would enjoy.   She correctly picked the calamari for the first course. It came with excellent marinara sauce.  The second course was an arugula salad with pear strips, candied walnuts and parmesan cheese shavings.   The third and final tasty course was the 17 oz perfectly cooked NY Strip Steak. It was crusted on the side via spices and olive oil. The steak was juicy through to the last piece.   Thanks to Caesar's Palace for making the arrangements for dinner before I went to go see a show in the Colosseum. I had not visited Rao's before that night for a complete dinner, but I had been there for an event with small appetizers and mini desserts.  I recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants a delicious steak, calamari (which is difficult to cook correctly) and a light salad.",

Purse ravioli was yummy and hubs loved the bolognase sauce. Dinner was a little over $200 for 2 peeps. Ambiance was issue - very loud music, large and loud tables, could barely understand waiter, felt like I was in a diner as opposed to \"expensive\" restaurant - attire is very casual, flip flops and shorts on most patrons on a sat night, so that kinda ruined it too. For the price I shouldn't have to yell across the table and the cash man photo lady came while I was eating my appetizer and was loud and a little pushy - 2 5*7 photos are $40.  I would return, but not for an elegant meal",

My water glass was always full, my wine seemed to be bottomless - from the time we walked up (without reservation) we did not have to wait for anything besides dinner itself. Per the recommendation of my dinner companion he suggested the stuffed shells for our entree and for our appetizer I ordered (my favorite) caprese salad, it was fresh, creamy and delicious. Once our entree came out, I agreed with my companion that the sauce smelt fantastic! We enjoyed as much as we possibly could of this creamy, basil filled, stuffed shells dish before we had to ask the waiter to wrap our leftovers.

Her response in a very bitchy manner \"we are all booked for the evening.\" Funny b/c we looked around and there were quite a few empty tables. So we continued to ask her, is there anyway you could squeeze us in (yes we were hungry and didn't want to go searching for another place we could all agree on!). Again she just gave us a snooty \"no.\"   My friend decided to take a walk in the back of the restaurant by the bar and saw a friendly waiter who told us that we could sit anywhere in the bar - open seating. SO why didn't the biatch in the front tell us that? We immediately found a table and sat. I was a little disappointed in the vegetarian options. I got the special of the day (some sort of ravioli with mushrooms and spinach). I didn't love it. One of my friends really liked her vodka pasta dish. The other girl in the group had to send her pasta dish back b/c it was way to Al Dente.   Overall, over priced food, huge portions of pasta, but nothing special about the taste.",

    "text": "I'm surprised at the negativity of some of the reviews below.  The common theme in the reviews is that this restaurant is crazy expensive.  Hello -- welcome to Vegas!  Even the frickin' Starbucks have marked up their prices in Vegas.  Doesn't that tell anyone beside me anything?  Okay, and so once you 'get' that things are pricier in Vegas, how does Rao's do?  Firstly, I don't know the NYC location.  Never heard of this 'chain' until I stumbed upon this Vegas location.  What made our experience special --  -- is that we were initially sat in the inner room, with the dark booths -- a vintage flavored Eyetalian restaurant.  If I had been sat more outside in the cafe area, I'm convinced I wouldn't have enjoyed it as much.  Next I had the only waiter I've ever asked the name of and requested on returns trips.  Yup -- I won't eat at this place unless I'm inside and being served by this dude.  Really nice guy.  Won't give his name or I may jam up my little secret hideaway.  Next up is the bread they drop on the table.  Hello.  My God niece's jaw dropped like a rock when that hit the table.  She's a carb addict and was in instant heaven.  I was in heaven watching her in heaven.  So then we order.  It doesn't matter exactly what we ordered because everything is essentially the same quality here:  somewhere between B+ to an A-.  To get an A or A+, they'd have to serve uniquely distinctive dishes with bigger portions.  But they don't because they're taking the french bistro 'less is more' thing instead of the old school 'giant portions of mediocrity'.   So the clam pasta was good, but not amazing.  The manicotti solid but not stunning.  The gnocchi definitely tasty but not ambrosia.  Understand, I tried the Onda Italian restaurant inside the Mirage.  Similar prices.  Food is between B- to B+.  But the windowless big room prohibitively claustrophobic -- as in, why sit here unless in a hurry? Service okay but not as enthusiastic as Caesar's.  CPK inside the Mirage probably offers the best value of all three places, but you're sitting IN the casino with all the thick cheesy cigarette smoke.    So what is so terrible about Rao's again?   Not much.  They claimed the gnocchi were made fresh, but I'm not buying that.  The clams were tiny in the pasta, but voluminous, and the sauce with subtle and spicy.  If I were the manager of this place, I'd make the menu much smaller but everything simply amazing.  I'd use the Tao restaurant as a guide.    But I've been told the Tao owners opened an Italian joint in Palazzo, called Lavo.  Guess what?  No, go ahead, guess.  That's right -- Yelpers say it's only so-so and way over-priced.  Get it?  Got it?  Good.  Enjoy.  UPDATE:  Had the Shrimp Scampi here.  A simply sinful ball of pasta with four BIG shrimp on top.  Not only my new favorite here, but with the Sea Bass at the TAO probably one of the favorite dishes in Vegas (so far).",

The salmon was also perfectly cooked, but the quinoa that came with it was bland. A must try is the calamari appetizer. The calamari is so soft I've never had any like it. The service though was on the slow side. My husband had to walk to the bar to get a second drink as we could not get a hold of our waiter to get another one.",

The staff was so stiff and stale it left me feeling uncomfortable, and ultimately unwelcome. I don't think I saw a single person smile in that restaurant.  Especially not the 2 hostesses that stared at me upon my arrival. No hello or welcome was given. The worst part was when the bill came, our server and both hostesses seemed to be standing over our table, as if we were planning on skipping out on the check. I was uncomfortable, but once my mom pointed out the odd behavior I knew it was time to leave.    Needless to say, I will not be returning to Rao's and more importantly I will not recommend it to any friends, family, guests, or tourists I encounter.",

Our waiter described how they are made first by pan frying them with olive oil and then baking them in the oven with half marinara sauce and half water to allow both the steam and the heat to cook the meatballs from inside out.  The penne with vodka sauce is just how I imagined it and uses their world-famous vodka sauce to do it! This is truly an experience! Ask for extra vodka sauce if you order this!  The lasagna is also soft and moist! It's really hard to describe how perfect the flavors blend together as well as how the pasta is cooked. It was really great.  The overall service was perfect! They took care of my party and met all of our needs. They even described the room and pictures in the room that is the exact replica of the one in New York! He also described the outside of the restaurant and how it replicates the one in New York with the two street signs that are perpendicular to the restaurant as well as how the view would look in front of it!  People were dressed casually in shorts while others were dressed in business casual. Overall, a great dinner to have in Vegas!",

On the first bite angels sang. I nearly cancelled the Osso Buco for more meatballs. The braised veal shank with saffron risotto always pleases the palate, but the meatballs!  I highly recommend both.  On other visits we have had the veal scallopini (with marsala), ravioli purses, chicken saltimbocca and a few others over the years. We have loved every dish.

    "text": "3.5 stars  Met up with a couple friends here because this was their favorite Italian place to hit up every time they're in Vegas. Only heard nothing but good things about Rao's from the Food Network and on an episode of the Travel Channel's The Best Of, so I was stoked to finally get a chance to check it out.   Unfortunately, the head chef (ex-wife of the Rao's owner) Carla Pelligrino no longer runs the kitchen. I think that might've had something to do with some of the lackluster dishes we were served that night.   Of course my boys and I had to get liquored up on some bread and booze while waiting for our appetizers.  Alcohol is pricey, but expected when you're in Vegas.  What I didn't expect was how little alcohol was detected in our mixed drinks:  - 2008 Chianti Classico Cecchi ($55) - Dirty Vodka Martini ($15.50) - Grey Goose Pear Martini ($13) - Chilled Belvedere Vodka shots ($12.50)  The cracker bread was the best part of the bread basket. Everything else seemed stale. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/KkmPDIWzvwbBpyqOHT6pcQ?select=lhclSBefk34_8wOpgIbVCQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/KkmP...</a>  BRUSCHETTA (4 pcs for $17): Thinly sliced crunchy crostinis topped off with  1) Tomato & Basil: Needed a touch of salt and some acid  2) Marinated Artichokes: My piece still had the inedible fibrous hairy part of \"choke\" still intact. Not very lady-like of me to have to spit this out in front of the hot waiter walking by. Ugh. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/KkmPDIWzvwbBpyqOHT6pcQ?select=R1ToPCJRYPVb8V-mtDhCsg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/KkmP...</a>  RAO'S MEATBALLS (side order of 2 fist-sized meatballs for $16): The first thing people mention when talking about Rao's is their famous traditional meatballs served with their house marinara sauce.  Combining the right ratio of ground veal, pork and lean beef with pecorino cheese makes it oh-so flavorful and meaty!   My only complaint was that it was a bit on the dry side. Thank goodness for the marinara sauce!  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/KkmPDIWzvwbBpyqOHT6pcQ?select=dvcpo1Yh_IV7W-59ZsjcGQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/KkmP...</a>  ORECCHIETTE CON BROCCOLI RAPPE (sweet italian sausage, broccoli rabe and garlic sauteed in extra virgin olive oil, $26):  I enjoyed the sweet italian sausage very much. The casing had a fantastic bite to it, while the sausage itself remained oh-so-juicy and seasoned perfectly. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/KkmPDIWzvwbBpyqOHT6pcQ?select=TK0ZVflco6pR06oWzxkEtQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/KkmP...</a>  Everything else was not up to par: 1) The orecchiette pasta was undercooked. There were a bunch of them still stuck in hard undercooked clusters of 2 or 3 pieces. Imagine every forkful being hard and chewy.  2) The broccoli rabe was so damn bitter that it threw off the entire dish. I LOVE broccoli rabe, it's bitterness is what makes it unique. But this was the first time I've had it overpower an entire dish.  ***A quick 1 min blanch prior to throwing it into the pasta would've saved this dish***  SPAGHETTI ALLA BOLOGNESE ($27): Ground beef, pork and veal (same mixture and tastes as their meatballs) cooked with San Marzano Tomatoes and herbs.   These particular plum tomatoes are less acidic and sweeter when compared to the usual Roma tomatoes used by most Italian places, so I could see how Rao's chose this for their tasty marinara and bolognese sauce.  Would've been a perfect dish if it weren't for the overcooked pasta.  RIGATONI FILETTO DI POMODORO (pancetta, sweet white onions and lots of black pepper, $25): The same same San Marzano tomato sauce was used. The rigatoni was undercooked. But I could forgive that since there was a good amount of pancetta in the sauce.  Served with a light dusting of pecorino cheese, we asked for extra cheese to cover the entire dish, lol! This pasta dish needed the extra saltiness from the pecorino cheese, trust.",

Rao's as a strong reputation to live up to and considering it is just about impossible to reserve a table at their NYC location I was looking forward to dining here.  I arrived for an early dinner with a colleague and we elected to dine on their patio (people watching is great at Caesars Palace) so we did not get to experience the NYC style restaurant inside. Right up front service was fantastic. Our server was very knowledgeable regarding the chef specials, their wine, and very patient and agreeable as we customized our entrees.   From start to finish the food was exceptional. Start off with fresh bread and their homemade butter while you attempt to pair down your dinner choices. I opted for the Caesar salad with fresh cheese and extra anchovies. My dining companion's caprese salad is a great choice as well.  I selected the linguine and clam sauce with white sauce. The clams were small Manila clams. The dish was spiced with, noticeable, garlic, white wine, & red pepper. After devouring my dinner I finished off the wonderful sauce with their bread. Absolutely exceptional!  My dining companion had the Bolognese with penne pasta she reported bliss as well.  Rao's is indeed pricey but well worth it if you care to experience a wonderful traditional Italian fare.",

The first thing is the Meatballs. While most will never get to experience them in New York, I will tell you there is no better. Anywhere. Here they were fine. Way overpriced but fine. Ordered the Lemon Chicken that they are famous for. Almost as good as the original but just off. Mozzerella in Corroza was close to the least tasty I have had anywhere. Pasta was perfectly Al Dente and the red sauce was better then average. To many choices here in Vegas. Won't make a special trip to return.",

I have been here three times and it is the only dish I have ever ordered because it is so good. The bread and butter they serve prior to your entrees is great. The butter is like non other and has a distinct flavor. The scenery throughout the restaurant is very nice and is a True italian feel.   The service was okay, which is normal for me being in my mid twenties in an upscale place.   The portions here are very generous and you can usually take some of it back to your hotel room and have yourself a very rich 2:00 am snack after a night of drinking.   Rao's is one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas. It's also way easier to get into compared to the NYC location.",

    "text": "We have enjoyed a lot of amazing meals in Las Vegas over the years, including this last trip. This was not one of them. This was our first time trying Rao's. We have been wanting to try it in New York, but we are not celebrities so that's never going to happen. On this trip we decided to use one of our precious evenings for dinner here to finally try it out. I cannot tell you how incredibly disappointing it was. The minute we walked in and were seated I had a bad feeling. The room we were in was extremely claustrophobic, loud, and just didn't smell very clean. I had to shout to talk to my husband. The service was average at best, nothing more than you would get in any kind of a chain restaurant. But the food was the real problem. We started with the meatballs. I grew up eating pasta and meatballs, and I know good red sauce. The meatballs themselves were okay.  Not amazing but not awful. The sauce was not good, bland, and that pretty much ruined the appetizer. I did not even finish mine and that says a lot. Let's not forget the bread. The bread itself was nothing special at all. -  just OK, but the large crackers in the bread basket were terrible. They literally tasted like stale saltines. I tried the ravioli purses and they were actually not bad. I will give them three stars. I would have to have them again but they were just average - nothing I would ever seek out. On the other hand, my husband had spaghetti Bolognese and it was pretty terrible. It was a massive bowl of pasta with substandard sauce. I tasted it and frankly, pasta that's not fresh out of the box tastes as good if not better. It was a massive letdown. Quantity does not make up for quality. I will happily pay more than $30 a dish for GOOD pasta but this was overpriced trash. For dessert we tried the profiteroles, something we have had before many times elsewhere. The pastry was gross, not fresh, dry, hard to eat even. I didn't finish mine. For me not to finish dessert is unheard of. I would say the only good thing about this meal was that I tried it and I am no longer curious, and maybe that I did not leave feeling like I overate! Give it a skip.",

I called to let them know I was lost at 10:01pm and the hostess put me on hold to ask the manager if they would seat us once we found the restaurant, as she stated had been done before. I was hung up on and when I called back she told me the manager would not accommodate us and would turn us away if we arrived.   I am extremely disappointed in this experience and urge anyone with good taste in restaurants to avoid this establishment that treats their customers with such disrespect and disregard.

    "text": "Tough to arrive at a rating for Rao's.  Several things were done really well, some things were done okay, one thing was really bad, and the service wasn't great.  But, overall it was more good (or very good) than bad, so here we arrive at a 4 star rating.  We had reservations for 8 on a Friday.  We arrived promptly and only had to wait a couple of minutes while they set our table up.  We didn't love the placement of our table, it was like it was put in the middle of a dining room as an afterthought.  Not much room to maneuver, and other tables were all on top of us, so we asked to move and were accommodated.  The server brought us water and a wine list.  The wine list is above average for the Strip, and the prices are what you'd expect to pay.  Appropriately, there were several Italian wines on the list.  The somm was great, he came over and offered some assistance and was very friendly.  The bread service is good, it's served with 3 types of butter.  My favorite was the red pepper.  To start, we had 2 appetizers (baked clams and bruschetta) and two pastas (linguine with white claim sauce and rigatoni filletto).  The appetizers were average, probably one of the least impressive parts of the meal.  The baked clams were mostly bread crumbs, and they were over-salted.  They did have a nice crust on top from the broiler.  The bruschetta was good and fresh, but I could have used more balsamic. It was very basic.   Of the pastas, the linguine was vastly superior.  It was loaded with clams and the white wine sauce was great.  Cooked perfectly as well.  I considered ordering another order of this as a side dish, it was that good.  The rigatoni was too far on the other spectrum of al dente for me.  It had way too much bite.  And, the sauce didn't have the flavors we expected from the menu description:  pancetta, white onion, tomatoes, pecorino romano.  It tasted like a basic tomato sauce, I didn't get any taste of pancetta.  Had the pasta been cooked maybe a minute longer it would have been much better, but I wouldn't get this again.  For my entree, I ordered the veal parm.  But, our group is big on sharing dishes, so I also tried Uncle Vincent's lemon chicken, this chicken dish with peppers and sausage, and the pasta special of the evening, which was lobster and shrimp in a fra diavolo sauce.  We also got an order of meatballs to share.  As many Yelpers note, the meatballs are massive, softball size.  So, 2 of them was plenty for a group of 4, we each probably had nearly a half-pound of meatball to eat.  The entrees, in my order of preference:  veal parm, chicken with sausage and peppers, Uncle Vincent's, and the seafood pasta.  The veal chop is huge, thin, and breaded well.  You really don't need a knife, I cut it with my fork at least half the time.  It's covered in marinara and cheese.  It certainly isn't re-inventing the wheel, but it's a fantastic version of a classic dish.  The table loved it.  The chicken and peppers was good, with both being cooked well.  But, the star was the sausage.  Some of the best Italian sausage I can remember having, and it wasn't overcooked, so it retained some juiciness.  I can see why Uncle Vincent's is popular.  The chicken is prepared very well and is juicy.  I'm just not a huge lemon chicken guy, so the dish was lost on me.  But, I was glad to try one of Rao's more famous (which is saying something) dishes.  The fra diavolo was a miss.  It had no heat at all.  It was a watery tomato sauce with the seafood.  They would have been way better off just using the house marinara.  Very disappointing.  The guy that ordered it picked out all the seafood and then supplemented his dinner with stuff from our plates.    The meatballs have earned their reputation.  They are tender, moist, and very flavorful.  Just incredible.  Nothing more needs to be said that hasn't been said in decades about these things.  Just order them when you go, even if you just have a couple of bites.  Like I said, service was spotty.  At one point, we counted during an hour and we saw the somm more than we saw our server.  The restaurant was busy, but I am guessing that a place like Rao's is always busy.  That being said, for the most part the food was very good, and I would eat here again.",

    "text": "Ate here with some coworkers and it was the worst experience I've had at a food establishment in a nice hotel. Myself and some coworkers were here for a conference and came here to eat on our last night and was given some gift cards to expense our meals. We asked the waiter Howard if he could do separate checks since we are traveling on business. Howard straight up said, \"No because I always get shorted.\" I've worked in the food industry and all of the people I was with are managers in the customer service industry so we know how to tip. He said he could run our cards separately but would not split the check. We then had to figure out what each person had and write down the amount for him to run on each card. As we are figuring everything out, Howard starts talking about us to the manager (a female), then another waiter or buss boy walked to him and they both were talking about our table because I saw Howard point to our table. Then another worker walks towards them and he starts telling them about us too. Working in the customer service industry everything is about the customers perception and he should have taken his conversation out of our view.   The food wasn't great either so it's not like that was going to save this rating. The pasta that had seafood in it was extremely fishy. If I could give negative stars, I would.   I would recommend going to Trevi at the forum shops, the food and service is excellent there!",

Later that night, the two husbands got violently sick, almost to the point on being incapacitated. We had eaten the same food all day, except the husbands ate Rao's meatballs at dinner. That is not why I am writing this review. In the restaurant business, stuff happens   The next day we called Rao's to let them know what had happened. We weren't looking for anything. We thought they should know. We gave all of our information to the manager. She told us that someone from their Risk Management Dept. would call us. NEVER HAPPENED! She also told us that after they investigated someone would follow up with us. NEVER HAPPENED!  The lack of concern, compassion and communication was astounding. This was not about bad meatballs! It is about basic customer service. We will never go there again. Oh, thats right, Rao's doesn't care!",

The bartender said it was a big portion and it would be enough to share but it wasn't. $44 for a single portion, that wasn't anything special.   Second visit- We started with the meatballs ($19) and they were delicious! The waitress said they were a must have and I see why! I ordered the lasagna ($32) this time and it was a good size portion and yummy! Also, the bread is amazing! I was afraid I was going to be full before the food came out lol!",

The Las Vegas Rao's is not the same as walking into the Harlem Rao's in NYC and why would you want it to be! You can't recreate an original, but you can stir up a feeling, an energy and an atmosphere - this is what Las Vegas does.   Everything is bigger in Vegas - including Rao's! Walking through Ceasar's Palace you can't miss Rao's. The iconic red corner restaurant greets you past the slot machines. While I did not make a reservation I would suggest you do so if you are trying to make a show or go during prime dinner/lunch service.  I chose to eat at the bar since I was solo. After taking my seat and ordering wine, I remembered the late Frankie Pellegrino telling me there was a recreation of the NYC Rao's in Vegas and asked the bartender which room it was - sure enough there it was! It is pretty spot on with the exception of the bar is missing and the regulars are still in NYC - look up the history of this restaurant you won't be disappointed.   I returned to my seat at the bar placed my order and the servers started their cadence - wine came out, placemat, silverware, bread basket w/gourmet butters and my napkin - if you want full service come here!  Shortly after diving into the bread basket my ravioli followed from the kitchen. The portion was well worth the price and I was full all day! If I wasn't in the midst of conversation (and in a public place) I would have licked the bowl.   The menu is pricey so keep this in mind, but it is delicious and will not disappoint. You are paying for an experience that many people will not ever have - while it is not as exclusive as NYC it is still an extension of Rao's, an extension of the family. Enjoy!",

DINNER RESERVATIONS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!! This place is very busy!  I ordered:  *ANTIPASTI Fritto Misto (fried calamari, cod fish, shrimp and zucchini) $24 I was a little hesitant about this mix but it exceeded my expectations. The shrimp are gigantic and the calamari was fried perfectly. Sharing recommended because it's a great portion size.  *PRIMI Spinach & Ricotta Ravioli $30 These ravioli are a great vegetarian entree. The Ravioli were pretty large and equally delicious.   *Bottle of Pinot Grigio $60  *The meatballs are huge and my friend enjoyed them greatly $19   I would definitely return in the near future",

We finished dinner with a Tiramisu that was perfect. Dinner was heavenly.",

The food at this very expensive restaurant was just average.  Absolutely not worth the $350.00 the check came to for 2 people.  Way, way overrated and overpriced  for mediocre Italian food. Many far better options on or near the strip for significantly less money. I wont be back. Mike S. Henderson",

    "text": "This place was so bad. I'm really disappointed that we wasted our money.  We were staying at Caeser's Palace and didn't want to step outside of the hotel that night, and RAO's was recommended to us by the hotel staff. They spoke really highly about the meatballs. I like a good meatball and that's usually hard to mess up. Heck, I even like frozen meatballs from the grocery. So, we order the meatballs which was $20 for two meatballs (eye roll). I'm going to try really hard to find the positive. It was airy. The negative? Of course, the price but that would've been okay if it was actually good. Instead, it was flavorless. I tried really hard to finish it because even the server was going on and on about how amazing their meatballs were. I couldn't finish it though. It tasted like water. Basically, it tasted like nothing. Next came a beef lasagna but it was whatever. Just a regular beef lasagna which was also too pricey at $36, I think? We couldn't finish that either, not because it was huge but because it was just average. You can get better quality at my local Italian diner where I live, and it's less than half of the price at RAO's. The servers were friendly. The greeting staff had some attitude which they should work on because honestly, for the food they serve, I'm surprised they have an attitude. Every other restaurant we ate at on the strip were wonderful (see my other reviews from Vegas for suggestions). Save your money and you can eat at least 2 great meals for the same price elsewhere. So, feel free to give this place a miss.",

Prices moderate to high . Does not look or feel very Italian. I guess it's supposed to be a New York storefront family style. See photo. My flat steak $40 a la carte. Moderate. Seems a little mall-like.  Staff not too enthusiastic . Our waiter was ok. Maybe with thanksgiving tomorrow there is a desire to go home! I've eaten all over the world and take my reviews very seriously. So, would I eat here again? I would not go out of my way or tell someone to eat here but would if convenient. 3.5*",

I first went to Rao's over 5 years ago and had one of the best meals ever....I've been back since then MANY times and I feel like it's on a slow decline.  We were a table of 8 tonight and although the service was amazing...the food was just ok.  3 people at the table ordered the eggplant parm dish (used to be one of my favorite dishes at Rao's)...it came under cooked, grilled and topped with arugula. I'm sorry but eggplant parm needs to be breaded and fried!  What's weird is that I was here maybe two months ago and the eggplant was definitely breaded and fried...lacking flavor but still at least it was cooked how it should be.  They must have changed the recipe but not for the better. My other issue is how can they possibly charge $44 for a small piece of chicken parm and spaghetti!?!?! If I'm paying $44 for chicken parm, it better be the size of my dinner plate and the best thing I've ever tasted.  I know I'm in Vegas but come on...that's just ridiculous! Unfortunately my coworkers weren't really thrilled with there dinners either...saying that \"this is just something I can make at home.\" However, I am happy to report that their meatballs are still melt in your mouth good! They are the one thing they still have going for them. I really hope next time I'm in Vegas they try some new recipes and fix the eggplant parm!",

The long and storied history of the restaurant is  depicted in the hundreds of photographs of the owner and satisfied celebrities and dignitaries  who have visited one of their locations over the decades they have been in business.  If you enjoy celebrating Christmas year round, the holly, lights, and ornaments strewn across the bar and ceiling will have you humming Jingle Bells.    We really enjoyed the lasagna and penne vodka.  The bolognese and pink sauces made the dishes exceptional.  The crusty, yet soft in the middle Italian  bread, was fresh and tasty.   You won't leave the place hungry.  The portions are generous.      Bravo Rao's !!",

    "text": "Living in Philly, I've never felt robbed of a proper Italian meal, thanks to the bevy of South Philly offerings and all that is Marc Vetri's pastas. But when I'm told I'm unable to gain admittance to one of NYC's stalwart Italian restaurants, I can't help but feel the need to sneak my way in. The original NYC Rao's has a 100+ year history in East Harlem and is a celebrity-laden experience that reserves tables for \"members.\" So unless you're a \"friend of a friend\" as they say, you ain't getting in.  So what recourse does a regular Joe or Jane have? Take a flight to Vegas and stop by the Rao's at Caesar's Palace! The menu is virtually the same along with an attempt to provide the same \"in the know\" experience. It's also replete with snarky, but experienced servers - a classic old school Italian touch.  Bread Service  You start off with Italian bread, which wasn't served warm, but was plenty fresh. A nice spread of red pepper ricotta and olive oil spread came in place of just your typical EVOO.  Mozzarella Carrozza [$16 / $15 Total Rewards]  The fried mozzarella was smaller than they may appear, especially if you consider that each triangle was $8. Enough for four decent bites in sum. Still, they were perfectly and crisply fried, housing undeniably fresh mozzarella within. A pat of simply sweet and slightly tangy marinara accompanied the mozzarella.  Taglioline with Peas & Ham [$30 / $29 Total Rewards]  Fresh made pasta, prosciutto cotto, sweet peas, light Parmesan cream sauce   The GF went with the taglioline pasta, which was nicely al dente and fresh. The light Parmesan cream sauce was sweeter than expected, with what seemed to be the essence of corn. The cooked prosciutto provided light heft to each bite, though I think pancetta may have been better served to counter the sweetness of the peas. Still, it helped to make each bite not overly heavy for a cream-based pasta dish.   Uncle Vincent's Lemon Chicken [$30 / $29 Total Rewards]  Charcoal broiled, bone-in chicken, Uncle Vincent's famous lemon sauce   I went with the famed lemon chicken, which featured wonderfully crisp skin and a juicy, moist bird. Keep in mind, there are plenty of bones to pick through with this dish, but hey - that's where the flavor is right? The lemon cannot be denied - sharp and bright.  Traditional Rao's Meatballs [$18 / $17 Total Rewards]  Ground veal, pork, beef, Italian bread crumbs, marinara   You'd be best served by trying their meatballs. In contrast with the fried mozzarella, these were huge. So big in fact that our party of five went with two orders, but one would have sufficed (that's with the belly of this pig in tow). Extremely moist and well-seasoned, there was also a great char developed on the exterior. Wonderful.   We were actually in Vegas to celebrate the GF's brother's 21st, so our server, Russ, brought out complimentary tiramisu (light, with great coffee essence), along with his kazoo. A nice touch.  I'm pretty sure the fuss for the Rao's in NYC is more about the exclusivity factor. Sure, the dishes are very good, but there are plenty of great Italian options in the city without having to jump through hoops. That being said, I can see why members would return. So if you're craving quality Italian while in Vegas, I would definitely give the Caesar's outpost a try.",

    "text": "Generally unamused by Restaurant Week, an excuse for infrequent diners to eat dumbed-down menus from restaurant's they'd not normally visit in the name of a charity that would be better served by direct donations, it was only long-standing New York Import Rao's at Caesars Palace that seemed willing to do something interesting with the $50.15 prix-fixe, a selection of novelties offered in addition to the restaurant's fabled fare finally providing a reason to check the space off a long-term list of places as-yet unseen.  Currently toqued by Chef Fatimah Madyun with pastry duties assigned to Laura Augsburger, Rao's Las Vegas was the second amongst three current iterations of the East Harlem classic whose 'impossible' reservations and 'owned' tables garner far more attention than the food, yet with the Southern Italian recipes of Frank Pellegino presented True to form  the menu itself is a well-culled pick em' of  plates to please any palate, the \"On-Strip\" pricing and stereotyped Eye-talian service an expected footnote probably best ignored.  Dining as a group of five, and as such able to sample widely from a tasting served in four family-style courses despite initial suggestions that the Restaurant Week option could not be 'added' to a larger scale meal, it was in a basket of fresh bread in three varieties paired to peppery tomato cream that the meal began and as much as restraint was attempted given all the upcoming carbs, any resistance proved futile as the warm trio was replenished more than once - the bites not topped with creamy spread proving more than amenable to sopping up any sauce gone astray.  Dividing the meal into appetizers, pastas, entrees, and dessert, with a bit of overlap to balance out courses two and three, it was after a short delay that round one was delivered along with glasses of wine for those choosing to imbibe, and although the well seasoned clams proved somewhat skimpy in portion given the pricetag there is little argument that Rao's signature meatballs more than justify their legendary status, the balance of meat and breadcrumbs somehow dense and dainty at the same time with a spice profile that melded well to both crushed San Marzanos as well as the special cream sauce rife with blue cheese.  Noting that the large space was perhaps 2/3 full throughout much of the stay, and that waiters appeared stretched across sections that saw them working two-tiers of the restaurant at once, there was again a sizable delay paired to empty glasses prior to pastas presented by a pair of back-servers, yet when the three piping hot plates arrived almost all sins were immediately forgiven, the imported dry bucatini prepared perfectly al dente beneath a smooth lacquer of eggs, pork, and cream while the tubes of Rigatoni were equally well textured amidst an aromatic red sauce, the housemade purses a far more mild option that may have benefitted from a bit of salt or grated Pecorino, though the bites taken with dried cranberries were admittedly quite nice.  Seeing secondi arrive in a much more expedited manner than the prior course, each dish served with an appropriate warning that plates were 'extremely hot,' it was here that the Restaurant Week special of Duck Cannelloni was presented and although the composition was perhaps a bit reminiscent of the aforementioned ravioli the utilization of confit duck proved a substantial upgrade to the milky ricotta in terms of both taste and texture, the $51 Veal Parmesan a bit overpriced despite good quality and substantial portion while the lemon chicken was moist and surprisingly restrained, the crispy charred skin proving a more than admirable foil to the citrus.  Already selecting a single cannoli as part of the prix fixe, and adding on a $32 platter with three more options to share, dessert at Rao's no doubt trends towards the classics and as good as both the dense cheesecake and crisp tube of lightly lemon cream were, neither could outmatch the block of espresso-soaked ladyfingers amidst mascarpone, let alone the peanut butter tart that no-doubt tipped its hat to Reese's while simultaneously meeting the tongue both rich and as light as a cloud.  While some purists may suggest that such 'one-off' concepts are disingenuous to the original others may consider such things to be a benefit providing the cooking is on point, particularly since most lack the political (or mob) ties required to visit the original and would likely be better served eating somewhere else in The Big Apple instead.  Setting aside high prices and service that would benefit from a few more hands-on-deck, Rao's is a worthy dinner for those seeking rustic red sauce on the Strip.",

We ordered the fritto misto to start- very salty and little flavor. I had the crab carbonara which I ate one bite of and pushed away. It lacked any flavor and the consistency was similar to glue. My husband had the chicken parmigiana which for $44 should be amazing. When his food came I asked him where the chicken was since all I saw on his plate was pasta. He said it was okay but wow Vegas is expensive but for that price for chicken it should have been large enough that you could see it on your plate. We split one meatball as well- it was fair. We each had a drink and no dessert and our bill was around $200.00 which would be happy to pay if we liked it. We both said we have had better meals at chain restaurants. My final complaint and then I will get off my soap box- seating. It is a large restaurant and there were plenty of seats open. We were seated in a room with all kids. We had an 8pm dinner reservation and it was for 2 people. I have kids and take them out for dinner too but when I'm not with my kids I would prefer to not sit and entertain other kids. We should have been seated in a room away from the families which a good hostess will do. Okay that's it- I'm done. Now on to another day in Las Vegas!",

    "text": "Ok what can i say about Rao's...WOW!!!!! this place is amazing!!! we ordered the gnocchi with meat sauce, lasagna, fusili with sasauge and cabbage, meatballs, and grilled veggies. First the gnocchi, im a gnocchi lover and ive tried gnocchi pretty much everywhere and these were up there with the best..the sauce is just spot on. The lasagna is to die for..the layers and goodness and the sauce and cheese..wow. the fusili with sausage was awesome also..full of flavor and just yummy in my mouth. All these great food for a great price..we got all the above entrees plus a salad, soup and an ice tea all for under $180..plus the portion size is well above normal. We left the restaurant with full stomachs unable to eat dessert which is unheard of for us..anyways im definitely coming back for sure.   The only thing i was gripe about is the info shows casual attire..well casual to me is just that casual..i went with jeans and nice shirt and shoes and my hat..they asked me to take off my hat at the dinner table which i dont mind doing ..but dont say its casual attire then. i say it should have a classy title than casual",

    "text": "So disappointed as this was a bachelorette dinner for my best friend and wish we would have looked at the reviews before we made the reservation. The night started by our server not being friendly at all. Once we all ordered our food the two people that ordered drinks waited quite a bit to get them. We placed our food order and the food took a little long which we did not care nor payed attention cause we get it, it Vegas we're in the casino area kitchen must be busy. Finally after almost 35 mins everyones food came out except for two girls meal. We figured it would be coming after since our server can't carry everything at once, we all started eating since we were on a time schedule and the girls waited for their meal and our server never realized they didn't have a plate until one of the girls asked how long would be on their food, and at this point his reaction itself told us that he had forgotten to put the order in, and look I get it, I myself am a bartender and him forgetting it would have been fine except there was never an explanation as to why the food took over 45 mins to come, never an apology or anything. The server never offered dessert or another round of drinks to the people that were drinking. And I get it he must have been bothered at the fact that a couple girls split dinner which means check average stays down, but not offering dessert or another drink to at least try to bring the check up or just to do it because that what your job is as a server is very frustrating. When it came time for the check things got even more frustrating because before we all arrived we specifically asked that we split checks as a big group and were told we could only split it 4 equal ways to which we all agreed to, except when he brought the bill he acted like he didn't know we were supposed to split the bill and caught an attitude when we mentioned so. The food was definitely better than the service which is why I'm giving it a 2 star. Again I am a bartender myself which is the only reason I tipped 20% but wish I could take it back and given that we were on a time schedule I had no chance to bring this issue up to a manager.",

    "text": "So disappointing! Love their sauce at home and use all the time! Firstly my server was very nice and attentive so not a reflection on her but -- upon being seated I ordered a glass of wine, then subsequently ordered the Caesar salad and meatballs which I requested be served together. That was at 6:45. Before I even received water or my wine which I'd hoped to enjoy prior to my meal, I was presented with my 'food order' at 6:47 - literally! Hello -- this is not McDonald's drive-thru people - I hadn't even had a chance to pour some olive oil onto a plate to try the bread that arrived the second I was seated! Then only when I asked to have some time, the too early food was removed. When i eventually said I was ready to eat - not even 15 mins later, the salad arrived so incredibly overdressed it wasn't possible to eat it. The meatballs were the only decent part of the meal but overall a highly disappointing experience. Won't be coming back!",

She refused to even let us get a seat in their bar for dinner...and we were nicely dressed, friendly hotel guests!   What kind of Italian restaurant closes their bar for dinner?!  Shut this place down and put a better restaurant in its place...or at least find a more friendly, accommodating hostess if Caesar's decides to let this tired, poor excuse for an Italian restaurant live on.  Update:  I'd like the thank this snooty Rao's hostess for refusing us service as we are now around the corner having an amazing dinner at Nobu (and in the bar!).  A much better dinner at Nobu, I'm sure, than had we stayed at tired Old Raos!",

The meatballs, caprese, and Penne Vodka are my absolute favs.  The Veal Parm is good, although massive.  Seafood salad has all kinds of seafood in it. They also have an extensive wine list with an onsite Sommelier.    This place also works for date night, business meetings, or just a dinner or drink solo.  The staff is top notch and friendly.  The kitchen is also partially open so you can see your meal being prepared if you are sitting at the bar.  Rao's doesn't feel like you are in Vegas but when you go to Vegas make sure you stop in for dinner ( I don't think they do lunch service anymore).",

    "text": "I have had the undeniable pleasure of dining at Rao's in Hollywood every month since it opened three years ago. I have had all my celebrations there from being named teacher of the year at my school to California Teacher of the Year. I celebrated my 60th birthday there in July and it could not have been better. A birthday I will never forget.  So, when I found out I would be going to Las Vegas I knew I had to go to Rao's. So Patrick, the manager in Hollywood snagged me a reservation for my two friends and me for last Saturday night. Knowing it was Vegas, knowing it was much larger than Hollywood, I had doubts, but knowing it was Rao's I knew it was going to be good. I had no idea!!!  Rao's you are truly the best and here is why.  We came in and i gave my name for the reservation and they responded, \"Oh! We know about you!  Patrick told us! We have been waiting, rIght this way!\"  So off to our table we go! I had requested a table that would be in a quiet place and so we were seated in one of the small side dining rooms.  Compared to Hollywood this place is gargantuan! We were seated and our server greeted us with a huge smile! As i was introducing the menu to my friends, we noticed that there was a large party of men that were very noisy. Knowing I did not want this to ruin the evening I asked to be moved and in fact... I went in search for a table in another dining room on my own. Because I am a regular in Hollywood I felt like here a regular so off I went. And who did i find... FRANKIE, the owner from NYC!!!! He called me by name gave me a hug and asked what i was doing here and then he introduced me to all his friends he was dining with.  I told him we would like to move and so he moved us to the booth right next to his table.  SO off we go! So now for the meal...  The food!!!!! INCREDIBLE! Just like I knew it would be! Cocktails amazing...just like Hollywood. The meatballs, to die for...just like Hollywood!  The stuffed clams, mouthwatering... just like Hollywood. Salad, fresh and tasty...just like Hollywood! Pastas, hot and flavorful...just like Hollywood!  And then came the desserts all four of them they chose for us!  Just wonderful...just like Hollywood! My friends were not impressed...they were blown away. They love old school Italian and of course Rao's delivered.    The staff is quintessential Rao's...friendly (very!)  incredible service and just like Hollywood, they were like family!  Frankie, checked in on us several times making sure everything was perfect!  Frankie...it was better than perfect.   Over the past three yearsI have told so many people about Rao's and when I do I feel like I am talking about my family.  When you have dined in a restaurant every month for three years, celebrated some of the most important events in your life and it is all with incredible people, great service and beautiful food you can't help but feel like family.   Frankie, thank you for incredible generosity and making my visit to Vegas everything I wanted it to be and more. Patrick, thanks for sharing your Vegas family with me but most of all my thanks goes to the phenomenal staff and chefs at Rao's in Vegas.  You made me feel like I was home.   If you want a great meal and desire to be treated like family...go to Rao's... whether it is Vegas or Hollywood or if you are lucky enough (I am still hoping!) New York City!  This is an American dining institution...one you must experience.  With Great Affection,  Michael Hayden, 2014 California Teacher of the Year",

I have no problem paying for food but when the tab is equivalent to a tasting menu at some of the best places in NY and LA and the food is pretty much sbarro level...that's just wrong. It seems as if  these guys have been living on name alone or they were having a REALLY off night.  Also, we told them we were in a rush and they didn't really change their already inattentive service. I guess they get enough business regardless where they can not care about their service and their food.  Oh and we made a reservation for 13 but only 11 of us showed up. They charged us for 13 anyway because \"that's our policy.\"  Will never ever ever go back again and highly recommend spending your money at the other 50 spots in vegas with better food or..going to in n out.   p.s.

The only thing that made it seem like we were in Las Vegas was the huge price tag at the end of the meal.  Thank goodness there are a lot of tourists to keep this place open.

Top this off with a strawberry shortcake that made me change my mind about it being served over a biscuit (We were a sponge cake/angel food cake family) and I was one happy lady.

During our entire dining experience I was thinking how we'd made a mistake by not going to the new and improved Bacchanal buffet for the same price.  Service was so-so with the waiter paying us minimal attention when we decided not to order drinks (we were offered no wine menu).    Upside was the Fritto Misto appetizer bigger than most main courses with the gigantic shrimp and calamari fried perfectly.  We ordered the lamb chops, spaghetti bolognese, lemon chicken and the eggplant Parmesan.  The eggplant was hands down awful, small poker chip sized slices breaded and deep fried to a tasteless and dry consistency.  The small amount of tomato sauce couldn't help these things.  The spaghetti was only slightly better.  Thank god the portions were small.  The best dish was the lamb chops, perfectly cooked.  The chicken was only OK.  $200 for four adults with no drinks, Olive Garden could have done better.",

I sat for 15-20 minutes after finishing the bolognese, trying to digest so I could order the Uncle Vincents Lemon Chicken.  I couldnt make room, so I gave up and ordered dessert.  The strawberry shortcake.  The whipped cream was the best Ive ever had.  The mandarin compote or whatever the orange sauce was just a grand slam.

    "text": "Rao's is, perhaps these days, more famous for their line of authentic Italian pasta sauces that were spawned from their kitchen.  And while their line of products is truly 5 star, I'm happy to say their restaurant (located in Caesar's Palace, across from the buffet) is also a culinary delight.  An offshoot of their main NYC-based location, the Rao's in Vegas is not a disappointment.  While a tad bit pricey, I think you'll find this place is worth your dollar, as the pizza is fantastic, as are the delicious salads, and of course the meatball is something that must be tried at least once in your life.  For those of you on the west coast, a drive to Vegas sure beats a flight to NY, so save yourself the trip and try the Vegas Rao's, if you'd like a little taste of that authentic NYC Italian fare.    Pro-tip:  Order the meatball with a marinara-based pasta dish.  Combine the two for a giant meal that will feed a couple people for a reasonable price!",

After a fabulous dinner last night at Bradley Ogden, Raos was the most horrible meal I've had in a long time. The veal Parmesan was so tough and salty I could barely eat it. Needless to say, my husband doesn't get to pick restaurants any more. He's going to have to make it up to me tomorrow for our last dinner in Vegas this trip.",

Pasta was cooked how it should be nice and Aldente. The meatballs were great!! the Sauce was good not like Rao's in NY though but I am sure that has to do with the water and stuff.  Large portions make the price worth it.  Like I said do not waste your time with other italian places in Vegas just come here.",

Great balance of modern meets rustic classic dishes.  Pretty patio area not stuffy or pompous.  Cant remember for sure but Krista was the name in my head that took exceptional care of us.",

Still tasted good.  We had the Margherita pizza and the sausage and ricotta - big surprise - a little pricey for what you get - prices for the pizza are around $14- $17 each   I loved the crust !  the sausage - mixed feeling - ok taste but for a \"personal pizza\" i say go thinner slices and more of them  - just a personal preference - a lil oregano on the pizza  - i think either add some roasted garlic or  maybe some sauted onions - just felt something was missing.  Service a little on the slow side - but overall, it's worth another visit - since i'm staying at Caesar's about 10 days this month - i suspect i'll make another visit to  Rao's",

    "text": "A taste of the old country; yep, New York City circa 1890.  The ultimate expression of what many have come to know as Italian or rather I-talian (emphasis on the I and meaning no disrespect) food in the US.  It's origins in Naples, but long since corrupted for American taste and bounty.  The Italian spirit and passion for sharing good food lives on.  Rao's is a fun place to mangia!  Example one, ginormous meatballs the size of your fist.  Flavorful, Perfectly cooked, tender, balls bathed in a hearty red sauce.  A great blend of fatty beef, pork, and lean veal the right amount of breadcrumb filler.  Example two, spaghetti alla Bolognese, a pile of noodles hidden under a thick meaty, flavor charged sauce.  Classic starters.  Baked clams, rich with butter and crisp breadcrumbs, dried herbs and a kiss of lemon; the fritto misto (calamari, shrimp, cod, and zucchini) a slightly crisp, slightly oily, aggressively seasoned; the sauteed mussels, sweet and tender sauteed in butter then quickly steamed in white wine and garlic.  No complaints.  Classic mains.  Outstanding veal chop served smothered with Rao's classic sauce of mildly spicy, sweet cherry peppers.  Subtle flavor of tender veal along side the clean, pepper flavor and zesty tomato sauce.  It heightens the sweetness of the veal.  Win!  Veal not your thing?   The same sauce tops a tender grilled shell steak (Steak Pizzaiola) and a thick, juicy, double cut pork chop.  The Ossobuco, delicious.  Well braised, tender without being stringy.  A good portion of bone marrow a nice touch.  Finally \"Uncle Vincent's Lemon Chicken; charbroiled marinated in a lemon olive oil mixture and finished in the same.  Tart, sweet, bitter, classic.  Portions are large.    Very good wine list focusing on Italy.  Typical high Vegas resort pricing.  Service is very friendly and efficient.  Exactly what you would expect from an I-talian restaurant from NYC.  Well done.",

I came with a group of 6 and was hoping for some old school Italian in the benchmark Caesar's property, and I was left with an expensive Italian dish that was simply well-prepared dishes with no umph.  Not much went into each dish and made it memorable.  We tried a bunch of options including the veal parmesan, chicken parmesan, seafood pasta, ravioli pouches, simple angel hair, and some meatballs.  Raviolis were interesting, filled with fruit, but seemed more of an appetizer.  Their notorious meatballs were great and very big, but again an appetizer which isn't supposed to be the highlight of the meal in my opinion.  The rest of the pasta dishes were fine but not spectacular which I would expect when paying $40+ per dish.  Wine menu and service were great but I still felt unimpressed as I walked out after the meal.  I was full and ate quality Italian, but at a place like that I expected to be transported to New York and I didn't feel that way after paying the bill.",

My boyfriend and I shared the rigatoni and the chicken scarpariello which was so tender and tasty. The wine specialist also recommended an excellent wine - I wish I could remember what it was... Will go to RAO's again!",

Our food was brought out pretty quickly and it all tasted great. Everybody loved their plates! Prices are a little high, but it's the average of what you'll find at any restaurant on the strip. Would definitely go back!",

That aside  Seafood salad is incredible!, Next Lemon Chicken VERY GOOD the sauce is like pure lemon vinegar and really addicting and makes up for the chicken being slightly dry. I can make way better chicken on mesquite wood in my backyard. But their lemon \"sauce\" is great. Seafood salad you can order HALF ORDER even if the waiter or waitress tries to JAM you for the full portion. I have done it 3x and both the 2nd and 3rd time they tried to tell me \"i have worked her XXXX years and we have never made half of one\" AGAIN BS! ALSO half of one is great portion!  Definitely great 2 items. The rest of the menu is a major reamer so I will not even mess with it.",

    "text": "I'd love to say that this was a great, authentic Italian pasta dinner, however, it was far from it. I've been lucky to have wonderful homemade pasta at restaurants near my home in the San Francisco Bay Area my entire life; and I'm fairly well versed on the cost of doing business in an upmarket arena, and I was shocked at both the quality of the pasta dishes my family ordered, and the price on them.  Our family ordered: Taglialini w/peas and ham, Ravioli, plain Taglialini w/butter (split between my 7yr old and 4yr old), and the special of the day (Parpadelle w/shrimp). The Taglialini w/butter was a whopping $26 for 3/4c. of boiled noodles tossed with butter, the Taglialini w/peas and ham $30 for an appetizer serving (1/2c. noodles with an equal amount of frozen peas and common ham), same price for my husband's ravioli (roughly 6-7 ravioli in red sauce), and the kicker was $39 for a bowl of under-seasoned Parpadelle w/5 medium shrimp (my 10yr old daughter's main course).  What should have been pasta with beautiful texture, signs of being hand-cut, and stuffed pasta that resembled something more than a frozen product, was just at best \"Olive Garden\" American food being passed off as authentic Italian. With such a let down on our last night in Las Vegas, I was incredibly grateful that we had an incredible service and meal experience at Gordon Ramsay's Steak the evening before.",

    "text": "I'm originally from NYC, and getting real deal Sicilian American food anywhere in the West is nearly impossible.  Thank goodness for Rao's.  As I am no rock star, I have not been fortunate enough to get into the original, but Rao's in Las Vegas is itself amazing.  Large, loud, lots of ambiance, and the staff is top notch.  Go there to eat a slow, lengthy, relaxing meal, talk, drink wine, and share a lot of courses and dishes, for goodness sake.  We skipped salads this time, but Baked clams are a must and are served exactly the way I remember them growing up in Brooklyn - plump, delicious, in a wonderful broth just made for dipping bread - if you haven't already finished the huge bread assortment with Rao's EVOO and balsamic. Remember, you need to pace yourself!  All of the pastas are awesome and just right for two people as a second course.  We had the spaghetti bolognese, very old school, and there was so much meat in the gravy, oh my, and you know by the depth of flavor that this cooked all day long to get it so sumptuous.  Still with plenty of room for our entrees, we passed on our usual choices - the monster veal parmesan chop that spills over the large plate on which it is served, my favorite shrimp fra diavolo, and even Rao's signature meat balls.  I wish we could have had them all!  Instead, we shared the crispy eggplant parmesan and the melt in your mouth veal short ribs, served with incredible polenta, and split a side order of spinach.  All to die for.    Stuffed, we still found room to share a cannoli, and sipped on expressos and sambucas to finish a PERFECT meal.  It's pricey, but hey, what what great things aren't.  Rao's is a must stop every time we come to Vegas.  No, I take that back.  We come to Vegas just to go to Rao's.  Maybe some day we will know someone who can get us into the original up in Harlem.",

When my wife asked for a gluten free menu, our waiter said they don't have one.  He said he could point out the items that were gluten free.  He said this soup and the salad without crutons, but none of the pastas.   Really, I could have figured that out ... salad without crutons was glueten free - duh.  We asked why they advertise they have glueten free options.  He said he had to go ask the chef.  We didn't even both to wait for an answer and left.   The employees were not that friendly either.

The noodles were mushy with no bite at all, the sauce was extremely salty. Good abundance of meat, though.  Wine selection is underwhelming in the $50-75 per bottle range--don't expect anything in bottles for less than that. The roasted beet/goat cheese salad was good, but plan to share.

I am lucky enough to have been a number of times to Rao's New York, and what people don't realize is that what makes it great is not just the food, but the warmth with which you are treated from Frank Sr. and his crew. You feel like you are family in his home. And he is quite a singer, and treats his customers to that as well.  Well, I am not sure if Frank Jr. can sing, but he emits the same warmth as his dad. What a class act! And the staff was great. \"Buffalo Mike\" served me at the bar, and couldn't have been better. And the food was just as good as in NY.

I expected much more of a family type atmosphere, and I've felt more valued and welcome at Olive Garden. Recommendations were brief, with no explanation or passion into the suggestions. The waiter took the orders in a clockwise manner around the table, and did not take the ladies first, which I find inappropriate for a nice meal.   For as in a hurry as he was to take the orders, there was a lot of snappiness in the service. I have no problem with a nice slow paced meal, but this was not that. We waited an extraordinary amount of time to receive our check, too. If I remember correctly, we got stuck with a 20% auto-tip too. I don't mind auto-tip for parties over 6, but let's not assume 20%, okay?  The food was good, but not great. My veal was not particularly tender, which seems like would be the signature of veal. I paid the same amount for a lamb dish at Circo days later and they weren't even in the same league.  I had high hopes after seeing and hearing so much about Rao's, but I left very disappointed and I wouldn't recommend Rao's to you. I didn't expect it to be as good as the famous New York original (I've never been there), but a reasonable facsimile would have been nice.",
