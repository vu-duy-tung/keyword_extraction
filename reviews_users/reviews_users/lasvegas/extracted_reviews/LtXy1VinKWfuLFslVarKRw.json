    "text": "Fatburger provides a solid quick-service style burger open 24 hours on the Strip right across the street from the Monte Carlo.   When I went there you could choose from small through XXXL for the burger size. I heard from a friend that their used to be only 3 sizes. I think that kind of simplicity would have be nice since I was quite baffled about which size to order. The burgers are all cooked to order which is nice but may cause a little bit of a wait. Cheese, chili, bacon, and egg are all chargable upgrades for the burger while other condiments are available for no additional charge.   I was talked into the medium size burger. I added cheese, bacon, and a fried egg. It was too big. I got to the awkward point in my meal where I was satisfied to be done eating but only had a little bit of burger to go. I decided to avoid feeling the gut bomb and just tossed it. Along with my burger I ordered the skinny fries which turned out were not really all that skinny. I mean, they were pretty much standard size fries. I think I would have been better off if I topped them with chili or ordered the fat fries or onion rings instead. Lesson learned.  All in all, it is a decent option for late night eats. Especially if you want to avoid the more notorious fast food burgers, and of course, you have at least $10 to burn on a quick bite.",

Had a laugh w/the cashier, the lady calling out the orders wouldn't let me have my food unless  I yelled my order out or yelled where I was from, lol.  Lucky I had all my friends w/me to give a shout out to OC, represent!  Customers made the wait fun!   The wait's kinda long, but like I said the staff and customers make it fun.

I remember ordering and the cashier suggesting I go all the way after I mentioned that I didn't want relish on my burger.  Thank you, Mr. Cashier!  The flavors on this \"fast-food\" burger go together like crazy!  The burgers are grilled to order and all of the toppings are fresh - probably because nothing gets a chance to sit around here.  The joint is jumping, we could barely find seats!  But back to the burger.  Just so fresh....and tasty......and not fast-foody, unsure of the meat species at all!  Fatburger is definitely all beef all the time.  And PLEASE don't get me started on the skinny chili cheese fries.  OMGeee!!!  I'm about to go on record as saying they were the best I've ever had...  At least definitely in recent memory.  Deliciously tart lemonade too.  Mmmm!!!  Dernit, now I've gotta make my way down to the one on South Beach.  Excuse me for a moment...",

It was almost $5 for a small burger that was the size of a microwavable burger you would get at AMPM. I was soooo disappointed when my guy friends ordered and ate the entire thing in about 3 bites. I had ordered the medium sized meal for a little over $10 and that included a burger twice the size as the small (yet about the same size of a regular in and out burger), steak fries and a medium drink. This was by far the most expensive fast food that I have ever purchased and tasted like I could get it at my neighbor's BBQ next week. They did not have any special sauces so I was bewildered to see how this was considered a top place to go to late at night. Particularly because there is a McDonald's next door and dollar menu was looking mighty fine after this disheartening meal. If you wanna save some money as well as have a good meal, I'd suggest you walk 10 feet away to the Mcdonald's next door and have a feast.",

Roaming around the strip drunk in the am anything sounds/taste delicious right?! WRONG!!!!   By the time it was 6am in Vegas i was seriously craving for a mchicken across the street after EDC but little did my idiotic brain knew that mcd was serving breakfast :(( booo! so we opted to go to fatburger since we were all craving for \"burgers\" We waited in line looking at their menu and decided to go w/ their medium burger.   The employee who took my order not only was falling asleeep on me, she asked me for my order 3x's and not only was she confused I WAS CONFUSED!! i was not frustrated at all although i was drunk ordering my food, i felt bad cause she told me she was working a long shift and she couldn't wait to go home...   When i got my order i asked for ketchup and she told me they didn't have any?! what the f****** what kind of burger joint doesn't have any ketchup?! s0o i asked another employee and he actually gave me some.. lol   When we got back into our hotel i opened my burger with excitement ready to devour that sh*t and the burger was cold and soft... disgusting and it tasted to PLAIN. i opened my bun and there WAS NO KETCHUP OR ANYTHING..... Was i suppose to order a burger w/ ketchup?! i thought it usually comes w/ condiments w/o being said?!   You don't go to mcd and burger king ordering a burger and say \"Oh don't foget the ketchup, pickles, mustard, and onions\" -___-",

    "text": "We stopped by here after going to the after hours club, Empire. It was around 4:00am-5:00am, we were drunk and hungry so we ate here. Like what everyone else said, is this place ever clean? My friends and I came back here three times during the week (usually in the late night, early morning) and it was always dirty. They have tons of ingredients on the burger: mustard, relish, onions, pickles, tomato, lettuce, mayo, and cheese, bacon, egg, chili (which cost extra). Ate at this place in Vegas and SoCal and came to realize, I'm not a huge fan of it and only eat it due to its convenience and because we didn't know where else to eat in Vegas during that time. Onion rings and steak fries were mediocre. Could barely finish a king burger to myself, fat burger was pretty easy to kill by myself. Also, at the bottom of your receipt, they usually offer free onion rings for your next burger purchase...keep in mind, the onion rings aren't that great.",

Nothing too special about it, although they do offer ginormous portions, and give you an option to add a fried egg.  I was not very fond of the wedge fries, got to sample the shoe strings and onion rings, both which taste better. The location is great if you are staying around the strip, about a 5 min walk from planet hollywood.",

It was pretty darn good, the first thing i noticed about a fat burger thats different than a lot of the burgers that i've had is that a lot of the focus on flavor actually goes into the meat.

We stumbled in here as the sun was rising for a nice burger and a breakfast sandwich, and I have never been so disappointed by a place in my life.  The food took forever, with about only 3-4 people ahead of us.  Also while waiting we witnessed a fight between two guys waiting in line, rolling on the ground with light slapping back and forth.  Then I made the mistake of going to the bathroom.  I have never, ever seen a bathroom as bad as this one.  The Caution Wet Floor sign was up, implying that they mopped, but that bathroom has not seen a mop or cleaning materials in a long time and smelled horrible.  Our food eventually came out and was really mediocre, between all of us there, most said they wished we went to McDonalds instead and the rest said they wished they had not ordered anything at all.  I would never go back.",

When I saw those fries after I ordered them I was very disappointed it was like they took American cheese and put it on top and let it melt. I was very confused on how you mess up cheese fries it's very easy. Anyways the burger was big but tasted like nothing if that makes any sense. The bun was like dry and not soft it was gross I needed a lot of coke to wash it down with. After I eat it my stomach wasn't happy for a while. This place is over priced and gross.

This particular Fatburger did not make a great first impression on me. I did enjoy the casual atmosphere and the outdoor dining, albeit really loud. At places like these, I like to order my burger with basic toppings like lettuce and tomato and no sauces or cheese so I can see how the burger itself tastes. Mine was overcooked, the edges fell off from being poorly made, and it was too salty. If you're here with a larger group, remember what you ordered. When the food comes out, the server will have all the burgers on one tray and all the sides on another, as opposed to serving each person what they ordered individually. Sodas at $3.50 and bottled water at $4 was a bit pricey.   There's a much longer line for a burger at Shake Shack across the street, and maybe that's a tell.",

Walking the strip and seeing fat burger was not busy ( 1am sat night ) decided to try this place out. Sitting outside in the patio area, watching drunk people pass by the waitress comes and asks \"any drinks?\" Umm yes just water for now, since I haven't looked at the menu yet. (Please note, all employees that work here do not wear name tags...ODD)  Waitress comes back again and asks for my order, in which i tell her and brings me another water. Noticing others around me, there was a couple who arrived after me and got their food already. ( Already waiting 20 mins) So i figured my food should be arriving soon then. 40 mins later, food STILL hasn't shown up, now I'm furious. I flag down the waitress and ask her where the food is at and she leaves for another 5 mins, comes back and tells me something happened with my ticket order and the kitchen doesn't have it and she can't find it.....Really?? She then says \" Oh I must of thrown it away, what's your order again??\" uhh...So i asked for the manager on duty right away and told him what happened. He apologizes and gives me free drinks and a meal. Pshhh waiting an hour for a hamburger....ya no thanks...  Please avoid this place at all costs!",

    "text": "This is convenient because it's on the strip and not buried in the depths of a hotel. There's ample indoor and outdoor seating.   It's a typical Fatburger which means juicy burgers, and the fat fries (nice steak cut fries) are a must. This location is a bit pricey; now this just could be that I haven't been to a Fatburger since I moved away from LA, or their prices are just higher since it's on the strip. I'd go with the latter.  The wait is kinda ridiculous here. There was no one in front of me, and all I ordered was a cheeseburger and fries, and I waited like 30 minutes for my to-go order. Also, my burger came to me way before my fries, even though I was taking it to go, so I was pretty concerned my food was going to get cold. It's weird because loads of others got their fries before me, and I had to ask about my fries after my burger came, so I think they just kinda forgot part of my order.  Ultimately, this was an ok meal. I was in town because my boyfriend was at a convention, so I just wanted to grab something quick and take it back to the room since I was solo at the time. I just really wanted some fat fries though.  In Vegas, there's so many places that are better than this, and probably quicker (and maybe cheaper) that I'd prefer to spend my money elsewhere.   This location is convenient enough to the Tropicana Hotel and MGM though if you need a snack.",

    "text": "Big burgers, big prices, fits right into this extravagant city.  I went for the self-seating outdoor bar, famished after a long night.  A quick check of the reviews said that largest size - XXXL - was almost unfinishable due to the size, so I ordered the XXL.  With no bun (paleo!).  And a fried egg.  And bacon.  Because it was technically breakfast.    There is a bit of a wait, but it was bearable - large burgers grilled to order take a bit of time.  What came out was two huge patties, with the cheese, bacon and egg layered on top, resting on some greens, onions and tomatoes on the side.  Although it looked dry, it was juicy and flavorful.  The egg was cooked to over-hard, which was fine.  The bacon was just okay.  I knife and forked it easily (much easier to eat than In-N-Out's Protein style order).  I finished it all, but it was a lot of food - a very fat burger indeed.  The outdoor seating is enjoyable, more so for the view of the tvs by the bar, and the comely staff.  The people watching is a bit muted, from our time there.  Service is attentive.  If I wanted a gut-bomb of a breakfast/lunch, this could be a place I'd go back too.",

The choice was McDonald's or Fat Burger,  My wife and I decided to try this place more so because McDonald's was crowded and we also wanted to sit down and enjoy a drink or two :)  We walked in bar area and were told by one of the guys cleaning the tables that we could sit at any of the table and order our food and drink there.  Well we waited and waited and we waited a bit more... The lady servers kept ignoring us and a few other people sitting at the other tables... We waited around  30 minutes or more  In the end our patience ran out and we walked out... As we left two young ladies were handing out coupons to people passing by to get them to go in.... Really why... You could not take care of customers who were actually there...    The good news is we did not waste our money on this dive and found a place that served just what we wanted.. sadly no drinks... but awesome customer service... Check out my review on that place and give this dump a miss.",

WTF?!?  25 minutes to get a burger when we went at 7pm... I could get a starter and entree in that time from 90% of restaurants out there.  Despite that, the burger came out cold.

Food - 6/10 Service - 10/10 Atmosphere - 8/10 Wait Time - 8/10  Stopped in because I heard this place was decent. Ordered a 1/3# breakfast burger (burger, egg, bacon, cheddar) and they had an advertisement for free fries with a purchase of a draft beer, so naturally, I jumped on this offer. We ended up getting charged for the fries, went back up, the cashier had recognized us and his mistake, apologized and admitted he got a bit flustered with the line that was forming behind us. The fact that he straight up admitted he made a mistake, without trying to dance around the issue, really made me appreciate the service here. So he called over the manager and they were going to refund us, which I know can be a pain, so I asked if we could get onion rings instead, and the manager (without hesitation) said yes. FANTASTIC SERVICE. The onion rings were brought right over.  I'm pretty picky when it comes to breakfast burgers. I can say this wasn't the best I've ever had, but it was better than some of the worst. The meat could've used more flavor, but regardless, a good burger!  It was a tad bit expensive though. For 2 breakfast burgers, 1 beer, and fries was $40...",

After a late night of partying on the strip, my girlfriend and I, along with a buddy of mine, decided to check out FatBurger for a late night snack.  The atmosphere was really nice, its a fast food joint that looks like a diner serving up burgers made to order, pretty crafty!  Ordered their large 8oz burger with the works, cheese, fried egg and bacon with a side of fries.  I know it sounds like a lot but you live once, and you know what they say, what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas!  Burger was tasty but way too greasy, even if I were to take out the egg and bacon, by the time I got back to my hotel the bag was already soaked with grease.  It's awesome for those who want to try something new, they open 24/7 on the strip so its very convenient for those looking for a late meal.  I'd come back again if I'm hungry but definitely not something that I'd choose as a first option.",

It was practically empty inside.  I'm so happy I went here!!  I had the Small (Baby Fat) Fatburger with cheese, bacon and an egg. DELICIOUS!!  I'm drooling right now...  The skinny fries were great too.  I even made a trip to In-N-Out sometime the next day - my first time there actually.  Although it was good, I preferred Fatburger, and made more trips here instead!  The location was convenient, and the people that worked there were really nice, funny actually.  People have said that they have encountered shady customers.  However, I went there a few times between 1-4AM, and all I saw were tourists, like myself. Maybe I was just lucky.  I miss you Fat Burger!",

The waitress recommended strawberry and Miami vice, I honestly didn't like this at all. I felt as though she was rushing to take our order and didn't seem genuinely interested in giving suggestions.  Also, we asked for the bill but stayed for a few mins after it was brought to us. Right away the amount of the bill and 20% tip was placed into the bill holder.  About 20 mins after getting the bill, we gathered our stuff to leave. The waitress passed by and saw us near the exit and said \"did you ladies leave the bill?\" ... clearly we asked for it --- why wouldn't we leave it?  I might be overthinking but that was just weird since a group of females sitting at the bar got up.. left and weren't asked if they paid. Actually, our waitress never even asked if we were doing okay during our time there.",

You can get something as small as 2.5 oz. to as big as 16-24 oz. (2 or 3 of their eight ounce patties) If you have a big appetite and money to spare you won't leave here hungry. The meat itself tasted bland, though, and lacked flavor. I wanted to like it, but there was just something missing.  Even the fries were OK at best. There is something cool about them, though - you can get them in three different styles - skinny (shoestring), fat (almost steak-fry like) and in a sweet potato variety. So there's something for everyone here.  A word of warning - at this Las Vegas strip establishment, the prices are jacked up compared to regular Fatburger restaurants. It's the price you pay for eating near the action.",

    "text": "The Fries of all shapes and sizes here are on the money. I parked behind this place for like $5 or something; some sketch guy is like: \"give me five bucks, and you can leave it here all day!\" \"Is it safe back here in this rando' parking lot?\" \"Yeah, dude. Here, put this raffle ticket in your window. You'll be good all day.\" I left about $4k worth of personal items in the truck, and then stumbled into this Fatburger on the strip.   First time I've ever had it, and I could eat this every day if necessary. Not world-class food, or life changing by no means. But me and my fiance split an original burger and fries, and it was enough to get us up and down the strip for the afternoon for around $8. I suggest splitting it, because it's a lot of food - hence, Fatburger. And honestly, you're in Vegas; if you don't understand that great food is easily found everywhere, you're missing a huge part of what makes that place even bearable. Honestly, eat the Fatburger for fuel, in order to get you to some True greatness down the street.  The place seemed clean, and honestly, we had lunch there for two days. I don't mind it, but on the cheap, it can be had quick. Try a shake too, if that's your thing, because they looked great. Avoid it a little after hours though, cause it can get gamey with the drunkards and sorted riff raff.",

I would dine here again and recommend.",

I would have never payed this bill obviously but the security and bartenders bullied me into paying the entire 166 dollar bill. They threatened me to the point I had to pay the bill or I was gonna get beaten up. I feared for my own well being which is insane to me because all we wanted to do was get some food before bed. These are all facts I would never advise ANYONE to eat at this establishment",

Yes the burgers are pricey, and what puts this place over the 3 stars is the FULL bar! FULL BAR AND BURGERS! and  they are not skimpy with the pour on that liquor!   so 4 stars because it's a decent burger, it's open at and indecent time and you have a full bar in a cool outdoor atmosphere RIGHT on the strip!

The co-worker i'm with says \"We gotta go to Fat Burger\". Being from the East Coast i had never heard of it, so I decided to give it a shot. Place looks nice enough, will have to go without beer for a half hour. I get in line, look at the menu, and decide the burger is where its at. I get up front and see a sign \"Free fries with purchase of beer\". What? They serve beer here too?  Hence the 4 up to 5 stars. So the burger was fantastic, and really hits the spot at that time in the evening/morning. The fat fries were just regular steak fries, but man those burgers hit the spot.

The burgers here though just weren't that great. It was pretty expensive and didn't have much flavor and wasn't juicy at all.   In n Out is sooooooo much better and a lot cheaper...at least compared to this location. Highly suggest that people go there instead if wanting something a bit more quick.   If you do come here though they usually have a groupon so check!",

    "text": "No beating around the bushes, it's a fat burger! They're not trying to make a healthy statement with grain free buns, organic ingredients or grass fed beefs, just a really good tasting burger.   First of all, my fiends and I were staying in the central strip and so walking here made all the sense in the world. Can't comment on parking. I remembered my dad saying that this was one of their favorite burgers in Vegas. So I dragged my hungry friends for a ten minute walk just past Planet Hollywood. They kept saying let's just settle for this and that, but I said do you have this place where you're from??? Nope.  When we got there, at the entrance some guy passing out cards, gave us a BOGO drink coupon each for this place. Then we sat and waited. They don't have enough servers, and we were hungry. It was nice out, so we sat outside.   Finally a pleasant server came and took our orders and honored our fresh BOGO cards, score! Then we waited. Finally our drinks arrived, nothing special just a draft beer, but something to keep us company while yet again waiting.   Our burgers arrived, and I must say they are huge! I got a 1/3 pounder and one of my friends got the 1/2 pounder! It's not cheap, but for the size of this masterpiece I thought it was worth it. It was delicious, and filling. Didn't feel like I had to eat again for 4-6 hours later.   Overall the burgers we all agreed were excellent in taste, freshness, and ability to fill you up. The restaurant itself was kind of dirty because they didn't clear tables quick so it would blow on the ground. The wait was something not everyone would tolerate so well, but if you want a good burger and don't want to break the bank, this is a great spot for that.",

With 3 meat patties and ton of condiments and cheese in-between whats not to like about this burger(that's coming from the fat kid that's inside me). Either way it was amazing had this nice juicy burger and will fill you up especially the XXXL burger and the sweet potato fried are the real deal as well.  Only thing that bummed me out was that i finished the XXXl burger and in the back i noticed they have like a wall for people that finished that burger. I wished someone would of told me so i could of gotten on that wall and also a certificate on it. But oo well i guess =\\  Over great place, now what are you wating for go give it a try yourself.",

They were the best I've ever had. None of that seasoned salt just plain old American white salt. The tab for the cheese burger large fries and a medium drink was $20.19.

We all got a Fatburger and fries, and they had some deal going where you got your fries free if you got a draft beer. Definitely a good deal with the high prices of Vegas. The burgers were good, but in my opinion just your basic quick burger. Not the best burger I've ever had, but I'm glad I checked it out. The outdoor/patio bar is great too on a nice summer night!",

The parking was a breeze even if you do have to shoo people out of the way from crossing the driveway, which is nonstop.  Sorry, move the F out of the way, I'm coming in because I'm hungry enough to jump out and start chewing on one of you people.  We got in and there was no crowd.  I have to warn you here, FB is pricey, but we knew that already.  I just ordered for the one daughter, but my other one decided she wanted McDonald's; me too.  Woo-hoo, McDeath's is just next door!!!!  Sweet!  So got one kid situated outside at the open air seating, complete with open bar and misters.  Please, if you're a slow eater, sit away from the misters because they spray every other second and it does get annoying after a bit.  We went to the McD's next door and luckily avoided a big gang of folks who herded in.    It was very nice sitting there people-watching out on the strip.  A nice calm evening with my teenagers, watching guys hand out X-rated flyers to passers-by.    Leaving is the same hassle as coming in because I had to darn near run over folks to leave because they don't care if you've been sitting there a while waiting to LEAVE!  Fortunately, I'm from back East and have a A-card on guerrilla driving.  MOVE!  So just be prepared to be a little proactive in that department.",

One of the guys mentioned a fried egg that they on your burger, so we were determined to try it at that moment! When we finally arrived at Fatburger, we were hesitant about entering cause it looked kinda shady, but we finally built up the courage.   Their menu doesn't really offer much to choose from. The only unique option that they have is the fried egg. I had the medium burger with skinny fries. I opted out of the fried egg since it didn't seem appealing to me anymore. The burger wasn't bad, but it seemed like a poor In-N-Out imitation. The skinny fries were crispy even though we walked all the way back to our hotel room before gorging. Overall, it was decent and cheap. I'd definitely choose Fatburger over the McDonalds next door though.",

I've never had a Fatburger mostly because all of the ones I know of in the Midwest closed.   We split a L burger and fat fries. The fat fries are what most places call \"steak fries\" they were really good and freshly made. We ordered the burger the way they normally make it and add cheese. The burger was decent but nothing life changing. It was heavy on the mustard also.   It took 20 minutes to get our food, which was longer than I expected but it wasn't that big of a deal.   I've heard this place is great when you're drunk so maybe I came at the wrong time",

The burger is small, they always were.  The value just isn't there for me, For $13 I should get fries and/or a significantly bigger burger.

Cut a pie in fourths and I took the last remaining section. The bartender waited/stood in one section and didn't move out of that area for 15min (not exaggerating) except to make drinks in service bar or talk to couple near service bar or check her phone (3x), never once looking at or acknowledging other customers. Granted it gave me PLENTY of time to study the menu and decide what I wanted, AND search my phone for other options. But, I wanted a burger.  Table- So, I switched to a table top, since they looked like they were getting waited on.  Again, not many people and service was slow but at least some one showed up to take an order. Service was-take order, run, drop, run, ask if u need anything as she's almost to next table, drop check. Sigh  Food- I sat across from a sign saying \"voted best burger in Las Vegas.\" WOW, WoW, wow, the standard for burgers must be REALLY low for Las Vegas. My niece and I have made it our mission to search the DFW area for  the best burger, so I have some idea. The pattie reminded me of a bulk stack of patties I once and last time bought from Walmart. The rest of the burger, reminded me of Burger King.  Note to self- got to Burger King, faster, better!",

To promote the new FOX TV show's Bob's burger, we were a bit confused at first thinking Fatburger is now Bob's burger, but it's only temporary. This is a good place if you want to grab a burger something quick besides McDonald's. It's a bit pricier than other fast food chains, but it was just fattening good. The burgers can get larger and larger, but the average size of their burger would be a medium since a small would like a tiny burger.",

The line although long, moved rather quickly. I had a large Fatburger meal. My burger was very good and just the right size. The skinny fries were also quite good and similiar to the fries you would get at McDonald's. The prices are kind of high for fast food, but what can you expect for a place in the middle of the Vegas strip. If you are drunk and in need of late night eats, you would be well served going to Fatburger and getting the grease you need to fight tomorrow's inevitabe hangover.",

I got a mini fatburger w/ cheese, fat fries, and skinny fries (for my gf). Said bye to my new friends.....grabbed a cab (I was almost sober, so no point in walking back) and headed back.

A sign for a new Brazilian-type restaurant shown on the side of the Krave building had me hopeful, but I walked a block in the wrong direction only to find there was no such place.  Arg.  But, it's good to know that if I'm ever looking for boys dressed like girls, Krave is the place to find them...  I digress.  I kept on walking and walking, and ended up at Fatburger.  It was good but the service was crazy slow.  I ate my Kingburger and fries, slurped down my shake, and steeled myself for another long walk back down the strip.",

I was missing out big time.  I ordered a turkey cheeseburger because I'm not a fan of red meat. But if no one told me it was turkey, I'd swear I was eating ground beef. It was super juicy and the burger had all the grease residuals from the stove. I got mine sans mustard, pickles, and relish because those are not my friends. Still with all the other toppings (lettuce, tomato, mayo, raw onions) my burger was pretty tall. It also came in a toasted wheat bun. Did I mention, the burger was as big as my face?  Fatburger also offers skinny fries and fat fries. You can get them with cheese or chili cheese. Everything on the menu looks super good but the burger was enough to fill me up. In regards to the price (not cheap), Fatburger is also better than Bistro Burger.",

You hear the workers yelling out orders, it is a small diner-like atmosphere, and the burgers just taste good.

It does have a somewhat fun atmosphere if you're into that workers being loud, but that's not my type of crowd.   We got a XXXL Burger, fat fries and a Chili Cup and brought it back to the hotel. The burger was huge, but it was over $9. It was difficult to pick up so we basically just took it apart. My friend ate most of it, but from what I had it was a decent burger -- better than the typical fast food restaurants available to new yorkers at least. I have yet to try In-N-Out, so I can only compare it to places like McDonald's or Burger King. The chili was really salty, but we ate it with the fries. The fries were crispy and seasoned well.   The food is better than your average fast food restaurant, i.e. Wendy's, McDonald's, etc but it's not as clean, so I'm not comfortable eating there and the clientele's too rowdy at night, but I'll gladly get it to go.",

    "text": "OK,  So you know how you go to a fast food joint and the burgers on the menu behind the counter are shown all nice and big and juicy, but when you order it, it turns out to be an overcooked, undersized, nothing remotely close to a sandwich even worthy of being called a reasonable facsimile thereof? Well, Fattburger has mastered this process...inversely. The picture on the menu did not even begin to do justice to the mammoth, gigantic, huge, swollen, bloated mass of beef served greasily to me between the two unfortunate slices of bun forced to bear the weight of this thing. To make matters worse (or better, depending on one's POV), I had an additional patty, avocado and bacon added to the behemoth.   The ride back to the hotel was arduous. The aroma of the fried beast filled the car, beckoning to my hunger to stagger at the next red light and take a large bite from this beefy buffet. Wisdom prevailed, however, as I knew that once the beast was unleashed, it would go neither quietly nor cleanly back into its now saturated paper encasing. Must hurry.  Barely, but successfully, I transported the package to my room, bag intact, where it was stripped down to its full, naked, delicious elegance. At last, we are alone, you and I. Come.   With all my hunger, I was still not able to finish. \"Fatt\" does NOT accurately describe the girth of this burger. Try as I might, a happy plate (bag rather) was not to be. Stomach capacity exceeded. Digestion activated. Food coma eminent. Not to worry. With a refrigerator and microwave readily available, we shall meet again very soon. Abdominal pain setting in. Oh Lord, please let me make it thru the night.   If you find yourself in Vegas, be sure to treat yourself to a Fattburger. I warn you, though. Do not underestimate this sandwich, for it is Fatter than its Fatt namesake. Also, I don't recommend more than one within a six month period. Your heart and grandkids will thank you.   \"S\"",

After a night out at the clubs, or working dealing with all of the myriad people out at night, sometimes one has to tear into something as substantial as a XXL to make it all worthwhile.    The burgers are good and made to order, the shakes are decent (I like the Maui banana the best), and nothing tops off a giant meal like fat fries (eat them quickly as they are best while hot).",

The only thing I can say is that the burgers are freaking slamming, especially after having some beer flavored drinks.   The burgers range all the way from medium to XXXL and I went with a medium every single time (make fun of me if you want). If you are feeling tough, go ahead and get the XXXL. My buddy did it and almost died on the spot from cholesterol overload...but he did say it was freaking awesome. Overall it's a slam dunk for fast food and maybe the sloppiest/greatest burger I've had....while in Vegas. BOoM!",

    "text": "I went to Vegas hell-bent on trying different burger places.  I got to the strip at about 2am and FatBurger was right there so I had to try it.  I had found memories of it from 8-years ago so I had to go and re-live it again.  First Impressions:  I have to say the Late night service kind blows. Took 15 mins to get my order. Food came out in about 5 though. I guess this is how I remembered it.  The cashier took a long time doodling with the register, guest who had already been helped were coming back and trying to add things on or make changes.  It was a cluster F.  It took me 20 mins to get 2-small burger meals with drinks.  That irritated me but I was hungry.  On Second Look:  In my humble opinion, a good burger isn't defined by its gimmick or cult following - but rather it's patty.  This burger's patty was delicious and it complimented the rest of the crap on there.  The mayo and juices were flowing and got me to forget about the sub-par service I got while waiting for it.  I think it's whack that you have to pay extra for cheese, but hey this is America.    The burger is better than the service.  Go there if you're hungry and want to grub out, but don't plan a trip around it.  They also have an outside bar now which is kind of lame.",

A cheap place to eat, but definitely unhealthy for ya. I ordered a large burger combo with egg and the sandwich gave me mixed feelings. The burger was good, but it was a bit too oily for me. The oild drenched the wrapping paper and onto the table and slowly made it to the edge of the table to drip on my pant. The egg was not my expectation. It could be my fault, I was expecting sunny side-up, but it was not. I guess I wanted the egg yolk to drip all over the place but that didn't happen.  If there was a Fatburger where I live, I would definitely give it another try. Probably the next time I go to Vegas, I'll stop by for a visit.",

The husband and I went last week to this one on the strip, I always get the medium burger with cheese, fat fries and a soda.  It does take a few minutes to get your food since it is cooked to order.  The staff here are always friendly and the food is always good.  It is super unhealthy, but damn, it's a good burger.  They also have really tasty onion rings which the husband always gets with his burger.  The restaurant is not the cleanest, as it is right on the strip and I think does a fair amount of business, but if you can get over that it's fine.  I used to be a huge In N Out fan, but they have gone down hill in the last few years and are more like a cheap cardboard burger with fries that are lacking.  Fatburger blows In n Out away!    Between the burger and fries it's usually too much food for me, but I don't care, it's worth it.  You will pay more than $4-$5 for your meal, but you get what you pay for.",

My Fat Burger didn't look too fat, but it's all an illusion; it's actually quite a beast. I wasn't sure if I would be able to walk back to my conference when I was done.   Fatburger is a cheap eat, nicely situated on this South part of the strip. I'm glad to have found it. The interior feels vintage and jukebox is pretty rockin'.

Right when we walked in, some customers were having some kind of staring contest or mad dawging contest, and a fight was about to break out! One guy was saying \"Hey dude! Stop looking at me!\" and the other guy just ran up to him, mad dawged him up close and personal, and then said they would take it outside. Once they walked outside, tons of people rushed out...and even the Fatburger WORKERS! Oh my goodness!?!? What happened to customer service? What happened to the security? Well, even the security guard didn't care...he wanted to see it too!   At any rate, I don't think anything happened. The workers all came back in, and our late night dinner ensued..  My bf and I split a cheeseburger meal. The fries were nice and hot, and tasted ok. The burger was pretty good, as others have told me. Yes, I agree with others that it is better than In-and-Out's old-fashioned take on burgers.   The place was dirty too! People just leave their trash everywhere, and workers don't clean the areas regularly. You would think that if this restaurant is in some sort of tourist area like the Strip, they would have better service and a more tourist-catered atmosphere. They don't....and it sucks...  If you are craving for that Fatburger, I recommend going somewhere else (and not this stinky, ghetto place)!  I was gonna give this place 1 star, but the burger convinced me to be a bit more generous, so I gave it another..",

The atmosphere/vibe/decor: We sat outside, it was really nice and fun to watch all the people walking the strip. It was clean, casual, and I liked that we were shaded by an umbrella because that sun can get hot!  The Food: I was really surprised to see that they had Gluten Free buns! That was awesome, and they were delicious so that's always a plus. Their burgers range from normal to gigantic size and it's all really delicious and tastes fresh. The French fries were crispy and the beer was cold and delicious!  The Service: The girl serving us was really friendly and personable, she answered all of our questions and was very accommodating which we appreciated. Though, at the end of our meal as we were paying the bill, it was about $43 and we paid with a $50... she grabbed the bill & said, \"I'll be right back with your change\" and we waited for 12 minutes as we finished our drinks then waited another 5 minutes. She never came back and avoided us at all costs until we finally gave up and started to leave. She waved at us and said, \"thanks guys! Have a good one!\" Of course we were going to tip her, but the fact that she just took the money and never came back is really, wrong. That was really sort of frustrating.  Overall: the food was great, the service was good but sort of an odd experience. Next time, I'll pay with my card I guess...",

There was literally nothing special about our food.  Did someone order \"extra ordinary for two\"? That is what we got.  The fries were pretty good, however, everything else was average!

    "text": "Me:  \"Fatburger?  Never heard of them!\" One of my friends suggested, \"I hear they're pretty good.\" We decided to try it.  Both my friends and I agreed.  This might be a good burger if you're drunk, but it was pretty bad while sober.  While my friends ordered their own combinations I went with the medium Fatburger deal omitting cheese and onions on my burger and choosing the fat fries over the skinny fries.  Although this place looks and operates very much like a fast food place it is not.  The burgers are cooked to order so definitely expect a wait for your food order to be called.  If you order a soft drink it's self serve.  That part I liked about Fatburger because I can control how little ice and how much soft drink actually goes into the cup.  However, back to the burger.  My number was called and a worker delivered the burger tray to me.  The first thing I noticed was how small the burger (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/LtXy1VinKWfuLFslVarKRw?select=2v29rPxqQNAWVXQlLTyqPQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/LtXy...</a>) was compared to how large the portion of steak fries were.  I love thick fries which is why I selected the Fat Fries over the skinny ones.  These were a huge disappointment even though they were nice and meaty and fried to a perfect golden yellow color.  The fault was in the oil which tasted old, and because of that the fries didn't taste fresh.  You'd be surprised how big a difference there is just by changing the oil in a fryer.  The burger was not good either.  The burger patty was so overcooked no moisture existed within the meat.  I might have been happy had there even been a glistening of grease within, but nope, chewing cardboard is probably the best comparison.  The shredded lettuce while crisp had the odd taste of being stored in a refrigeration unit badly in need of a box of baking soda.  I don't mind that they use pickle relish instead of pickle slices but even that tasted old.  It's kind of like when you go to Costco and stock up on too much of something and store it until the taste begins to waver.  The pickle relish did not have a fresh snappy taste to it.  The only ingredients which tasted fresh were the tomato slice, the bun and the mustard.  At the least the service was good and the workers are friendly.  I can honestly say I won't be back at a Fatburger restaurant anytime in the foreseeable future.",

    "text": "I love the decor of the Fat Burger with its counter seating and old timey feel. The prob is that a meal is just about $10 for a burger, fries, and drink. That's outrageous for fast food in my opinion.   They are currently running an interesting promotion where you buy a meal, and they give you a second burger for free. I guess if you have a hungry friend along who can cope with sharing your fries and drinking water, this would be a great cheap date place! ;-)  Best thing I ate here were the fries, Picked the skinny ones, as opposed to the steak fries. Very crispy outer shell and only slightly salty. A very clean natural flavor.   The burger patty was tasteless as seems to be the M.O. for fast food joints these days with their overcooked meat. Nothing at all special about the burger.  Overall, I'd rate In N Out higher than the Fat Burger, since there is no equal to In N Out's Animal Style topping combo.",

We found a table outside and waited for a while..like 15 minutes before someone even came over and acknowleged us. We were getting pretty irritated when finally a guy comes up and asks if we'd been helped.  After we told him no, he said ok and walked off...within like 2 minutes he was back to take our order.   There were 3 of us, and we all ordered burgers with fries and a water. I got the 1/2 lb fatburger with the skinny fries. It came out after a brief period and I devoured it. I hadn't eaten since lunch, and it was delicious to me. Looking back, it was probably just average, but delish at the time. It was juicy though, and had great toppings. The fries were good too.   I thought this place was ok. I'd probably come back- if I knew we wouldn't have to wait so long to order. Prices weren't too bad",

    "text": "Fatburger is the African-American version of Johnny Rocket's.  In order to create a Fatburger, you take the Johnny Rocket's old school diner feel and replace the Elvis, Roy Orbison, and Jerry Lee Lewis with the Aretha Franklin, Al Green, and the Jackson 5. The music here has me \"all shook up,\" but it has my, \"r-e-s-p-e-c-t.\" I love it.  Fatburger also takes the complicated Johnny Rocket's menu, eliminates 75 percent of it, and makes you focus on how you want your burger and what kind of fries you want. Ordering is like, \"A-B-C, easy as 1-2-3.\"  You first pick the size of your burger. By size, it means in terms of patty size (2.5, 5.3, 8, 16, and 24 ounces). I am not sure who can eat a 2 pound burger, but until I weigh 400 pounds or I am high on government grade grass, I'll stick to the 5.3 ounce patty. Plus, there's only so much meat I can fit in my mouth.  You then pick the toppings. The burgers come loaded with fresh lettuce, onions, tomatoes, and pickles (unless you say otherwise), but you get to add to your \"Fatburger\" experience with four extra toppings: cheese, bacon, chili, and/or an egg. Personally, I always roll with cheese and bacon. But under the influence of Las Vegas, I have added chili and an egg and it while it was different, it was still delicious. Yum. Burp. Fart.  If you want fries, you get two options: skinny fries or fat fries. The former is thin and crispy, and the latter are more like steak fries. Honestly, they are both really good. This is like having to choose between Betty and Veronica. And just like Archie, I can't truly commit to either option.   So I pick one or the other on each visit, but never both at the same time. You have to keep your options open and never let them know you are savoring both. Now that's \"True playa\" status, right there. Ya feel me?  Also, the milk shakes shakes are wonderful. You have try one at least once. They have five different flavors: chocolate, vanilla, strawberry, Maui-Banana, and Oreo Cookies & Cream. You can't go wrong with either, but I suggest the vanilla, strawberry, and cookies & cream options. They are just so thick and creamy. That's what she said.  In addition to all of this, the service is stellar. But since it's set up is not a sit down restaurant, you don't need to tip. I guess Fatburger eliminated the tipping from Johnny Rocket's too. So you are left with great burgers, at a good price, in a cool environment.  Needles to say, I'm a fan of the African-American Johnny Rockets: Fatburger.",

Its hard to say without a doubt best burger ever with the amount of burgers Ive eatn, but when someone asks me it will always be mentioned.  Atmosphere is cool, fries are great, I even thought the pop was extra tasteful.  They serve booze but I dont like drinkn when Im eatn for those who do that.

It gets better as you eat. Although the meat could be a bit juicier, there's a nice charbroiled flavor to the whole thing. I think they forgot to add cheese on mine, but the mayo made up for it.

This location in particular is cool because its open 24 hours.. on the other hand, the employees weren't too friendly and the place wasn't too clean.. But aside from that!! This place has become a MUST for the bf whenever we go to vegas or even tahoe. He likes to get the triple king burger.. or whatever its called. the biggest one! if i'm really hungry i'll get the fatburger with bacon and cheese.. if im not as hungry i'll get the babyfat burger which is a cute little burger haha.. My friends ordered theres with egg and they said it was really good, too. I like the chili cheese fries as well. Yum yum.. wish i could have some right now..",

At night they have bartenders who flare and  play good music like Kaskade (and similar artist) that makes you want to get your food and fuel for the next party. During the day it's just a nice shaded spot  which I can personally hang out at for hours until the sun goes down. The food is excellent but do not expect any healthy alternatives if you are watching your weight but who can stay on a diet while on vacation in Vegas, what is the point? The inside of Fatburger is for the families with childern to help shield them from the drunks and exposed bodies that walk the strip. I have only walked through to use the restroom :)...which is a disaster but you win some you lose some.",

They were a bit dry and not too flavorful but the toppings I picked helped make up for it. I topped my medium sized burger with cheese, bacon, an egg, and the obligate onions/lettuce/mayo combo. I absolutely LOVE getting a fried egg on my burger because it adds a nice rich creaminess to the experience. I was underwhelmed with the toppings offered but the standards they do offer (and the fried egg, of course) will be enough for most people.   I tried their skinny fries but felt they were bland and boring, and I wasn't into their super thick onion rings either. If I were to go to Fatburger again I'd probably try their dogs or chicken sandwiches just to see how they stack up but I think if you're in a pinch and hungry late at night while passing by, it would be worth it to grab something here.  Though you are in Vegas, so if you're not too intoxicated or tired to walk a little farther then you'll probably find better options within a block.",

So maybe the boys from Swingers wouldn't have made a stop at Fatburger, but what the hell..we were saving our money for the fun stuff, so tried to keep the midday meals to a minimum.  What can I say?  I haven't had a Fatburger since I was a kid, and wasn't sure what to expect.  I am a confirmed In-N-Out lover, so wasn't sure if I was going to be traumatized by trying something else out, but went for it on D's advice.  Hamburgers were great, fries good and the atmosphere...interesting.  It was a midday meal, so not really full of what I understand to be the partying drunk crowd that it usually gets late night.  But the music was blaring and there were plenty of people eating, so much people watching was available.  I enjoyed my visit.  Wasn't the best burger in the world, but it was good.  Wasn't the most relaxing of locals but it was fun.  Wasn't the most healthy of meals (hellloo!  FAT-burger, right?) but it was tasty!  Enjoy it in all its glutony and have a good time.  It IS Sin City after all.",

There was not very many people in the restaurant but it did take a little while for the food because the food is made to order.   While we were waiting we met a very nice lady from Utah who was with her family.   It is the typical fast food burger joint that has a lot a kids working.   3 stars because my husband's burger was pretty good and typical of Fatburger.

    "text": "24 hour burgers on the strip.  This was my first Fatburger experience and I got to say that they have a good thing going.  I would put them above most fast food spots, but I don't think they top in n out.  I love the fact that you can get steak fries (the best choice), but the regular fries are better than average as well.  Generally you have to decide how much meat you want and that will determine the cost and size of your burger (they also have some other meat choices as well).  They have other toppings too, which actually makes their burgers somewhat customizable.  I seem to remember even getting asked what type of cheese I wanted?!?!? Bring on the cheese choice revolution. I found the prices reasonable for LV strip, and the wait (at 1:00p on a weekday) was about 25 minutes.  Don't expect a seat though, as the dining area was pretty crowded the whole time I was there and it almost certainly is worse at night. I didn't find the staff to be *fun* like other reviewers did, but they were certainly doing their job and that is all I really ask of anybody. I imagine if you show up at night you need to be prepared for a totally different scene that is less focused on the food and more on finding something to soak up all that margarita by the yard or random neon colored alcohol beverage.  I may visit at night just to see what the spectacle looks (and also 24 hours, relatively quick is better than almost every other option out there)",

Yep, a fast food restaurant actually beating a fine dining restaurant when it comes to serving! And no, it was not as if they were crowded. There were, believe it or not, just 4, FOUR people on the line. The poor guy in front of me had to wait 15 minutes just to be served up his soda. Oh man, it was so sad I almost laugh. And those clueless idiots (Pardon me) keep asking our orders for probably 5-6 times throughout the 30-minute torture.  The burger itself isn't that great, and is overpriced like hell. It was overcooked, dry and not juicy at all. And I finished a $3.50 burger with just 3-4 bites. Wew.  Just go to In-N-Out. I've not been to their outlet in Vegas but it would take something extraordinary to be worse than these guys.",

But fatburger defeated him! Chips/fries are great and the oreo milkshake. Only thing is they asked me first time if I wanted whipped cream on top to which I said no, but did't get asked second time. Didn't think anything of it unitl it arrived with a load of cream on top. yikes, not a fan of cream!   I'm just gutted we couldn't find it on our first night! I had read it was behind the MGM, which it really isn't! So went off in the direction of Hooters looking for it (obviously wrong way!). Being hungry in a new city, which was unbelievably hot is not a good combo when all you've read about for months before going away is fatburger and other similar  burger joints and you just don't want the usual mcdonalds.

Very  juicy, the best turkeyburger I've ever had.  I had to wait a little bit, but it was so worth it.  The second night, I had the baby fat burger with fat fries (steak fries). So good!   Because it's open 24 hours and most people do go there after the clubs you do get some sloppy loud drunks in there.  If you get irritated by those folks, just get it to go!",

But because of its location it seemed like everyone in Vegas was hungry at the same time so the wait for food was long then once I ordered it was about a half hr until my number was called. So service was bad.  Cleanliness was not taught to any of the employees there and the bathroom was hideous and smelled horrible.  Only positive was how delicious the food was despite the high prices.",

I and 4 of my friends went there to watch the game for our week trip to vegas and when we got there we were excited because they had our game on a picturea of enjoying a nice burger was dancing through our heads....Unfortunately as soon as we sat down the fat non paying barback changed the game so that he could watch his chicago bears play. With a look of disbelief at how he could so blatantly ruin our experience I kindly asked the bartender if he could change it back he said no he couldn't because it was on a revolving channel to which I responded we just sat there an watched your barback change it. After not getting any kind of help I an my friends got up an left. I know our bill would have easily been over 60 bucks a mere drop in the bucket for such a franchise but in the end fatburger has lost 5 paying customers for a lifetime . We ended up back at the time share with some Chinese food .",

    "text": "Food/quality: Great juicy burgers with tiny fries. It is fast food, but definitely a great deal especially late at night in Vegas after having some drinks during the evening.   Service: Service here is what I had a problem with. When I ordered for my boyfriend and myself, I had to repeat the order several times to the man at the register. He seemed to have trouble understanding our orders. For example, when stating that I wanted everything except tomatoes on my hamburger, he placed the order with tomatoes only. After continuously trying to have our order input correctly, I still had to walk up to the people preparing the food to have the order changed to what we wanted.  Atmosphere: Interesting crowd. I remember there being a drunk girl falling all over the place in line. The bathroom here was not worth using, so I waited until heading back to our hotel.  Value: Inexpensive quick meal, especially after you have already had a huge dinner elsewhere earlier in the evening followed by drinks.",

All this did was make me look like I was afraid, and you never want to show fear. I put it on the table.  Other posters have commented that the best bet is In-N-Out, but I also think their burgers taste like Wendy's.

Thanks to the beauty of expansion that dream extends as far afield as vegas baby...vegas.  I gotta say there is no better hangover deal on the strip than the aforementioned double king paired with fries insouciantly smothered in chili cheese and onions.    My one gripe about this place is that they don't make the shakes fresh so they tend to be a little more solid than I'd like, but hey at least they're real icecream",

See four other employees standing doing nothing.   2.Looked at menu and ordered breakfast burrito and side of ham steak, listed on menu for 3 dollars.    3.Told they don't carry ham steak.    4.Change it to bacon. Ask about what the \"bread basket\" for 10dollars is.  Told they only have English muffins now. The rest didn't sell we'll.    5.Finish order and choose to eat outside. Proceed to walk past the employee sitting at the bar drinking beer and watching basketball.    6.Wait for 20 minutes for my breakfast burrito.    7.Look around at the restaurant where no food is being delivered during the 20 minutes.   8.Begin to breathe smoke as employee drinking beer at bar decides to light up cigarette.    9.Wait 15 more minutes for food, only being asked how I'm doing once.    10.Get food, which was fine. Just ok.    11.Watch another employee behind bar texting her BFF or something. Had to get up and ask for silverware. Was pointed to where I could get it myself.    12.Finished food, getting asked by what looked like the janitor (he had been cleaning the metal around the bar, sweeping, etc.) how my meal was. Was tempted to leave him the tip instead.    13.Walked out without tipping and wrote yelp review, then wrote fat burger Vegas off my list.    I suggest you skip steps 1-12 above and start right at step 13.",

Ten minutes later, after making eye contact and waving at 2 waitresses, we still had no menus. We decided to sit at the bar. Best decision every. The bartender, receipt said Lyman, took our order right away and got our drinks to us in no time. When the kitchen forgot one of our burgers he went to the kitchen and brought out the burger. The drinks were very potent. He really saved our lunch.",

Fatburger is one of those places that just tastes great along with their fried. This year when we went, they added a FATBAR which has an outdoro bar, outdoor seating and table service instead of the inside, where you place your order after waiting in line and what not. the inside portion still exists but the outside is a very nice new add on. Love the burgers and love the 24 hours! try to eat there 2-3 times in my 5 day stays!",

Then, when I tried their burgers, I wasn't impressed, I've had much better elsewhere for the same price as Fat Burger. It was good to try once anyway...The only way I will get this next time, is with Groupon probably..maybe even not.   Its way to too crowded, again not worth. Also, the chairs outside, not comfortable. I like how they have a bar outside though. Not sure what they sell there, as I didn't order any alcoholic drinks, but still cool they have a bar outside. Fat Burger is also 24hrs, which is convenient. I think I'll come here next time when I'm way too drunk, not just to eat. LOL",

This location is on the Strip, near the Hawaiian Marketplace. You'll pretty need to park elsewhere and walk here. There's an inside area and an outside area. Since people-watching on the Strip is a fav pastime of my mine, we opted for outside.  The outside space is a circular bar with bar seating and then several high-tops. It's a seat yourself place. Unlike other Fatburger locations, this one has waitresses. So when you sit outside, a server will come and take your order, bring you your food, and bring you a check.  Also unlike other Fatburger locations, since this one has a bar, you can get beer and mixed drinks. There's also a slushie stand where you can purchase those crazy yard-long tourist concoctions.  The service isn't much, but that's kinda to be expected.  The food, though, is awesome. I thoroughly devoured my delicious burger and all the chilli cheese fries. If you're looking for a good, cheap-ish burger, and want to partake in some excellent people-watching, this is the spot for you.",

I have a thing about hotel food (don't), so I yelped to see what was around.  And lo and behold....RIGHT across the street from the Aria shows a Fatburger!  Hadn't eaten at one of these since I moved from LA, so off I went.  Typical setup - stand in line to order, get a #, go sit and wait.  But....the ordering....ahh.....first, a REAL burger, cooked to your specs.  Choice of size.  Choice of REAL cheese.  Choice of bacon.  Choice after choice after choice.  You know...like a REAL burger place (kinda knocks In-N-Out out of the category).   Ordered the basic burger w/swiss and bacon (I know, I know...that's so unlike me...(cough)), along with a small fries and a diet coke.  Received my meal about ten minutes later...and it was JUST like I remembered them...divine.  Definitely recommended!!",

I walked in saw a group of firefighters there, so that was a good sign to see the locals still eat here.  My burger was actually two patties, which was fine. They were cooked excellently. I splurged the the $2 for bacon and cheese on my burger.  It was pretty messy, but what good burger with lots of fixings isnt?  I was a little disappointed in the onion rings. They were home made there, but fell apart easily and not all that flavorful.    If you go, order a burger, stay away from the onion rings.",

The food here even though it is considered fast food is amazing. I am waiting for my fat burger now and enjoying a little people watching here in the lobby of the LV strip.   This location is convenient to so many restaurants in this immediate area. It is fairly busy too. The lobby is not crowded most seem to order and then enjoy their burgers on the go or at the bar. Their is a shady area for guests to enjoy their food outside. It needs a better way to keep it cool but some guests might enjoy the umbrella shade even on our 100 plus degree summer days.  The cashier was pleasant and friendly and took my order with no issues. While waiting for my food the only issue that came up was the fact that they do not have ice cold air conditioning for the guests. The skinny burger that I ordered hit the spot too. Plus it was less calories than the larger burger too!",

We asked for her to return and she happily agreed. Soon after, a large man named \"Brian\" came over to tell is that since we were not ready to order, we needed to \"go inside\" to order since the waitress was \"off the clock\". No one told us this prior to this interaction and Brian was quite rude stating \"you sent the waitress away so now you have to order inside\". Due to being so rude in his delivery and not even having less than 5mins to order, we decided to go elsewhere where we were treated much better. Perhaps Fatburger doesn't care about the customers, but we dropped over $200 in food, drinks, and tips for a simple burger elsewhere on the strip.",

One thing im not a big fan of is the use of shredded lettuce as it causes a mess when it falls out. Overall- glad I tried it, will definitely be trying other joints tonight",

Only one table when we showed up and we get our food after people that showed up after us, I mean it's a burger joint so shouldn't our burgers be done before those after? This location is conveniently located on Las Vegas blvd but the prices reflect the location as it's about double what a meal would be off the strip.  I always go with the big fat deal with cheese and fat fries cooked well done, they are consistent with the burger seasoning every time although they can be sometimes slow.  Very disappointed with the service at this location as all employees are looking at each other on what to do.  All in all this meal took 23 minutes to prepare and our order was bypassed",

Half-way through I discovered mayo on my burger. I told the woman who'd brought us our food and she was apologetic. She offered to remake it. I accepted, I just wanted to leave and forget about the $50 we spent on two burgers  It was late so I got up to ask her if it could be made to go. Finally as she brought me my impossible burger with no mayo, it was open on a tray. Upon my reminder she got me a bag but at this point didn't seem to care much either way. Is everyone in Vegas drunk, including the staff??",

I'm not a fan of the service though. It seemed like the waitress was bitching at all her customers and basically encouraging them to leave. I'd come back for food or drinks but hopefully on a day that service is better.",

Well, I was surprised how good the food here was. I got the 1/2 pound or whatever burger, and my friend got the turkey. The turkey burger is kind of mediocre - the patty is dry and thin. Their regular burger is quite good. Very satisfying for what is a five dollar burger. I expected it to be really greasy (probably because of the name), but it was actually just a very good burger. The fat fries are also quite good. I will definitely think about this place next time I'm looking for that cheap burger in Vegas at 3am...",

I always get an XL Burger which is 8oz. with everything plus bacon.  If Im really starving then I add an egg which is $0.99.  Awesome burger!  Cooked fresh and juicy.    2- This place is always dirty!  And when I say dirty, the tables are always dirty, the floors and especially the bathroom.  This time around the mensroom looked like someone threw up everywhere but in the toilet.  Gross!    3-  The cooks are lively, but the other employees who walk around doing whatever job their doing always look upset and disgruntled.    But other than that, great burgers!",

I went for the small cheeseburger and split and order of fries with friends. While the burger was definitely better than McDonald's or Wendy's or something, it wasn't amazingly life changing. I love the menu, the music and the overall experience of being at Fatburger, but I think I'll stick with my beloved In-And-Out.   When we walked out of Fatburger, Pac was still bumping on the speakers. Gotta love it! Nonstop Cali love!",

You had a choice to add a topping for 1 dollar each however you want it. I chose cheese and a fried egg which was nice.

What makes me give them an extra star above the normal three is that the cook suggested a new way to a favorite Fatburger staples: cheddar Fat Fries. Most awesome ever. How so? The cook melted cheddar at three different levels of my fries, not creating a cap, but actually soaking my fries in the greatness that which is cheddar.   Plain medium fatburger with cheddar was perfect and my shake was great. Service was greatly appreciated.",

Apparently they were having system issues and their computers were down so they were writing down orders and telling  the customers the bill would be brought to the tables. I ordered the original burger and a side of skinny and a side of fat fries. The food was brought to my table pretty fast. The burger was okay the fries were also okay. After the check was brought over to my table I got up and went to the register to pay and the manager standing there tells me to wait for the cashier because she's in the bathroom. So I wait. 10 minutes pass and I'm still waiting and he's still standing there trying to reboot the computers. 15 minutes pass and I'm still standing there without acknowledgement as 3 more employees are trying to reboot the computers. At 25 minutes the manager says: \"so are you paying cash?\" And I say \"YES\" and he says \"Ohhhh\" . So you're telling me I waited 25 long minutes standing up waiting for your system to work when allll along I could have payed cash? The least the manager could of done was apologized for wasting 25 minutes of my time but that wasn't done nor any sort of discount was applied. Talk about horrible business.

I opted for everything but the chili and I was quite happy.  This burger is a step up from In-N-Out but still not as good as a Royal Robin Burger.    The fries come in two cuts skinny or steak fries.  Nothing too special here. The onion rings were ok.    The Maui-banana shake is very good.  3.5 stars  In n out being 2.5 stars.",

They offer burgers, chicken, turkey, and veggie burgers so they are sure to please any crowd (drunk or sober).  They have killer steak fries and their add-ons (egg, cheese, etc) make the possibilities endless.  Plenty of indoor and outdoor seating as well as full bar options just add on the awesomeness of this place.    Long story short, when you're needing drunk munchies food on the strip, this place delivers.(not like actual delivery to your room/location, but more a metaphorical delivery).  Boosh.",

    "text": "So I've never had Fatburger and having it for the first time in Vegas was nice. Even though the place was filled, the food came in a timely manner. I got the original burger with cheese and Sophia got the veggie burger.   Quality of the burger was great. Meaty, had a chat and just tasted like a great burger. I was glad the smallest option had me satisfied. Since this one is on the strip, you could expect to pay a little more than you're used to if you've eaten off the strip. That being said, the burger and onion rings was about $15 but it was delicious. I like how they make it with mayo & mustard and no ketchup. That's how I like my burgers everywhere but if you want ketchup, there's a bottle on every table.  Since this is yelp, I know you're looking for a fair review so I'll talk about something's that we're so great. The bun was a bit toasted too much or maybe it was out of the bag for a while because pieces were falling off when I'm not used to that while eating a burger. Other than that, nothing really bugged me.   Even though this wasn't a perfect burger, I give it 5 stars because I enjoyed it, the fries were like McDonald's aka the best fries in the world and the service was great.   My favorite burger place is still in-n-out but if you're looking to try something different from that and shake shack, Fatburger will do the job. I'll definitely come back!",

It was really overdone on the outside, and didn't have almost any flavor. It was also small and misshapen. Not like a handmade patty, but one carelessly done.   My family loved theirs, though. And our waitress was great. Kept our beverages filled and was fun to talk to. We sat outside and the heaters were on to keep everyone warm. The music was also super fun.

What's not to like? Slap a load of bacon or a fried egg into your towering large burger, and the party in your mouth will be rocking. Just keep in mind that they're a relish and mustard joint, so don't expect ketchup or an In-n-Out spread in this. I actually think it's a better combo regardless.",

I walk up to the guy taking the order. It was my first time so, he explained how it went. So I did the original with the egg, fries and a drink. Everything was a-la-carte so buy what you need.  The skinny fries are really good, its almost as if I've finally found the only one that can hold a candle to Mcdonalds fries. I'm probably going to get crap for that, this is IMO. The burger is pretty good. Definitely well seasoned, the egg was over done which was kind of a downer. I would've loved to do the egg porn shot, but the yolk was super dry. No oozing liquid isn't very exciting to see.  I'd definitely eat here again. My dining experience was really good and enjoyed every minute of it.  Thank you so much for reading my review. I hope this helps with your decision making experience. Enjoy your awesome yelptastic day!!!",

I also ordered a beer which came with free fries, both tasted so good on a hot August day. The girls had three different flavored milkshakes that were super thick and cold.

We were able to order right away, and easily found a booth and waited for our food to come out. You can watch everything being cooked to order, which I think makes it different (and better) than other fast food joints. We both ordered a burger and we shared fries. We were able to choose \"skinny\" or \"fat\" fries. The cashier recommended the fat fries and they did not disappoint. The burgers were big, juicy, and flavorful. The fries came out hot and crispy.

You'll see all sorts of people in the inside from the business professional to the dirty street hookers. What's important is that they're actually pretty well behaved since they've all walked off the alcohol I guess. This place is crowded as hell and it will take you a while to get your food.  I ordered the king burger and a peanut butter shake and ate it all. The food was great but the waitline was just way way too long. We should have just gone through the drive through and then sat inside or something. (This technique works well at crowded In-N-Outs.)",

That's why a FATBURGER wins in terms of taste, size, and overall satisfaction. With a order of Fat Fries and a Large Coke. Yeah, now that's heaven. You can keep your overated, non-burger tasting in-n-out \"burgers\". Now, someone needs to bring a franchise to San Francisco.",

People often think it's weird, but you can't knock it till you try it.  So try it.  The menu here is very simple with 6 burgers to choose from.  You got the 1/2 pound Kingburger to the Veggie Burger and 4 other options in between.  After choosing the burger of choice, you have your add-ons.  This includes bacon, an egg, chili, and cheese.  I like to add-on bacon, egg, and cheese.  I leave the chili for a different style of burger, where I'd add on chili and cheese.  As for the sides, I prefer skinny fries as opposed to fat fries (more crunchy and less starchy).  For the shakes, they have 3.  The basic chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry.  Choose whatever you feel like for that day... that's pretty much what I do.  Same goes for the soda.    But yeah, focus on the burger and enjoy.",

When you stroll into fat burger, its like visiting an old school hamburger place. All the food is cooked to order and they make no attempt to disguise what there selling you....from fat fries to a fat drink, you know that whatever you consume will have enough fat to kill a rhino.  But as with most things in life even though its terrible for you, its delicious. The wait time kind of sucks, but the wait is worth getting something that doesn't resemble a hockey puck a la McDonald's.  Its also a little on the expensive side with two meals running me about $27 bucks, which for a burger and fries is a little much.  Overall this place is OK, nothing too special though.",

The quality of beef paired with the perfect combination of condiments makes fat burger a necessity on every Vegas trip.  I suggest at least a double burger with cheese, bacon, and a fried egg.  It's my belief that lettuce has no business on a burger but get it with everything else.  If you follow these instructions and are disappointed you may want to set yourself an appointment with a psychiatrist you just might be crazy.",

There was so much garbage on the floor, there was no way we would eat there.  I ordered the Fatburger and fries and we took it back to our room.  I definitely enjoyed the fries because I LOVE steak fries.  My burger was a disappointment.  It was super charred on the edges and the cheese was not melted at all.  The bun tasted a little stale too.  I may give Fatburger another chance if I'm ever around one...but that's only because my friend told me they have awesome chili cheese fries...",

A couple of years back I tried In-n-Out and it didn't quite stack up. This time around I'd figure I try out Fat Burger and see how well it fares. i must admit, I can see why they call it Fat Burger. You can get an XXL burger which is 24 ounces of pure beef goodness. Even this Texan isn't stupid enough to get that! I only got the large (8oz) fat burger with bacon, cheese, and fried egg on top along with fat fries and a diet coke. haha ok I kid on the diet coke. I enjoyed every artery clogging morsel and dare I say it was better than Whataburger?!?!",

You literally have to grab the first table or counter seat that opens up.  When your food is ready, a runner calls out the number and you just wave them over.  They bring you your food which is a nice touch for a fast food joint.  The burgers were great!  Greasy in a good way, with fresh toppings.  My husband and I tried both the skinny fries and onion rings, the latter of which really impressed me.  A little expensive but definitely worth it.",

I don't believe Fatburger can be found back in the Northeast, so when I came to visit Las Vegas, I had spotted Fatburger and wanted to try it.  Prices are a tad expensive on the Strip, but that's to be expected.  However, I didn't think that Fatburger was over the line in terms of price.  Fatburger allows you to order a burger with plenty of different toppings, all which makes a burger tasty and unique.  Not a perfect burger joint, but definitely a good burger joint to patronize.",

Tattoo parlors, porn slappers galore, bums cursing at you for not smiling (really?), those creepy statue people, some lady at a stall trying to sell a towel that wraps around a woman's waist (reallyx2?), some dude with a shirt that has LEDs on it (kinda like an updated bedazzle), and another dude trying to get me to go to the Grand Canyon.  They will ask me \"you wanna go to the Grand Canyon?\"  The best thing to do is to reply with a \"you wanna go to [insert horrible city here]?\"  I usually use Port Arthur, TX.  This area of the strip reminds me of the part of the Thriller video where the zombies come out of nowhere and scare the hell out of the girl...then MJ turns into a zombie for some reason....everybody dances and things get annoying.  The ghetto vortex is like that.  Kinda creepy and very annoying.  Watch out for the ghetto vortex and eat a burger at Fatburger.  It is a nice change from the fine-dining expensive restaurants.",

We knew something was up becasue ALL the cooks in the kitchen were fighting over the tickets the whole time we were there.. These people were SERIOUSLY disorganized and I can't be too sure but there was a large sweaty girl cook that appeared to be unable to read. Everyone kept pointing at the tickets and telling her what they said.   It took a total of 40 minutes to make 2 burgers and 1 order of fries. I got a medium which was about the size of a wendys burger with a fluffy bun and it cost $5 for JUST THE BURGER! Nothing special about it.. Except for the relish... sooo... congrats you put a hotdog condiment on a burger and thought it was special.",

    "text": "You're walking along the strip and you see an attractive woman in a skimpy red bikini on top of a bar, you take notice.  This is in front of the Fat Bar which is the patio portion of Fat Burger.  I'm not reviewing this as part of Fat Bar, because the sign says verbatim \"Welcome to Fatburger's Las Vegas Slushie Bar.\"  I always loved Fat Burger.  It's a big fat burger with fat fries.  Before they came to Reno, I always hit the Fat Burger here like a tradition.  Now, let's get back to what's important.  There are one or two hot women in bikini's in the front hawking over-sized margarita-flavored alcohol slushies.  The Las Vegas strip is super expensive as far as drinking.  I paid $20 for a drink to get into the Haze Night Club (it's free to get in so long as you buy a $20 drink coupon).  That got me a watered down vodka and Coke.  Yuck.  Then I paid $10 for a Sierra NV 12 oz beer.  After $30, I wasn't even close to feeling buzzed.  For $25 (using a $5 coupon) I got 55 oz of slushi strawberry margarita-flavored booze.  I expected it to be watered down a lot, but to my surprise, BANG!  It was LOADED with tequila!  I got drunk immediately.  So be careful.  I later blacked out.  I got the small guitar.  I know, it's totally touristy, but when in Vegas, be a lame tourist and live it up.  Trust me, the guitar gets you attention.  I had women taking photos of me with them and then they'd wear the guitar and get more photos.  Can you say chick magnet?  Too bad I was toasted by then and barely remember the whole ordeal.  None-the-less, the bikini beach bartenders were super friendly, and I'm telling you, there's nothing like drinking 55 oz of booze from a plastic guitar on a public street.  Unfortunately, it was the worst tasting margarita or dacquiri or whatever the hell they want to call it.  It was like pure corn syrup after the ice all melted.  It was hard to drink, but basically it was just a vehicle to help get the tequila down so don't expect craft, natural ingredient juice here.  Just swallow it down and get drunk.  I'm a craft cocktail snob, but this place isn't about craft cocktail numb nuts.  It's about the bikini bartenders, the guitar, and getting wasted on a public street in Vegas, and then blacking out.",

Walked our drunk butts back to the hotel ready to get our grub on...  Guess what?  We all didn't have any of the extras included in our burgers.  Not only that meat was dry with no sort of flavor at all.  Even though I was starving I only managed a couple bites before giving up.  What a waste!!

I swear, always find out who snores in your Vegas plans, and kick them out! Anyway my boyfriend and I hit up the strip to find out who the real Las Vegan crazies are. It was quite warm outside, even at the crack'o'dawn.   After passing a group of dude-bros standing on the corner reaching for Budweiser cans from the box they brought along, past the drunks staggering all over the place, a real live Elvis impersonator, past the barefooted club chicks who had long since given up trying to walk in their heels, we came across the 24 hour fat burger.  I could go for some fries and a milkshake...that sounded remotely like breakfast, I thought. Anyway, inside, we were greeted by the same group of people. Drunk club goers, dude-bros and many other interesting characters. The girls in front of us were leaning all over the registers screaming \"I want salt on my burger!\"...by the time we were served, the guy was either deaf or just a little slow. It took us 5 minutes to order fries and a shake. He kept asking, \"you want vanilla shake??VANILLA??\"  We set up camp in the corner by the window, and people watched till our food came. One fellow was using his soda cup as a barf receptacle. The girls who wanted salt on their burgers were now shouting about who's boyfriend was who's. When our food came we gulped down the tasty shake, and munched on our fries and discussed where to go next at 5:30am.   Definitely one of my favorite Las Vegas experiences!",

    "text": "I never thought I would enjoy Fatburger, because I typically am not a fan of the type of hamburger that is taller than it is wide, where you bite into it and about a pound and a half of condiments dump into your lap.  That's why in the eternal war of In-n-Out vs. Fatburger, I would take In-n-Out.  But for whatever reason, I really do like this particular giganto-burger.  There is the kitsch of the classic hamburger stand, the chrome signs and lineage behind the thing.  Add to that a very simple menu with lots of choices for your made-to-order burger.  And the ingredients are generally very fresh.  Some combination of that makes a burger that is a great experience, instead of just a placeholder next to a mess of fries.  This particular Fatburger is very hit or miss as for service times.  You can go in at three or four in the afternoon, or very late at night, and get your food in no time and find many places to sit.  Or you can go right at noon and be monumentally screwed.  This place doesn't scale well, so you might have to give up and move on to something else if you hit a rush hour.  Oh, and Mr. Pibb!  I always love that stuff.",

They have a self seat system which would work great if they had a way of knowing who just sat down. Usually once you order the waitress puts a number on your table, well here.. You sit to numbers already assigned to the table. It's just weird. You have to seat in a dirty table to get seats since it's outside on the strip but it might confuse the waiters since it looks like you just ate. We had to stop one of them and ask if someone can clear the table. The waitress took a very long time to get our order, bring the food and the check and I actually didn't mind the wait since we had good seats watching bystanders at the strip but I did see 2 different groups of ppl leave because they were never acknowledged. I didn't mind the waiting game but don't expect to sit and get your food fast, for those that are hungry it's definitely not a good place. In total, we waited about 10-15 to get someone to clear the table we got, another 15 min to get the waitress to take our drinks & order, another 5-7min for her to bring the drinks, 40-45 min to get our food.",

    "text": "Gluttony at its finest. This account is from my first and final trip to Fat Burger on the LV strip.  The second night of the girls' 21st birthday trip to Vegas was supposed to be our night to party hardy. Fat Burger brought all that to an abrupt halt. We spent the day at the Mandalay Beach, sun bathing and sipping on Long Islands and planning our evening. We then ate at Raffles cafe, drank some more, went to the room and cleaned up, drank some more, then hit up the Vodka Vault at Red Square, Ghostbar, Moon and Playboy and drank at each of those along the way. What... we were thirsty?  Hungry and desperate, we decide to get a snack before heading to the next clubs we had planned on, Tryst and Drais. Fat Burger put a halt on those plans because Tryst was scratched altogether and only half of us even made it to Drais.  Mistake: two of the four BZs ordered burgers bigger than they could handle.  Result: instant food coma, cranky and bitchyness. The two wanted to go home an sleep, thus foiling our big late night plans (now that our taxi rides would cost double and the fact I had to give some creepy promoter my cell phone number, for the greater good of the group, to get free guestlist at Tryst).  The service was S L O W, albeit, a lot of drunk people were there just around 12 midnight and the cooks were probably backed up a little. We had eaten probably 6 hours earlier so we needed to refuel. We must've waited at least 20 minutes for our orders.  OK, not so bad right? Wrong. One of the girls had severe implications from the FAT burger for the remainder of the weekend into Tuesday.... savage diarrhea and constipation. Trust, though it wasn't ME, we all had to suffer because she was queasy and cranky and was blowing up our hotel room's toilet at all times we were in the room. And boy, that bathroom door was paper-thin because we could hear it all. But we wont go there.  Fat Burger, thanks for being there, but never again. I'll stick with what I know and go to In-n-Out.",

    "text": "I have an exact plan of how I like my Vegas: It goes like this:  1. Get off the plane 2. Get a rental car (and pass out as many extra discount coupons [$20 off a weekly rental! Free upgrade!] as I can that I have from my Entertainment Book to the people waiting in line behind us.)  3. Drive as fast as possible to the Strip. 4. Pull into Fat Burger's parking lot 5. Order and wolf down a Fatburger with cheese, steak-cut fries and a strawberry milkshake. Only sometimes I deviate and get skinny fries. This is the ONLY order we do things in upon arrival. Even on our honeymoon, it went in that order...but those of you who know that we rock the \"NFP lifestyle\" can understand that there was really no hurry to get to our Honeymoon Suite. Gotta love Peak+ 4.    My first two visits were pure heaven. The following two, especially the last, left much to be desired. In a span of two years, the interior seemed to have taken a major beating, and it was just dirty. Ketchup all over the place, dirty tables...sometimes no tables to sit at if you go in the afternoon. During the wait for our food, I felt a strong need to wash my hands after using the soda fountain, getting my condiments, ect. Also, the employees seemed almost unhappy to be there, further making me doubt that they cared about preparing my food in a sanitary matter.  I gave 3 stars because good burgers DO live here! I've had them! I just don't know if I'm quite ready to go back. I'm ready to be introduced to the next best \"burger fix.\"",

    "text": "Let me preface this by saying that.. if i could give this place 3.4 stars i would (not 3.5 because I didn't feel strongly about rounding up another star, unfortunately.)  Its True the burger here are delicious - the condiments were generously piled onto the burger, and it was so perfectly wrapped (yes, the ocd side of me lights up at things like this). The fries are some of the most delicious fries ever.  I just had some, and I kind of want some more already.  They're so perfectly cooked - crunchy on the outside without satisfying any of the soft interior (I'm referring to the skinny fries).  However, minus 1 star because I have to say that it unfortunately reminds me greatly of another burger joint that I love much more (rhymes with mud suckers).  I know it's not fatburgers fault, but it is unfortunate that the burger reminds me too much of another (better) one I've already tried.  Please save the hate mail, loyal fatburger fans.. this is my personal and honest opinion.  Minus another star because I asked for mayo on the side and I found my burger fully dressed with mayo in my burger.  I could have let it slide, but my friend also asked for a burger without some of the condiments, and unfortunately his burger also came as if he has asked for a burger with everything.  I will recommend this place though - if you're in the area.  It isn't good enough for me to drive all the way to the strip and park in a club parking lot and have to walk around a bunch of drunk jackasses eager to prove how macho they are to some girl who is not even interested in them and deal with parking specifically for it though.",

Okay, you do have a nice bar set up outside...this is cool also, even for a person that does not drink such as myself.  Yet, your prices are crack head crazy!  I must admit, the burger is not already made, already pressed meat filler substance that most chain restaurants serves you.  You had real beef on your metal tray, and you can taste the difference.  The strawberry banana shake, and the chocolate banana shake was both awesome.  Fresh ingredients in those most definitely, which you verified by not having all the banana completely shaken in your shake.  Yet, you charge for everything.  You want both buns, another 50 cents. Cheese is $1, straw for your shake is $1, use the restroom is $1, and looking in the direction of the bathroom is 50 cents.    They made sure to have some of the decorum in a retro style diner set up, which was nice for nostalgia sake.  All in all, I think you should try this place at least once just to form your own opinions, but I know that my wallet will rarely make my way to this place, ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING that there are buffets that cost about the same price as a cheeseburger combo with the works!",

    "text": "First place I've ever been where an employee needs to unlock the door for you to the restroom!!! It was very strange. I just assumed that you would go up to the counter, get the key and do your thing. But nope, the guy walked back w/ me, unlocked the door and off he went. The thing that was also weird was that it was a multi person bathroom.  We walked in, we had never been here before, and it was a straight shot to the cash register. The way this place is set up is awkward and if there would have only been 3-4 people ahead it would have put almost back to the door. I could see how during busy times it would suck cause you would be stuck outside while standing in line.  We got up to the register and looked for a menu, there was none. All they had was a little laminated sheet that told you what the burger toppings were. They have a digital menu, but it is not helpful. In my opinion the screen moves waaaaaay too fast, you see something that looks good but then the screen changes. It a pain cause while you are trying to figure out what you want, you also dont want to hold up the line either.  We finally decided on our order and purchased 3 cheeseburgers, and order of fries, 1 soda and 1 strawberry shake and it cost around $45!!!  The burgers were VERY good though. The buns were butter grilled, the burger was very juicy and had a good flavor. I especially loved the crispy char on the ring of the burger. The fries were cooked to perfection. They give you the option of steak cut fries or thin...we opted for the thin ones. My strawberry shake was creamy and had chunks of strawberry in it. I am not sure what I was expecting in regards to the shakes. A lot of places I have ordered strawberry shakes from have just used the flavoring, so I was thinking it was going to be something along the lines of that. I am glad that I was wrong...these shakes were REAL ice cream and REAL strawberries. The shake took a little while to make, but it was totally worth it.  I would consider coming back here. The service was great as was the food. The price was just a little much for no more than what we ordered. If this was a sit down type of place and included a side and/or drink it would have been different. They were also running a Groupon deal, but it wasnt valid for this location.",

The place was so busy not one place to sit down. I think In & Out is much better than this place and taste much fresher. Unless we ordered the wrong burger... Plus it took awhile with them being so busy,  I think I will stick to In & out when I want a burger fast.

The burgers are great and we always enjoy it. My only criticism is that the sweet potato fries aren't as sweet as I'm used to, but that was no biggie. It has outdoor seating and they bring your order to you. There is usually always a bit of a crowd, which lets you know it's good. It's open 24 hours which is always a plus in Vegas, and it's affordable. Considering that we don't eat beef, they still have good burger options, even for us!

I ordered the XXL burger with bacon and cheese with a side of Fat Fries.  Next door was a full bar that was popping and I ordered me a large daiquiri to go with my food. The XXL burger was very Yummy and Juicy.  So Delicious.  The XXL Burger did cost a little more than I expected but the taste made up for the money spent.

(pay for one and get the second one free) It was the most beautiful day ever so nothing beats being able to have a light lunch and have a small (ok, med is the smallest available) burger.  We skipped the fries, onion rings - we just had burgers. You order inside, pay, grab your number on a stick and grab a table. Our server was spotty, saw her once only and then an Angel called Roberto took over to help us and he never missed a beat. LOVED HIM so much we called out a manager from his office to tell him what a great employee he had in him. It takes more effort to give a nasty complaint about someone than a good one, right? We will miss chatting with him, at least til the next time we come back! We had the best afternoon watching the Vegas world go by. The music was great and not too loud over the lunchtime. Our burgers came out hot, fresh, good-salty and cooked to order. It was busy and the food is cooked in the order it comes in of course so relax while you wait with a drink and enjoy the sights, tunes and staff. Next time I come here, screw it, I am cheating and getting the onion rings. They are to die for!",

Ssure enough when I looked at the menu and saw an XXXL Burger any skeptical preconceptions on whether this was a serious burger joint were answered.   \"NUMBER 8\" screamed the portly Hispanic cook from behind the counter over an Eminem song playing from the Internet radio juke box, signaling me to pick my order up. I ordered some fat fries and a large burger with the works. The burger was cooked just right, retaining the juices and the vegetables tasted fresh which is a plus in my book. The fat fries were piping hot from the oil bath.   Not entirely sure if the other Fat Burgers are like this, but the Vegas ambiance and tasty burger made me a happy customer. Simply put this place shouldn't be compared to McDonald's or Wendy's. That being said  they can serve the burger to me through a hole for all I care as long as it's good and  I don't get food poisoning.  Happy Vegas fooding!",

Fatburger is great because they're open 24/7 and they're right there just north of the MGM on the Strip.  So at 1 am when you and all your drunk buddies are realizing how many empty calories are in half a bottle of vodka, and that all the good restaurants in Vegas close at 10 or 11, you know where to go.  Sure it gets messy in there but you're too drunk or hungry to care right?    And you don't really want McDonald's do ya?  No.  No, you don't.  Oh yeah and props to Eli G for the burger inspiration, this guy lives and breathes the carnivore lifestyle:  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=4ZfcCa4m5RWvO4EFzfYm1A\">yelp.com/user_details?us...</a>",

Each burger will pollute your arteries with endless clots and empty your wallet in a hurry.  The actual establishment is nothing to rave about, but the array of burger combinations are to die for.   There is no bare bones about it, its the most successful yet simple concept there is to be:  Its a burger.  Its big.  And its fat.  Its delicious as a result!  I heavily endorse the KingFatBurger (i.e. Royal Fatty) and with the Ultimate Big Fat Deal.  Its disgusting when you think about it but oh-so-good when you put it in your mouth.  The greasy texture is completely ignored as the gorge temptation gets the best of you.  Vegas is the city of sin and fun, might as well have fun with your sins and eat it too.

The burger had onions, mustard, mayonaisse, relish, pickles, etc. I tasted most of the pickles due to its saltiness. I didn't like their fries at all, it was very bland.

Needing a quick sustenance snack, I stopped in to find burgers ranging from Small to XXXL. \"Ummm yes I would like a small please.\" Many have tried to finish the XXXL in one sitting I was told by my enthusiastic cashier. How could they? It's the size of a baby's head! The slightly larger than a slider Small Fatburger was more than enough for my snack. It was juicy and I love that you know it was made fresh and cooked on the flattop right after I ordered it.   If you're wandering along the strip, especially late at night, you might want to pop by Fatburger if you're looking for some nosh. Heck go buck wild and add bacon, cheese, and a fried egg while you're at it.",

Forgetting to add onions or removing pickles etc. It was just completely wrong! Not to mention when we took the food up to the front, they said it's not their fault. So whose is it then and what are we supposed to do? Eat the food we did not order for? Um no thanks. When we gave it back, it exchanged several hands and all they did was remove the toppings that were supposed to be there and added the ones we wanted instead of making a new order. I'm all for not letting things go to waste but removing mustard is a little difficult since the bread absorbs it. I was so disappointed and angry I didn't eat it. I ate the skinny fries which was good. We also got Oreo cookies and cream milkshake which was super delicious. Hence why I gave them two stars instead of zero!  We came here around midnight but it was still busy. Prices are so expensive for a burger the size of McDonald cheeseburger and a kids size fries! The chairs and tables did not look wiped down and the trash was full. They have a lot of people working there so I was quite surprised to find it unkept. I did notice a few employees talking to each other or hanging by the bathroom. They really should delate the work to everyone. Maybe whoever made our orders was busy and needed help. Alas, I will not be coming back.",

Anyhow the place is clean, def a good spot that'll be open no matter how late you're up on the strip.",

Sadly, I had to wait 20 minutes for just one (1) chicken burger and some Fat Fries to be made, while the restaurant was widely empty!  I didnt understand what took the kitchen so long to assemble a burger, but service was just super slow. period.    Would I go back?  Nope! The Hawaiian chicken burger was just alright and the Fat Fries were meh.....meaning that both were soooooo not worth the wait!!!  Price was not cheap; total 14 bucks. GRRRRRRRRRR i felt furious.",

This place wasn't bad, however I prefer In-N-Out over Fatburger if I were to live in the western US. If only the In-N-Out in Las Vegas was actually on The Strip proper...but I did plan to explore more next time I'm in Vegas.  I had two medium Fatburgers with onion rings for one of them. Believe it or not, the onion rings here are much better than the burgers. I love o-rings that are huge in size, and the fact the onions were also large in size (it's not just batter). This place has both aimed spot on! As for the burgers...I like the fact there are different sizes for the burgers, cause there's no way I'm eating a XL. I also like the fact the burgers are lean beef, so it's less unhealthy for you, although that might have contributed to why I find the burgers not as juicy as In-N-Out.  Again if I had to choose between Fatburger and In-N-Out, it's In-N-Out all the way. However Fatburger is also a great choice for those Vegas folks who don't wanna leave The Strip and want something that's not a buffet or splurge restaurant for a change.",

    "text": "Thought my tip would suffice but seeing some bad reviews of the place I just need to put mine in.   The first time I ever tried Fat Burger was maybe three years ago. I never had any reason not to go to In N Out for a good and fast diner burger. But one drunken night we were in some casino (Red Rock?) where there was conveniently located, a Fat Burger. I can't deny a good old fashioned burger drunk or sober so it was on.   I'm not dumb or close minded so I wasn't gonna compare them to In N Out or any other burger. Not every burger wants to be an In N Out burger, some burgers just wanna be themselves damnit. I really like this fat guy! He's more than doable for me and I was an instant fan.    Plain hamburger all day every day. I'm old school. I'd eat it between sandwich bread. The patty is hand formed and made to order and while the flavor is not out of this world it is close to out of the ballpark for me. Not bad at all. I've returned many times to this location.   Speaking of which, you'd think it's my favorite Fat Burger since there's a full bar outside. Nope. It's actually my least favorite and specifically because of the bar. The service out there sucks big baseballs. Doesn't matter if it's winter or summer, they be freezing. I've never seen so many man bitches. Soo rude and grumpy and not taking any pride in the place like the other workers inside and at their other locations. That's what confuses me. The workers inside at the counter where you order your food are excellent just like the guys at the casino. The manager here was professional and even the cooks were upbeat. I felt extremely welcomed inside and then entirely snubbed outside.   But unless I'm feeling sensitive, it's the food that I really care about. I'd eat a decent burger from a Yankee fan I would. This here will be my drunk burger.   I've had the garden burger which I liked fine, but I love frozen garden burgers, so. I tried the turkey burger and it was also fine so I stick to beef since we're all so fine. I prefer In N Outs protein burger because I like the full lettuce wrap as opposed to a salad set up they have here. I'll add bacon and cheese to my burgers if it's one of those nights but if I'm really trying to party I'll add an onion ring to a plain or cheeseburger. Hell yes. The onion rings are what keep me comin. Home run baby. My fave onion ring I've found in burger land.",

A few other spots have the BOCA patty but all the other elements that make their burgers come no where close to taste and portions like Fat Burger does. They also offer a GARDEN patty but something about the hearty taste of the BOCA wins. They use a 5oz patty instead of the 3oz like the other places use, it's meatier and filling. A giant plus.   Their combination of mustard, lettuce, tomato, pickles, relish & onion are simple and delicious. I order mine with extra pickles and both raw and grilled onions with no mayo, so satisfying. Order with fat fries and you won't regret it.  One complaint, get a gluten free bun that doesn't have egg in it!!!",

I found that to be really rude because my group had a lot of people and the ordering process might have went faster if another employee cam to the register.   I ordered the turkey burger and steak fries. I was really please with the way the burger turned out. The turkey was not dried out or flavorless. However the young lady that dropped the burger off to the table had a massive amount of weave in her head. I am not knocking her for that but if your going to serve food I personally think you should have all of that hair in a bun to avoid it from touching my food. Overall the food was really good and the cashier was great but the other areas discussed needs lots of improvement.",

As i ordered my burger i told the cashier no bun and ended up with a bun anyways, and i didn't want to send it back because i don't know what the cooks will do to my food if i send my food back. I good thing about it was my oreo cookie shake was soooooo delicious, don't know what type of ice cream they use for they shakes, but it was very good. Just might return for a shake next time.",

    "text": "I can see why people will love this place while drunk, but sober me is reviewing it and I think other burger places do it better.  I'm currently comparing this to In N Out.  I'm from Florida, so we don't have Fatburger or In N Out, which is why I had to get both on my trip here (I'll try Shake Shack tomorrow).  First disclaimer, I love In N Out, so this would have had to be pretty darn good to beat that.  Unfortunately, it did not live up and it even somewhat disappointed.  First the good, the burger meat is solid.  I got the turkey burger, sans bun, with cheese, and it was delicious.  The shake is also pretty good.  It had a huge heaping of whipped cream on the top that I enjoyed.  The bad, the price is insane.  I got a turkey burger, chili cheese fries, and a milkshake.  Total was $20.  At In N Out, that same meal is $10.  I don't know if it is more expensive, since I'm in vegas, but holy cow.  Also, I was not impressed with the fries.  They were definitely not worth the calories.  I got the skinny fries and ended up throwing them out.  With In N Out I'm scrapping the bottom of everything to get the last remnants of cheese.  This cheese was just meh.  So overall, I wouldn't suggest wasting your calories or your money on this place.  But, then again, when you're drunk this place is probably heaven.",

Honestly it's a typical burger place but the burger and fries are A+. In my opinion they are better than in-and- out burger and I know people would kill me for saying that.  The portions are huge. And unfortunately the service is slow. What do you expect though?  They offer skinny fries and fat fries. Always fat fries- always and I have to add cheese, bacon and egg to my burger. Oh yeah, and a Diet Coke because I'm watching what I'm eating. ;)  The best part about this place is that it's open 24/7 so you can get your fat on any time you want!",

We got an order of fries, a 1/3 pound burger, and a veggie burger. I bit into my veggie burger and the first thing I said was \"this is delicious, it tastes like a Big Mac!\" Hooray again!  We get home and I start adding the places we visited to my Yelp bookmarks. What's this I notice? Oh, I already wrote a review for Fatburger! What does it say? Burgers for breakfast and it tastes like a Big Mac.  Whoa. O_o  What else can I say? Almost an exact repeat of last year, the food is great, I loved the shoestring fries and the burgers were perfect! This is definitely worth checking out if you wan a fast food burger without the fast food stigma and grossness.",

This place is SO ghetto, which is funny as all hell since it's next door to the MGM Grand. In classic Vegas style, this location has a nifty neon sign, and is open 24 hours.  When we walked in, I couldn't help but snap shots of the interior. A gaggle of transvestites were carrying on and one noticed me, thinking I was trying to photograph them. I assured her/him I was really taking photos of the establishment.  I shared a turkey burger ($5) with my friend which wasn't bad, to start. I took a bite, chewed thoughtfully, took a few notes, then proceeded to douse mine in Tabasco. It's no In-N-Out, but it'll feed you. (I heard that I should get one of their specials, and top it off with a fried egg... next time!)",

The burger itself is really greasy. You can order the size you want (from S - XXXL) and can pay extra for additional cool toppings, such as chilli and fried egg (I'd recommend these). The burger comes with mustard, mayo, relish, shredded lettuce & tomatoes. The burger as a whole's pretty good. I like the toppings that they put in there.  Conclusion: The burger's pretty good.

Our sad tale begins by being greeted by our waitress, a woman that would make a skank look classy.  She took our order for a couple of beers and for our food.  She returned 10 minutes later with our beers, but that was the last that we saw her.  I guess that on some level, I should have been thankful. Any prolonged contact with our server would have ensured an incurable case of syphillis at the very least.   Did I mention that she was dirty??  After 45 minutes of waiting for the food, our beers long dry, we sought out our server to find out what was going on.  Upon finding her, the skank threw us a lot shade, and even had the nerve to state that it was my fault that we had been waiting so long.  Yup...skanks truly are dumb.   At that point, I decided to minimize my contact with my server without having the benefit of a hazmat suit and found the manger.  Of course, he offered to get us our food right away, but we were pushing up on an hour at this point.  While this was all going on, my herpes scarred waitress was screaming that she had done nothing wrong....except be a waste of human life that is.  The manager saw what was going on and offered to comp us our entire check.  That being said, we thanked him, but told him tht he could keep his crap food because my guest and I just wanted to get the hell out of there.  This dump really needs to get a handle on its staff.  Avoid this one at all costs people.    You've been warned!!",

Perhaps it's sprinkled with a ghetto-fabulous dust that has the same addictive qualities as coke (I believe this dust is sodium and lard-based).  For the two of us, we ordered about 60 dollars worth of food. The food isn't good, but if you feel the craving of a pregnant lady itching inside you for fried and greasy food that will probably dissipate the moment holy water ever touched it, this is your place.   We went around 3am and it was still open, so yay for the hours.  I got some oreo shake concoction, and it was so thick that when I turned my cup upside-down, the shake was still in place; not one drop leaked out of the cup.  We ordered the chicken burger, 2 other burgers with assorted toppings, hotdog, chili fries, onion rings, beer (from outside), and the shake. After all, we had a checklist for things to do while in Vegas, and our list was basically a list of the 7 sins. Gluttony, check.  It was all very wrong, but felt so right.",

When you're wrong, just say \"sorry\" and put the damn cheese on - don't argue with the customer. Won't be back to this location. Hit up one of the station casino locations instead.

I had so much love for this place before, but what did I ever expect from a fast food place on the Strip? Good luck eating here. I hope to revive my love affair for the Fatburger establishment one day, but not on Las Vegas Blvd.",

But if you can get your eat on during regular hours, then go to in n out on dean martin via a cab.   Had the steak cut fries and burger combo, next time i'll have to try the skinny fries or the onion rings.    Nothing special, but if you have to get your eat on at night then a decent option.",

    "text": "I first went to this Fatburger a few months ago when I was in Vegas for a friend's bachelor party.  The burgers are AWESOME, especially for a fast food joint.  I used to think In-And-Out was the hidden fast food burger gem on the west coast...but Fatburger passed them up!   Fast forward to last week.  I was back in Vegas with a few friends and one of my friends had a Triple King Burger (three 1/2 pound patties).  If you finish this monstrosity, they give you a free t-shirt and take your picture to put up on the wall.  He finished it and got his picture taken.  They were out of t-shirts though.   A few nights later, we went back.  I ordered a QUAD King Burger (trip-King + 1 extra patty) to one-up my friend.  After consuming TWO POUNDS of delicious hamburger, I instantly regretted my decision.  The burger was awesome (as usual), but I was disgustingly full.  They were still out of t-shirts, and their camera was broken too, but I didn't care.  Right after we left, one of the cooks came outside after me to shake my hand.  I LOVE FATBURGER!",
