Second, the mac and cheese is horrible, the food is cold, the bacon is limp and the corn bread has no taste. For a $21 buffet I expect high end fresh food. Not typical buffet food that lacks taste. Not to mention their food signs are incorrect. Don't waste your time. Just go to dennys down the street.",

And I haven't returned either. Let's be honest. You get what you pay for. The flamingo is obviously an older hotel. So their standards aren't really up to par.  First of all, I will say. Their dining area is nice. Only because you can stare at the different animals outside. From their huge glass windows. They have, of course flamingos, wild birds. Koi fish in the ponds, ducks. And other mammals I can't remember.  Now the food is another story. It's not fresh. They don't have a big selection. And they have maybe two chefs helping you. One for crepes, and the other to carve your cold prime rib. It's kinda depressing to be honest. The dessert section isn't any better. In fact it just straight sucks. Tried this place twice and both times were exactly the same. Disappointing. Oh well on to the next buffet.",

The food was good, although there was no crepe person on duty that morning. However, the playing card suite-shaped mini waffles made up for that. And they weren't too soggy. Biscuits and gravy were pretty good too, and so was the omlette station cook.  Coffee wasn't great and mine had some grounds in it. Overall, I'm not sure I'd pay $18 for it, when I could get the same price for better tasting food from a restaurant (albeit a lower quantity).  BTW, valet wasn't open that early in the morning.",

There was also this old lady walking around muttering to no one that they didn't have a very big vegetable selection which I agreed with.  Quite a \"garden\" it was.

    "text": "\"At midnight every self-respecting casino premieres its $1.50 buffet--the eighth wonder of the world, the one True art form this androgynous harlot of cities has delivered herself of.... We marvel at the Great Pyramids, but they were built over decades; the midnight buffet is built daily. Crushed-ice castles and grottoes chill the shrimp and lobster. Sculptured aspic is scrolled with Paisley arabesques. They are, laid out with reverent artistry: hors d'oeuvres, relish, salads, and sauces; crab, herring oyster, sturgeon, octopus, and salmon; turkey, ham, roast beef, casseroles, fondues, and curries; cheeses, fruits and pastries. How many times you go through the line is a private matter between you and your capacity, and then between your capacity and the chef's evil eye.\" -- William Pearson (in his 1965 novel, The Muses of Ruin, describing a Las Vegas buffet)   Whilst discovering the above quotation in Wikipedia, I was surprised to learn that the \"all you can eat\" buffet is said to have been first introduced in 1946 by Herb MacDonald, a Las Vegas hotel manager. I did know that eating at a Vegas buffet is a quintessential experience one must sample if their visit to this town is to be truly memorable. My friends and I didn't want to leave deprived in this regard, so we pre-paid for Flamingo's version for a Sunday morning (our departure day). For days, when I walked by, I monitored the line in front of the buffet room which always seemed to be unappetizingly long. I was a bit worried we were in store for a long wait and a big disappointment.   However, when we arrived at 9:00 AM on Sunday, there was not another patron in sight! Over the course of our brunch, a few other folks wandered in, but the place remained essentially empty. Because of this, we were offered a prime table with a great view of the garden, waterfalls and flamingos. Our excellent waitress kept our champagne glasses brimming throughout.  My first foray to the buffet table landed me the \"heart healthy\" portion of my meal--salad and fruit. What I sampled was fresh, crisp and sweet. I particularly liked the prunes (go figure).  During my second, third and fourth forays, I abandoned all intentions of health consciousness and scarfed on a huge omelette, prime rib, more prime rib and just about every other fat-filled, cholesterol-laden, blood pressure-increasing concoction available in their impressive spread.  Ref: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_kb6GT4qawjwq47OsQ52xw?select=9yCceoQVfkBnaI1pCC8b3g\">yelp.com/biz_photos/_kb6...</a>  When it was time for dessert, I realized I was already completely stuffed and just sampled their cheese plate and some wonderfully tasty dried figs. They reminded me of my Grandmother's figs dipped in brown sugar that she dried under glass in the sun back in the 60's.  A dose of nostalgia on a full belly is always good. It was a great way to end our trip to Vegas and I definitely got my money's worth. I didn't even suffer the following day.",

    "text": "Paradise is one of the tagging along buffet for the 24hour Buffet of Buffets (BoB). We decided to visit because we wanted to have a relaxing breakfast/brunch, and Paradise is the right place for it, if you don't mind the food.  We asked for a window seat, and they were great to accommodate us. So I got to watch Flamingos, koi fish, swans, and other creatures roaming around the habitat while enjoying my food. I think the experience alone is worth the dollars spent.  There weren't a lot of choices offered at Paradise, and the food were just average. They had cold crab legs for breakfast, which tasted salty to me. There were different toasts and bagels, and other breakfast items like eggs, hams, etc. Oh, there was a crepe station, and the nutella crepe I had was pretty good.  We ordered only one \"all you can drink\", and at first I asked for a Bloody Mary. The server was nice to mention that the Bloody Mary was spicy, which was exactly what I was looking for. As I was sipping my Bloody Mary, I asked for a Mimosa next, and the server told me she could only give it to me after I've finished my first drink, since we were a party of two and only one of us bought the \"all you can drink\". I nodded my acknowledgement and told her I just wanted to tell her in case she got busy, since I wanted my drinks to keep on coming. And that's what she did. As soon as my Bloody Mary sank to the bottom, she put down a Mimosa on our table. As the Mimosa slowly making its way into my lovely tummy, she served up a new one. That was really nice!  So... come to Paradise not for the food, but for the relaxing atmosphere and the wonderful attentive service! Price is relatively cheap compared to other buffets, and I think quite worth it if you come for breakfast.",

I've definitely been to most every buffet in Vegas and I can honestly say that this one is pretty amazing (you may want to reserve your opinions as I did spend 4 hours here for CHAMPAGNE BRUNCH).    I had the champagne brunch with a large group.  We were sat immediately and they didn't even charge us the crap required gratuity that most places charge you when you're in a group of 6 or more.  The food isn't exactly top of the top but it was definitely still tasty... A whole island dedicated to crab legs and shrimp (you have to peel the shrimp yourself, but eh.... Still worth it) AND comfort food galore!!!  Also, if you were like me and wandered, you found that there was a whole separate area dedicated to nom nom nom desserts!!!   For $26 each, we got 4 hours worth of champagne and all the food we can eat.  Not to mention the fact that our servers were really FRIENDLY... REALLY.  I know this isn't the Wynn buffet or anything but I would say this buffet is definitely a GREAT value.  TIP: Ask for Juana or Eddie to be your servers... They are PHENOMENAL.",

My parents were going to the meat cutting section of the buffet asking for turkey and sausage but the server pretending not to understand what my parents were saying and just standing there and ignoring them. It wasn't until I interfered and specifically said the name labelled on front glass. They had to specifically say kiebalsa for the server to do anything, pointing at the food or saying sausage was not enough. It was absolutely ridiculous. Yet, when the next person in line who said sausage and simply pointed at what they wanted, they received what they wanted right away. When I went to a different station myself and ordered something I wasn't offered the same items as the next person in line. It was extremely obvious that some of the servers favored individuals who were not of a Asian background. This has never happened before in all my previous visits and if this is how the Paradise Buffet treat their guests, we will take our business elsewhere.",

It was memorable for me and I am NOT easy to please.  I won't compliment the table service and the selections are not great.  But they had everything I wanted so I'm speaking for myself. Our brunch waitress was really busy handling many tables.  But she managed to keep my mimosa flowing and I staggered out completely satisfied.  It's unfair to compare THIS buffet to others in the bigger and newer hotels.  The Flamingo is an old hotel.  But the ambiance at the buffet and the scenery was very nice and just right for the price.",

We hadn't eaten here in years but had good memories of the distant past. Most of those good memories were quickly erased. The old school feel and the view of the courtyard with the flamingos is still fun. The food, however, all tasted like it has been out on the line about 30 minutes too long. If you are willing to pay $58 for two people, self-serve your own beverages, and wait for them to bring out some fresh scrambled eggs you'll be okay. Stick with bacon, hash browns, and the scrambled eggs. Dump plenty of salsa and cheese on everything to add some flavor. Take one of the eggs Benedict and give it to a kid in a Golden Knights sweater. Tell him it's a hockey puck. He won't know the difference. If you get a comp buffet you'll probably be happier, otherwise it is very overpriced for what you get. There are much better places to have breakfast on the Strip. Harrah's/Caesars Entertainment seems to struggle with their buffets with one shining exception--The Paris. If you are willing to wait in line, go there.",

The main reason I would recommend dining here is because it gives you an incredible view of the habitat (aka real Flamingos). It's incredible!

I could actually see a person coming here just to look at the flamingos and wanting a place to sit to soak it all in.   The ambiance is 5 star. I wish I could enjoy the good food from other restaurants here. Most buffets are tucked into some basement (Luxor comes to mind) or stuffed into the last corner as an afterthought... not here.  Lets just say you want a decent view while you eat. If you have a car I would recommend Golden Nugget in downtown. It overlooks the pool and shark tanks. Food at Golden Nugget is great. Variety is not the strong point but what is there is simple and good.... Also, the best bread pudding on earth.",

Some of the meat at the carving station was weird (kielbasa?) and the sliced ham was cold. The omelet station was decent. Bacon was cold and the waffles were cold and hard as a rock.  There were far more lunch and dinner food items given the morning hours. Some of the food looked like it had been sitting out for days.   The service was very attentive, especially for a buffet.

She was downright rude from the get go, as her attitude was simply disrespectful throughout our entire breakfast. We should've gotten up and gone to a different breakfast buffet right off the bat, but we decided against it since we were looking forward to the bottomless bloodys. When we asked her about said bloodys, she looked at us, speechless, like we were insulting her by even asking. She demanded our id's and proceeded to drop our id's on our table and walk away instead of hand them back to us. Incredibly rude. When the bloodys did come, they were as plain as day and tasted like 100% tomato juice. We did not drink them. Don't be fooled by this marketing ploy, they are trying to rip you off. The food was below average, and even the ice cream came out of the machine like chocolate milk since they didn't bother to turn it on... Lazy and uninterested. I could go on and on about the entirety of the visit but the experience altogether was simply terrible. The worst service (Julie was downright nasty to everyone), below average food and drink, and a regretful atmosphere. With so many places to spend your money in Vegas, why go somewhere where you are sure to be disrespected and not get your money's worth? TAKE YOUR MONEY ELSEWHERE.",

It's difficult to understand how the same company that has the amazing buffets at Rio and Paris could serve such substandard food at the Flamingo. The food was almost uniformly awful, lukewarm at best, and while we were there, I heard a chef chastising a worker for keeping the temperature too low, which made me afraid to eat any of the meats. I honestly would have rather paid to go to another buffet, any other Vegas buffet I've had was better, including Bally's, which isn't all that great either.   It's a nice space adjacent to the gardens and waterfalls, so I hope that the PGB gets a major refresh as part of the ongoing Flamingo remodel, which is slowly but effectively transforming a lot of their dated hotel spaces into a hipper atmosphere.",

    "text": "Buffet of Buffets Marathon - Stop #2 of 7 10:30 AM  We walked from Caesar's Palace to the Flamingo to make it to this stop on the BoB tour.  I was already beginning to feel stuffed from the Caesar's buffet, but charged ahead anyway.  The line here was a little longer than Caesar's, but we were seated promptly and had a nice view of the pool area where the Flamingos & Swans hung out.  I even saw a Black Swan....cool! <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_kb6GT4qawjwq47OsQ52xw?select=auKWdF71D6A-MqzCJLsY-g\">yelp.com/biz_photos/_kb6...</a>  The 1st round we all went to the buffet near the entrance, which had standard breakfast offerings....we were a little disappointed that it was so small.  I grabbed a few Pastries, Eggs, Potatoes, and other stuff.  The food was so/so (2.5 Stars for this section)....then another Yelper Holly C said that there was a Crepe station in another room past the 1st buffet section....what?!  How did I miss that?! <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_kb6GT4qawjwq47OsQ52xw?select=7yWOGpZ5VrHcpL2YWdcYnQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/_kb6...</a>  I immediately went to investigate.....yes, there was another huge section of Desserts, a Crepe station, Chocolate Fountain, Donuts, and other goodies.  I ordered a Blueberry Crepe from the nice woman working the station.   <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_kb6GT4qawjwq47OsQ52xw?select=UIQgmkOtmg22t5-_inbfww\">yelp.com/biz_photos/_kb6...</a> <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_kb6GT4qawjwq47OsQ52xw?select=xbMwXlp78c3N82SeqQxvjw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/_kb6...</a> She was very pleasant and curious about what we were doing with attempting to eat at all 7 Buffets in one day.  She did a good job on the Crepe, which tasted awesome.  The other Desserts in the area were very good (4 Stars for this section).....but it really started to fill me up. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_kb6GT4qawjwq47OsQ52xw?select=J0YxypAGNZJLQZA9yc_rVA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/_kb6...</a>  Just when we thought we saw it all, we discovered that there was a 3rd section of the Buffet!!!  There's a Chinese food section that opens at 11 am....I was done, but a few of the Yelpers I was with went to check it out and said it was very very good.  Overall, this was a hidden gem surprise as we had low expectations for this buffet.  I wish I would have paced myself better so I could try the Chinese food....next time.  3 Stars weighted average for the Desserts and 1st section of the Buffet.  Incomplete on the Chinese food for me because I didn't have any.....other Yelpers loved it.  Return Factor - 72%",

I almost didn't go to breakfast here this morning because of the reviews, but then decided in the end I know I can drink 20 dollars in mimosas very easily if the food actually sucked. I had eggs Benedict, pizza, waffle, corned beef hash, and a custom omelet. All of which was warm and tasted great. The pizza was fluffy and tasteful. My eggs benedict tasted like it should. Omelet was filled with ham bacon and cheese just how I like them. My waffle was yummy with the house syrup and the corned beef hash had amazing flavor! Then I also proceeded to drink 5 mimosa :) unlimited mimosas are wonderful! Oh and waited till later to write review to make sure I didn't get sick. And I feel good!",

    "text": "This review is long over due. Me and my bf came here about a month ago. We went for breakfast and we loved the food! The host seated us at a real nice table. We sat byvthe window and got to see their live flamingos which were surround by water with coy fish and turtles. We had their ham, French toast, eggs benedict( which I and my bf absolutely loved), breakfast potatoes(were ok, but my bf liked them) mimosas (yummy) and some cereal. Everything was great. Until we met our server. Please keep in mind me and my bf have never been to a buffet in las Vegas. Our sever (I think that's the title) Julie was absolutely rude! We were seated by the host and she put our receipt on the table. We didn't know that we where suppose to leave it there so my bf grabs it. Julie abruptly was like NO, NO, NO, NO. We stop dead in our tracks and thought we did something wrong. She tells us to leave the receipt on the table. Then she asks did we want something to drink we said oh were going to get mimosas( not knowing we didn't get water, juice, etc. on our own) and with a snide remark \"so you're not getting something to drink.\" And were like no...I guess not. Again puzzled by the attitude. Then we finally started eating and when we were done she would come by and just grab our plates and not say anything. I also noticed that she was very pleasant with the other customers. So it had me puzzled once again to why she was being rude to us. So other than that we really enjoyed their food and will be avoiding Julie if we come here again.",

We are not frequent Vegas people, only there for business, so this means we don't get a nice seat? Again, Flamingo does not care about guests or apparently repeat customers.",

The staff was friendly, attentive and helpful, but there's not much selection nor was the food anything special.   The big gripe I have about this place, which might not happen every night, is the carving station was slow because everyone was wanting their prime rib cooked more.  As the carver would cut each slice and cook it on the grill before getting to the next person, a line formed that started blocking all of the items to the left of the carving station. It eventually wrapped around the back half of the salad bar. After waiting in line to get inside, people were waiting in a 10-15 minute line to get food.   If you're staying at the Flamingo, maybe it's worth a shot because of its convenience, but don't go out of your way to come here.",

After they kept taking people from the preferred member line, I got irritated. They lost a star for this. Note to management - I get that you have preferred members, but once they show up in line, how about alternating one from each line so that you don't piss off potential new preferred members!  We were seated and there were plenty of open tables. Like one of the other reviewers, I was baffled by the long wait.  The food was not great but pretty good. The wait staff was very attentive and kept our unlimited Mimosas and Bloody Marys coming.  Because the cost after Groupon discount was about $16 per person, I bumped them back up to 4 stars. I may or may not go back as there are still other good buffet deals to be found in Vegas.",

Forget getting a refill on coffee, such an inconvenience I suppose. Many tables had piles of dirty dishes.  No separate dining area for Total Rewards Diamond Members.  The dining area is dingy, worn, and needs an update. Food is ok and not a big buffet selection. Not worth it.

    "text": "So we experienced this buffet together as a family today for breakfast. 21.99 for an adult and I believe 10.99 for children for ages 4-12. With the ambience I would actually give it a four but took away 1 star for the bad stuff. We asked for a table near the waterfalls so that the children could see outside. The maitre di did accommodate our request which we appreciated. Also what I did appreciate about our waitress was that when my three year old spilled an entire glass, yes an entire glass, of orange juice on my lap, she did everything in her power to try and help me by getting some warm towels for me to wipe off.  OK now for the bad stuff. Watery scrambled eggs. Slow. Slow. Slow. You get the point. Service. I think I had to ask for Diet Coke two times. I think I asked for coffee a few times. The line for the omelette station was long. I think there was a guy in front of me ordering six omelettes. They spoke in Spanish and seem like they even knew each other. Because it took almost like 20 minutes for me to get one single omelette. I don't get it. Also, just the line to get food seem like it took forever..  I don't know if I'll ever be back, if I did I would at least know what to expect with the slow service. If I did come back I would probably do the deal where you spend about $50 and you can eat at five different buffets for 24 hours. That way you can actually get your moneys worth and experience different locations. So if you're unhappy with one you can just go to another the next day. I would also suggest going maybe earlier in the day for faster service.",

    "text": "Part of Vegas's intrigue (for me, at least) is the Buffet of Buffets tour, an all-access pass to some of the best buffets the city of sin has to offer!  For 24 hours after time of purchase, your buffet credentials allow you to literally pack it in, to be the glutton you've never before dared yourself to let loose and become.  This--and more!  Much, much more!--for only $59.99.  My review, then, reflects our complete and utter indulgence--our loosened belts and the imminent guilt--touring the Buffet of Buffets.  Flamingo's \"Paradise Garden Buffet\": (Lunch, $21.62 without the pass.) Flamingo's--besides the fact that there are actual flamingos, beautifully pink and spindly-legged, roaming the campus (you can even see them from the Buffet)--isn't my favorite hotel along the Strip.  It's no surprise, then, that their Buffet isn't my favorite either.  I mean, there's nothing really wrong with it, but in comparison to the others with the Buffet of Buffets, Paradise Garden is much smaller, and, in being so, has a smaller selection.  Although the service was great, many smiles, \"hello's,\" \"can I get you anything more's?,\" and \"goodbye's,\" it isn't quite as colorful and exciting as the others.  I wasn't nearly as eager to get started as I was with the others.  BUT...no other buffet has flamingos!  Three stars: simply due to limitations.  Paris' \"Le Village Buffet\": <a href=\"http://yelp.com/biz/le-village\">yelp.com/biz/le-village</a>-... (Breakfast, $21.99 without the pass.)  Rio's \"Carnival World\": <a href=\"http://yelp.com/biz/carnival-wo\">yelp.com/biz/carnival-wo</a>... (Dinner, $34.99 without the pass.)

    "text": "We went here the morning of our last day before heading home.   The line to pay was about 10 - 15 min long, but moved quickly. It was about 10:30am and perfect for brunch. Weekday brunch costs 21.99 unlimited.   Once we paid we waited about 5 mins to be seated. The Asian ladies who seat guests seemed to be having a rough morning and were not the friendliest to deal with. The restaurant was going through some construction to the center and other only thing preventing you from falling in dirt are some black curtains held up by PVC pip. As we walked by you could hear the workers complaining about some drama ect.   We were seated in the second patio-like area. There is no outside seating. However the tables that line the outside glass walls back up to the flamingo lagoon. the view was lovely being able to see the flamingos, and waterfalls.   The booths and tables were clean and ready for us to sit. We sat to wait for our waitress to take our drink order and waited about 5-10 minutes before she arrived. We both ordered orange juice.   The brunch buffet had a ton of choices, classic breakfast options included an omelet station, and crepe station. Plus a full salad bar, and various other lunch options. Carving station had turkey break, sugar ham, sausage, and another option I cannot remember. Also served pasta, tacos, and Chinese food.  The desert bar was located around the corner which is were the crepe station was located. A good variety of breakfast baked goods, and even a good selection of sugar free options.   We enjoyed the food here and would come back.",

    "text": "In comparison to other Las Vegas buffets this is just okay, middle ground in terms of food quality, service and interior of the restaurant.   BUT we found a really great deal on Groupon which was a brunch buffet for 5 for something like $62 which included unlimited mimosas. We jumped on it. The restaurant also is along the flamingo pond so we asked to be seated by the windows, that was really cool to see the birds, koi fish, etc.   Our server was VERY slow to greet us, refill mimosas, etc. Not very attentive or friendly.   The food was so-so but I would come back for the price. They had a delish crepe station on the dessert side! Other desserts didn't look so great. The food was decent, they had made-to-order omelets, hot breakfast sandwichs, plenty of meat, salad bar, lox bagels, fruit, yogurt, etc.",

Go somewhere else. The only thing good I had here today was my salad and the scramble eggs. But how do you mess up a salad that you make yourself. Lol... turkey was dry! Thank god for water at the table. Even the service sucked. A line to be seated with many tables empty where people could be seated. The host lady seating people looks and acted like she just came from the local hospice center to work. I wish I could give this place a no start. Probably one of the worst buffets that I have visited! Place sucks!",

We didn't drink the mamosas or bloody Mary's, but if we did I'd probably give 4 stars. It's too bad it's under staffed, the waitress was had was really nice, she took our empty plates most times but I feel like they're all overworked. The older guy who made our omletes is so kind. We noticed that the food was never low for too long. Only complaints is I do wish there was more crepe options - there's only plain or strawberry - not fresh, it's kinda like a strawberry syrup to choose from so I just got the strawberry w/whipped cream & chocolate and sliced some fresh bananas over it - tasted pretty good. I'd go back with my family one day.",

They had all the fix ins for tacos but no tortillas anywhere to be found. The pizza looked dry and aged and like it had come out of a digornio box. The corn still had strings in it and the meat was super fatty. Unlimited drinks only included house sangria which was not so yummy and coors light, yuck! It was also really hard to get a second round of drinks because the service was awful. The woman skipped our table multiple times to go to larger tables and when we said \"excuse me\" she said hold on and walked away all stressed out about what appeared to be a big order behind us. It was not that busy so it was irritating that she couldn't even keep up with our table just because she had one large group.  Edit: I will say that the crepes were delicious and the woman making them was super sweet and lovely to meet",

The food is just ok. The service is atrocious. I'm still here waiting for a water, and the crepes guy is the worst. He snapped at me twice. I asked for strawberries and chocolate and he refused, only giving me strawberry because he said I had to order off only what was listed (chocolate and strawberry were both listed, but apparently combining them into the crepe was a step too far). When I tried to use the chocolate topper, it was empty. I asked for more and he rolled his eyes and complained that he would have to go all the way to the back, and he also didn't offer to put on chocolate topping from the giant vat of chocolate next to him. So, I walked away with no chocolate anywhere on or in the crepe. His attitude was seriously the worst. In contrast, I was at the Paris buffet last night and the crepe maker's tip cup was filled with tips because he acted professional. Look crepe man - you chose to work here! I paid for your service so drop the attitude. You lost a tip and a customer.  Ugh. Never coming back.",

We arrived at 4:50 on a Friday for dinner and there were at least a dozen people in the VIP line and 40+ in the regular line.  Part of the dinner buffet draw on the weekends is free wine and beer.  Food selections were interesting.  Prime rib, turkey, pork, sea food, and Chinese.  Crab legs were also a big draw.  Really no rhyme or reason to the food choices.  Food was average at best.  My wife thought it was fresh so at least it had that going for it.  Room itself was good but dated.  Great view of outside but room itself looked like 1985.  I loved gambling here, service was friendly and attentive but the buffet was really lackluster.  Hit other options.  My stomach actually bothered me after eating here.",

I walked in wi my boyfriend and this buffet was one of the smallest I've seen since coming yo vegas. It reminded me of the size of an old country buffet. The selection was not even that great.  The one thing that was interesting was the \"make your own quesadilla \" but too bad I'm not a big fan if quesadilla.  I honestly spent my time taste testing desserts. The cotton candy was awesome and the cheesecake pops were very yummy but I couldn't say the same about the main courses.",

    "text": "Went to the brunch buffet with some friends, and it was one of the worst experiences I've ever had in my life. Where to begin. The food was mediocre at best, which was fine because we had used a groupon and thus, didnt pay full price. However, the service was god awful. Our server was extremely rude. We had done the bottomless and the server kept telling us that she couldn't refill our drinks too quickly- so our drinks were constantly empty and she likely failed to check on us because she was trying to avoid giving us refills. Then to make matters worse, finally we did get a second round of drinks (about 30-40 minutes after we had been there), and our lovely server said that she was refilling our drinks \"as a courtesy to us\" and that she had other tables to take care of. Given the fact that 3 of my friends are in the service industry, we ensure that we aren't difficult, but I don't think it's too much to ask for a round of refills- in a buffet where that is the only thing that you are doing as a server. we asked for the manager, Linda, who we voiced our complaints to. Meanwhile, a few tables next to us was another group complaining about the terrible service. Linda said that she would \"look into the situation.\" Did not say she was sorry, or try to do anything to rectify our terrible experience. All in all, do not go here unless you want to eat sub par food and have terrible service. Not even worth it with the groupon.",

I would definitely recommend the omelette station, as it was by far the best part about this Buffet. The guy making the omelettes was super friendly and had great customer service. Other than that, the buffet was very \"meh\". The bacon was extremely greasy and the \"turkey potato hash\" was not good at all. Definitely not worth the price tag for breakfast, unless you're doing the buffet pass through total rewards.",

We only have previous visits to the buffets at Bally's and Paris as a comparison, but we were quite pleased.  We actually thought it was comparable to Paris, and a touch cheaper; and much better than Bally's.  The buffet itself was fairly standard I guess, but I did note an omelette chef that was still on duty when we were there in the early afternoon.  Apparently, there was also a made to order burger bar station that we didn't discover until we had started dessert (which was a great disappointment when I saw the results some of the other patrons got).  The dessert selection was better than both Paris and Bally's, including a crepe chef (which I acknowledge Paris has too).  Beyond the food, the price of the buffet included unlimited champagne, mimosas, and screwdrivers - which made the cost of the meal quite cheap when you throw 2-4 drinks into the mix.",

    "text": "We made a reservation for a group of 53 adults for the Sunday brunch after our wedding. Our total price was $42.66 per person, which included the brunch, unlimited alcohol, reserved seating, and skip-the-line entry (base walk-in price was $23pp). The brunch itself was pretty good & I liked that we were seated right next to the window by the flamingos.  I downgraded this review for 2 reasons. (1) We were offered mimosas & coffee right when we sat down, but the wait staff never came by again to ask if we'd like anything else nor offered us any of the other included beverages such as bloody mary's, beer, or wine. Service was bad, yet we were charged 21% gratuity regardless. (2) We signed a contract that required us to give a final count a week before our event. I gave the count, but we had a couple last minute cancellations and Linda Brookins denied a credit for those cancellations. I was aware of this as part of the contract so I'm not disputing the charge, but a few cancellations the day before would have had zero impact on Flamingo. (They're not buying more food & could have easily seated someone else in the vacant seats. Had I thought of it at the time, I should have sold the empty seats to people in the back of the buffet line.) To combat this greed & lack of flexibility, they get a worse review.",

Our waitress, Julie, was by far the rudest waitress I have ever encountered. She took 10-15 minutes to approach our table to take orders despite us waving her down multiple times. Her demeanor was cold and she took forever to give us refills of our mimosas. She also messed up our simple drink orders when all we wanted was OJ and coffee. The buffet wasn't even busy at this time. Food wise, it is just standard breakfast that you can find at your local Denny's. For $20, there are breakfast buffets at superior buffets like Mirage or Paris.   This buffet really shouldn't advertise \"bottomless\" mimosas when it takes the waitress 30 minutes to get you a refill. They serve you the mimosas in tiny plastic cups. You are better off gambling and ordering these from the casino waitresses as they were faster than our waitress.",

In fact, compared to the other buffets in Las Vegas, or even in buffets in general, there wasn't that many options to choose from. However, the food is honestly not even that bad! In fact, it's quite tasty and feels \"homey.\" There is a whole section dedicated to desserts for the sugar lovers out there. They have a chocolate fountain for yummy treats, cotton candy, cakepops, cookies, etc. The red velvet cookie they have there is delicious.   The service was pretty bad. My waiter has reached that time in age where waiting tables is probably not such a good idea. We were seated down fairly quickly, but whenever I'd ask for napkins or something, I wouldn't get them until like 10 minutes later. Sometimes the waiter wouldn't even acknowledge my question so I'm only left with an awkward silence. It takes them a little while to take away finished dishes as well. Pretty slooooow workers.  Not too bad of a buffet, but you're better of spending a little bit more money for a higher quality buffet.",

    "text": "This was the second buffet in seven on the Buffet of Buffets circuit.  This was definitely the sleeper hit of them all.  The ambience is very nice.  There is nice view of the gardens outside, complete with flamingos!  They have flamingos at the Flamingo - who knew!  This buffet is huge, but it doesn't look like it.  Make sure to walk around everywhere before making a decision.  There was an omelet station over by the windows that wasn't obvious.  And there are three different dining rooms.  The thrill of the hunt definitely comes into play here.  Also make sure to come after 11am when all the stations are open.  The Asian food stations at the end (with prime rib thrown in the mix for good measure) are amazing.  Great, unique desserts.  They also have a make your own soup station where you fill up a bowl with vegetables, noodles, and meat.  You get a choice of chicken or beef broth.  Very tasty.  The Asian station also has chicken feet, which I have never seen at a buffet.  The buffet also was serving crawfish, another unique buffet item.  A little too much work for me. See joe c.'s review from Flavors Buffet and his rant on peel and eat shrimp.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/flavors-the-buffet-las-vegas#hrid:n63ElO7rdNoo4rsMiQZi5Q\">yelp.com/biz/flavors-the...</a> That pretty much sums up my feelings on the subject.  Another unique item at this buffet - they have a chocolate fountain.  Complete with custom made sneeze guard.  You have to stick your fruit, marshmallow, or rice krispies treat through a hole in the plastic to get to the chocolate.  A fun addition to a buffet.  It's over by the crepe station in the second dining area.  Also, on the weekends, if you come after 10:30 am - unlimited champagne and bloody marys are included! I think it is a little more expensive, but worth it!",

    "text": "This buffet was an immediate mistake. The wait was whatever but could have been faster. The food was pretty bad and they didn't have the best selection. They did give us unlimited mimosas but they used most pulp to make them and it wasn't very good. We asked for some without pulp and it was way better! I tried the eggs Benedict and they were cooked totally wrong and I couldn't cut through the biscuit. I also had a slice of pizza that wasn't great but it coulda been worse. The crepe I had was good at first til the whipped cream separated and I was pretty much done at that point anyway. All in all id say, absolutely do not eat here. For the price you can find a way better buffet like the one across the street at the mirage for just a little more! Seriously don't eat here or you'll probably regret it... If you do, make sure to take advantage of the unlimited mimosas!",

    "text": "We got the \"Buffet of Buffets\" thing.  We ended up here for our last dinner because it was right across the street from the show we were going to see (less stress getting there on-time).  We'd already gotten our money's worth out of the pass, so this buffet was \"free\".  We arrived at an ideal time...only one group in line ahead of us.  When we left the line was rather long.  The food was OK. Not great, but not bad.  Surprisingly they had a very limited selection.  Really just the one counter of items (maybe 10 or 15), and then the dessert counter nearby.  Literally only about 1/3rd the size of the Paris buffet, and not even 1/8 the size of the RIo.  No, I'm not exaggerating.  What they did have was pretty ordinary.  The sushi was cooked, not \"fresh\" (i.e. raw).  When compared to other buffets on \"the Strip\", this was pretty weak.  Were we not pressed for time because of the show I would have left and gone somewhere else.    One positive thing was that they have Sierra Mist.  That's the only major soda that is made with real sugar only (i.e. they don't have a high fructose corn syrup version anymore).  I avoid HFCS due to the toxic nature of it, so it was really nice that they had Sierra Mist.   They also had cotton candy.  Cotton Candy??  What, is this the state fair??  That was an odd thing to see there.  If this buffet is convenient (as it was for us), then it's OK I guess.  But you can do a LOT better if you're willing to walk a bit (or grab the shuttle to the Rio).  With the Buffet of Buffets you would do much better to visit other places.  If you don't have that, this place is cheap and not horrible.",

I left my table to get more food (hoping for better offerings than my first try) and they cleared my table - water, utensils, everything- before I got back. Glad I was quick to reclaim my table before they seated others there.  Food - the main appeal of any dining experience has to be the food and it was uniformly disappointing! Limited variety, hot food was cold and tasteless, shrimp were still frozen in an ice ball, bland, blase and disappointing on every level. Even the dessert bar was bad: brown stuff that did not taste like chocolate, unimaginative and boring.  Do yourself a favor and skip this one.",

    "text": "How did I miss reviewing this place for so long?!?  I must be trippin' hard, but I digress.  This buffet is a blessed curse.  There is nothing that truly stands out about the buffet itself outside of sheer volume of choices on the first go around.  Please note that I hate going to a buffet and not having access to filling up my drink myself because I do not like not leaving a tip for the waiter or waitress, but sometimes my cup sits empty for an extended period of time.  Tips should be earned, and not just expected...my personal issue though.  When you are first given the clearance to go inside this eatery, and are escorted to your seat by the hostess, you can't help but to notice the massive amount of food that you pass by on the way to your seat.  Once you are given clearance to eat, and given the information that a waiter will be over to take your drink order later, it is just a good idea to just go around and view everything that is offered.  Depending on the meal, you may have an omelet station or a pasta station or whatever!   Truly, there are a lot of options to choose from that ranges from sushi to sliders to carved this and curried that!  A massive salad bar with many options is located next to boiled shrimp and other seafood stuff.  Move over to the next island and you will see sliders, chicken sandwiches and subway sandwiches cut into palm size.  Move to another island and you have a choice of crepes.  Move to another island and you have a huge variety of sweets that includes cotton candy, fondue machines, many cakes and ice cream just to name some yums.    Truly, there is not stand out taste when it comes to this buffet.  Don't look for anything that will knock your taste buds socks off because that is not what this establishment is about.  This food-ship is strictly about shoveling massive amounts of items that you care to indulge into your pie hole often!  Find something that is good for that moment, and just go with that.  Try a little of each variety and leave full.  Just give them a try.  Make sure to ask about any discounts that are available with the buffet as well, which includes them being part of the eat at 6 buffets as often as you would like for 24 hours.",

This plus a coupon, plus someone's platinum status (=free drink at the buffet) and we decided to stop by this buffet. I've been here before, so I didn't have high expectations. The food was edible, but nothing really stood out in a good or bad way. The service was good.  I couldn't find anything too good for dessert and for some reason the chocolate fountain wasn't assembled (it was weekday lunch). Overall, an ok place to get some food. It I had more time and nothing heavy to carry, it would have been better to add $8 and go to Wicked Spoon!",

The salad bar was a basic salad bar, you could make tacos and nachos which was nice but the only meat option was ground beef. I don't like seafood but my friend loves crab legs, shrimp, sushi etc. She could not eat the crab legs because they tasted wrong, the fried shrimp were okay, she enjoyed the sushi. It seemed like every station was down to the bare minimum- no pizza, three pieces of fried chicken, three tortellinis etc. The desserts were okay but I almost broke a tooth on a cherry pit inside one of their mini pies. I did enjoy the ice cream.  Bottomless alcohol- but I was driving, the soda was well calibrated.    I give the service 5 stars, the waitress was very attentive. One star for the food. I left hungry. I had gone to the Planet Hollywood buffet the previous day and left in pain from overeating. Same price and six times the amount of options.",

    "text": "This was a last minute choice, seeing how most buffets close at 10 and this one was inside our hotel. Would have chosen the Aria instead.   We get there and it is seafood and prime rib night. The staff were pretty on top of things. Drinks are self service minus the alcohol. They have soda, hot drinks, juice, iced tea, and milk.   The crab is not self serve, an employee actually pulls the crab out of the boiling pot of water.  The crab smelled old, a bit too fishy. A lot of the legs had meat that stuck or shrank inside the shell. Which makes me believe, and it may not be True, but that the crab has been defrosted and reheated before.   The sushi was previsouly made and the rice was hard, it made the sushi inedible. The tempura shrimp rolls were made awhile prior, since the crispy outside was detaching from the shrimp and was just a soggy layer between the rice and shrimp.   The fried seafood was old. Hush puppies were overcooked and cold. The onion rings were good. The clam chowder that came out was like warm to cold. It came back out piping hot. I found more crab in it than clams. It was overtly salty.    The Mexican food has been sitting forever and barely anyone ate it. The beans had a dried film of beans on top since they hadn't been touched all evening it seemed like. The rest of the Mexican food look like it had not been touched.    The prime rib was cooked well, a bit salty too. The ham was alright.   The desserts were definately old or recycled from lunch. The berries were soft and dried out looking. The crust on a lot of the desserts were soft when they should have had a slight bite or crisp to them.   The gal making the crepes was super nice. But the filling tasted old- strawberries in syrup or bananas foster.  I would almost prefer fresh cut fruit placed in the crepe with the whip cream and chocolate sauce. I ended up adding the lovely sugar coated sliced almonds to mine. I skipped eating the inside because it was slimy.  For the price and convenience it was ehhhh... I wouldn't come back here if I had a choice.",

I paid $65 for 4 when there were only 3 of us. Upon arriving, I mentioned that I had purchased 4 plates for 3 people to take one back to my hotel and was ignored.  After we got our plates and ate with a ton of leftovers we were expecting to take back (that I paid for), we were denied not only out leftovers, but the 4th plate as well. They also denied reimbursing me the 4th plate. This buffet will charge you for 4 and not allow you to take your leftovers, or any other plates you've bought. Our server even brought the whole buffet's manager to me to confirm we couldn't take food back - even though I paid for i",

Even the view of the beautiful flamingoes didn't help. The service also not the greatest.   The brunch buffet doesn't seem to have any flow or organization. The live cooking stations seemed understaffed. I got in line for an omelet behind four people. My first mistake was getting other food-pancakes and French toast first so they got cold while I was waiting forever.  There was one guy doing it. My omelet was really good. I will say that. Get your omelet first then go for other things.   My next trip I got a crepe and some pastries the woman doing the crepes spread them out on the first crepe thing let that side cook, picked it up by hand and transferred it to the other crepe thing to finish it. Folded it with her hand and flopped it on a plate with her hand. What??? No spatulas... I should mention she was wearing gloves but hello? Cross contamination anyone? Raw batter on her gloves...  I am going to brunch which as we all know is inherently classy...I didn't feel very classy with my mimosa in a plastic cup. Am I at a frat party?     The server was in LaLaLand, she never looked directly at us.   Oh and the pizza was bad. I don't even know why I tried that. I had two desserts one was like a chocolate mousse thing with a metric ton of cinnamon on it. Weird. And I think it was a mango mousse thing. I have never actually wanted to spit a dessert out until this monstrosity hit my taste buds.   One of my dining companions got an omelet it was raw. He took it to the manger and she did right by us she refunded his buffet.  I asked if they were understaffed and she said actually today we are overstaffed.  Well you could have fooled the flamingoes out of me because the amount of time I waited in line at the live cooking stations tells a very different story.  Let's revisit the organization of this buffet.  Salad bar in the center as all buffets do. But from when you walk in this is the way the stations are laid out: bagels, rolls, biscuits, butter, toppings-breakfast meats (bacon, sausage) mashed potatoes, Mac and cheese-made to order breakfast potatoes-made to order omelets-rice, gravy, pancakes, French toast, syrup, biscuits with hollandaise-sandwiches, bread, cold cuts, cheeses-pizza-desserts-cereal and muffins-made to order crepes-Danishes and croissants. There's no rhyme or reason or cohesive flow.   This is the worst buffet ever. The food is mediocre at best.  The manager did do right by us though.  Oh and my booth seat needed to keep being readjusted. It wasn't in right.   Just bad. Just don't.",

There is a nice omelette bar, crepe station, fresh fruits and salads. The bacon looked less than appetizing and sat in a pool of grease. Some items definitely looked more fresh than others...  The brunch buffet includes \"unlimited\" mimosas or bloody Mary's. It took ages for our server to even come over (to be fair she seemed like she had a ginormous section to serve), so we only got a couple mimosas in. However they are very sweet, and when asked if  and we could have more champagne instead of juice in them she said no, despite what other reviewers have mentioned.  The other weird thing is they wouldn't accept BC drivers license as ID, and said we could only use our passports? We thought this was bizarre and have never encountered this before...  All in all wouldn't come back but if you had a groupon it's OK.",

On a busy Saturday night, no lines at 7pm might sound tempting, but after experiencing the quality of the food, it's probably in your best interest to search for food elsewhere.  Almost anything else would be a better option for your $30.    The selection is very limited, and within your choices, even fewer were actually good.   The carving station provided a decent prime rib and my wife said the turkey was not bad.   A korean pork dish over white rice was the only item I considered getting a second serving of.   The asparagus had no flavor.  I spit out the shrimp tacos.   A lot of the clam shells were missing its contents inside.   Salads looks inedible and probably left out all day since there's no one to eat and replace it from the salad station.   The biggest draw for this buffet on the weekend is supposed to be its crab legs.   Sorry, but it's smaller and less flavorful than the Asian buffet down the road.    Finally the dessert section is limited and nothing stood out  to save the meal.   It's a shame.   Service itself was average at best.   Took a few moments to flag servers for refills.  Tables were dirty when we arrived.  We were walked to a booth that was dirty and had to wait for it to be wiped down.   Can't see myself supporting this buffet in the future if it remains in its current state.",

We stopped here for lunch because we had purchased the 24 hour pass where you can eat at any M Life property buffet as many times as you want in that 24 hour period.  I've been to almost every buffet on the strip and this was the worst.    First of all the line to get in took about 30 minutes even though there were only a handful of  people in front of us all because there was one person working and each transaction at the register took at least 5 minutes.  Lots of people in line just walked away.  One hostess walked over to see how big the line was and deemed it unnecessary to open another register.  And when we finally got seated about 75% of the restaurant was empty so I couldn't believe they wouldn't want to move the line along quicker and get people in. Even when we left, the place was still empty and the line was still long and moving slowly.  The food selection is the smallest of any buffet I've been to in my life.  There were honestly about 60% less food options than every other Vegas buffet, and worst of all, there were fruit flies in the salad and dessert bar.  How gross!  The place was just filthy and our server only gave us a drink refill once.  Needless to say, we will never return.",

There was literately a line to get in line.  Since me and my friend were in a hurry to catch a show and had bought the buffet of buffets pass, we wanted to get some food in our tummys before the show started. I remember Flamingo was the closest one that was open.  The lines werent too terrible. Both me and my friend were surprised at all the delicious asian food they had. It was authentic and a lot faster than ordering at a restaurant. Since they had a make your own Pho bar, I mixed all my fav stuff, and used UDON noodles instead of the traditional PHO noodles. It was delicious. Definitely give it a try. Bet you cant get that at ur pho or japanese restaurant!  I didnt really have time or the stomach for the other stuff that night, I've been here before, everything else was decent.  Not the best in vegas, but definitely a good alternative if you dont wanna walk to Paris, Spice, or Rio.",

To quote my boyfriend on this place: \"it was low ass iHop quality food for high ass prices\". I couldn't say anything here was worth making another trip down the buffet line for. The restaurant itself was old and outdated. The presentation of the food was served on steam tables like at a Chinese buffet. The flavor was lacking in ALL the food and desserts. If you get the buffet of buffets pass, I would skip this place. If you're looking to purchase and eat at a single buffet restaurant for your Vegas experience, I would DEFINITELY skip this one. No way would I pay $20+ for a breakfast/brunch/lunch buffet here. Go somewhere else and get better food.",

The rest of the buffet is just a collection of side dishes and standard breakfast fare, nothing special. The lucky charms are always a bonus. At first we tried the Caesars buffet but there is a $30 up charge for the holiday brunch so that will be our noontime destination. It looks pretty good, far more diverse than the Flamingo. The Flamingo had just one lonely ham as the carving station. Bottom line this is not the option with so many better ones right next door.",

For the price that you are paying ($17.99-$18.99 with a Player's card) per person, you would expect a buffet to have everything? Judging what I saw and couldn't finish, I would say that it did. The standards of pancakes, bacon, eggs, sausage on one table, along with an omelette station that usually has long lines. A large salad bar is evident, as well as an additional station that serves crepes and a TON of dessert assortments such as muffins, mousses, doughnuts, cookies, and even ice cream. I even saw a table that had pizza slices on it, for breakfast!   An additional station also served mimosas and Bloody Mary cocktails, which are always good in the morning. The waiting staff was pretty attentive on both of my visits, to include one time where an international couple was trying to scam a server into comping their meal by scraping toast crumbs into their milk. Really, people? The server was professional in solving their \"problem\", yet also called them out on it to where they were embarrassed about it and went about eating their meal.   Aside from laughing my butt off at the wannabe scammers, I enjoyed my time at this buffet on both days that I stopped in. Key point to remember using your Flamingo Player's card to obtain more points every time that you eat here or at any other restaurant venue within the hotel & casino.",

The view of the gardens and flamingos is excellent, the room is bright and cheerful. There is an early bird special from 7-8am that is a more discounted price. We went around 7:30 and there was no wait and all food was freshly put out. The fruit was freshly sliced, made-to-order crepes were yummy, and everything we tried was decent. Now, this isn't the Wynn or Caesar's Palace by any means...but if you want a reasonably priced buffet in a nice relaxing location, try it.",

Such a disappointment of a buffet, definitely ranks in the worst buffets I've been to in Vegas, and I am quite the buffet enthusiast!   To start off, it is extremely outdated and everything looks so dingy and old. The service from our waiter was probably the only good thing about this experience. My family and I went on Prime Rib night, and the prime rib tasted like rubber. There is not much of a selection of food and everything is everywhere !!! The limited food they did have taste like freezer foods, not fresh at all! I'm also pretty sure the pizza was freezer Digornio. Absolutely no order to the food. So if your looking for what they call \"sushi\", it's in between the ice cream machine and the rest of the desserts ... seriously!! And if you want taco meet that looks and probably taste like like cat food, then you can come here :/  Stay away from this place !",

For $20, I think this place was a pretty good value, especially considering the fact that the price included all-you-can-drink mimosas or bloody marys. There are about four or five buffet tables featuring fruit, traditional American breakfast fare, crepes, pastries, and Mexican breakfast options.  As with any buffet, the food was hit and miss, but I thoroughly enjoyed the Mexican offerings.  And if you've got time to kill like we did, getting trashed on free mimosas is pretty sweet.  It's not the fanciest of buffets, but it does have a nice scenic view of the nature preserve.  Oddly, they play club music at 9:30 in the morning.  I found this a little weird at first but once I got my buzz on I was singing along with the music.   Get there before 10:30 for breakfast to avoid a big line.",

Went to line purchased brunch, we were greeted by staff and were not able to accommodate our large group of 12. Which was ok, we sat separate . All was good until the waitress freaked out about our receipt which was on the table last time I walked to get food ( which obviously she saw before we got up to get food )She was saying her manager keeps a close eye and needed  to make sure receipt was correct. Uhhh you would think that was confirmed once you payed. The waitress proceeded to the other part of our party asking for there receipt and they didn't have there receipt either she started to freak out. It was very confusing due to the fact we were in the restaurant eating for 15 to 20 minutes already. Waitress continue to state that her manager was very strict and needed to find theses receipts. Waitress continue to ask me to check my purse once again for the receipt. So we continued to eat with no problems. However I could tell waitress was stressing over receipt. I offered to talk to manager if there was a problem but she refused. Shame on management if they stress out the staff to the point that they cannot perform a good job!!!  Buffet: selection was not that great I am pretty sure there was more of a selection at old country buffet. Food was cold. The one pro was the taquitos had a good chipotle sauce  but were cold.  Desert were prepackaged  products and staff was literally pushing me to the side to place food on  Anyways I rather pay more and get good food than go through this again.",

For $17.99 pp and less for children, you get a thawing snow crab legs, thawing cocktail shrimp and so-so cooked seafood.  The sushi bar, if you want to call it that, consisted of smoked salmon (pretty good)  they keep running out of, california roll and salmon roll.  I think that's it.  There's a ham carving station that turns into the prime rib during lunch.  That was the highlight of my meal and I'm not a meat eater.  I am not much of an omelet eater when I'm out, since I make really good ones at home.    My little cutie pie was so excited about the cotton candy machine, like he needs anymore sugar. I rarely have him eat that crap, but since we're on vacation and the look in his adorable face...well we let him have one.  Hubby liked the crepes as well.  I'm disappointed because we have Pacific Buffet in Arizona for $16.99 dinner that blows this place away.  Don't forget to get your rewards card in the lobby to get 10% off your bill.

The line to the buffet can get pretty long unless you're a Diamond tier level for Total Rewards then you can avoid the long and be seated right away. The decor of the buffet has that 80's Beach Boys vibe because that was the last time the Flamingo had a major renovation. My seat cushion kept falling off every time I went to start a new plate and the flooring needed to be replaced too!  The food is was pretty average and the layout from one station to the other is just horrible and on the far end of the buffet behind the wall was a dessert section and I didn't even know it was there until I wanted to see what the other side of the buffet looked like. They really need to update this buffet to compete with the other buffets and some of the staff are pretty rude and some very friendly, I wouldn't put this buffet on my worst buffet list:   Emperors Buffet - Imperial Palace  (Old and rundown buffet with old tasting food)  Paradise Garden - Buffet (Horrible layout and quality)  Roundtable Buffet - Excalibur (Food is too salty)  More Buffet - Luxor  (Low quality)  Dishes Buffet - Treasure Island (Small and no enough selection)",

You'd save money on energy by not overcooking food and you'd make your customers happy. But Flamingo cannot even do that. They must cook their crab legs and salmon like hard boiled eggs for no reason other than having no cooking skills. Can't you people go to some training and learn how long to cook salmon and crab legs? Why would you want your customers to not come back and yourself be out of jobs? Do you just walk around like zombies not knowing what you're doing there? Don't you understand that food is your business and all you have to do is to not make it so dry that people can't wait it?

A $20 lunch gets you a surly waitress and a limited and tasteless selection of food. Even the desserts were bad. Makes Golden Corral look like a 5 star restaurant. I guess the place had a nice view of the courtyard but I wasn't given a seat near the window.",

    "text": "Two times I've gone here, I've only had their breakfast buffet. Either times, I can't deny the options they have from their option of chicken & waffles and a simple egg, bacon, and hashbrown optioned breakfast. Could be one of the smaller ones but the food they offer is good enough for breakfast. They also have a dessert/fruit section as well as a salad bar with shrimp cocktails as well. Best tip is to come around 10:30am and stay until 11:00am so you get the brunch meal with options of crab legs and prime rib. The food isn't too bad and with the longer waits at other places, you can't go wrong coming here. Though a warning to you is the service is not so great. Not a lot of people working so you can be sure that once you are done with your first dish and back to start eating on your second dish that your first plate is still there at the table. Refills take a while if you don't ask your server. They don't come refill for you if you don't ask. Though the food is decent and there's not much of a wait, the customer service needs to get better here.",

    "text": "I wish that Yelp would let you give stars on specific aspects of the experience and then average a star rating because parts of my Breakfast Buffet experience were decent and parts were terrible.  First the good:  The food, it was good.  Nothing spectacular, but exactly what I expected from a buffet at the Flamingo.  Decent variety, food was fresh.  I had eggs about 300 ways (with chorizo, rancheros, breakfast burrito, benedict) and they were all good.  The shrimp cocktail was the bomb, the chocolate fountain was just kitschy enough to be fun.  I wouldn't complain.  I left full and ate nothing that was disappointing.  The blah: The price.  Right at $50 for 2 Breakfast buffets, food only.  Not worth it.  I can't eat that much for breakfast, and I know how much eggs cost.  Breakfast buffets should never run over $20 bucks unless I can get lobster, and maybe bottomless mimosas.  The bad: The service!   The women working the cash registers were rude.  Our server was incredibly overwhelmed, which was not the real problem.  The problem was the other servers in other areas refusing to step in and help out.  All we needed to drink were waters.  It took us 20 minutes to get water.  I tried to flag down 3 servers outside of our own who was serving tables as fast as she could and I was shrugged of by each although their areas were obviously slower than ours.  That was a major disappointment.  Our server was incredibly polite and apologetic about the wait and once she caught herself up, was very attentive.  But overall there was a lack of team work to keep things flowing and customers happy.  Overall I was happy with the food, but for 25 bucks a head I feel like I can expect decent customer service as well.  That was lacking and I would not go back or recommend this buffet to others because of this.  Sorry Flamingo, you have to do better.",

    "text": "Now I've been to at least 2 dozen Vegas buffets, and consider myself somewhat of a Vegas buffet connoisseur....and this is the first one that has caused me to say \"Wow, that isn't worth anywhere near what I paid!!!\"  At most Vegas buffets, you get more or less what you pay for.  My main area of expertise is the Champagne Brunch, and Vegas has quite the variety.  I've seen everything from the $8.99 Sahara (RIP) that served their champagne in plastic cups from some bizarre powdery mixture, to the Bellagio, which for $25 will get you a good selection of high-quality food and the coldest milk money can buy, to the Wynn, where $45 will get you every bizarre food under the sun (yet somehow omit the one food you crave most at any brunch buffet.....bacon).  Anyways....The Flamingo buffet hits bottom rung in pretty much every category.  Poor selection, poor quality, high price, and to top it off you have to pay $10 extra for champagne (unless you happen to be a diamond Total Rewards member)!  At $25 plus $10 for champagne, you get basically the smallest buffet in Vegas.  They do throw a few crab legs and shrimp in to justify the price, but don't be fooled.  They were well-below-average quality, even for buffet standards.  And the rest of the buffet is no better....I've seen $10 Fremont-strip buffets with twice the selection and better quality!  The wait staff was friendly and attentive, so I have no qualms there.  However, they were balanced off by the surly crepe chef....  I get to the front of the line and ask for my crepe with \"everything\".  She says, \"Everything?\"  I say ,\"Yes, everything,\" and point to each of the toppings (apple, strawberry, chocolate, whipped cream, and nutella).  She gets angry, throws strawberries and chocolate on my crepe, and yells, \"Next!\"  Who does that?  It doesn't cost you anything.  Even if you think the combination is disgusting, just throw the junk on the crepe and the drunk idiot will go away and be happy.  Now you made him sad.  So if you happen to be in the market for a champagne brunch, pass by this one and don't look back.  There are plenty more that are well worth your while....TI, Paris, Aria, Planet Hollywood...just to name a few.",

We always stay at the Flamingo while in Vegas (love it!), and end up eating here on the day we're checking out.  The environment is really sunny and nice with all the windows and the water/birds and stuff outside.. Really kind of cute.  The food is just pretty average for breakfast, nothing particularly stellar, but there's a pretty good amount of variety.  I must admit that I did sneak a little bag of cotton candy to eat a little later, mueheheh.  But hey what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas, right?  Had it not been in our hotel, we probably wouldn't have made a special trip, but for anyone staying there, it's okay, especially considering that the price is a little lower than other buffets around.",

Starting from the rude cashiers all the way to management. Don't forget to tip before the horrible service, or they will rain fire on your table. God forbid, you leave a tip at the end of your meal where you serve yourself. Not only did our \"server\" slam our drinks down and ignore us the whole time, except to give our whole table an evil stare down, but she refused to give us refills on our inclusive champagne brunch. She even said we couldn't get refills on our iced teas, oj's, or sodas.... I thought this was a buffet. Luckily she brought the manager over and they had an argument about refills in front of us because our server wanted us to \"see it.\" Whatever that means. When we asked her if something was wrong, she went on a rant about how only god can judge her and then things turned from bad to worse. I guess that God justifies bad service, rudeness, and denies us new silverware. But in a turn of fate, after being open about our concerns, she gave our table all of her attention before leaving in the middle of our meal. After she left, our new server didn't even look at our table, introduce herself, clear off plates, or anything that has to Do with good service. But we tracked her down on the other side of the restaurant and got some refills. I would like to think that maybe they just hate us, but we were not the only ones who were yelled at or ignored. Clearly customer service is not a priority. The management here obviously  doesn't want people coming back, seeing as how rude they were. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone who is looking for an easy going meal. But the food is good... So I guess that counts for something. Maybe.",

Their food are just bland and so limited in selections.  My guests and I would walk round and round and still have an empty plate.  There's really nothing good.  When I leave, they would hand me a slip to fill out for survey.  I would fill it out with the good service, but lousy food and selection hoping it will change next time around.  It never did; hence, the 1 star review.  Hope they act up and get some really good chef in here and put out more selection of food instead of leaving the middle with desserts only.    The buffet is divided into three sections with the middle being dessert and the front and the last section serving the same type of food.  They should move the dessert section to the end and merge the front and middle section and open up more stations with better selections like Asian menu.",

Well, while we were standing in line, there was a big menu-esque thing describing all the different stations they had, and it sort of got me excited. I planned on filling up on sushi and sea food. So we get in, and the buffet is literally about ten feet long, that's it. Each station consisted of one food item. Sure I was happy to see the big mound of shrimp and crab legs, but it ended up grossing me out instead. How long have they been sitting out, exactly? I don't know, but the shrimp still had the shell on them, and, it was a little fishy. Fishy seafood is a no-no.  I didn't even enjoy the desert buffet. Although I had two dinner rolls, that's pretty much what I filled up on. But you can't really screw up dinner rolls, can you? (knock on wood)  I don't plan on going back, or even recommend anyone else going there.   But I did see Donnie Osmond in person! Not that I had anything to say to the guy, I mean, exactly what is he famous for? Anyway, I would've hoped he'd have better taste in food than the buffet at Flamingo...",

    "text": "This place was really not up to par and should not be in existence in Las Vegas.  Compared to the other buffets around Las Vegas, Flamingo fails for dinner buffet.    THE GOOD:   1. They have cold shrimp and crab legs.      2. The mashed potatoes are very tasty!  3. They had a Crepe station!  The fruit filling is not fresh.  It's jam.    THE BAD:   1. A place like this has cold shrimp and crab legs!!???  Not too bad, but it just did not look as fresh as at Bellagio.     2. Dessert bar consists only of cookies, cake slices, iced cream (not         really ice cream).  Where's the creme brulee???  3. Very soggy vegetables.   4. No strawberries nor pineapple in the fruit section.    I would definitely spend my money elsewhere, even if I have to wait in line longer and pay a little more.  (*Hint* Think Bellagio)",

    "text": "Tooling around Vegas late at night one is left with the conundrum...do I want to spend $40/50/person+ and expect great food (being disappointed with anything less), or do I spend less and take a major roll of the dice that my dinner might be better fit for a dog?  Deciding that at least if a buffet isn't that great, you can still really fill up, we found ourselves on line for a couple minutes before entering this buffet at the Flamingo.  Selection was decent, but hardly huge, and even the dessert area, while taking up a lot of space, didn't really have that much variety to offer.  Do we really need 25 feet of \"sugar-free desserts\"?  The drink service was annoying to say the least, as the soda hardly tasted right, and the servers rarely paid you any attention.  Why no open area to get your own drinks?  The food itself ranged from marginal at best (lobster bisque, pasta) to forgettable but decent (poultry dishes, other seafood) to fairly good (green beans, fried rice, beef dishes).  The desserts were hit and miss as well.  In the end, for $25 a person, this was right on the edge of tolerable.  One could fill up on pretty decent food, and that was the saving grace.  However, I'm sure it far from the best buffet or best deal available on the strip.  It was essentially the hand we were dealt, and at least we didn't lose our shirts.",

When we were finally let in, we saw that despite the huge line outside, there were plenty of unoccupied tables that were simply waiting to be cleared/bussed. The messy tables were filled with dirty plates, dirty glasses, napkins, etc. Maybe they were short on waitstaff (it was during the week of Christmas), but It definitely detracted from the atmosphere.   They have crab legs, shrimp, mussels on ice. Those seemed to be a big hit, though I personally don't love raw seafood. They also have an extensive salad bar -- it's not a whole foods salad bar, but it has all the basic salad fixins and some premade salads. It was a pretty average salad bar. The sushi area was poor: they had a cucumber-seaweed salad, some california rolls, and a tuna roll. The hot foods area had something for everyone, but nothing was superb. A lot of dishes erred on the sweet side (roasted winter vegetables, prime rib, some fish dish), which I found annoying.   Desserts include bread pudding, blueberry crisp, made-to-order crepes, and lots of cakes. They also had some sugarfree options!  I left feeling full and happy. We had 5$ off coupons, so the buffet was $19.99.  For the price, the food was okay: nothing superb, nothing awful.",

Our waitress was attentive at continually refilling the champagne glasses and they were handing out mini bottles of vodka to make your own bloody mary.

I'm tired and I want breakfast at noon! Got in 10 min before 11 scrambling to fill up multiple plates before all the breakfast items disappear.  syrup gone arrgh! At least the guy cooking the omelets was fast and very nice. If I had cash on my I would have tipped. I wish I could have transferred our tip from our crappy waitress to him. She was horrible. Two tables down those people in that section were having fun because of the cool waitress they had. More to piss me off. The lunch items that were brought out were foul so that wasn't an option. At least I got 4 plates filled before I missed out on breakfast.   Very not impressed.",

Tell him what you want & it gets made, not like a lot of people who ask you each thing because they weren't paying attention the first time.

They do offer a great variety of options, but not as much as some other buffets. The quality is a bit inconsistent - sometimes the food is amazing and cooked just right, and sometimes it is dry and over cooked and not that palatable - hence the reason for only 3 stars. Otherwise, when the food is good, it is on point; just a bit hit or miss there. Also love that they serve tacos and nachos and all the fixings during their breakfast hours - no shame in early morning tacos after a night of drinking.   The views of this buffet are definitely what makes this place. It overlooks the Flamingo hotels flamingo enclosure complete with, you guessed it, real flamingoes (as well as other interesting species of birds).  There are some waterfalls and greenery mixed in, and coupled with the huge floor to ceiling windows, it really sets a nice atmosphere for the restaurant. Otherwise the rest of the place is mediocre in terms of decor, nothing high end, just plain and casual.",

The food has definitely improved since our first visit, long before my Yelping years. This time, I had a crepe with strawberries and chocolate and whipped cream and it was super-decadent as expected. The lunch items looked good, but I forwent. I had mostly breakfast, which was all just great, and washed down nicely with the bottomless carafes of mimosa!!!

Amazing how few places were actually open at this time.  Atmosphere - Outdated.  Plain and simple this place needs an overhaul.  The food was easy to get to, so that was a good thing.   Food   Drinks - The weekend \"brunch\" comes with bottomless mimosas or Bloody Mary's.  I had the Bloody Mary's.  Served in a small cheap plastic cup filled to the top with ice, maybe an 8 ounce cup.  No garnishes.  I could not feel the alcohol in my drink.  My wife did say her mimosas was heavy on the booze.  I also had black coffee.  Both were left empty during most of the meal.    \"Brunch\" - This was my breakfast for the day, well it later turned into lunch too.  So it was really brunch.  That was not my plan.  Not a single item stood out for me.  As my father in law said the pastries are cold like they just took them out of the freezer, which I agree with.  I was really wanted the pastries to be good.  The French toast was soggy and bland.  The gravy for the biscuits was bland with no sausage in it.  I was able to pull a couple of slices of bacon from the heap of molded bacon slab.  I wish I would have gotten a picture of that heap of a mess.  The sausage links they had were large and in a casings, again bland.  They did have a carving station but nothing caught my eye.  They do a have a cereal station, perhaps that is for the little kids that a picky eaters.    Service - Slow.  Thanks for the free meal for my father in law on veteran's day.  He served in the US Air Force proudly!   Future - I hope not.",

Wynn had such a GREAT buffet that Paradise couldn't compete. I wanted to be wowed & delighted but this is just mass produced food.",

Eat here if you love basic mass produced food prepared without any Love  I paid $25 bucks for plates of defrosted Chinese chicken,Bland salad bar,Nasty meats and a poor desert bar. I would fire the head chef immediately!! Sorry but it's True !! I wonder if this is he same buffet that came out in the movie \"Vegas Vacation\" ? Oh and the worst part is the place was empty and they kept a long line outside for no reason!!! It made it seem like people were clamoring to get in.... wrong !!! They do that for appearances only",

When you hear your friends rave about how great the Vegas buffets are and how \"there are so many great ones to choose from\", they will never be referring to this one.  The buffet is average, at best, with nothing really original or unique that left me wanting more. On that same note - food doesn't have to be original or unique, just really good, which this food failed to be. Of the number of items ranging from breakfast to seafood to sushi to salad to dessert, the dish that rose to the top for me was probably the Salmon with Dijon Dill sauce. The fish was well-prepared, delicate in texture and had a nice balance of flavors.  The food was tolerable, but the bigger issue is that the service was way below average for any dining experience. Drink refills were nonexistent and attention to our table was equally nonexistent... which took disregard to a whole new level because I was at a table with 6 other guys. It took around 10 minutes just to get the server's attention to get one refill of iced tea. Just unacceptable.  Overall, the food needs improvement and the service needs a big face-lift. Nothing about this place makes me want to plan a return visit. It's not the worst buffet I've been to, but it's faaaar from good.",

The food selection was very good - great selection of hot and cold breakfast and lunch items. Boyfriend loved the omelet station.

I'm not sure if everything had been sitting out for a long time but my food was at room temperature (a big peeve for me). The breads were stale. I only rate this 2 stars due to decent desserts and salad bar. Our waitress and hostess were fabulous but other than that this place needs some improvement foodwise.

The one thing I love about coming here is eating their salad bar with all the fixings and the crawfish.  The crawfish are on the cold bar next to the shrimp and crab. I bring a few plates over to the kitchen crew and they drop them in a hot pot of boiling water to get them just the way I like em, nice and hot. The prime rib is very tender. They do have dessert crepes, but they are pre-made and are not fresh like the Paris buffet. The chocolate fountain is great for dipping your fresh fruit, brownie pieces and marshmallows.  They also make cotton candy for the dinner time crowd.  Overall, the buffet here is very basic and simple and try do a great job for what it is. If you want something top notch, visit Caesar's Palace buffet, (The Bacchanal).",

Atmosphere: Think early 90's decor with a view.

They pretty much rinse and repeat their desert, so the selection isn't as large as it looks.   They have really vague labels on some of their food. (I.e pizza, fish, no-sugar)  I guess you can say the view is nice if you get a seat next to the window, drinks are unlimited.  Obviously overpriced at $30 a person.",

Wish we took the 20 minutes to find another place...  Their sign said that their lunch buffet ends at 3pm and at 3:01pm the lady behind the desk gave us the lunch price. Kudos. Walking to our table I immediately noticed a Vegas hotel style restaurant with appealing outside views of a small walkway and a pretty water fountain. Cool. And then it goes downhill...  The only thing that was really good from this buffet were the crab legs. I had a fair share of them but they didn't have an crab leg crackers --- just a small utensil to pick out your crab meat. My task to stuff my face was very difficult. There was a small section open for sushi but the sushi there appeared to have been out for a few hours. All the cooked food appeared and tasted overcooked. They had a build your own nachos section but no chips. I was hoping that I would get at least something decent from the dessert aisle but the cookies were rock hard!  I suppose if you were to come here you should come during peak hours since food is always being shuffled. Looks like we were in the middle of a shift change or menu change from lunch to dinner. This is Las Vegas --- the world's number one tourist attraction. Step it up.",

I purchased a Groupon which gave our group the ability to skip the long line to get in and also save $5.00 on the buffet price. There was a nice salad and fruit bar with 2 soup options. The entrees were good as well. The tacos were very good and I enjoyed lots of the side dishes. I am a seafood lover so the peel and eat shrimp were good and there were piles of crab legs. I enjoy the hot steamed crab legs which were a bit over cooked but just like any buffet when the crab legs sit out a long time they dry up. Our server wasn't the best but we were able to work around that. The unlimited drinks both alcoholic and non alcoholic were also a plus. The scenery was nice but it started getting dark while we were there so we didn't get to enjoy it as much as I would have liked. Desserts were good and they had my fav soft serve ice cream. I would go back again!",

    "text": "Seriously, out of all the Buffet of Buffet's, only Flamingo & Rio get 5-stars.  Maybe PH (Planet Hollywood), but last time they didn't have a line for Platinum/Diamond members [which means waiting in that extravagant line], so that might keep them at a 4-star rating.  But let's focus on the task at hand.  And keep it simple.  You're probably reading this on your iPhone hoping to find a quick tip before you go out & get trashed & bet a black on zero's.  Location:  back of Flamingo.  Still trying to figure out the parking structure that's right outside the doors of it, but can't navigate it.  Either way, not too far into the casino (unlike Caesar's) that you and you drunk buddies can easily find your way to it.  Ambiance inside is still a little dated, but you can ask for a view next to the windows which circle around the flamingo gardens and koi ponds.  Once watched a turtle couple hook up while sun bathing.  Not too shabby.  Service:  Awesome.  Playing has it perks, and that includes getting upgrade to Platinum/Diamond level.  Those have its perks, like not waiting in line.  Plus the servers tend to treat you better hoping to squeeze out an extra few bucks hoping that you're really rolling like your card 'says' you are.  Luckily for me, \"na aawa ako sa mga kababayan\" so everytime I get a Filipino server, there's always a guaranteed extra few bucks.  Parking:  It's inside the hotel, so valet or self, your choice.  Walk to take the monorail as well.  Food:  Honestly, I love the breakfast here.  The BF loves the Chinese & he and my dad killed it during our most recent New Years trip here, so although I can't say personally, they clearly enjoyed.  They have some basic dimsum items, xio mai & sticky rice, chicken feet (and please, don't get grossed out, our at least not out loud.  To be more clear, don't be the girl this weekend that walked past it and yelled out as loud as she could, \"EWWW GROSSS CHIIIIIICKEN FEEET\" - seriously, have some respect).  Widest variety I've seen where ALL the food tastes good.  Plus, cotton candy!  You can get crepes made and there's a carving station.  Crabs & mussels always taste fresh.  No reason for you to not give this a shot!  Overall:  No complaints.  Members get treated well and at least it's not in a super-overpriced casino so I don't regret playing some money after I get out.  And this one is definitely more kid-friendly than some of the other buffets/hotels.  Also, located in the middle of the strip, so you're definitely not walking the Daytona 500 back to your hotel if you ran out of money for the taxi.  Happy Eating!",

Every July David and I make our trip up to Vegas for a show or two, a little gambling, shopping and of course some food! We came upon this place in 09 after receiving a coupon and decided to try it out. We went for the Champagne brunch, not bad for the price. About $20 pp. (reg brunch no coupon is about $36 for 2) They had everything I personally could ask for. Salad bar, biscuits & gravy, crab, prawns, stainless steel warming trays with poultry, beef and fish with someone to serve you in there little white coats and chef hats on the other side of the buffet table. THEEE best part is they served fresh crepes made right before your eyes!!! My fav!!! I had a fresh crepe with strawberries, whip cream and a Little syrup. Yeeeeeeeum! Then, once you have filled your plate full of goodies and get back to your modest table to dig in, you will find yourself surrounded by wall to wall windows facing beautiful landscaping with a equally as beautiful waterfall in the middle of it all. Your waitress is pleasant and always there for that refill, even with the champagne. We came back again this passed July and nothing's changed, still very pleased. As far as buffets go, this is one of my favorites and you can't beat the view!",

We only went here because those timeshare people gave us 2-for-1 coupons. There isn't much of a crowd there, either, as people recognize it is crap.  They hide the buffet section - you have to walk further to the back to see it. Some people miss it completely. Save yourself $15-20 and just go eat some stuff off the dollar menu at McDonalds nearby. I'm serious.",

While the hotel itself leaves MUCH to be desired, I'm REALLY glad we took a chance with their buffet. It was my Aunt's birthday & I have absolutely no regret for taking her & her 4 sisters here that day. For least than $20 these women had a blast! Everyone found something to please their palate, the variety was endless, endless cocktails were included & their dessert section & fresh crepe station sealed the deal! Everything tasted fresh, not generic at all, the ambience was pleasant, not noisy or congested, just right! Not to mention a great bang for your buck. I would definitely go back here to dine & totally recommend it to anyone, especially after trying several other buffets at many other high end & newer hotels in Vegas. Keep up the good work!",

You get a view of the flamingos from inside the dining area (their habitat is outside where there are also a variety of geese, ducks and a decent size koi fish pond). The service was great, our waitress was friendly and great with checking that our glasses were always full and cleaned up our finished plates frequently. The omelet chef was also hilarious (he really wanted to make me some). The overall taste and quality of the buffet selection I feel were better than what this place is being given, I'd recommend it. Another thing to note, when we went on our Grand Canyon tour bus ride, our guide gave specific facts as well as suggestions to what each casino was good or known for and she said that flamingo had the best buffet. Who knows, maybe she was being biased but we enjoyed it here. Another thing to note, the cashier was nice and pointed out if we had a rewards card that there was a discount which is pretty awesome and that came up to about $22 per person.",

We had waited at least 10 minutes while the two cashiers figured out some problem with another guest. As I was being scolded, another couple walked up in line. The gal told me I had to stand in line like everyone else. What a joke. We should have left then. The couple who just got in line behind us where nice enough to explain to the cashier that we were there first. The food is horrible!!! Service is just as stale as the food. Not as much as a crack of smile from our Ms. Sunshine. NO WONDER NO ONE WAS IN LINE- THE PLATINUM LINE OR THE PEON LINE!",

The line to get in wasn't bad at all an we got on pretty quick.    The servers are super nice. They gave us an extra plate for our crab shells, bones, and ect. My fiance ask for hot sauce and she got 4 different ones which was cool. My drinks got refilled fast.   For the food that I would say was okay but got me full which was point. Everything tasted decent and nothing really wowed me which I didn't expect since it a buffett. What I didn't like was there steak was almost cooked on the outside and almost rare( bloody ) on the inside.  All the other foods I eaten I have no complains about.   I didn't see all the desert til the end which was on the other far comer of the place. I got me a crepe that's tasted okay.

The legs are smaller now as well. I guess that explains why the price went down to 19.99 from 24.99. It's still a decent buffet to go to for seafood lovers, but I'd recommend the Village Seafood Buffet at the Rio if you want to eat some serious seafood.   Service is great and fast, and desert bar is awesome.",

Well sorry, we didn't really have a chance to ask since you rushed away from our table all the time. When the drinks arrived, she slammed them down on the table and left without saying a word. The rest of our visit was full of passive aggressive attitude towards us. The mimosas were also served in plastic cups with ice cubes and didn't taste at all like they contained champagne. The food was lack luster at best, and left a lot to be desired. If I wanted a rude waitress, I would have gone to Dicks Last Resort, not a \"family-friendly\" buffet like Paradise Garden Buffet. Good luck if you end up with Julie as a server on your visit.",

Unless it's the way that they are cooking the crab or overcooking it. The prime rib was flavorless.The sushi rolls were like day old grocery store sushi.The best thing on the buffet was the dim sum style steamed shrimp in rice paper.

I've been to other Casino buffets and never seen any Buffet this horrible. They really need to get new cooks and better food purveyors.

    "text": "For a buffet this place is great. Everyone is warm and friendly. The lines are very long at breakfast but if you arrive for an off peak dinner you will be guaranteed a table very quickly and you can dine without hassle. The price is worth it for the crab legs alone. If you saw some crazy crab leg obsessed lady that was just cracking crabs like a machine and creating herself a lovely plate of succulent crab meat... *waves* that was me! That was my main objective for coming to this spot. I am a seafood addict. I seriously od'ed on the crab legs and no one not even the employees or my waiter judged me at all or gave me any dirty looks. In fact the waiter was very accomodating. He kept taking my shell plates away and bringing me more butter. Dear waiter, you sure know how to keep this lady happy. After I had sufficiently filled up on crab I had a small sample of some of the other buffet offerings to get a good idea of what's good here. Everything else was pretty average. Not amazing but definitely not bad and certainly edible. Best of all this place was right in the lobby of the hotel where I was staying so it was pretty convenient. Not only that but if you use your total rewards card to gamble you can use your points to get a free lunch or dinner voucher. That's right I had all that crab for FREE! Awesome huh? Be warned... I will be back in February so keep those crab legs stocked up for me :)",

More seafood choices would be nice, but I still enjoyed what was there.  Free beer and wine.   Good dessert selection with custom crepes as an option. Service was pretty good.",

Overall it was a very nice experience, my fiance had never been to a breakfast buffet and I thought she was going to explode! She was so overwhelmed with all the good food they have here.  I really like the custom omelet station, that was delicious. The country fried steak and bacon was also very good. Its nice they have other things other than breakfast food like chicken and pizza that was good.  I had some ice cream for dessert that was pretty standard but it looked like they had some other treats that I would like to try next time. Can't wait to go back!",

That being said, PG does offer fewer options than nearby buffets. At the time of my visit, they were offering the usual fruit/salad station, a basic breakfast staples area with chefs preparing omelets as requested, a Chinese kitchen next to some questionable sushi, pasta and the commonplace hot ham area. You would think such a small place would also skimp out on the quality of food they serve but they were offering lobster mac and cheese which I wasn't expecting but certainly didn't mind eating.   My main motivation for coming wasn't the food but the bottomless mimosas. They were served via premixed pitchers but still had a good juice to champagne ratio, not strong but definitely not watered down. Table service was a bit slow but the servers were quick with refills once you actually got their attention.",

We get there on a Saturday around 11:30, the line was crazy long and it sounds like everyone had the same amazing Groupon. We waited in line for about 30-40 min, but the dining area wasn't crowded. I asked for a table by the window because that was another reason I wanted to eat here for the great view.  I hit the omelette line first. There were 2 people in front of me. The first person ordered 2 omelette, the next 1 and then he took my order. So he had 4 omelettes going, and I don't know what happened but he started getting confused about who's omelette was who's. He gave the first person 1of hers then the next person he gave her the first persons other omelette, then he tried giving me someone else's but I told him which one was mine, so he gave me mine but the first person was still standing there waiting for her other omelette but he gave it away. Lol it started to get a little comical. My next stop was the fresh made crapes. They had chocolate, strawberry, and banana. The food was pretty good and fresh for a buffet. They also had a carving station, I'm not sure exactly what they were carving I didn't stop there.  The reason I gave 3 stars is because it didn't have a lot of options. I think this buffet is one of the smaller ones on the strip. The unlimited mimosas come in a little plastic cup and they come around with a pitcher and refill it.  The views are amazing, it opens up to the Flamingo garden.",

Anyway, I didn't see any flamingos cause we were facing the food. The food was OK but it was breakfast/brunch when we arrived so there was runny eggs, bacon, sausage, etc. They had a really extensive salad bar, like 3 Chinese dishes, taco/nacho bar, and the other side had a poor spread of fruit and deserts. Other Vegas buffets are worth going to - unfortunately, I don't think we'd come back here unless we had a Groupon or a comp for a free buffet.",

But the food was nothing special, those working seemed overly annoyed and the booth we were sat at was straight outta 1992. The cushion was so worn out, we sunk way below the table. If you're looking for cheap food, nothing special,  this is your place! Only cool thing about this buffet were the flamingos outside of it.",

But it was uncalled for, we had a very nice time and I totally recommend it.  The view of the live flamingos outside the window is pretty neat and the food was satisfying.  I could nearly have been rolled out of there, which is a win in my book.  The line to get in looked pretty long when we got there but it moved quickly and in no time we were stuffing our faces.  Don't expect this place to be somewhere over the top and I feel like your expectations will be easy for it to meet.",

The Asian bar had excellent variety - sushi, soups, noodles (vermicelli, pho). Even a create your own soup bowl bar (gather ingredients and hand to staff to add hot water). Dim sum items - pot stickers, shrimp balls - were readily available.  Shrimp was already peeled and cocktail sauce readily available.  Lamb was pretty good in the middle. If you get an end piece, it is possible that it may be too hard or burnt.  Lots of desserts - cookies, sugar free cookies, crepes, pies, chocolate fondu fountain with marshmallows.  Liked the fact that all hot items on counter were in individual pots to keep them warm. Sadly, most patrons didn't understand to leave the spoon on the plate and close the lids when done.  Slow service from staff. At this location, servers have too many tables to adequately maintain a decent level of service.  Would much prefer this for lunch than dinner.",

Overall, I love this place! Out of all the buffets I ate at (not including Harrah's because I didn't get the chance to eat there..) I think this place had the most food, and it was also roomy too. Very spacious, lots of place s to sit and wasn't too crowded when I went. The first time I went, there was a very long line..but several minutes later, one of the hosts moved my me and my fam up to a different line and were served right away, because had the 24 hour buffet bracelet on. Woohoo!  My only complaint about this place is that sometimes, they are slow to get your drink orders.  I was also enjoyed by the fact that they have cotton candy as one of their desserts, haha. I didn't get it..but it was fun to see. It was a first for me. I also liked the chocolate fountain they had where you can dip strawberries, marshmallows, etc.  They also had a ton of desserts. Coming from a health freak family, I like the fact that they are sugar-free as well.  I am definitely coming back to this place!",

I couldn't tell what was what in the trays and hot holds. Seriously the labels were either gone or wrong.   The salds were ok, but the veggies and sides for choosing did not look to fresh. The meats were stale and flavorless. The chinese food selection was gross.   The only reason I gave this buffet two stars is because the hostess gave us free extra sky vodka mini bottles and the dessert selection was very good. But then again, how can you mess up cakes, ice cream and chocolate??? I especially liked the crepe station where they make it to your order and right in front of you.",

This place desparately needs an overhaul like the slot machines they had right out the door.  They need to close for one more reason, to clean the carpets.

They had shrimp, crab legs, \"asian\" food like all buffets do, fried food, baked fish, salmon, all kinds of stuff that wasn't too bad, but I'd have to agree with another yelper who said that the food was all lukewarm and not necessarily hot or cold.  I didn't eat too much because since we were doing a turnaround I didn't want to eat and then having the itis driving home.  The food I had was just ok, though.  The crab legs were bottom of the barrel, weren't very fresh, they had made slits in the shells so they could be opened easier, but even when they were broken at the slits the meat stuck to the shells so it was hard to get it all out without completely cracking the legs open lengthwise (yah, I'm kind of a crab leg pro hahaha).  The desserts were ok, nothing to complain about after a long day on my feet.  The only thing that was slightly annoying was the fact that they sat our large group in the back but had ample seating everywhere else.  Other than that, the man who was serving us our drinks was great and quick, missed a few people which was understandable because there were so many in our party.  Overall our experience was nice, the food was decent and didn't disgust me like the MGM buffet did, and the staff was great.",

My whole party got sick, and we all spent night and morning in the bathroom in our hotel.   I think this buffet should be shut down!!!

On my recent visit to Las Vegas, I was too tired to seek out a nice dinner, so I stopped in at the Flamingo's buffet. The chief factor recommending it was its location right by the elevator to my hotel room, and no line. I figured at least I could make myself a healthy salad.  Turns out everything in the buffet is so unappealing there is no temptation to overeat.  The quality is comparable to elementary school cafeterias, although the selection is much broader. I ate until the hunger pangs went away, and left, diet intact. Even if you get a comped meal here, you really might want to consider paying for a nice meal somewhere else.",

We went to the Paradise Garden Buffet despite the so-so reviews because:  A. It was in our hotel, and... B. We had a coupon for $10 off of two meals.  We ended up going for the \"champagne and bloody mary brunch\" on Saturday morning, and though I didn't partake of the bloody marys I did consume what was probably more champagne than a single person should ever have before noon.    The food was very average on the whole, but we really enjoyed the fresh crepe-making station - the place gets extra points for that.  Also, I could see flamingos from my seat... once again, nice touch.  Also, when we walked in with our receipt and meal ticket we honestly weren't sure which was which, so when my boyfriend asked the awesome lady at the hostess station about it she replied \"The LONG one is mine *eyebrow raise, all sultry like*,\" and it cracked me the hell up.  Would I go back without a coupon?  Probably not.  But if you happen to be staying at the Flamingo, you're hungry, and you're not quite ready to face the light of day, this isn't a bad place to get some breakfast.",

Part of that is because Gloria is the best waitress ever. She filled my glass of Orange Juice, I chugged it (needing the fluids) and she turned right around and filled it up again! That's great customer service if I ever saw it.   When we checked in to the Flamingo we got a coupon book that gave two people $5 off of the buffet. That was a sign from above because there were 2 of us! Normally I guess the breakfast buffet is $14.99 but we got it for $10. No champagne in this one, but it being our last day, I could live with that.   If you've read any of my other reviews you'll know that I know my way around a breakfast, and this place did too! Bagels with smoked salmon lox and cream cheese, amazing french toast and waffles, a crepe station (ask for banana, they have it!), an omelet station (that will blow your mind! I'll get to that later) and bacon, sausage, an amazing amount of good fruit and everything else.   It was all to die for. Literally, the best omelet I've ever had, the ingredient were fresh and perfect. The crepe was huge and with just bananas and sugar the perfect amount of sweet. The fruit was better then any we had had so far and even the toast was so good I was eating it dry while waiting for them to make my omelet.   We were there during the lunch switch and I saw some people eating ribs, and I would have grabbed some if I thought I could get on a plane with that much food in my stomach.   This buffet is worth coming to even if you're not at the Flamingo. So fantastic. Maybe the best meal we had in the whole vacation!",

    "text": "I'm a big fan of buffets.  But this buffet definitely had that \"old hotel\" feel, and the food was just OK.  The food was similar quality to Old Country Buffet (not to put OCB down, but at least their price is on point with the quality of their food!)  Just having arrived from our morning flight, we were practically starving when we got to the hotel.  After checking in, we immediately went downstairs to the buffet.  Luckily we used our resort credit of $30 that we got when we booked the room, because for free, the food was fine.  We went here around 11ish am, so they were transitioning between breakfast and lunch.    PROS:  I have to disagree with the reviewers that said they had no fruit selection or a good dessert area - since they had both!  They had a nice selection of fresh fruit, and the dessert area was nice!  They had little slices of different cakes and tarts (my fav!) - and they even had a crepes station.  Their bread pudding was delicious, although I've had better elsewhere.  I ate two servings!  :)  They also had a nice selection of cheese, and BBQ ribs were good.  This was the prime location to watch the flamingos from inside, too.  CONS:  It was I think $16 per person, which for the quality of the food it should have been closer to $9.99.  I didn't touch anything on the salad bar, it all looked old and unappetizing.  Even the person sitting next to us we overheard saying the same thing.  I did manage to get some mixed corn from there but it had no flavor.  They also had ceviche, which was questionable since I wasn't sure how long it had been sitting out, but tasted ok and I didn't get sick from it!     In conclusion, this place was ok for free, and for starving people.  Otherwise, there are way better buffets in Vegas than this just a few minutes walk away!",

Free mimosas but the lady only came by once after intially taking our drink orders.

    "text": "Paradise Found and Lost. The brunch buffet was buff with choices, and/et the food quality was good, not great but decently good, for the very most part. The view of the garden was nice. The entrance line moved along fairly quickly. The group buying price was an inducement to give the buffet a try, and it was surely a very reasonable cost. That helped to upgrade my stars to four from three, particularly considering the discounted price. My only disappointments were to do with the service (two stars). Firstly, unlike other group buying buffet deals, we were charged tax. . . . There also seemed to be a paucity of staff. The beverages were self serve, which was fine, but the so called free \"bottomless\" mimosas or Bloody Mary's', included in the deal, were certainly not conspicuous. The removal of used plates was very sporadic, and tables often remained uncleaned for some time. This was less to do with the staff being non-conscientious and seemingly more to do with the limited amount of staff, given the demands at hand. Another example was when I was lining up for a crepe, the attendant suddenly without warning stated that she had to go on her break and someone would replace her (no indication exactly when). The replacement arrived about eight minutes later, when I and two others had already given up waiting. The omelette cook was speedy, and the dollar tip for the tip bowl was deserving. Although his buoyancy and amiability was like a flat balloon. The staff should be given special acknowledgments and photos displays, as well as \"extra\" appreciations for supplementary friendly and industrious service. One could tell that they were likely underappreciated. They were lacking the upbeat qualities that reflect good spirits -- and this likely also reflected in even the basic tips that they might receive. The host was the only one with a little smile. Not paradise for staff, it appears.",

Secondly, the quality of the food is below average, the crab is very dry and over cooked, the fruits, I.e. watermelon and cantaloupe was not ripe, the desserts had a limited selection. I expect the casino would have some kind of chef would would QA the quality of the food being served. It had very bad representation of the casino to serve such low standard food. The only positive experience is the server, we did not get a name but she was from El Salvador and provided excellent service and was kind and friendly. This was my first and last time eating here, definitely not worth $32 dollars per person.",

Unfortunately, we paid the price for that in more ways than one.  First, the cost - $25 per person.  Fairly standard, until you realize that they have seating for at least 400 people in the restaurant, which is usually half-filled, and only have one person pouring champagne, one person making omelettes, and then only one place to get hot food like eggs and bacon.  So what happens when the place gets full, is that you wait sometimes up to 10 MINUTES IN LINE to get a spoonful of eggs, or a couple pieces of bacon!  Want a refill on champagne? Gotta wait 5 minutes! Clearly the funding for this buffet has been sharply reduced, or it never had much at all.  Additionally, we decided to sit by the window next to what looked like a nice pond from a distance.  But when we sat down, it looked like the pond hadn't been cleaned in a very long time and there was a dead turtle floating in it!!!  If you are reading this - heed my advice and give this place a miss!  You would be better off going to a Denny's or even McDonald's for that matter!  There is certainly no value here.",

    "text": "The Paradise Garden buffet is a decent mid-quality, mid-price buffet. Pretty standard fare in a no-frills environment (but there is a nice window onto the bird habitat courtyard)  My wife and I went twice, once for dinner, once for a champagne brunch. It's on the lower price-range of Strip casino buffets, and the quality matches. That's not to say it's bad, it's just not exactly fancy.  For dinner, most of everything was okay-to-good, and some of the dishes are even memorably good (the tex-mex taco beef with warmed tortillas did it for me in a childhood taco-tuesday kinda way). We purchased the unlimited drinks package and weren't impressed with the refill frequency on our beer and wine, which we feel may have been an intentional way of controlling costs, preventing guests from getting unruly, or perhaps a bit of both. Regardless, we had maybe 3 drinks in our hour or so at the buffet and felt like maybe it wasn't worth paying for the add-on.   Brunch was another story. The breakfast fare was competently prepared and exactly what you'd expect. Bacon, eggs, hash browns, I think there may have been some dim sum, tasty but nothing special. However, the drink service was a different story. Even with the fact that the mimosas were watered down, we ended up trashed, and fast. We were having to turn down refills to catch our breath. Our server either wanted us to have a really good time, or had some kind of personal vendetta against livers.   There are better buffets on the strip, there are cheaper places to eat on the strip, there are better, cheaper buffets on the strip. But hey, if you're staying at the Flamingo, hungry and just want to go eat a bunch of stuff without a ton of fuss, maybe look at some pink birds, there's nothing wrong with checking out the Paradise Buffet.",

Totally it's worth to try when you spend your time vegas!",

I purchased a Groupon for 2 for 49 which included unlimited mimosas. The mimosas aren't hand made. They come already made from a company( as the waitress told us) they gave us small plastic cups which you get at a child's party for mimosas. They have an okay selection for brunch. The usual stuff. Omelet station, a mix of breakfast and lunch. Chinese, fried chicken, taco bar etc. the food was lackluster at best. I'm sure there are better buffets worth it. This one wasn't.",

It was not crowded at all so we were able to get a nice table by a window and were able to see Pink Flamingos and all the fish and ducks swimming below us.  The variety was good but very simple in selection. Basic at best but satisfying. I did like the communal beverage station where you can get what you want when you want it.  Inside it was very clean and bright and plates were cleared away as soon as they were empty. We had very nice service, better than the average buffet service.",

Here's the rundown:  -There's a crazy line outside even though there are hella empty tables inside (not sure why) -Omelette station was okay, but the chef was SUPER slow; watching him slowly cook while waiting was painful. He also decided to put a ridiculous amount of cheese on it; didn't try to stop him because I just wanted my food -Bottomless mimosas are okay but you need to flag down a waitress everytime you want a refill -Sushi was super stale - avocado was brown and the fish was a pale colour - avoid if you don't want a stomachache! -Regular hot dishes were okay. -Mac and cheese was surprisingly bad - how can you mess that up?? :( -Desserts were a hit or miss. Some tasted okay, but my friend said the donut was hard -Cute view of the flamingos/waterfall park  Overall, its not super expensive so I'm not salty about it but if you actually want good food, go somewhere else. If you just want to eat and be full, this place is okay.",

    "text": "We decided to try this buffet out for ourselves before looking at the Yelp reviews!  We came here on a weekday for brunch. There was no line and we were seated immediately. The buffet options were limited, but we knew that going in because it was just brunch items. I do have to say we were actually really impressed with the quality of the food.   We thoroughly enjoyed our brunch and the view of the flamingos. The drinks are self-serve which is kind of neat; you get to try a bunch of different sodas and there's also a cool coffee/latte machine.   I could only imagine that dinner would be just as enjoyable, especially if they keep up with the quality of food and expand options as well.   So we gave it 3 stars. For a buffet on the strip, it was well worth the price we paid for brunch. The food was good, but again, for a buffet on the strip, the decor is a little dated and there aren't a lot of options compared to the newer buffets. If you're in the area, stop by for a quick bite, but don't go out of your way.",

The buffet kept the same charming atmosphere and it was kind of a nod to Vintage Vegas. You can look outside and still see the pink flamingo's parading about the Garden area outside. It's a rather large venue even though the seating is a little too jammed together...almost as if youre eating with your neighbor.  The buffet line and food is presented very neatly and nicely in my opinion. I went to the brunch buffet so they had a very unique offering to include a live omelette and live crepe station. Everything I had tasted very good, the only complaint I had was the drink service which was slow and spotty.  I feel however the brunch buffet was a little too expensive to call it a good value, but I will reiterate that the food here was of good quality and the selection was adequate. I do plan to come back for dinner to see how that has changed for the better  ....Stay tuned!",

Also a good selection of fruits, cheeses, and smoked salmon. What upset me the most was that they ran out of cocktail shrimp very early on, then didnt refill it and just replaced it with salad!

The sushi looked like it had been left out for hours, the crab legs were skimpy, the shrimp was slimy, the salad fixin's were limp, fruit looked like it came out of a can, the desserts were dry and tasted cheap.  We were a table of 6 and ALL of us were disappointed.  To make matters worse, the cashier was SO INCREDIBLY RUDE ((Martha)), and when we asked to speak to a manager ((Kevin)) I had never seen anyone look so annoyed at me in my life.  Horrible customer service, AWFUL food.  AVOID THIS PLACE LIKE THE PLAGUE.",

Good variety. I loved their mountain of seafood though! That was amazing. Crabs, shrimp, crawfish. I gobbled that shiz up. Everyone always talks smack about the shrimp still being in their shell, but I thought it was normal since that's how it goes down in my house.   Staff was a little slow, but not anything too ridiculous. They were very kind and courteous, too.   Dessert variety was awesome! So many little delectable items. But of course, I couldn't resist the strawberry crepes with soft-serve on the side and chocolate syrup, mmmm.   The view of the wildlife is cool, too. I love watching flamingos and ducks while I eat their distant cousins simmered in a fine sauce.  The lighting is a little depressing, tho. It takes mood lighting one step too far.   Go eat here, it's delicious.",

Pro's: - it's a buffet - might be near you  Con's: - long lines/lots of people - stressed out waitress service - food might not be to die for  If you go to one of the tix4tonite box offices, you can get discounts on a number of buffets, shows, and other types of entertainment.  In the process, we saved about $100.  My advice: get there early enough to avoid long lines, and to get the best deals available.  The same kinda goes for meal lines and buffets (although, a lot of people like to eat early to be free later).",

They have a champagne brunch on Sunday for $25 I think we skip that since we don't drink champange.  For lunch if you can wait until 3:30 you can pay for lunch and get some of the dinner foods.

She dropped a plate on my table, brought me like 1 napkin at a time, never filled my drinks etc etc. Now on to the food, EVERYTHING was just bad, the hot food was cold and the cold food was hot. The crab legs were the tiniest little things I have ever seen. I heard the waitress telling the people behind us if they wanted good crab legs go to the Rio hahah.  The waitress telling people to go elsewhere WOW.  It tasted like everything was old. Ok the desert bar was pretty good, everything else sucked. People should NEVER go to this.",

When I asked for a clean table she acted like it was a chore. Then I proceeded to get my son some food. When I picked up the tongs I noticed a bug flying around. Upon closer inspection there were numerous bugs flying around the food! And many more dead in the ice that surrounded the cold food and salad! A couple were crawling on their  sandwiches! I put down the plate and requested the manager for a full refund. Though the manager was courteous, it took him 20 min to issue my refund! And while I was standing there waiting for him to do the refund they continued to take more guests money and seat them. I take the 1 star I gave this place back and give them 0!

All the staff we encountered (cashier, hostess, servers) were extremely friendly.  I even watched the hostess deal with some poorly behaved guests, and she did so in a great way, staying cool and friendly.  VERY impressed with the staff.  The decor was nice, but a bit \"plastic.\"  After visiting the more elegant restaurants, this one felt a bit cheap, but then again, it was 1/2 the price of the other restaurants.  It was about $16 a person to eat dinner; that was the cheapest we've seen yet.  I guess you get what you pay for.  It reminded me of smaller version of Home Town Buffet or Sizzler, but the only food that was really outstanding was the cooked-to-order steak.  I am picky about steak, and this one deserved a 9/10!  It was really good, but nothing else stood out as great/good.  Though I couldn't pin-point any bad items for cleanliness, besides the mess people were making in the bathroom (I skipped it after a cursory glance in), it had a 'dirty vibe.'  (That's probably way too vague, but I can't explain it any other way except to say it didn't look exceptionally clean.)  It seems to me that with a good upholstery clean, and carpet clean, and just upping the presentation, not over-cooking most of the meat dishes, and adding some spice and presentation, they could raise their ratings (and price) a wee bit.",

The breakfast station was pretty empty everytime I went up, they weren't refilling it fresh.  And the buffet itself wasn't even crodwed.  There were a ton of weddings in there - either pre or post parties.  I can't remember if the mimosas were included or additional, but it was a pain to try to get them refilled.  We joked with our server to just leave the bottle so she wouldn't have to keep getting flagged down and she looked mortified.    Eh - go to Spice Market or Rio if you want a good buffet.",

Buffet's in Las Vegas have increased in price quite a bit in recent years and if the food quality if good, it is not a problem.",

On a busy weekend, they had 1 of 2 possible hot food sections open, causing a huge backup, taking away one of the benefits of a buffet...get your food and go.  Once we got our food, the quality was found lacking, with quality below that of a \"Hometown Buffet\" or \"Golden Corral\".  To add to the disappointment, crowd control was poor, with people waiting for their glacial omlette bar holding up the service line, and management shrugging their shoulders at suggestions to start a line just for omelets.  Also management did nothing to disuade people from eating on line, or using their hands to serve themselves from the buffet.  The only reason this is not a 1 star review, is the service at our table was good, keeping our beverages full.  While this used to be one of our favorite places ue to the view...we will not be back unless there is a huge improvement in this place.",

The prime rib wasn't bad and the desserts (chocolate fountain and ice cream) were good.  However, who has a chocolate fountain and has cantaloupe and melon and no strawberries?  The cheese potatoes were cold and not very good.  For breakfast, the eggs were watery, the omelet flavorless, and the bacon was really salty.  The waffles were pretty good.  We had a two-for-one, but even with that, it doesn't seem worth it (I mean I guess if you are desperate but definitely not worth full price!!)...not after you see what other buffets are like.  I guess it was our fault for going back.  The options were just so basic and limited and the price was not that much different from other buffets.  I have been to MGM, Rio, Aria (heck even a buffet in Palm Springs that I went to had more options that this!).  There was only about two rows of food and everything tasted \"off\" to me.  The waiter at dinner was also not very friendly and would stand around and do nothing while we had dirty plates on our table.  We went there because we were staying at the hotel and it seemed like you'd spend just as much money eating at the nearby cafe.  Maybe that would have been smarter, though, because this buffet is definitely not worth the money.  Go right outside and try some place on the Linq if you are starving and want something close by.",

The Flamingo is one of the buffet of buffets (24 hour buffet pass at 7 of the 8 Caesar's buffets) options and I think a very smart choice on weekends because they include the champagne in the pass while others charge you an additional fee to add on the champagne.  The offerings on the weekend are vast and change slightly as the morning progresses with breakfast items being replace by lunchier items.  During the week, they close down the back half of the buffet and the selection pretty much sucks.  They've also really cut back on their staffing levels --- servers are acting as bussers in many cases and this has definitely decreased the total level of once very prompt table service.  Bottom line:  buy the pass on the weekend, get yourself tipsy and avoid during the week.",

So I tried Asian kitchen and had some Chinese. It was okay. There was seafood section but I skipped it. Also, I had to find my server to get refill. Thankfully she was around when I needed my tea. Best part was dessert. They had no sugar section which I skipped. Mini desserts were delicious. Tried carrot cake, creme brulee, cheese cake, chocolate fountain twice. It was okay for $25.

The center section is packed with delicious deserts.   I know, you don't usually think about desert after breakfast, but this is Vegas, so why not?  If you request it, they'll leave a pitcher of soda or coffee at your table (to save you from having to request refills).    Even though it's a buffet, remember to tip take care of your waitress.

Their dessert selection was fabulous, including a chocolate fountain with strawberries, canteloupe, marshmallows, rice krispie treats etc. Plus they had dipped marshmallows, cake pops, apple cobbler, crepes and cakes and pies. And cotton candy. Honestly, the best dessert selection of a buffet that I have been to.  I wasn't impressed with the main selections, though. The mashed potatoes were good and the salad bar was adequate (including a tasty crab salad I had seconds of and peel and eat shrimp), but the Italian and Asian selections weren't too tasty and the prime rib was a little overdone and tough.   I won't go back, simply because there are so many other places to try, but after a long day on our feet and not wanting to stray from our hotel it served its purpose. Also, the service was great.

Then to top it off once inside huge line of people waiting for them to bring the food out. Sometimes the cheap comes out expensive.",

    "text": "This review is for the \"Buffet of Buffets\" 24 hour, all you can eat, buffet pass. This magical pass allows you to enjoy all day access to the buffets at 7 different Harrah's properties. The price is $39.99 for Rewards Club members and $45.99 for non-members. It is seriously easy to sign up for the pass and worth the $5 savings. The best day to buy the pass is Sunday because the brunch buffets include the booze free of charge. Also, remember to check the operating hours at each buffet because they do vary.  Note: We did all seven locations (actually 8 buffets because we hit one twice) back to back in 11 hours.  The buffets included in the deal are: Le Village Buffet inside Paris, Planet Hollywood's Spice Market Buffet, Flamingo's Paradise Garden Buffet, Flavors at Harrah's, Lago Buffet at Caesars, the Emperor's Buffet at Imperial Palace and Rio's Carnival World Buffet!  We started our 24 hour eating adventure at 7:52 Sunday morning at the Flamingo.  Paradise Garden Buffett- Decent breakfast selection including a carving station with prime rib and ham. Warning, don't piss off the man carving the prime rib because he has sharp knives and a short temper...just sayin'. They also have cotton candy and a chocolate fountain in the dessert section which is fun, even at 8 o'clock in the morning.   We made a second stop here at noon, which is when the Sunday brunch starts and your first bloody mary is free. They give you an airplane bottle of vodka at the cashier and you are able to visit the nicely appointed \"make your own bloody mary bar.\" Note, each additional airplane bottle of vodka will cost you $3. My suggestion is to bring a flask. Also, champagne is included with brunch.  Overall, the food is pretty average here. Breakfast service was robotic, and the psychotic man at the carving station has a short temper and sharp knives so beware. Just don't ask for a more rare piece of prime rib and you should be fine. The service at brunch was awesome!",

The middle section is filled with all kinds of desserts, cakes, cheesecake, cookies, ice cream with toppings, cotton candy, and make your own crepes.   Taste-wise, this buffet is excellent, they had some Dim Sum when I went a week ago and it was delicious, the Alfredo Pasta was great as well.  Bottom line:  Been going here for years and would come back again, especially since this buffet is part of that 24 hour Buffet Pass Deal.",

I was in shock!! and then she came to a conclusion that was a vegetable soup which I doubted and there comes another staff member from the kitchen and said oh this has some chicken breast!! at that moment I just walked away from that spot simply because I didn't want to commit a crime. this place is simply a shame, it shouldn't be in Vegas the city of great food and entertainment! I really believe third world countries have way better quality and cleaner food than that, and imagine what kind of staff they hire if they don't even know what they're preparing for guests! and not to mention that the food has no flavor whatsoever. not only if they invite me there for free but even if they offer me $$$ I will not step into that dump ever again in  my life, and by the way I am a big Vegas fan which I go there at least half a dozen times a year.",

    "text": "Las Vegas is a town that is known for it's buffets, and I'm sorry to say that just about any of them would be a better choice than the Paradise Garden Dinner Buffet.   Located in the flamingo, the buffet offers most of the standard buffet fare - Crab Legs, Sushi, Prime Rib, Orange Chicken, Fried Rice, etc. It's just that none of these selections are very good.  On 2nd thought, the Crab legs were pretty tasty - unfortunately I spent 20 minutes trying to crack open the meat since they didn't offer shell crackers.   Someone below commented that the food selections were often mis-labeled, and in some cases not labeled at all. This was a pet peeve of mine as well. It's actually sad how many times I had to examine something more closely, only to walk away empty handed because I wasn't exactly sure what it was!  The servers were friendly, but the attitudes of the chefs seemed disgruntled, as if my request to cut a slice of meat was an inconvenience. The whole experience was underwhelming, which would have been understandable if this were a $7.95 buffet at the Palace Station. But for $20/person in a strip casino, I expect a little bit better.   My advice, spend the extra $10 person and go to the Wynn/Bellagio/Mandalay or any of the other awesome buffets located in the vicinity.",

We were just starving and didn't feel like wandering around looking for one so we settled for the Paradise Garden Buffet. It was much more expensive than some other buffets... probably because they offer king crab legs and other seafood items. I tried so much at this buffet and ended up with horrible stomach pains. I don't know if the food was sitting out there too long or what.   I am a dessert fanatic and I did enjoy the dessert buffet. But other than that, hit up the Bellagio or Paris buffet instead!",

All the usual suspects were offered, and it was all fresh and tasty. The made to order omlettes were nice. We used 2-for-1 coupons everyday, but we still thought it was a bit pricey for breakfast. Of course, you can get your money's worth by stuffing yourself silly. I think I set a bacon consumption record while I was there.  Two less than thrilling points:   * Sitting by the windows gives you a great view of the flamingo habitat. Unfortunately, we  were told they were reserved for \"Gold Members\". WTF? They were empty! You still have an okay view though.  * My BIG tip: When a server comes to offer drinks, order a couple! They don't swing by too often.  I'm sure there are better buffets around town, but as I said, we were lazy.",

I spent most my time opening the heat containers and figuring what was what than eating. Egg rolls weren't bad and they had cotton candy. What I liked most was sitting at my table and watching the Chilean Flamingo area and Koi fish. Oh and the ducks and swans were pretty entertaining, too.",

We got in for cheap because we had tickets to a comedy/magic show that included the buffet all for $25. They normally charge $22 alone for the buffet at dinner.   There was crab legs (by the beef, not where I expected to find it), crayfish, shrimp, salad bar, fruit.  The entrees were not so great, but the fried shrimp was pretty good. They were pretty nice about giving me a huge pot of water for my tea bag, better than the Bellagio in that respect.  Desserts were not as good as the Bellagio, but they do have someone making you fresh fruit crepes which hubby says the strawberries in his didn't taste good.  The coconut macaroons were very good.  If you don't mind splurging and waiting an hour in line, the Bellagio is better but if you're on a budget, the Flamingo will suffice just to keep your tummy fed.",

Ceilings are high, tables and booths are clean. Service is not fantastic--a bunch of tired old ladies serve you.   As breakfast goes, Flamingo is mediocre but it'll do the job. Prices here are lower compared to, say, Mandalay Bay or Bellagio.  3 stars. If you want a breakfast buffet in Vegas that tastes okay and has a great view, I recommend Flamingo. I do make a stop here for brunch every year when I come to Vegas. Afterwards you can take a stroll out back to look at the flamingoes and the fish in a very natural and beautiful habitat. They used to have penguins too, an exhibit I would watch for hours.",

I have eaten here once before and did not remember the buffet being so boring and the food so tasteless. The best part was the service and sitting by the window near the water and flamingos.   I don't really feel I need to get specific but the food was all just okay. I took just one bite of many items because nothing was worth finishing. The desserts I tried however were good. The apple crisp was especially nice. They also have a chocolate fountain but it is kind of difficult to use since there is a large plastic guard around it with one tiny area for access to coat your dessert with chocolate. Bananas were virtually impossible to dip. They did have a crepe station but we did not try it.   We went here because we heard they had a Chinese station but it was closed when we dined on a Monday night.   This place is only worth dessert as far as I'm concerned.  Ask if you can look at what they have available before you pay to dine.",

There's only 3 registers so it takes awhile to be able to pay and then you need to wait in another line to be sat.  Most employees here are a bit older, but are really sweet. The service was pretty good, I always had my drinks refilled. When I asked for hot sauce, the lady came out with 4 which I really appreciate. The food was definitely Americanized, and I don't think it was that great but for 20 bucks, I got ribs, orange chicken, and crab legs. They also split the crab legs for you so it's easier to eat. I liked the dessert mainly because they had chocolate fondue and my boyfriend got himself a crepe which was great. I just didn't enjoy the food all that much. The pad thai was very much americanized and the rice wasn't cooked well enough. But for $20, I left very full and satisfied!",

I wouldn't recommend this buffet to anyone - most of the food looked dried out and like it had been sitting out for too long, although the desserts looked okay and the crepes bar was a nice touch.  The food was was average at best, but the worst part of our meal was when my husband bit into a piece of chicken and it was still raw in the middle.  Not just pink, but literally oozing bloody chicken juice!  We complained to the server and she removed the plate and then returned to our table to say that they checked the temperature on the chicken and decided to remove the tray.  Not that we were expecting any compensation, but an apology or a visit from a manager would have been nice, considering how sick a person can get from uncooked chicken.  My husband spent the rest of the night feeling ill, and it really put a damper on our last evening of vacation.  My advice? Steer clear of this buffet, there are many better places to eat in Vegas.",

Either that or I just get excited seeing a whole bunch of desserts since I try not to indulge that often.  Pretty standard issue foods otherwise: a few sushi selections (including veggie rolls?), some Asian fair, taco bar, a variety of meat and seafood, potatoes, and rolls.  Lunch buffet was $16.99 and you can tack on $9.99 for unlimited mimosas, wine, Bloody Mary's, and beer if you'd like.  Service isn't bad and drinks are refilled often and quickly.

Hell, I didn't even finish the tiny bits I put on my plate. To top it off, it costs $23 plus tax. On the low average for dinner buffets in vegas, but not even close to being worth it.

Just a couple things here and there. This wasn't a buffet, it was food already chosen for your meal that you get up and go get yourself. Avoid the Donnie and Marie dolls in the gift shop on your way there because I think they're cursed.",

The last time I was here I damn near kicked the bucket as I didn't realize that the horseradish was extremely spicy and I had plopped it into my prime rib...   The service was good as I sat in the diamond lounge and enjoyed the complimentary champagne.  However there wasn't much selection.   I noticed that after consolidation of the Caesars Branded hotels, most of the buffets started to offer the same selection at the same prices. So nothing was ever again amazing.  With the 25 hour deals where you pay up front you can enjoy any of their buffets- which seems like a deal but seriously isn't worth it when the lines get busy.   I never had to wait though based on my player status but still, I felt bad for those who did.  What was great though was I was able to pay for my meals and my wife's via comps, so this was a great option instead of fine dining lol.",

Poor little things. =( I did enjoy the rack of bananas and dried fruit. Loved the chickpeas at the salad bar! Not too shabby, to be honest. It's just not the best. It'll keep your belly full at least without spending too much.   What I liked about this buffet were the employees. They were kind and nice. Our waiter was helpful and oh-so-adorable! She kept asking how we were doing and refilled our waters when possible. She was very attentive. I even dropped my water bottle cap on the floor, and she asked me if I wanted it washed. I just want to give her a hug. She's too sweet. :)   Sooo, the service was pleasant. I'm not sure if I would come back here anytime soon, since there are so many food places to explore in Vegas!",

Much of the food was warm at best.   Friday night Seafood buffet = cold crab legs, lobster mac and cheese (no lobster meat).  All food was tasteless and warm at best.  Dessert was nothing special.  Had groupon for $44.00 for two I am glad I did not pay more.  Waitress was a little better still had to flag her down to get anything.  FYI beer glass must be empty for them to bring a refill. Sangria served in a plastic cup. Bottom line much better places in Vegas and most likely in your home town.",

( dinner had unlimited beer, wine, sangria. they only had coors light beer.) probably why they were taking so long so people don't go crazy.   Our waitress was already cleaning up our table telling us bye before we even left and she never came back to refill drinks or check on us.   ** if you're using a groupon voucher with line pass, get in the short line to pay. looks just its just for VIP members but you can go there. save you about 20 min wait in line.**",

They charged me 21.99 plus tax for my 11 yr old son who was considered adult price, 9 and under is kids price.  The best thing was the garden area that you could visit right outside the dining area, lots of light from the glass windows too, however beware that once you go outside, the doors lock and you cannot get back inside without going all the way around to the front of the buffet again.  The food was OK, but the selection was limited and not impressive.  Desserts were attractive and photo worthy.  Servers were nice, but you're paying for the ambience, not the food quality.",

It hit the spot and wasn't too expensive. I liked the omelet bar and corned beef hash (the two items that left a lasting memory). :)  Good service and free mimosas with the players card on Sundays!",

    "text": "Being an occasional poker player, I was in need of a way to waste my rewards and I thought I should take a friend to this buffet. The bad reviews are surprising because this buffet is actually one of the cheapest on the strip with the best atmosphere.  This buffet is located inside the Flamingo hotel on the strip and you can park at their parking lot for a fee.   The greatest thing about this place is definitely the view. You can sit right by the flamingos, ducks, etc... making your dining experience pretty unique on the strip. Also, this buffet comes with alcohol included which is pretty rare. That only makes it worth the price whether you plan on drinking champagne in the morning or wine at night.  The food is good for a buffet without being exceptional but you do have the option of ordering burritos, quesadillas and crepes which is a nice addition.  In conclusion, I would say that this place is one of the best buffets on the strip mainly because of the views and because of its great quality/price ratio when you compare it to other buffets such as the Bellagio's or the one at Caesar's. Feel free to message me for any additional details that you may need!",

Overall they met all my breakfast cravings from toast, pancakes, French toast, sausage, bacon, and omelettes and other yummy items.

I had the cherry pie and it was very good.  Service was very attentive and atmosphere was nice and clean.  Unlimited bloody Mary's and mimosas made this a popular place for many people.

The hostess didn't know where to sit us. Never even came back to check on us. This place screams 70's, very outdated. The only thing going for this place is the view of the Koi fishes outside the garden.",

    "text": "Solid 3-star. Could be so much better, but \"A-OK\" for what it is. There are three sections: Asian, Dessert and regular Buffet-style.   Asian section had a small selection of sushi (which I didn't try), various hot items like pot stickers, pork buns, etc., fried and steamed rice, various noodle dishes, typical chinese items like beef w/veggie and Gen'l Chang's chicken. Large section of build-your-own-soup where you select the items you want in your soup and give it to someone (I didn't try this, either) to make the soup for you. A lot of people were getting this, so I'm guessing it's decent. Of the items from this section that I had the pork buns were mostly bun and very little pork .. but the pork that was in there was good. Pan fried dumplings were fine as were samosas.   In the regular buffet section, the prime rib was a bit disappointing. Not enough flavor. The fried chicken looked pretty good, but I didn't go back for it. Mashed potatoes w/gravy were good as was the mac & cheese (although it needed to have richer flavor, IMO). There were a lot of choices, but I wasn't in the mood for most of them, so I passed.   See .. I needed to save room for dessert. The dessert section is in the middle, so as I went to check out the Asian section, I saw what was waiting there and I knew I would not want to miss dessert.   Pineapple upside down cake? Ok. Chocolate fountain with marshmallows, macaroons and fruit for dipping? Certainly! Cotton damn candy .. wrapped? I'll take one to go. thankyouverymuch.  Sure. I feel like I need to boot after over-indulging, but it was worth it.",

    "text": "This buffet is in the Flamingo hotel and has a beautiful location with large windows viewing the habitat area.  It's cheaper than most others too: about $20 for an adult dinner.  There were long line waiting to pay, and long lines waiting to get seated.  The cashier was really nice.  The hostess was less nice, seating my family next to a large table of loud \"frat boys\".  At least all they were was loud since I was expecting them to get rude and vulgar... but they appear to have been well-bred frat boys since that never happened.  They left eventually.  The selection is varied but considerably smaller than most other Vegas buffets.  What was notable, though, was the clear inferiority of the food.  Much of it just didn't look good.  Some didn't look like was being described.  For example, there was a sign for \"chicken and cheese pierogie\" but what I tasted was a previously frozen, breaded chicken stuffed with cheese.  Nothing at all like a pierogie!  Crab legs were not split, making eating them messy.  One interesting item not seen on some of the other budget buffets was crawfish.   Even the salad bar offerings was sparse.  Oddly, only goopy salad dressings and not an oil/vinegar option.  Wierd.  Best items: the bread rolls (really), and the plain horseradish.  Worst item: the gelatinous brown gravy.  Recommended items: the slightly tough rib roast and baked potato (how can they screw that up... except to mark them as baked SWEET potato).  If you insist on sour cream for the baked potato... I couln't find any so substituted the creamed horseradish instead.    Weirdest item:  an entire area full of Middle Eastern and Italian \"mezze\", but practically empty.  We didn't really eat much, and enjoyed even less.  Dessert selection didn't dissapoint in quantity.  As expected, some items looked better than others.  The kids just LOVED dipping marshmallows and fruit in the chocolate fountain.  I opted for a fresh-made crepe.  the guy making the crepe did a nice job making it.  then offered a choice of four or five fruit fillings (canned pie filling kids of stuff).  Then, in one amazing motion, folded the crepe into a apple-filled football-like configuration, and flopped it onto the plate.  Could have been more dainty, I suppose, but it never changed the taste... which was just OK.  The waiter, though, almost drove this review into the 1-star category.  He was an nice older man who was tired and seems to have had no aptitude or interest in being a waiter.  He was never there when we needed him, and when he did show up never looked at us and took off so fast we couldn't ask him for anything... like beverage refills.  Throughout our meal he took care of refills of my wife and kids, once, but seemed to avoid me like I had the mark of Satan on my forehead.  Of course, when we were leaving, he cuddled up and made nice-nice  to \"Satan\"... presumably  in hopes of a tip.",

The mexican food tasted like dog food, if I ever would have tried dog food i'd assume thats what it would taste like, lol. and the deserts were hard and tasteless.   The waitress could barely speak english and hardly came over to clear our table. But she was handling ten tables and was still friendly and smiled so i knew she was trying.  next after we left we found out the buffet had to be closed because a rat ran across the buffet floor! gross! don't come here!",

    "text": "This review is for 11/13/2010.  I lost majority of my receipts and I managed to just get this out of my bag. As many of you know, I am a Vegas lover. Who isn't?! I got a BOGO offer from Harrah's to tryout any of their properties buffet. I wanted to try something different. With my mom's birthday at hand, I decided to go to Flamingo's Paradise Garden Buffet for the breakfast buffet.   When we arrived at the restaurant area, there was a lot of people lined up. However, it was for the Tropical Breeze Cafe. When we walked a little bit to Paradise Garden Buffet, there was another line, but it was for special guests...lol. I guess Special Guests were treated like normal customers. So, I went to the regular line and in seconds I was at a cashier while the others waited in line for minutes.   I was greeted by Brenda. I gave her my Total Rewards Card, my coupon, my ID, and my credit card. Wow...that's a lot to give for food. Apparently, we came in during Champagne Brunch. Since it was just my mom and me, the total would have been $52.00. Whoa...$52 for two...Don't forget my coupon. My total would be $27.01. It would be $24.99 per person for Champagne Brunch.  When you do pay, they ask what you would like to drink. Its not extra charge, but its just a way to get servers tips since there is no soda fountain. We were seated by Marilou or Mary Lou and OFF TO GET FOOD!!! OMG, they had shrimp and mussels. I knew I had to fill me up. I got my eggs, sausage, this weird looking egg muffin that had no bread on top, but bread on the bottom, salmon, and hash browns. I got another plate and filled it with shrimp and mussels. YUMMO!!!  Best meal of the day. Unfortunately, my mother and I didn't take advantage of the free champagne since we don't drink. The shrimp and the mussels were the best part of the meal. It was like I was a whale and just ate the whole Pacific Ocean. Meal is a little pricey, but we are nowhere near the ocean and there was life here at a casino that seems like it was falling apart. Plus, the coupon help pay for my Mom's Birthday...lol.  The Yelp Universe. Where are you traveling today?",

They cannot be blamed. our server was taking care of half the floor. I requested milk from a woman in a suit and was directed to request it from the server. The second time i saw the woman in the suit, i informed her that i have not seen the server and i would like a glass of milk. She then yelled across the floor to our server to get us a glass of milk. Poorly handled and demeaning to the server. I certainly will not come here again.",

Went early in the morning and the buffet had very little breakfast food. Most of the food options seemed lunch oriented, like Spanish rice, pasta, sliced turkey breast, etc. Despite this, the food I did try was of good quality and the bottomless mimosas definitely took the edge off of my hangover. I recommend it if you're looking for something within the Flamingo itself.",

The best thing about it is the view of the flamingos in the exhibit, if you get a good seat. Other than that, it is a cheap buffet with cheap food. The selection is smaller than an average buffet. You could tell that the food was sitting a while without being replenished. I took a few items on my plate and only one thing was good enough to eat. The ravioli. Other than that, there was a horrible tasing gravy and mash potatoes and Mac and cheese that I couldn't have more than one bite of. Horrible. Thankfully we didn't pay or I would be asking for my money back as all I ate today was two pieces of ravioli. We had the buffet pass so we decided to check it out. I would probably say this buffet tastes like a cheap hotel buffet at any hotel around America. It does not hold up to any Vegas standards.",

    "text": "Great hotel, horrible buffet. There were far more wrongs then rights at this low end buffet. My girlfriend and I did the 24 hour buffet pass for $55.00 each and this one was number one on our. Lets start with the good and end with the bad.  The desserts were actually pretty good. Red velvet cupcakes moist with creamy frosting, and very tasty cream cheese danishes. The whole place had a very open feeling with extra high ceilings, large windows and bright sunlight. The windows offer a good view of the Flamingo wild life including, different types of ducks, coy fish, cat fish, flamingos, and some other birds. They do have a large amount of seats which I can not ever imagine them filling. The food was decent, about a 3 stars. Desserts and pizza were my favorite. Now on to the disappointing part.  We came for breakfast at about 10:30 so there was a good amount of people in line just to get in. The way they have set up the buffet makes it inconvenient to get to the food. They have the carving and omelet stations right in the middle so the lines that form for those block all the other food. Some things I could only get one of because people in line for an omelet were blocking the way. Selection was not that good either, they claimed to have a Mexican food section, but that was simply a joke. A bucket of jalapenos, peppers, sour cream, and onions is not a Mexican station.  The service here was hit and miss at best. Our first server spoke almost no English and gave us half of the drinks we ordered two coffees, two orange juices, and a tomato juice. We asked for some hot sauce and he never came back. He just seamed a little disoriented and not very alert, a complete disconnect from the customers. A lady came up to us and asked us how we were doing and we let her know that we needed some hot sauce and shortly after she came back with some hot sauce. So one did almost nothing for us and the other one was nice and accommodating. The other servers were a bit rude and seamed to expect us to move out of their way when we went to the buffet.  We tested out three buffets during this trip, all associated with Caesar's entertainment group and this one was by far the worst. They seam to not pay attention to the details and tried to cut some corners. With just a few tweaks they could be so much better, but for now if you are in the area seek a cure for your hunger elsewhere.",

Granted, there are crab legs, salad bar, spaghetti and meatballs, some kind of roast beef, fried chicken, maybe a couple sushi rolls and more, but the it's not that large when it comes to dinner and the food is really pretty blah. We went because we had a buy one get one free, and it was barely worth that, but food isn't cheap in Vegas when you're eating out.  The best part was the cotton candy on the dessert bar, hubby liked the soft serve ice cream. They even had this very strange white chocolate skull filled with a nasty flavored cinnamon pudding. I wouldn't eat there again unless it was free.",

    "text": "I very rarely complain about the food at restaurants, but I was shocked by how much I disliked the buffet at the Flamingo. Usually I've got to the pricier buffets when I've been in Vegas, and always liked them, but we decided to look at something a little cheaper to make up for our other expensive meals of the weekend, and found ourselves at Flamingo.   The food wasn't very fresh. Nothing was warm or cold - just a lukewarm temperature. We tried the spring rolls, several of the vegetable dishes, fried rice, shrimp, cocktail sauce, crab legs, salads, desserts... basically gave everything a try. The spring rolls and crackers were chewy, while all the sauces were inedible. The cocktail sauce had such a strong horseradish taste that I nearly choked on it, and I'm not sure what was in the Caesar dressing but it was awful and had a weird, gritty texture (almost like sand). My dining partner said the desserts were very good.   The saving grace for dinner was the make your own pasta bar. It was something that I easily could have made at home, but it was fresh, tasty, and the only reason that I left feeling full.   The service was also very friendly and helpful, but with food like that I'd rather spend the extra money to go to the Buffet at the Aria.",

Chicken fried steak and gravy was better, but the sausages were dry and tasteless. The waitress was exceptional and provided ample refills and cleared our plates quickly.  One of the nice parts of eating here is that you have a view of the Habitat and get to watch the birds walking around their enclosure. 2 for the food and +1 for the friendly server that brought our drinks and cleared the dishes, Join the toal rewards program to get a dollar of each person's buffet.",

Honestly, I was pleasantly surprised with the awesome view of the flamingo garden and the plentiful seafood.    I mainly ate the crab legs, shrimp cocktail, guacamole, sushi, and salmon.  The sushi mainly consisted of crab and tuna rolls.  Nothing special, but decent with some soy sauce.  They also had cooked salmon and raw salmon dishes, both of which were delicious!    Since we were there for a late lunch (around 4 p.m.) we also got to enjoy some of the dinner specialties.

You wait in line for a tiny glass.  Gross. I couldnt take more than a sip of the bloody Mary. And I don't know where to start in my criticism of the buffet food. Brunch was poorly stocked. Nearly every item was empty when we arrived, and nobody was in any hurry to refill anything. The salad bar was a mess and didn't even have the proper items.  No soup. The dessert bar is as big as the food bar but it was only stocked with dozens of the same items. The piece of cake I took was literally rock hard. Please don't stand in line to eat here.",

It's actually a delicious pork stew but Asian style. To me it looks like chunks of pork shoulder or pork belly braised in a sweet soy sauce base with ginger and scallions. It kinda taste like teriyaki pork if it was like pulled pork or a Hawaiian Kaulua pork but even better! There is steamed rice next to it. This is my suggestion, get s Soup bowl, scoop some rice, then scoop the \"salsa verde\" aka pork stew, try not to get the fatty pieces and don't forget to scoop some sauce. Next go to the sushi section and squirt some sriracha sauce if you don't like things too sweet. Some broccolini and roasted yams compliment the stew. Please trust me. I know this buffet isn't stellar but if you gotta eat here, you will be saved. I was about to talk a ton of smack about this place until my hubby found the delicious pork stew dish. If you are home sick and just want to taste Asian comfort, this will be your next go to. You will be like holy crap... damn I was hella missing out!",

We enjoyed the made to order omelette, the wide assortment of veggie lovers options, and the desserts. At a glance, the desserts didn't look to be anything special however they were all very tasty. Definitely the best tasting desserts of the three we tried (mirage buffet and Harrahs). This buffet needs to step up there game and offer the drink stations like the others and it would probably rank higher. I probably wouldn't visit again unless I were to receive a deal.",

However, once inside I got my first mimosa down and my first plate of food and I was feeling good!   The food selection was pretty good, I enjoyed the lunch foods more than the breakfast foods. However, on my second round I waited for a freshly made crepe and was thoroughly pleased. I asked the crepe guy if he could put strawberries and \"lots of nutella\" in my crepe. He definitely came through for me! It was delicious.   We stayed in the buffet for 1.5 hours and we each gulped down 3 mimosas, so we made sure to make the money count. The desserts were fun too!",

Is taco meat necessary at 8 am? It's pretty  basic, pancakes, waffles, runny scrambled eggs. I think for the amount of money, you could totally find a better place it eat and spend money.",

Most had the texture of medical grade rubber. Ya, no.   ***Remember the champagne is free!!! But they won't offer it to you, you have to ask. It's bad though. Very cheap and way too sweet. Gives you a stomachache.   Ambiance was spacious and well lit but looked like a retirement center in Florida. Overall disappointed on the variety of items offered compared to other buffets.

Food was great, I had the Mac and cheese, French toast, sausage, bacon, bagels.. idk what else but i can go on lol because i ate so much. Honestly the only reason why I'm giving it a 4 star is because the chocolate muffin tasted like fish- like tilapia fish. It was so strange and gross. I also did not like the way we \"had to make it aware we wanted alcohol before seating\". We've never been here before and knew about the bottomless mimosas so we went to get food and realized a server never came after 30 minutes so I went to ask a hostess. She said \"u need to wait for ur server\". I said \"we've been waiting for 30 minutes\". She said \"u wanted liquor?\" I said \"yes we did, we're sitting right here\" she said \"u had to tell us this before hand let me handle seating people and I'll help you\". 10 minutes later a server came and told us the same thing and was rude about it too. \"You all had to of had tell someone it was liquor u wanted because most folks don't want mimosas or Bloody Mary\". We apologized for not knowing but I almost feel like this is a tourist resort. Like the whole strip is! And this should be on a sign somewhere or on the Groupon perhaps. We will come back for the food, not for the service. I'll just ignore the shit out of it and avoid the fishy muffins",

We literally did not even get through one plate of food before we got up and walked out. We spent less than 15 mins there. The serving staff that is in charge of serving alcoholic beverages were all just standing around while numerous patrons tried to get their attention. We weren't even able to order the drinks that came with the dinner package we purchased. $50 wasted as we can no longer get a refund from groupon.

This is due to having only one cashier and one hostess for seating. The weekday selections were limited for a Las Vegas buffet but since this is one of the cheaper buffets on the strip I guess you get what you pay for. The only real standout was the omelet bar otherwise nothing special. The service was great and dirty dishes were removed from the table in a timely manner. Overall the restaurant was clean and the cold items seemed cold and the warmer treys were at an good temperature. I will also mention that the unlimited mimosas had plenty of champagne in them and are worth the up charge. If you are staying at the Flamingo then this is a good place for brunch but definitely not worth the visit if staying elsewhere on the strip as there are better choices.",

To add insult to injury, the manager, after apologizing for her chefs rudeness, asked us if we wanted more food (mind you the food was inedible) she only offered platitudes with no real resolution. I had to call my credit card provider to dispute charges because we were not able to eat... oh yeah don't pay the extra dollar for the mimosas, they Sever them in plastic cups and it's pretty much watered down orange juice.

There was no wait on line for a table and the variety of food was not only diverse but on point in terms of taste.  Not to mention but their potato salad was so tasty I went back for thirds.  Their crepes were delicious and quickly made on the spot.  The desserts were very delicious and I appreciated the no sugar options.  Another key factor was their amazing customer service that goes above and over to make sure you feel invited and comfortable.  There isn't much to say about this place but that it's amazing. You all have to go and show this place some love.",

From the moment we arrived all the way up to getting my food, I had a feeling of dread. I was prepared for some awful food...There was no line when we walked up. We were quickly seated. The place was practically deserted aside from a handful of guests.  I got a couple of tortilla chips with some pico de gallo (I don't recommend) and filled the rest of my plate with hot (temperature-wise) crab legs. And let me tell you, SWEETEST crab legs/claws I have eaten in a long time! This was better than Bacchanal's crabs! So for the remainder of my meal there, I got plate after plate of them delicious crab legs/claws!  I finally had to move on to dessert since everyone else at my table was done, haha! I got the crepe. It's made to order and completely customizable; so I was able to add whatever I wanted instead of selecting #1 or #2 like Paris' buffet. Pretty tasty :D  So yes, I am giving this place the full 5 Stars! The crab claws are to die for~",

    "text": "A buffet with a view, that's the extent of Paradise Garden. That view is strictly a daytime thing, so it seems a majority of the patrons are here for lunch/brunch. It's a run of the mill Vegas buffet, with some interesting items, but is an overall lackluster experience.  First timers here might find the space impressive because it is. There aren't many midstrip lower end properties that will offer a spread like this, let alone with views of a vibrant garden. That's essentially the bread and butter of the experience because the options and quality of the food are subpar enough to have folks second guessing their visit.  During the brunch hour, there is a bottomless mimosa option, which is an attractive option for the weekend warriors looking to continue their Saturday hangover. Another thing I didn't expect was the \"Asian noodle\" station, where one can customize their bowl of noodle soup. I made a killer wonton noodle soup - I'm still shocked. Their crepes station is also a semi-thumbs up, but it really depends on who's making them.  The rest of the buffet is a tough to swallow. Literally. Anything fried is instant fail. The pizza is almost always a sure bet for a no-thank-you, most of the seafood is bland city, and if you're shooting for any of the BBQ or Mexican fare, then bless your appetite.  Prices aren't backbreaking for a strip property at $24 for dinner and brunch. Other than that it's $15-20 for everything else. If you happen to be rockin the 24 hour pass, then consider passing on the Flamingo version of buffetland.",

The eggs benedict tasted the same as bellagio eggs benedict. The donuts/muffins came out of a pink box.... The crepe station was yummy Waffles were yummy.. crunchy on outside and soft on the inside.  Had the usual breakfast items: muffins, donuts, cereal, salmon, vegetables, salad bar, fruits, sausages, omelette station, and its worth the breakfast price.

Needless to say, this package only existed because this sad excuse of a Vegas buffet needed the business boost.  There's only two stations, the main course and dessert. The crab legs were awful and smelly. The steak was dry. The chicken was not juicy. The dessert was all old cookies and cupcakes, and the fruits were gone by the time I got there. One saving grace is the novelty of the fondue fountain, which is enjoyable.   If you've come all the way to Vegas from wherever else in the world for an awesome buffet, there are plenty of alternatives. If it's too cold outside or you're too drunk to walk away from the Flamingo, give this place a shot. If they reduced their prices to match their quality, maybe it wouldn't be so bad. Get your stuff, together, Flamingo!",

Burger to order- thinner than a paddy on a McDoubble. Way too much bun. Pasta salad- way salty! Best thing I had here was a salad and to be honest, wasn't impressed there either. Ingredients in center of salad bar were quite difficult to reach. Didn't dare make a sandwich with their unidentifiable \"lunch meat\". I will say they had complimentary alcoholic beverages. Before he filled my glass I saw an inch of water in the bottom on my glass. He proceeded to fill my glass 3/4 the way full. I was confused by the whole interaction.  Please do yourself the favor and save the $21.61 for a LUNCH buffet and go elsewhere. I would have preferred McDonalds at this point.",

I understand bad days but when we see you being friendly and kind and giving to other customers and then barely answering us with an annoyed nod or \"you need to give me more time\" to get a simple mimosa? That's after the fifth time she walked around to see if everyone else was \"ok\" and never seeing if we needed anything.

The air was filled with cigarettes, mold, Bengay and heavy Jean Nate cologne.  I believe Jean Nate actually lived there.  What I absolutely forgot about this place is, there is an actual Flamingo sanctuary in the hotel's atrium.  That is a sight to see on it's own.  Who wouldn't want to take pictures with a cute pink flamingo?  We arrive at the counter.  There is no wait at 330pm for our lunch buffet.  Friendly lady in a wheelchair helps check us in.  We ask to be seated next to the Flamingo windows.  And first the hostess said those seats are reserved for Diamond members... but because it's 330pm and it was so empty, she went ahead and seated us there.  That was very nice.  But what I noticed was, instead of cloth napkins, we got cheap paper napkins.  But that's fine, I was able to use my extra's to sneak off 5 cookies from the dessert bar - shhhhhhh...  I would have never made it into Flamingo if it wasn't for this Buffet of Buffets thing I bought.  Since we stayed at Ballys and had no car, our legs were our fastest transportation to the next buffet.    I scanned the room for food.  I grabbed a foiled wrapped hamburger.  Fresh prime rib slice (the dude cutting the meat looked stoned out his mind and confirmed it when he dropped my slice off the side of my dish),  buttery mash potatoes, mac n cheese, and a bowl of clam chowder.  I ate everything.  It's okay, not bad at all.  I ended up at the dessert section for my 2nd round.  I grabbed 5 tasty cookies ;), a chocolate mousse cake and strawberries.  Then i went to the salad section and grabbed lettuce, black olives and dressing.  That was it.  I was done.  I was full but left room for my next buffet...  Tip: Always ask to be seated next to the Flamingo's.  It doesn't hurt to try to get the best seat in the house... you earned it after walking through Jean Nate's gambling section",

    "text": "If i could give 0 stars I would. The main reason why I came here was because it says bottomless mimosas. The waitress never came to our table to give us refills. After my first mimosa I had to get up and walk around the restaurant to look for the waitress to ask for a refill every time. And there were only like two other people eating in the restaurant when I was there!!! It wasn't busy she was just lazy, and very rude whenever I asked her for one. I said please and thank you and she never said you're welcome, she would just give me a dirty look. It's just very frustrating being at a restaurant and feeling like a nuisance when all I am asking for is someone to do their job. Oh and the food wasn't very good either. Don't go here. I know the \"bottomless mimosas\" are tempting, but it takes about 20 min to get each one and that's when you chase down the waitress every time. There are so many great food places in Vegas, don't make the same mistake I did",

Also, bf almost left wallet on table while we went to grab a plate and the most kind waitress flagged us down and reminded us of the wallet. (of course the leaving of the wallet was a total accident.)",

Well, everything my wife and I had during the breakfast buffet was bland, dry and cold.   The selection here is very limited compared to other breakfast buffets we've attended. So if you're looking for a place that has an overwhelming number of options ready for you to dive into, let me save you the time and tell you look elsewhere. Yes, other buffets can be pricey, but at least at those buffets the food quality is far better and you have a bigger selection of items to choose from.  The only real benefits of coming to this buffet is saving a few extra bucks.",

We were seated right away, the waitress who was helping us kept our drinks refilled and kept coming around to check on us.  They had the typical breakfast fare, sausage links, patties, bacon, biscuits and your choice of sausage gravy or creamed chipped beef gravy.  My favorite was the corned beef hash - definitely not from a can.  There was an omelet station and a crepe station.  The food that I did try was flavorful, hot (temperature wise) and fresh.  I haven't tried their lunch or dinner, but I might the next time I take a trip to Sin City.",

Agnes, refused to let us sit by the Windows claiming there was no open seats, when there clearly was. In fact the next three groups of people she took all got seated by the Windows. Instead we got seated in quite frankly the worst seats in the house. I was literally sitting in the main aisle right at the entrance/exit to the seating area so it was fun to get bumped into like twenty times. Her claim is that since it was before nine they weren't all the way open. Well if you open at seven you need to let people know you're not going to be ready to work at nine...or make up a better story Agnes. Watched her pull similar crap with several other parties as well. Aside from her basically being rude and nasty, the food had also gone way down in quality since the last time we were here. The ham was good, but easy staples like bacon and eggs were downright nasty. Salad bar accounts for about half of all items. It's not so bad if you can get a seat by the birds and stay awhile and have a few drinks, but I could barely eat seeing as I had to dodge other patrons coming right at me. We just up and left, wasn't worth our time. We had a whole morning/early afternoon planned at flamingo, but decided to go elsewhere after this experience.",

Finally got to the hostess desk 30 minutes later and then we had form ANOTHER line to be seated! So many lines, such a hungry stomach.  Wide varieties of breakfast/brunch items from yogurt and granola to eggs benedict. Everything was fresh, including the cocktail shrimp and crawfish, which sounds a tad bit weird for a morning meal. Service was pretty slow and we had piles of plates on the side of our table which made it difficult to put our new plates down. Can't leave the buffet without having some dessert! As my favorite part of the meal, I went hog wild and took a sample of each dessert item. The crepe is made to order, but nothing special (varieties of fruit \"preserves\", chocolate syrup, and whipped cream). The cannoli, soft serve ice cream cone and fondue were delicious, but the red velvet cookie wasn't something I was crazy about.  Very decent buffet, but definitely look out for coupons!",

The price was reasonable, especially considering you get bottomless mimosas included in the pricing. Brunch selections were decent, but there wasn't a whole lot to choose from. The good news is that everything they had was delicious and hot. We saw them changing out pans even if they weren't empty which makes you feel good about the safety and quality. The location is awesome, with a view outside to the flamingos and it's quite bright (anyone notice that most Vegas buffets seem so dark?). The Flamingo is our favorite hotel in Vegas and we will definitely be returning to the Paradise Garden Buffet on our next trip there.",

    "text": "One of Las Vegas' claims to fame are their buffets.  Long stations filled with anything that your heart desires...  Happy people taking pictures of food with their cell phones, and talking about how great their food is...  Other people clamoring around the various stations, excited to try something new or eat some of their old time favorites...  My experience at the this buffet however, was quite different.  I think everyone there was just looking around, wide eyed, and thinking to themselves \"that's it?\"  This place can't even compete with the comfort foods of a place like Hometown Buffet - and Hometown would charge you $5-$10 less!  My reviews are always relative to the level of service one would expect from a certain level of restaurant, and those that are comparable in the area.  For one of the most famous Las Vegas hotels, in the middle of the strip, a place like this has the cash flow to impress.  But impress they didn't!  Even the service we received was not up-to-par with the other buffets we went to.  I thought their salad area was very fresh (though extremely small), and they also have crab legs, and fresh carved ham.  I went during the brunch, so they also had breakfast items - the waffles were very cute, made of the various suits of playing cards (diamonds, clubs, etc.).    But other than that, I did not find anything really that appetizing.  Oh yeah and if you are dying from dehydration, make sure to try the scrambled eggs.  There was so much water in those things that I thought I was going to float away after eating them!    Come on Flamingo - you can do so much better!  SUGGESTIONS:  According to the Flamingo Las Vegas' Website:  \"Watch the playful antics of some of the Flamingo's wildlife while enjoying a fresh feast at the Paradise Garden Buffet.\"  What they fail to tell you on the website is that you are going to need binoculars to see those playful antics, as all the tables near the windows are reserved for the \"Platinum Club Members\", so if you are just here for the buffet, then you might as well forget about those playful antics.  Maybe you can make random bird calls in the restaurant, and start some playful antics of your own!",

It took about 45 minutes for us to get seated, and when we sat down they began to remove all the breakfast items and replace them with lunch!   WHAT! IT'S ONLY 10:30! WHO EATS BREAKFAST MUCH EARLIER THAN THAT IN LAS VEGAS?!?!?!  I was so disappointed. Now I had to change my entire idea of what i wanted to eat.
