    "text": "After getting tuned onto the deliciousness that is ramen during a stay in LA's Little Tokyo, I've been a hale and hearty adventurer on a vegetarian RamenQuestTM ever since!  The oft mentioned pinnacle of my quest here in Las Vegas is Miko's - who provide vegetarians with their own special menu featuring a vast variety of vegetarian rolls, udon, and yes - that most elusive of vegetarian dishes - ramen noodle soup that is not made with pork, beef or chicken broth.  MIko's did not disappoint!  The broth was deeply flavored and tasted like, well, like they craft their food with care and quality.  The noodles were thin and had great texture, while the veggies (which change from day-to-day from what I understand) mostly peas, spinach and asparagus this time - had been slightly roasted and caramelized then cooked until crisp tender. Perfect.  A friend ordered the vegetarian sukiyaki and it looked amazing - something new to try for next time.  The only minuses were the food took a really long time to come out of the kitchen - and the place wasn't that busy on a Sunday evening.  My husband ordered the Veggie Tempura roll and while he said it was tasty, it was one of those super large sliced rolls that is so loosely packed it's impossible to pick it up with just chopsticks, or your fingers for that matter, without it completely falling apart.  I didn't even try...  Overall I highly recommend Miko's to those on a veggie forage voyage.  A really, really nice stop-over on the RamenQuestTM journey.",

Miko's is Amazing.  A gem hidden in a random strip mall.  We've visited a couple fo times during dinner rush on the weekend.  They are always very busy, but we get seated quickly.   The service at Miko's is great.  Quick, wit the goal of getting you fed and happy as soon as possible.  You get edmame when you sit down and food never takes more than 15 minutes to come out.  The food is great.  We are noodle lovers so we have tried the soba, udon and a couple of ramens.  All are delicious.  Broth to die for.   They stopped their sushi take-out service to preserve the quality of their sushi.  The spicy scallop roll had the freshest scallop I have ever had on sushi before.  Their prices are incredibly reasonable and their happy hour is great.  Half off house Sake and cheap pints of Sapporo.  My favorite thing about Miko's is that Miko is in the kitchen, every time we are there.  It is family run by a family that cares about their food and their customers and it shows.  Super happy we found this place.  Well worth the five star rating.",

From the soft and silky, exceptionally fresh fish in the sushi to the perfect umami of the tonkotsu ramen, absolutely everything served here is bright, fresh and delicious. All their food is hand made with great care and skill. Anything you order here will be visually stunning and perfect in flavor. In addition, the portion sizes are perfect, too; in fact, some portions are larger than expected. I could not believe how huge their bowls of ramen are, especially given the modest prices. And I'm not sure, but I believe they make their own noodles; how else could they taste so incredibly tender and fresh..?  The service is outstanding; we were seated promptly, our order taken quickly and efficiently, the food brought quickly and piping hot. We were very well taken care of, never having to ask for water or anything. The owner himself came out to check on our meals, and talk to us a bit about the food; he was very kind and friendly, patiently answering our questions and making suggestions for our next meal (we assured him we would be having many, many next meals at his fantastic establishment).   Another great bonus? On Friday and Saturday, they're open until 12am. Fantastic! This is a terrific restaurant to wind down in after a long hectic day in Vegas. And it's near the airport, so you can enjoy a perfect meal before settling in for the flight home.   So from food to prices to service to location, for us, Miko's is simply 100% perfect.",

    "text": "Driving down E. Windmill Lane, we couldn't ignore the \"izakaya\" sign.  Spectacular reviews on yelp gave us the final push to check out this restaurant we've been so curious about.   Weekday evening and happy hour has just ended (5 pm to 7 pm), so we're seeing an 'interesting' mix of people hanging out at the sushi bar.  Upon seating, it's hard to ignore the menu because there is just so much to go through.  There's the Sushi and Sashimi menu, the \"You Pick\" Menu that includes Side Orders, the regular a la carte menu, the dinner combination menu, the Vegetarian menu, and the beverage menus.  After some careful perusing, we decided to go with items from the You \"Pick\" Menu, Pick 3 - $15.95; Pick 4 - $19.95; Pick 5 - $24.95.  The waiter suggested we do the Pick 4 since we planned on ordering other things as well.  * Wafu Yakiniku \"Tender sliced beef with Miko's special sauce.\" - Steaming plate of tender and juicy pieces of beef.  Pretty good.  * Shishamo \"Grilled roe capelin\" - Four pieces of smelt in this order.  * Sashimi \"Chef's choice of sliced raw fish\" - A nice selection of raw fish, about five large slices.  * Oyako-Don \"Topped with simmered chicken and egg\" - This dish arrived last.  It was a steaming bowl of chicken, onions, and scrambled egg on rice with sauce.  We were too full to enjoy this, so we packed it for home.  * Tonkotsu Ramen \"Ramen noodles and pork flavored soup.  Served with Miko's Gyoza\" ($9.50) - Looking quite pretty with it's hard-boiled egg, fish cake, and vegetable greens floating on top, the soup looked pretty authentic.  However, the tonkatsu wasn't quite what we expected.  We're used to pork cutlet that's been breaded and fried, and this wasn't the case.  There was pork in the soup, but not what we know as tonkatsu.  (Maybe they got the order wrong?)  The gyoza was also a bit different - it's completely deep-fried and looks more like a flattened eggroll than a gyoza. (Update!  Candace C. was so nice to point out that tonkotsu ramen is actually a pork bone broth ramen, so that was our mistake that we were expecting tonkatsu - the deep fried pork cutlets!  See how one letter can change what you're expecting! At least now we know!)  * Agedashi Tofu \"Fried tofu in special broth\" ($3) - The lone block of tofu was more fried than I hoped, and there wasn't much of a broth.  It was more like a light sauce on the bottom.  Beyond the food, we couldn't help but notice the dynamics of the staff.  Sure, it definitely seemed like it was bit understaffed as the owner's husband was the waiter and busboy for the evening.  We also noticed one lone sushi chef and a prep cook behind the sushi bar.  The latter two were not the most professional using language like \"asshole\", etc. from behind the sushi bar and hollering up to the front.  I also found it weird that the girl who was hanging out at the sushi bar when we arrived eventually went behind the sushi bar to help out.  (Maybe she works there?  Her purse and phone were still by her seat.)  Service was a bit slacking, only because Miko's husband was responsible for front of the house and he was alone.  We did have to ask for plates, refills, etc.  He did bring us complimentary miso soup though before our meal, which was a nice touch.  Before we left though, he chatted with us a bit and told us more about his wife's restaurant.  Having opened in September of 2008, they were doing quite well.  Then with the struggling economy, they have since expanded their menu to accommodate more diners and their various likings. A 65 year old Japanese chef overseas the kitchen and the recipes are authentic Japanese ones.  However, with the younger staff up front, they do maintain a different image for the younger crowd and dominates this restaurant and has pretty much taken over the sushi bar.  I'm torn, I want to like this place for what it stands for and where it came from.  But I was turned off by the antics of the kitchen staff.  When I'm looking for more authentic Japanese home cooked food, this place would be a good consideration.  I think they need to work on getting the food out at the proper times too.",

    "text": "So being Japanese, and a flexible Vegetarian.. I was real excited to visit this place because many people said that they had many vegetarian food. It was NOT one of those places that made me want to come back though unfortunately.  Just because your food is vegetarian, does not mean that it has to be over priced. I ended up spending much more than my regular spending for japanese food, and leaving the place not so full.  I liked their traditional appetizers like Hijiki and Goboo. Their green bean miso was a bit too small, and i think it would taste better with the traditional spinach because the miso sauce can't soak into the green beans. I got a vegetarian roll that cost the same as a roll with fish, and that got me furious because i didn't realize the price until later. (i don't usually look at the price because i'll pay for good food) but a roll with avocado, pineapple, spinach, should be like 5 dollars ut it was 12 dollars and the ingredients aren't even organic so why the high cost?!@#$  My boyfriend ordered the salmon shioyaki which is just plain salmon grilled with light salt. You can't really go wrong with grilled fish, but i didn't like how long it took the company to make it because that was the last thing that came.  For dessert we had Japanese cream puffs and fried bananas. Again, you can't go wrong with friend bananas. The Cream Puffs were on the \"today's special\" so i thought maybe they were the fluffy big ones like the ones in Japan but they were the tiny ones you could probably buy at sams. I know they were japanese because it tasted the same but i didnt' like the whole presentation with just whipped cream... wasn't very attractive and it wasn't anything special. Other than that the service was great and the food tastes overall good. IT just isn't a place for me to want to drive over and eat or crave their food again. Sorry.",

    "text": "Skip the strip for sushi - Miko's is miles better.   My wife and I were searching for sushi in Vegas on our honeymoon, and amongst the various uber high priced sushi places in the various casinos we stumbled across Miko's on Yelp.   It ended up being so good that we went twice during our five day stay.  The restaurant is a few minutes away from the main Vegas strip in an unassuming strip mall. The best way I can describe the atmosphere is a well lit neighborhood bar. The sushi chef (I think his name is Yoshi) seemed to know everyone that walked in and was overall a pretty happy guy, chatting it up with anyone who wanted to. There's a large list of special sushi rolls (ask if you don't know what they are!) as well as other sorts of specials.   The first time we went, my wife and I both got Ramen. She got the Miso Ramen, I got the Pork. Hers was way better initially (although mine was not bad by any stretch of the imagination) but after some soy sauce and spices it was very, very tasty.   A couple days later we came back to try the sushi, which is what people initially raved about on Yelp. The raving is VERY well deserved. The second time we had Miko for a waiter, and he was very useful in helping us choose some different rolls and sashimi to try. We ended up having a spicy tuna roll, some sashimi with cilantro and jalapeno, the Yoshi roll, and a roll I think they call \"baked salmon\" or something like that. Everything was incredible, melt in your mouth smooth and while I've never thought about eating cilantro with sushi before it is definitely something I would do again. My suggestion, ask your waiter or the chef what's good and you won't be disappointed. My wife and I are very sad we live so far away because we would definitely become very regular customers.   I've had sushi in New York City that wasn't this good.",

The specialty roll menu is extremely limited so if you're looking for a variety of different rolls, this place isn't for you. Also, slightly overpriced compared to neighboring sushi joints.",

It is a family owned Japanese restaurant, staffed by the family. (Closed sunday and monday) very clean, friendly atmosphere. A few booths, a dozen seats at the bar and a few tables make up the seating. It is a small venu.  (Some of our other sushi spots include yama, oyshi, i love sushi) Edemame and wet wipes to start the meal. Chefs specials are written on the white boards on the wall in the kitchen. (Ask your server for a description of the rolls) We went in for sushi and did not have any entrees.  The garlic tuna sashimi melted in our mouths, the ichi roll was awesome; cami roll (riceless) was refreshing, hawaiian roll was unique - with pineapple, hawaiian tuna and a coconut sauce, japanese lasagna was standard and delicious. I was surprised by the pickled wasabi condiment - delish as a nibble or on top of fish or rolls. Yum! We also tried the dynamite - wonderful and without mayo or cheese!!! Staff was friendly, prompt and helpful.  I am big on good tasting water - it is good. (Def not tap!!!) We ended the meal with a japanese ice cream sandwich - a nice compliment to the meal (3 adults shared 1, with some to spare!) They do not serve sushi at lunch (11-230) only at finner (after 5).",

The calamari was crunchy and not too chewy.  The sauces went perfectly with the octopus and the calamari.  We also got the ramen and the chicken yakisoba.  They were both delicious.  The only thing is that they don't have sushi at lunch.  So don't come for lunch if you are expecting sushi because they only serve sushi at dinner.  That was okay though because everything else was yummy.  Overall, I think this is a great place to go to if you are looking for some good food.",

It's a quintessential sushi neighborhood restaurant and I have no doubt you will enjoy your food and service. The owners are Greg and Miko, she cooks, he serves and no doubt they will be here any night you come in for dinner.  I'm from Vegas but also enjoy a local place. I'm not going to say the atmosphere will blow you away and they have rolls but it's not about those as much as it is the fresh fish, (sashimi and nigiri) teppan beef, ramen, and udon. So enjoy and the sparkling flavored sake called banzai bunny is the biz!",

I got the cold one with ginger sauce on the appetizer menu and I think it may be the tastiest cold tofu I've ever had. It had great flavor.   I love this place because of the extra details they accomplish to keep me happy.   M got the sushi sampler for dinner and said it may have been the freshest raw fish he'd ever enjoyed.

There are also non-sushi vegetarian items and, as a bonus, the miso soup at Miko's is vegan (and delicious, I might add).  Another nice thing about Miko's is that they use organic tofu and miso. I'm sure this is reflected in the price, but I greatly prefer my tofu to be organic. Don't you?  The proprieter of Miko's, Greg, is knowledgeable about vegetarianism and veganism, and understands the difference. He knows exactly which items are vegan and which are only vegetarian.  I would tell you my favorite roll and suggest you try it, but I like them all. Try any of them that look good to you and you won't be disappointed.  I can't speak to the rest of the menu (which is what most of you are interested in, I'm sure), but I can tell you that if you're a sushi lover with a vegetarian or vegan friend, this is the spot to bring them. They'll have lots of good options.",

The curry is amazing and the chicken katsu is awesome! I like the fact that they use chicken breast and the breading is light yet very crispy. Currently, it's my favorite dish! The uni was fresh and melted in my mouth.   As usual, I ordered my raw seafood (this time the Sushi Dinner) and the fish was in good condition and big portions! I shared some pieces with the husband and our friends but it was still a lot! We also tried the Agedashi tofu (so-so), the Gyoza (delicious, homemade dumplings), Yaniku-Don (so-so), and Lychee ice cream (tart but sweet and refreshing, a great way to end your meal).   In addition to all the food we ordered, I still loved (and always finish) their complimentary edamame sprinkled with coarse salt, salad (the lettuce is fresh, green, and crisp), and miso soup with tofu and noodles. We also made it to the tail end of happy hour so we were able to get 2 rounds of draft Sapporo and Kirin for only $2.00/pint!  Seriously, the curry and chicken katsu was so awesome that I have to give them 5 stars today!",

I ordered their yakiniku don, which reminded me a lot of bulgogi. My friend ordered their salmon teriyaki which was a nice cut of salmon in my opinion. I really don't know what to think of this place honestly. Their food was great, service friendly and prompt, prices were a little steep for my pocket (college student) but you do pay for quality here. I guess I'm not completely in love due to the fact that it's pretty far from where I live, so you won't be seeing me coming back anytime soon :( but if I'm in that side of town, I'll definitely eat here again!  *I sound so conflicted lol",

    "text": "You know the kind of meal that lingers on your tongue and you never want to eat again because you want that taste forever? This is the real deal. I've been coming here for the ramen and loving it for a long time. But tonight, I put myself in Greg (owner)'s hands and let him pick some stuff. ZOMG! Seriously,t his was one of the best meals I've ever had. I'd put this place up against Nobu in a heartbeat, but the price is about 1/3 less. I was adventurous tonight and ate things I might not normally eat.  Greg (owner) chooses fish based on season. He's closed on Monday because he doesn't want to serve old fish. And not all of his selections can be obtained at any old time. Right now, monkfish liver is in season. I was a little scared but willing to try. The taste was like the ocean but not salty. Like lazing in an ocean inlet. The flavors were relaxing, not inyerface. Very clean. Hints of butter and ocean. This is a winter seasonal dish and it's delightful. Another delight was the halibut sushi....sliced very thin. Long plush finish. I didn't want to finish my sake because I didn't want the taste to leave my mouth, ever. Kampachi sushi, so clean that even pregnant women can eat it due to near zero (or zero) mercury levels, danced on my palette.  The sushi chef is 3rd generation and takes pride in picking only the best fish.  The owner and staff take great pride in their food. And this is as it should be. If you can do it, give the owner your budget, your hunger level, and tell him if you have any food allergies. Then let him delight you. You won't be disappointed!  ETA: Dare I suggest that if you don't like the food here, perhaps you're ordering the wrong thing. This is a Japanese restaurant run by Japanese people. The best food on the menu is Japanese food. All those weird combo rolls? Those are American....or maybe arguably Korean. Get those in a Korean run Japanese restaurant. Here? Stick with the authentic menu and be authentically delighted. Just came back from stuffing myself with hamachi kama, best miso soup I've ever had, todiefor albacore sashimi, on and on. Yum! If I die with these tastes on my mouth, I die a bit happier.",

All the tables were taken so we waited about 15 minutes for a table to open up.  When we finally got seated, it took a while to get our drink order and then quite a while until we got our items ordered.  After placing our order, it took about 30 minutes to be served.  They were not complicated items.  I ordered their Vegetarian Yakisoba and my partner ordered a vegetarian sushi roll.  My dish came out first and the veggie roll took another 10 minutes to get there.  I don't know what the hold up was considering most people were not having sushi and we placed the order 30 minutes ago.  My partner was a bit disconcerted because  we loved their veggie rolls before.  This was not up to par from our previous experience.  My yakisoba was awesome.  As I said we are still a big fan of Miko's.  They just need to streamline their service when they are packed.",

When I finally got a hold of someone, I asked if they were open & I was told that they were packed and busy. I asked if I could order for pick-up and the answer I got shocked me. I was told that they were TOO BUSY TO TAKE MY ORDER! I was furious & asked the guy if he was serious that he couldn't take my order because they were too packed and busy in house and couldn't take a minute to stop and take my order!!! So then I told him that he just lost a customer! It's too bad because I really like their food but being turned down for service due to the fact that they were busy is absolute bullshit! I've never been turned down just because the business is busy/packed! If it's too busy or packed, may I suggest to them HIRE MORE EMPLOYEES then! Don't take it out on the customers who are obviously not that important, especially the ones that are calling in for take out! I will definitely NEVER go back since my business is not welcomed nor wanted because they are just too busy to take an order over the phone!",

    "text": "I found this place through Yelp as I was planning three summer trips to Vegas.  Based on the nearly-5 star rating, I told myself I HAVE to work my itinerary around to be able to try this place.  My party arrived on a Friday September early evening and the place was nearly empty.  Considering the fact that we arrived on an early summer evening, the service was not A+ but maybe more of a B-.  A middle-aged gentleman (Miko's husband?) served us and could tell right off the bat that we were visiting from out of town.  And maybe that's why he didn't deliver that 5-star service.  Anyway, we ordered early bird specials, sashimi and sushi and we really were not impressed with taste, freshness or quality of service.    This place did not strike me as extraordinary.  I was NOT impressed by Miko's Izakaya's quality, taste or service.     Maybe I'm used to the multitude and variety of Japanese restaurants and izakayas in LA.  And based on the majority of Miko's reviews, it's according to Vegas locals' standards.  At least I can now understand why Miko's can be a 4-or-5-star restaurant based on Vegas standards.  So if you come from a major metropolitan area with plenty of choices in terms of Japanese fare , I would say DON'T BOTHER.",

    "text": "The \"izakaya\" sign really stands out. I'm so excited to get there and see what they have to offer. The place is kind of small. They have like 4 separate menus. I still never understand why would people put their menu separately. Do you really want to hold 4 different menus in your hand?  Their vegan menu is quite impressive, even though I didn't get to try any of their vegetarian food, but I will definitely come here to try it if I'm a vegan.   While I'm looking at their appetizers, I thought they have a pretty good selections of appetizers. The price is pretty normal for izakaya, the amount you get is pretty good as well. But when I'm looking at their ala carte menu, I kind of feel a little bit expensive, especially for a small place like this. Their combination dinner is a better value. It almost seems like they don't want you to order the single entree, seems like they want the customer to order the combination dinner.    After looking at the menu for 15 minutes, I finally go for their Chirashi special. It's $15.95, the chirashi bowl comes with tempura on the side. The owner is nice enough to let me substitute the the tempura with soft shell crab. Sounds like a pretty good deal. But actually I'm not that impressed. I'm supposed to get 4-5 pieces tempura (based on the picture), instead I get a small soft shell crab as a substitute. I asked for the substitute, so can't really complain about it. The fish is fresh, but I wish it would have more than that. I've had a chirashi bowl in the past that is more than just 5-6 type of fish put on top of a sushi rice. The soft shell crab itself is pretty good, I wish they didn't put the sweet teriyaki-like sauce on it though. It was pretty small, but maybe it's part of the deal.   Overall is a good experience. The entree is a little expensive for a small restaurant. It wouldn't feel expensive if it's a fine dining restaurant, but it's not.   Will i be back? Yes. But I won't be too crazy if someone inviting me to go there.   Food taste & quality - 4 stars Value - 2 stars Customer service - 5 stars Atmosphere - 3 stars.   It definitely has the potential to be a 5 stars restaurant. It only have a little things to be fixed. But for now I will give it a 3.5 stars, round up to 4 stars.",

Having said that, Mikos would prefer to close down once a year for vacation (everyone deserves one), instead of handing the business to someone who doesn't care about the rock solid foundation that this business has formed in just three short years. Mikos has been closed for the past eight days (re-opens 6/26) and yes the regulars do go into withdrawls while they are closed, but I would rather eat with family than with strangers, so I'm willing to wait. They posted signs more than a month ago informing everyone that they would be closed. I know this doesn't help first time customers, but to give it a one star rating when the food hasn't been tasted is petty.  If you love great food, good prices and service with a smile try Mikos.....you will not be disappointed.",

    "text": "Hmmm.  Let me see..... If the TV series \"Cheers\" were ever broadcast in Japan, odds are they would need to rename it to \"Miko's\".    Essentially that's what I took away from my first experience here. You take the \"Cheers\" bar and tack on some of the best \"real\" Japanese eats you can get without a passport and 'boom', you get Miko's.  Here is what you can expect on a maiden voyage to Miko's.  1. Miko's is Japanesey (is that a word?).  This is a may seem like a no-brainer but you may notice that there are Japanese people working here.  I know!  Maybe it's me but I have found that many of the Japanese places I have frequented in the past rarely have any Japanese people in their employ.  Cool thing at Miko's is that the owner, Greg, he's Japanese. Miko, his wife?, Japanese. Same goes for the sushi chef and the master preparing the hot foods.  Japanese people serving up Japanese cuisine in a Japanese restaurant? Brilliant!  2. This place is a Mom and Pop joint. Expect to catch Mom and Pop there greeting customers, serving drinks, bussing tables, etc.   On my first visit Greg the owned had me bellied up to the sushi bar and offered me a beer.  I usually get an Asahi but Greg informed me that he had Kirin on tap.  When I asked if the on tap Kirin was better than the Asahi he replied \"You tell me.\" And he bought me one.  Class act.  The place just has that good vibe that puts you in a good place.  People seem more sociable and on more than one occasion I've been there where an entire bar of strangers suddenly is engaged in conversation and camaraderie. Maybe it's the effect of good food, however I think the great beer and flow of sake has a good bit to do with it as well.  3. Japanese Food.  Miko's is not an all you can eat sushi restaurant.  You'll taste that in the quality of the fish, you'll see it in the preparation of the food.  Got something in mind you don't see on the menu? Ask. The masters behind the counter have been plying their trade for a while now.  You want it, they'll make it.  Great sushi is reason enough to make Miko's your home base for raw fish but the great sushi shares it spotlight with a hot foods menu that is equally impressive. So impressive that I have had great internal struggles to see where my food allegiance lies.  Do I fill up on sushi? Or should I abandon the raw in favor of a \"Pick 3\"? This scenario has occurred more than once.  Miko's Hot Menu includes the \"Pick\" menu.  The most popular being the Pick 3.  The combinations are incredible and to vast to list but here is my pick three.  J-Recca's Pick 3 First Pick : Unagi KabaYaki  Second Pick : Hamachi Kama  Third Pick : Salmon Butter Yaki   So there ya go.  Miko's. The official haunt of J-Recca. Odds are pretty good if you come late you might catch me at my favorite past time.  Holding up the end of the bar.",

We were kinda driving aimlessly while trying to choose a restaurant for dinner when we pulled into the complex to come here. I was so glad to hear a Japanese accent when the host seated us. (Non-Japanese owned/run Japanese restaurants are a big pet peeve.) it was also nice to see the host recognize and acknowledge regulars coming in for dinner. The menu items were pretty standard but well priced. Appetizer portions weren't huge, but perfectly enough for a party of 3. The guys both got ramen which were great. Good broth flavor and great noodle texture. I ordered the 11 piece sashimi side as my dinner and it was a beautiful plate of fresh fish! The chef was very generous and I don't know if that's normal but because of it, I will definitely come back. The service was very good. Our waitress was very sweet. So, all in all, why wouldn't this place get 5stars? See you again next visit, Miko!",

This is one of the few sushi restaurants in Vegas that is Japanese owned and has a Japanese sushi chef, and they are clearly very proud of their Japanese heritage and it shows in the quality of the food.  The homemade gyoza is the best I've ever had, and some of their other dishes (such as the beef tongue) are far better than you'd ever expect to find in a sushi restaurant.  That said, this is a place for people who love Japanese sushi - not American rolls.  There are other sushi restaurants that will sell you rolls cheaper than Miko's does, because they use lower-quality fish.  The truth is there's no point in using quality fish if you're just going to stuff it in a roll and cover it in a bunch of sauces.  Miko's is very reasonably priced compared to other sushi restaurants that offer the same caliber of sushi.",

It is located in a cute and intimate restaurant with lots of parking. It has a nice and warm feel to the restaurant compared most chain restaurants.

The food is authentic and the staff is caring and honest. This combines to make up a place you would easily find in Gardena or Torrance but very hard to find in Las Vegas. The prices are reasonable and the portions are sufficient. We were at our annual basketball tournament and after doing the M Resort Buffet, Blue Man Group and the Outlet Malls, we were ready for a touch of home. That's what Greg and h is wife gave us. We'll make sure we stop by on our next visit.   We were staying near the South Point at the Grandview so it was very easy to get to, just take LV Blvd north to Windmill and make a right, go down a mile or so and it is on the left side of the street.",

Well the food here is great quality and the price is great. If you go during happy hour he doesn't cut you off because the time ran out. He doesn't want to do all you can eat because it takes away from the quality of the food. It is a mom and pop restaurant and they do a great job.

    "text": "I went there with a friend after shopping at the outlet mall. We don't live in the area but, were very hungry & saw the sign that said sushi & Izakaya.    The restaurant was pretty busy, it was prime time on Friday. We were greeted by a young Asian female, who brought us a complementary edamame & who promptly took our drink order told us about the happy hour specials & the enticing flavoured sakes that the restaurant  had. She seemed to be knowledgeable about alcohol, unlike other sushi restaurants, where the waiters/waitresses just take your orders. It was a pleasurable surprise, like she was a Sake & beer Somelier. If we didn't have elsewhere to go, we would've indulged in a bottle of sparkling blueberry sake.     We asked her if it was a AYCE & she explained that the owners feel that if they do ACYE they compromise on quality. They want their guest to have the best fish & protein they can provide which they wouldn't be able to do as an ACYE. Which makes sense. She showed us a couple of items on the menu.  The vegetarian menu that was surprisingly big & a couple of her favorites. She also suggested to us, when we were going to order only sushi, that We might want to order some Izakaya menu items because the Sushi chef had a lot of people on his counted & she was worried that We might have a wait. So we ordered the  Kama, the neck part of yellowtail fish &  chicken kaarage, fried chicken marinated in a sauce. We also ordered Sushi items.    When the Kama came it was a huge piece & so delicious! The meat fell off off the bone & was very tender. The kaarage was dark & we thought it was over cooked but it tasted very good. And Kris, our waitress was right with her suggestions. And the Sushi that we ordered was fresh & presented nice. The sushi rice tasted perfect. It wasn't too vinegary.  I wish I took pictures but we were hungry & forgot. LOL.    Kris came to our table a couple of times to check on us during each course & make sure our food was good. She never let our drinks go lower than halfway & used a tray. She was extremely polite & funny. She did tell us in the beginning  that it was her training week & therefore didn't know all of the items just yet, but if we could be patient would answer all of our questions. We were surprised when she told us that because she was very professional & seemed like a  polished professional server who had been doing her job a long time. She could teach some of those waiters on the strip how to serve.     There was another older woman with a nice smile who came to our table to pick up dirty dishes but didn't seem to have the polish that our waitress had. She took care of a table in front of us but just took the drink order, then the food order. She seemed like a nice older lady but, didn't have the finesse our server had. There was a big difference in the quality & style of service. Kris's style seemed like she belonged in a Strip Hotel. She had a nice shirt on,  looked & acted polished. The other server wore a old tee shirt & faded jeans. She didn't use a tray, which in is done in every bar & restaurant, just took the order, dropped the food & dropped the check. There was a big difference.   That was the only critique that I  could say other than the busboy shouldn't take a bus tub around the tables to clear dishes. It's kind of loud when the dishes are crashing in the tub & dirty. They need to train him on clearing tables with guests still eating without the bus tub.    We will be coming back to visit Kris when we are on that side of town. The food was awesome & our. server was perfect!",

I was station in Japan while in the US Marines, and felt in love with sushi.  this sushi was one of the best I had.

The tempura plate was pretty decent! The gyoza was average as well, and the dipping sauce that comes with that is way too salty in my opinion. Our meal was $35 ish before tip for somewhat average food. I could have gotten similar food from a teriyaki spot for half of that price and with better taste. I was expecting a lot when I came here but didn't leave feeling satisfied. Maybe their other foods would have changed my perception of the place.",

I could see that the chef behind the counter knew what he was doing and obviously had a lot of creativity. Nice service. It seemed that maybe the owners were in there working the dining area. The only thing I could see that might be a negative is they seemed slightly short staffed at the sushi bar, but then again it was a weekday so maybe they didn't figure for a lot of people.  Food was good though, sushi high quality, specials were all on point. I will definitely be coming here again.",

    "text": "How could anyone of Japanese lineage give this place more than 3 stars?  This place is completely marketed and designed for Westerners. When you walk inside all you see are: White folks, Hawaiians, and a random Korean guy sitting in back.  There were absolutely  no one of Japanese descent eating here.  Before I write my review, let me tell you a personal story about my Dad. Everyone from Hawaii will tell you stories about that one Japanese family who lived on their street who absolutely refused to assimilate to Hawaiian culture. They didn't speak in that \"Wakki Lakki talk\", hated saying Aloha, refused to call their brothers: \"brah-duh\", and thought surfing was the sport of idiots. These Japanese men raised their kids in a traditional Japanese style. And, that was how my Dad was raised. So, he knows good Japanese food when he sees it. My Dad came to Miko's about 2 years ago and hated it so much that he called me and told me never to come here. I didn't believe him back then because my Dad literally hates everything for no reason. He even hated Urusawa(the most famous sushi bar in LA), and got into a fight with the chef. So, when I walked in Miko's today, I had totally forgotten everything he had told me about this place. For the first time in my life, I actually agree with my Dad on something. This place wasn't a Japanese restaurant.    When I first walked in, I stood at the front desk for about 5 minutes before anyone even said \"hi\" to me. The man working here(who looked like he was half white and half Hawaiian-Japanese) was too busy kissing the asses of the regular customers to even bother seating me. The regular customers here get all the priority. Even if they order 15 minutes after you order, they will get their food before you do.   When I was finally sat, it took him another 5 minutes to come back over and take my order. And after he dropped my bowl of Ramen off, he never came back over again. This whole time I was here, he was acting lazy and having fun with all his regular customers.  Some places use a Tonkotsu base for their Miso Ramen, while  most places use a chicken bone base. Miko's Izakaya uses water mixed with a powder.   The 2 slices of Narutomaki were nothing more than generic prepackaged \"swirl\" fish cakes you buy at Greenland Market. It's a product of South Korea.  The hanjuku egg was nothing more than just a hard boiled egg with no soy sauce. And the egg was VERY hard boiled.   The Charsiu tasted like it was made days in advance. It didn't even taste like pork. It tasted like an oven roasted piece of dried out turkey.   The Miso Ramen's broth tasted 100% identical to Nissan Ramen's Instant Miso Flavor, which you can buy at both Greenland Market and Japan Creek.  If you want good Ramen in Las Vegas, go to places like Ramen Sora, Shuseki, Yagyu Yakinku. Anime Ramen has not been the same since Ryosuke went back to Japan, but it's still far superior to the instant cup of noodles you get at Miko's.   This was a 1-star experience. The food was 1-star, and the service was 1-star. The only reason I am giving this place another star is because when I was leaving, the Sushi Chef(a True full-blooded Japanese man) tried to get my attention.  He then gave me a certain unique look which I remembered from my youth with my Dad. While I was eating, I did notice the look of concern that the traditional Japanese Chef had on his face when he noticed I was being ignored. Traditional Japanese men do not have to use words to express their feelings of regret. When I was walking out the door, he let me know with facial expressions and body language that he felt it was wrong that I was treated so badly. I thought it was a kind gesture.",

    "text": "You'll go gaga for the gyoza at Miko's Izakaya Sushi and Tapanese restaurant on Blue Diamond and Windmill. The hospitable owner of the restaurant makes them herself, surprising you by using turkey rather than pork. I'm doubtful that turkey is traditionally used in gyoza, but Miko made me think that it must be so I guarantee you won't miss the oink one bit. The flavors of the meaty morsels were clean with mild accents of ginger and soy, and the chewy noodle exterior reminded me more of thick flat Chinese noodles than wonton wrappers. The friendly old man in her culinary team of four steamed and crisped them for me, then served them with a soy dipping sauce. I'll be back for these very soon ($5).  The gyoza aren't the only redeeming dish on the menu by any means. The thick slices of hamachi I ordered were expertly cut by the seasoned sushi chef (he's worked in some noteworthy places and used to write a sushi blog) and imbued with that subtle, delicate fish flavor you want from your sashimi. Since I was by myself I loved that I could order it in a mini portion of it - three beautifully garnished perfect pieces ($5.25).  I completed my sampling with an order of lightly battered shrimp and vegetable tempura ($5) that were served with a dashi broth rivaling that of Raku. The portion was large for the price and I the combination of veggies accompanying the shrimp were more flavorful and prepared better than at other places offering the same thing.  Everything I had made me want to come back to try more of her creations, and it's certainly a place you can eat well at on a budget. They offer half orders of all their rolls that start at $3.75, appetizer portions of many items, and, if you get there before seven you can take advantage of half price sake and Japanese beers on tap.",

We ordered our sushi and waiter, which I'm guessing is owner, told my husband, \"have to get this order in, or you will never get your food.\" We then get our food which wasn't satisfying so I proceed to ask about the Ahi Poke and if they have a small size. He replied with, \"no we only have a big one and there's 18 orders ahead of you.\" Who says that?   We left and I wrote a letter of feedback that hopefully will give them a clue and 1) food not good 2) service not good 3) not clean 4) who refuses additional orders and 5) just rude as they clear and wipe table while I'm eating!!!!

Greg and Miko warmly welcomed me, and when they learned I was engaged, I got cold unfiltered sake on the house!  yum.   My meal consisted of the long-awaited spicy tuna bowl with soft shell crab on top, nimono, and saba sashimi, plus matcha iced tea (surprise, surprise). The bowl: soooo good, fulfilled my cravings.  The soft shell crab was very crispy and tasty, but not greasy at all.  This was served beautifully with cucumbers, masago, lemon slices, and daikon. The nimono: This is basically Japanese comfort food.  Daikon, carrot, potato, taro, fish cake, and maybe burdock cooked in dashi-esque broth.  Warm, soft, delish... The saba: Cured to perfection, delicate but flavorful, cut by the master.  I ate the daikon and the perilla leaf too. The tea and sake: satisfying counterbalances :) and yes, it was packed in there fairly late on a Thursday! Look for an upcoming UYE one of these days, super-vegetarian-friendly!",

Honestly, I feel like I should give it 1 star, just to balance out the other inflated ones, but I suppose that's not fair...  Ambiance: 3/5 standard mediocre asian joint feel. nothing special.   Service: 2/5 friendly, but slow.  Food:  OK, let me start off by saying Miko's Izakaya is a gross misnomer. There's maybe 5 dishes that can be considered izakaya. This place just does a little bit of every Japanese food familiar to Americans.  -Yakitori: 3/5 Ordinary -Kushiyaki: 4/5 This was actually pretty good. good seasoning -Agedashi tofu: 3/5 Ordinary -Ika Sugatayaki: 3/5 Ordinary -Miko's Gyoza: 1/5 Not the absolute worst gyoza I've had but limp and not tasty...but definitely below average. My microwaved trader joe's gyozas taste better -Soft Shell Crab: 2/5 slightly worse than ordinary -Tonkotsu Ramen: 3/5 broth is definitely on the watery side for Japanese ramen. The saving grace was that the salt level was good -Miso Ramen: 2/5 below average -Shoyu Ramen: 1/5 This one just sucked.  I think I'm actually upset with Yelp for misleading me to this place. I have not had Yelp fail me this miserably in a very long time. I went w/ two other people. We unanimously agreed without hesitation that we will not be returning to this place",

When we came in, they practically had the meal ready for us, and it was PERFECT. Definitely going back. Good sake, good sushi, and fantastic customer service, what can be better?",

    "text": "One word describes this place, INCREDIBLE! My friends and I drove by and my friends suggested that we go here, I asked if it was AYCE and they replied no. I responded with 'I only do AYCE' (fat kid in me). Well, AYCE or not, this place is..well INCREDIBLE.  So my group of friends and I went on a Saturday night, I was the last one to arrive and my friends had already ordered appetizers. We ate a lot that night, so I'll review on what I remember.  Sunomono Beef Tongue-AMAZING! Thats all I have to say. It was cooked to my liking and very flavorful!  Edamame Hiyayakko (Cold tofu)  Ika Sugatayaki(grilled squid)- I've had this at Ichiza, and let me tell you, the grilled squid here is grilled to perfection. It wasn't under or over cooked. a MUST if you love squid!  Hamachi Kama  Salmon Collar  Manila Clam (special that night)-this was so good that we ordered two! The broth was awesome!  Shoyu Ramen Tonkotsu Ramen For the ramen, my friends said it was better than other ramen that they have had in Vegas. I'm not really a ramen fan cause I've experienced ramen that was too salty, and bland but to my surprise it was really good   Sashimi-GET IT! I don't remember what we ordered cause we had a lot, and they also give, wait for it....fresh wasabi! a MUST if you visit here.  We also ordered a couple of rolls, that were ok, I don't remember the names but they were delicious.  The service here was great! They made sure that our water and teas were filled to the brim. The owners are super friendly and make sure everything is ok. My friends and I had a lengthy conversation with them a little past closing time. My friends were driving back to CA that evening and he offered them some tea, when my friends didn't have a thermos, he gave them a couple boxes of pocky!  I highly suggest this place, it is a must!",

Reasonably priced sushi but some of the main cooked dishes are overpriced.  That might be to push people towards the more profitable sushi.  The dining room is sterile, cold, and small.  This seems like it's geared to be more of a lunch spot.  We came for dinner pretty early, 5pm, and by the time we left an hour later there was only one other table filled.  The owners work here and are very attentive.  That being said, one of our \"cooked\" dinners took 40 minutes to come out due to the first one being overcooked (steak dish).  Stick to sushi, come for lunch, and don't be in a hurry.",

Everything was still delicious.  While they didn't have it on the menu, they were happy to prepare a vegetable yakisoba for my vegetarian friend. She was absolutely floored by how delicious her noodles were.   I, however, was in much more a sushi mood. I went for the sushi/sashimi dinner combo. I seriously have never tasted fish so fresh in my entire life. The yellow fin was definitely the highlight of the place- it melted in my mouth like a slice of butter. It still tasted fresh and slightly salty, just like the ocean. True heaven.  Got to wash it all down with a ice cold Asahi. : ) The perfect accompaniment to any good japanese meal!  No seriously, this place is the bomb diggity. Please try it!",

While we had to drive a little ways to get from the strip (where we were staying) to Miko's, it was worth it.   I had the Miko roll, which was a pretty good size and very delicious. The guys had sashimi and our kid (2 1/2 yrs) had a never-ending supply of edamame (his favorite) and tried some fish and enjoyed the rice. I was happy that the place was tolerant of my kiddo when he was being grumpy and pleased when we walked in that there were already 2 other kids.   We called ahead and the owner set us up a \"reserved\" sign which was nice because the place isn't that big. He also came out when we were finishing up and asked how our meal was, very nice guy.   Great find, off the beaten path; we'll be back!",

The delivery was quick but we got our sashimi practically frozen. We had to wait 15 min for it to thaw. I wasn't really impressed with the quality of the sake salmon sashimi or the rainbow roll. It didnt seem very fresh. The California roll was as expected. Maybe dining in at the restaurant would've been a better choice. Willing to give them another try the next time I'm there.",

It was decent as far as broth and noodle content goes. What I liked the most was that the tempura shrimp was served on the side. Usually, it's served in the bowl and by the time you go to eat, it's soggy. I did like that a lot.   Biggest detraction is that it was $14 for udon. That seems crazy expensive. I appreciate the fact that it came with the other courses but it wasn't overall $14 good.   We did get the baked mussels in sauce. That was appropriately priced at $6 for 4 large mussels with the yum sauce. Very good.   Overall good but not great and the price has everything to do with it.. food quality is good and I would return.",

It is my favorite vegetarian sushi restaurant, and BEATS the Bay Area's Cha-Ya. I appreciate being asked every time if we are vegetarian or vegan and being directed to \"our\" special part of the menu!  If you are in the mood for ramen - this is place to be!! I have never not ordered the veggie ramen. Fantastic broth with kale and baby bok choy.  All of the veggie rolls are flavorful. I have cycled through the entire veggie roll menu and have never been disappointed.  Vegetarian miso is a plus! They are adding more organic vegetables to the current menu too!  Worth the 10 minute drive from the strip! Miko's is the only restaurant that I will not skip going to when I am in Vegas!!!",

Several other regulars came by to talk to Greg and he recognized and remembered them all.  I ordered vegan ramen and my boyfriend ordered vegan soba noodles.  Both were excellent and we ate it all.  The soba noodles had kale which I thought was a nice touch too.  When ordering beer, Greg asked what kind of beer we like, after my boyfriend explained his preference, Greg brought out the Angry boy ale- a Japanese micro beer.  This was perfect!  The meal, beer and service was excellent, Greg definitely made a huge difference in our dining experience and we will definitely return.  *check out Greg's paintings posted around the restaurant",

Happy Hour - From 5:00-7:00 pm, draft beer is 2.00 per glass/  Sopporo or Kirin.  To me that is a nice deal.  2.  Appetizers - Nice selection, however, because we had a large selection of food, we only ordered:  Ikageso - Haven't had squid legs like this at is was tender and just right. Gyoza - Turkey, very nice flavor, perfect heat.  Nice. Edamame - We did not order this, but they give it out automatically. Nice and simple.  3.  Main course - Came with salad, Miso Soup.  The Miso had a bit of thin vermicelli like noodles. Very nice.  Salmon - 7-8 ounces of salmon. Very nice.  Loved the perfectly grilled skin. Sashima - Wow, fresh, tender, and very tasty.  Served with freshly grated wasabi.  Absolutely wonderful.  4.  Desserts - Had the Mochi Ice Cream and Fried Banana.  The Mochi Ice cream is awesome.  5.  Next time I come back, I am going to order off their specials board.  They have quite a few specials!!!  GK says, check it out.",

A huge plus was when the owner personally came to our table and asked about our food. He seems to care about his customers because he became engaged in long conversations with a few other tables near by.   I got the sashimi and sushi combo. It came with 10 pieces of sashimi (tuna, yellowtail, and salmon), 5 pieces of nigiri and a California roll.   The sashimi and nigiri were so buttery and fresh I was in heaven. I usually don't care for California rolls, but I must say this one was exceptional, probably because there was real crab meat in it rather than imitation crab. It was all definitely enough food too because I ended up taking half the California roll home with me since I was completely full.   I would say this was definitely on par with a sashimi and sushi combo I had at an extremely popular sushi place in NYC. Except their combo was 40 while miko's was 26! Can't wait to come back here!",

I also ordered the sushi sashimi combo platter, which was served with a salad and miso soup. The green salad was nothing special, just iceberg lettuce with a French like dressing. However, this didn't take away from the overall high quality experience of dining here. The salad was light and a nice complement to the full meal I ordered. I ordered hot tea, although they have a nice beer, wine and sake selection. The tea was excellent and I never had to ask for a refill. Between the waiter and a waitress working the full restaurant (on a Tuesday!!!), my water and tea were always full and    I was never neglected. The food and service were both excellent.

    "text": "Quick look: Best & Most Authentic JAPANESE Restaurant in Vegas. Have been to many and I have not found a sushi restaurant as one as on-point as Miko's. It's my go-to spot and it has NEVER disappointed.   In depth review: Have held off on writing this review as it feels like my own secret hidden gem and I fear that too many good reviews will only create a buzz and over-run this small spot w/ annoying foodies. The owner Greg and his wife are of Japanese descent (rare as most sushi restaurants in vegas are Korean owned). Greg manages the front of house while his wife handles the kitchen duties. Greg is selective on who he serves and how he serves. People looking for the typical \"all you can eat\" sushi restaurants, take-out service or with small children should look elsewhere. Step out of line and insult his craft or staff and you could be politely asked to leave. With that said, he's really nice and they put a lot of love and detail into their service and food. You well feel at home at Miko's.   It is DINE-IN only and it is a small restaurant that has about a dozen tables of various size and a sushi bar with another dozen seats. They are closed on Sunday and Monday as the fish on these days is typically not at it's freshest locally. The menu consists of hot items that are old family recipes and a large sushi menu. The sushi is delicious, fresh and presented similar to the fancy restaurants on the strip (Nobu, Yellowtail etc.). The rice is real winner here. Really makes the difference and their rolls and Nigiri is top notch because of it. The new sushi chef is from a well known spot in China Town and certainly knows how to create and serve. It's an art that they take serious.   Have NEVER had a piece that had that \"fishy\" taste and it is always fresh and you can tell they use top quality fish. The service is spot on and you will not feel rushed.   I have been telling myself that one of these days I am going to order from the traditional menu and try some of the old family recipes. The issue is that the sushi is so delicious that I can help myself from ordering it. Always see a lot of Japanese clientele enjoying these dishes and one of these days I will ask Greg for some advice and try to skip the sushi. If that's possible...   Advice:  - Arrive early or go late, can get busy during traditional dinner hours - Look at the \"specials\" board and try them (you are in luck if they have Amberjack on the menu) - Order a cold Kirin Ichiban beer on draft (cold and delicious in a frozen mug) - Try some of the delicious warm Sake (has a nice kick) - Save room for desert, the traditional Japanese cream puffs are HEAVENLY",

    "text": "Real Japanese food by real Japanese people!  I think that I've found the jackpot of Japanese food in Vegas!  This little gem is tucked away on Windmill near the 215 exit (same plaza as the original Bachi burger). While I would not call this place a typical izakaya because of the menu offerings and portions are quite large so it more like Japanese family restaurant.   Here are a few key reasons why this place is at the top of my Japanese cravings list:  1. Fresh sushi You will not find old stinky fish here. I was told by Greg that they are closed on Sunday and Monday because there are no fish shipments into Vegas on the weekend.  2. Traditional and seasonal dishes They have nearly any Japanese dish that you could possibly crave from agedashi tofu, donburi, katsu to ramen. Miko's gyuzma (gyoza) were very good. Its very rare to see hand made gyoza served anywhere especially in the States. I am also surprised that they offer traditional seasonal dishes hot and cold soba. 3. Real Japanese cocoa puffs  No need for explanation on this one. Get it for dessert, you'll thanks me  4. Japanese craft beer Japan is not known for craft beers so needless to say I was delighted to find Japanese beer outside the big 4 Japanese  beer brands (5 is you're Okinawan)   It's safe to say that we will be going to see Miko anytime I'm craving something to eat from the motherland.  Umai to the max!",

As the evening wore on, the tables filled until there wasn't a spot in the place open.  The staff (assume the owners) were very friendly and attentive.  We were friends catching up and they left us alone but were also making sure we were taken care of.  We had the edamame (perfect), the tempura (very good), Kirin (always delicious), a couple of spicy tuna selections, and the miso soup.  Everything was better than expected.  I tried the sake (not to my liking but i don't care for it much anyway) and the green tea ice cream (yummy).",

That being said, I urge you to push aside those thoughts and try Mikos in Las Vegas, on Windmill Ln.  It is about 5 miles south of The Strip.  The food is fantastic and the service is second to none!   Yoshi is quite the character and makes sure that you are getting the best you can get.  This place has everything you can think of; from the basic California roll to things for the more adventurous eater.  I like to think that I fall into the latter category.  I tried the Jay's Ying Yang, which is actually the whole fish (a smelt) or two wrapped into a roll and served with a side of Ponzu; delicious!   Another one that I would consider a must-have is the Yoshi's Hot.  The uni shooter is fantastic as well.  This place obviously doesn't get a lot of tourists; however, it should!  So, the next time you are in Las Vegas, and you are looking for great sushi, get off The Strip and head down to Mikos!",

    "text": "I'm a huge, huge fan of miko's ramen here!!  By all means i am no ramen expert, but from my experience this is, hands down, the best spot to get Japanese ramen in town.  It's quite a journey, but the trip is well worth it.  The Shoyu Ramen broth is tangy, salty, and savory yet still fairly light on the palate which is quite enjoyable. Topped with fresh green veggies, bamboo shoots, fish cake, half an hard broil egg w/ a few piece of nicely done char siu. Really, really refreshing yet so simple.   The Miso Ramen is just as tasty, and not overpowering like the ones i had before.  I'm still not 100% sure what exactly am i supposed to be tasting in miso ramen but this is still phenomenal.   Tonkotsu Ramen:  My first time trying this because Greg, the owner, suggested it to me.  It's more of a thicker, milky broth since it's pork bone, fat, and collagen boiled in high heat for several hours.  Delish!  All ramen comes with 3 piece of turkey gyoza (dumplings).  Not a big fan of Gyoza, but it's still better than decent.  Agedashi Tofu was lightly fried, set on a nice light sweet sauce, and garnish with ginger and scallions.  Tempura has a good batter and was done nicely.  Service are provide by none other than Greg and Miko who are also the owners. Definitely a cute couple.  I came here during the day time twice on two different occasion, but they were close.  I think their hours are between 5pm-11pm,  but not exactly sure.  If you enjoy the little things in life then you have to come here and reward yourself with a nice bowl of ramen.  Also a bonus to meet Greg and Miko since they are one the most nicest, genuine people around.",

I had the tempura which was battered to perfection.  Truly great tempura.  I also had hamachi sashimi.  Heaven on earth!  The hamachi was fresh, buttery, and soft.  I was told they use the higher grade of hamachi.  You must have their gyoza.  Holy cow, the best gyoza in town.  I plan on going back for the gyoza alone.  I also had their ramen.  While not the best, it does in a pinch.  The tonkatsu is an amazing broth but, not as thick as a tonkatsu broth should be.  The noodles were a little overcooked and the egg was not a soft boiled egg.  Trust me, it won't stop me from ordering ramen again when I have a craving and a limited amount of time.  And you get the gyoza with it which to me is an incredible deal! ramen and gyoza for $9.50  And they are vegan friendly which is great when I go out with the lovely vegans in this town.    I plan on trying more sushi and will let you know.",

    "text": "Wow! This was an incredible dining experience!  I've been trying to cut out dairy and meat out of my diet, mainly for health reasons, and have been really noticing a difference in my health! This restaurant was ranked pretty high on <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhappycow.com&s=d87abe04a95bf05c19fa47b9d17ec3cfdaaff49c0203e5d60a14eed8feba70eb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">happycow.com</a>--one of the largest vegan/vegetarian resource guides on the web. I dragged my best friend and very much a meat eater with me to try Miko's out. Although I have been eating mainly vegetable-focused diet, I could only imagine what vegan Japanese food may be like...and I was not disappointed!  If you read the rest of my reviews, you will notice that I am big on decor...and Miko's was definitely lacking in that department. Clean, but rather boring and small. Not many decorations. The restroom was surprisingly clean and lively, however. The service was great, I felt like I was a family member of the owners, as both of them (husband and wife) catered to all of our needs, brought our food, and engaged us in conversation.   At first, the menu was very unassuming, and I could only see a few vegetarian, but no vegan food listed. However, once the owner noticed my confusion, he asked if I was vegan/vegetarian, and provided an amazing vegan menu! So much selection! If you are trying to eat macrobiotic, this menu is full of choices! I got the vegan sampler to sample a little bit of everything. It was incredible! Fresh, delicious, and oh-so-flavorful! Don't remember everything that was on the platter, but do know that everything was great.   My friend, upon my suggestion, got broiled mackarel. I had a piece, and boy, it was delicious! Just enough sea salt on the crust, so healthful and flavorful! Miso soup was also incredibly flavorful at this location. Hands down, the best I've had in Vegas so far.  Although the decor was lacking, I LOVED the food. I'm sure their non-vegetarian options are also excellent, judging by the comments here. This restaurant will definitely be my staple as far as healthy vegan options go--it's excellent!   I'm a little surprised that no other vegans/vegetarians commented on the restaurant...when I dined there, seemed like most other tables were occupied by vegans...  Either way, highly recommended! One of the best dining experiences I've had in a long time!",

Their sushi menu is limited (has one page instead of the usual 2-3 pages that other sushi places have) but that's because they have many Japanese dishes and entrees on the menu too. Met the owner Greg who's extremely nice and we now look forward to seeing him everytime we go to his restaurant! Will definitely come back to try some of their authentic dinner entrees. Happy Hour from 4-7pm. Greg says if you get there during Happy Hour, the happy hour special is extended throughout the rest of your stay. So you could be there from 5pm til 10pm and it will still be happy hour for you! Awesome!!  Hubby and I had: Tempura Roll - excellent Japanese Lasagna Roll - amazing (one of our favorites even though it's Americanized sushi) Spider Roll - Good  *Update: This is now my most favorite sushi place in all of Las Vegas! Hubby and I take a weekly Monday trip to Miko's because we crave the food!! We still get the Japanese Lasagna every time and the Tempura Roll - which is my  top favorite roll. Why? It's crispy, hot, has salmon, cream cheese and scallions inside that give it the perfect taste. The Kalbi short ribs are amazing! Try the cold Lychee and Raspberry Sake, they are soo good. Try the Nigori too (unfiltered sake - you can taste the rice!). The Tiger Roll is yummy and the Kiss of Fire, etc! It's all good. I have NOTHING bad to say about this place. I've forgot about Bachi Burger next door and would pick Miko's place over Bachi any day!!!!!!!!!!",

We tried the \"Pick 5\" Menu. Every dish was delish. The chef is Japanese and so is the owner. Miko and her husband work there and they are trying the best to make you feel welcome.  We ordered among others:  - Tempura = 4 1/2 * - Yoshinoyaki Beef = 5 * - Tonkatsu Pork Rice Bowl = 4* - Sashimi = 5 * - Hamachi = 4 1/2*  The place is clean, very authentic and the price is decent as well. We will definetly be back!",

I've tried a few things on their menu and I've enjoyed every one I tasted. My favorite dish has to be the tuna sushi bowl. The curry is also a great choice when it is available. Their hawaiian roll has an interesting flavor and I loved it. I'm determined to try all their rolls. I highly recommend finishing off the meal with the green tea ice cream.   The staff is great and very friendly. And Greg's a great host. Be sure to watch out for their specials too!   It's always nice to drop by for a meal at Miko's",

    "text": "I have struggled to find a Japanese restaurant in Vegas that served an excellent Katsu Curry, but now my search is over.  While it is a specialty item and is not on the menu everyday, I highly recommend that everyone try it when it is offered.  The curry is as good as I have had in any other city and the Tonkatsu is cooked to perfection being crispy on the outside while tender on the inside.  They also offer it with Chicken Katsu and also with just curry and no protein.  All of their Tonkatsu dishes are fantastic; the Tonkatsu dinner and especially the Katsu-Don.  They also have great appitizers like the chicken karage and gyoza that is made with turkey.  I realize that sounds unusual, but it tastes absolutely fantastic.  I do not pretend to be a sushi expert so I won't comment too much on that, but many of my friends are and they all swear that it is the freshest in town.    The owner is an excellent front of the house host and his wife is the chef and you can see her in the kitchen making everything fresh and by hand.  This is one of my favorite spots in Vegas and I highly recommend all fans of Japanese fare to try it out.",

    "text": "What a pleasant surprise!  Found Miko's tonight.  Story is, MIko and her husband Greg lived in SF, never operated a restaurant before -- moved to Vegas and after 5 years here, decided that their search for good tempura was futile.  They should do it themselves -- so Miko's was born.  And their tempura is yummy -- but so are the kalbi -- the sushi rolls we tried (Caliente and Fire Roll were our favs) -- oh and the agedashi tofu was amazing.    We shared some unfiltered sake and both got kirin (which is now on tap).    UNLV students -- please note - they serve 1/2 off beer and hot sake after 10.  Greg informed me that their karaoke machine is on the fritz at the moment, but they tend to have 3 separate demand generators:  lunch -- for the I've only got 30 minutes, gimme my tempura chcken crowd; familiy dinner with the kids crowd, and then the industry folk who begin to arrive around 10.  They're open late -- the food's good, the service is lovely.  Chi (probably not spelled right) has the energy and spunk for which she's named.  Miko is lovely and hospitable and very very interested in getting to know her customers.  The chefs are accommodating and friendly as well.    The interior  - despite the bright yellow walls -- is pretty sterile and simple, but the counter is fun and interesting and you can watch the full line.    They're not super crowded like Ichiza -- but that's location, too.  Off the 215 going southbound, they're in a new strip mall on the right hand side.    I'll definitely go back -",

This place was it!  It seems like this place is mainly for locals and the wandering tourists like me as it's a ways from the Strip and there doesn't seem to be any buses that go by there.   This is a nice little restaurant with a good selection of food for good prices. If you're an out of towner and have a rental car, this and other local joints are much better places to eat than whatever's on the Strip. The Strip restaurants may look fancy and flashy, but if you just want good food in a laid back place, come here and to other mom and pop places! Don't just stay on the Strip and get shafted.",

Happy hour 4-7 if you squeeze in before 7PM they let you keep the happy hour prices all night  Japanese owned and operated, this place provides a great little traditional get away very japanese-esque and fun.

    "text": "The Skinny: there are no words to describe the horror (1), service: empty tables, no service.... WTF?(1), Value... lesson learned (1).  We went to Miko's izakaya because it's close to the airport and I needed to catch a flight to SF. Seeing all the positive reviews with regards to the ramen, we were psyched to try this place out.   We enter into the restaurant and I notice there was one other couple about to leave. Their dishes still had quite a bit of food on them. A portent of what was to come.   Being me, seeing that they have an early bird Bento maki special I totally go for it  ($14.50). My hubby orders a tonkotsu ramen that comes with gyoza.  The gyoza are more like spring rolls here - some sort of bland meat wrapped in store bought wonton wrappers, deep fried and soggy. I have had many other gyoza before and these would rank in the bottom of the spectrum.  The worst part of the bento box was the infamous Hawaiian roll (an insult to Pacific Islanders everywhere). This was the singular, most offensive sushi memory to date.   Imagine sushi containing sliced, canned pineapple and cucumber. Top it off with a thin slice of mushy ahi tuna. Then drench it with a Pepto-bismol looking, sweet concoction and dried coconut. A smell, very similar to a cheap sunscreen, wafts through the air as you hone in for your first taste.  Yes, it is as unappetizing as it sounds.  After that jewel, there was a few different rolls (hot sauce, avocado and pickled vegetables; california roll with artificial crab, anorexic looking inari sushi) which were edible but still not very good. I couldn't eat the accompanying salad because the copious amount of odd creamy dressing. (This place has a thing for creamy dressings!)  The chicken teriyaki was mediocre. The meat was certainly not grilled (no char marks on it) and was soaking in yet again, a coyingly, sweet sauce.  Overall, I have had bentos for less, with more fish and that tasted way better.  The tonkotsu ramen was NOT tonkotsu ramen. The tonkotsu ramen is a ramen with a broth made from the pork marrow, bones and with a small hint of citrus. Because it is made with marrow, the soup is milky in colour and very rich.   This ramen was a clear consumme broth and tasted more like shio (salt broth) ramen without a hint of that rich porkiness. I know that they had the correct order because I heard the staff say \"tonkotsu\" ramen in the kitchen. The bbq pork in the ramen was very tough, lacking fat content.  With regards to the service, we waited a long time for the waitress to come by for the check. It surprised us because we were the only customers in the restaurant. After she took our credit card, she chatted on the phone in Japanese for a least 4-5 minutes prior to returning with the bill.  I really wanted to love this place. However my very poor experience makes me unlikely to come back again. If you do decide to brave this place, do not order their early bird special bento box A , Hawaiian rolls or their tonkotsu ramen.",

    "text": "I've always marveled at people who ate sushi, yakisoba etc in Japanese restaurants. Being a vegetarian it's often to find actual entrees to eat in a Japanese place and I get bored with the customary \"VEGETABLE ROLL\" in every other sushi restaurant.   Miko's to the rescue! I discovered this place while I was perusing Happy Cow (the veg website) one morning and immediately (I mean literally the minute after I read the menu I was out of the office) I galloped away to Miko's. From then on, I've been coming here regularly for my Japanese fix. This place has a SEPARATE VEGETARIAN/VEGAN menu!!!!  Located quite conveniently in the Windmill/Warm Springs/Gillespie area (my sense of direction as you can tell is awful), this is a small establishment owned by a cute Japanese couple and the chef here is this 80 year old Japanese sushi chef who came out of retirement to cook here. Imagine that!   These are the items I love to order:  1. Vegetable Salad - I ask them to add tofu for protein. Comes with an out of this world sesame miso dressing. I have been to every grocery store and even tried to home-make the dressing but to no avail. This dressing is really to die for  2. Vegetable Tempura - When ordered off the Vegetarian menu, the tempura batter used is eggless. The oil that the tempura is fried is changed often so the taste is fresh and pure. My husband loves the tempura here and cannot leave without getting at least a half order. Crispy and fresh, this is really the best tempura I've had  3. Rolls - We love the ladybug roll (avocado, sriracha and some other pickled veggies). The sensation of the heat of the sriracha is so surprising on a roll like this. We also love some other rolls here but I forget their names. Chances are, you won't be disappointed. We order our rolls with soy paper  4. Yakisoba - Yum Yum....Full of oil but if you're ready for a splurge go ahead and order this one. Vegetarian yakisoba...mmmm...no complaints at all!  5. Ramen - On a cold day (or if you are sick), this is such a feel good meal. Generous helping of noodles (tastes fresh) and onions and sprouts. We add tofu to our ramen. It's so satisfying  There are so many other amazing dishes here. Our friends who are not vegetarian like their seafood dishes too.   Cons of this place: A little on the pricey side esp for vegetarians/vegans as there are no set menus or specials. They are not open during lunch.",

    "text": "I had to try Miko's a second time before writing my review because I've heard such great things about this place I didn't want to base my review on a bad first experience.  First visit - Met a couple friends here for dinner at about 8pm on a Friday night. This place was jammed packed! My friends already had a table but service from that point on was all downhill. I ordered the Salmon shioyaki which not only took about 30-40 mins to arrive, towards the end of my waiting, the waitress comes out and says they are out of salmon, is salmon kama (similar to hamachi kama but salmon) okay? I said that fine.  Although, kama is a delicacy and I love it at AYCE sushi.. I was pretty pissed that I was paying $13 for a not so great part of the fish. This part is not very meaty at all. The bf though really enjoyed his spicy ahi bowl. I decided I do not want to write a review based off this experience since it was crazy busy.  Second Visit - Returned with the boyfriend for dinner on a Sunday evening, hoping it was not as busy as the last time. It was quiet not too busy. This time I order the small salmon sashimi which was only $5 or so for quite a few pieces! So ono and came with shredded daikon.. yum! I also ordered the shrimp tempura w/veggies. It was nice and crispy and I loved the assortment of veggies which included lotus root (never tried that before!). Second time, service was mediocre.. I think they were training a new lady who tried but I didn't think she was very efficient nor friendly. She forgot to bring us chopsticks which we had to wait with our food in front of us! Talk about torture!! OH one good thing.. happy hour everyday!   Overall, I will be back although I haven't had an AWESOME WTF OMFG experience. Maybe I put them too high on a steeple and was disappointed since it did not live up to it. I'll be back for sure.",

    "text": "I was alone and hungry one day and I decided to stop by Miko's to eat for the very first time. I just wanted to try it out, no expectations. I ordered their spicy yellowtail bowl (sushi bowls are usually my measuring sticks for rating Japanese places). I was blown away. The sushi cuts were bright, fresh, and wholesome and the rice was prepared in a special way, having a unique taste to it. And it was all presented in a beautiful bowl. I then noticed the entire staff was Japanese. From this first experience, I knew this place was different.    I've been to many Japanese places around town over the years, and Miko's stands out. All other Japanese places seemed to be just carbon copies of each other, and they lack some kind of labor of love that Miko's has. They aim to be a comfortable local place with quality food that is fresh and authentic. The tuna is dark crimson RED, not disgustingly pink like in most sushi places. They have a chef's special menu that changes periodically (the seasonal oysters were amazing, and I hate oysters). There's even a vegetarian menu. Greg, the owner, makes sure that they serve the best of everything in reasonable amounts and prices, from sake to ice cream. I always admired the modest passion for detail and quality in this place.  From the presentation to the taste, to the wonderful personalities of Greg and Miko, this place has become a common stomping ground for me for the past year. I've come to know them well now, and I believe their passion for their business shows in their food as well as in their personalities. It's difficult for me to go to other Japanese places because Miko's set the bar quite high. I've been recommending this place to others over time, and will continue to do so.",

    "text": "Ok here we go:  First off, I totally came in here based on a review a blogger wrote.  And that wasn't even a detailed review so I was just going to 'guinea pig' it alone.  I don't get many days where I can try some place on my own so I took advantage of being solo to try Miko's.  I started off by walking in to a not very crowded small sushi bar.  They were friendly without being ostentatious. (as in yelling something).  I was seated at the sushi bar and proceeded to order.  Seriously, I was kind of glad they didn't all call attention that I was a solo diner.  I started off with the edamame of course.  I also ordered a small Sapporo.  I noticed the edamame was cooked in boiling water.. um, as a typical American, why did I think they would use the microwave? Anyways, it came to me nice and warm and salty to tide me over until the rest of my food arrived.  And yeah, I ordered a bit more food than the average female cuz I wanted to try stuff! So there!  I ordered the (in English) grilled squid and Tuna Tataki.  The Tuna arrived first. I got to watch them make my dishes.  The Tuna was scorched and sliced and SUPER fresh.  Really people, I am pretty picky about that fishy smell and let me tell you, the Tuna was as fresh as can be.  Then I watched the Chef place a cleaned squid on the grill.  He watched it closely as it cooked to perfection.  Not too chewy or slimy.  Just right.  And served with an interesting tangy soy based sauce.  Very nice.  I marinated each squid ring in the sauce and was so appreciative of the subtle flavor of the sauce as it did not overwhelm the fresh flavor of the squid. (and I am really hoping you guys can handle me calling it squid instead of Calamari)  As I talked to the mother and son who were the servers of Miko's (the mother is MIko herself) I realized they were very motivated to keep the integrity of an authentic Japanese pub.  When Miko notified me that her gyoza were her signature dish, I could not resist making an order.  I got to watch the chef cook the gyoza in a simmering water bath until they were done and then he let the water evaporate until the gyoza could get browned in the oil left in pan.  OMG when it came to me it was a hot steaming dumpling of ground turkey and ginger smelling like Heaven itself!  Along side was a ginger based soy sauce with a tangy rice vinegar base that balanced out the dumpling perfectly.  Part of the attraction was that I had to watch it cooking in front of me and waiting and waiting and waiting which build up my anticipation.  I ate about 2 dumplings and took the other 3 to go.  I know my son will enjoy these the day after..who doesn't enjoy leftover gyoza? Really?  I ordered the Ichi (something) sushi roll to go for my husband.  He is used to crazy korean style, lots of ingredients, nuevo Americano rolls.  Even though this was more traditional, he enjoyed it immensely.  If you are craving some sushi and just want to hop into a quaint Mom and Pop type sushi place, give Miko's a try.  I really do not think you would be disappointed.  I wasn't and believe me, I am one darned picky eater.  I will be back, whether it's by myself or with a few friends (family).",

However, I DO NOT recommend their sushi! Omg, I think we just had the worst sushi ever!! Well, I can name a few places that were pretty bad but this was up there. We felt like our fish was out all day. Yikes!  We ordered the basics, Spicy Tuna, Miko's & another one (I can't remember the name right now).  Lets see, the rice was too glutinous and overly packed onto a sushi roll. The fish was warm. The spicy tuna roll should be fairly spicy by itself but this was very mild!   Overall, I think we will NEVER order sushi from this place again. If and when we do go back, it will be cooked food only!",

    "text": "This is a great neighborhood spot that is perfect for an after work meal on the way home.  They have a great happy hour with Sapporo on tap for $2 between 4-7pm daily.  They have a nice selection of other good beers too, including Stone IPA.  But the Sushi is where this place is at!!  On Thursday after work I stopped in and sat at the bar.  Started with a Stone IPA and the free edamame.  Yum.  I am a sucker for a good Tiger Roll and it is awesome here.  After devouring the Tiger roll I had a wonderful Unagi roll.  I was treating myself and spent a bit more than I usually do here.  I walked out spending $26 for 1 roll, 1 half-roll, and 1 ice-cold beer.  I would do it again tomorrow.  The owners are always in the restaurant serving customers and have made the place a wonderful neighborhood spot.  We have eaten here about 10 times and will continue to do so.",

The gyoza came out first but it took 45 minutes for the rest of the food to come out.  The waitress was pleasant and apologized for the delay.  The owner on the other hand avoided eye contact with us because I looked hungry and irritated.  We've been here on 3 different times before and the wait for food is ridiculous.  They do cater to westerners and forget about everyone else.  I won't be coming here anytime soon.",

They are open till 12am on Friday/Saturday so its a great spot for late night snacking. Since I am vegetarian, I loved that they had a separate menu for vegan/vegetarian options. The menu is great because its not your standard avocado roll or veggie roll.... very unique rolls.  The veggie yakisoba noodle dish was so yummy after a night out. My husband absolutely loved it and reminded him of authenticity of his days stationed in Okinawa. I enjoyed the Age tofu roll - crispy fried tofu! Another roll had coconut shavings on top and avocado. It was great with the dipping sauce it came with.  The service was also great... he gave us suggestions on what to try next time. Udon noodles are popular and if you ever need a simple meal when you are feeling sick, homemade ramen noodle.  Definitely will be back.",

    "text": "Found this place from Yelp (yay!) under \"vegetarian sushi\". It just happened to be the closest sushi place between South Point (where I was staying) and the Strip (where I didn't want to be driving at that point). Cute little place with awesome owners who also happened to be our waiters! It's a very small place, but there was hardly anyone there, and when we sat down, the owner basically said, \"you've never been here before, huh?\" which I thought was really cool. There were some locals there chatting to the sushi chefs - also cool. :)  The highlight of Miko's is that they have an ENTIRE menu devoted to vegetarian and vegan sushi. *drools* Basically, anything on the menu had a vegetarian/vegan alternative, something I appreciate very, very much.  My partner and I tried a few things: agedashi roll (tofu and veggies), vegetarian Hawaiian roll, tempura, miso soup, and California roll. The flavors of everything we ate were fabulous, the avocado in the rolls was fresh, and the rolls didn't taste \"fishy\" like at some places. It was also extraordinarily cheap for a sushi place, considering our meal only cost us about $30 for all that. I guess that's fair-priced. The food was great - not the *best* sushi I've ever had, but well worth trying again. It was also awesome that they were open super late, since I didn't get around to eating dinner until 9. ;)",

    "text": "Came here one cold night in December with a friend, and it was moderately busy, with more than half of the tables full. The place is small, but it's comfortable for a date or a small lunch/dinner party (think 4 people). The specials are written on the whiteboard on the wall behind the chefs, and I DEFINITELY recommend trying everything on it! The owner came over and chatted with us for a bit. This was both me and my friend's first time to the place, and we were asking him questions about what was particularly good that evening. After telling him our orders, we chatted while the food came out, and it was all delicious: not overly seasoned, and really fresh and clean. Miko's is the only place that I've been able to have uni and find it palatable. Scratch that, it wasn't only palatable, it was downright yummy! It didn't taste fishy/briny/like gross pier seawater at all (what I've had uni taste like in the past; yuck!), but slightly sweet. I was VERY impressed! The scallop nigiri was so delicious and fresh-tasting that we ended up ordering seconds. I've never had nigiri so fresh before in my life (granted, I haven't been to Japan either, so there you go). I'd say this was the best sushi experience I've ever had in Vegas, hands down. The owner even came back after we ordered more scallops and offered us a taste of freshly grated wasabi. If you're used to the green wasabi paste, this is NOTHING like that; so much more concentrated but way, way better! It starts off subtler than the paste before giving you a GIANT KICK of flavor, and then fading away. I'd come back just to taste the wasabi again! Definitely, definitely go to Miko's if you're looking for some of the freshest nigiri in town! We tried other small plates, too, but the nigiri stuck with me the most. I'd come here again, no doubt!",

The food quality is absolutely fantastic. My friend Teri M. And I decided to go here on a Friday night (2 Fridays ago) as we were craving sushi. We ordered a jalapeno sashimi special called Kanpachi. similar to yellowtail but BETTER! Better than yellowtail?!? No way. Yes!!! It melts in your mouth and had a kick to it. Whew.   Couldn't resist an order of Hamachi mmmm mm so fresh. Ordered a special roll called Yoshi roll that the server recommended and it was heavenly. Every bite was so tasty. Teri also ordered a noodle soup dish Tonkatsu ramen noodles that she loved.  I've been here a few other times but have always sat at the sushi bar. It is always so good. We had a table this time and the service was super fast.  It's not like those ayce places - it doesn't even compare. No ayce and you don't even miss it. You get more quality for your money here. Check this place out!!!!!",

It's good enough but this cowboy prefers his salmon wild. The hamachi was balanced nicely. The karaage was a miss, skip it.  Overall, decent sushi for Vegas, not a sushi destination for the obvious reason. 3.25 stars bumped up to 4 because of the great service.",

Then again, I went to a new place expecting the same things I'm used to from two other regular spots.  Hamachi kama was overcooked and a tad pungent.  We waited about 45 minutes for it. A tad long. We got here at 510 and just finished the kama at 635pm.   Good effort.",

I was really craving some late night Japanese comfort food, and I stumbled upon this place on UberEATS. The black garlic tonkotsu ramen immediately caught my eye; it really intrigued me because I LOVE good tonkotsu ramen and I love garlic, too, but I've never seen the two of them meet. I was not disappointed! The noodles were packed separately from the broth, so they weren't soggy. The egg was perfect, and just a hint spicy. And the broth itself was sublime. Garlicky, rich and eminently satisfying. And if you're not a big eater, just a nosher, there's plenty for two.  I also ordered the fried oysters. They were good. Not too oily, and as crisp as they could be, given the delivery time. Not too \"fishy\" tasting, either.  My only disappointment was the sushi. The tuna (maguro) and the unagi were acceptable in quality, but they were delivered cold, and that really affected the quality of the rice, which was a bit too al dente and lacking in cohesiveness. And sushi's about the rice, not the fish!  There some other tantalizing things on the menu, and the prices are pretty reasonable for Japanese cuisine, so I will definitely be ordering from them again. Just probably not the sushi.",

The husband and wife are always there greeting customers and preparing delicious meals!  Wait staff is very attentive and they are always happy to serve you.

There are some things unique to this spot that you can't find anywhere else: fresh ground wasabi (I love it and can't stand the paste), gyoza (dumplings) are made with turkey instead of pork, extensive Vegan/Vegetarian menu, and their dynamite is unlike any other I have tried.

Well, we sit on other sushi bars all the time. Maybe he think we were uneducated hillbillies from some third country. Also he asked us if we wanted to order Ramen, then he said we should go to the place across the street for Ramen. Then some of us sit at a small table, the owner immediately asked us to order food without giving us any chances to even take a look at the menu. Maybe the owner have discrimination for Asian people, but why opened a Japanese restaurant then ...........  We eventually left.  Without any apology, the owner kept blaming us for not making the reservation while we walking out.",

My wife and I were in Las Vegas for a wedding and stopped at Miko's on our last night.  We tried several buffets including the very good and highly rated Bacchanal the prior night, and I wasn't expecting much this last night.  Miko's was close to our hotel and we had a very early flight.  Well, I have to say this place made our trip.    We started with the cold tofu with ginger and green onions.  I have never had this dish with shredded ginger (usually shaved fish) but it was fabulous.  The sashimi came with a small dish of real wasabi (the plant, not the paste) and I don't know what it was, but this made every piece of fish come alive in my mouth.   I'm back in the Bay Area now 3 days later and I can't stop thinking about Miko's.  Greg, the owner, also recommended a spicy tuna roll (fire something) which was soooo good!  I know that what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas, but this is not a secret to keep. This place rocks!  Nothing fancy, just the best sashimi in the world.  We will be back.",

I like the style of sunomono--cucumbers, wakame and noodles in the pickling liquid. The gobo was nice and tender, a little on the sweet side, and rich with sesame. The dipping sauce with the yakitori was nice and spicy.  The sashimi dinner had a good assortment of fish (I didn't count, but it was about 8-10 different kinds), very fresh and nicely presented.  I was very happy with my meal.",

Fried oysters crispy and had a good fresh taste, did not care for the sauce that came w/ it, would rather have a lighter sauce(ponzu) edaname was a little different they sprinkle w salt n pepper , nice touch. The agedashi tofu was really good , with a nice light sweet shoyu sauce . The sushi rolls were good the rice was not too sweet or mushy ingredients fresh. I wish the spicy tuna was a little more spicy.            I also had the tonkutsu ramen the broth was clean , fresh tasting with a nice pork flavor . The noodles were perfect had a nice texture an chew. The ramen also had bamboo shoots,hard boiled egg and kamaboko and couple pieces of roast pork. Wife had the shoyu ramen , I had a taste of the broth very good , both ramens came w/ turkey gyoza first for me very good.  The shrimp tempura looked so good we had to order some for dessert lol.  Shrimp did not disapoint us, it was very good w/ nice tempura sauce. Service was efficient and very friendly, found out after our meal our server was also the owner Greg very nice guy.

Their vegan menu is pretty good and their fish was super fresh, at least the first time it was.... the second visit wasn't quite as good.  Like a lot of people mentioned the service is soooooo slow. It's a small place but they can't seem to fire dishes at the same time and it's never fun to watch your friends eat while you starve at the table. I can deal with some slow service if the food is good but this second visit was OUTRAGEOUS! We took a couple friends there and it was embarrassing. My husband got his food first, we watched him eat for a while before any other dishes were brought out. Then our friends got a steady stream of food. I watched them eat. I ordered a sashimi platter. I waited for OVER AN HOUR for my dinner. Everyone was done eating when I got my food and I was beyond agitated. None of the food was as tasty on the second trip and our friends were not impressed either. The owner offered me a free glass of wine or dessert but I when I told him I don't like either nothing else was offered. Won't be going back and our friends won't let us choose the restaurant next time.....",

When we walked in, we were greeted by an older gentleman (presumed owner). We asked him if he had Alaska rolls. He got the most bewildered look on his face as if he had never heard of such a thing. We were about to leave, and now I wish we had left. Just then, he asked the chef about Alaska rolls. The chef said, oh yeah, I know what that is, and he described it perfectly, so we decided to have a seat. No one came to the table to offer a menu or water, or place settings, etc. that seemed a bit odd since we didn't actually order anything. We just inquired about the Alaska roll. A while passed by, and still nothing. Then finally someone arrives with an Alaska roll. But it did not look like an Alaska roll, and it certainly was not what the described. We didn't want to be rude, but we asked the waiter if he could please put salmon on top as he described and as is customary for Alaska rolls. We were very kind about it. Not sure what the waiter said to the chef, but all of a sudden the chef started yelling at us in front of and over the top of all of the other patrons. We were shocked. At first it was hard to tell what he was saying, but he kept getting louder so that the whole restaurant could hear. He really embarrassed himself. Not only did he not know how to prepare the sushi, but he also did not know how to control his temper or conduct himself in a professional manner. I feel sorry for him. Maybe he was having a really bad day. But I have had Alaska rolls dozens of times at multiple places and I have eaten at restaurants well over 2000 times. I have never seen such poor behavior. Not even once. So I feel as though I should warn you.",

    "text": "Their vegetarian dishes are plentiful, and you get a good amount with them (I ordered something akin to chow mein with stir-fried vegetables, and I couldn't finish half of it because they gave me so much!)  Their menu has some interesting items as far as combination and stir-fry plates go. As for the sushi (sashimi and traditional sushi pieces), I have to admit they are a little pricey, and there is cheaper sushi to be found elsewhere. They do feature special plates with combinations of different sushi pieces, but like I said, there are definitely better deals elsewhere in town than here.   Overall, the plate that I had was delicious. I went after work during the later hours of the night, and since the place was nearly vacant, I didn't have a problem with getting my food quickly. The service was nice and friendly, and do expect a little of the \"shogun\" attitude here and there. I will definitely have to return to try other things!",

PS:  For some reason or another,this place seems to be crawling with great looking babes. In a sushi bar? Kind of like discovering the love of your life is a Rush fan. Go figure.",

I had some delicious tempura soba noodles, perfectly seasoned with umami taste, so the quality of the food is as good as ever.  I hear that Greg still pops by every now and then.  I hope both he and Miko will still be seen there, as they are such kind, generous people.    I have high expectations for another generation of great, casual dining.",

This is not evident anywhere online, and when asked, the explanation I was given was \"we've only been doing lunch three or four months now.\" Well, judging by the completely empty dining room (not to mention the signage), it hasn't been very successful.   Strike 2: Came in while on this side of town for work, during dinner hours, specifically to get that damn chirashi. It was pretty but the featured fish were basic and bland, cut thick but not much flavor. I was never provided ginger or wasabi, which is a shame because the table beside me got the fresh kind. Service killed it for me. I got Chinatown service- no acknowledgement upon entering, menu dropped off and order taken within two minutes, then a FORTY MINUTE WAIT for my food, vague \"Anything else?\"/check drop. Wasn't impressed, friends later told me the cooked dishes are stronger.  Strike 3: There is no strike three, this isn't baseball. Might as well close for lunch if you're going to phone it in and turn away business. Consider hiring an additional sushi chef if you're regularly backed up that much on a weeknight.  Fellow diners, come for their HH alcohol specials and order their cooked dishes for better results.",

Other dishes we had were the Yakitori, Kushiyaki, and Sliced Beef Tongue. All were just OK again. Hamachi Kama was cut into two pieces and dry. The process of a protein going from done to shrinking and expelling its moisture can happen in as little as a couple of minutes. It's not something I expect when paying a professional establishment to cook my food for me.  Timing was an issue with the last two dishes.

If you want a break from the fantasy that is The Strip and if you appreciate real Japanese food, not the \"Japanese-style\" food at the all-you-can-eat sushi places around town, come on by here. Japanese-owned and operated.   Came on a Sunday for dinner, the place was almost empty, so we were a little worried, but a few words of Japanese with the hostess got the ball rolling. Enjoyed the edamame, salmon poke, salmon yuzu, gyoza, agedashi tofu, karaage, tonkatsu, sushi special, udon, ramen, and saba. Saba had some bones, but was otherwise fine.  Dinners came with traditional miso soup and salad. Kids drank calpico, I had Kirin draft.   There were more specials that looked good and there were certainly many sushi rolls on the menu.  Wanted to come back on Monday, but sadly they are closed on Mondays.   Conveniently close to the Rental Car Center if you are traveling.   Don't get me wrong, this is not a fu-fu place with tatami mats, hostesses in kimonos, exorbitant prices, or anything like that. Just good izakaya food in a family friendly setting. 5-star value at this price point.   I would definitely recommend this restaurant to friends and family.",

Their menu is plentiful w/ appetizers galore, soups/udons, noodles, and sushi.    What we ordered:  Yoshi Roll-  I was told it was Shrimp Tempura inside with Yellowtail and jalapeno on top.  I was contemplating getting a roll or yellowtail sashimi w/ jalapeno on top.  This was the best of both worlds.   Decent flavor, taste the spiciness of the jalapeno + hot sauce, nothing that amazed me though.    Mixed tempura appetizer-  We asked the lady how many pieces of shrimp this $6 appetizer came with and she said \"three\".   Only two pieces of shrimp along with the standard assortment of veggies.  :(  Gyoza-  Delicious.  Made with turkey instead of pork.   These were good and I'd eat this all the time here.  Chicken teriyaki (kid's plate) - Came with rice, miso soup, and a salad.  Not bad.  The miso soup has small pieces of vermicelli noodles.  Nice different touch.  Baked mussels- Yummy!  4 nicely sized mussels, came out nice and hot.     Chokomoko ice cream sandwich-  Looked awesome, tasted great.   The waffle could have had more of a crunch to it the way it would be if you were eating an ice cream cone.  It was soft instead.  But it was fun to dip that into the whipped cream and chocolate.    The service was fair.  The staff was pretty attentive.  Only once did I have my glass of water down to just ice cubes.  I'd give them 3.5 stars if I could.",

Kids had chicken teriyaki that they gobbled up! All in all, small joint but the quality was awesome. Service was good! 2 dragon, one soft crab, one volcano, 2 choco-something, 2 beef bowl whatchamacallit, and one kid chicken teriyaki plate = $106.something. I'd go back for the volcano roll.

    "text": "This is a long overdue review for our families favorite sushi restaurant in Las Vegas. My family and I enter the restaurant and immediately I see Greg the owner and I give him a big healthy happy to see you hug. Tonight we are extra hungry so we sit down and immediately start ordering from the vegan menu.. Yes folks Miko's even has a vegan sushi menu.Before we even get a chance to order Greg returns to our table with a new salad and vegan dressing that he had recently created and wanted our family to try. The verdict? The dressing was delicious.. Ginger and sesame seed made my mouth sing! I told Greg that vegan dressing or not he should make that the house dressing.We then proceeded to order some warm sake and edamame as well as miso soup to get the party started.  We quickly cleaned our bowls an were ready for round two of hijjiki and 2 bowls of kimpora.  After we barely took a breath and a swig of sake, we were ready for round three! We settled on rabbit rolls, Traditional Gord rolls, Hawaiin rolls, american caterpillar and Bella ordered tempora green beans and asparagus. We ordered all of the rolls with Haiga rice. This is a delicious healthy rice with the fiber still in tact... Unlike the nutrient dead white rice. Our rolls were prepared to perfection. The Hawaiian roll with fresh pineapple and coconut sauce could easily have been my dessert.. So decadent! Greg gave us the back story on the Gord rolls.  My family and I drive to Henderson from Summerlin about 20 miles because Miko's is that good!",

Not only was the fish super clean and fresh, our sushi chef was extremely personable and informative. We eventually were just putty in his hands and told him we didn't need to understand what he was talking about... We trusted him. Obvious that there were so many regulars there too. Kind of the Cheers of sushi joints. Will DEFINATELY be back!!!  Ok so just had round two and it is still amazing! If your idea of sushi is a bunch of deep fried subpar fish drenched in a bunch of super mayonnaisey sauce then this is not the place for you. However, if you appreciate the beautiful delicate butteriness of good quality fish just lightly kissed with great quality ingredients solely for the purpose of enhancing the experience then this is your spot!",

I've been vegan for a few months now and sushi was definitely one of the things I missed most since changing my eating habits. My boyfriend and I had a few different rolls here and they were all great.   We came during happy hour on a Thursday, their happy hour is only for drinks but the experience was still great.   Upon seating ourselves the waiter brought us complementary edamame which was a nice appetizer.  Then we ordered the Agetofu roll and Popeye roll. The tofu roll was fried tofu with avocado on top and it had a distinct mint-like flavor but was good, #3 for me and the Popeye was pineapple and avo in and spinach on top! It was a great flavor combo, and slightly sweet, that one was my #2. And we were still hungry and wanted to try another so we ordered the Lily roll which was the winner #1 for me. It has root vegetable with a delicious salty flavor inside and avocado and Sriracha on top. I will be going back for that one!",

Only fresh fish.  If you've been in Vegas long, apparently there used to be a sushi restaurant for like 15 years in the old Hilton.  The sushi chef here, used to own that place.

Our decision was based primarily on the previous Yelp reviews and proximity to our location (we were shopping at the LV Blvd Outlets). The restaurant opened at 5pm that day, and Happy Hour was from 5-7pm (alcohol only). We ended up having a round of sake bombs and a couple pitchers of Sapporo beer. We ordered 7 specialty rolls, 3 hand rolls, and a sashimi plate. All were very good, and prices were average. The owner visited our table several times and chatted with us, which was very nice. He and the waitress were very attentive in every aspect of the dinner, filling our water and cleaning up our mess as we made it (did I mention we had sake bombs at the beginning?).  The highlight was the real wasabe that was served with our sushi/sashimi. The owner explained that the green paste you normally see is really powered American horseradish with green food coloring. Real wasabe tastes much different and is pretty awesome.  Yesterday, I confirmed that no one really serves real wasabe, primarily due to cost (it's about x7 to x10 more expensive).",

If you're looking for a place that has authentic Japanese food, this is the place.

I've been looking off and on for good Japanese food that doesn't break the bank since I moved to Vegas a year ago, and I've finally found it.  I've been there twice this week already and everything has been great.  The first night I had katsudon and gyoza. The gyoza is quite nice, and has a turkey filling.  The katsudon was superb - everything cooked just right - nothing overdone, nothing underdone, and tasted just like I've had in Japan.  The next night, I had shoyu ramen, which was also excellent. Flavorful broth, good noodles, half a boiled egg, a few slices of beef, those spiral-looking fish cakes I can never remember the name of, and some vegetables.  I am definitely looking forward to future visits, and may return to post about more items :)   Update: Went there again, tried the takoyakiten, and it was excellent - just a slightly different name for what I'm used to seeing as simply \"takoyaki\"  Grabbed some yum yum sauce to dip them in and was in heaven - it's been way too long since I've had takoyaki :)",

For the appetizer I had Dynamite, which probably got its name because it will have you screaming like Jimmy Walker after your first bite.  Dynamite is scallops baked.with mushrooms and carmelized onions, and I think some cream of mushroom sauce. Than it's topped with avocado and I think eel sauce (there's no eel in eel sauce, but its used to top eel. Think teriyaki sauce only thicker). It was so good I wish I had ordered some rice to soak up the sauces.  Next up for my entree was katsudon, a famous Japanese dish. In Japan its custom to have this dish before a big test because the word Katsu means \"to win\".  Basically its a bowl of rice topped with a breaded and fried pork cutlet, an egg, onions, and chopped spring onion. There's some spices in their too that really make the dish. Charlie Sheen must be eating this stuff every night because its a \"winning\" dish.  The meal came with miso soup and some salad, nothing special, but good. They also serve some salted edemame. Needless to say I was stuffed when I left.  The service was excellent and very friendly. The women that work there are very sweet and have those adorable Japanese accents. It's really cute because when you leave you hear them all say thank you, first the waitress, than the woman at the register, and some other tiny voice way in back from a girl I didn't see. Than the sushi chef said goodbye in his deep voice. I almost felt like I was in Japan.  Miko's is right next to Bachi Burger, a really excellent Japanese burger place I also recommend, but if you're in the mood for a more traditional Japanese meal please give Miko's a try. They also have sushi, but I haven't tried it yet. If its the same quality as their dinners I'm sure its top rate stuff. Thank you for reading.",

    "text": "After having eaten at many Japanese restaurants in Las Vegas I can honestly say Miko's can contend against the best of them. Forget all these other faux Japanese places because here's the real deal by owners Greg and Miko.    From the cooked dishes to the sushi and sashimi, the portions here feel just right. Their dedication to having only the freshest of fish available is also well defined. The Sushi Dinner prepared by Shu-san, Miko's sushi chef, was what made me an immediate fan of the establishment. I wasn't bothered by the prices knowing I received quality freshness and taste I wasn't getting going to some all-you-can-eat joint.   Also look out for the number of Chef's Specials that are offered and change depending on the season (ranging anywhere from curry rice to monk fish liver to tuna steak), one of the primary reasons I'm a frequent visitor. The rice they use is also among the best I've ever tasted, which is well illustrated in their rice bowls. For non-meat lovers Miko's also has a menu exclusively for the vegetarian/vegan palette.   This is a place far removed from the trends and cliches of other Japanese restaurants that proliferate Las Vegas, many of which aren't even operated by Japanese to begin with. It's got a quaint ambiance and prides itself in just being a simple neighborhood hangout instead of drawing those typical loud boisterous crowds that often occupy fancied sushi places throughout the city.",

    "text": "Gyumza. You may know them as gyoza, but from here til eternity Miko's will now be referred to as gyumza because their deliciousness deserves nothing less. First, they are made with turkey, which I adore, and if you're a pork lover, don't worry, you won't miss a thing! Second, they are in what I think may be a signature wrapper because I have never seen it before! It is like a a big noodle Hot Pocket. Brilliant. And third, they are delicious.  Besides gyoza, the other marker of quality Japanese cuisine is fresh fish, and they have it. My litmus for fresh fish is yellowtail, as I think that only the freshest of the fresh can escape a fishy flavor. The yellowtail at Miko's is scrumptious with the perfect fresh taste. My husband also had the raw scallops, and he was impressed. Also of note, you can get half rolls from their signature section, which is great if you aren't sure if you will enjoy something. Their signature rolls aren't wickedly creative or outlandish. It is pretty straightforward, as I think they really focus on provided fresh, simple ingredients.   They are definitely vegan and vegetarian friendly, just be sure to ask for that menu as the main menu on the table does not feature everything. However, it does feature the gyumza, and perhaps that is all that really matters.",

The service was great! I had ordered the Oyako-don and an order of chicken kaarage to go. I also had an order of the appetizer shtimp tempura and Gyoza while I waited (I was starving) along with a beer.  I actually had a nice conversation with Greg, he told me how he started Miko's. I explained how hard it is to find a \"real\" japanese restaraunt in my area that doesnt just serve sushi, teriyaki, and tempura only.... I highly recommend Miko's to anyone who loves Japanese \"comfort\" food. They have great specials, 1/2 price draft Sapporo or Kirin 4pm-7pm is awesome in my book, and the lunch menu is a great deal also. It is refreshing to find a place that offers great food at reasonable prices, with a pleasant staff that makes you feel at home.  I will definately be going back time and time again...",

I wasn't expecting to find anything great this far out of town, but I was pleasantly surprised by Miko's. I thought I'd have to settle for decent, although still pretty tasty, sushi here in the valley, after living between California and the pacific northwest most of my life... But Miko's is amazing. Even the uni was great and I'm picky with that. My favorite is the spicy tuna (with tuna on top if the chef is feeling generous ;)). They have a great happy hour as well as great drinks. Draft sapporo beer and the draft sake were my favorites. The staff consists of only a few people which is why they're not open all day. I cannot praise this restaurant enough. I don't think I can eat sushi anywhere else now. Amazing food and generous staff. Definitely worth the drive no matter where you live",

First and foremost, the food is excellent.  Miko's offers the most extensive cooked food selections, all very reasonably priced.  For example, the yummy and generously portioned hamachi-kama (perfectly broiled yellow-tail collar) set dinner comes with miso soup, salad, rice and four california rolls, all for under 13 bucks.  They also feature the city's best tempura dishes.  Foodies will find daily whiteboard specials delightful as there are many exotic and fresh goodies to be had in sushiland.  The service is excellent and the atmosphere is reminiscent of the Cheers sitcom bar, only Japanese.  The owners are as charming as the warm yellow decor, always looking to get to know their customers.  Miko's is also a great late night hangout with a lively sushi bar.  One visit and you will know why I go as much as I do.",

    "text": "We were going to another place for ramen because they said they had rice noodles, well, they didn't, and Miko's was in the same strip mall. So we checked it out, they had a veg menu and gluten free jank for the ladypants.  We lived in Japan for 5 years, we love Japan, we miss Japan. But we have tempered our expectations when it comes to Japanese here in the states.  So, there will be a lot of food mentioned in this review for a couple reasons, one being that we are gluttons, the other reason is it was so good we came back the next night to eat again.  the agedashi tofu is delicious. The broth for this tofu is so good, I want to shoot it into my veins. I want to drink it like precious manna.   The cucumber salad is delicious, just like in Japan.  The yakisoba, while a touch different than most I have had, was still delicious.   The tempura vegetable roll was huge and amazing. They make a vegetable roll, then tempura batter it, deep fry, then cut it. It is like some Epic Meal Time shit. And the sauces that some with it are amazing.  But the ramen is the centerpiece. Veggie ramen. So good. All I needed was a blizzard outside and I would have been convinced I was in Misawa, Japan. Noodles were perfect, veg was great. Broth was almost criminally good. Best ramen I have had outside of Japan.  And they have Calpico.  Simply put, this place is amazing. The fact that it is a family affair makes it even better. Anywhere but Las Vegas and this place would be so overrun by hipsters that the line would be 2 hours long and totally ironic.",

    "text": "I came in here one night by myself and sat at the sushi bar because they were so busy there was quite a wait for a table.  I was so excited to try the ramen but felt that since I was sitting at the sushi bar I needed to order some sushi (that's my excuse for pigging out).  I ordered some nigiri and the tonkatsu ramen.    The nigiri is so delicious and fresh.  Unfortunately, I ended up sitting there for about 40 minutes before my ramen came out.  And when it did, it was not at all worth the wait.  The noodles were slightly undercooked, and the broth lacked the depth of some of my favorite ramen joints.  They had an egg, but it seemed like it was just a normal hard boiled chicken egg.  It added nothing but awkwardness to the dish.  There were a couple pieces of chasyu that were not tender at all and looked carelessly cut.  I was sorely disappointed.  So far, with my two visits, I've determined that I should only stick to ordering nigiri or sashimi.  I'll have to try the gyoza others have mentioned next time I go.  Another thing to note is that on this visit, when I first sat, at least three different people asked for my order and made sure I had ordered stuff.  As time went on, they seemed to forget about me.  Finally, the original server who took my order asked if I ever got my ramen.  This was 40 minutes later.  I counted.  I told her no, it was fine but asked for another beer.  Finally my ramen came but that last beer was nowhere to be found.  At this point I had finally began to get annoyed, especially since the ramen I had so looked forward to was less than mediocre.  I decided to forego the beer, paid my check and left.  What started out as such a great visit turned into a disappointment.",

Next, we had the Lemon Drop - this was on the chef's special list, but there was nothing special about it.  The salmon was flavorless and the roll was blah.  Third, well there was no third or fourth, because we ended our meal.  This was not getting any better.  I could never recommend this place.  There are far better places to dine in Vegas.",

I have had really good ramen with some solid flavors like this place, having lived in Hawaii, but since we left the islands, haven't found too many places that satisfied all of my cravings until now.   We started off with the edaname, it was sprinkled with salt & pepper which was unique and added to the flavors. I like a good sprinkle of pepper on just about everything. We also tried the fried tofu, two types of sushi, spicy tuna and the caterpillar roll. All of these were great choices. I love my spicy tuna SPICY, and this was mild but still good taste.   We both got ramen, I had the shoyu ramen, and was pleased with the looks as well as the taste. I will enjoy coming back as the weather gets colder for a big bowl of hot ramen, and this will be top choice for me.   As an after thought, we wanted to try the tempura, so we put in an order, kinda after we had finished our meals, it was hot and cooked perfect. I guess I didn't realize how much I missed eating this type of food, since moving to Vegas, there are so many other places to try, it was a really good choice and will definitely be again.",

    "text": "Irasshaimase!  No akachochin out front but Miko's is more than welcomeng.  How can you tell, take a look at all the Nihonjin peeps on the kitchen line!  The True test to authenticity....hiyahh!  I can't believe that I never ate at this place sooner, especially since it is in the same shopping center as Bachi Burger.  I bookmarked this place way back when, but was shocked to find out where it was and how good it was when we got here.  Nothing spectacular really, just good Japanese comfort food away from sushi, yakiniku, teppanyaki and the like.  This place reminds me of the mom and pop ramen shops back in Hawaii.  But to be totally honest, we actually came here because its Friday during lent and we aren't allowed to eat meat, so Fishy Fridays it is.  We started off with the agedashi tofu, baby tako and sunomono.  The baby tako was on hit!  Its not the whole red baby tako but sliced and pickled instead with a dab of siracha.  The agedashi was good but could use a little more saucy soup broth.  The cucumber and wakame salad was fresh and cold and complimented everything well.  Later we ordered the  hamachi kama, not a monstrous size, but good to go.  I can clean that bad boy like a whistle if I gotsta, best beleedat!  Though, its hard to get full since most of the dishes are small so mini sashimi, soft shell crab, uni, spicy tuna hand roll and amaebi with the fried heads were added.  I was debating on getting a veggie ramen, but concluded the meal with a roll, think it was called kiss a dragon.  The service is very friendly and reminds me of my aunties and uncs back home.  The place provided a welcoming feel that was nostalgic to island life.  Still, there was a pallet of different ethnicities there enjoying the good food and having a great time.  Lastly, we hit up desert with the sesame ice cream and Japanese cream puffs.  The sesame ice cream was unique and tasted like fried ice cream and very delicious.  The Japanese cream puffs reminded me of Liliha Bakery, just smaller and doused in whipped cream and topped with a  cherry.  For those of y'all that don't know, you better ax somebody!",

    "text": "LUV x 1000 + 1.  After seeing some reviews about this place being veg-friendly, I made the trip to the complete opposite end of town to try Miko's.  As much as it pains me to say it, it's a good thing Miko's is so far.... I would end up huge from eating their noodles every single day.  My husband and I sat down, and we were first asked if we were vegetarian before we were given menus.  A separate menu just for vegetarians!  And it was enormous!  Miko's gets a gold star!  After some deliberation, we decided to go for it and order more food than necessary.  We drove all this way, right?  We started off with the Veggie California roll.  I'm not going to lie- I scarfed this thing down so fast that I can't really get into the intricacies of taste... or what was even in the roll for that matter.  I just know that it was yum.  You can have the typical wasabi/ginger/soy combo to dunk your sushi in, but they also served it with a sweet miso sauce that I loved.  Next up, we had the Agedashi Tofu.  Out of everything we ate, this one was my least favorite.  The tofu wasn't as crispy as I was expecting and it was a pretty mild dish.  Not bad, just not as much of a \"wow\" as everything else.  My husband ordered the Gomoku-Yaki Udon and LOVED it.  Lots of thick yummy udon noodles covered in a flavorful sauce and served up with fresh veggies.  It was so good, I *might* have forced him to share.  I ordered the Ramen soup (insert the Hallelujah Chorus here).  I finally found a veg-friendly noodle soup bowl that tastes amazing!   Woo hoo!!  The Ramen is a gigantic bowl of thin noodles, roasted veggies, and a flavorful broth.  It was so nice to have on a chilly night and super filling.  And at $9.50, it's a steal.  My only complaints are that the veggie sushi prices are a little high (I never understand why veggies would cost as much as sushi-quality fish) and that there was a little too much pepper in my Ramen broth.    The restaurant is small and cozy inside and everyone working that night was very friendly and helpful.  We talked to the owner for a while and thanked him for making so many veg-friendly options.  It's definitely a godsend to find a restaurant in this town that goes out of their way for vegetarians like us.  I will be back for sure.",

They do have dishes that are Vegan/Vegitarian, but they do not go out of their way to make foods in separate areas.  They do take their time and will not rush to get food out, they want to ensure you are happy and satisfied.  But if you go in there thinking this is a Vegan/Vegetarian place and expect things to be done special, then I suggest you don't go.  The food is AWESOME, the owner is AWESOME and he will accomodate you as much as he can, but you MUST UNDERSTAND, this place caters to ALL and they will do their best to accomodate you, which in my opinion is more then most places in this town will do for you.    There are not a lot of Vegan/Vegetarian places, and there are even fewer that will take the time and pride in trying to accomodate your eating style.  Show appreciation to those places like this one that will, but don't fault or blame them IF Vegan/Vegetarian is not their bread and butter.  You will appreciate this place if you appreciate good food and great conversation with an owner who cares.",

We arrived at 5pm on Saturday (that's when sushi begins) and ordered the V-Hawaiian caterpillar and the V-tempura vegetable to start. I was so happy with the tempura vegetable! It had the perfect amount of crunch and freshness of flavors that I had been craving! Honestly, I didn't know what to expect and was very impressed! The Hawaiian was also excellent! It was a little different than what I'm used to because there is sweetness from the pineapple but it complemented the coconut and avocado so well! Such different and delicious favors! The service was exceptional as well. We met the owner, Greg and he offered us some vegetarian Mochi and the end of our meal. I found it quite nice that the owner would go out of his way to introduce himself to us and provide us with a sweet treat! We can't wait to come back again soon! Thank you!",

Second chances are not always given, but in this case it was and I am glad we did. When we first showed up here for our first visit it was a bit busy, but there was a table for us. The older gentlemen sat us, took our order, but forgot to put it in. He then did not come back to the table for a long time and at that point we found out he did not even put our order in and so we left. He told us he was sorry and offered to buy our dinner the next time we came in. Very nice of him, but we hesitated.   Next week came and my boyfriend wanted sushi. So we took him up on his offer and lone and behold...deliciousness. I do not eat sushi, but my boyfriend loved his. I could tell from his facial expressions for sure.   I had the Gyoza...amazing and the chicken and egg rice bowl which was also amazing. I love that dish and it was better then Ichiza's which I found hard to believe at first, but to me it was. I also LOVE their Miso Soup. I have never had it with the little noodles in it, but that is not why I loved it. I loved it because the flavor was so bursting and delightful that I could go there just to eat all their Miso Soup. Seriously, I love that soup.   We also went during happy hour which has $2 Sapporos. Can you say, yes please? I did, about four times.   The best part, besides the soup, was the company of their new Chef. Apparently his first day was the day we went the first time, but this time we sat at the bar and he chatted with us the whole time. I think his name is DK, so if you go there tell him Hello. He is a sushi artist. Like I said, I don't eat sushi but I love the way it is made and created and his was neat   All in all our second visit was so much better and we will be back! It is close to the house and delicious. I will try their teriyaki chicken next I think!   Second chances can be worth it sometimes !",

Its located in a strip mall- typical Vegas- and looks like most other Vegas sushi joints. The service was friendly and we were quicky seated. My eyes immediately fell upon the $2 Sapporo draft Happy Hour special (5-7pm only). Seriously?? On draft for $2?? Heaven I tell you... Clearly what I really needed after a long flight was a ice cold beer (and a cheap one to boot)..   Oh yeah the food- well that certainly did not disappoint. We ordered both ramen and sushi and were happy with both. The ramen was nowhere close to the best I've had. The broth lacked a lot of the richness of pork broths I've had and the solo egg and a few pieces of meat floating around was kind of sad (some other greens or something else in the bowl would have been nice). The sushi was tasty (try the Hawaiian roll) but not out of this world. Overall Mikos' is a solid choice and the best I've had in Vegas so far...Miko's I will certainly be back...",

    "text": "Miko's was the first stop on our drive entering Las Vegas from the Bay Area.  We wanted to check it out because it got 4-stars on Yelp and a lot of yelper's raved about it.  Who knew that their experience would differ from mine.  Although the people of Miko's is as nice as anyone can be, I was kind of disappointed with the food we ordered, namely the sushi.  We should have figured since this place is called an \"Izakaya\" and not a \"Sushi House\".  The rice for the sushi wasn't of high quality.  It was terribly starchy and tough.  My Uni Sushi didn't look right either.  I was hesitant to eat it but I did and it wasn't bad.  The sushi here is just OK.  As for the things I like about Miko's, well the Izakaya, the small portions of goodness that saved my experience at this restaurant.  Order the specials also.  They seem to do those pretty well.  The Salmon Collar was done perfectly.  I also liked the Miso Ramen.  When I go back to Miko's it will definitely be for appetizers, specials, and this gyoza I've been reading about.  This place can be a 5-star restaurant if it chooses to serve up the small plates of goodness only.  I hope though that when I do come back to Miko's that their sushi rice changes so I can reevaluate my review.  I was close to giving this place 4-stars because the people are so nice, but I couldn't live with myself if my review wasn't an honest one.  Review Update TBD...",

    "text": "It bothers me to have to write a negative review of this restaurant, because so much of the issues I experienced were avoidable.  For starters, this was my second visit. The first was decent but I distinctively remember the service being frustratingly slow even though the food was decent. The owner/manager abruptly stopped taking our order to say hello to new guests, even engaging them in conversation before returning to take the rest of our order -- without so much as an \"excuse me\" or an apology for stepping away.  When I arrived the sushi bar was half-full and there were only two other parties in the restaurant. Despite being fairly empty, the service was once again painfully slow. The food, while not terrible, was definitely not worth a 20-minute wait between each order and its arrival.   By the time I left the restaurant was full and I couldn't help but wonder why. There are plenty of great sushi spots in Las Vegas. While Miko's may be slightly less expensive than places like Hachi (Red Rock) and Sushi Tower (Flamingo/215), the quality of food is significantly lower. Osaka (S. Eastern or W. Sahara) is comparably priced but far exceeds Miko's in quality of food, service, and atmosphere.   Truth be told, for $26 or less one can have all-you-can-eat sushi that far surpasses Miko's in quality, service, and atmosphere at any number of restaurants - the best of which include Sushi Bomb (Tenaya/215), Kaizen (S. Eastern/Coronado) or Sumo 2 (Durango/Warm Springs).  So why Miko's? I certainly can't figure it out.",

They told us their sushi chef has been making sushi for 40 years! You can tell. It is GOOD!  The sushi always tastes fresh. They have this sort of 'real' wasabi that is just fantastic and way tastier than wasabi paste. They also recently started providing me with gluten free soy sauce which is just fabulous!  My husband often gets saki bombers and I get one of their flavored sake. All has gone great with the sushi.   Also, we often get the red bean mochi. It is small but the perfect end to a great meal.  The location is close to my home and there is always ample parking.   I highly recommend this place.",

My husband had the matsu combo with chicken teriyaki, tempura, kushiyaki and gyoza.  The chicken wasn't great...a little dry.  The tempura was pretty good...especially the zucchini and sweet potato.  The combo also came with desert - we had the red bean ice cream.  It was delicious.  Service was pretty good.  Miko and her husband are very nice.

Below are some of the reasons why I will never take myself or my family back to this restaurant.  1. Every meal we have eaten there we have been served and never   received individual plates. 3 people sharing a bowl of seawead salad   is not a pretty site.  2. I always have ordered the dinners and never have I received the   soup and california rolls. This last trip I mentioned them and the   waitress said \"No, I'm sure I brought them\". Even after I mentioned it   they were not brought out.  3. Plates are not cleared off of the tables. By the end of the meal,   all of the appetizer and sushi plates are all piled up and distracting.  4. Dinners are not brought out together. One person is half way done   with dinner while the rest of us wait. Not Good.  5. This last trip I was served raw poultry. I was vomiting the next   day at just the thought. After discussing it with the waitress they   never removed the plates and brought us new chopsticks. Yes we had to   eat with dirty chopsticks on dirty plates the rest of the night.",

The sushi is soooooo goooood and the cooked food is awesome too. Today we had Kobe roll, Tiger roll, rainbow roll, Karaage, Tempura and Yakitori Don and as always... just made our tummies happy and our night much better! All dishes are made to perfection and to please the costumer. My husband loves spicy food, so every time we order something for him they ask if we want to add a special \"spicy touch\" to what he ordered.  We've tried some other places in Vegas and we definitely pick  Miko's over any other options! We go there about 3 times a week and we can't get sick of it! It's really great! Every time they give us some sample of sushi so we can try new things. We never had anything we didn't like it!  Not only the food is great, but the whole crew is above and beyond being servers and cooks, they are our friends! Always friendly, they all have some spare time to talk to us about our daily life and take care of the place at the same time. We definitely consider Miko's our second home and an extension of our family! It's always a pleasure to see Greg, Miko, Allan, Ted, Sean and Saito San.",

I went here with a group of 7 people and was very surprised at the poor service which seemed rushed and nearly annoyed at having to serve customers. Mind you we were the only people in this place... Drinks were not refilled until I had to walk me and a friends glasses up to the counter to ask for refills. Food was alright... For the price I was not impressed with freshness or taste. Plates were not cleared as courses came out and again our server, a middle aged man, seemed angry and as though he was trying to rush us. Lastly on my second trip to the counter to request refills on water, I saw the same server opening a mochi package from trader joes and cutting the pieces into fourths. Knowing my friends just ordered a four or five dollar desert I was overall dissapointed in nearly every aspect of miko's. Worst of all my fiance reported to me later that night that he had gotten sick from his sushi. :/",

The team at Miko's combined FAST and efficient service with a total \"take your time\" attitude toward the diner.  In fact, Greg emphasized a definite \"slow food\" concept, but that did NOT mean that service was slow.  On the contrary, when I was ready for my sukiyaki, which often takes a LONG time to prepare, it was there.  Not only that, but it was served in the traditional Japanese style, with organic, bio-safe raw egg dip (don't worry, it's definitely optional!)

As a solo diner, I felt that Greg had made his home available to me, and he spent quite a bit of time chatting and keeping me company while I worked my way through the miso soup (clearly home-made...you can taste the freshness of the dashi and miso), simple yet YUMMY salad, beef tongue appetizer (tender bites...I am SUPER picky about tongue, and this was perhaps the only SLIGHTLY negative....it was a little salty and not as tender as I'm used to, but this was the first time I have ever heard of a Japanese beef tongue dish, so it may be that it is simply the way it's done, and it was still really tasty) the sukiyaki (GENEROUS beef portions, and a sublime treat on a cool night) and house sake which was served warm...not hot as many \"Japanese\" restaurants serve it....it's supposed to be warm, and that's just how it came.  Perfect.  So....we went back the next night together! This time, it was sushi/sashimi time.  EVEN BETTER! If there's ever a gauge of the quality of a sushi place, it is UNI.  You know how really REALLY fresh uni has jagged edges and a glow to it?  Bingo.  Probably among the absolute finest uni I have ever eaten.  And reasonable at $7.25.  Ikura was poppin'-fresh, and didn't have that sometimes-found cardboardy off taste...so good!  And the fresh scallop was creamy and delicious.  My wife ordered the hamichi \"mini-sashimi\" and loved it.  The grilled squid was cooked perfectly, and served with a lighter broth dip, instead of the mayo-based dip often found with yaki ika.  I wanted to keep eating, but was full to the brim.  As for atmosphere, don't expect elegant muted sound and koto music in the background...this is a family-oriented, family-run, family-cooked and family-served place in a neighborhood well away from the strip.  In a kind of ugly strip mall, which is all irrelevant if you're looking for great food, friendly yet unobtrusive service, the ball game playing softly behind the sushi bar, $2 Sapporo and Kirin at happy hour....I could keep writing, but you probably stopped reading a while ago.  Final word:  Price is reasonable...you get what you pay for and at this place, it isn't their rent...it's the food and the service.  Six stars!",

We enjoy siting at the sushi bar and watching them prepare their magic.  We have loved everything we have tried.  A must go to for sushi in Vegas!",

    "text": "A friend and I went to Miko's on Friday night. The place was very busy (a good sign!) so we sat at the bar. We had 3 rolls, some sushi a la carte, and agadashi tofu. I must say it was the best agadashi tofu I've ever eaten. The sushi was delicious and very fresh. Despite being busy, they were nice and welcoming. They made sure that although the restaurant was busy and the sushi chef was very busy, we always had something in front of us to eat. We got our sushi in 2 stages. I appreciated this: we didn't have to wait long to get something to eat!",

    "text": "As a military member, I served three years in Northern Japan and still remember the food that I enjoyed there. I ate at Miko's two nights straight while working in Vegas. It's the most authentic Japanese restaurant I've encountered in all of the United States. The Curry is out of this world and some of the best I've ever had! Make sure to call ahead a day if you want Curry, it's especially made for your visit. My fiance is a huge Sushi fan and she also enjoyed their selection. AWESOME FOOD AND A GREAT ATMOSPHERE!",
