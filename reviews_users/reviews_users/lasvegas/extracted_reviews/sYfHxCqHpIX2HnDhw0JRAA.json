Fair enough, i was seated at a table so i just ordered their dinner ny steak that came with all parts of a hibachi steak minus fried rice and minus the hibachi. What my server brought out( i dont know his name but he was asian and skinny, so ill call him Chad) was this abysmal excuse of a ny steak. It was thin as hell, like it just got done fasting for 48 hrs and THEN ran a marathon. The taste was non-existant. For $17, you would expect a decent steak, lets just say that memo was not given to ohjah. The meso soup that came with it was awful. The salad that came with it was very good because of their dressing. So if you want a tasty salad, try ohjah. But If you want a good steak come to my backyard and ill whip one up on the barbie! Nooojah is a no go but Chad was the shit!:)",

The food was fantastic and I'm completely in love with the soup that comes with the hibachi meals.  The salads were good, I'm not a huge fan of the dressing but my fiance enjoyed it (it's the first time I've ever seen him devour a bowl of salad like it was the main course).  The fried rice was fantastic, as were the chicken and beef that we got.  The couple seated next to us had lobster and scallops and they both said they'd come back just to get those again.    If I had to criticize anything, it would be that the veggies were a little bit too soft for my liking.  They didn't have as much flavor to them as the rest of the meal did.    On the way out, we were told \"Thank you, we hope to see you again\" or some varient of at least six times.  Talk about feeling like a valued customer.",

Also, my husband ordered the Seabass and it was absolutely disgusting!!! It was a very bad piece of fish that smelled AWFUL!!!! He didn't eat it. And when we let the chef know, he said he would let the manager know. But then we had a remind the waitress, who came back and took it off the bill. But he was never asked if he was still hungry or wanted anything else. They brought out the check and were never offered dessert. Looking forward to the Pecos and windmill restaurant opening up. We'll be back, because we've always had a good time here.",

The reason for my three star instead of five star rating is because of the \"extra charges\" they put on our last bill. We spent almost $200 on food, so to be charged for something like refills on the iced tea was very annoying! We were celebrating a birthday and anniversary, we asked the waitress if they would sing happy birthday. They sang and brought out a small piece of cheesecake, then charged us for the cheesecake! I have never been charged for a \"birthday\" dessert! I'm sorry but if I just spent almost $200 on food the least you could do is throw in the slice of birthday cake. I really like this place but charging us for those silly things will make me think twice about going there next time. In fact, the next time I have a craving I will try the hibachi place closer to my house.",

They were nice and were able to fit us into a table.    The chef we got was really good at cooking, but he had ZERO interaction with our table at all. He went through the motions and while it was all very impressive, he never smiled or laughed or acknowledged us. It was a bit strange.    The food was delicious!  We shared the Hibachi combo, with one basic to share, and it was the perfect amount. The scallops were cooked perfectly, as was the steak and shrimp.  I really wanted the oysters on the half shell or oyster shooters, but they didn't have any so ended up getting a \"screaming orgasm\" and that was okay. It was a very small portion compared to other places.   When most everyone at our table was done eating, the servers seemed in a rush to get us out, but we wanted to linger and try some dessert and drink more wine. It was a bit uncomfortable. They kept bringing our check and we kept asking for more things so they'd have to take it back. We were the only ones left at the table and I felt bad - I wanted to ask if we could move to a normal table since we weren't ready to leave yet, but the server told us we were fine, even though they kept bringing us our check lol.    All in all, the food was great, the service was fast, and it was a great birthday dinner.",

As we were about to place our order, a guy, maybe the manager, came over and said there was an opening for our party at a Hibachi table. We were so happy, and immediately got up and moved! The service was very good, quick and polite. They turned those tables around so quickly. The chief was very entertaining. And the food is always really good, and made to order right in front of you. Always a fun time!! Will be back for sure! Highly recommend this location!!",

Of course they card and make sure we are of age, but they keep the drinks coming! The food is always so great and stays consistent in taste and quality. I've been here at least 10 times for birthdays or just to dinner with my boyfriend and always had a great experience. You choose from a variety of entrees (I always enjoy the hibachi experience) which then comes with a salad, soup and veggies. After the food and a decent amount of drinks you can leave here with a 40$ tab which isn't bad at all. The hibachi chef's and servers are always friendly and keeping our water filled, plates cleared and drinks on deck. They serve sushi here as well, and usually perform some type of show for the hibachi experience. They toss veggies or extras left over from cooking into everyone's mouths and you catch it, which who doesn't want to see their friends get hit in the face with food? Lol. Great restaurant and fun place for a night out or special celebration. Request Jason as your server, although he is usually at the Durango location! He is the man (:",

My son wanted hibachi so we went here as a family my son ordered chicken with noodles. When it was done I said you like your chicken he said try it with a confused look so I did. I thought it was undercooked so I told the cook he put it back on the flatiron he did for a whole 2 min I tasted it again the chicken was clearly bad it was literally like rubber we could not even bite it. I told them and they didn't care I even had a complete stranger sitting next to us try it and she was wow that is awful. I talked to our waitress she was like well I'll remove the chicken but I have to charge you for the noodles I'm thinking wow what customer service. I then ask to talk to the manager he was like well we took it off the bill I'm like that not the point the point is that now my son has nothing to eat at that point i was disappointed in this place so before we leave my son says can I have a refill of apple juice and they say we have to charge you there's no free refills even after they just screwed up his meal so wrong. The worst customer service I've ever experienced horrible service. I highly recommend you stay far away from this place.",

There are so many tappanyaki restaurant and Ohjah has the best. The price is reasonable and the food is very good quality. The chefs are super fun and they definitely bring their unique tricks to grill. As for the regular menu side, it's a little more pricy but the food does not disappoint. I wish they offered All You Can Eat sushi, but they don't so getting the sushi platter or sushi boat would be the next best option. I love their sashimi and nigiri because their fish is really fresh. However, if someone your party doesn't eat sushi, they may not enjoy the selection on the regular menu and it would be more ideal to eat on the tappanyaki side of the restaurant. Lastly, I would have to say that the service is a little better on the regular menu side than the tappayaki side. It seems as though the waiters are a little slower and distracted on the tappayaki side. But on the regular menu side, I have to give two thumbs up to the waiters. Often times you order sushi at restaurants and there seems to be a language barrier or something, but here at Ohjah they usually understand what you're ordering and they rarely get orders wrong. I give the waiters a lot of credit for knowing their menu well.",

They separate the meats by section and individual price so that you can mix and match your plate however you want. I chose the NY strip steak and the shrimp. My sister tried the scallops and NY steak. MY father tried the sukiyaki beef and NY steak, and my brother in law tried the Salmon and chicken.   You start with the $8.95 basics which includes the the option of fried rice, steamed rice, or noodles, soup, and salad. This is MANDATORY for teppanyaki. Then you pick from the list of meats you'd like and you just mix and match. They also offer kobe beef at $50 and lobster tail also at $15. The dishes and offerings are typically what you'd expect for teppanyaki. Same quality and flavor. Next time I would love to try the filet minon instead as I wasn't too fond of the NY strip steak. It was tougher and less flavoring. The sukiyaki beef is A GOOD CHOICE. They're full of flavor, tender, and juicy!   Our chef was great, He was funny, and very patient with obnoxious children. So big ups to him. For a total of 4 people plus an order of a glass of reisling and tempura ice cream we spent a good $100.00. Woohoo! What a deal! That's compared to my tab at Musashi which was $160.00 for 2 people! Same quality of food. Same service. Cheaper price. Call me a fan! I'll be back soon!",

The prices are right, the service and cooks are awesome - genuinely nice people there.   On a couple occasions if we found ourselves waiting for a bit for a few other people to join our cooking area, they've offered a free appetizer or a free drink. Not sure if that is official policy but it definitely was nice.   The food is amazing. My girlfriend regularly gets the Salmon. I get Lobster and Filet.  Only have had a couple of the sushi rolls, mainly go there for hibachi, but they were great!  Always a fun atmosphere, always someone's birthday.   If they could fix ANYTHING it would be to get a better birthday song for their iPod. Man. It's bad. And you'll hear it 1-5 times during your visit.   Beyond that, excellent place.

    "text": "Had to eat here twice to fully encompass the whole experience. The first visit was the plain old sushi lunch.  Food was good but nothing spectacular, but spicy tuna rolls, tempura, and edamame all seem to taste the same everywhere after 3 or 4 tall asahis.  Second time I came for the tepanyaki.  The chef was very polite and friendly.  Engaged us but wasn't intrusive in our dinner in any way.  Had the filet and shrimp (both cooked perfectly)  Overall this place is clean, food is above average compared to other sushi establishments, service is great, and it's up the street from where I lay my head.  Only reason I can't give 5 stars is I still have to pay for the food.",

    "text": "The hardest thing to achieve in a restaurant is consistency.  Often we go somewhere and LOVE it, then the next time its blah.  Not the case with Ohjah!  We go there about every 2 weeks and its ALWAYS AWESOME.   Sometimes the company is better than others,  some chefs are more skilled with the knives than others, but the FOOD is Always PERFECT.   You won't hear me say that too often, so trust me when I do.  The pricing of the menu is more competitive than other Japanese steak houses.  Its $8,95 base price for the rice veggies and soup, then you ad your meats.  We usually have the Filet Mignon plus either shrimp, scallops, chicken or halibut.  The filet is like meat flavored butter, melts in your mouth.   Actually I wish they used a little more butter in the prep, but its always flavorful and healthy.   We do usually get a tuna sashimi but I will say this.  the fish is fresh and yummy, BUT its cut in too large of chunks.  I prefer a smaller cut for a more delicate taste and feel.  We ate at the sushi bar once and all the fish was cut too large.   Nevertheless,  the The steakhouse, hibachi grill is the BEST in town for the BEST price.  I highly recommend it any day.",

    "text": "My wife and I joined friends at Ohjah Japanese Steakhouse (Blue Diamond and Decatur) recently. I was a little hesitant about the restaurant choice because I've never had a taste for sushi, but the majority rules, so I agreed. It was the night before New Year's Eve, and the restaurant was pretty much filled. Chefs were putting on shows at many tables. Patrons were clearly enjoying themselves; the restaurant was buzzing with laughter and excited chatter. Our service started off a little slow, but soon we had our appetizers. Everyone in our group had sushi; mine, thankfully, was cooked. And it was very good! Between the delicious appetizers and the salad, I was enjoying myself in spite of my earlier reservations about going to a restaurant known for its sushi. I could have left at the point and been very satisfied.   But then the chef - I believe his name is Van - came over to our end of the table and started an amazing display of acrobatic and culinary showmanship that was a joy to watch. He introduced each element to us and was soon flipping things into the air and even flipped a cup into his hat all the while keeping a fast beat with his cooking tools. Fascinating to watch! The scallops and shrimp were excellent, and the vegetables were cooked and seasoned to perfection. But the standout was the steak. The most tender and flavorful steak I've had in years. Melt-in-your-mouth with no fat or waste at all. And we had more than enough to take home for leftovers.   We left late, and as the chef and then the waiter cleaned the table, we asked what they were cleaning with. Lemon juice, they said - no chemicals. That impressed us. And he said they would clean it again the next morning. Overall, we were very impressed. Delicious food, very clean restaurant (even the restrooms were immaculate), friendly service and a terrific show, too. The Ohjah at Blue Diamond and Decatur is definitely worth revisiting.",

This last experience is what dropped my rating. While eating I found hair in my rice. I showed it to the waitress and she was nice and apologetic. So was the chef. They asked if I wanted them to take my plate away.  She then offered to remake the dish. I told them yes but asked for it in a to-go container since the rest of my party would be finishing up by the time I got my food.   Throughout this process I was extremely polite and understanding. As gross as it is.. I understand that things happen. I received my to-go order and my bill... 100% of my bill. Due to the inconvenience of having to wait for my food I believe I should have received some sort of discount. I'm naturally passive but someone else in my party felt it was unacceptable and requested it on my behalf. The manager offered 10%.... $3 and some change.   When I got home and checked my order... the protein portions were incredibly tiny. Nothing close to what you would receive dining in. Tasted fine though and no stray hairs that I could find.   Just overall bad service recovery experience. Due to cleanliness concerns and this last experience I probably won't return.",

Have you ever seen someone throw an egg and crack on on the edge of a spatula without humpty dumptying it (it's a word)? What about lighting an onion volcano on fire with their finger? I have and it was awesome. Our Hibachi chef has been cooking Hibachi for years and it showed not only in the entertainment, but in the food.He was self deprecating and very funny, but more importantly the New York steak and filet were cooked perfectly. No, Seriously, melt in your mouth perfection. The chicken was also fantastic. We took our kids with us and he took the time to cook their portion of the steak slightly longer and cut the steak to the perfect size for even the tiniest of our enthusiastic eaters. We also had a killer waitress who kept our drinks topped off the entire time and was very sweet to our children.   I've done hibachi at many restaurants. This was by far my favorite hibachi experience ever. I would go back in a heartbeat.",

We came here on a Sunday 6 pm but hibachi table was all full. Have to wait at least an hour. They do not serve hibachi food if you sit at regular table. So I highly recommend making a reservation or call ahead if you're going for hibachi.   The service was great, the manager was very friendly and polite explained to us about the wait. Our chef was also fun and engaging. We get to see lots of cool tricks as usual.   Food was just alright. The crave for hibachi is all about that buttery garlic soy sauce fried rice! But it was kind of tasteless and missing the rich butter and garlic taste. Disappoint.. but the shrimp and filet mignon was good. I recommend adding garlic butter with your steak - Yum!   Overall experience - not impressed. It's just what you can expect at an average hibachi restaurant. If we're craving for hibachi next time, we'll probably go for Benihana since now it's open in Vegas!",

    "text": "Today was their grand opening day and I couldn't have been any more excited! I pass by this place everyday and was anxious to try this new restaurant on Decatur and Blue Diamond. On my way home from work, I saw their \"Open\" sign lit up so I called my husband right away and told him to meet me there for dinner.  We were greeted warmly when we walked in and were asked if we wanted to sit at the bar, a booth or if we wanted hibachi. We opted for hibachi. The hibachi room was huge and there were eight cooking stations.   My husband ordered the Special Rolls Combo for $23.95 and got the Dragon Roll, Spider Man Roll and Kamikaze. I ordered the Filet Mignon hibachi which came with vegetable teppanyaki, house salad, miso soup and your choice of fried rice, fried noodle or steamed rice for $16.50.  The sushi was pretty good... Normally my husband and I like raw fish but since I'm pregnant, he ordered all cooked rolls. I especially liked the Dragon Roll because the salmon was cooked with a nice charred taste. I think I may be used to AYCE sushi so I don't think I sushi would be my first choice when I come back.  I enjoyed my hibachi meal and our chef was entertaining. I watched three different hibachi chefs and it looked like they all had their own tricks up their sleeves. The house salad was good but they were a little too liberal with the dressing. I enjoyed the Filet Mignon very much because the meat was tender and flavorful and cooked to my preference.  I was too full to order dessert but I want to try the tempura ice cream next time. The only three dessert items are ice cream, mochi ice cream and tempura ice cream.  The service was top notch even though they had a lot of patrons. We were checked on regularly and we didn't have to wait long for our food or our check. The service was surprisingly good for a restaurant's opening day!    I will be back again since this place is super close to home. I'm so glad this place that I have been keeping tabs on is finally open! Ohjah was definitely worth the wait!",

Excellent menu, fast friendly service. Reasonably priced drinks and appetizers. The sushi is fresh and delicious. The only drawback is it is not open until 3pm, I tried coming here for lunch on a Saturday and it was not open. But dinner is terrific, check this place out!!",

I can only comment on the Sushi Bar since I have not tried the Teppan. I am a Nigiri Sushi addict. I am a big fan of everything in the refrigerated case in font of me at this sushi bar. So if you ask me what I like, I can just point to the general area of the fish and say \"all of that.\" The only thing that I have found that doesn't blow me away, and this is strictly a personal preference, was the cure on the Saba. Still better than many others though. The daily specials on the board are well worth the price and I have not been anything but satisfied with anything I have ordered from it. I usually order an appetizer, a meal, and whatever fancies me from the specials board and I am happy.  They have great deals to fit whatever mood you are in. The service is always friendly and attentive.  The restaurant is always clean. The last time I visited it sounded like a party in the Teppan area. I have to try that next visit.",

Tonight we went back the waitress took our order my friend order the steak and shrimp i ordered the chicken w rice AND noodles my friend never got her shrimp and i didnt get my rice. When we asked our waitress again she didnt seem to care. My rice was whatever because i had noodles but half my friends meal was missing and she shared her rice with me. I dont know if the customer service is below what it should be because they are growing so fast or what but we have been going to the Decature location since it opened.",

We used to frequent more often than now, so we hadn't been in some time, but I have been to this location well over fifteen times.  Let me start off by saying the food here is definitely good. I cannot comment on the sushi, as I have never had it but the hibachi is always solid. Tonight we went and things seemed weird.   It seems like Ohjah is getting cheap with their product. First, the chef told me he wasn't allowed to use extra garlic on my shrimp (or really use any garlic at all) because it is not procedure and he would get in trouble. Apparently management/ownership was getting annoyed with people asking for extra items and not paying. I would gladly pay for extra rice, veggie, etc. But garlic?! How expensive can a tablespoon of garlic really be. I would have paid for it had he said \"garlic is extra\" but he didn't; he just made it clear he wasn't allowed to use any garlic on ANY meat item other than steak..... Okay.   Second, I have never counted the shrimp I get on my plate, but I would say they used to give you 8-10 shrimp per order. Today I got 5. Once again, okay.   This was not the chefs fault by any means. I just feel as though ohjah is getting a little skimpy on their food. Hibachi is not cheap, so I will likely take my business elsewhere next time where they will gladly add garlic to my food.",

The owner was very understanding and set up a reservation for us to come back. We came for a late lunch around 3:30pm before the rush. The manager greeted and sat us on the hibachi side and the staff was very accommodating. We had Keith as our chef (aka \"Hello Keithy\" he said, which was pretty catchy) and he remembered us from a previous time. He's always very nice, friendly, and in a happy mood which is always a good sign. I do think that the staff's mood is a big part of setting a guest's experience. He was able to add extra garlic to my meal without acting like it was a hassle (which the previous chef was not happy about when I asked last time). My friend and I both had the shrimp and NY steak and it was very flavorful and well prepared. Next time I come in I'll definitely request Keith again.",

The chef came and he was AMAZING, older gentleman, Devon or David we believe we heard his name was, had 30 years under his belt and his skill showed that yet he still acted like it was just as fun as day 2. So funny and jokes were everywhere, such a good time. The manager was incredibly nice as well having come over to check on us after we were served food.   Really, no complaints. However, it is very different from other hibachi places we've been, taste wise. Different, not bad. And the prices were awesome, $40 for just the two of us. We'll definitely be back.",

The \"crust\" in which the ice cream is wrapped was not to my taste so I mostly ate the green ice cream...not bad on it's own but not a fav.

I understand there are other families in the group and of course we don't want to keep them waiting but both times, the others have barely ordered their appetizers and with two littles ones..we have to get ourselves situated and be able to read the menu while fighting with usual \"kid\" stuff at the table.

We got the lunch special that was actually a really good deal! This place doesn't do AYCE and most of the places we go to do.

I can't remember the name of the roll I got, but it had a mango salsa on top. It paired really well!  I want to come back to this place for more sushi and to try the hibachi! Definitely recommend it!",

That was the lightest and best tasting roll I've had.  That's ideal for a quick lunch or a light dinner.  Very refreshing!  Definitely a will go back and I highly recommend trying that roll.

You choose three different sushi rolls and it comes with sashimi as well for $45- which I think is cheap compared to other places.  Their Rock N Roll roll was a refreshing taste, it had salmon, tuna, avocado, and yellowtail wrapped in cucumber (a big roll but still tasty).  Their baked mussels are juicy and tender.  The service here is amazing. They're very attentive and always remember you whenever you visit :)",

    "text": "I don't think of hibachi places as big draws, especially for the foodie crowd. So, I was surprised to walk into Ohjah on a Friday night and see the place packed. It's also a sushi joint, but that side of the restaurant had a few open tables. The hibachi side was filled. That's impressive considering they had six cooking stations.  The basic hibachi dinner ($8.95) consists of standard fare -- vegetables, salad, soup, and fried or steamed rice or noodles. I added shrimp ($5.75) and a 5 oz. filet ($7.55) to the mix. The shrimp was pretty good and the filet was cooked medium rare, as ordered, and was tender, as expected.  The best way to judge any hibachi place, though, is the entertainment factor. Our chef -- an older guy -- was ok. He was friendly enough, but all the tricks he did were the same standard ones you see at any hibachi place -- tossing the egg shell in the hat, the onion volcano, etc. He also tossed shrimp to some of the guests (again, a standard hibachi trick) but only to the guys, which disappointed some of the women at the table.  If you like hibachi places, you'll like this. If you don't, you probably won't be a fan. While it's similar to many others I've been to, I'd recommend this place for a fun night out whether or not it's with a date or a family.",

For appetizers, ordered the seaweed salad which was on par with typical sushi spots.  Ordered the $48.95 dollar sushi boat + hibachi for our main entree. Presentation of the boat was good, except the sushi tasted just a-ok, nothing special compared to other sushi places we have gone to. The sashimi wasn't bad either, but didn't rise to the top. The tuna & salmon --- just okay.  The biggest upside is the hibachi. Having the chef cook in front of you never gets old to me. The hibachi basic + add-ons were all very tasty, although we noticed the cook did add A LOT of butter when he cooked.  Overall, you should have a good time here. But if you want better tasting sushi in Las Vegas, you're better off at Oyshi, Sushi Tower or Nobu (on the strip).",

OK! who tells that to customers? That's exactly what we plan to do (we had a party of four) we intended on enjoying the evening with dinner and drinks. Hellllo!! once we got to the table the plates were dirty we had to get them switched out. We order drinks and again my glass was extremely dirty. I ordered a long island ice tea but really it was a lemonade with a shot of rum WTF. So I got a new drink, this time it was a coke and rum. I just came to the conclusion that the bartender didn't know what the hell he was doing. I was tired of complaining and ordering the same drink with no results. I hope they get it together. The waitress was nice and patient and I understood that it was not her fault. The chef saved the day because he was fun and a great cook.",

    "text": "I have been here several times for hibachi dinner and I can tell you that your dining experience here will depend on which chef perform/cook your meal. One chef will give you a 5 stars experience while the other one will make you question yourself for why the hell you're spending a lot of money for a lousy meal.  My regular and favorite chef is the tall skinny (Viet) chef who always does an excellent job entertaining guests and also make a good meal. When you go to a hibachi dinner, you expect entertainment in addition to good food. As for the other chef who cooked one of my meals, granted he was very nice, he basically just focused on cooking the food and not very entertaining at all. Even worse, the food was salty and just overall not good.  Since you are sharing the hibachi cooking table with other guests, I'm not sure if you can choose which chef will cook your dinner. Due to this reason, I am now less likely to take my guests here for dinner, which is too bad since this experience is unique and could be a lot of fun compared to strip buffet.  If you plan to come here for hibachi dinner, make sure you understand the rule of roulette. Your dining experience could land on red or black, and sometimes green :-)",

    "text": "My love and I heard good things about other Ohjah locations so one night we decided to check out the newest location on Blue Diamond, close to our home. We love sushi and hibachi and have ate at many hibachi type restaurants in and out of Las Vegas. So I was excited and had high hopes of a new restaurant close to home. When we first arrived I noticed the interior, it's beautiful, classy and not the typical Japanese decor that so many other places in town aim for. We were seated and I immediately noticed not only the wonderful smell of others already enjoying their meals, but the menu. Every item is al a cart, reasonable and inexpensive. Considering that we have spent well over $100 at like restaurants in the past for a party of two, I was presently surprised and already liking this place. But let's be honest, if the food is crap.....the prices really are irrelevant right?   So, we both ordered different meats to try more of the menu. Me chicken, he steak. The chef came out and was fantastically funny, sweet and incredibly skillful while cooking. It still blows my mind the cracking and throwing of eggs lol. Anyways, back to the food. It was great! The rice was fluffy, the vegetables were tasty and the meat was cooked to perfection. We have since ate here many times and we have never been let down, I have tried all of the meat/fish items on the hibachi menu and they're all equally delicious. Did I mention I don't think our bill has ever been over $60 including tip? I haven't tried the sushi because the hibachi is so very good it's hard to try something else, when we usually only go there because that's exactly what were craving. I recommend everyone check out Ohjah on Decatur and Blue Diamond.",

We came in around 9pm and had a reservation for 7 people and was seated right away. We sat down and watched the show but as soon as the chef placed food in our bowls (within 10 minutes), the waitress immediately asked if we wanted to go containers as well as desserts and immediately handed us the checks without even asking if we were through. She seemed to be in a hurry to get us out. Towards the end, I approached a gentleman and asked to see the manager; he claimed he is the the manager on duty, and his name is Lee. I gave him a feedback with regards to our bad experience and while talking, the waitress with a very bad attitude (TRAN), butt in the conversation and said \"oh I thought you're finish\" (in a very rude way). She even said she assumed my friend asked for a box when in fact Tran was the one who approached all of us while she saw we were still working on our food. Lee stood aside and let Tran keep on talking to us as she was starting to raise her voice. I expected that if a customer were to address their concern to the staff of the restaurant, the manager should at least stop TRAN from talking directly to the customers as it can only make matters worse but they let her reason out even more. She was very unprofessional and the situation could've been dealt with in a different way by the manager.  We came in to celebrate a party and drove all the way from CA and left very disappointed.Towards the end, we've come to conclusion that Tran must've had the audacity to behave the way she did because a gratuity of 18% was already included so she provided us a very lousy service. In my opinion, she did  not even deserve a $1 tip! Though the food was good and the show was quite entertaining, I won't be returning. I gave the star a place because they are lacking effort into trying to make this better (especially starting with proper training of their wait staff).",

When it was our turn, the chef really impressed us. The food was well seasoned with soy sauce love and lots of jokes. His tricks were really cool such that my siblings were begging for more. Sadly, it had to end. But, hey I'll be back to try their sushi menu cuz who doesn't enjoy a great customer service!",

The cooks came out and fried the veggies and cooked and friend the rice and then cooked the filet mignon. The fried rice was so good! The best I have ever tasted and the filet mignon was cooked to perfection. I would recommend!",

    "text": "I'm very surprised to see all these really good reviews because the last 2 times we have been here the service and chef have been absolutely horrid ! The manager (not sure if he's the owner ) is never friendly to say the least . I wish I knew the name of our chef the last 2 visits but it's hard when he doesn't wear a name tag or introduce himself . There were 2 families at our table . Between us there were 3 kids 5 and under . A show for the kids , friendliness , etc . , Is way too much to ask for from this chef . 7 out of the 8 orders were only broccoli or mushrooms only not all the veggies . The chef was irritated , said luckily he wasn't hungover, and that we weren't an easy table . We asked for particular sauces . The chef got ours but the guy from the other party requested double of a certain sauce as well . The chef snapped at the guy , said they didn't have that sauce , gave them the sauces they didn't want , and then began cooking as quickly as possible . The tables had people but they had chefs to cover it . This guy has zero personality and rushes through the cooking process . The shrimp was not thoroughly cooked . My salmon wasn't raw but it could have used a few extra minutes of cooking . Our steaks we asked for well done . My husband ordered double filet well done . It wouldn't hurt the cook to actually cook the steak how my husband would like it cooked but that would take too much time . He puts it on my husbands plate , doesn't ask how it is , cleans the grill , and is gone before my husband even has a chance to look at his steak to see that it's definitely medium / medium rare . No where near what my husband asked for . The manager could care less , says he will take my husbands meal off the bill , picks it up , and rushes off with it ?!? Umm , we were there to EAT ! Have you thought that maybe my husband would like to actually EAT and you should offer to cook his meal longer so he can EAT! After the Manager walked off even the other family at the table told me I was exactly right and the chef couldn't have been more rude or in a rush . :(",

As we enter, a really nice and cozy type of japanese resto with a dim light approached us. Our server which was also really accommodating, walked us through our table and got our orders..   We let my uncle order since they know what's good there besides, it's their go to place whenever they're craving for japanese food..  They served us tea and salad (I love their salad) for starters..   Moments later, they served us the order.. it was the \"ohjah boat\" consist of sushi, sashimi and nigiri.. a tempura and I forgot the other one actually.. I really love the presentation of their boat and all the food tasted so fresh and mouth-watering..   (Just a warning: for those of you who are sashimi or nigiri lovers.. there's a parasite warning in the news and you should watch out or just be careful ordering or making some sushi these days, unless you're sure on the resto or where you buy it from..)  but other than that, I believe that this resto is safe and clean!

The fried rice was some of the best I've ever had and the filet mignon was so tender and good. The onion soup and the house salad they bring out when you first sit down was very good as well. The servers were very attentive and super nice. The owner or manager was very attentive and friendly as well.

    "text": "The ojah hibachi is a restaurant that my bf and i truly enjoy. The food is good and the shows are always fun. There are some wonderful chefs like the sir in the yellow hat who is our favorite. HOWEVER, today I had an unpleasant experience with a newer, inexperienced employee.  We brought our friends here and the chef we were given was inexperienced not just for the hibachi show (which wasnt much of a show), but apparently also in cooking. We noticed first that he burned the egg and the portion sizes of food was not enough for the table of 9 people... to the point some people had remnants of vegetables....  The vegetables were not fully cooked- cold and too crunchy. The noodles were ill seasoned.  My boyfriend ordered a rare stake (we also had rare filet yesterday) and it was RAW. NOT RARE. THERE IS A DIFFERENCE. It was cold like fridge cold in the middle, half was cooked rare and the rest raw. Rare steak is not supposed to be Cold!!!We had filet at Mon Ami Gabi yestrday and it was no where near that infact it was perfectly cooked.  After confronting the manager he kindly went to make a new one for us.  Then. THE PREVIOUS CHEF CAME TO ARGUE WITH US!!!!! HE DIDN'T EVEN APOLOGIZE JUST STRAIGHT UP ARGUING!   The manager apologized for the chefs behavior and generously compted the steak meal. As well as preparing a better one.  I normally love the hibachi here and the chef in the yellow hat, but this one chef was just inexcusable. Thankfully the manager did his best to help resolve the situation. And also, I do realize that some situations isnt necessarily the restaurants fault but sometimes employees mistakes, the food was still pleasing and at least the rest of the crew was still kind and concerned about our enjoyment- which I do appreciate. The manager even called us later to apologize which is a very honest and respectable thing to do, I appreciate and accept the apology. I know it wasn't his fault.",

The teriyaki salmon is my favorite from the lunch menu. I crave it and its greatly priced. Also the shrimp tempura, must get.   I love taking friends from out of town to hibachi, they feel like we are really going all out at a fancy Vegas restaurant. I'm like a kid watching them cook in front of me.   My mom tells me i need to stop telling people about her favorite restaurant. Lol :)",

I like the fact that you get a good sized meal for a fair price and the staff is always friendly and attentive. I would like this place even more if they carried brown rice, but unfortunately they don't.  I highly recommend this joint If your in the area looking for a quick bite and don't want to spend more than $15 on a meal.",

I have eaten hibachi in and gotten food to go and every time is great. Salmon Teriyaki is divine. The veggies are perfect and even the soup broth is amazing, deep rich flavor. Hibachi is really fun and would be a great place to take a group. Prices are so reasonable for what you get. The interior is really cozy & romantic even though you can't tell from outside.

They've got a great selection of appetizers and sushi on the menu. If you don't like raw fish they serve a large variety of cooked food as well such as chicken terriyaki or noodles. This place never seems to disappoint. I'm always a satisfied customer !!!! Plus, I love the service and the attentive servers.   Note - I usually order the sashimi salad, its spicy here though. I love that b/c it gives the salad an extra kick. Most sashimi salad I've tried aren't spicy at all, so this place makes it extra special. Different !! The baked green mussel are delish and a must order !! Needless to say, the sushi of course is off the hook !!",

Walked in about 5 o'clock pm and the manager was standing right at the front counter and did not acknowledge us for about 2 min. He finally asked us how many people we had after a line had formed behind us. We tell him we have two people for the grill, he says \"you want hibachi?\" Yes that's why we asked for the grill. He picks up his notepad and tells us not until 7 o'clock and then he just ignores us. I asked him if he was going to get my name and he says \"you're going to wait 2 hours?\" WHY DO YOU THINK IM ASKING YOU???? We had no problem waiting. The manager is rude and does not have any customer service skills. We decide to call the PECOS LOCATION and they politely tell us a time which was only 30 min from when I called so we head over to that location. WOW the difference in management is evident as soon as you walk into the door. GO TO THE PECOS LOCATION you will not regret it but you will regret going to the one on Decatur.",

I am not a fan of salad, but I loved this!! It is really sweet and doesn't taste like any other dressing I've ever had. Each order comes with soup, salad, vegetables, and the choice of fried rice, noodles, or steamed rice.  The basic entree is $8.95 with the items listed above, then you add whatever else you want. For example, I ordered Filet Mignon and Shrimp Teppanyaki which added $13 to the basic price. I like the menu style because it is  \"Mix & Match\" so you can create the perfect meal.  The steak was delicious and very good quality. The shrimp however had a very strong shrimp taste which I don't like. (I am very picky about shrimp!) After dipping them in one of the sauces provided it was better. Finally, the fried rice was delicious!!  Overall: Delicious and inexpensive teppanyaki dinner! I would say they are in the top 3 :)",

    "text": "I've been here a couple times before and I always felt like the man at the door, not in uniform who I assume is either the manager or the owner of the place is kinda unfriendly, but today he was just straight up mean and rude to me and my little nephew. We came in around 6:30 for dinner and I realized the place was packed as soon as we walked in. I saw him as I entered and asked if we could have hibachi for 2. He said \"No, we're full but there are tables out here\". I thought his response came across very short and uninviting. I promised my nephew who I don't get to see often a fun dinner where he would get to see the hibachi chef do all kinds of cool tricks and now that's not happening so I'm trying to figure out if my nephew wants something else there like sushi or teriyaki or ramen, etc...and while I'm asking my nephew what he wants that man rudely interrupted me: \"are you eating here?\" And I swear there was no one waiting behind us. It's not like we were holding up the line. Anyways, my nephew said he wanted sushi so we stayed and got one of the tables in the regular dining area. We got water right away but then sat for about 15 minutes before that same man came to check on us and take our order. As I ordered the chicken teriyaki, he asked if I wanted white rice or fried rice. I turned to ask my nephew if fried rice is ok since he'll be sharing some of my food, and he was a little distracted so before he could answer my question, the man just grabbed the menus on the table from under my arm and walked away angrily. I thought that is extremely unprofessional and disrespectful of customers. His attitude was just indescribably rude and so uncalled for towards me and my little nephew. If he doesn't have the patience to serve, he shouldn't be working in a customer service job. First of all, the food is ok, not that impressive to begin with. I've been to many different teppanyaki places before and I've had better.  Second, I'm paying to eat there. It's not like I'm there begging for free food. I didn't pay to get treated like that. I am extremely and absolutely angry, disgusted and displeased with the offensive service I received at this Ohjah today and will definitely NEVER COME BACK!",

I don't know if it is the chefs or just them catering to the other people at the table.... No show... No fire... No flavor... No nothing!!!!! It's pretty sad when I have to add salt and a half bottle of soy sauce to my own food!!! I will not come here again... Seriously disappointed that they just suck!!!! It ruined my whole night!!!!",

The front dining area has tables, as well as seating along the bar. We sat in the side room at the hibachi grill.   The food was great..I ordered the shrimp & chicken hibachi with fried noodles. My friend ordered shrimp and filet mignon with fried rice..everything was cooked to perfection. The hibachi chef, waitress, and bartender were all friendly and accommodating.   I only gave 4 stars because the price to have Seabass as an add on in your habachi was higher than I would have expected. I would absolutely go back and recommend to others.",

The only criticism was the fried rice was a little hard, so it needed some more cooking.  The service was excellent.  Overall, a very good meal.  HUGE UPS for seating me at the hibachi grill, even though I was the only one ready to eat.  I have never understood why so many Japanese steakhouses won't fire up the hibachi for only one person, but Ohjah did for me and I appreciated that.",

I am from Eastern NC, so I typically like my fried oysters in a light batter.  The fried oysters batter was very thick and greasy.  It was also served with BBQ sauce.    Dinner: The salad dressing that they serve is different.  It's almost like a mayo based ginger salad dressing.  It was not my favorite. I like that the portions are not HUGE, so you could actually finish it.  I like that the chef was VERY accommodating of how I wanted my food to be cooked.  He was very happy to cook my food separately.",

The space isn't much to look at from the outside but as my mother always says, it's what's inside that counts! There are 3 types of seating..the Sushi Bar, regular dining off the menu and hibachi dining. We generally always go to hibachi.  The menu consists of the usual steak, chicken and shrimp but the also offer Kobe beef, lobster, salmon and scallops. You get your choice of fried rice or noodles and you start with onion soup and ginger salad. The salad dressing they use is amazing and unique.  We always each order a steak and split the lobster. Make sure to have them cook with garlic and give you a side of teriyaki sauce for your rice, you won't regret it!   We come here at least once every other month and it still feels like a treat. Can't wait to go back!",

Now their scallops and filet mignon were cooked perfectly. Now for a new place its always packed and thats a good thing, but if you were to compare to Geisha House i would pick Geisha House for food quality and Ohjah for the price. We also tried this albacore and fried onion sushi roll which was delicious. But the hibachi was lacking good sauces and their cooks were not that entertaining and the fried rice was ok.i will come back just dont know when i will say OHJAH is what im craving today.",

Three filets were ordered and cooked perfectly, I ordered salmon which was a bit dry but I used a dipping sauce which satisfied my taste buds. Serving portion is huge - no need to order any appetizers if choosing hibachi. We also ordered a bottle of Fuji apple sake, only 8% alcohol so it's very weak.

I live right around the corner and tip every time i pick up food, so i don't understand the problem. Tonight was no different and when I picked my food up, I finally asked the man (the same curt person on the phone) if he didn't like takeout orders bc he wasn't very nice. He actually answered that it was a pain when they're busy!! He didn't even apologize and just continued to be rude. The food here is quite good, I order takeout several times per week, and it's one of the better sushi places in town, but they're so rude and clearly don't appreciate my business, so I won't bother with this restaurant again. Many more sushi places that are delicious and make me feel welcome.",

We each had the hibachi combination meals trying different selections and found all offerrings to be fresh and very flavorful. A minor error in our order was immediately corrected without fuss and the whole table benefitted with a taste  of the selected item cooked in error.We had anxiously awaited for the openning of Ohjah and were not disappointed.

However, I thought it would be a neat place to have my bday and bring 7 of my friends.  The day of my bday I called and asked if I could make a reservation for 9 pm.  They told me no, the only time they could fit me in was 8 pm.  A little too early, but I make my friends rush and we get there at 8 pm on the dot.  The employee at the front was SO RUDE, said there was no way i made a reservation because he was working   the phone all day and I didn't call, and then DEMANDS to see my phone as proof that I  called and made a reservation.  After I show him my phone, he says \"Was this today\"... umm it clearly is timestamped saying today. Then he says \"Well we have no room, you can come back at 9\". WHAT?! that was the original time I wanted and you said I couldn't have!?!?  Needless to say, he totally ruined my bday!",

So I asked if I could get the kids mean which is TINY, $14 dollars and doesn't even come with noodles. So I had to order noodles on the side which was another $3. I don't mind paying for what I want because I know they're a bit expensive, But they didn't want to change anything! The service ungodly awful. Refills took 10 minutes, horribly rude...

The waitress got our drinks took our order for an appetizer that came in 10 minutes. We then ordered a 3 roll  sushi special. That took 25 minutes to come. Way to long. We never were asked if we needed a refill on are drinks even when mine was empty. Then it took 20 minutes just to get the waitresses attention to get the check. After she brings the check she says do want a refill. ( ya right after I'm done eating) I said no that might take another 20 min. It took us an 1 hour and 20 minutes to get out of there on a single order. We will never go there again. Oh, and the people at the next table complained the the manager to. He gave them a free desert wow. Food was good but not worth the bad service and long wait time. We were there at 6pm",

    "text": "I've eaten here about four times in the last two months. Each time hoping to get a different experience. Obviously looking for a better experience from the time before. I never quite got the experience I was looking for.  let me quantify this entire review by saying I am a huge fan of Teppanyaki and Japanese cuisine. Every city I go to I always seek out some kind of Japanese restaurant. so when I move to my new house and saw that this restaurant was less than two minutes away I was super excited. My first experience I walked in with my brother before Christmas. There was no one at the hostess counter to meet me. When we told him it was for three people they just stared blankly at me and then told me OK you can wait. We sat there for a little bit of time and then finally were taken back to the hibachi tables. We were greeted promptly by the host of the actual table. He brought our drinks and took our orders quickly.  once we received our orders the show started and the chef was fabulous. My six-year-old son highly enjoyed it. It was what you would expect out of a typical hibachi show. The food was decent but not superb. Obviously I ate there multiple times so the food was extremely palatable but I have definitely had better flavors in hibachi cuisine at other places in town.  I received my receipt after payment and went on my way. My next experience was about three weeks after that. Taking my other brother there for sushi. We walked in and the host who is the gentleman seemed completely disgusted and appalled that we didn't have a reservation. He pointed to the small dining area in front of them and said \"you see these people they wait before you OK!\" And then he turned his back and walked away. Still not knowing how long our wait time was we kind of just hung out in front of the door. Shortly after another gentleman came up and said can I help you. We told him we were waiting for hibachi and he laughed and said\" oh no we know see you tonight. Two hour wait.\"so we left. my six-year-old who loves Japanese food was quite disappointed. But we try to give it another shot the next night. Hoping for either a different host and experience. When we were thinking about going back I called to make reservations this time. I made a reservation so that way we wouldn't have the same experience. But to my surprise when we arrived again they acted surprised even though my name is on the reservation list and sat me and told me we had to wait. Our reservation was at 7:30 PM. We ended up not being seated till close to eight. My confusion lies in the fact that if you make a reservation you should be seated around your reservation time correct? Obviously they should have a table waiting for you. Again we were seated and eight in the routine was the same. all in all if I'm in dire in desperate need for hibachi I'll go back. Ultimately the food is decent and it gives my son pleasure. But if I brought company back into town I definitely would not bring them to this restaurant.",

Price is just right as well. Decided to try the hibachi basic (salad, soup, rice/noodles, veggies) and the filet mignon, everything had great flavor. Our chef was a little more on the shy side compared to the others around us, but I think that may have been due to a language barrier, we still had a great time and enjoyed our meal. This place has definitely made out faves list can't wait to go back and try other items on the menu.",

We didn't have any so we had to wait 30 minutes.  Luckily there is a drug store next door you can pass the time in.  We were seated with a lovely family of 6.  All together there were 4 kids under 10 years old, our 2 teens (14 & 16 years old) and 4 parents.  The other Hibachi got the more enthusiastic chef.  Ours was just meh.  The fried rice made via Hibachi is always good but the meat (chicken) was kind of dry and tasteless.  I guess that's why they give you sauce.  What they did not give me was my free sake for checking in via Yelp.  I did order a salmon skin hand roll which was excellent.  I think they do better with their sushi than their Hibachi.  I'd probably return for their sushi, but I was not at all impressed with the Hibachi.",

Our friend met us there and hubby and I got there it was about 5pm and upon opening the door, there was no one there. No one. Customers or hostess.  Ummmmmm......so I walked to the left a little and realized that the hibachi area was around the corner in a different room.  We walked ourselves around the room then found hibachi area. I posted several pics.  Honestly it reminded me of the \"ol'school\" Benihana.......I just was not impressed. You have zero servers and if you get water or a drink you are lucky. The grill master Ven was suppose to be the best but just acted like he did not care that night.  I got the Sushi Fiji and hubby got the Prime hibachi. Mine was just a pile of unfrozen bay scallop looking fried madness and hubby kept telling Ven \"NO I'M ALLERGIC TO SHELLFISH\" when he kept trying to throw shrimp in his mouth.  Our friend order a roll and saki......he was also not impressed.  It is next to a new Lee's Liquor's that has craft beers.....that's another ball of GOOD YELP wax :)",

My friend and I decided to give this place a try, she had told me this place had so many good reviews and the pictures made us drool!!! YELP REVIEWS did not lie! This was so gooooooood!!  We started witht he Edame and the wontons.. Very delicious not that pricey about $3.95 each for appetizers..  Then for our entree we ordered the Ohjah boat which consisted of 3 rolls of your choice along with sashimi and seaweed salad for $49  And also we ordered the New York Steak Teriyaki..$14.99  From the moment they served the food we were in awe., Loved the presentation and love how the Boat full of sushi was huge! Loved the detail with the food presentation as well. The sushi was amazing! It melted in your mouth and you can tell the sashimi was fresh with the correct temperature without the VEINS popping in your mouth! As for the teriyaki steak it was to die for!  So in the end we couldnt finish everything.. we didnt even need to order appetizers we were so full we had so much left overs from the sushi and the steaks..  But of course we still made room for their famous tempura icecream which was so good!  I must say you can tell a huge difference when ordering from an all you can eat sushi place..   Ohjah is one of my top 5 japanese place and I will of course return  and will be a loyal customer!  P.S. they also have the hibachi tables if you are into that..",

My brother texted me that they made a reservation and they were like a couple minutes away. I tell the hostess we have a reservation under my brothers name. She tells me she seated them, which is weird seeing as how she told me I can walk and find them and came back and told her they were not there. I told her that no they are not seated and my party wasn't here yet. She preceded to tell me I was wrong as if I don't know wtf my family looks like. She raised her voice. It's not my fault you made a mistake. Luckily they weren't busy and sat us, but the whole experience was super frustrating. Also, the \"reservation table\" had the more experienced teppanyaki chef, which was a bummer... especially since it was my mom's bday, she would have enjoyed it a lot more. The chef we got was ok and he didn't seem too excited lol.",

When you do, request Van for your chef. His excellent skills provide lots of entertainment and the dishes were excellent. We had filet, New York steak, chicken teriyaki. I requested my filet be cooked rare which is somewhat difficult to do when they cut it up on a grill, but it was cooked perfectly. Very tender and juicy. The others enjoyed their meals as well. The onion soup is delicious and even the kids ate it although we didn't tell them it was onion. Loved the fried rice and the crisp tasty vegetables. Looking forward to the opening of their new restaurant November 15 as it will be a bit closer to home.",

    "text": "My review is on the Hibachi dinner, as we did not have sushi when we went. I do want to say that I become more and more dismayed at the number of sushi establishments that don't even offer a simple Spice Crab roll muchless a specialty roll with spicy crab in it. It seems when I ask for this 'unheard' of ingredient they look at me as if I have a third eye or something and unfortunately their answer to spicy crab = \"a california roll with siracha rolled into it\" is unacceptable. For those who do not know how to make spicy crab it is merely imitation crab stick chopped up just like they do for the crab salad with a tad bit of siracha and japanese mayo. The sad thing is that the easy way would be to just chop up a crabstick and mix it with the already available Spicy Mayo.... just sayin'   But I digress - the hibachi menu requires that you order the 8.95 base selection which is just your soup, salad, veggies and rice. Scroll down the menu a bit and it gives you the selection of meats and fishes that they serve Hibachi style. Kobe beef runs 48.95. We chose to have the Hibachi combo which allows you to choose 3 selections (excluding Lobster, Halibut and Kobe) but is a nice plethora of flavors that you can try as your meal.  The chefs are very entertaining, the meal is exciting to watch and the final outcome was really delicious. We didn't want for drinks until after the show was over and then we had to flag someone down a couple of times. Not terrible but they had spoiled us during the show serving us every time the glass became half empty.  I would definitely like to go back and see if they can do better with their response for Spicy Crab :-)",

Before our whole table was seated we had already been served soup and salad. The poor people next to us seated after had to eat all the appetizers while eating their dinner! During the hibachi cooking they brought us our check so we were unable to order anything additional and as soon as we finished our plates they were ready to walk us to the door.  Will probably be back at some point, but will be trying some other places around the area as well!",

And for Hibachi I recommend the shrimp, any of the steaks, and the fried rice. I wasn't really a fan of the chicken though... a bit dry for my liking.  Love, love, love this place.",

I give credit to the sushi chefs but other than that I will not be coming back here.  I don't want to be offended when I order the food I want-like I don't know what just came out of my mouth.

Had Chicken and Steak Teriyaki dinners - both were really good, love the soup - nice to get an onion broth rather than miso, salad dressing... what is in this stuff??? I'm in love - like typical habachi ginger/garlic dressing only creamier... also there was one little crab ragoon with the dinner that was super tasty. Steak was tender - chicken good too. Sushi was good, only tried a California roll to test them out - so can't really comment too much on the sushi. Husband had a couple hand rolls he liked. So all in all, pretty satisfied. They do seem to be a little pricy - but I was pleasantly surprised with the meal.",

We had to drive a little ways since we were staying at Treasure Island but it was definitely worth it. The sushi was very decently priced and yummy. Our hibachi cook was very good. The filet mignon was so juicy, tender and flavorful. I thoroughly enjoyed this place and highly recommend it. :) Would love to go back again.",

However, the service for the Hibachi grill was a little slow because they couldn't get our grill to heat up. We were sitting there for a good 20 mins before our server explained to us what was going on. Luckily...the food made up for the delay and I will definitely come back to give them another try.",

Waiter was very attentive, immediately taking drink, then food orders. Soup and salad came out quickly. Small wait for the hibachi chef, but not too bad. He was very entertaining and I really enjoyed watching the show. I ordered the pick 3 special, got New York Steak, Shrimp and Salmon. It was all fabulous!!! Husband got Sukiaki Beef and really enjoyed it as well. It's not a cheap dinner, but a great value for all the food you get. We will definitely be back!",

The sushi rolls were very bland, and the pieces were very small,especially for the price.  The fried oysters were basic and the batter is standard, not different that stands out.  Spicy beef did not have spice but did have some flavor, asked the server if it had green peppers and he did not seem to understand due to language barrier, but I'm not a fan of green peppers.  Overall food was bland, atmosphere and service is nice.  Better sushi joints out there",

I wanted to order dessert but was kind of taken aback of how quickly they wanted us to leave.

Before tonight this was just a safe place to try decent Japanese near our home. Having the teppanyaki was the best decision! The cook also puts on a show, like the flaming onion ring volcano plus he launches shrimp from the grill into the patrons mouths. Now on to the food... we got the sukiyaki beef and NY steak (both prepared medium) as well as scallops, shrimp and salmon. For group of five, we just got 2 orders each of the above to share and it proved plenty. Totally loved everything we were served! I finished it all but the rest of the family had to get take out boxes. Also included were a cup of onion soup, salad with ginger dressing and grilled vegetables, which was also pretty good. The service is excellent! We'll definitely be back.",

    "text": "By the far the cheapest tappenyaki/hibachi around town. You can seriously get by dinner here for $15 while other places charge $50-80 per plate. Ridiculous!! I was really surprised when I saw the menu on how cheap it was. Especially with the great quality of the food here.  I can only rate on the hibachi section (where they cook your food in front of you) since that's the only part I've experienced. You first start out with a small soup and salad. Veggies are already included in your cooked meal. You choose between fried rice and fried noodle (basically chow mein). Then you pick your meat. They have a pretty good range including chicken, NY steam, filet minion, shrimp, calamari, kobe, etc. They really slab a lot of the food with butter, but I assume that's why it all taste so good.  Chefs are very entertaining. They do all sorts of tricks with their knives and try to entertain you with the food.   The only reason why I am taking off one star is because I encountered 1 chef that was a bit rude. Usually when I come here, all the chefs are pleasant and funny. Recently when I came, the chef asked how I like my steak cooked. So I said \"well done.\" He gave me a nasty look and said \"really? Why bother get filet minion then?\" It caught me off guard as he came off like that. In my head, I thought why does it matter? He should of just cooked it the way I requested. I felt like he was complaining because he was impatient and didn't wanna keep standing there just to cook mine. It shouldn't matter how one likes their steak...just cook it. I wanted to complain to the manager, but I didn't wanna make that big of a deal of it.   So I'm sorry if you encounter a douchebag chef, but most of them are really nice. Just hope it doesn't offset or ruin your night.   Praying that y'all get a decent chef next time. ~",

    "text": "Today is the first time I've been Ohjah and I'll visit here second time. Ohjah is a Japanese restaurant with Hibachi. I go to the one located in the crossing of Decatur Blvd and Blue Diamond Rd. It is hard to find a proper parking lot in dinner time. The restaurant is separated as two parts. One is sushi bar and tables, the other one is Hibachi. Hibachi is so popular that we have to wait for 1 hour to came in. There are 3 big tables that can sit around 60 people. Light is comfortable, Aroma smell good, no music here. The noise is very loud because two many people sitting together and some parties also make noise. Server busser and cooks wear nice uniform. Service is good but I see sometimes elderly has difficulty talking with server, a young Asian lady.  I observed that she tries her best serve all customers but there are too many people eating here and she is the only server in hibachi room. Sometimes the refill beverage is not in time. I think two servers may be better at the dinner time. Food is excellent and affordable. The combination of Ohjah with 7 course is only 32 dollars. The cooking in front of you is also a show that you can enjoy it. Cooks will clean the iron plate very well after finishing cooking. Overall the experience with Hibachi make me feel very good and I definitely will come back.",

It was so nice because the Hibachi is not only delicious but the prices are really reasonable. They are also very accommodating because one of my friends brought me a cake and they were nice enough to keep it in their fridge till after our meal. When our meal was finished the waiter cut the cake and served it. They were busy that night but they didn't rush us out. The service and food is excellent! I can't wait till they open the one on Hualapai and Flamingo!",

Our chef wasn't as animated as some of my previous hibachi experiences but he was on point. The lobster was very good and the filet was perfectly cooked and very tasty. One of my kids decided against hibachi and there was plenty on the menu for her to choose. I would recommend them and will return.",

We opted for the hibachi/teppanyaki and were seated promptly, drinks served, orders taken and ready to dine and be entertained by our teppan chef. Our chef was engaging and entertaining. Sitting with two locals who frequented the place further bolstered our confidence that we made the right choice for dinner...well, they were pretty drunk with multiple sake bombs by the time they started eating so maybe anything will taste good after that. Food turned out to be good and my steak was tender and yummy. Pleasantly surprised by the quality and flavor of the food...it wasn't too salty as is the case with most teppan style cooking. A good find!  I guess drunkenness doesn't really dull one's taste buds after all.",

I actually would rate this as a great place to bring someone on a first date! The lights are dimmed at the restaurant area and the hibachi side was full of energy. They serve sushi and other Asian dishes.   The hibachi is my favorite area.  What's good about it is that you can still order from items from the menu. The chefs are very entertaining.  They joke around with your table and do all the fancy tricks such as making the volcano onion, making the shrimp bunny, etc.    The food is cooked exactly the way your ordered it.  It's very tasteful and the sauce they provide work perfectly with the items you order (fish vs meat vs chicken).    Don't forget to check in because you get a free small sake bottle which was awesome!   The price is very decent compared to other places such as Benihana.  It's about 40% less than the other hibachi restaurants.    I ordered there house combo which was to pick any 3 items for your dish.  It was a surprise that the filet mignon was able to be part of your 3 items.    The staff are super friendly and never has disappointed me.  I've been going at least 1 once month to treat myself and family.  This place is awesome! Stop reading and just go and experience it for yourself!!!",

    "text": "It is really hard to rate this place. But In a good way! I have one reference spot for Japanese food in the world it is in Amsterdam (Sapporo - <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz/sapporo-amsterdam?uid=87YceO0nqfZLOUeGg_aEOQ&utm_campaign=www_business_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)\">yelp.com/biz/sapporo-ams...</a> ).  But Ohjah is coming pretty close to it, so it is hard for me to rate cause they doing one of the best jobs I ever had in America, but they are still a bit below Sapporo. So would I compare this place 1:1 against Sapporo it would get famous four stars.   But since it is the best place I found so far in the USA for getting authentic (and not only show related) experience for Japanese food Ill give it a well-earned five-star rating.  Food ist fresh, seasoned enough to let the foods own taste shine through.  But as well important as that is, they bring the food on the plate when it is at a perfect temperature. Chicken should just be not rare any longer, a scallop has to leave the tepanyaki plate at the right moment, a second later it can be too late.  Of course, it is a kind of a gamble, since those hugee places have a lot of chefs and not everyone is perfectly trained or even done with the training.   We had luck both times we went and get always chefs that know the products and prepared them perfectly.   If you are into Japanese Food and that does not mean sushi then this is the place to go in Vegas and we will be back for sure to enjoy more! Since Amsterdam is to far away for a short trip :) ",

My friend shared her crunchy shrimp roll called rock n roll, and I just picked out the shrimp. The waitress we had was very nice without overly checking on our table.

We started with appetizers chicken egg rolls, and tempura calamari.  Both were light, flakey, and freshly made.  Give it a couple minutes to cool down because it's that fresh.    My main entree was a side of steam rice, and sashimi chief's choice (5 assorted).  The Chef's  choice was Albacore Tuna, Salmon, Tuna, Yellow tail, and Sea bass was all refreshingly delicious.  The assortments vary everyday, so get your sashimi  adventure taste buds on.    Finally, I order their Green Tea Tempura ice cream enough to share between four people.  The deep fried tempura was excellent.  No too crispy, and not too doughy.  I can not wait to come back, and try their hibachi side.  From what I can tell the hibachi section is great, for couples, or a large group.  I am definitely looking forward to watching the chefs cook my food in front of me with their unique entertaining style.  Dine in section is recommend, for a nice conversation, and a more intimate experience.  Rated based on atmosphere, cleanliness, presentation, taste, and overall satisfaction.",

I had some friends from the east coast come out to Las Vegas to celebrate a birthday and in the midst of planning everything else I suggested this place because she loves the whole Hibachi teppanyaki thing. Now normally people are quick to turn to Benihana's when they think Hibachi however I just prefer to think outside of the box and not run to what everybody else likes. They are a bit overrated in my opinion but that's neither here nor there. Back to Ohjah..  Reservations were easy as pie to make and the young lady who assisted with the request was very pleasant to work with. We informed them ahead of time that this party of 7 would be celebrating a special occasion which was for the birthday girl! We were a bit late and called them to let them know and still are reservation was held and we began the festivities of what Ohjah has to offer. I really love that they keep things super traditional and at the bar they offer only whatever special drinks they concoct, sake hot/cold and wines both red and white!  Our chef was pretty damn awesome with plenty energy he performed many tricks to impress. The chefs attitude usually can make or break your whole experience at these type of restaurants so it's imperative that you luck up on getting one who truly enjoys the job.  The fact that they went above and beyond to make sure my friends birthday dinner was perfect was absolutely appreciated! The food here was great and I personally enjoyed my Shrimp and fried rice! I will be returning soon!",

We ordered the hibachi combination which allows you to pick three choices of protein which we picked New York steak, shrimp, and scallop. All of this was $31. Which was a great deal. We also ordered a sushi roll. It was love something roll we asked the server for recommend and she recommended that roll and it was really good and refreshing. The scallop for the hibachi was nice big and juicy. It wasn't cheap and small which was awesome! The steak was delicious and good quality and the fried rice was cooked perfectly with enough flavor. The onions in the veggies was very delicious too. Seriously loved everything about this place. Great service too. It's affordable hibachi here and the quality of the food was very good.",

    "text": "My wife and I absolutely love this place!  The hibachi is one of the best in Vegas and the prices are so affordable for the quality of food you receive. From the delicious soup and unique but delicious salad to incredible cuts of meat this place  rocks! Good luck finding a better filet mignon for anywhere near the price. The sushi has got to be my favorite that I've had. It is quite a bit more expensive than some of the more mainstream sushi spots, but too compare them to places like sushi mon would be an insult. They use super fresh cuts of fish and not even the seaweed has that nasty typical sushi flavor. It's really a demonstration on how sushi SHOULD be done. Another thing to keep in mind is the fact you are getting more than food at this hibachi and the show is always amazing no matter which chef you get. Some are funnier than others, but I enjoy getting a different routine every now and then. If you choose to eat the hibachi I strongly encourage to buy a round of sake bombs! It's a blast for you and your friends and surprisingly smooth. I eat here whenever I have an opportunity and it comes highly recommended. I'm currently trying to convince myself to spend the money and get the Kobe beef! Looks delicious!",

    "text": "If you enjoy tepan grills this place is worth checking out. Food is always delicious and servers always entertain, regardless of age. Their sushi is fresh and tasty. There are certain rolls I love (like the Blue Diamond Roll, YUM!) and others I'm not particularly a fan of, but that's more a matter of taste rather than quality. The tepanyaki is delicious. I've had the chicken, steak, and shrimp with fried rice --- SO GOOD! I also appreciate that when I come here with a group of friends or just my boyfriend they'll allow me to sit at the grill if I only wish to order sushi. Granted, most of my visits have been during their slower times but I still very much appreciate that they offer it. My only complaint is that every time I visit, slow or busy, I have a very difficult time getting a second refill from my server. This only really bothers me because I can be with one or two others who get three or four refills and I will have to flag them down to ask for one. Nonetheless I always come back because their prices are really competitive and the food is phenomenal.",

They didnt know it was my birthday until the guest on the side of us asked if it was my birthday and then my waiter heard about it and asked me if it was bday?  Next thing you know, the lights dimmed and flickered and a birthday song came on and they also sang Happy Birthday!  The food, the service and the atmosphere is absolutely amazing!

I have been there twice now and plan to make it one of my regular spots to eat. Both my dinners were just wonderful and the staff are top notch and have a way of making you feel at home. just a wonderful place to dine.

My boyfriend had the fried rice and I had the fried noodle (chow mein).  I would just like to say it was so delicious and melts on your mouth!  We loved our chef and our food, but whilst eating dinner a check gets dropped off then 5 minutes later the manager checked if we paid.   Although I understand that maybe as hibachi tables stand, there's another group of people coming in, we still felt rushed and needed to get out. We were there to celebrate and to drink with really great food, but we were cut short. I hate feeling like we're being rushed out, especially when dessert wasn't offered. Because we felt like we needed to clear out, we didn't even get to look at the dessert menu again, and I wanted dessert! I mean, we were celebrating. We would've ordered another round of drinks with dessert, but wasn't given the chance and that is the only complaint.",

Went in for late lunch with the gf.  Mistaken impression that hibachi meant it was bbq'ing meats on a lil hibachi either self serve or cooked to order.  Told it was basically teppan style AND not available until evening.   Not happy.  Went ahead and ordered some sushi, soup and a few other unremarkable items.  Nothing stood out for either of us.

(I think it was too drowned in sauce). The salad was ok, I prefer a ginger dressing that tastes like ginger. The service was good, the prices are good too.

The kushi took about 45 minutes, and the yakisoba over an hour. The rolls were good and so was the kushi, but unfortunately when the yakisoba finally came, I couldn't eat it, it came with the paper from a straw in it. Had it come from my straw, I would've eaten it, but I was unsure where it came from, as it didn't come from our table.  We received a discount and the dish was removed from our check, but after an hour I was really looking forward to trying it. May not be returning.. As for the service, saw waiter a few times in the hour and 45 minutes we were there, but only received one update on the length of time for the yakisoba and kushi.",

The atmosphere is fun and exciting. The staff is extremely attentive and quick with any request. I would recommend this restaurant just for the service.   Now on to the food. All of us ordered the hibachi with the starter (soup and salad). It was delicious. The girls offered off the kids menu and we ordered off the adult menu. The portions and price are perfect for our family. Reasonable for the amount of fun that we had and the food was delicious.   The girls already asked to have their birthday celebration here. The staff does a little something special for the birthday boy or girl. We witnessed 4 birthdays during our dining experience. Fun times!",

There are better places that are further away. I have no complaints about the food or the service.  They've always treated us good.    The reason I gave it 3 stars is the method they use for sitting people. The place has never been slammed. There are always hibachi tables open.  For example tonight it is 6:03 and they have two entire hibachi tables open and one that is finished and paying for their food, yet they are not taking walk ins.  They will put you down for a reservation in 30 minute increments.  So they won't sit the open table for 27 more minutes.  So I told them we would wait for the 6:30 reservation and that is when they told us we were the 1st on the 6:30 reservation list.  Haha so they won't sit us at any of the open tables because they reserve them for reservations but there was no one on the reservation list for 6:30 until we made a reservation.   We'd come here allot more if they were better at seating people. It's a shame.",

Our party did the Teppan side and I ordered one roll but mostly teppan all night. So we were mostly taken care of by the teppan man. Before everything started, they served us with drinks salad and soup.  Salad was pretty good, but I don't recommend the soup... As we finished our cook came by and no introduction really. Just verified our orders and how we wanted it. It was a rough start with him.. but as time passed he started to open up and make the kids laugh.  As for the food, it was all good. The fried rice, fried vegetables, salmon, and steak. He made it right in front of us, how we like it and all, and overall we all enjoyed it.  There was a spill that happened at our table and the teppan man tried to wave down a server but no one came by till I was already finished cleaning up the mess for my niece. The lady who stopped by just stood there waiting for the teppan man to tell her, there's a spill. I had to point it out and even give her dishes that were stacking up at our table.  I get it, it's auto gratuity but I would've rather given that to the chef and the really nice guy who helped us whenever he had the chance.   Not a bad place, but not 100% wonderful.",

I feel that surrounding yourself with the people you know, it'll make the experience less awkward for you and the tapanaki chef.   I also suggest coming here when you have friends or family visiting. They'll love every part of it. Get the scallops with an extra squeeze of lemon, filet mignon medium rare, the fried noodles YUM, and ask about the dressing for the salad because it was really savory.   The pricing is reasonable. Don't forget to tip your chefs! The staff is also very friendly. You can reserve before hand! ;)",

Now that we've moved further away,  we only go on special occasions but definitely a must for my 11 year old on every birthday he has so far.  We actually prefer it here than Benihana; better customer service, food, and prices.  We normally opt for the hibachi side of the restaurant and we just add sushi once in awhile.  The Ono (super white tuna) is just melt in your mouth goodness.  Can't go wrong choosing either garlic noodles or fried rice or you can get both!

She never got irritated and just helped us.   The sushi quality was great. Presentation was great. But the best part was the taste, it was all super tasty and not 1 roll tasted the same. Oftentimes when I eat sushi, although it tastes pretty good, it generally all taste about the same and becomes this boring monotony. So I was pleasantly surprised to have such a good experience!",

Made reservations for 7:30 on a Sunday, just 45 minutes prior. All the traditional comedy, volcano, onion train and flipping shrimp into patrons mouth. Very filling, large amount of food.

He kept saying \"this is Ohjah I am the chef, eat your rice or else I take you home, you respect me\".  He kept saying this throughout the whole Hibachi presentation, no smiling, strictly stoic face. I mean cmon shes 5! Also, we felt rushed with service it was only 930pm closes at 11pm.  Overall, if you see a bald old asian man with a strong japanese accent who works there on a thursday night, leave and go home.  Bad service",

We were walk-ins and they sat us immediately, surprising since it was a Friday night around 7pm, seating us at a table with a party of three and a party of two. The food and service were excellent - I had the filet mignon (medium rare) and my hubby had the chicken - and our hibachi chef was absolutely hilarious! The prices were very fair and our server was attentive and friendly. The Long Island Ice Tea I ordered had wayyyy too much lemon juice, but I didn't complain or send it back, so I can't justify knocking off a star from the rating. We had a great time and this will definitely be our go-to hibatchi joint!",

Everything else was great as usual except the scallops. They were so gritty they were inedible. disappointing and made me wary that they are not washing their seafood properly.

I see some of the Chefs trying to put on a \"fun\" cooking expedition and a few others that have become very robotic.   The main reason I'm writing this review is because the manager, who has been there every time, NEVER smiles,  NEVER says thank, NEVER checks on our table and NEVER does ANYTHING to try to earn future business.  He has seen our family on MANY occasions as we our usually 6-8 guests at a time and is simply RUDE! There's so many other Japanese Steak houses to get great food in Vegas.  I think it's time we take our business elsewhere to feel appreciated for supporting a local restaurant instead of going to the hotel resorts. Very Frustrated!",

They offer sushi at the sushi bar or anywhere in the restaurant and I find it to be of great value and excellent quality.  The rolls are large and filling, definitely worth grabbing if you stop in.  I also recommend the teppanyaki style dining, it is extremely affordable and is of much better quality and appeal than any of the large competitors like Benihana's or other teppan style restaurants in town. If you want to avoid the teppan, you can just grab an entree off the regular menu. We have tried many of the different options and all of them are greatly priced and extremely filling. Many times me and my wife will just split an entree and some rolls and leave their over filled with left overs. If you're ever looking for some good Japanese, I highly recommend it.",

Many friends like Hibachi but they dont like the smell their clothes take on. Overall, the service was very on point, prices were very reasonable, food quality was very good. The filet I had was good, but not the highest quality. The chef cooking was alot of fun. Had a few new tricks I haven't seen. Another must visit destination.",

    "text": "Just finished our dinner here and made this one of faves for taking out of town friends and family to.  We were warmly greeted by the host and seated immediately in the teppan grill room, which appears to seat about 60-70 at six different stations.  They call it a \"hibachi\" dinner.   If anyone has ever eaten at Benihana's or the Nijo Castle (Newark, CA), I recall paying about $25-30 per Teppan entree.  Here, you pay $8.95 for the Hibachi basics: soup, salad, rice (steamed or fried) or fried noodles.  Then you choose your add ons or what they call \"mix or match\" which is your proteins.  Chicken teriyaki is $4.95, NY steak is $5.95, filet mignon is $7.55, shrimp $5.75 and so on,  There is also salmon, $5.75 scallops ($7.55),  Lobster tail (6 oz.) for $15.95, Kobe beef $48.95.  They also offer 3 basic entree items (not included is the lobster tail, Kobe beef or Halibut) + the Hibachi basics for $28.95.   I ordered the scallops and chicken, the wife, steak and it is still cheaper than other similar restaurants.  The quality of the food is good. Portions were decent.  The soup was mild in flavor, the salad though was disappointing. The dressing was watery and you could tell the salads were pre-made earlier in the day.   Pre-tip for our family of four with 2 kid's hibachi entrees (steak & chicken) with sodas and  a large Sapporo was $76.  They do offer lunch. sushi, sashimi, nigiri, and a good selection of Japanese entrees in their regular dining room, which has a sushi bar.  We're hoping this restaurant stands the test of time and continues to flourish at its location since there is no other restaurant like this in the SW part of town,  They also have a location in Pahrump.",

First of we opted for the Hibachi and I am so glad we did! My fiance loves sashimi so he ordered the blue fin tuna, I do not really care for the raw stuff only in Miami and LA did I actually enjoy it!! Well I am addicted, that blue fin tuna was so so yummy. He ended up ordering another. For six dollars you get two healthy servings and it melted in my mouth with deliciousness! I am sold that is something  that  I will order again and again! My fiance got the trio Hibachi he chose the filet, the scallops and sole!! I ordered the lobster tail. The star for both of us was the sole! It was all delicious but we are still dreaming about that sole!! The filet was yummy and so were the scallops and the lobster but that sole was so memorable and unexpected because I love lobster but the sole was so freaking amazing! By the way my fiance thought the lobster was awesome, too! I was not in the mood for sake bombs but my girlfriend that was with us never had one so we decided to get some beer and sake to have sake bombs but the Hibachi chef told us they offer  sake bomb individually which is perfect! Well after the first round we got about 4 more rounds! It was so entertaining the way they do it! We had a blast! The noodles, the soup, the rice, the veggies all so delicious and tasty I had to control myself. Jack was our Hibachi chef and was awesome!! They made us feel so welcomed. My fiance can chug like no other so they kept giving bigger glasses of beer to try to beat him in the sake bomb challenge, they failed!! Super super night definitely be back again and again! I have already recommended this place to so many! I am so glad to have this place so close to my home Southern Highlands. We like to stay close and anything like that is xtreme sushi! We never feel comfortable and welcomed there and they have some good but a lot mediocre. So this will be our regular spot hope they stay because they are so great and in this economy where people are usually staying home it helps if you treat people right, plus I'd be heart broken if the service was bad because the food was so outstanding!! The whole combo works hope they keep it up and last!",

Overall, rolls were decent. Decor is very zen, and a lot bigger than most sushi restaurants located in this part of town. You also have the option to do hibachi, which we still ave yet to do.",

I had a fried sushi and it was not good. So, I cannot judge on it once I had only one kind of sushi, i wouldn't order any other sushi. But would go back 1000ish times just for the hibachi. I had salmon, my hubby had the steak+chic OMG so tasty!!!",

I wanted to make sure I wrote a review because it's somewhat off the beaten path in a small \"strip mall\" area next to a liquor store. Place could be easily missed.   Tried several items on the menu (some lunch special). For 2 people, 2 apps., 2 miso soups, and 3 sushi orders - came to about $40 w/tax. For apps, had the chicken skewers. It wasn't that bad, but it was bland. I knew to stick to seafood.  The miso was good not too salty. The only roll I can recall the name of is the \"Valintine\" (sp?)  I'm not certain if it's because they're new, but having a website would be helpful, especially because they deliver. Overall, the place was clean, service was quick, and food was tasty.",

    "text": "Like most of the reviews, the Southern Highlands area really needed a good Japanese restaurant as the area is pretty barren for choice.  Luckily Ohjah opened up in the discreet and empty strip mall across from Albertsons.  The first thing I noticed while entering the place with my wife was the Chinese conversation going on between the hostess and a chef.  Being from Hong Kong, it was a bit of a downer considering we were aching for some quality Japanese food, and seeing the place was ran by Chinese, our expectations immediately dropped.       The decor inside is very nice, the lighting is very good, and the staff very polite.  We ordered two lunch sets, the steak teriyaki for myself, and the wife had a steak stir fry.  The waitress tried selling us sushi ( she counted six times throughout our lunch), which seemed ok if we were the least bit interested.  The salad was cold to the point of almost too cold to eat, they need to keep it out of the fridge before serving, but the dressing was decent and could have been worse.  The miso soup is mundane, which probably came in packages you could get at Albertsons or Whole Foods.  The steak teriyaki and stir fry were pretty good, although the tray they brought the food out with smelled of bleach...  Yeah  All in all, it's a decent place.  We just had too high of expectations, thinking a nice Japanese family was setting up shop, only to see frozen to fryer type food.  The real biter is the price, which makes sure we won't be visiting again.  I want to love this place, because it's so close and it's Japanese, however I can't.  I would say to try it though, it's something different in the Highlands area, and it's at least worth a shot.",

Next you add on your choice of meat, fish, shrimp, scallops or lobster - these prices vary from $4.95 - $49. I ordered the teriyaki steak and it was phenomenal! My friend ordered the New York steak and he thought it was amazing as well. We also ordered saki with our meal, 2 large Saporo's and for dessert mango mochi. It was a ton of food and drinks, and I think we spent about $80 with tip for the chef and waiter. Our chef was funny and entertaining. Great experience and we will definitely be going back!

Not sure where the issue lies with that one.  Still, they are apologetic through the waiting process, but it has happened more than once.  On the other hand, no complaints about dining in.",

I was surprised at how large the potion was and it came with scallops which was a pleasant surprise because I also love scallops. We ordered the golden gate roll which was also very tasty. From just those three items I was so full we had to take home leftovers! I would recommend this place to anyone who is craving sushi and would like high quality food without spending a lot of money.

It's a platter (shaped like a ship) with all sorts of nom-nom-nom nigiri, sashimi, and your choice of three specialty rolls.  So, so good.  This is a shared plate, and you need at least two people (who are especially hungry) or, more wisely, four people.    I am a fan of the caterpillar roll, so inevitably this was one of my choices.  Tender eel, firm avocado, nicely packed rice, and tasty sauce - nom.    The service here was great too!  The server was a pleasant woman who was always ready with water refills (why ruin the tastiness of sushi with a competing flavor from soda?), and the sushi chef was ready to answer questions.

We have to go back and try the standard menu.  The chefs are funny and engaging! Catch a shrimp in your mouth flipped with the spatula right off the grill! I was the only one on our table to try, everyone else just had it flipped on their plate; When in Rome! err Japan?  As part of the Hibachi grill menu you get:  1. Onion soup (nice little starter with light onion flavor).  2. Salad with ginger dressing (warning: they drown the salad in dressing, so maybe ask for it on the side; but I love the dressing so no complaints here) 3. Sauteed veggies. 4. Fried rice or noodles. 5. Your choice of protein. I recommend to spend a little extra and getting the Filet  over  the other steak cuts.  Even though I ordered my NY strip medium, because it was then sliced before plating it kept cooking more and came closer to well done.  The Filet was more tender and ordered medium-rare came to your plate closer to medium but Delicious! I enjoy a good surf & Turf so I also had the calamari which was just ok, Someone in our table ordered lobster and scallops.  The scallops looked amazing so I will try that next time, Lobster looked a little small but what can you expect from a Hibachi grill.  The rice was flavorful and the veggies were delicious, I love me some mushrooms.  (why was the mushroom invited to the party? Cause he was a Fun-gi!).    We definitely will return. The bill ran about $40-$50 for two. Not bad for a date night (don't worry, it was an impromptu date night, I'm no cheap date giver). The sig-other definitely enjoyed the experience and the food.  Did i like it? Oh-jah (oh-yea) I definitely did.  Horrible attempt of a pun. Sorry.",

    "text": "Goodness. I never wanted to be that person that sits and complains about a place but I am feeling almost despondent about what happened to my family tonight at this Decatur location.  It was my little boys 13th birthday celebration and his father was there with his girlfriend and family and I was on my way to meet them for a 7pm reservation when his father texted me at 7:03 (I was six minutes late) and said \"What do you want to eat? They are pressuring us to order NOW. I said \"Can you please ask them to wait, I will be there by 7:06, I am 1 mile away\" and both my son and his father were texting me back and saying, \"they are being really aggressive about making us order now so we will just order for you.\"   When I got there and sat down, our cook then showed up with the food prep. Me being the kind of girl that always loves to engage with people, especially in customer service/interactive places like this, grinned at him and said \"Yahhh.. Are you going to do some Magic for us tonight?\" and then looked at my son to see him smile back.      The chef BARKED back at me with a scowl on his face saying \" I DON'T DO MAGIC, if you want to see a MAGIC SHOW you go to the MGM GRAND! I cook!\". Then he continued to go on and say a few more choice things. At this point I am flat out humiliated and said jokingly \"Well I am sorry, I didn't realize it was such an insult to ask you if you were going to perform some magic for us\".         There was NO SMILE on this man's face and no one at our table was smiling when he said these things.     He made me very uncomfortable the entire dinner and that In turn made my poor son uncomfortable.  Twice he slammed down his spatula ( part of the schtick I get it) but it kept scaring me and I would let out a little shriek and laugh and he would just scowl every time it happened.     Just a miserable experience. He was extra loud, aggressive and just so much negative energy.  Never smiled once.   Then they brought out the wrong cake for my son.   We had to remind them and so they brought out the one that we had bought and they sang Happy Birthday to him again, for the second time in a row. I joked to my son that he just aged a year in 5 minutes.   We had no sooner taken two bites of our cake when they started bringing out new plates and silverware trying to rush us out of there.  It was apparent they wanted to turn the table over and we felt very unwelcome so we rushed to leave.     I would not recommend this place to ANYONE.. EVER.   It's nothing but trying to get as many people in and out of there as quick as possible and they have NO respect for the fact that the customers may want to take a little time to enjoy the hundreds of dollars they just spent.    I am finding out the name of our COOK and calling to complain to the manager tomorrow. I am sorry but no one deserves to be treated with disrespect when they are spending their hard earned money in their establishment.",

Nothing great, and very greasy. The kids love the hibachi experience though, so we've gone for a couple of special occasions, because it's a bit pricy for what you get.  Christmas night, we finished family get togethers early, and thought it would be nice to grab a bite to eat. The places that were open were packed, so we eventually found ourselves here. We ate in the regular dining room. I ordered the salmon teriyaki. It was horrible. It tasted very fishy, and was so over cooked, that it was actually a challenge to chew.  Needless to say, I didn't eat it all.  Four hours later, I barely made it to the bathroom, and basically stayed there for the next two days. I was SO sick. My friend who is an ICU nurse had to come over and give me Zofran... This is the only thing that kept me out of the hospital, as I literally could not keep anything in me for a little over 48 hours. Merry Christmas to me! UGH.  Do NOT trust the food here. There's no need to pay for overpriced food, that can possibly send you to the hospital.",

This place is just as good or better than the other expensive Japanese Steakhouse restaurants but Ohjah is a much better value. We will be coming back here for sure. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a nice restaurant.  The menu has many tempting choices for you to choose from. We had the Hibachi dinner with New York steak, lobster tail, shrimp, and chicken. They were all perfectly cooked and delicious.  Next time i plan to try the sushi too.   Also, we met some very nice people at our table which made the experience even better.",

I went here back in February for my birthday and the portions are excellent and the chef did his normal routine of crazy knife flipping, shrimp tossing and creating volcanoes out of a stack of onions and oil.   I also like the regular restaurant area because the regular rolls are decent. the sesame dressing in their house salad in phenomenal (a small detail I look for in Japanese/hibachi restaurants), the baked mussels are tasty and I loved the size of the glass when I ordered an oyster shooter. Surprisingly I also liked the portion of the pad Thai they serve here (yes, they have Thai on the menu at this place). I don't believe they do AYCE but it's still not a bad establishment to go to once every other month.",

I watched this place being built and couldn't wait for the day the doors were open.  My wife and I finally went here for dinner when we had a visitor from Cali.  I would like to think of myself as a sushi purist and typically I don't consider eating hibachi.  Call me stuck up but, I always felt that hibachi was a bit \"touristy\" and more like Japanese for the \"newbie\".    Anyhow, this visit made me cheat on my first love, sushi.  I loved this place and the prices were super competitive.  We started with sake bombs that were only $2, cheap!  I got the strip steak dinner and it was only about $15 - $16.  The steak and fried rice were delicious.  That week we actually went there 3 times!    The staff is super friendly.  Every time we went the chef's were always personable and a little sarcastic, in a good way.  We actually found out that Ohjah means, King of the Ninjas.  Cool!  Also, if you just want to try out there menu a good time to go is during lunch cause the prices are a bit lower.  I would go again and I do recommend going as a group for the hibachi dinner.",

So far, the 1st impression that it gave me was expensive dinning,but after my dinning experience I realized that I was totally wrong.  It was by for the best Dianne I EVEN HAD.very reasonable price for an excellent quality of food and service. I think that's why the parking lot is always packed~!!! I'd recommend make reservation B4 you come spcielly on weekends(sushi chef told me) I set at the bar coz the hibachi was full~(it was an hour wait time on that side) we tried the sushi.The fish was super fresh ,Chef was friendly and funny at some point.If they have a little of time they even make some special dishes not listed on the menu and I got the wahoo, so yum~!! The manager was keep asking us how's everything and told us about hibachi,such a nice and funny guy~ I'm coming back next time to try the hibachi table,seems that is really <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fgood.no&s=ab99f2aa4ffa0de2bd9a11a53edf12c5b45d5a277f3c9f1223dc276662951d6a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">good.no</a> regrets, I had a wonderful sushi and enforgettable dinning experience!!!!",

We saw this place when we would eat at Cafe Rio which was across the street.    The servers were nice.  The menu had a lot of selections.  They also served Chinese and Thai food.  Both times I have been there it was for sushi and not the hibachi, so I can't speak for that.  Thinking back, I can't even remember the name of the roll I tried and remembered if it was good.  Which goes to show it was probably just alright.  The restaurant is nice; and it is dark inside.  The funny thing, I do remember is that every time they brought out a dessert for a guest's birthday, the old school 'happy birthday' song (kids singing) would go on their sound system, haha",

    "text": "Weeks of enduring the heavenly aromas of teriyaki goodness sizzling away on hearty grills, wafting across the road every time I drove by this restaurant, are what brought me to Ohjah.  As the restaurant was being built, and when it finally opened, I remember thinking (with a raised eyebrow), \"Another restaurant in a strip mall... hmm.\"  I'm very glad for the overly enticing smells coming from this place, otherwise, I may not have found one of my new favorite restaurants, and a True hidden gem.  Let me just say, right off the bat, that a prerequisite for working at this restaurant is to be one of the most genuinely nice and polite people on the face of the earth; I have never seen such friendly service... EVER.  We are greeted promptly and warmly every time we dine here.  The servers are always very attentive, and extra dishes are removed right away.  The restaurant is divided into two sections: the hibachi grill side, and the regular restaurant side (which includes a large sushi bar, booths, and tables).  Although I have only ever eaten on the regular restaurant side, I must say I will definitely try the hibachi side one day because of the sounds, smells, and action coming from that room are incredible!   The food is also incredible.  Some of the items we have had are: teriyaki scallops, tempura (vegetables and shrimp), numerous sushi rolls (the Black Widow is amazing!), nigiri, sashimi, miso soup, and the house salad.  All were equally delicious (and I'm finding myself strangely addicted to the house salad dressing -- it is mayo based and surprisingly light).  I did find the teriyaki scallops to have a bit too much of the \"char\" bits on them, but other than that, they were cooked perfectly, and the sauce complimented the flavor of the scallops very well.  The food is always fresh and delivered in a timely manner, and the plating is intricate, balanced, and inviting.  The prices are affordably appropriate as well.  I read in another review that this restaurant would be a great \"first date\" place to go, and I wholeheartedly agree (for the hibachi or the regular restaurant side).  The ambiance is very pleasant with simple and beautiful artwork on the walls, and low lighting, giving it a romantic feel.  At the same time, it is definitely a very family-friendly restaurant, and a great place to come with friends (especially with $2.50 sake bombs!).  Definitely give this restaurant a try when in Vegas, you won't be disappointed.  And if you live here in Vegas, and don't live close to this particular location, there are a few other locations in town (I have been to the Flamingo location recently, and if I were to review it, I would literally copy and paste this review in for that one as well).",

The staff was all very friendly and accommodating as well.   We made it in time to enjoy their lunch box specials, which were smaller and cheaper versions of their dinner boxes. I got the chicken katsu box while my husband got the beef teriyaki box. I couldn't believe the size of the boxes when they were brought to our table! Not only was my portion of the chicken katsu huge, but it also came with miso soup, salad, pork dumplings, and three California rolls (perfect because I am pregnant and can't have traditional sushi). The food was great and very filling!   I felt the prices were fair for what we ordered and even looking at the menu, the sushi prices I felt were reasonable as well.   We'll definitely be visiting Oojah again and I can't wait until I am able to try out their sushi!",

A little something for both genders.        - Owners - First Japanese restaurant that I've been to that had Chinese music playing. You usually see them owned by Japanese or Korean in Vegas.         - Soup - They said the soup was onion soup, but I'm pretty sure it was winter melon. It's a pretty traditional Chinese soup. They said they also had miso. **Ordered**        - $12.50 Unagi Don - A decent sized piece of eel as far as eels go. A tad dry, but not bad. It comes with soup and salad. Good for those who don't want a big meal.        - $14.95 New York Steak Teriyaki - A fairly large steak cooked to your liking covered in teriyaki sauce. It also came with a crab rangoon, salad, and a soup. Definitely worth trying if you like steak teriyaki (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sYfHxCqHpIX2HnDhw0JRAA?select=KW4CtKWK4DPBM0uOuXgjFQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/sYfH...</a>). **Recommendations**        - I'd recommend this place if you live near Blue Diamond. It's a nice place to eat without having to drive too far.",

The spider roll had crab meat in it and of course that paired perfectly with the soft shelled crab, but I've never had it prepared that way.  The highlight was a sushi rolled called \"Captain\" that was one of the more delightful rolls I've ever had. It had crispy fried onion rings on top of spicy tuna and some kind of garlic sauce. Serious yum and kudos to the sushi chef who came up with the idea!  I will definitely be back.  Thanks, Ohjah!",

They also say thank you when they bring your food, refill your drink, bring the check, etc.  The food itself was okay.  The salad dressing was refreshing, and the soup was flavorful.  I really liked the \"nachos\", which were two deep-fried wonton wrappers with imitation crab and avocado on top.   The cucumber salad was too salty,  the fried calamari was bland and the sauce it came with tasted like it was watered down.  The sukiyaki was good, but a little too sweet.  I ended up using the cucumbers as a condiment and put slices on top of everything to balance out the flavors.",

Along with outstandingly fresh sushi, authentic yakisoba, perfect vegetable tempura, and melt-in-your-mouth mochi, the service there was the absolute best I've ever experienced. I don't write many reviews but felt this place needed my mentioning.   Normally I research my restaurant options but yesterday we were starving and happened on this place so decided to chance it.   As soon as we walked in the door the staff rushed to greet us and then got down on the kids level and talked to them for a minute. Awesome! They were also very helpful and patient with our many questions about menu items and didn't seem irritated by our indecisivness.   We made our order and our rainbow roll was on the table within, not kidding, 3 minutes and was so SO fresh. As each dish was brought out and tasted, I was increasingly impressed. I wayyy overdid it on eating but the food was so worth it. The staff was very attentive and observant and when one of my girls started crying, they brought her over a small candy and talked to her.   They were very polite and rushed to the door to bid us goodbye as well.   We will be back for sure.",

Their menu is really large so you're bound to find something you like.  I, myself like their sushi combos because you can choose 2-4 rolls from the menu (a deal on it's own), plus you get some pieces of nigiri sushi and some selected sashimi.  The price is decent also!  However if you do order one of these sushi combo platters and also plan to eat regular food off the menu (that's lots of food by the way), you should probably put in your sushi order first because they do tend to take a little longer to make these combos for some reason. I never tried the hibachi, but there's always lots of people in there so I assume it's pretty good.    All-in-all, this is a good neighborhood family restaurant and it's worth a try.",

When I showed her my YELP check in, I think she got just as excited as I was. With the press of a button *poof* just like that free hot saki.   The chefs are great here. They are not just entertaining but they have a certain swagger when rocking those knives and spices. The entertainment factor alone made the night cool. The food was super good. All of the other reviews are 100% accurate. Everything just melts in your mouth. I was a little hesitant about getting the shrimp because previous reviews said it tasted too fishy or something like that. Im not sure if they made some changes or what, but it tasted fine to me. The 5 star factor here are the employees. We went here to celebrate a birthday and they made it really special. It wasn't just about the song or the dessert. They made the entire experience memorable. Ohjah ill definitely be back.",

The grillmasters are entertaining as always (I still can never catch the shrimps in my mouth for the life of me) and the service hasn't disappointed yet.   I have tried the filet mignon, Sukiyaki beef, salmon teriyaki, and the scallops. The filet mignon is my absolute favorite, it MELTS in your mouth. Filet would definitely be my recommendation for first timers and meat lovers.  The portions are filling as with your main hibachi dish you also receive: onion soup (I request for miso soup instead), house salad, grilled veggies, and your choice of fried rice or noodles.  For those who live southwest or nearby, I definitely recommend trying out Ohjah if you're in the mood for hibachi!",

All the seats at all 6 hibachi stations were maxed out.  Really impressed with how fast we got in there.  Most places even with reservations you still have to wait a little.  All of us ordered the three choice option at the grill which was a lot of food for under $32.  I did shrimp, calamari, and chicken with noodles!  Oh wee it hit the spot!  The ambience is fairly quiet until the chefs do their thing to entertain then the sound level spikes up, but that's the whole experience it's part of the fun.  My kids (8, 6, 5) haven't had a hibachi experience since they were babies so they finally got to enjoy it.  I checked in and got a free Sake!  Thank you for a great Friday Night!",

The flavor of the food was average. The place is getting 4 stars from me because chef didn't seem to have the patience to entertain our toddler kids. Our only reason to eat at the place was so the kids can have a little fun. It looked to me like our chef would have spent more time if the guests were grown ups.

    "text": "There's a teppanyaki area and a regular dining area to eat sushi, Thai dishes, and other non-teppanyaki Japanese dinner entrees. I usually go to the teppanyaki side where you start with a basic hibachi entree which includes onion soup, house salad with ginger dressing, rice (brown, fried, or steamed) OR fried noodles, and veggies (carrots, onions, broccoli, and zucchini) for $8.95. The house salad with ginger dressing is good but the onion soup is a little bland and boring. Then you pick your choice of meat. I went with the NY steak (5 oz) for an additional $7.95. My steak was cooked perfectly. You also get two dipping sauces. The brown sauce is for the meat and the yellow sauce is for your vegetables. The prices are reasonable compared to overpriced Benihana.  No issues with service from the several times that I have went. I would only come here for the teppanyaki. I ordered the Ohjah Boat (rolls, sushi, and sashimi served on a wooden boat) on a previous visit. The sushi was meh and a bit on the warm side so I will just stick to the teppanyaki here. This is pretty much Benihana's but a lot cheaper where the chefs do their show with the flaming onion volcano, throw an egg in the chef's hat and split it with a spatula trick, & the chef throwing shrimp in your mouth act, etc. I'm not coordinated when it comes to that so I always decline politely. There are a lot of families with kids who like to come here so if you're one of those diners who hate kids, stay away or if you have kids, they would probably enjoy dinner with a show.",

Cooked exactly how I asked (medium rare) and seasoned tremendously. I am a True fan of the Ohjah experience.  For about $20 each you can really experience a hibachi themed meal here.",

The only drawback is that the main door to the men and women's restroom (not the door to the restroom itself) is located right next to one of the hibachi stations.  One other bit of information. When you the chef is cooking all the food, listen to what other people are requesting to be done to the food. For example, someone requested well seasoned food, but you don't want well seasoned. Make sure the chef understands that request of both of you.",

Tonight was my 50th birthday and we'd been telling our friends how much we love Ohjah so we went there.  This is now the second time I've taken visitors to Ohjah to be embarrassed not only for us, but their business.  Our cook \"Michael\" didn't talk to any of us or do ANYTHING regarding teppanyaki skills, he only did a choo choo whistle thing at a strange time.  When he got to the shrimp throwing part he was tossing shrimp a foot over our head or under so it was uncatchable, it was very uncomfortable quite honestly.  I know this seems silly, but when you're watching other cooks doing it correctly you feel jipped.  I'm very disappointed in Ohjah for even allowing this amateur to \"entertain\" and cook for our group.",

We asked them to turn down the air but it remained a steamy cesspool of sweat and spice throughout our meal. The server confused our drinks a few times, again no biggie. But the main course came out before my appetizer, and my spicy beef had two bones in it. Nothing like killing your appetite trying to bite into a crunchy bone. The food tasted decent, but nothing great. The combination of meh service, extreme heat, and bones just killed it for me. Might have just come on off night but this was massively disappointing for all the good reviews I've read.",

Now I know some of you might not find this too exciting but forget all that if you would to have a go to local habachi or sushi steak house here it is. I have to say this location didn't seem or look like it has a big enough space inside for this but it did. Located next to Lee's Liquor and Papa Murphy pizza it also doesn't look like there is much parking. But have no fear there is plenty on the side and in back.   Upon entering you will find yourself in the restaurant/sushi bar side. They have a completely separate room for habachi next door. Our service girl was nice and the chef was really entertaining, I was very stoke we got the guy we did because the cook before him didn't look like he wasn't having such a great night. We came here for my Birthday celebration and everyone got a mix plate and I ordered the Ohjah Boat with sashimi, special sushi rolls, nigiri and seaweed salad.  The lobster, filet and shrimp teppanyaki was cooked and seasoned so perfectly. Meat was tender...not dried and tough like (Benihana's) and the shrimp and lobsters had great texture as well not chewy or fishy. The fried rice was yummy very garlicy just how I like it. I also got the Sushi and Shashimi boat for myself. Which is pretty awesome and more then enough food! come with 3 specialty sushi rolls of your choice and 10 pcs of nigeri 6 pcs of shashimi and a side of seaweed salad. BOMB!  All in all I loved this place and will be back and how cool is getting your sushi served on a freaking Boat Man?!?!.....Super cool!",

    "text": "First time finally trying this place out and I regret not coming here sooner, I'm so impressed! We ordered Beef Negimaki for our appetizer which was incredibly tender and full of flavor. I would come back just for this alone. I ordered the hibachi noodles with Filet mignon, which I was please to surprised it included the hibachi veggies, and salad and soup. Soup was so-so but the salad... Wow so simple yet so wonderful, something about the dressing you can't find anywhere else. My steak was cooked medium TO PERFECTION! I've been to fine dining steak houses that weren't as good and tender as this! My husband orders the fried rice (which I kept steeling, the scallops, and the chicken. The chicken was probably my least favorite, flavorful but a tad over cooked... I'll stick to my filet mignon. Great place to bring out of town guests, This place is great for birthdays too. We will be back!",

They do all the standard hibachi tricks but also new ones every once in a while. Our last chef said he youtubes videos, so you know they take pride in their work. The restaurant food is also delicious, they serve sukiyaki which is hard to find & love their sushi rolls. Make a reservation for hibachi for sure bc it's always packed. The restaurant side mid week is fine for walk ins but make a reservation for weekends. I have a large family so I always call for a reservation even if we're already on our way to make things easier.",

LOL)  So, we drive my Ohjah literally every day and wanted to try it out. We were very pleasantly surprised. The service was very good and the young lady that helped us was great. Even the owner ( or just a very official looking gentleman) came by our table.   We didn't do the Teppan Yaki so we sat at a regular table. The atmosphere is very nice and the restaurant is very clean. We got some vegetarian sushi rolls ( avocado and Asparagus tempura) that my wife LOVED. I tried them and they were very good. I got a simple california Roll and it was great too. She got vegetarian Fried Rice that was very fresh tasting with crisp sauteed vegetables. It was great. I got the New York Steak Teriyaki. It was good. We even got dessert ( Mochi and tempura Ice Cream).  Its very nice to have a good dining establishment in the Neighborhood. We will frequent Ohjah often.",

The miso soup is good, and because I'm pregnant I haven't tried too much sushi. I did get a tempura shrimp roll once and was disappointed that the batter was soggy instead of crunchy. However, I recently had the shrimp tempura entree, and it was dynamite, so they clearly can make a mean tempura if they want. The tempura dipping sauce was a little bland. Many of their sushi specialty rolls tend to be on the hot side rather than sweet. I usually don't eat California rolls, but my husband did the other day, and it was the best CA roll I've ever had. It left me scratching my head wondering how a CA roll could be so good.  Their teriyaki is pretty good. Sometimes the chicken is dry, but the New York steak is consistently good, and tender for NY. They reportedly make their own teriyaki sauce, and do not use MSG, huge plus.  As for sides, their rice can be inconsistent, but their salads have good dressing and are pretty darn good for iceberg lettuce.  The service is decent, but there are some new servers who do things like put the food on the middle or end of the table instead of in front of the person who ordered it. Usually not a biggie, unless its hot soup they put in front of a young child...  That aside, it's one of our favorite \"regular\" places.",

Each was slammed with 10 lbs. of spicy mayo and sweet eel sauce over flavorless spicy tuna, shrimp tempura, avocado, and/or cream cheese. Maybe we ordered the wrong things, but the phrase, \"Which roll is this again?\" was spouted during the course of the meal.   If there was a shining light in the meal, it was my hot entree. I actually enjoyed my spicy chicken. They were generous with their meat, the veggies were cooked perfectly, and it came with soup and salad. However, they should omit spicy from the description. It was more sweet and salty. I asked for extra spice but instead got an extra layer of red sauce. Other parts of the meal included a well excuted tempura. In the end, they gave pre-packaged hand cloths to wipe away all the grime and residue of your greasy claws. They have a hibachi grill if you want entertainment and flames. The atmosphere evokes dark and romantic but the clienteles are big-ass families with waistlines that match.",

Service was a HUGE improvement from my last visit.    Only Downfalls:  - they charged us for an extra order of edamame - not going to complain over $3  - they charge $1 extra per roll to sub. soy paper  We will be back thanks to Saly & Peter to give the Hibachi room another shot as well.",

    "text": "Fresh sashimi clean presentations.   Came here with a $20 certificate so we decided to go big and order the boat. This was a pretty good deal as it included 3 specialty rolls, salmon, ahi tuna, and hamachi sashimi, seaweed salad, and three types tobico for only $45. Just the specialty rolls were $10 - $12 each so it was well worth it. We also ordered the lychee Saki, they had a few different kinds of flavored Saki which are good for those don't like the original flavor of Saki. We were told the boat would take about 15 min but they served us each an order of the house salad as we wait.   When the boat came out I was very impressed by the presentation. The specialty rolls were OK, but what put the boat over the top was the slices of sashimi. Each slice was about half and inch thick with about 3-4 slices each. The quality of the fish was superb and with each bite you certainly can taste the freshness. In my mind what differentiates a lot of these sushi restaurants is the quality and freshness of their fish. Ohjah certainly displays fresh quality ingredients.   I would love to come back and try their Hibachi. But would definitely come back for their sashimi.",

We get there and instantly seated. I been waiting to try the hibachi for 1st and 2nd time here and our timing was off, but this time we were in.  So we started with some sake, our salad and onion soup which are both very good! The salad is my favorite. I gave up rice for lent so fried noodles it is. The fried noodle was very good!  I got the combo with 3 choices. I got scallops, filet mignon, and shrimp. I got this the very first time we can here but no hibachi show, it was lunch time. Food was 5 stars on its own.   Next our show, I forgot his name we had a couple bottles of sake. I guess we were waiting for more people for our table and they were very late and gave us complimentary edamame on the house while we waited. Very nice of them. Our show was the very fun! We all caught shrimp in our mouth. We had a blast, the price was right. Great food, service, fun. We will back soon, thank you Ohjah.",
