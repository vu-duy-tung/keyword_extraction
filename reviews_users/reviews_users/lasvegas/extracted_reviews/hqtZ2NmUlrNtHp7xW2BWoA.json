We'll be back to try more stuff.",

They were busy, so that alone told me it should be good.  We waited for our order, it didn't seem like a very long wait at all, when the owner, Kim came out to apologize because apparently our order slip fell and no one saw it til the owner picked it up.  Anyway, Kim comp our meal AND gave us a coupon towards our next visit.  The food is amazing!!! Thank you Kim! You are a very generous owner.  Your staff is very friendly, and well, once again.....your food is AMAZING!!! We will definitely be back!!!",

    "text": "Out with my kids and decided to get some late breakfast this morning. I've seen Waffles Cafe before and been curious about the food/concept. Our experience was pretty mixed. Cons: menu is confusing and \"building your own combo\" takes a hot minute to figure out. Are we in a Boba place or a milkshake place or a Waffle place? Are we better at breakfast or lunch? Slightly confusing.  Bathroom is dingy, maybe just unkept?, and waffle wasn't hot when served (butter-didn't-melt unhot). Brand feels a little confused somewhere between fast food and mom and pop diner. Fancy waffle around $7-$9 (for just the waffle). Syrup was thin and sweet, not very maple-y, as I had hoped for a waffle place. If you just order a simple waffle with syrup, I think you'd be disappointed. Pros: fruit bowl came with fresh mangos, pineapples and blueberries (amazing fruit bowl). Sandwiches and kids meal come with side/drink. \"Coffee bar\" and hot sauce bar had nice assortment. Most enjoyable was A.J. She greeted us, took our order and was incredibly friendly and informative. She saved our experience, which dependent on the food/cost, wasn't overly impressive.  We ordered mostly breakfast items and if we were to return might try the lunch/brunch items. I have a feeling those might be stronger than the breakfast items we ordered.",

The bacon was so burnt I wouldn't even give it to my dog. Nevermind that everything had a sort of medal taste to it. I don't know how they cook the hash browns but it had the weirdest flavor. While the waffle was light and crunchy, it also had a weird taste of aluminum. I don't know what caused the flavor, but I suggest they by better ingredients and clean their cooking mediums.

The store specializes in Waffle entrees like waffle pancakes & waffle sandwiches.  They also serve boba and various teas.  The food is pretty good and relatively cheap for $6.  I was expecting it to be $8 but for $6 I can't really complain.  If they raised the prices I might go someplace else.  Breakfast waffle - decent 3/5 - $6.  Comes w/ bacon, ham, egg, and served on a waffle w/ syrup inside.  Also comes w/ a side of chips. -The breakfast waffle is pretty good.  It's really hard to mess up breakfast entrees but this tasted decent.  If you don't like sweet foods I'd recommend getting syrup on the side.  TIPS: -All entrees are served on paper plates (from Costco) & plastic utensils.  Blegh.   -Water is self serve but it tasted a bit odd when I tried it.  I got an OJ instead",

I've been here a lot and have really tried to love this place but After trying most of the menu the food really isn't that good. They are friendly and fast service but nothing is really that tasty. The bacon seems to be precooked and just reheated which tastes fine in the sandwich but not on it's own. The hash brown is like the frozen patties you buy and just deep fry- nothing special. The eggs are fluffy and perhaps poured from a carton and on the mushy side but again, in the sandwich they're good but we ordered a side of them and it was mushy. The waffles are average but the breakfast sandwich is where it's at. It comes with potato chips on the side which is interesting but I love the sweet sauce in the sandwich followed by the salty chips. I can't see myself going back here for anything else. If they ever took it off the menu I would probably never come back. They get 3 stars- 1 for friendly service, 1 for quick service, and 1 for the breakfast sandwich.",

Personally have never tried any of their food items, but I have heard people say, \"Order anything, because everything there is delicious!\" We've become regulars to this place for their boba drinks though.   FOR HER: I opt for the FRUIT SMOOTHIES -- lychee is my personal favorite. Honey dew or cantaloupe as a tied second. I add boba to it (additional $0.30 charge).   FOR HIM: He loves the ORIGINAL BOBA TEAS -- the milk one being his favorite. Comes with boba too! He also is a fan of the chocolate smoothie, but does not feel it pairs well with boba.  TIP: They offer happy hour from 2pm-6pm, where drinks are buy one, get one half off which makes it super worth it! :)",

I've had their waffles a couple of times and they're decent. I never make waffles nor do I have anything to make waffles with so this is good when I want it once in a while. I'm partial to sweet versus savory. They do have normal breakfast options if you just want waffles on the side and not dressed up.  Their coffee drinks are also really good!",

A waffle as a bun is not designed to handle the weight of the chicken patty. It was a disaster to eat.  The boba milk teas were probably the most disappointing. The boba tasted old and practically fell apart the moment they hit your mouth. The tea tasted off. Definitely not what you expect when you order boba milk tea.  Not to mention that for the price ($27 for two people), you should get what you expect. My son and I literally drank three sips of our tea and threw it away.  Will not be going back.",

Their banana split waffle is another favorite of mine, I mean who wouldn't love ice cream for breakfast? This dish consists of a regular waffle topped with vanilla ice cream, sliced bananas, whipped cream, sprinkles, and drizzled hot fudge. I mainly come here for the boba because this is the closest and best boba place in North Las Vegas. My two favorite flavors are their taro and chocolate banana smoothies with boba.

They even have a few books for children to read while you wait for your meal. Will definitely be back.",

Never seen so many people on such a short cooking line take 30 minutes to make a scrabble and a waffle with only 1 order for a party of 5 ahead of us... multi tasking is not this staffs strong point. My biggest issue was the only flavors I could describe was burnt sausage and bacon. I would go into further details but not really into writing a book so I will just end with finding any other option would be the best alternative... Carl's Jr. Across the street perhaps.",

The menu is a little overpriced, but could become a better value if the price of the entree at least included a beverage (coffee). The waffles we received were thin (not Belgian style) leading to my opinion about the price. The decor was very plain and the cafe just didn't feel like something you'd experience in Aliante. This review isn't all \"bad\" (the waffles were good), but with a little more effort, this place could become a gem and a place we'd want to choose over competitors such as The Original Pancake House (which I'd personally give 5 stars). Lastly- the staff were friendly and welcoming so they had that going for them.",

Well at least a waffle although they have big banner that states now serving pancakes but really who goes to a Waffle Cafe for pancakes...the name tells you what their specialty is.   Anyway I had a waffle with blueberries, strawberries and bananas. No I passed on the chocolate chips, whipped cream and powdered sugar. Hey I was breaking lose on my food choices but didn't want to go crazy...maybe that why I was carving ribs later that night because I knew I had saved some food karma points :)  Also the staff in this place was very friendly, helpful and fun. It was good to hear youthful energy enjoying their work instead of the normal this is just my job type of employee's. This staff gave good service and enjoyed what they do.    I would definitely come back here good food, good service and fair prices. Oh and I forgot to mention they also have cool smoothies I got the Lychee...yum I love the fruit!",

My dad had a tall stack of pancakes and I had the seasoned potatoes and regular sized yogurt parfait which was full of a variety of fresh fruit, granola, and yogurt.  Everything was delicious!! Kim is patient, friendly, and more than willing to answer questions.  The food is cooked after you order, and it is made with fresh ingredients.  You order at the counter, but your food and drinks are brought to your table. Kim and another person checked on us, refilled our drinks, and cleared away out plates.  So far, I have tried something new on each visit, and I have never been disappointed.  The food is hot and delicious or cold and delicious depending on what you order.  Customers are treated like they are the most important person in the place.  Everyone is friendly and helpful.  Customer service is definitely a priority.  I will definitely be back!",

To pay close to $9 for an over cooked waffle that comes with a blob of melted margarine, yuck, not even real butter or even a choice of which one you want. The waffle pizza is soggy, things are quickly heated so they're cold and cheese doesn't appear to new real cheese, the eggs like rubber, the bacon was paper thin and precooked then reheated, so disgusting, then they serve all that disgust on the cheapest paper plates, not even matching our of good quality, everything soaks right through and years before you cam finish the junk they serve you, and to pay top dollar to get your own food, please. The tables were dirty  and sticky, we had empty cans of soda at the end of our table that was there when we sat down and still there when we left though we asked them to clean the table. The place smelled horrible, no ventilation and looked dirty. The Styrofoam cups was a nice touch for water. OMG, HORRIBLE, horrendous service and food, but they were nice, lol, that's a joke.",

Ordered a waffle with strawberries, blueberries and chocolate chips with a side of eggs, bacon and a hash brown. Food was good and came out quick. Staff greeted us the moment we walked through the door. Yes I had to get my own coffee, but come on, some consider that an inconvenience?

The red velvet waffle with cream cheese drizzle was rich and delicious.  The maple syrup was even a standout.  My hot apple pie waffle was good, except that the apple pie filling was left cold when they put together my waffle.  It would have been much better served warm.  Still, it was delicious!  We will be back.",

    "text": "Our food was good, but the service was not. My husband ordered a pumpkin delight combo, but was given just a pumpkin waffle due to the cashier not knowing how to ring it up properly. When we brought it to their attention, the cook came from the back and stated that we could have the additional toppings after they ring it up. My husband clearly stated he wanted the pumpkin delight waffle and wasn't given what he had ordered. Then they want to charge us extra for the toppings?! For a place that states 'great service' on their business cards, that's not quite 'great service.' On top of that, they gave me the wrong type of bacon. I repeated myself twice to the cashier and they still got it wrong when it came out. In the end, they gave us a full stamp card, which gives us $5 off our next visit, but i would have preferred that the cook to have apologized and given my husband what he ordered. The only person that apologized was the cashier and she stated it was her first day. Under good management, the manger, who seemed to be the cook from the back, should have apologized when she came out and corrected the order at no cost. The new cashier should not have to feel bad for making a mistake and shouldn't have to use her being a new cashier as an excuse. It clearly shows that management does not fully train their employees. This would have been a good training opportunity for the new cashier and manager. If you have a new employee who does something incorrectly, own up to the mistake, apologize, and correct it. Then address the issue after the correction has been made by going over it with your new employee.   My husband and i like the food enough that we will be returning. We just hope management trains their employees well enough so next visit is smoother.",

Regular menu items seem a bit pricey so catch them on their Happy Hour, Everyday 2-6 PM. BOGO 50% off Smoothies (Boba Add'l), Waffle Sandwich & Kettle Chips for $5 and Milk or Thai Tea (Buy 2 Get One Free).  Everything is worth trying. I've had Chicken & Waffles, Waffles with Strawberry & Banana with Chocolate Sauce, Ham and Pineapple Waffle Pizza, Green Tea and Banana Smoothies, Oreo Shakes, Tornado Fries, etc. They were all delicious!  Their waffles are so crunchy and fluffy at the same time. I'm so used to being served soggy waffles so it's a treat coming here.  I've seen reviews critiquing them serving on paper plates and such. I don't find it tacky or anything. There's nothing wrong with that, in my opinion. It doesn't take away from the food being yummy. Just a thought.",

    "text": "Oh Waffles Cafe, I really wanted you to be amazing but I left disappointed, only eating a few bites of my meals that I paid over $20 for. I literally left the food to go eat somewhere else. I was super excited to eat here too because there have been some many five star reviews. I'm leaving two stars because the restaurant was clean and the staff was kind but I was not a fan of my meal at all.   When we walked in we were greeted warmly and I was getting hungry right away. The restaurant is a cute little mom & pop type business with 15 or so table tops and a smaller breakfast bar against the window. The first odd thing I noticed when I walked in was that even after being greeted by the staff behind the counter I wasn't sure if I should seat myself, wait to be seated, or walk to the counter and order.   I could go down the road of pointing out the things I didn't like about our meal, but instead I feel that some constructive criticism might be helpful:   1. The menu is laid out funk and it was hard for me to follow along. It took me a few minutes to figure out what in the heck was going on. I like the idea that you can build your own waffle but making toppings all different prices had me scratching my head. I had no idea what I was spending.....just blindly ordering and I wasn't a fan.   2. The fruit in the fresh fruit did not taste fresh. Mostly it was the bananas that stood out to me. An old banana has a very distinct taste, and I wasn't excited about it. At first glance it looked amazing, but I couldn't say the same after I tasted it. The fruit wasn't cut into nice pieces, it was chopped into lots of smaller pieces that seemed odd. Lets call it more like a diced fruit bowl.   3. We received our meal at different times. First the waffle, then the fruit, then our drinks, then the food they forgot we ordered. By the time all of the food had been delivered on paper plates and bowels I just wanted to leave and did. There were two other customers in the restaurant at the same time as us and they too were asking for the missing items they had ordered.  4. I didn't enjoy the flavor of the waffle batter. It was almost tasted like a sourdough waffle. If you're a fan of sourdough, and I know there are lot of people who are, you may have enjoyed it. For me, it didn't taste at all like my grandmothers waffles on Sunday mornings, and thats the flavor I'm looking for!",

I ordered the blazing chicken & waffle w/ hash browns & an orange smoothie. About 8 minutes later it was in front of me and it was delicious. The waffle was soft (making for a good wrap), the tomatoes and lettuce tastes fresh, and the chicken didn't disappoint either. Overall I think the best description would be fresh & vibrant.  Onto the atmosphere. As stated, Kim was extremely pleasant. The dining room is a mix between a small-ish brunch spot (as youd expect) with some hints of a 50s diner. Theres a flatscreen TV on the wall that was tuned into smooth hits of the 60s, 70s, and 80s that fit well with the mood of the place.  Definitely looking forward to coming back here sometime and trying some of the other interesting menu items.",

As is my \"keep it cheap\" custom, I went directly after the waffle special advertised outside the restaurant.  For $5.49, the diner gets a waffle, an egg made to order, bacon or sausage, and unlimited coffee!!! The coffee is self-serve, with flavored creamers, as well as the creamy creamers.  The waffle was served hot and fresh. It had a slight buttermilk taste to it, but I may be wrong about that.  I upgraded, and added fresh blueberries for $0.75 more.    Other items on the menu include waffle sandwiches, waffle pizza's, smoothies, specialty teas, iced cream shakes, latte's, hot chocolate, soda, and juices.  Another big plus is free WiFi to customers.    If you like to be waited on, this is not your place.  The customer orders their meal at the counter, but the staff brings it to the table.  After that, you get your own coffee.  I'm happy to get the exercise of walking back and forth to the coffee, cream and Splenda.",

There weren't many people there at the time, but the crowd picked up after that. So the menu is much more extensive thanks I was expecting. We always go for classics when trying out a new place, so that what we ordered. The waffle was good, but not anything to really write home about. It too a while to come out and they wee served on disposable plates and plastic ware. Not a huge deal, but I guess I had higher expectations from a place called waffles cafe. So, not horrible, just not sure if ilk be running back for more anytime. If you've had and enjoy blueberry hill waffles you will more than likely be dissatisfied.  It's a cute place and they seem to have a nice following, so try it and see what you think. Maybe the waffle with lots of toppings are better.",

My aunt and I go about once a month when we get a hankering for a waffle (when you are constantly one a diet and trying to lose weight you have to splurge a little:) and the waffles we get are quite good.  We both just go old school and get the classic waffle with some fruit on it and that's about it but the price is reasonable and they always seem done and have a nice crunch to it.  The wait time can be a little long especially for not a busy place but I think they keep just one or two people on as staff and that could make the wait time a bit slow.  Overall I think its a yummy neighborhood spot.",

We walked in and noticed that this place was not at all efficient in their service. They have one cashier and not a big enough space to stand in line. We waited over 35 minutes for 2 waffle breakfast sandwiches. It was ridiculous. We brought it up to the manager and he told us that 30 minutes was the average wait time. That should not be acceptable. Each sandwich was $7 and the description said it was loaded with egg, cheese , ham and bacon. Yet another disappointment. It had one flat egg, 2 small pieces of bacon, a small sliver of ham and small amount of cheese. Overall, I would not recommend this place to anyone; unless you enjoy overpriced waffles and a very long wait for food.",

    "text": "I think, what's really attracted me to this place, is the fact of them having strawberry smoothie with boba and adding protein. That, plus its just a few miles away from home. Way better, then driving to Chinatown, and finding a place that will add protein to a strawberry smoothie with boba.   I found this place, to be unique, cause I rarely see anything like it. I'm sure there are others out there, but I haven't been living in Vegas that long to experience what locals experience. I guess you can say I'm still trying to find my way around Vegas. Just so happen, that we found our way to Waffles Cafe in Aliante.   First time around, I tried their Smore's Waffle, which was different, and sweet. I'm a bit marshmallow fan, that I had to try it and see. It wasn't to bad, but kind of sweet for breakfast. Second time around, I tried their Pepperoni Pizza Waffle. Which may sound odd or the sound of it, may make you wonder, how it taste. But quite honestly, it wasn't as bad as I thought. The fact, that I like pizza, is great, but the fact of it being on a waffle, made it interesting. I guess you can say, its a pizza, with a really soft crust.   The staff, was very nice, and made sure that everything was okay. But, the staff only consist of two Asian ladies. The place itself, look very nice and clean. Knowing that its fairly new, business there, seems really slow and when we usually go, its like 0-3 other people are in there. The only thing I'm not satisfied with, is the pricing. Even though its good, from my point of view, I don't think the pricing fits it, that well. I'm sure business would probably be better if it was probably a dollar cheaper.   I would probably say, if your into trying something unique and different, you should try it. I would definitely do the smoothie. I prefer boba with protein, but I'll leave that up to you. Again, the pricing is a bit more then expected, but its worth trying.",

It took a long time for us to even get our food. It felt like people who came in after us, were getting their food before us and we only had two in our party. Definitely wasn't happy about waiting as long as we did for our food. I got the chicken and waffle plate and he got the ice cream sundae waffle. They were both good, but I don't think they were super. I will say the strawberry butter that they give you for the chicken and waffle didn't go very well. I'm glad I only put it on half of my waffle. I won't do that again. The sundae waffle was good too, but it was super sweet to eat for breakfast.

As far as taste goes, waffles are fluffy and have a nice texture to them. They have no flavor on their own, which is usual, but it makes up for that with their topping choices! I was not able to taste the pancake that my son got but from his 9 year old mouth \"it was like dessert and pancake deliciousness , it was like a party!\" We also got bacon and hash browns which aren't too special. Definitely give it a try if you have a sweet tooth and are looking for a fun breakfast, but also if you just want breakfast, because they have plenty of other savory options!",

We ordered a grilled chicken sandwich and a turkey club; the sandwiches came with a choice of chips, waffle fries, or hash browns... we chose the waffle fries. The meal was delicious and well priced at $6.95 (did not order drinks, water was available by condiments counter).  There's a huge menu on the wall; it can look intimidating so just grab a menu near the register if you need extra time. I love that the first items on the menu are desserts; they deserve their place, front and center!",

Strawberry butter for my waffle, and the blueberry syrup is light on weight but prominent on flavor. My son met a new friend here and immediately turned into a play date.

It's posted by the register that they use the best ingredients so I was excited in tasting my waffle order.    To my disappointment, the waffles tasted terrible without whip cream and syrup.  The batter quality is substandard; thin, tasteless, cardboard-flavor.  I gave it another shot by dunking this waffle into my Starbucks coffee but it's unpalatable to me.  I shredded them into pieces and used it as bird food; They seemed to enjoy it!  What a waste of my $5.  Next time I'll invest this money into a breakfast buffet giving me assortment of waffles, pancakes and the likes.  So, so disappointed :(  I'm giving a one star for good customer service on Kim's part!",

We walked in and were asked if we have dined here before, after saying no the employee asked if we needed her to go over the menus. I thought this was very nice considering all of the staff being younger and really caring about our experience. We ordered and sat where we wanted. Upon sitting the owner was in the back and greeted many who walked in. We didn't wait too long for our meal and everything was fresh. We ordered an orange smoothie and a cantaloupe bona smoothie super refreshing! Chicken and waffles along with a red velvet waffle. The chicken tenders on the waffle was absolutely scrumptious. All white meat, i didnt have to dissect through any of the meat which I tend to do because im extremely picky with my white meat. Comes with a blazing sauce which isn't too spicy, your choice of maple syrup (flavored, plain or sugar free) and a wonderful strawberry butter on top DIVINE. The red velvet pancake didnt really burst with red velvet flavor for me. It was topped with whipped cream, powdered sugar and a sweet glaze on top and on the side should you require more. It was  a sweet treat to end out chicken and waffles brunch item. My husband loved the red velvet, I on the other hand was just ok with it, but it wasn't bad, just super sweet and he picked the item so i wont take any stars for that because its a personal preference really. Just know its very sweet, if you love that then try it! The price point in super affordable compared to actual Diners. $8.50 for the chicken and waffles and $4.50 for the red velvet. Smoothies range based on size and if you want boba beads or other toppings $3.99-5.99-ish. They offer happy hour specials after 2pm on the drinks buy one get one 50% off SWEET! I totally would come back and recommend anyone to give this place a try. Oh the owner also came over to our table to check on everything, nice touch!",

This is the best breakfast place I've ever been too! I love their menu giving you options between a set waffle or a build your own. We both built our own and I am so glad we did. They were delicious!! We both got a flavored waffle with fruit. The fruit is so fresh and sweet you don't want to douse it in syrup. The waffles aren't cloyingly sweet, even the red velvet with cream cheese drizzle, and are the perfect size to be pleasantly filling. Their sides are so yummy too! The potatoes are crispy and well seasoned and their grits are delicious! The staff is so sweet too! As soon as you walk in you are welcomed from every staff member and then asked if it's your first time or greeted by name if not. They walk you through the menu and find out exactly what you want. Then when your food is ready the cutest, sweetest woman comes out with it and asks what else she can bring, a selection of warm syrups, butter, ketchup, hot sauce you name it!  My husband and I loved the restaurant and unless they build one in St George Ut we will definitely be back!!",

This is how everyone in the restaurant received their meals. What a waste!",

    "text": "After a long morning of fasting, having blood drawn, and sitting at the DMV, my husband and I were STARVING on Thursday morning, and decided to look up someplace nearby for breakfast.    Pulling up my trusty Yelp app, I located Waffles Cafe, and we decided to check it out.   Upon entering, we were greeted warmly by Kim, who I found out a little later is the owner.  She asked if we'd been in before, and after finding out that we hadn't, let us know that if we had questions about the menu, to just ask, and she's more than happy to help.    The menu is big, but not too overwhelming.  I had a hard time picking because everything looked wonderful.   We decided on:  Chicken and waffles for my fella, and the \"create your own\" waffle combo for me.   I've seen a couple reviews knocking the place because they use paper plates and plastic utensils, but it didn't bother me at all.  At least the plates/cups are biodegradable.    The thing is, this isn't a fancy restaurant or a chain like Ihop or Denny's.  Its super cute, super clean (like...she wipes down the hot sauce bottles after they've been used), and cozy.  I'm not so pretentious to be bothered by eating off paper plates.    I also ordered a taro boba drink, which was heavenly.  Boba was the perfect consistency.    When the food arrived, everything was HOT.  Like...I burned my mouth on the grits, hot.    Fella's chicken and waffles were good.  We're 99% sure that the chicken is breaded in house and not store bought.  They were tasty.  Not greasy at ALL, which thrilled me.   The chicken came with this sauce...we think its a honey mustard type base with hot sauce, and it is DELICIOUS.  I'd eat this all day long.  Fella's waffle was really good too.    I opted for the \"create your own\" waffle combo.  This is exciting, because there are at least 5 or 6 different waffle bases for you to choose from: Original, Gluten free, Red Velvet, Chia Seed, Flax seed...SO many to choose from!   For Thursday's visit, I chose the original batter, with pecans.  (there were LOTS of other toppings, but I was in the mood for simple)  The combo comes with 2 sides and a drink.  I chose bacon, grits, and did my boba slushie, with an upgrade charge.    So the waffle itself comes with powdered sugar and whipped cream.  We had regular syrup too.  The waffle was really good.  Crunchy on the outside, moist on the inside...perfect.    The grits were burn your mouth hot, but delicious.  Best grits I've had in ages, truth be told.  Throw in a little butter (which it came with on the side)...mmmm.  I was in heaven.  The bacon was cooked well.  I wish there was more than 2 pieces to a side, but I think that's pretty standard for \"sides\" of bacon at other places too.  Who doesn't want more bacon all the time anyway?    We were checked on a couple of times, but not too many.  Service really was top notch.    I definitely plan to return, there are lots of items on the menu that I want to try out!!",

We walked to the counter to be greeted by a friendly face who was more than happy to answer questions since it was our first time there. My boyfriend and I both got Waffle Combos. I got a chocolate chip waffle, grits with butter and scrambled eggs. To drink I got a hot chai latte.  The waffle was absolutely delicious and as someone who doesn't typically have a sweet tooth, I ate that waffle so quickly because of how good it was. The eggs were cooked perfectly and I devoured the eggs and as for the grits, delicious and buttery. The chai latte was a perfect and delicious classic that went super well with my breakfast. My boyfriend got an iced vanilla latte and honestly, it was probably some of the best coffee I've ever tasted.  True home-cooked meals and it shows in the taste and quality. The staff was so nice and welcoming and they laughed with us. The atmosphere is warm and homey and I was just really quite happy we stumbled across this place.  My boyfriend and I decided every time we come visit vegas, we'll make it a point to come here for brunch!  Highly recommend!",

The service was excellent which you rarely find nowadays when it comes to teens and customer service. Which basically tells me the management has trained their staff well and management is good to the employees. Btw we met the owners and they were very nice and friendly. They were in the kitchen with the staff working just as hard(which is True leadership). The food, oh my, was awesome. Daughter had red velvet yummo! I had gluten free yummo! The grits were exellent! I'm glad we took a chance. We will definitely be back.",

Went back 3rd day but they were already closed so I suggest getting meat entree early in the day. Would be nice if they extended their hours in the evening .

The sever who also worked the register was very nice and that means a lot to me when I go out to eat. There coffee was hot and didn't have that bitter taste you get some times. I ended up getting the blazing chicken and waffle which is like a waffle chicken finger sandwich. Which as I am writing my mouth is watering for one. Also it came with waffle fries. Get it? Lol. Anyways, my daughter got the pumpkin delight and loved it. This is a local small business joint and we will be back. Need more places like this in North Las Vegas.",

They recently remodeled the place and I think it looks great! They are very clean and always greet customers as soon as they walk in the doors. I love that they have a coffee station, I can refill my coffee and put a different flavor of creamer and it's just a cute setup! I always recommend to my friends. Don't forget the stamp card too!",

Korean BBQ Waffle ($8.95): Top Sirloin Beef marinated in Korean seasonings. This is essentially a Bulgogi Waffle, but the meat was too thick, tough, and not full of flavor. Also, the waffle is not as \"done\" as the other location, and it isn't the reason WHY I go to the other location....the amazing waffles!  Would not recommend at all.   I tried the Large Peach Smoothie with Boba ($5.29). This is pretty good.  I like their boba here.

Whatever it was, I wasn't into it.   THe eggs were plentiful, but, tasted like they were made with water and not milk.   Coffee, the coffee was just bad.   A couple of lights burned out.

The owner is cheerful and very sweet to each and every customer. She even remembered my name. Which isn't an easy one . The entire staff is super friendly to be honest and still very professional. I like that. The atmosphere is relaxed like a coffee shop but with a sweet smell always in the air that screams southern home-cooked breakfast.  So far my favorites are the red velvet waffle and the chicken wings. The wings are actual seasoned perfectly and taste home cooked. My husband is a bacon-freak so he loves the \"Kimmie's BLT Xplosion\" it's loaded with bacon. My kids like the \"tornado fries\" Definitely check this place out!!! Good customer service + Good food. Oh and they have a selection of unique waffle batters including some healthy ones too! Enjoy!!!",

We tried the Chicken & Waffles, one with tenders and one with chicken wings. O.MG. Hands down the best chicken and waffles in Vegas. Everything is made fresh, the chicken is fresh, the fruit is yummy. I love it. A lot of places say they make all their food fresh - but you can tell when they've just thaw out a bunch of frozen chicken nuggets - this place is actually legit.

It took me quite a while to decide because the menu descriptions along with the pictures made everything look tasty. I finally decided on a cherry blossom waffle combo with bacon and potatoes. I figured since I had just gotten over a cold, ice cream on my waffle would be beneficial to me.   The food was awesome. I was extremely upset because I could not find anything to complain about. I suppose I could say nobody would tie my shoes, but I love Vans slip-ons. I'll definitely be back. Next time though I'm going to find some shoes that tie...",

It doesn't even look appetizing   The customer service probably is poor because the owner has a BAD ATTITUDE when questioned.  This place is really a self serve spot.

There's more to running a business than just cooking and serving food. .I wanted to tell her how the chicken was fried to our liking and that the food was great but unfortunately we never got the chance because she never came to our table...",

I ordered the build your own waffle combo, that comes with a waffle, 2 sides and a drink. The sodas are in 16.9oz bottles, no soda fountain or free refills. The plates and silverware are all disposable.  There was nothing special about the scrambled eggs or bacon that I ordered.  The waffle I ordered came with strawberries and kiwi at a extra charge of $1.00 for each fruit. There is a couple of different syrups to chose from and are warm.  I can honestly say that the waffle didn't taste amazing at all. There was nothing special about it either.  Overall I wasn't really impressed.",

The seating area is fair, the counter is small. The staff was friendly but way in the weeds with customers and so many mobile orders.  I was told my food needed a few more minutes, that's fine. Overall my wait was 20 minutes in the store not counting the drive over. So, 30 minutes to get a waffle, waffle sandwich and a smoothie.  Unfortunately after all that time I got back to the hotel and found that the order was wrong. I had ordered a custom pumpkin waffle with apples but got a plain waffle with syrup. My gracious daughter said it was still good, but I was upset I paid extra for the custom food I didn't get. The rest of the food was good, but because of the wait, I don't think I'd go back for breakfast at least. They have a good product and friendly staff. They might just need to hire additional help or move a little faster.",

When we arrived it was around 9am so it was not too busy but as we finished ordering and sat down to wait for our food the place began filling up and got pretty busy which was a good sign our food would be good. The woman who took our order was nice and in a happy mood considering the holiday and the man who brought out our food was just as friendly. He even came back a second time to provide us syrup options that he later came back with. Cool little fancy syrup dispensers too! I got the chicken and waffles and WOW I will definitely be back that was amazing especially with the spicy buffalo sauce.",

The young man with the gorgeous curly hair at the register was soooo helpful explaining the menu to us being that it was our first visit. And might I add he was the most professional, well mannered, polite young man I've ever come across. There whole staff was just amazing !!!  So whomever is doing the training here needs a medal and to train other businesses how to give great customer service! If you haven't tried waffles cafe you're missing out!!!! We will definitely be back!  thank you again for the incredible service and crazy delicious food!!!",

What I got wasn't that. It was a glorified chicken nugget. Processed, spongey, and all.  My tip to the establishment: don't call giant nuggets \"tenders\".  Other than that, the food was decent.

Loved the strawberry butter and the homemade hot sauce.   Keep it up alliante, lots of great family businesses and I plan to support them all.",

    "text": "This waffle joint is a half mile from Aliante Casino.  When my relatives start hitting the slots, they say I'm bad luck if I watch, so they tell me to scram.\"We'll be here a half hour, see you then...\"  They say they kinda feel sorry for me, but they get over it, and so do I.  Why?  It gives me an excuse to head to Waffles Cafe.   Carbs rarely ever taste this good.  I love waffles, and this waffle by itself is near perfect -  light, slightly sweet, tender, and slightly crispy all at the same time.  When it comes out warm, no matter what it's topped with, it's heavenly.  This time, I opted for the peaches and strawberries.  The peaches were sliced canned cling peaches, which I like, but I loved the sliced fresh strawberries with a dollop of whipped cream in the middle.  I decided to get it to go and eat it in the parking lot of the casino, well aware the Casino videotapes the parking lots.  All I can say to the security staff watching my one tape, \"Get your own!\" The aromatic, juicy berrie slices were naturally sweet with the waffle, the peaches were a good contrast visually, in taste, and texture.   The variety of waffles is fantastic, you can order one of their pre made concoctions, or create your own.  There is nutella, pumpkin, pecan, apples, blueberries, and so many others.  They have a great $5.49 breakfast waffle special with egg, bacon or sausage, and can add hash browns for a price. Of course, waffle sandwhiches are popular, too.   They had some bobas and teas.  But I had their Columbian coffee to go, it was decent, though I prefer my coffees bolder (i.e. French Roast) but it was a great accompaniement to my sweet dessert.  All told, it was about $8.  Definitely, I'll come back again.  My relatives didn't win this time, but in a half hour, I was far happier and my wallet was heavier than theirs.",

When I went I had a blazing chicken and waffle, which fulfilled my need for sweetness, savory, and tangy all at the same time. I also had an order of waffle fries and tornado fries. The only reason I could not give them the full five stars was because there was nothing exceptional there that would make me crave waffle cafe. Other than that it was a great experience.",

    "text": "This Waffles Cafe is tasty!  It is also a fun cafe with so many lovely waffle options.  YUM!  This location is very nice.  It is bright and very open.  I have visited some of the other locations and they seem cramped, but not this one!  Lots of room to sit and relax and enjoy your waffle.  This location was also spotless!  They must have elves here to come out and clean, because it was absolutely spotless! It is also super casual, so it is a nice break from your everyday life.  The staff here is super friendly as well.  Everyone really seemed to welcome you and make you feel comfortable.  I just love great customer service and really appreciate it when I get it!  That gets Waffles a bonus star from me!  The food is yummy too.  On this visit I had the chicken & waffle.  It was really good.  It was different than I have ever had it before, so that was fun.  The waffles here are the size of the plate they come on and are of the thinner variety.  The waffle batter has something special in it, but I can't quite figure it out.  I think it is vanilla and maybe cinnamon?  I'm not sure, but they are yummy.  The chicken of the dish was 3 chicken fingers.  They tasted good, but weren't anything special.  What made the dish different was that it came with strawberry butter and a spicy hot sauce to go with the food.  The sweet, fruity butter went great with the food and I would order that on any waffle any time!  The spicy, thick, hot sauce was an interesting flavor and actually went well with the sweetness of the butter.  I know it sounds strange, but it really worked.   If you are into dessert style waffles, this is your place as well.  The have all sorts of options like apple pie filling, chocolate, pumpkin, strawberry, and a lot more to satisfy your sweet tooth.  They actually have more dessert varieties than breakfast and savory dishes.  YUMMY!  If you are into fancy teas like Thai, Boba, or Fruit teas, then you are REALLY in luck since they have about 3 dozen or tea varieties to make your taste buds happy.    I think the prices are a bit high for what you get, which is why I dropped them in the score.  The entree waffles all seem about a $1-2 too high for what you actually receive.  If the prices were a bit less, I would be at Waffles a lot more for sure.",

Unfortunately far as service and quality I was a bit under satisfied. For 2 potatoe scrambles and a half waffle we waited nearly a half hour. The kitchen itself had more than 6 people in it, the establishment itself had 3 parties that came after us and that was it for patrons in the restaurant. We watched parties get served and finished there entire meal before we even got ours. I could totally understand if they were busy but to have that many staff In the kitchen and to have so many open tables and having patrons wait that long i can't understand. Unfortunately I will not be coming back. To add to it, we ordered take out, and on the bottom of all 3 of our to go boxes were all holes. Why do take out boxes have holes on the bottom???? My rating was at 5, now down to 1. Staff you were nice but unfortunately quality of service was just not what it used to be....",

The waffle is fluffy, crispy on the outside, warm and soft on the inside The chicken was my favorite it was so tender.. The plastic knife cut through it like butter  They add this buffalo style sauce but so delicious definitely coming back for this same plate.   My boyfriend got some red velvet pancakes with fresh kiwi and strawberries the pancakes were fluffy and delicious as well   The reason why i don't give it 5 stars is because i thought it was a little pricey and it took about 20 minutes for us to get our food.. Which could be because it was a busy Sunday morning   Overall great place if you live in the area",

Now the food review. Simply, the smoothie was delicious. The big win.  Duringy brief wait, I took a look around and it's a pleasant looking place, simple in decor. Not fancy but perfect for a breakfast joint.  They also have, wait for it... waffles. They look pretty tasty. They advertise organic and gluten free foods. Also on the menu are Boba teas and spiral cut potatoes on a stick.   Reasonable pricing, quick friendly service, and a very tatsy smoothie. They have all three restaurant issues covered.  I'd really like to try their other foods, but it's a long drive for me to get up here. But I'll certianly remember them and will stop in if I'm on this side of town again.",

We sat at the table and the server brought us menus to browse.  I was amazed by all of the different selections of waffles they offer! They even make waffle pizza!!! They also offer boba drinks and smoothies too! The dining area is fairly large and kept clean. You do have options to build your own waffle with a variety of toppings you can add on for additional prices. My mom and I both ordered breakfast combos which comes with a waffle and 2 breakfast sides and a drink. My son ordered a breakfast sandwich with waffle fries. I did find that the waffles were a little under cooked which left an unpleasant after taste of yeast. I was a little bummed because it left me not being able to finish my waffle that I had built my way :'(  Overall experience the service is great and wait time for your food is quick.  I will definitely try this restaurant again!!!",

The texture of the waffles are JUST RIGHT! The Chicken and Waffles were scrumptious. It is an art to create wings that are tender and juicy with just the right crisp. The strawberry cream and the creamy homemade hot sauce that comes with this is WOW!  Not to mention the teas! The pineapple tea has an aromatic flavor that actually blew my mind, honestly. The mango tea is sweet, but savory. ALL NATURAL!   The customer service is A1!!!  We look forward to coming back and supporting this asset to Las Vegas!",

    "text": "First thing wrong was you have to go up to the register to order, then you have to pay and your options are no tip or start off with 15 percent tip on their automated payment method.   2nd thing wrong, they serve their meals on paper plates and plastic utensils. 3rd thing wrong, they didn't bring our food out all at the same time...I think they messed up the order. 4th thing wrong, the waffles were under cooked and mushy, the fried chicken was burnt, the sausage was over cooked. 5th thing wrong, the waffles had a horrible after taste and I was sick for about two hours after eating there.   My grandchildren hated it, we threw their waffles and chicken away.  I really don't understand how they could have 4 star reviews with so many reviewers.  This was probably the worse place I've ever eaten.",

We had a mix of classic and red velvet waffles. I was able to try both and really couldn't decide which I liked better. I had half of an original topped with their syrup, strawberries and some whipped cream and half of the red velvet topped with bananas, chocolate chips & whipped cream.   The portion sizes were very generous and more than enough food for 45+ people. I can't wait to visit their physical restaurant and try more. Their menu prices looks very reasonable & there's options for both breakfast & lunch items. It's definitely worth a drive from Summerlin for me.",

We've always ordered the chicken and waffles, one order with tenders the other with wings and by golly gee gosh it was outstanding. The wait for chicken was about 12 minutes as quoted and it was worth every minute! The owners do everything right from the strawberry butter to the chicken dipping sauce. Also, they offer specialty syrup when you dine in. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was because I ordered drinks for the first time including a pineapple, orange, mango smoothie and a chai latte and they came a while after we had our food. The smoothie was so damn good I would have preferred more time alone with that heavenly drink. It was perfect! See y'all again soon!",

The entire staff was so nice, it was truly a pleasure and I hope they didn't find me too picky.   ALSO, they will sub almond milk for yogurt in their smoothies! I had the lychee flavor. They have an incredible amount of flavors. Go check it out!",

    "text": "I visited Waffles Cafe while recently in town after finding this place through Yelp. I saw that the reviews were \"okay\" so decided to give it a chance but unfortunately, the food was really bad. There are a a variety of menu options; which I thought was a good thing but my meal left a lot to be desired. My friend and I decided to split an order of chicken and a waffle. Do NOT order this! The \"chicken\" was a serving of frozen chicken fingers aka not real chicken and the waffle was completely bland. Thank God for the strawberry butter they gave me to spread onto my waffle because it made it edible.   It's unfortunate that I can't rate this place higher because the atmosphere inside is truly adorable and their staff was outstanding. Everyone I came in contact with was extremely friendly and helpful and they all were wearing a smile; which was really refreshing.   I liked the idea of this place much more than I liked the actual food but for the most part, I enjoyed my experience there, thanks to the great staff. One really cool thing that I liked was the wall of names, sayings, etc...   Tip: If you ask the server to use the label maker, she'll print off your name or whatever you like for you to stick on the wall. As a tourist, I thought that was a nice touch.",

(Otherwise I may never would have come all the way out here from Henderson!)  I had the pumpkin waffle with Nuttella and pecans and a hot chai tea. The waffle itself was good, crispy edges and a tender inside, but not really very pumpkiny (although I haven't had their original flavor waffle so maybe there really is a difference in taste.) The pecans added just enough crunch and the Nuttella...well, how can you go wrong with Nuttella? It came with a dollop of whipped cream which was perfect since it cut the sweetness of the Nuttella. The tea was a standard hot tea bag but they were eager to refill the water with no hesitation.   On the way out I ordered a taro boba to go. The drink itself was standard but the boba was pretty mushy, like they were leftover from the day before. Too bad.   Service was great but business was slow. While I was here there were only two other people who came in to eat. The two Asian ladies working (the owner and her sister) were very sweet and personable.  I'd go again if I'm in the area but I won't be making any special trips out there.",

    "text": "Nice place and good concept for expanding the waffles. I went with my sister and we ordered the supreme pizza waffle, BBQ chicken waffle, and Jeff's favorite which had apple n ice cream with whip cream.   The BBQ chicken was ok. The waffle was drenched in BBQ sauce. It was too much to take. The chicken was dry. There was also pineapples which I thought was strange to have on a BBQ chicken pizza. Overall it was ok.   The supreme pizza waffle was ok too. They should've put more cheese.   The Jeff's favorite was the best out of the three but it would've been better if the apples were warm rather than cold.",

    "text": "This is a small cafe, maximum capacity of 45. With that said, staff didn't appear to be prepared to provide the best customer service. There were only a few tables of customers when we walked in. Yet we were not greeted at all, and being our first time, we weren't sure of the ordering process. There was a bell to ring for assistance. Which in my opinion, is not the best way to get the staff's attention. It's just a distraction to other customers dining, and you get awkward looks from everyone. Now for the food, ordered 2 waffle combos, original and red velvet. You pay at the time of ordering with tip option. Which we anticipated the best so we tipped 20 %. But for being a \"family recipe\", waffles did not fair well against other restaurants such as, IHOP. The flavor of the batter didn't stand out, nor did the texture. And toppings are just that, topped on. Chocolate chips and blueberries are not baked into the batter. Not sure if this is an option? Eggs are very runny. Note to self, always ask for scrambled hard. Thai tea with Boba does not taste like traditional.  The tea tasted like it was a Chai blend, and the Boba was not sweet at all. Blueberry syrup, seasoned potatoes are excellent! The Columbia roasted coffee is also great. Unfortunately, this was not our best choice for breakfast. There is room for improvement in the pace of their customer service, and quality of food. I lived in Louisiana many years, and quality of food and customer service/hospitality is what makes or breaks any cafe or restaurant. To their defense, they did say have a good day when we walked out.",

    "text": "I'm not a waffle person so I'm trying to be fair by going with what my waffle eating family has said.  We had the banana split waffle, a caramel pumpkin pecan waffle, and some thai tea minus the bobas.  The banana split was merely ok for me.  Kids loved but what kid wouldn't?   The pumpkin pecan was quite good.  I think I would stick with the pumpkin batter than the traditional.   Their waffles are made well.  Light and crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  The Thai tea could have been a little bit sweeter (I've had better).  I'm not one that likes to fill up on these types of food because I always feel like I'm just putting \"junk\" into my body.   But I think it's a nice get away from the normal \"sweet tooth\" or desert outting for ice cream.  We'll be back for an occasional treat but not to eat the food as a meal.  I feel like it's just A-ok but I'm putting into consideration that I'm not a big waffle eater.  So, 4 stars for being a unique treat.",

The tornado fries were hard as rock with no flavor. The fruit was not fresh like it used be. With all of this, the food was over-priced for its quality.

The waffles tasted as if they're seasoned with savory spices and the texture was that of a freezer waffle. Chicken was overly salty, the meat smelled and tasted as if the meat had gone bad and they were fried in old oil.  I was only able to get through three bites of the meals before I had to stop because I couldn't stomach anymore. The meal didn't even smell appetizing.  Add TERRIBLE customer service to the list. Just got off the phone with the manager and she was beyond RUDE! Her attitude was completely HORRENDOUS! She yelled and hung up the phone TWICE. Uncourteous and unprofessional.",

It is smaller inside, but can accommodate moderately large parties. Everything is waffle based! I ordered the breakfast sandwich, which was eggs, ham, bacon, special sauce wedged between 2 waffle halves. Super yum! Hunny ordered the chicken and waffles - if you do NOTHING else in this life, you must order chicken here. It was amazing!!!! I wanted to order just chicken to go. It was crispy & juicy. We got fingers, but they have wings too (the table next to us ordered wings and it took all my fat girl will power not to steal them!) The waffle batter is made in house, and it was good! They also have strawberry butter, a special hot sauce for the chicken & traditional maple syrup. I wish they had one on our side of town because this would become our go to spot, but until then, hunny will just have to brave the 35 minute drive to get out there! Definitely worth trying if you are near Aliante!",

No complain about the service but until today I thought service was everything, great service without quality products still isn't gonna bring people again.

She was very apologetic and offered to give me a $5 credit on my next order. I thanked her and ate the waffle but was not a fan. I was craving pancakes this morning, so I decided to give this place another try. I didn't use the $5 credit. I just paid full price. I ordered pancakes. They delivered a waffle. Again. I called again and spoke to an employee. She put me on hold and told someone about the mistake. They chuckled about it and gave me an option for a $5 credit on my next order or $1 refund because of the price difference between the pancake and waffle. I took the $1 refund because I don't plan on ordering from this place again. I recommend that they do a little better at checking the accuracy of the orders before sending them out for delivery.",

I knew from reading the reviews that we would be dining off of paper plates and using plastic silverware.   The food took awhile to come out. We had to get our own coffee and water. I ordered the chocolate waffle with strawberries and banana slices. It was just okay. It really didn't taste like a chocolate batter. The plastic silverware made it difficult to cut my waffle. My boyfriend ordered a breakfast combo that had a waffle with peanut butter and chocolate sauce with a side of eggs and bacon. Both of us agreed that the bacon tasted like it had been cooked in used oil from the Chinese restaurant next door. Disgusting. His waffle was fine, but he didn't care for the eggs.   The grossest thing was when he went to put salt and pepper on his food. He picked up the shakers and they literally stuck to his fingers, all dirty with syrup and who knows what else on the outside.    We threw our punch card that was given to us in the trash on the way out and will be making our waffles at home from now on.",

I had the spicy chicken and waffle sandwich with waffle fries. I have to say, those were the absolute best waffle fries I have ever had! They were cooked perfectly!! The sandwich was amazing! The sauce that they put on it should be bottled and sold in stores!!! And its homemade!! The best part was the prices!! Everything was between $5-$8!!!! More than affordable for great quality and perfect portions!! I will definitely be back, and take my whole family next time!! GREAT place!!!!",

I had a waffle sandwich and well as surprising as that sounds it was very good. It had fresh avocado and bacon as well as ham and it was superb! Alright more about the place. Well,  it has a pretty decent sized menu filled with what ever waffle fantasy creation you could think of and the prices are under $10 but above 5$ for almost all plates or waffle creations! The restaurant has lots of seating as well if you felt like you need to bring your football team or large family for some waffle goodness =)",

I hope this place doesnt go away like many of the other stores that have been in this shopping center. It's never crowded (I'm usually the only one in there).

If management lack this degree of attention to detail, I wonder if they are checking the expiration date on their eggs (not a good first impression). Another issue was the server brought out 2 trays for our food and placed 1 tray onto a neighboring table (where guests were sitting!!) while she served us. MAJOR NO NO! You never place a guests food on another guests table. YIKES! ~ Lastly, the price was high when considering you have to stand to place your order, eat on paper plates and use plastic utensils..oh, can clear your own table. ($30 for 3 waffle orders with no drinks)",

I ordered a simple waffle w/ strawberries and bananas w/ a side order of a hashbrown. my husband got just a simple pancake. our total came out to $15! totally over priced. we were brought out what i ordered but my husbands never came. after 5 minutes i inquired about his & after investigating they said they didn't ring it up & said we would have to pay. I almost wanted to yell across the room to my husband not to pay because by then I had bitten into my waffle & it was def nothing special. Hard and non flavorful. the hashbrown literally was taken out of a box and dipped in grease. At the same time another customer had the same problem, ordered something & did not receive it & had to repay. the paper plate and plasticware was not the best choice & made it hard to cut up the waffle. Overpriced. Non quality food. def sticking to making our own waffles!",
