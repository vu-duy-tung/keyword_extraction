It's all about the grub here!  Being my first outing, I decided on the Massaman curry, as it had been reviewed favorably by fellow yelpers on more than one occasion. Verdict?  Excellent! Great flavor, and extremely well prepared. I may even try it a bit spicier next time!  For a kicker, I went with the chicken satay app. Very nice...really tasty.  Do not hesitate to give this place a try.  It's very, very good, and the owners appreciate their customers.",

Tried twice, green curry was swimming w not much on the beef and veg front, possibly catering to the toothless. Singapore noodles were bland. Had some other take out dishes that were unmemorable. Was a shame as had decent ratings but was last there 6 mos ago.   Tip would be to not try to put too much on the menu and focus on what food is your talent. Specialising in such a broad array of Asian food is signing yourself up for trouble. You will have better success narrowing down menu with your strengths and not throw items on you believe will be a draw for people when in fact it detracts.",

    "text": "I tried three items from David Wong`s Pan Asian, and I'm still deciding what I think. It's not bad, and others rave about this place.    Won ton soup: The broth and vegetables were nice. Bok choy must be the prettiest vegetable on earth. The dumplings/won tons were not enjoyable, though, and they are the heart of the soup. I found them to be absolutely flavorless.   Fried tofu: I've had fried tofu before, in tofu massaman.  Separately, however, I hated it!  I can't blame the restaurant for this- I may just not be a fan of fried tofu. It had NO flavor whatsoever. Thank goodness for the attractive, slightly spicy and very tasty sauce  that came with it, otherwise I might have thrown the tofu away.  Massaman:  The potatoes were fully cooked, and that's important, since almost every massaman I've had in restaurants included undercooked potatoes. These potatoes are attractively cut, too.  I also detected thick carrots and - possibly- sweet potato mixed in with a few pieces of chicken and bell pepper.  I was disappointed in the thin sauce, and wish the portion size had been a bit larger. The flavor was all right, but I've tasted massaman elsewhere that I liked much better.  My friend tried the pho and loved it.  The delivery guy said this is a popular restaurant, so I'll likely try it again to see what everyone is raving about.",

I enjoy Asian cuisine from time to time, yet I could eat here everyday for the rest of my life -- Chef Lisa is that damn good! The owner David Wong is very nice too! I should've reviewed this place long ago, as we've eaten here dozens of times. I would say top 5 all-time favorite places to eat, period. Very authentic, very fresh.  FAV's: DW Fried Rice, THAI HOT times 1,000 w/lime (still not hot enough). I was never a fan of curry, but my gf says it's great! Garlic/pepper tofu is amazing (you could have chicken instead). Fried ice cream doesn't disappoint.  Good for vegans/vegetarians, or meat eaters.  Basically, go here and eat. Do it. DOOOO IT NOW!!!",

Anyway, the food arrived, still hot in temperature, I ordered the Chicken Tom Khar soup (5 spicy) and the basil sauce with beef (5 spicy) and it was AMAZING! The best asian food ive had in vegas. The soup was perfect, the right amount for one person and the right amount of spiciness. The basil beef was amazing. The quality of the beef is superb,no fat at all and amazing taste and spicyness just right. 100% recommend this place and probably, will not eat asian food from anywhere else from now on.  For the quality of food, id even say the delivery charge is feasable.",

What a treat to again enjoy the warm hospitality and fantastic food that Lisa prepares.    Over the 2 yrs that we patronized their FL location, they got to know us by name along with all of our family members.  This weekend they even recalled various family members favorite dishes - including ours.  We didn't even have to tell them what we wanted to order!  I am not an expert on Thai food or any Asian dishes for that matter.  I just know when something tastes good.  The food is always fresh and piping hot.  I can't take real spicy, so they have always prepared it on the mild side for me.  We have tried many of their dishes.  I encourage asking questions because David will do his best to have you order the right thing for your taste.  One of the things we have always liked is that the food differs from time to time.  That tells us it is made fresh and not taken out of the freezer and microwaved.  For the sake of full disclosure, we didn't know David and Lisa when we first walked in their FL restaurant - just wanted to try the new local restaurant that opened in our neighborhood.  We now consider them friends because they are such lovely people working hard to provide a good experience for their customers.  Why can't all businesses be run this way?",

We had 0 on the pad thai, 3 on the clear noodles, 6 on the panang curry and 10 on the yellow curry.  The owner came out and made sure our friend with the 10 yellow curry had a pitcher of ice water!  He was great.  I sampled everything but the yellow curry and they were all wonderful.  The noodle dishes were all flavorful and had just enough sauce that the noodles weren't a clumpy, sticky mess but coated with deliciousness in every bite.  The panang curry was wonderful.  A little more spice/flavor than a red curry and the chicken was plentiful and tender. The jasmine rice was a nice accompaniment.   I'd like to go back and try their soups maybe for a lunch next time I'm in town.  Just a wonderful experience.  Seating is limited (30 or so) but turns over fairly quickly.  No alcohol but you can BYOB.  We didn't know or I'd have purchased a nice dry Riesling for the spicy dinner.",

They were light and hot. Very tasty. Next  came the Grilled Tiger Shrimp Mango Salad. Enough for three to four people and super delicious. The lime dressing was outstanding. FRESH and lovely with mint and ripe mango. Massaman curry with chicken and basmati rice. It was mild and I wish that I had asked for it hotter. All in all a delightful meal and plenty of left overs for a couple days. Will definitely go back. Looking forward to their Pad Thai and Filet Mignon PHO. When I left the restaurant was filling up with an Asian clientele. Always a good sign!",

Its summer in Las Vegas - figure out how to get that place cooled down!  I'll go back in the winter and see if its better.  Seems to be an issue with a lot of Asian restaurants here in town - hot as crap out side and the AC is barely working.  If restaurant was more comfortable I'd give it a 5",

    "text": "The food was just excellent. First the roti appetizer was excellent, basically fried bread with curry sauce. The chicken satay was also very good, meat was moist and had the best peanut sauce I've tasted so far. Most peanut sauce  I have tasted is usually overpowering with flavor, this sauce was just well blended and flavorful. The Crying Tiger salad was different in a good way, spicy and the dressing had just the right amount of sourness. The Duck curry of course was  our favorite. The meat perfectly moist inside and just crisped right outside. The curry was just a perfect balance with the duck and brought out the flavor from the meat, plus I never thought the grapes in the dish would work but it did. Lastly the fried ice cream was the perfect ending to a wonderful dinner. Lisa the cook is absolutely amazing. Doreen our server was very friendly and informative about our menu selections. David the owner was funny also and kind of kept the place together. The atmosphere was very friendly and casual. Everybody in Las Vegas and out of towners should try this place",

The spice levels are no joke, with a level 8 on Pad See Ew burning my tongue a good amount. Oddly enough, I found it had more kick to me than my friend's spice level 10 linguini, but less of a smoky flavor. The Pad See Ew is well made here, and I have nothing to criticize on it.  The service was prompt and friendly enough, with the chef coming and asking us if we were okay with the spice level a couple of times. Several times people came in and were known by name, always a nice touch for the regulars. If this place was closer to me, I'm sure I'd have been here many times by now.  The only criticism I would have was that the thai ice tea that my friend ordered was too sweet and didn't have enough tea flavor. It was a point of mediocrity in an otherwise budget-friendly and taste-friendly meal.",

It was the aftermath of a red curry with beef, which totally blew my mind in spite of my half-full stomach.  The star of the dish was actually the pumpkin, which works great in this sweet and savory environment.  My only regret was asking for a spicy level of 3, which was hot for me. Yes, I'm a wimp, but I had a 3 pad thai just fine at Archi's. This was like twice as bad.  Like my friend said earlier, if this was located on our side of town, we'd go there every day.

The other dishes you can get tailored to your level spiciness 1 through 10. I can handle spicy food pretty well so me thinking 5 would be medium went for a 6 on my beef pho and a 5 for the fried rice. I guess I overestimated my spicy food macho-ness. Whooo boy it was spicy! My nose was running like crazy. Which is a shame because the pho was bomb! I wanted to drink up all the broth but couldn't handle the heat. Overall it was great food! We'll definitely be back.

The chicken was basically flavorless.   Chicken Massaman Curry: Just OK. Nothing outstanding.   Bummer!! We really wanted to like this place, too!",

We entered and stood by the entrance. The waitress raised her eyes and looked at us several times.  She never greeted us or said anything.  We stood there for 8 minutes and decided to leave.  I never encountered any waitress as rude as this one.  Believe me, I eat out almost every day. I know the difference among the good, the bad and the horrible experience.",

This place had a nice rating score to reviews ratio. I decided to check the menu out and cross-reference any pics in the album. Everything looked pretty good and I kept seeing these noodles. So, I too ordered the chicken linguine noodles. The cashew veggie stir-fry with an extra side of rice. I was feeling really good so I also got a Thai tea. Everything was fresh and was actually really good. The Thai tea was a little extra sweet but that could just be me. The only thing they could improve on is the communication. I never got a confirmation alert. After about 45 mins I called to place to confirm and the lady said my order was out for delivery. Too bad for the drive not having change I wasn't able to tip. I would order again.",

When we went on Saturday- we were the first customers in the joint.  They accommodated our party of 9 + a baby.  It's not a very large place.. We literally took up half of the restaurant.  Our waiter was very polite, as was the rest of the staff.  He made a lot of good suggestions, warned us about the heat levels.... and immediately took our order since we had some time to look at the menus .    I don't even remember what everyone else had.. but i remember what I had. ha!  I started with the malaysian roti because I love that stuff... and Pan Asian did not disappoint.   The yellow curry was creamy and full of flavor.    My entree: was MORE CURRY! Massaman, and I love it!    *What I do remember is my daughter ordering the vietnamese shrimp ravioli and marking the heat at 1-- and it was WAAAAAY to hot... even for the spice lovers at the table.    Next time we are ordering with 0 spice.  hahaha.. seriously.  If this place wasn't so far I'd be visiting as often as we visit our favorite local thai joint in our area.   But it's a definite must try.  there's plenty of different items to choose from... and if you have no idea, let them know what you're feeling and they'll definitely point you in the right direction!",

I can't say that I have been to any other Asian restaurant that consistently tastes as bright and fresh as the food prepared here. I love spicy food - but I have to say, this place knows how to add some heat. I can easily eat a level 9/10 at other establishments, but here, I can only tollerate levels 3 to 5 depending on the style of dish.   Top picks:  Crying Tiger Salad w/ Beef - I would order this at a lower heat level than you would traditionally order, since the acid in the salad amplifies the spice level.   DW Fried Rice - It's the best I've ever had - and if you're not adventurous, this is a great first dish for you.   Massaman or Red Curry - BOTH are perfection. The flavors are perfectly balanced, and if you like heat, add it here.  Drunken Noodles - I have yet to find a better pad kee mao in town. Delicious!  For dessert, you'll have to order the mango w/ sticky rice, or the fried bananas. Both dishes are only offered when the produce is perfectly ripe and in season. If it's not - they won't serve it!   David and his wife are absolutely wonderful, and always greet us when we come in.  Prices are right on point and the service is great!",

    "text": "Been here twice so far.  First visit: Came here for dinner and ordered the duck curry on a yelper's recommendation. Absolutely love the duck curry. To quote another yelper, \"The crispy duck curry is a savory thai curry shimmered with the sweet pineapple and grapes, sometimes with lycee to balance out the spiciness, while the duck are fried super crispy.\" This is one dish that I tried on that yelper's recommendation and it was superb. LOVE IT! Just be careful with regards to the spice level. If you can't take spicy, go mild. I think I had mine at level 6 or 7 and it was somewhat burning my mouth. And I generally have my food spicy. So you've been warned.  Ps. The duck curry is not on their menu. You have to ask for this dish specifically. Remember to check with the staff on the price. I remember I was a little shocked when I saw the bill.  Second visit: Decide to come here and try out their lunch specials. Ordered the beef noodle soup (pho) and omg, bad decision. As we know, the broth is the backbone of any kind of noodle soup and my beef noodle soup was literally drowned in salt. I could feel the sodium kicking into my system and it did not go well with me at all. Other than the sodium laden broth, I honestly cannot remember anything else about my dish. My friends who ordered other dishes (I can't recall what their orders were now) were also complaining about their food, although i can't quite remember what their complaints were. Overall, none of us enjoyed our lunch experience that afternoon.   Service was good, and that's probably why I gave this place a 3-star. After my second visit, I think I am just going to have to stick to only my duck curry from now on. That is how traumatized I've become after having that beef noodle soup.",

So far we have tried the roti, massaman curry, crying tiger salad, pork/fishball soup, beef noodle soup, and drunken noodles.  The massaman curry is a must for curry-lovers. It's on a whole other spectrum of curries. Sweet and spicy; the vegetables are super fresh.   The beef noodle soup, their version of pho, had a wonderful broth. It has an added flavor that we just couldn't put our finger on...  The beef salad was THE best we have ever had. Less salty and more tender than our usual thai orders.  The service is wonderful, David and Lisa are very hospitable and make you feel at home :)",

Pad Thai:  Good, not too greasy like other restaurants.  Massaman Curry:  I've never tried this type of curry before but as an Avocado fan, it was great to have avocado in my curry.  My mom normally doesn't like curry but she liked this one.  My favorite dish of the night.  Drunken Noodles:  I've never had drunken noodles before but this was pretty good too.

I decided to try them again this evening 5:30pm. With Thai coffee including $2.99 delivery and tips, total out $23.50. Boy! What a Horrible quality. It was night and day. There was no Passion put into the plate. But Please excuse my language, i'd end up having to spit out 60% of it out due to the undercook, tough meats. Completely being taken for my $$$.

If you head towards China town on Spring Mountain Road and keep driving for about ten minutes pass an abundance of Foot Spas you will arrive at Durango Dr. Turn right and you will see the restaurant right next to Storage One on the right hand side.  Now, when you get there, be prepared to be greeted warmly by Mr. David Wong himself, a friendly and genuine personality that made us feel right at home. The menu is simple yet has a lot of exciting varieties but after three incredibly satisfying visits, here are my top recommendations:  1) Mango or green papaya salad - oh so refreshing and delicious! 2) MUST HAVE red duck curry (It's off the menu and their top secret special!, Lisa Wong, the chef pours her heart into this dish!) 3) Yellow Malaysian tilapia curry. 4) Garlic sauce tofu 5) Basil chicken  The servings are generous, prices are reasonable and service is friendly and fast. What more could one ask for? Their ingredients are of superior quality and food presentation is of what you expect of a fine dining restaurant.   We had the tempura cheesecake and it was the the icing on the cake of our culinary experience. This is a MUST VISIT every time we come to Vegas! You will not be disappointed.",

I love their Shrimp Springrolls as they are filled with yummy shrimp and clear noodles. I love their curries and each order is prepared to order. I love that their curries have ingredients other Thai places don't like eggplant, Cabocha squash, sweet potatoes and avocado. They have brown rice as an option too. Their Pad See Ew was also very tasty and my friend ordered Boat Noodle Soup and it was very spicy and delicious! The family working there are always very nice. The only thing is the food takes patience cause it is a small kitchen with one wok and one stovetop. But good food is definitely worth the wait!",

David, the extremely patient and welcoming gentleman waited as we flipped back and forth with our menus, unsure of what to order. (I think David is the owner of this establishment, and if he is, he is doing a great job! He's so nice!!)   I ordered Pad Thai with Chicken and Shrimp to share with my boyfriend while my brother orders Basil... rice? Or something like that! We also ordered Calamari and a bowl of rice on the side because initially David told us that the Pad Thai came with rice but then he told us it actually did not, so we ordered rice to sort of absorb all the oils from the noodles. Everything, to me, seemed to be in large portions so it's a good thing I shared my Pad Thai because I still couldn't even finish my half! David gladly boxed the rest of my food up for me.  Overall, the food was great! (Although the Calamari did taste a little plain) Everything was delicious and also presented very nicely. The service was exactly how it should be AND bonus points for not even batting an eyelash at my service dog with me!-- right now, they have cute simple Halloween decorations in their restaurant and the staff in the kitchen seem to be in a very good mood :) the whole experience was so good that you can count on me coming back here!",

Flavor - perfect.   My entree - Filet Mignon Pho Soup (with medium spice). Comforting with a nice kick. While my soup was cooling off, I took the meat out and cut it into smaller pieces (just a personal preference).   I also ordered a Thai Coffee since it was a brunchy lunch for the hubby and I. Sweeter than I expected (which is not what I normally prefer) but offered balance to my somewhat spicy soup. It turned out to be a nice treat :)  Hub and I split the Pineapple Fried Rice (mild) with chicken & shrimp, which were the right texture, flavor and size.   His entree - Drunken Noodles - medium - with added chicken. Large portion with nice flavor & texture. I ate some of the veggies. Fresh and not over-cooked.   We wanted to give the Thai Donuts a try since it added to the brunchy feel. They could've been cooked a tiny bit longer but that'll just give us reason to them put them in the oven later since the entrees were so filling. We'll definitely have enough of everything for 2 more meals. The donuts didn't affect my rating for our overall experience.",

We ordered the roti, basil fried rice and drunken noodles --- all fabulous!  The owner, I believe, chatted us up at the tail end of our meal.

    "text": "Been here a few times, as they are very much in our neighborhood, and we've tried a few different dishes; classic thai fare, and pretty much all of their curries.  Their panang curry has pretty much set the standard for Curry I Crave. The chunks of vegetables are huge, and everything is perfectly cooked; no mushy potato but crunchy carrot. Everything's perfect. Caveat: I am a big fat wuss when it comes to spice, so while it might be too mild for some, it's just mild enough that I can sweat through it, but actually finish everything.  Great place for takeout, too, since they are very quick!  They are a little on the steep side for neighborhood asian food, but they are so high quality, and so unlikely to make my tummy upset, it's pretty much worth it.",

Food:  Massaman Curry...Wow! I'm not a curry fan.... but this one.... Yea Baby! Would never think that Avocado would go in a curry... but it was Great!  Pad See Ew... Could have continued eating this even after I exploded.... So Good!   Papaya Salad.... I tried my friend's dish... I have no idea what number of hot she ordered... but this had a nice kick.  It was cool and fresh and then BAM the spice sneaks up on you... but I went back for a couple more bites.    Hotness Rating:  I like a bit of spice/heat... but not too much... I actually like to taste the food I'm eating and not just hot spice.  So our Massaman Curry and Pad See Ew dishes were 1.... but I would have preferred to bump it up a step to 2.... but not too much more than that.... for me anyways.  They scale their dishes 1 to 10. My other friend ordered a 3 on a veggie stir fry dish... and she was visibly sweating and she was LOVING the food. I don't know if she sweats easy... but she really enjoyed it and said it was \"hot\" but that it was perfect... so my guess is their 3 is more like a 5 or 6 other places.  So, I can only assume that their 10 is off the charts.  Price: Very Reasonable.... about $10/pp for an entree and drink  Notes: Good Parking In a little strip mall Doesn't serve alcohol",

I do have to say it was sodium packed for my liking but my thai iced helped mellow out the saltiness. I'll have to come back to check out more of their dishes.",

I settled on a Garlic Pepper Check at a 4 so my wife could share and it was hotter then an 8 for Mint Chicken at Lotus.  It was however very tasty.  My Wife's new entree was chicken fried rice and it was also very good.  We will be back.  Larry",

When I opened the take out box, there are measly 9 pieces of thinly shredded chicken breast. The sauce was watery. The chicken tasted bland but spicy. Spicy hot was the only thing you can taste on the chicken meat. The food was nothing similar to the picture on yelp.  The curry was also bland and spicy. I like spicy food, don't get me wrong but spicy bland? Ewwww. The curry was also watery like as if it has been watered down. Isn't Panang curry supposed to be thick and rich? This is definitely the worst curry I have ever tasted.  I will advise everyone to stay away from this establishment. This is a waste of my money. I threw everything out after merely tasting it.  SAVE YOUR MONEY AND GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!!!",

I had the grilled thai shrimp mango salad and the chicken panang curry was the da bomb! The salad not often really high on any salad dish but this one for sure so hearty and full of flavors I could do salad every day in life. They use organic mixed greens (not common head lettuce or romaine or bland salad greens), the dressing is divine (If could steal that salad dressing; sign me up!), the tiger shrimp cooked perfection not dried out moist with nice grilled marks, the MANGO for me that the star of the dish so FRESH (Mango in most restaurants over ripe or under ripe) could eat Mango by itself, and combine everything together toss it together salad ecstasy. Truly appreciate about this salad it many components it has every EVERY part be like plate of Mango, plate of shrimp, etc. Amazing! I could get plate of each. The chicken panang was excellent too! I enjoyed everything but not only the sauce has nice depth too it besides nice little kick. The vegetables in it. Green beans nice fresh, and bell peppers nice crunch or al dente bite too them. Tien great recommendations on both dishes! So many more dishes without doubt be coming back for more.  The spice level at Pan Asian no joke. I have been too my share of thai restaurants there times that each place spice level never know what too expect if its truly 6 or above. Not that I mind because I enjoy spicy food. It nice change knowing that if want get some heat get it. I had the 3 on the grilled shrimp mango salad. The owner warned me not go above 3 or 4. Good call. I kind of sweating it out on the salad little bit. The chicken panang got 6 just right.   If want some good thai or pan asian food. No better place too go!",

It's probably the only Thai/Chinese/Japanese/Vietnamese/Malaysian place you're likely to find. If you can't find something to love here, McDonald's is right down the street.  Can't decide which particular Asian cuisine you desire? Well, Pan Asian has a little from here and there and it's all executed perfectly and...fine... I will say it ...\"kicked up a notch\". There are some little hooks in the dishes that show that someone in kitchen really cares about the food's history and heritage, yet wants to add a little nod to taking it even further.   I cannot wait very long before I go back for the red curry. There's something about pumpkin being included that just fascinates me. The avocado in my wife's massaman curry was out of this world. Once again, it's that little extra.   When have I had better fried rice? Never. (I'm not  a huge \"fried rice fan\", so it's not something on which I can have any sort of a baseline as I do with pork chile verde.) It was plenty for dinner and lunch the next day. I ordered it  spiced \"as the chef would make it\".   I am not Asian. I do not have to impress a cavewoman by eating blistering hot things and showing how manly her protector is.  The chef is a professional. This is kind of what she does for a living, so I trust her to add enough heat to complete the dish and not overpower the other flavors.  In this, she excelled. While it would have been too spicy for my wife, it was perfectly balanced.  Prices $4.95 for a bowl of Filet Mignon Pho. It's not the \"bigger than your head\" kind you'll get from the places on Spring Mountain, but you won't be wasting any of it, either. It was a great size to split for an appetizer.  The owner/waiter is the kind of friendly guy that just rocks as your host. Attentive, funny, and most importantly, genuine in every respect. It's not forced. You're in his house and he wants you to have a great meal. The chefs do, as well and you can tell they honestly appreciate the praise they so deserve.   Appetizers are $5 to $9. Entrees average about $10.  Some soups are $8. Most dishes are $10 and $12 for the ones with shrimp. Lunch specials are $7. (If only I had a job near this place!)  The table of six next to us all had amazing meals. We didn't see a single person that didn't thoroughly enjoy it there.   Now, go before everybody finds out about this place!",

I was surprised how many customers were there for such a remote location.  I was disappointed that the Lunch Specials were only Monday- Friday.  They offer 5 entrees for $6.95-8.95.  The owner's wife wearing a chef's jacket greeted me and handed me a paper menu.  She thought I wanted food to go, but I sat down.  They had glossy paper menus on the tables.  They serve Thai, Chinese, Japanese, and Vietnamese cuisine.  The owner took my order.  I wanted the Grilled Tiger Shrimp Mango Salad Thai Hot.  He suggested that I order it a \"6\".  I told him I wanted it a \"10 Thai Hot\".  It really was Thai Hot.  This was one of the few places I have found that makes Thai Hot.  There were 5 grilled tiger shrimp with the tails on a bed of mixed greens, julienned mango, red onions, bell peppers, whole cashew nuts, Asian herbs, with a chili lime dressing.  I will be back for lunch!",

I came he with my usual lunch crowd (we all work together) thus right off the bat we asked for separate checks and was told no problem. The special was volcano chicken so three of us ordered that and one ordered the yellow curry and the last ordered Chicken Pad Thai. Well the Volcano chicken was atrocious, it was sooooo overcooked I couldn't taste any chicken, I swear when I say it tasted like glazed pork rinds. My jaw hurt from crunching so much. Everyone that got the Volcano Chicken had the same issue. My friends Pad Thai came out pink?? And smelled and tasted like fish.. he took two bites and pushed it aside. When the check came they forgot to give us separate checks and a overcharge and refund later we finally got out of there.  Not sure if there was a new cook or the what, but this is one place that will not get a second chance from me, and I love Asian food.",

It was very good, but had a heavy peanut flavor more than others I've experienced. It was still delicious. The seafood soup - I ordered a 3 in\"hotness\", and I thought it was a bit hotter. Again, it was good, but I would recommend backing off on what I think was lime in it. I never had Thai tea.  That was a pleasant experience. Very tasty. You feel like you're amongst family at this quaint restaurant, and Jay (who served me) was honest, sweet, and took care of me. Be blessed....",

However, when I purchased won ton soup \"to go\" for lunch, I was disappointed in the quantity of won ton and portion of the soup.  I would of thought I would at least have more soup base, but didn't. It was very small bowl, and only FOUR won tons. For $5.95, that's pretty steep in cost for the over all portions size. Usually a tiny small bowl like that I have seen in other restaurants were between $2.95-$3.75.  The soup was good, but didn't enjoyed the experience as I was a bit annoyed on how much I paid for such as small portion.  It's not like it's a 5 star restaurant which I would expect it to be pricey.    The next time I want soup, I better off going to Chinatown or Panda Express.  Better value in my money and 3x as much soup and product.",

I ordered Calamari because it's my absolute favorite just about any restaurant I frequent. Ironically the calamari here was fried in cornmeal which was extremely odd and kind of hard to enjoy because the taste texture wasn't allowing me to do so. Not sure if I would order this item again.  Can't go wrong with some pot stickers and they were very filling and equally delicious.  The egg rolls were by far my favorite item ordered. Crisp, hot and so tasty!!!!!!!!!  I also ordered the Drunken Noodles with shrimp. The noodles were interesting looking but yummy and my belly didn't discriminate.  I'd definitely return and I sincerely appreciate the hospitality!!!",

They make it with white potatoes, sweet potatoes, peppers, and onions. I ordered it 5 spicy and that was pretty hot. I might go for 2 next time. The curry was good, but I still think Archie's yellow curry is the best around Vegas. The roti with yellow curry I did not care for. Actually, the curry was good. It was the bread that I didn't care for. They use a flaky bread that is deep fried. I am use to having baked bread with my roti. I'm sure it is good if you like fried bread, it's just not my thing.  I will definitely be back for the Pad Thai.",

Mom is the cook in the back, father is the owner/manager, and daughter waitress. I think that added to the whole experience. Service was outstanding here.  We aren't out this way very often and we wanted to try it all. So we ordered 7 dishes. The mom even came out because they thought we were food critics or something. No....we just love eating.  We ordered:  Shrimp Pad Thai - Good but too spicy  Chicken Pad Thai (ordered it less Spicy) - Bomb!  Chicken Pad See Ew - Bomb!  Panang Chicken Curry - good but too spicy  Combination Pineapple Fried Rice - Bomb  Garlic Pepper Chicken - Ok  Volcano Chicken - Bomb  Side note: Be careful when ordering here with the spice level. Normally at Thai restaurants I always get 5/10 for spice. A 5 here is like an 8/10.   Some of the best Thai dishes in Las Vegas! Definitely a must try for really good food and service.",

I always get the chicken or beef fried rice with an order of their amazing pho. I used to be scared to indulge in anything spicy but DW Pan Asian has kicked that fear out of me. I feel no shame in shoveling the food in my face with a full pitcher of water next to me as my sinuses drain and I sweat bullets. Prices are great and service is quick but not too quick to where you can't have a nice pre-meal conversation. I feel like its a well kept secret by locals and I want it to stay that way because thats what helps make it so great.",

    "text": "Pan Asian is probably my favorite all-around Thai restaurant in Las Vegas. The prices are reasonable for the quality of food produced. Although they don't quite have the selection as Lotus of Siam, they have all the classics. My personal favorite is the stir-fried linguini, which comes with your choice of meat, asparagus, tomatoes, and a spicy kick (there's no mild version). Other favorites like pad thai and pad see-yew are just as good. I love that the noodles are actually cooked to perfection instead of the typical half-assed versions that stick together at some other Thai joints. I also really enjoyed the DW fried rice if you're not feeling any of the noodle dishes. Their level of spiciness rates on a scale of 1-10 so if you're a first-timer, I highly recommend starting low (even a 3 is a bit too much for some people).   I've always had a great meal here. I've even catered through Pan Asian - they take large orders up to a day prior. They also have lunchtime specials on the weekdays.",

The wait staff was excellent and took the time to answer our questions and determine our spice level which was varied at the table. Their red curry with pumpkin and baby eggplant was delightful-- aromatic and the perfect blend of sweet and savory Everything was served beautifully. They even make their own ground pepper sprinkle, which adds more spice when you need it.  Lastly, we saw another table order fried ice cream and thus did the same. A dough filled with shaved coconut, not too sweet, deep fried, surrounding a creamy middle. What a way to go!",

The owners of Pan Asian are super sweet.  Chef Lisa has a great name, doesn't she?  I was the only one there, and I told them my friend Misti recommended them so highly that I drove from the other side of town!  Some things Chef Lisa and her husband said:  \"Misti sure has a lot of friends!\" \"Misti just ate here yesterday!\" ...and when I ordered the massaman curry with fried tofu, \"Misti prefers her massaman with steamed tofu.\"  So I smiled and giggled, and enjoyed that Misti is like the fabric of the restaurant (well, there are brick floors but you know what I mean).  The massaman was unlike any massaman I ever had.  I am used to thick, dark, and sweet coconut-milk based sauce.  This sauce was savory, almost buttery, and thin.  I am not sure how I feel about the butter instead of the coconut flavor.  However, it was CHOCK full of big chunks of veggies (potatoes, red peppers, green peppers, carrots, onions), crisp peanuts, ripe avocado, and then of course, the tofu.  The spice was right on.  I told them I was going to Thailand and Cambodia for my honeymoon and wanted to keep up with the heat.  My nose ran, always a good sign.  Lisa's husband told me he lived in Cambodia, and Lisa told me about her travels in Phuket.  The lunch special came with a canned drink, which I found out after I got Thai iced tea, so I ended up with 2 drinks.  However, I got my can of coke served with a straw, and for anyone who knows I drink soda through a straw, that is pretty cool.  I definitely want to come back and try other dishes.  The atmosphere is pretty and clean, the owners warm, the food spicy and tasty.  And even if Misti isn't physically there, she is definitely \"there\"!",

    "text": "Ding ding ding, we have a winner folks!  First of all, thanks to Misti and the crew for finding yet another gem.  This place advertises itself as an Asian fusion restaurant, but at its core it is a gourmet, mostly authentic Thai restaurant.  And you know how I love Thai food...  We ordered the Massaman Curry with beef, the Rad Nah with pork, and the Vietnamese Shrimp Ravioli.  After eating these, I am convinced that this is one of the top three Thai restaurants in Las Vegas, maybe top two!  (UPDATE: This is THE BEST Thai restaurant in Vegas currently).  The Vietnamese Shrimp Ravioli were quite interesting as an appetizer.  The presentation was very gourmet and beautiful.  The ravioli noodles were soft and sticky, wrapped in a shrimp that's cooked in interesting spices.  The flavor was perfect with a little bit of red chili sauce on it (I skipped the soy sauce that came with it).  Not Thai, I know, but definitely yummy.  I am not really a fan of Massaman because it tends to be sweet, but with all of the talk about it here, I thought I would try it.  This version was sweet, as it is supposed to be, but it also had a ridiculously intriguing and complex flavor!  There was a definite peanut flavor, but also another flavor that I couldn't put my finger on.  The chef makes her own curries, so I attribute this complex flavor to the homemade curry sauce.  I probably would order this with less sweetness next time, but this dish was amazing.  It came with big potato slices, carrots cooked to perfection, bell peppers, and beef chunks that were nicely prepared.    The Rad Nah here is extremely good, and won me over.  This is probably tied for the second best Rad Nah I have had!  The cook said that it was one of her favorite dishes, and so she takes a lot of pride in her recipe.  This dish smelled absolutely amazing.  Smokey, lightly sweet aromas.  The taste was just as good.  The pork was nice and juicy, and the Chinese broccoli was fresh and crunchy.  The sauce was slightly more rich than the other two great Rad Nah recipes I have had, which gave it its own character.  Not a lot of places can make a great Rad Nah, and Pan Asian makes one of the best I have had.  Great job, Pan Asian.  I am so glad to have this restaurant available in Las Vegas.  I will have to take some breaks from my usual spots to explore their menu some more.  The Thai food is mostly authentic, but they do have to Americanize certain dishes a little bit.  So, if you want the real deal, just order it \"Thai style\".  We rattled off a few exotic dishes that we like, and the chef said that some of them she can cook very well (very spicy Pa Cha).  I can't wait to go back!  Edit: I've been back a number of times and have loved every dish I have had (roast duck, red snapper).  One dish really stood out yesterday though, the red curry.  I had it with beef, spicy level 10, and it came with fresh peppers and pieces of pumpkin!  It wasn't as sweet as the other curries, so you non-sweet curry lovers will enjoy this one!  The sauce is homemade, and full of fresh flavors.  I believe that it may be the best red curry I have ever had.  Dave said that this is how the royal family eats red curry.  I don't know about royalty, but if this dish isn't fit for it than I don't know what is!  Second Edit: recommended dishes for Thai food lovers, may not be on the menu: the Red Curry dishes (served with fresh pumpkin!), Pa Cha with tilapia, Red Snapper, Duck curry, fried banana.",

We were served water but not offered any other beverages. Unless you know the owner/chef, your order will be prepared last as was the case tonight as two individuals who arrived and ordered after us were served rapidly. A mediocre wonton soup and adequate fried rice took over 15 minutes to prepare in a nearly empty restaurant. The mushy small portion of Pad Thai arrived several minutes after the rice and soup although ordered at the same time. There's just too many other Asian restaurants in the area to justify tolerating this type of meal/service. Instead I would recommend Thai Noodle House or Oasis Kitchen (Buffalo and Flamingo) it is not surprising that at 730pm on a Saturday night, this restaurant was nearly empty.",

So here are my theories on why the food is so good or how it was made:  - The Restaurant is actually a wormhole or gateway to a parallel universe where food is always that good. If this is the case i want to journey to this parallel universe and never leave.  - Chef Lisa is a robot or an android or a cybernetic being sent from the future to help us fight against crappy food. This would explain how she got three orders to come out all at the same time without aid  - Chef Lisa is a wizard, she conjures up food using magic, wizardry, spells. This would explain the fast service and magical taste of the food.  - Chef Lisa is an alien that uses advanced technology to create food that will blow us away.  If this is the case then her intentions are not clear but may include but are not limited to  + studying our social habits  + fattening us up for invasion/dinner  + observing mating rituals  + set us upon one another and destroy the very fabric of society in search of that oh so good bowl of noodles  The food can only be described as 'supernatural'. Regardless of how and why it came to be i will willfully and happily return again and again.",

    "text": "What a nice surprise. This place must be a best kept secret because it has been in business since 2011 and this is the first my wife and I have heard about it. Fortunately, someone recommended this business to us for good Thai food and we were not disappointed. The Basil Fried Rice ($10.95) came highly recommended as well. The recommendation was on point. The basil added a really nice flavor profile to what is typically a plebeian entree in most venues. Also, I ordered an appetizer of Malaysian Roti ($6.95). Let me start by stating that I had no idea what Malaysian Roti was. I sometimes like to roll the dice by ordering a dish or entree \"in the blind\" so to speak. It goes without saying that this can go one of two ways, but hey, this is Vegas baby. I was surprised in a good way. It came with what I would describe as flat, sweet pastries with a small side dish of yellow curry, potato and basil. I could have consumed a bowl of the yellow curry that came with this appetizer. This was more like dessert to me and I probably would not order this again. However, I am definitely going to focus on one of their yellow curry dishes on my next visit. My wife and I shared two entrees. I ordered a stir fry of Cashew Nuts with Pork ($9.95) and she ordered a special of Pan Sear Salmon with Mango Sauce ($21.95). We were informed upon ordering that their food comes very spicy/hot. So that a 4 or 5 elsewhere is typically a 2 or 3 here. Believe it. Where I might go a 4 somewhere else I would not go higher than a 2 here. Both dishes were very good. Bottom line, I am looking forward to returning and trying new items on their menu.",

    "text": "OMG, I don't even know where to start. But this place is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!!!! This place is a hidden gold mine, but I have found it :D Pan Asian has been bearly open for a month, but I can see a bright future ahead of them.   Wherever  the cook came from, she is a GOD. All the orders are made FRESH to order, you can see her make all the food from scratch, and uses only the freshest ingredients. I had the Tiger Shrimp Mango salad and I have never been more in love with a salad EVER. The pineapple fried rice was also super mega delicious. Good thing is that everything is perfectly proportioned, so you won't end up with an entree that only has a two pieces of meat or whatever. They definitely don't take a cheap shortcut.  Restaurant is obviously new and very clean, the kitchen is balling and huge (the kitchen itself is bigger than the dining area). Menu is very clean and easy to read. Prices are a bit high but reasonable since they use fresh ingredients, cooked to order, and just taste damn good. You do get what you pay for, and every penny is worth it here!  Pan Asian where have you been all my life, I would totally ask the cook to adopt me so I can eat her cooking everyday. This place is a MUST try. I will definitely be back here many, many times.  5 STARS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

The place is small and has shiny red booth seats that looked like they were bought at an auction from a 50's diner.  The kitchen is wide open so because of this you can see everything that the cook is doing. We ordered fried gyoza for my extra picky daughter,red curry with chicken (minus the eggplant-alergic), beef pad sew ew, & Basil Fried rice.  I'm craving the Basil fried rice as I write this review. I loved that dish-The BF and I were just discussing how we love it when a dish is ordered and is seasoned well - so well that we don't have to add a condiment to the dish. Basil Fried Rice=Yumminess!!!! The Red curry was ok - the veggies in the curry were not to our liking. The owner guy (I'm guessing) noticed that we didn't eat all our pumpkin. We told him that we prefer potatoes and carrots. He said because they make  every dish fresh we can ask for them to put whatever veggies we want in our curry. I really liked hearing that-very cool!!!! The Pad See Ew was yummy as usual. The goyza was standard - I wasn't excited about this but this was all my picky child ate - so it served it's purpose.  This place is very out of the way for us but I'm gonna have to get me some Basil fried rice soon....",

I asked my cousin and he suggested Pan Asian.   Looking at the menu, everything listed looked so appetizing.  I wanted to try them all.  My budget for that day for lunch wasn't more than $6 so I ordered Tom Kha soup made with coconut, chicken, some different herbs I've never seen or tasted before, lemon grass, and amongst other things.    It was the exact kind of goodness I just needed on a cold windy day.  The sour taste was just perfect and not overpowering the whole dish.  Everything together was combined well.  The service was also comforting as the employees all were very patient, and easy to talk to.  It's also great to be able to speak with the chef.  It's rare that chefs talk to their patrons anymore.  It definitely was a nice change.  I am curious about their penang curry and the other curries they're serving.",

Hint:  It's listed on the website under David Wong's Pan Asian, not just Pan Asian.  The delivered food has been just as tasty as the items I've had in the restaurant.  And the food keeps really well.  Right now, I'm having some of the basil fried rice and grilled octopus salad for breakfast from the night before. :)  They may be running out of proper to go containers because occasionally I get rice in a strange container (making me think upon first inspection that they forgot the rice) or the liquidy curry in a standard foam hinged carryout wrapped in a plastic bag. They usually pack it in a soup container. But it's all good because the delivery folks are pretty careful with it.  More careful than I would be.    Food is still great, but now there is delivery if you are willing to pay the delivery service charge for the third party delivery service.",

Had mostly done take out in previous ventures there so decided to have a nice sit down meal which allowed me to explore some of their off the menu specials.   Had an incredible Tilapia Red Curry which was worth the $10.95 and then some.  The spice levels still throw me off a little.   I didn't even throw out a number and simply said \"medium\" and was still clamoring for refills every few minutes.   That's by no means a complaint, but just a warning to anyone ordering for the first time (even though it's been emphasized several times already throughout the other reviews...)  Also, I'm currently obsessed with Iced Tea but avoid Thai Tea due to the dairy elements.   I mentioned this to David and he got me a regular Tea (which is not listed on the menu).   Since the Thai Tea is presumably made from the regular tea + \"other stuff\", it's not like this was some crazy special order, but for those who share my iced tea obsession, it might be useful to know.",

    "text": "Pan Asian is an excellent family owned and operated Asian fusion restaurant.  If you come at night, the first thing you will probably notice when you walk in is the harsh and very bright fluorescent lighting over the dining area. Like space ship bright. It would be so much nicer if they dimmed or completely changed the lighting. For lunch it's not really an issue.  The atmosphere here leaves a lot to be desired. Thankfully the service and food make up for it.   The service is excellent, waitstaff are super friendly and attentive. They are more than happy to answer any questions about the menu, suggest dishes, and honor special requests. The service is an easy 5-stars.  The food is really good. Here are my favorite dishes:  Mango and Tiger Prawn Salad 5/5 This is a very well balanced combination of flavors. It's sweet, salty, tangy, and savory. The greens and herbs were crisp and fresh, the shrimp grilled to perfection.   Red Curry with Crispy Duck 5/5 This dish is phenomenal. It's not currently on the menu but it's almost always offered as a special. This is the signature dish here and you should not hesitate to order it. It's a little expensive compared to the rest of their menu, but you get a huge duck breast that is easily shared by two people. The duck breast is dredged in flour and deep fried to crispy perfection. Okay, fried duck breast and red curry sounds too rich, but they way the curry is done balances this dish perfectly. The red curry sauce is light, almost watery, and along with the usual vegetables it also has pineapple chunks and fresh grapes. It works perfectly with the rich fried duck breast. Very clever and highly recommended.  Green Papaya Salad 5/5 This salad is awesome, but be careful about the spice level. Even if you order it mild, it's still very spicy. The papaya is cut shoe-string style and comes with a fish sauce dressing that is delicious.  The pineapple fried rice was pretty good but not great. It has a lot of flavor but it's extremely salty.   Overall, the food and service here are top notch. Ingredients are fresh and flavors are bold yet well balanced. The lighting and atmosphere hold this place back. It's not the kind of setting you want to be in for a romantic dinner and you would not bring a date or business client here if you want to impress them with a nice ambiance. Thankfully you'll forget about these shortcomings when you dig into the food, because it's delicious.",

    "text": "Pan Asian. Which means go spicy or go home!  Me and the wifey wanted to try this place out finally after driving by it so many times. The one time I actually stopped by to try them was when they went on vacation for almost 2 months. I guess everybody deserves some time off especially if you have your own restaurant.   After looking over the menu I decided to go with the Chicken in Spicy Garlic Sauce. The wifey was not all that hungry so she went with the Spicy Tom Yum Soup. Now back to my very first statement. Our server asked us how spicy we wanted the soup. He said choose from 1 to 3. Now from what I remember skimming on some of the reviews, their spiciness is hotter than the norm. So when my wife wanted 3 I politely interrupted her and said to go for a 1. Im glad we did because after tasting the soup, (which was awesome btw) my lips were burning. Combine that with the Chicken in Garlic sauce, wow! That in itself was spicy. Im glad my dish came with a bowl of white steamed rice because if it didn't, I would literally have steam coming from my head!  Now im assuming not all they have on their menu is burn a hole in your stomach spicy but once I was done with my meal, my clothes were all soggy with sweat, like I just came from the gym. Now if I can actually lose weight while eating here, then I am set! Who said multi tasking was hard?  As for service, we got our order pretty quick. But then again there were only two other tables being served. So next time the real test is when they are packed. Which means more trips to try other awesome food on their menu!  The only thing I thought that stuck out were the prices. We only ordered two items, but with tax and tip it was about 21 bucks. I think that's why lunch time is a hit here with the lunch specials.  Im kind of glad it was spicy because I probably would have ordered more food. Needless to say, we left satisfied.",

And it is more a service-based one rather than one centered on the quality of the food.  Tonight, I ordered the boat noodles. As any boat noodle lover knows, the crispy pork skin is essential to the experience. It adds a sharp, textured contrast to the richness of the meat and the broth.   I received my order to find the crispy pork skin missing. I inquired with the staff. Water, meet duck. They laughed it off stating that their supply was exhausted and they'd just give me \"a little bit more\" next time. What good does that do me, silly Pan? No explanation was given for why it wasn't brought to my attention when I initially placed my order.  For those who don't frequent Pan Asian, this was not a kitchen error left un-communicated to the front side of the restaurant. The cook is the owner and his wife interfaces between the front and the back, with another family member serving the tables.  Truly wouldn't have been an issue if they'd apologized right off the bat for a simple oversight. Instead, they dismissed it as a trivial matter and behaved as if they'd hoped I wouldn't notice the missing ingredient and ended up with their hands caught in the cookie jar. A disappointingly unprofessional experience all the way around.   Pan Asian, I will miss your boat noodles, but time will bring us closure and soon you will be a distant memory of a good thing that was, but no longer is. Mistakes have been made, but you will learn and grow. It's a shame, really, but I wish you well.",

We ordered Pad Thai woon sen, which has less calories than regular noodles. Yen Tha Fo is a sour soup dish (didn't expect this dish to be really sour) and basil chicken is a perfect with rice.   I would rate 12 out of 10 for the pad thai. It was very delicious.   Definitely will go back again when we are in town!",

We tried the Pad Thai and Pork ribs w/ XO sauce. Both were delicious. I love how spicy the pad Thai was and I only had a level 3. My only complaint was that the noodles were kinda stuck together.   The pork ribs were wonderful and savory! The ribs were slightly crispy on the outside and nicely tender on the outside.   David Wong himself served us and he was very nice and funny!  I really enjoyed it here and can't wait to come back and try their pho!",

We got roti, chicken pad thai, drunken noodles and beef panang.  The roti was nice and hot - fluffy and a bit sweet...perfect for dipping in curry.  The pad thai was redder than most places' version but equally as good.  The beef panang was also great - lots of veggies and the curry was tasty.  Then there was the drunken noodles which Shawn got at spicy #10 - now,  I don't like spicy food but it was good and I liked it a lot.  I just had to wash it down with lots of Thai iced tea!  My nose was running because of it.  I'd order the drunken noodles again but at spicy #5.  The service was also great.  Very attentive and always with a smile.  The place is clean.  Overall, the food was good and I was not disappointed especially with the prices being low.  Great food, great value!",

As a starter we ordered the Gyoza, it was good, crispy on the outside and soft and delicious on the inside.   For my main meal I ordered the linguini noodles with chicken, my palate is very sensitive so on the scale of 1 to 10 of spiciness I ordered a 2. Let's just say I'm ordering a 1 next time. The noodles were amazing though, they were packed with a lot of flavor and a great amount of kick, my nose was running like niagara falls the entire meal. I'm not sure what noodles my husband ordered but he did order the noodles a level 8, he said he liked them as well but was expecting the noodles to be spicier, he's going with a level 10 next time.   For dessert we ordered the deep fried cheesecake, it's like a slice of Heaven in your mouth, its so rich and creamy and it's served with whipped cream and ice cream.   Overall we loved our entire meal, and the staff was extremely friendly! Plus it's inexpensive, for an appetizer, two entrees, two drinks, and dessert, we only spent $38. I highly recommend Pan Asian, I can't wait to come again and try more of their dishes.",

    "text": "Thursday night and my sisters and I were looking for a place to eat.  We were thinking somewhere different yet worth it.  I didn't want to go too far and i didn't want to spend a ton of money either so I suggested Pan Asian.  I had been there before, but my sisters had yet to experience this fabulous little restaurant.       We got there about 7 and were the only ones in the restaurant.  We were immediately greeted by the owner.  He told us the specials, a whole red snapper deep fried and served with a sweet chili sauce, and crispy duck served similar to Peking style.  While looking at the paper menu, I couldn't help thinking that the specials sounded amazing.  So we ordered the green papaya salad, the red snapper, and the crispy duck.       We ordered the green papaya salad with a spicy scale of 3, but when I tasted it, it seemed spicier.  It was really good, with great flavor and a nice crunch, but we couldn't get pass the spiciness.  Chef Lisa apologized and said she used a fresh chili and could see that it was spicier than normal.  She said she would tone it down a bit for the red snapper.    The red snapper came out and looked beautiful.  It was sitting upright on a plate with lots of veggies and a nice sweet chili sauce.  I normally do not eat fish, but the snapper was cooked perfectly and the sauce complimented it so well.  I couldn't help but have some.  We ended up eating the whole thing.      I love duck and was not disappointed with Chef Lisa's crispy duck.  The crispy duck was served with flour tortillas and 3 different sauces: mango, hoisin, and curry.  Along with the several pieces of crispy duck was crispy duck sauteed with bok choy in a black bean type sauce.  The duck was crispy on the outside and so tender and moist on the inside.  It had a great anise/five spice flavor that is common in duck.  All of the sauces were great with the duck and I thought the tortillas were a nice change from the buns you normally get with Peking duck.  The sauteed crispy duck with the bok choy was equally amazing with lots of flavor.  If this was on the menu by itself, it would be worth ordering as well.    The bill came out to where I expected it to be.  The food was well worth the price.  It was gourmet, but in a place where I wasn't afraid to use my hands with the duck or the fish.  I will definitely go back to Pan Asian and I'm looking forward to trying other things on their menu as well as any other specials that they may have.",

After placing my order the server was sent back to confirm I really wanted egg in the dish. This level of detail is what makes this place wonderful. My favorite dish here is the drunken noodles which I feel is better than any other Thai restaurant in Vegas. The curries are nice too. This place is very vegetarian friendly as well.",

The waiter/owner (I think) was so friendly and enthusiastic and helpful. He had every reason to be: the food was great!   I had their version of Pho, which was indeed good, just not what I was expecting. Very garlicky and flavorful. I ended up trading with my boyfriend because he loves garlic, and his dinner had a ton of fresh veggies and a light spicy sauce. I can't remember what he ordered, but it was very good and I ate every last bite!   We also had the chicken ravioli, which was different but still delicious.It came with a lot of sauces, and the owner gave us a guided tour of them--\"This one is very spicy, but this one is best with this dish.\"  The portion was a good size, too.   We had a coupon from one of these websites, like $10 for $20 (boy, I'm not very helpful, am I?), so the price we paid was excellent. My bf and I were both happy customers and assured the owner we'll be back.",

I mean, it's tasty and flavorful and my taste buds are overjoyed just thinking about last nights meal. I had the stir fry lingiune with shrimp. WOW. The thai basil is so good. I mean it, it is soooo good. I know she uses it in the Thai mango salad too. It tastes like regular basil, no worries that it would be weird, but WOW. It takes the dish from amazing to in my opinion exceptional. I've tried quite a few items on the menu. The fried tofu is good and I am NOT a fan of tofu. Weird, a vegetarian (95%, I went to Seattle and haven't been able to go cold turkey on fish since) who doesnt like tofu. The roti is so good. I've had roti before, but not like this. The curry sauce accompanying the roti is delicious. I wish I knew better words for delicious. Pan Asian is the place that allowed me to try the curry couscous at DW Bistro. If not for her yellow curry, I would be denying myself something wonderful. I can not say enough good things about this place. It's clean and bright, HUGE plus! The service is great. Always make sure you have drinks and always see how everything is. What more could you ask for. If you want great Asian food, THIS is the place to go.",

For appetizers, we had the Crispy Shrimp Spring Rolls and the Coconut Shrimp. Both were very good. The Coconut Shrimp was served with a dipping sauce that was truly amazing.  For the main entrees, I had the Grilled Tiger Shrimp Mango salad. The salad was perfectly prepared, all of the ingredients were fresh, and the shrimp was wonderful. The salad was light, but filling and full of flavor. We also ordered the Thai Chicken Spicy Salad, Pad Thai, and David Wong's Fried rice, all of which were fantastic.   Great food and service once again!  ***********************************************************************************************  After a few days visiting in Vegas, I was craving Asian food, found this place on Yelp and gave it a try. We were a little hesitant when we arrived because the place was empty, 0 customers (it was around 6pm on a Saturday). We gave it a try anyway and it was definitely the right choice. It's a small clean place, nothing fancy. It is very open so you can see the food being made as you wait. Let me tell you, the food here is awesome. Authentic, made to order, and full of flavor.   We had the calamari for an appetizer. It was great, cooked perfectly and very tasty. I was in the mood to try something different so I had the Massaman Curry (avocado, sweet potatoes, onions, and coconut milk and curry) with chicken added. It was packed with flavor and aromas. A great balance of flavors and I would definitely order it again. The family enjoyed the sweet and sour chicken (my hubby said it was good, not the traditional deep fried version), the fried rice (shrimp added), daughter loved it, and the pad thai (it was great as well). You get to choose the level of spiciness for all entrees. My son ordered the pad thai with the highest spice level and it was HOT!!!. We had the fried ice cream for dessert and it was super.  The owner was extremely nice and added a personal touch to the experience.  I will visit this place for sure again.",

The family operates this company are so genuine. They are so pleasant and treat you like family. Presentation of the food is done very well. If you dine in the restaurant and Mr Wong asks how was everything you hear the satisfaction in customers when they say if was amazing food. It truly is a great restaurant all around.

For starters, we ordered the Tom Khar soup and Vietnamese dumplings.  The soup was amazing with a perfect blend of coconut, lime, lemongrass, fresh ginger, and other magical ingredients.  I don't normally like soup, but this soup was addictive.  The dumplings were very good - I liked the fried garlic on top.  As we were eating, the owner/chef stopped by our table to see how the food, which was a kind gesture.  For dinner, we had the beef massaman curry and I had shrimp pad thai.  The pad thai came with a good amount of shrimp.  The noodles were more red in color than I have ever seen, but that didn't matter because it was unbelievably tasty.  The massaman curry had a nice blend or coconut, curry, and vegetables.  The beef was tender and flavorful from the sauce.  I really wanted dessert because the options were enticing, but I had other dessert plans.  The service was good and overall it was a great experience.  Can't wait to come back.",

    "text": "UPDATE: I really do wish this place had warm yellow light, some piped in music (the 1 TV is muted), something to break the stark black and quiet.  But the owner compensates with his sincere and humorous service.  This time we tried the pork spare ribs with XO sauce.  It was very good and man, the bok choy veggies at the bottom were EXCELLENT!  I would eat this over Brussels sprouts any time!  The cheesecake tempura my husband adored as is.  Personally I would like it without the coating.  It's a good cheesecake, and goes well a la mode.  I was quite disappointed with the pad thai though. I remember it to be a lot... yummier.  Dunno what happened.  I've had better around Vegas. -------- The place is quite small and bare, wish it had a little more warmth (maybe they should change the white lighting)...but the food rocks, and is presented beautifully.  The best phad Thai I've had in Vegas so far.  The owner is a sweetheart.",

The food is consistently delicious and fresh every time. I rotate between the sweet and sour chicken or the garlic pepper chicken and veggie fried rice. Be warned of the spice rating here, a level 10 is REALLY hot. My brother who is a spice fanatic has actually requested a level 20 dish which Dave accommodated! I don't know how he ate it but he ate the whole thing. Everything I have tried has been tasty here, from the gzoya, the Malaysian curry, to the chicken satay. Yum!",

    "text": "Oh Pan-Asian I wasn't sure what to take from you. The first app (Vietmanese Chicken Ravioli) we ordered was really, I mean really bland. Not even the hot sauce could redeem it. Great concept but no flavor whatsoever.   The Tiger Shrimp Mango Salad was incredible until I ate a piece of Shrimp. I personally didn't like the grilled taste because the charred pieces really throw off the rest of the salad. If the shrimp was sauteed, man oh man I would order this all the time. It's a perfect blend of sweet and sour. Now I love Basil fried rice and this comes to a close second for best Basil fried rice (Archi's). The yellow curry was surprisingly good as well.   I only saw a couple issues with this place. 1) if you come with more than 3 people you have to sit next to the door. The day we went, we had to sit next to the door. No bueno. 2) Their spicy rating scale is scaled way down. Ordered 8 & 9 but tasted like a 2 or 3 to me. I had even toned it down for the people accompanying me to dinner, normally I do a 10 plus add more hot sauce.   The owner is awesome and it's fun watching the chef do her thing. We did the Yelp deal and um we spent more than we thought. Dang deals make you think you're getting a deal then you order a number of dishes to later realize that the deal True only buys 2 entrees :(",

The restaurant isn't fancy, and I've never seen the restaurant close to full except during lunch time, but it is clean, and the food is tasty and plentiful.  It's located in a strip mall, and the parking can get a little strange at time (you have to experience it to understand).  Pan Asian competes with \"Archie's\" Thai restaurant which is about a mile away.  Pan Asian's Pad Thai, is much tastier than Archies, being sweet, spicy, and savory.  However Archies curry has a far greater depth of flavor than Pan Asian.    The one thing that sets Pan Asian apart is the feeling of personal service.  You can feel that they care about you as a customer and work hard for your repeat business, making you want to support this local restaurant.    Due to the low volume of business that I have observed, I would be surprised if this restaurant survives.  However, do yourself a favor and visit the restaurant.  The menu spans Thai with a flare of Viet Nam.  Ask the owner for his recommendation, you might be introduced to a foodie treat that you've never experienced.",

My husband is a fan of the DW(david wong) fried rice and the Red Nah Noodles.(I am too)   If you like coconut shrimp you got to have theirs. As for a soup, I recommend the filet mignon \"PHO\".  While their pad thai is as good as any ones I've tasted, I much perfer to experiment and order other things on their menu.  Desserts, I hear they are good but I never have room.  Bon Appetite",

Husband takes the orders while his wife works her magic in the kitchen. It is a bit of a drive (15 min) from the strip, but well worth the trip if you are in the mood for some Thai food.

Then we started on the basil fried rice tons of flavor and a touch of spiciness.    The second time we came in they recognized us even for pick up both times that means something to me in a restaurant.  This time we got sweet and sour pork, tomatoes were in this sauce and no deep fried nuggets here either.  The flavors were balanced very well my only complaint is I like a thicker sauce.  Also tried the pineapple fried rice, yeah I'm a fried rice junky.  This was one of the best I've had a little touch of curry a little sweet good stuff",

I found Pan Asian on yelp with exceptional reviews but going in skeptical since I come from San Francisco with just \"so so\" thai restaurants. I was proven wrong and highly impressed with the quality of food that we ordered starting with the roti! Mmm mmm!!! Baked nice and flakey with a curry sauce that was just right. On the special was fried red snapper and volcano chicken that was fried to perfection and lightly sauced with exciting flavors. My dad had the salmon which was prepared in a just right where it wasn't raw and not dried. Ambience was casual which was nice because you can dress relaxed eating gourmet style thai food. Lastly, I must commend the great service the staff provided. Waitress was very friendly and attentive, while the owner and his wife were the best hosts you could ever meet! If you're not from here or if you haven't been here yet, make this your first stop for family style cusine eating with a warm hospitable attitude that every great restaurant should have!",

The waitress just said sorry but did not take half off the bill since I ate the fried duck on top .... all she said is I told them... The Red curry had a very strange taste as I tasted a bit before I noticed the pineapple ..luckily I had some pills on me... I must say that the sate and the DW fried rice and the PadThai was awesome.",

    "text": "How many times you all think we can get a unicorn to high five a T-rex in outter space???  Let's make it happen!  I've had the opportunity to use Yelp's Eat 24 a few times.  Mainly for pick up orders.    But this time with Pan Asian I requested delivery.  My worry wart brain activated and wondered how hot my food would still hopefully be by the time it got delivered.  Especially cuz I'm in a gated complex where people sometimes wait to get in the gate.  Twiddled thumbs...  Food was delivered within 25 minutes of ordering which is not bad considering cooking time and a little over 2 miles away for delivery.  I expected such quality.  I can't assume a 4.5 star standing rating was only for dining in.  But because of the following, I'm really happy with: - they have pumpkin curry - rice is included with the dish ordered - food is delicious - they're close by - pricing is comparable in average to local Thai  - they have Yelp Eat 24 DELIVERY which arrived with edible hot delicious food  How good was it still?  The fried noodle stuffed egg rolls were crispy.  That's how good.  Pumpkin curry so yum.  I think I can handle medium spice next time.  The rice however had some hard pieces - the kind that stuck to my molars.  It's a 4.75****/  I'll try to dine in next meal, when I have more time.",

I came here last weekend, and I was quite disappointed. In short, average service and way over seasoned food.   1. Red curry with beef. The flavor of the eggplants and pumpkins were fine. However, the beef was soooo tough. It was NOT Edible! It seemed like it was cross-rib roast or some part of meat that's meant for slow cooked. We left all the beef in the plates, and yet the waitress didn't care to notice.  2. Chicken satay. The quality of the meat or the way they cooked it was questionable. Instead of tender, the meat was chewy.   3. Basil fried rice. It was way over seasoned that it was too salty to eat and the rice was too saucy. You can't taste the right texture of the rice.   4. Tom kha gai. I did not enjoy the soup either. It was salty but not seasoned properly for tom kha.   The only dish that I was able to eat was pad kee Mao, and that was a bit over seasoned as well. I will probably not return anytime soon.",

Most of the items on the menu are Thai but I see that they also have some Chinese , Japanese and Vietnamese options available.  I have enjoyed everything that I've tried so far , especially their chicken satay and Massaman curry. I really like flat noodles so you can never go wrong with their pad see ewe or drunken noodles (aka pad kee mao) for entrees. We have also tried their red curry w/ duck (one of their daily specials). Their red curry has eggplant and pumpkin in it ! I'm used to just having bell pepper and bamboo in my red curries but eggplant and pumpkin made the dish so much better. The duck was a bit more on the dry side but I think it complimented the curry.   Their spice level is from 1-10 and it's very accurate. A \"5\" is definitely mild and \"10\" must be insanely spicy since we ordered an \"8\" on our second visit and it was super spicy that we were sweating. It was a good kind of spicy though but I think if I got a \"10\" I would probably cry LOL.   Seating is alright , feels like a spot between a sit down restaurant and fast food place. I like that they maintain this place pretty clean though and they have an open kitchen. Overall , this is a great place to choose for lunch or take-out for dinner ! Don't skip on the Thai tea :9",

Our party of 3 (2 adults and 1 toddler) went on a Monday night and it was not packed (if you have a toddler, you know a quiet and chill restaurant is the BEST environment).  We ordered 3 dishes and asked for a rush on the DW Fried Rice to keep the toddler calm and they were happy to accommodate. The DW fried rice was delicious, my toddler was dancing after every scoop, so you know it's GOOD!  We were recommended the Garlic Pepper chicken and i would have to say that i am glad that we tried it.  At first glance it looked like it would lack flavor because the chicken sat on top of what looked like steamed vegetables.  The garlic pepper chicken packed SO much flavor that it worked well with the vegetables.    Overall, the service and food was fantastic! This might be our NEW go to Thai place!",

It does have some interesting dishes like the Malaysian roti.  Crispy on the outside, soft and doughy on the inside, it is hard to beat dipping an Indian based bread into a Malaysian (like a Thai based) yellow curry.  I then moved on to the Pad See-Yew with shrimp which was really good and like many of the dishes you can pick which protein you want (tofu, chicken, beef, pork, shrimp or fish).  I like flavor more than spicy so I enjoyed both dishes.  Wash it down with a Thai iced tea.  What I liked about this place is it can cater to both spicy and non spicy personalities.  This would be a good option if someone was vegetarian or pescatarian (not sure about vegan). The staff were friendly and can guide you to a dish if you are not sure of what you may like.  No military discount. Prices are not cheap but fair for the quality and amount of food you get. Conclusion:  All these delicious carbs put me in a food coma.",

The kitchen is \"open concept\" so you can see the entire cooking operation (once your seated though it's not as visible).  I rarely turn down a squid dish so I had to try the Fried Calamari. Its lightly breaded, or worded another way, it was very airy and crunchy. I prefer to have the squid more obvious but I understand the aversion many people have to squid so I guess I can understand the prominent breading. The chili dipping sauce tasted great and worked very nicely with the squid/breading.  The Singapore Noodles used very thin noodles, which was the primary ingredient. I ordered this dish because it contained bean sprouts, a food I also like, but there were very few sprouts even though its the first listed ingredient in the dish. The mushrooms, carrots, and bok chop were all very fresh and add body and flavor to the dish. This dish can be ordered with a spice level of 1-to-5, I went with 2, and at that level there was a nice subtle taste of chili spice. Also, six different meats/seafood can be ordered, I went with chicken, which came out fine.  The restaurant is clean and the food preparation is prompt. Well worth considering for a future visit.",

    "text": "Tucked away in a tiny shopping plaza on South Durango Drive it is likely that many have driven past David Wong's Pan Asian dozens of times without even noticing the Restaurant is there, and yet in reality the kitchen has been serving the West Side of Las Vegas for over six years while also amassing a fairly large number of Chefs and industry folks who consider it a part of their regular dining rotation.  A Husband and Wife operation, he the business end while she does the cooking, it was as part of a group of nine including two children that several smaller tables were combined to form one large space on Saturday night just past 7:00pm, the arrangement accounting for more than half of Pan Asian's Covers on this particular night though at least three-fold as many came and went over the course of ninety minutes with call-in or online orders.  Called Pan Asian based on an embrace of several styles of cooking ranging from Vietnamese to Malaysian to Thai, the menu having undergone many changes over the years based on old pictures and reviews found via Social Media, Autumn 2017 continues to see David and Lisa largely focused on Thai dishes such as Drunken Noodles and several styles of Curry, a chalk board of specials hanging overhead adding another five or six choices to a double-sided laminate with prices so low that one wonders how the place continues to offer such large portions without having raised prices more than a few cents over the last few years.  Employing one additional server in addition to the Husband and Wife in the kitchen, her demeanor exceedingly pleasant as she kept up with water and share-plate requests effortlessly while also packaging and acting as cashier for numerous take-out orders, it was after a lengthy perusal of the options and accounting for two guests deferral of Pork that a two-course order of nine plates was requested, five Thai Tea's and three additional orders of Rice pushing the total bill to just $22 per adult including tax and tip.  Using good ingredients and working as a very small team, Mr. Wong joining Lisa at the stove to make sure everything came out as requested in a short amount of time, it was after no more than fifteen minutes of talk as one of the youngsters watched College Football on the television that the first five plates were delivered 2-2-1, the Green Papaya Salad starting things off with a good bit of heat at \"Level 6\" while the Vietnamese Chicken Ravioli felt a little one-dimensional with Celery blunting the flavor of both finely ground Chicken and Shiitakes.    Immediately happy that someone had suggested Thai Tea to begin, the Sugar and Cream helping to quell bold spicing when transitioning from plate to plate, it was immediately on the heels of the Ravioli that two plates of Flat Noodles were presented next, the Pad See Yew recommended by Carson Kitchen Chef John Courtney packing a lot of funkiness thanks to the fermented Black Beans but still letting the thin Beef show while the Drunken Noodles bested World Famous Lotus of Siam in terms of not only flavor, but also by possessing less oil and a lower price.   Rounding out the Noodles with thin \"Linguini\" stir-fried similar to the Pad Kee Mao but with Asparagus Tips in place of Green Beans it was with share plates refreshed that a trio of Curries plus a generous portion of Basil Fried Rice were next presented, the Rice an all-around crowd pleaser with plump Shrimp and chunks of Chicken Breast hidden amidst Grains that were generally fluffy but occasionally crisp plus plenty of spices and good Produce.  With many at this point already starting to get full and family-style helpings decreasing dramatically for some it was nonetheless with wide-eyes that all took in the golden Duck resting in a pool of creamy Pumpkin Curry, the $21.95 daily special $6 cheaper than Lotus of Siam and far better executed with plenty of crispy skin and supple Flesh to go around, the sliced Beef in both Green and Panang Curries also very good though fairly similar to one another save for the fact that the Green version was a bit more spicy while the Panang was subtly nutty.  Finishing off the remaining Jasmine Rice with residual Red Curry, only a few spoonfuls of the Green returning the kitchen at meal's end, it was with most too full for Dessert that the check was requested, a shock to all when everything rang-up at just over twenty-dollars each including tax and a 20% tip for a lot of good food, attentive service and such a pleasant evening.  Called by two independent local Chefs \"a hidden gem\" while several at the table lamented having either never known about the place or having not been back in so long there is no doubt David Wong's Pan Asian belongs on the short-list of Las Vegas' best bargain dining in addition to receiving some \"Best Thai\" nods, though obviously both the size of the space and the menu indicate David and Lisa have no interest in challenging the likes of Lotus or <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FChada.in&s=d31f85f3c677f3bff5cfd6862cbf1f55167d5c2cff516cb6de4e706e8532836f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chada.in</a> terms of breadth or creativity.",

Shrimp ravioli, mango salad with grilled prawns and drunken noodles are some of our favorites when my love and I dine here, but today we had chicken noodle soup and masaman chicken curry.  The chicken noodle soup reminds me of Pho--clear broth with bean sprouts and cilantro with spicy level 4 to share...I normally get 13 on a scale of 1 through 10...I made mine to my liking by putting some spices from their spicy tray, perfectly heated for this spice-craving-girl.   Jolene has been our server most of our visits at Pan Asian...she is prompt in her service and kind...often leading a friendly conversation, checking on our needs and filling up our glasses.  The most attractive part of interior is the open kitchen...so you could see David, his wife, and their crews' dynamic energy, while taking in the aroma they create directly to our senses.   Bring your appetite to David Wong's Pan Asian and and let them satisfy your Thai food cravings.",

We ordered a second order, the kids loved it. We had pad Thai, beef basil, pumpkin curry, satay chicken, pineapple fried rice... All good! The beef was real meat...it wasn't like the rubbery pretend beef you get at a Chinese restaurant, it was certifiable meat! All the food was extremely flavorful. We picked a 5, medium heat on some of the dishes but it was way more than a 5 and I love super spicy but it had some kick there. The daughter that ordered the pineapple fried rice wasn't raving over it...that's her go to dish at all thai places, she says it was a little on the mushy side. Other than that, everything was great. The food comes out quickly. We asked for a take out menu and she said they didn't have one. I would have like to have had one, I have a drawer full of them and when I see the menu I remember they exist, so she may have lost some take out business from me as I thumb through the all the menus when I'm hungry...out of sight out of mind.",

But there's a lot of other stuff on the menu that I must try and I will update review later on for that.   My friend also got the cheesecake tempura with his entree and appetizer and he pretty much loved it. I'm not a cheesecake fan overall but it looks pretty good.   I've still got to try the crying tiger salad since it looks good. Oh, if you need more rice just ask :). They also have sticky rice.   What I always give bonus for is the service. David is the one that served us and he is extremely hospitable and friendly. Chef Lisa also made sure to ask her guests how the food was so they are both very friendly. Always a plus to see owners actually caring about your experience. They interact very well with their guests.   Photos are posted for my order as well as the crispy fried tofu and the menu. ^^v",

I'm glad that the mangos were a little on the sour side. I don't like overly ripe mango. It had little pieces of purple onion with greens and grilled shrimp. The tartness of the mango balanced out the bitterness of the charred parts of the shrimp. The dressing is nice and spicy it is so good! This salad would  even taste good without the shrimp!",

I have ordered Tom Yum Goong, a grilled shrimp mango salad, and a Filet Mignon pho. The Tom Yum Goong was just awkward with the glass noodles & big onion slices. It wasn't the Tom Yum Goong I was used to. The shrimp mango salad tasted fishy. I wasn't sure if they put too much fish sauce or if it was from the shrimp.  For my most recent visit. I went with their $5.95 pho. I ordered a spice level 5 which turned out to be too spicy. Call me a wimp but I couldn't finish the broth because it was too spicy. I enjoy a little kick but not too much to the point where it's painful to enjoy and eat. That's why I ordered a spice level in the middle. Their Thai version of pho was not my thing either. I'll just stick with traditional pho. Note, the $5.95 bowl is kid size. You'll probably be hungry after.  The lunch specials does not include soup, egg roll, and a fried wonton like the other Thai restaurants so that's another negative for me. Service was slow the first two times and OK the last visit. If you enjoy extremely spicy food and your butt being on fire, you might enjoy this place. Not for me.",

I tried the drunken noodles with beef, wife had curried vegetables, mom had ginger beef stir fry, and dad had clear noodle stir fry. Kids shared chicken fried rice with pineapple. Had the green papaya salad, shrimp egg rolls, and a Tom Yum soup all of which ran $85.   Clean bathrooms.   Food came out relatively fast considering the quality of the food is so good they are doing quite a bit of it from scratch. Food was very flavorful.   Service was friendly.

I grew up eating spicy food, and I always sigh when I order a 10 at other restaurants and it still isn't hot enough.  The owners, David & Lisa, are so kind and accommodating. They cook with a True thai spice level. My other favorite thing is how fresh and unique the vegetables are in their curries. The red curry includes  pumpkin; yellow, with sweet potatoes; massaman, with avocado. I rarely eat beef, but the flavor in the \"crying tiger\" beef salad is on point. Combined with the spice, I'm down for a few bites.   There isn't a dish here you'll regret ordering. They've perfected it all. We tend to order some sort of appetizer/salad and share two entrees. There's more than enough to enjoy the next day.",

Service was a little spotty. We didn't have all our place settings and they seemed to always forget about my little guy. Just because he sits in a high chair doesn't mean he doesn't drink water or need a plate for his food. Other than the occasional reminders, waitress was attentive and owners filled in when necessary.  Ordered the massaman curry, shrimp mango salad, pineapple fried rice, spring rolls, chicken pad thai, and satay - all without any spice due to the kids' sensitive and picky palates.  Every dish was excellent and tasty. The salad had a tad too much fish sauce for my liking but I think all Thai salads have too much fish sauce.  This was a lot of food for our family of five but I happily took home leftovers.  Not sure I would eat some of the Chinese food on the menu again, but I am definitely coming back for Thai.",

You can choose how spicy you want it.  I went with a 4 and it was still spicy for me.  I also tried the fried ice cream.  Soooo... good.  Very friendly staff and the owner was there when I was there and made sure I was satisfied with everything.",

Great food always helps to get me in the mood, LOL so I drove 15 miles to have a late lunch here.   This time I had the Grilled mango salad, Basil fried rice and Chicken Red curry. Excellent choices. The red curry was exceptional. Since Pan Asian is not close to where I live, I ordered all 3 dishes with the intent of taking home the rice and curry. David was wondering if someone else was joining me because I ordered a lot of food for 1 person, LOL.   I love the food and love the personal service. The owners - David and Lisa remember you and make you feel at home. That's very rare when you dine at Asian restaurants so they deserve a 5 star rating.",

    "text": "So we finally made it to Pan Asian!  I am happy to say, that it does not disappoint! Chef Wong has some very delicious cooking here! He was also very friendly and came to talk to us, and said he made the basil special just for us by cooking it and searing it...which really made it fragrant and added a nice consistency! I will ask for it like this next time for sure!  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pan-asian-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#JCVcxvcLGhlfJivt4Ceoww\">yelp.com/biz_photos/pan-...</a>  The drunken noodles (pad kee mao) was my most favorite way I've had this dish! And I order this EVERYWHERE I go! Chef Wong was NOT afraid to add spice, so it was a good heat and excellent flavor, especially with that basil!  The \"Basil sauce\" (pad ka pao) was good, and also had a nice heat behind it, but I really like it when the chicken is minced into very small pieces...the meat really absorbs the heat and all those juices in the sauce that way. Since these were large pieces of chicken and there were tons of green beans in there, this wasn't my most favorite way of doing it, but still good!  I don't think I've ever had more green beans in a dish before lol :  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pan-asian-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#-JTA2XZWeNY5X5T58roGSQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/pan-...</a>  And lastly, the pad thai was also good. It was a little on the sweet end, but we normally don't order this dish, so I can't really compare it to others in town. It seemed like it had a better taste though than we have had before.  It also had a great presentation :  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pan-asian-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#ek0n6bBZNz8W77UAGB17JQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/pan-...</a>  Overall, this is an excellent place to check out, especially with their lunch specials and great food!  Prices are a little cheaper here than most in town, but the servings are a tiny bit smaller too, so it works out overall.  I am not sure if I can jump out and say it is my most favorite in town, but with them making the best version of drunken noodles I've had, I will be back again for sure!",

I saw the ratings and thought this was the place. The service was solid and the prices were pretty standard. It was on a weekend, so I did not see the super awesome lunch special deals that some raved about. I ordered my go to dish that allows me to best gauge a new place - drunken noodles with chicken. These were probably the best drunken noodles I've had out of countless places that I have already tried. The price was around $11 and we also shared the calamari appetizer which was delicious at the time, but pretty forgettable. I wouldn't drive across town for the calamari, but I would go for their drunken noodles every time I am in the area to get my hair done (once a month on average). I heard the waiter make curry recommendations to other patrons, so after I have had my fill of the drunken noodles, I may venture on to the curry.",

    "text": "I thought the food was lavorful and the service friendly but it took way too long.  We spent a total of 2.75 hours in that place for dinner. Will be back to try other items on the menu out of curiousity...  I wanted to love the fried Basil Rice but it was just shy of fabulous! It was hardy with a combo of chicken, shrimp and beef.  There were a lot of veggies too.  It was decent but not fab.  The green curry was typical.  Nothing out of the ordinary.  Again, I wanted to love it but it was pretty standard and was lacking some variation of veggies.  The dish did have healthy helpings of al dente green beans and a few red peppers but it was a little flat.  Thank goodness for the spice #5 to kick it up a notch.  The interesting winner of the evening was the RED CURRY dish.  My husband and I agreed that it was the best of the three.  It had unique ingredients.  Eggplant, Pumpkin, Green Beans, Tomatoes etc. it did have more going on but it was more flavorful too.    Then on to Mango Sticky Rice! MY FAV! Blissfull sounds of joy in every bite! MY only complaint was the creme fresh that was laddled on top was pegged with SALT!? It was so overpowering that we scrapped it off the top and continued with our food-gazims.    This place is not horrible but it wasn't spectacular! I really want it to be so I am going back to try some more menu items.  I think it's a very interesting concept to mesh all these types of asian cusines into singular dishes but sometimes you just want A-typical Thai or Singaporian food and this you won't find here.  It's a melting pot for all Asian types of cusine.  Once you can wrap your head around that idea then you'll appreciate it for what it is... Pan Asian.",

Stopped in for take out around 6:30pm. Smells great and has a really warm environment.  The first thing that I noticed is that the dinning area is 1/3 the size of the open kitchen. You can see everything they are doing, which I tend to like.   The gentleman working there (Owner?) was extremely friendly. He asked if I had eaten there before. When I said no, he asked it I eat Asian food often and If I would need assistance deciding what to eat. I found this to be very thoughtful.  I ordered chicken Pad See Ew which was ready in well under 10 minutes. WARNING: I got #2 spicy and it kinda kicked my ass.  I docked them 1 STAR for giving me A CHOP STICK, which as far as I am aware, are supposed to come in pair.

    "text": "We returned to Pan Asian this afternoon, which prompted me to update my review.  Went with the Linguine again (level 4 spicy), and it was absolute perfection.  Based on other reviews and despite not being big curry fans, we went with the Massaman Curry with Chicken, and it was a pleasant surprise to say the least.  Tried the fried cheesecake for dessert, which was significantly better than the fried ice cream.  The Thai Iced Tea and Coffee were also superb.  Service was exceptional and pleasant again.  One of our favorite Thai restaurants for sure, and a definite stop during future Vegas trips.",

They have lunch specials for only about 6 bucks and it comes with a drink. The place isn't very big maybe 6-8 tables, but it's clean and I can see right into the kitchen which is a HUGE bonus in my book. It kinda freaks me out when I cant see what the cook looks like or how my food is cooked. The owner is super friendly and jokes that he needs more business to hire a dish washer because he is tired of washing them himself LOL Great food good prices and super friendly service = an A+ in my book.",

    "text": "Eating here was a good experience.  I bought the Yelp Deal: $20 for $10.  I've decided that Groupon mostly sends you to places that are having troubles for a reason.  That is, I'm usually disappointed with the Groupon experiences.  Yelp Deals, on the other hand, have turned out pretty good so far.  This place is a little far from home.  Usually, if I drive this far then I just go on down to Chinatown.  Parking was ok.  Upon entering I turned to my girlfriend and commented about how this was probably going to be a bad experience because the place was totally empty.  It was around 6:45 pm on Tuesday.  But, we settled in determined to give it a fair try.  I began noticing all of the nice things about the place.  It was nicely decorated.  I assume the owner did the decorating.  I describe it as contemporary Asian.  It was not high end Vegas strip decorating style, but more like well put together do it yourself style.  The kitchen was in full view of the dining area.  I always like that.  I cringe to think what goes on out of sight.  So many restaurant shows today let us normal people peek behind the curtain and witness the often disgusting truth.  Also, I was delighted to see Asian people making Asian food.  At least makes me believe I'm in for authentic flavors.  Modern music played lightly over the audio system.  It was pleasant.  I assume the man waiting on us was the owner, David Wong.  He was very friendly and attentive.  He did a really good job.  He tried very hard to give us a great experience.  Every item on the menu was under $11.  That's pretty good.  I like good food, but I enjoy it even better when I feel like I'm getting a good deal.  The menu had a variety of Asian dishes, as the name implies: Thai, Malaysian, Vietnamese, etc.  We ordered two dishes.  The first was Filet Mignon Pho.  It was a Thai version of Vietnamese Pho.  My Thai girlfriend explained that the abundance of roasted garlic was a signature difference.  The sauces were all added before serving.  The veggies were slightly different (can't explain) and the meat was filet mignon (Wow! Step It Up!).  The noodles were cooked just right.  I enjoyed the Pho, but there are way better places to get Pho in this town.  The second dish was Basil Sauace Stir Fry.  It had chicken, sweet basil, garlic, chili tomatoes, and long beans served with rice.  Spiciness was 8 out of 10.  It was really tasty.  I specifically enjoyed the fresh veggies.  My only complaint was that the dish had too much oil.  I realized just how much after we finished the dish and were left staring at the puddle before us.  It made me feel a little bad about something I had just enjoyed.  We were pretty much full, but wanted to spend at least $20 for the Yelp deal so we ordered another entree.  We had asked the server earlier what their signature dish was.  He recommended the Pad-See-Yaw.  So, that's what we ordered.  It was pan-fried flat noodles with pork, broccoli, black soy beans, and egg.  My girlfriend explained that this dish is commonly ordered by Caucasians at Thai restaurants.  She was surprised that I had never heard of it (we usually eat Thai food at her house, not restaurants).  It was very sweet.  My girlfriend and the server had a quick conversation in Thai.  He asked if we wanted a dessert.  We said no, but I thought the sweet Pad-See-Yaw was dessert.  After he left, my girlfriend explained that she told him it was too sweet and he replied that its how Americans like it.  I thought that was funny.  We were already full when the third dish came out so we tasted it and put it in a to go box.  The server came by and chatted with us for a while.  He explained that he had been open for about nine months.  Before that he had a successful high end Asian restaurant in Florida.  Articles hung on the wall behind us explaining it.  By the time we left it had become pretty busy.  The place had four or five more couples and a few take out customers came through.  Overall, it was a good experience.  The server was attentive and the food came out fast.  The menu was very affordable.  The decorations were interesting and inviting.  I really wanted to give it five starts, but  the food was good, not great.  Its worth a try.",

The veggies that came with the snapper were also limp, a sign that they were not fresh. All in all pretty disappointing",

It's run by a husband wife combo and boy do they know how to cook.  We ordered pad-thai and the Red curry.  Both were amazing.  I asked it to be extremely spicy because I love spice.  They didnt make it as spicy as I wanted it to be, but I dont care - it tasted amazing.  They make it to your taste if you ask them too.  It's like a home cooked meal basically.  The husband wife are from NY and are very entertaining and friendly as well.  We also finished off the meal with fried ice cream which was tasty.  Would move to vegas to eat here often. :)",

I would like to try their other dishes, especially the ones other reviews have spoken of, like the red snapper.  Side note: Their spicy level is based on 1-10.

    "text": "Holy crap! The other Yelpers aren't kidding when they say this place is great.   Pan Asian is tucked away in a strip mall and it's easy to miss if you're not looking for it. But it's definitely worth seeking out! The owner wasn't the friendliest which usually stands out in my mind, but the food was so amazing that I quickly forgave and forgot.  The restaurant itself is very small with limited seating and has a sort of \"fast food\" feel to it (maybe like a step or two up from the atmosphere of a Subway restaurant.) Although, I believe they do offer waiter-service if you choose to eat inside. It's also very clean and the kitchen is wide open, which I thought was neat. Overall, it's a perfect lunch-spot but certainly not somewhere you'd take a date.  I ordered my food to-go and went off the menu that's posted on the wall. I ordered the fried calamari, the stir-fried linguine and the crying tiger salad.   The calamari was very bland and the dipping sauce didn't help it out much at all. But the linguine and the salad made up for it with flying colors!   I ordered the linguine at a spicy-level of 8 which is perfect for me at every other Thai restaurant I've been to in Las Vegas because I loooove spicy, but Pan Asian does not mess around. An 8 set my mouth on fire, but the dish was still so freaking delicious that I ate it anyway, gulping water in between each bite. I will definitely order it again but probably at a spicy level of 5 or 6 next time.  I ordered the crying tiger salad for my husband (at a spicy level of 3) but it seriously had to be the best salad I've ever had because I couldn't stop stealing bites from him. I don't know how they made the dressing but it's incredible. I truly believe that even people who aren't huge fans of salad (like me) would love this. It's just drenched in flavor. That's the best I can describe it.  Overall, I'd definitely recommend this place and I'll definitely be going back next time I'm in the area. Two thumbs up for Pan Asian!",

    "text": "After last night's fiasco at Lily's Thai-Vietnamese-Chinese restaurant, I had to think twice about trying another Thai-Vietnamese-Japanese fusion place so soon, BUT the $10 for $20 Yelp offer and the 4.5star rating after hundreds of reviews, I decided to give David Wong's Pan Asian a chance and I AM SO GLAD I DID! The food was SO DELICIOUS that we actually went back there the next night bringing the rest of the crew JUST so they can try the CRYING TIGER SALAD! Me & my family have now found a new fave place to eat! We ordered various items on the menu, and they were all good, food was freshly made and NO MSG! I am just going to give you a run down of MAI FAVES though, so here goes, definitely try the Roti, it comes with a  lightly sweet Malaysian yellow curry dipping sauce, the curries were really good too, we tried the massaman, & the panang, & the Pad See Ew was so flavorful , we tried the shrimp tiger salad with mangoes, that was delicious as well, but I have to say that the STAR of the dinner table was the Crying Tiger Salad, the steak was cooked just right, it melted in your mouth, you can tell it's char broiled, the dressing was phenomenal! I have to warn you though,they don't call it Crying Tiger for nothing, be careful when ordering your spice # coz the spiciness will make a tiger cry! I had # 3 and it was SPICY but good! My crazy husband dared to get # 4! Most of their menu items are spicy, so if you are not into spicy food your choices will be limited, but the owners and chef are VERY accommodating and will try to cater to your specific needs. Oh, and yes dessert, we definitely had room for dessert. We tried the fried ice cream as well as the fried cheesecake, I definitely like the fried cheese cake better, although we did clean both plates, Hungry much? We are definitely coming back to this place, it is pretty small, but I like to call it cozy, oh & YES they speak very fluent English! You can see the chef, who is David Wong's wife, lovingly preparing the meal you are about to chow down. You can clearly tell that she puts her heart & soul into her cooking, even though this is a small mom & pop restaurant all the dishes are presented like a work of art. They take pride in their product that is why they give it their best. So if you are having second thoughts, banish those fears from your brain, try this place out and you will discover a gem in the middle of Sahara.",

I wasn't impressed, I've had better at other Thai restaurants.  Service was a bit slow, took awhile to get my food and check.

    "text": "GREAT FOOD! I went here with my boyfriend on a Sunday afternoon. They weren't busy and we were seated right away (always a plus in my book). We started with an appetizer plate of Coconut Shrimp. It came with peanut sauce and sweet and sour. Very good! I am very picky when it comes to Non-American food, so I basically just stick to what seems familiar. I ordered the Basil Fried Rice at a level #1. It was loaded with chicken, shrimp, green beans, tomatoes, peppers and of course a ton of basil. It was absolutely delicious and the amount of food was two meals for me, so I ended up taking half of it home. My boyfriend ordered the Massaman Curry (that may be spelled wrong). It had chicken, potato, sweet potato, peppers and was served with a side of rice. He ordered this at a level #4. The flavor was delicious, but it was way too hot for me. It was just right for him and he loved it. The service was fast and friendly and we will be going back again soon.",

    "text": "A place we go on the regular was closed today so my friend and I decided to try another place out.  We Yelp'd!! around our area and found this place which came up first and had some great reviews.  We were super excited because we LOVE Thai food and curry is my favorite and the reviews for this place were awesome.   It's kind of hard to see from the street - which is odd because it faces the street.  The sign is hard to read and doesn't really pop so for those driving by I can understand passing it on your first try.  We walked in and the place was cutely decorated, but kind of a divey place in my opinion.  There is no air conditioning running, so I couldn't imagine eating anything spicy there!! I'd probably die.  The owner, David, was very sweet.  He was excited to have customers and wanted to make sure he made our food the way we wanted - he warned us of the spice levels as well!  I got a 6 and it was just perfect.  My friend is a spice FREAk and wanted an 8, but he warned her to try a 6 - she regrets not getting the 8!   I ordered the Massaman curry because of a review that said \"curry lovers must try this\" and my friend got the Panang curry (my usual fave) The plan was to half both of them and share.  To my dismay the curry was scarce.  It had great flavor, but when I poured it over the rice there were a ton of vegetables and barely any curry.  I was surprised because for $10 I feel like the container should be at least half way full.  I pay $8 at some places that give me 5 times what I got here.  It was very disapppointing.  I did enjoy the flavor, but I won't pay $20 for a full size curry.  Also, I love avocados so I was intrigued, but I don't think they belong in a curry.  Just an odd texture and flavor to mix...  We brought another plate of pad thai to go for my friends roommate and he says it was mediocre, nothing special.  Not to hate on this place, but just bein' honest :) It was A-ok.",

After a whole day of shopping with a friend of mine, I choose the restaurant for dinner and loved everything I ate (granted it was only two dishes).  I ordered a chicken garlic pepper and my friend ordered a chicken red curry.  They asked both of us what level of spice we wanted and they made the spice to the tee!  Her's was a 6-7 and mine was a 3...It reminds me of my parents restaurant they used to own in Dallas, very personable, small and friendly!  It was the mom, dad and daughter!  The favors were very unique, unlike most Asian restaurants I have been too, where they just sloop on soy sauce and call it Szechuan sauce, black bean sauce or garlic sauce...everything had a very distinct favor to it!  Which made the meal even more savoring and worth going back again and again to try all the dishes.   I loved the food we had that I ordered a red curry with chicken to take home.  The only thing that was a bit difficult was the place was a bit hard to find.  But I know where it is located now so I don't think it will be a problem.    Definitely going back!",

Just about 10 minutes off the Strip on the way to Red Rocks located in a quiet neighborhood shopping center. The food was fantastic. We had the crispy tofu and edamame for appetizers. For entree we got yellow curry w chicken and the pad EE sew. We asked for crispy tofu with that one but it came out with chicken instead. Chef Wong himself came out and apologized and made a new order immediately. I was impressed. I was half expecting him to just fry some tofu then bring it on the side not remake an entire dish. Great customer service. I thought it was a great sign that there were a couple of regular locals that came in and he even greeted them by name from he open kitchen. Such a different spin from the usual hectic \"give me your order then give me your money\" Chinese places back home.",

They make everything fresh and there is only one cook in the kitchen, so my only complaint is that the food can take a little long to come out, but it is well worth it.  The red curry has eggplant and pumpkin in it!  I was surprised at the ingredients since I'm so used to just bell pepper and bamboo in my red curry, but the owner told me that's how the royals eat it and he didn't want to put that \"cheap stuff\" in there.  I may have a hard time eating red curry anywhere else now!  The pumpkin is so good and unexpected in it.    I've also tried their linguine dish, which was flavorful and tasty.  It really reminded me of Pad Kea Mow at Archi's Thai.  Their pho was ok, but I am so partial to Pho So 1, that it's tough to impress me with pho.  The food is great and the owner is very friendly.  He remembers everyone who walks through the door!  He really pays attention to his food and his customers, which is much appreciated by this patron.",

I highly recommend the Scallop Amok (scallops, napa cabbage, lime leaf, lemon grass, chili, basil, and coconut steamed in banana leaf Cambodian style) that traditionally is cooked for four hours! It tastes like a spicy seafood egg custard. Pad see-yew  which is a pan fried noodles with Chinese broccoli, black soy beans and  egg is just okay.  Pork red curry with pumpkin eggplant bell peppers coconut milk is too sweet for my taste. I want my curry spicier. They have daily specials and I chose the Pan seared salmon with mango sauce, greens, cashews--- it's very refreshing but a bit salty from the fish sauce. They have better thai iced tea compared to other places. Fast efficient service. The owner himself went to our table and explained their menu which I think is a nice touch. Will definitely come back. I'd like to try the mango sticky rice for dessert but already so full--- next time ;)",

He warned us but we still ordered food at a varying levels from 3-7 spicy level.  All of us were completely satisfied after we scarfed everything down.  We're a bunch of pigs so we ordered the following dishes for family style sharing: 1.  Crying Tiger - This is a refreshing salad of seared beef with greens and tangy spicy dressing 2.  Malaysian Roti - Deep fried dough with lovely potato curry 3.  Basil Fried Rice - Yea!  Bring on the heat and flavor! 4.  Spicy Basil with chicken - Yummy stir fry with a bunch of different greens  5.  Black Pepper Chicken - Similar to the spicy basil stir fry but more black bean sauce. 6.  Pineapple Fried Rice - This had a very pleasant aroma of curry and pineapple. Delish! 7.  Red Snapper - Delicious seafood in a non-fancy restaurant?  It sure it.  It was deep fried with tangy sweet and sour sauce. 8.  Duck Curry - This was my fav of the night!  This duck was cooked with LOVE!  The skin was perfectly crunchy and when paired with the curry sauce, it was heaven. 9.  Tempura Icecream - Standard deep fried yumminess 10.  Tempura Cheesecake - Standard deep fried yumminess  Conclusion:  It's impressive that a restaurant can offer so many different Asian dishes and do them all so well!  Sorry Michelle's waistline, this restaurant is around the corner, so we're coming more often!",

David even remembered us from our one visit (8 months ago) and my initial review on the place.  *blush*  Anyway, this is what we had:  Crying Tigers (again) - still oh so good Pad Sew-Yee (or something) with beef/spice level 4 - very good, will probably go up to spice level 6 next time Malaysian Yellow Curry with chicken/spice level 4 - very good, thought about getting another to go for later cravings (I do live about 25-30 from this glorious place). Tempura Cheesecake - *sigh* so bad for the body but so good for the mouth!  As you can see my dedication to delightful and unique foods will force me to drive...almost anywhere.  I wish I could visit more often.  And the prices are just right.  An average plate is $7-$9 (I tend to round up when I see $8.95, just so you know).  David, thanks for the wonderful service and please, give our compliments to the chef.  ;)",

Great feeling when you first walk in.  Chef David greets you warmly and lets you know that your dining experience will be wonderful.    His menu had several items for non-meat eaters and the I had the Tofu Cashew.  Excellently prepared and perfectly tasty.  I will be coming back weekly!",

    "text": "This place is definitely a hidden gem. I use to live near Pan Asian and would drive past it all the time, but I never knew it existed until I found it here on Yelp! The restaurant itself is pretty small, there are mostly 2 seat-tables and a few 4 seat-tables, probably enough to fit 20 people in total. When I came in for dinner, there were only 2 or 3 other tables occupied.   Looking at the menu, most of the dishes are Thai, with a few Chinese and Vietnamese twists here and there. I ordered the Stir-Fry Linguine with chicken and my friend ordered the Pad Thai with chicken. At other Thai restaurants I would usually request a 6 or 7 out of 10 on the spice level for my food, but the owner told me that their level 5 spice was the equivalent of 7 or 8 at other places, so I ordered a 4. Thank god I did because my linguine came out to be quite spicy! There was an abundance of chicken meat, peppers, and asparagus in my dish, and the flavor was great without being overbearing. I had a taste of my friend's Pad Thai and it was also tasty, but because my friend didn't add any spice to it, I didn't enjoy it as much as my linguine.   Service was great, the owner was very attentive to each customer's needs and our drinks were constantly being refilled. Prices are very reasonable and there are lunch specials. The next time I come here I plan to tackle their curries!",

    "text": "Over indulgence on spectacular food is easy at Pan Asian. My sister is back in town and I have my eating partner back. We share the same philosophy of sharing food to maximize our chances of trying multiple dishes and sometimes to cut back on calories. We will even order one dish at one restaurant and move to another to try something else.  Not here at Pan Asian. We sat down and ordered enough to keep us full the whole day. They are running a special with Yelp, a $10 for $20. This is steal because you can get a whole lot of food for twenty. We started off with their famous chicken wings. 7 or 8 large meaty wings came out, fried to perfection, and NON-BREADED. I hate breaded wings because they get soggy fast. These were some of the best wings I have ever had. They come with a side of thousand island. My sister and I normally don't like mayo, but we lightly smeared on a bit. If that was not enough, I had ordered the level 7 Tofu Massaman Curry. It was no inferno, but it had the creep up on you heat. There is a genuine point to their scale. I am tired of ordering a ten and wondering where the spice is. The sweet potato were soft, the avocado creamy, and the tofu lightly fried. In the end, the sauce was all that was left and I ended up spooning that on top of the Fried Clear Noodles. My sister even ate a full bowl of rice because the curry was just that good. Most of the time she eats half a bowl and feigns being full. I am beginning to learn that usual habits will go out the window when you enter the door.  It was cool because we witnessed them filming a segment on local eats. Look for Doreen Fang's blog to watch the spot on Pan Asian. There were some delays in order being made because of it, but it was like being in the audience of a cooking show. Speaking with Doreen after was awesome because she is putting a lot of emphasis on local mom and pop shops.",

An update, it is busier now, and Lisa (the chef) still does the cooking herself, so it may take longer than before. It is well worth the wait. Some of my favorites: the Crying Tiger salad, the Shrimp Ravioli, the Pad Thai (it was pink!), the Pad Cha with fish  (sp? and not on the menu), the crispy duck, any duck, and, yes, the stir fried linguini with asparagus is a real favorite. They are friendly, the food is fantastic, it is made with love, care, and good ingredients, and the kitchen is open.

    "text": "So many four and five star reviews from Yelp Elite can't be wrong, right? RIGHT!  Picked up asian takeout for three tonight for just under $30- seafood soup, beef pad se ew, and chicken masaman curry, extra side of rice. Portions were okay but were split among three, pricing was fair but seafood soup could have been larger. Good for $7 price, but not a meal on its own. Curry was heavy on the potatoes, so with the rice it was pretty starchy, but that kept it from being too spicy. Pad se ew was among the best BF has had, and it's the main thai dish he gets everywhere we go. Side note about the soup: pick out the green pepper pieces prior to eating unless you want to spit out your soup in spicy surprise. Otherwise, the mix of crab, mussels, shrimp, and octopus is delightful.  Service was good. Ordered to go, just a few minutes prior to close, and was helped with a smile and the order was out quick. Saw a few pictures of dishes above the counter after we ordered, but did not find them on the menu itself- shrimp and fish ball soup, duck soup, etc., unclear whether they're special features, by request only, or no longer on the menu.  Would come back here, and we'd likely try different dishes- the garlic chicken in particular caught my eye, as did the drunken noodles. Maybe better for lunch specials though, pricing looks a little better at ~$7/dish.",

I suggest sharing food family style so you can try the many great dishes here.  Thai tea/coffee was good but it's on the pretty sweet side. You may want to ask them not to make it so sweet beforehand.   service was great - friendly interaction with the whole staff - not just the waiter but the chef and sous chefs.

There is a meager total of 12 chairs in the whole dining area (which was 75% full while we were there). I'm not sure what kind of capacity they can achieve in that space, but if Dal Lat can squeeze in seating for 34 in their tiny restaurant, Pan Asian could probably at least double their current seating chart.  Anthony M and I both ordered the Massaman Curry - I went with beef while he got tofu. This curry dish is on the sweet side, but the heat balanced it out for me. It was a good serving size and I enjoyed everything about it. The large chunks of potato and carrot, the ample pieces of beef, and the flavorful curry all came together very well.  For some reason, the chef offered us some fried banana on the house. It was a generous gesture, but it strangely took a long time to come out and quite honestly, I didn't really enjoy it. It's probably a Filipino thing, but thanks to Turon, any fried banana that doesn't come with jackfruit automatically falls short.  Nevertheless, I enjoyed my meal and will definitely return to try other items. I was almost tempted to \"pull a Misti\" (yes, we are hereby coining a new phrase) i.e. I was tempted to come back for dinner on the same day. (I didn't).",

    "text": "Pan Asian is literally just down the street from where I am currently living at. It has been opened for only 2-3 weeks and without a splashy and eye catching sign, it may be easy to drive past on Durango unless you are really looking for it.  The restaurant has a large kitchen and prep area, but the dining area is comparatively small.  At the moment there are not too many tables and chairs setup (seating capacity is probably only at 16-20).  The interior is decorated simply but nicely.  The owner David Wong and his wife, the chef, are both super friendly.  After my first spontaneous visit after just having had dinner at another new restaurant that recently opened just down he street, mainly based on Misti Y's positive comments about this new restaurant.  So I was looking to see what their menu offers and try some desserts.  The Thai dessert looks interesting, but I was told that it was not available that day and to try the Cheesecake Tempura. It was regular slice of cheesecake that was cut into smaller pieces and tempura fried. It has a different texture and if you enjoyed fried desserts, this one is probably something you should try.  The next day I dropped by after a stop at the Costco Food Truck Fest #2, and tried the Massaman Chicken Curry.  It was tasty and the portion was generous. Before I left, the chef also gave me a large cup of longan tea (on the house)  that she brewed from dried longan that her relatives visiting from Thailand had brought her.  The flavor is sweet, as it was sweetened with brown sugar, and maybe that was why it also reminded me of the Winter Melon Tea that I used to drink when I was in Taiwan.  I really enjoyed the drink and the generous gesture.  Day 3, I had a Sababa Groupon to redeem before it expires. So after finishing the Sababa Special, which I thought would fill me up, I still had room for dessert and dropped in again to see if Thai Sticky Rice and Mango would be on the menu.  Lucky for me, the chef said if I was willing to wait a few minutes, she will make it from scratch for me.  It was a simple and very traditional Thai dessert served especially during the summer, when mango are in season.  And My T and his wife just happened to drop in for dinner.    With a friendly couple that runs the restaurant and serving good food at reasonable prices, Pan Asian is already starting to get a decent Yelp following.  I know I will be back soon to try more of the menu.  Decor:  4/5  Minimalist decorations that just works for the space.  Food:  5/5 I enjoyed the food I have ordered thus far.    Service:  5/5  The owner and his wife, Chef Lisa, are both super friendly. Can't have a meal prepared and served to you by a nicer couple.  Price/Value:  5/5  The price is fair and the portions are pretty generous. Lunch menu portion is the same as the dinner, so an even greater value.  Location is super close by, and even after I move a little further away, still worth the detour back from work or to satisfy a Pan Asian craving.",

    "text": "My family and I absolutely LOVE Pan Asian!!! I have never heard of this place until I received an email from Yelp recommending this place. Honestly it was the other reviewers pic and comments that enticed me to go and try. I was looking forward to seeing/meeting the owner David because of all the compliments of how nice and hospitable he was.   We went in on a Saturday around lunch time and there was another couple in there. I was surprised and a little excited to see that David was in fact there.  He seemed very polite, there was any unnecessary hostess or waiters, just him.  Which I liked. I had my two children with me, one in which is a 3 year old and David paid extra special attention to them.   Another great observation was that it had an open kitchen as to where you are able to see what and who was cooking the meal. A real plus for me because I like to see the cleanliness of the kitchen.   Everything I ordered was purely based on yummy pics of precious yelpers. This was what we ordered:  Appetizers: chicken satay and Vietnamese ravioli  Entrees: XO pork spareribs, pad seeyew with chicken, and the DW fried rice  Dessert: deep fried cheesecake  We loved everything except the ravioli. Prices weren't too bad.  My fave part was when David came over and asked my kids if they wanted ice cream and of course they said yes. It was complimentary of course. And I loved that. The cheesecake was heavenly!!!! The fried rice was the tastiest ever!!!! We shall be back soon!!! Go and try it!  Ps-I ordered a Thai coffee and It was THE BEST everrrrrrrr!!!!",

Even the won ton soup is good and we all know of a lot of places that don't bother to do this world famous soup justice. Funny thing is , I have never actually stepped foot in the restaurant. This place is definitely my takeout comfort food place ! :) One day I will make it to the actual place. And remember always tip the delivery driver :)",

Mixed greens, cashew nuts, mango, red onions, bell peppers, Asian herbs, chili lime dressing.  Such a perfect, tasty, light and healthy lunch!  We also had SCALLOP AMOK - $8.95.  Napa cabbage, lime leaf, lemon grass, chili, basil and coconut steamed in a banana leaf - Cambodian Style.  This was the first time I had ever seen or had Amok and it was so delicious!  I will defintely have this again!  We also had Pineapple Fried Rice but we left the Shrimp out due to someone with an allergy.  Oh so wonderful. - $10.95 Chicken, pineapple, cashew nuts, raisins, tomatoes, onions, scallions and egg.  Everyone enjoyed what they had.  The seasonings were fresh and authentic Thai.    I also love that the decor is modern and fresh and relaxing.  You can bring in a large family or  have a small table, this restaurant still provides an relaxing environment.   David came out and chatted with us a during the meal and made sure we had everything we needed to have a wonderful experience and that the kids had what they needed.  Can't wait to go back!",

Green beans have never tasted so good. Fair warning, it is SPI-CAAAY! They let you pick 1-10, we went for five and it was really spicy. I can't fathom what ten would taste like.",

My favorite noodle dish is the clear noodles with veggies and the garlic stir fry with tofu, both a level 2 of spiciness, lol.   I love that the clear noodles come with a good amt of veggies to noodles ratio, haha.  It's a good combination with the bok choy and the mushrooms.  The garlic stir fry is da bomb.  If you love garlicky food, then this is the dish for you.  The tofu is so crunchy and is complimented well with all the garlic in the dish.  Both dishes are fresh and I love how it's cooked in a wok.  The servers are very nice and I'm always greeted.  The owner is always there and if you're dining in, he'll talk to you and find out how the meal was. Give them a try, you'll like it",

Then I started feeling like this place has my home food. I'm not from Thailand so it's definitely not the food I grew up with; however their Tom yum soup is still my no 1 comfort food I go for whenever I'm sick or feeling sad.

My girlfriend and I were so impressed with the fresh flavors that we ended up coming back 3 times in a matter of a week and a half.   So far I've tried, Pork fried rice (which isn't on the menu as far as meat wise but David was more than happy to make it), Chicken Pad Thai, Shrimp Tom yum, Beef rice noodle pho, volcano chicken (house special) and stir fried linguine.    Pork fried rice - literally the Cadillac of fried rice. Best I've ever had and I love eating fried rice from everywhere.  Pad Thai - heads and shoulders better than most Thai places here in Vegas.  Even better than my beloved Archi's.  Shrimp Tom yum - Spicy but wicked fresh.  Loved it.  Beef Rice noodle pho - This is what changed the game.  I don't think I've ever been to a restaurant that has had more than 1 item that I considered the best I have ever had.  There's not even words to describe how amazing it is. Just try it. Please. Like now.  Volcano chicken - Sweet breaded fried chicken with a hint of spicy.  Flavor was out of this world.   Stir Fried Linguine - girlfriend got this and she hates linguine.  We figured if there's something that we might not like it would be this. WRONG. It was epic and now has me second guessing why I have never liked linguine.    TLDR; Come here and eat David's amazing food.  Will not disappoint and you will %100 have a favorite dish or 2 here.",

Everything we had was delicious and we plan on trying different items when we come back.",

Good portion & delivered pretty hot for around $4 delivery charge and an additional tip. Worth it if you can't get away for lunch or dinner and want good fast food.   I've tried the mango salad (total yum) the drunken noodles, the pad sewee with chicken (super yum) Vietnamese spring rolls (pass on this one) Singapore noodles (tasty).    My fave which I constantly crave is Volcano Chicken.  I get spicy level 7 and it's pretty spicy that way.  The level you order is 1-10 with 10 being crazy hot/spicy.   All of the food is excellent except I would not order the spring rolls again. I think for around $7.95 for 4 small spring rolls it is not worth it. They are not any better than most Chinese restaurants that give them for free.   Fresh food which seems relatively healthy ! Hard to beat !  I just wish they were open on Sun.  Do they know that Block 9 is also closed on Sun?  Seems every Sun I am craving Thai and can't get it via take out or dine in.   Doesn't everyone want to eat out on weekends?   Would not a \"Mon\" or \"Tue\" be a better day to be closed on ?   I still LOVE IT!",

How anyone can give this place less than 4 stars is beyond me. There are always going to be those negative nellys that only look for what they can complain about.   I give the space and decor 4/5 stars - it is small and decor is minimal, but it works.

    "text": "Right next day coming back from my 6 week trip to Korea, I was craving for Thai Food so badly (had enough of Soon-tofu Jjigae and Kim-chi back home :) :P  Well, I've been told that this new Thai restaurant is so great that I should try it as soon as I return from my vacation. I was dying to try this new Thai Restaurant in my neighborhood and glad that finally I tried out!   I shared two dishes with Mr Tea' for lunch; Panang Curry & Crying Tiger  The Panang Curry was really good and tasty.. I enjoyed having my Panang Curry not too sweat and it was just right!  The Crying Tiger was a dish that I tried out for the first time.. It was a handful plate of green salad with lots of red onions and grilled steak. The flavor of lime, garlic, chili, and fish sauce were very strong. But I love fish sauce in general,, like often used in Vietnamese, Thai, or Korean dishes. I thought the dish was little bit salty to me since the main ingredient was a Thai fish sauce but,, honestly it was better in taste after try it out over the Jasmin Rice that we got it for the curry.  I can't say too much about this place yet, but I love to go back and try many items from the menu. The price is about the same as any other Thai Restaurant in town.  This place will be definitely one of my favorite restaurants to grab a lunch or dinner.....   So why do I want to rave about this place...the chef, the food, warm smile by staffs, and the friendly service.. Oh, YES~~life cant get much better :)",

It is close enough to go to for lunch with coworkers.  The amount and quality of the food is a great value for the very reasonable prices.  Really clean place too.

The restaurant is quaint with a few tables. Interior is simple and understated. You can see right into the kitchen and see the chef in action.   My husband and I were greatly warmly by the owner and he made suggestions per our request. The prices were fairly decent. Based on the quick tips on Yelp, we ordered the Vietnamese Shrimp Ravioli, Crying Tiger Salad, Massaman Curry with chicken and DW Fried Rice. We figured we might as well order a lot so we can have leftovers for later. We devoured all of the food and there wasn't a grain of rice left to take home.  I loved all of the food but the Crying Tiger Salad pulled at my heart strings. The flavors were so distinctive and strong and I have never tasted a salad like it before. I always order Massaman Curry from Thai places; Pan Asian raised the bar for me. The curry had the right amount of sweetness and heat. It came with avocado and sweet potatoes, which I've never seen before in other restaurants, and they were cooked to perfection.  The chef came by our table to check if we enjoyed our meal. She was so sweet and we couldn't sing her praises enough.  I pointed out at least ten more items on the menu that I have to try. I will definitely need to order more next time so I can enjoy some leftovers!",

They make you feel right at home and follow through with some tasty food.  My wife and I started with the tiger shrimp and mango salad with red onion, red bell pepper, and cashews. Perfection. It was savory, sweet, and spicy--everything you could ask for.  We followed up with the chicken Panang curry with gorgeous green beans and bok choy. The ingredients weren't submerged in sauce, which as David explained, is how they do it where he is from in Thailand. Instead the dish is nicely coated with a healthy helping of curry, which wonderfully united the textures and flavors of the fresh vegetables and chicken.  For dessert, we had tempura fried ice cream. Yup, 'nuff said.  If you're after fresh and affordable food, give Pan Asian a try. I know I'll be back again and again.  Did I mention it was fresh?",

I used to get takeout from Archi's but it proved to be too cumbersome with the order mistakes and time having to wait once i arrived. Pan Asian blew me away! The pad see ew that I ordered was delicious, hot and generously portioned. I called the order in as I left work and by the time I walked in it was ready. The cashier recognized me somehow because he knew where I worked, and no I didn't have my badge on! Service was friendly and I was back to work at my desk within 20 minutes of when I left. I am so going to start trying this places other dishes.",

    "text": "4.5 stars, rounded up to 5. (and I rarely round up!) I am a HUGE fan of Pan Asian, and an even bigger fan of owner David Wong and his wife, Lisa, the chef! They are awesome people serving tasty, fresh food- hence the reason I round up.   My first encounter was during lunch with my toddler daughter. We started with the Chicken Gyoza- and I could barely get a bite because my daughter practically ate the entire plate herself.  I also ordered the Pad See Ew with tofu- and it was probably the best I have ever had. And I have eaten A LOT of Pad See Ew.    Came back for lunch yesterday, and as much as I wanted to order the Pad See Ew again, I thought I should try something new. I ordered the Massaman Curry that other yelpers have been raving about.  It was my first time trying this dish and I am sad that I hadn't tried it sooner.  The potatoes and carrots were perfect and the avocado, bell peppers, and peanuts gave it a nice texture.   My husband ordered the Thai style \"Pho\" and the broth was BURSTING with flavor.  I am a huge fan of Vietnamese Pho and have very high standards, but I have found a new love in this Thai version. Even after my husband added spice to it, it only enhanced the flavor and made it even better.  This is one dish that I can't stop thinking about.  I can't wait to go back and have a bowl all to myself.   My toddler daughter was being a tad bratty and wouldn't sit still to eat her meal, so David came to my rescue and bribed her with some ice cream (with my permission of course).  Well, she sat like a perfect angel and ate her lunch.  We also ordered the fried bananas, and like Paolo D., I prefer the Filipino version with jackfruit- but I must say that the coconut and sesame seeds in this dish was a nice surprise, and my daughter's vanilla ice cream was the perfect accompaniment.",

So don't come here thinking they have anything Japanese or Chinese.  The place was small so not great for large groups. They had portable heaters to heat the dining area. Not very classy but you do what you gotta do. The food was good. The fried calamari was ok, they could of used fresher oil. The Vietnamese shrimp ravioli were awesome. Very fresh and had a real good flavor. The drunken noodles were definitely drunk in oil.  I don't know if I'd go out of my way to come here again but if I'm in the area it may be considered. The chef were very friendly and they had their regulars.  All in all it wasn't a bad first visit.",

The Pad See Yew and Pineapple Fried Rice are also authentic and tasty. They have a numbering system of 1 to 10, but beware, 5 is incredibly spicy!  The bonus is you can bring your own wine or beer here, no corkage. I wanted to try their Mango with Sticky Rice but they were out. We ordered Fried Banana instead, but that was a disappointment. Guess we'll just have to come back for the Mango with Sticky Rice!",

The prices are terrific The service is friendly The parking is easy to find  What more do you need?   **Keep in mind, however, that this place aims to please all people, not just certain cultures.  In other words, there is definitely more flavor in the meals than you would expect and not as \"organic\" as one might find overseas.  Is it still tasty?  Of course, YES.**",

These were Pre-Yelp days for me. Apparently, barring spice level (a hard 8 is how I roll) my favorite dish: Massaman Curry with Soft Tofu is Misti's favorite dish and owner David was sure I was some under cover Yelper (when I'd never heard of Yelp!) It made for funny exchanges for a long time. David is quite a congenial character and cares about his business.   Definitive of  a Mom and Pop spot in every way; with a  small open kitchen where David's wife Lisa cooks up a storm. The fantastic aromas that fill the air are intoxicating. The owners are very friendly, passionate and if you've been to Thailand, Lisa loves to discuss regional food and travel. Luckily that led them to trust pale moi when I order a True Thai 8 level spice; many places take a gander at me and knock the spice level down. Not here!   The food is made with the same love that goes into running such a business, most of the time, David is your server. Small, no ambiance really. But Oh. That. Food. Three people can share a small feast for $10 or under if you eat family style. Since my bros would not TOUCH spice level 8 = I had enough take away for two more meals. Now that's delicious, nutritious and value packed eating! The Green Papaya Salad, Crying Tiger Salad, Drunken Noodles, Basil Rice are all standout dishes as well. Lisa will prepare any dish according to dietary restrictions/preferences.   It is on Durango in a non descript Strip Mall, near the now closed (again) Carmine's. Very easy to pass. Between Sahara and Desert Inn, the sign says \"David Wong's Pan Asian\" and faces the car park NOT Durango. I got lost going: but always get lost and was working on a three day insomnia hell. Just look out for it, and by all means: GO! You will not be sorry. Great to see such a True family business thrive: very Yelpy.   Yelp 100 Challenge",

I've picked up food at least 8 times and have never seen the place dirty, the kitchen is clean has never smelled like grease or anything foul. This is my favorite Thai place in Vegas.",

I think maybe I just ordered things I didn't like. It was my first time trying the noodles.",

Ordered the fried tofu and boat noodles. The fried tofu was really good. Others in the group ordered pad Thai with tofu, drunken noodles with tofu, mango salad, and the roti. All of the appetizers were amazing. The boat noodles had a lot of noodles so be aware of that. I could've shared that dish with the other person in the party and still have more than enough food. When the owner said a #3 is spicy.. he was right. I got a number 2 and it was already spicy. I can't imagine what a number 10 spicy level is. All in all a good place to go but it is a bit far from The strip. If you have time definitely check this place out.",

It's your courier who is messing up (Postmates/uber eats)   Las Vegas has a large handful of Thai restaurants and Pan Asian is the best of them all!! It is tucked away in a small plaza next to Fabulous Eyebrow Threading and Jimmy Johns. Drive slow or you'll miss the small sign.  GET: Pad See Ew: The Pad See Ew here is loads better than your avg Thai take out joint. The noodles are not soggy/clumped together but taste fresh.  Pad Thai: Pad Thai tastes the same to me everywhere but this Pad Thai is SO GOOD.   Filet Mignon Pho: Pho with a spicy kick and chunks of steak. This clears up my sinuses when I'm sick. One of my favorite variations of classic pho.  David Wongs Fried Rice: NOT your average fried rice. Comes with shrimp, chicken (not dry), and egg. Tastes like fresh fried rice off the hibachi grill at Benihana's (but better)  The food here seems to be made with a lot more care than most other Thai places. 5 stars, must try when you are in the area.",

Scant (3 small) shrimp and 6-7 pieces of chicken. All the right favors but heavy handed execution. Chicken and vegetable stir fry with black bean and ginger was the best of them all. I have to say that after reading all of the great reviews on Yelp we were very disappointed. To top it off, one app and two entree came to $30. Not bad if it was a quality meal but this owing one of those.",

I know every place makes them a little different so I will remember to ask for no mushrooms next time.  Also didn't care for peanuts in my curry either but that's just me.

We listened to the server about the spice levels, but next time will amp it up a notch.  Can't wait to go back again to sample more of the chef's creations.

The food is soooooo fresh and hot when it gets to the table, the flavors are fabulous, and David gives wonderful service.  I love the soups and every dish I've tried.  My favorite is the pad thai (with tofu).  Best pad thai I have had.  I will still go to Panna Thai once in a while because I like that style of Tom Yum soup, but I will be going here more often for everything else.  I haven't had room for dessert yet, but hopefully next time I'll have room for the tempura cheesecake.  My friends that I've gone with really enjoyed this place, as well, and they will be switching from their old go-to Thai places to this one.",

    "text": "yes, it's a one star and it's to stand against the five star reviews because I had the flip side of the coin experience.  we went in and the chef was in a frenzy because she was also the waiter.  I felt a little bad because 10 people came in the space of five minutes so, put her in an awkward spot.  I tried ordering an app the scallop one looked good and she told me she ran out of scallops. I asked if she could substitute it with something else.  I was told it wouldn't be possible because she was too busy between taking orders and cooking.  That seemed reasonable enough.  little disappointed but no fazed.  I ordered the chicken ravioli which is a misnomer because it's straight up chinese dumplings.  they were bland like the other yelpers mentioned.   I ordered the linguini and red curry.  I asked for the red curry spicy number one.  I got the linguini and it was too spicy.  She took it back and told me \"you should know basil sauce is spicy.\"   no, i didn't know I should know.    the male owner came by and said the same thing.  I told him he should mark it on the menu as spicy.  then he went on to say that each dish is authentic and they don't cater to americans.  that was the end for me.  but, the food?  the linguini that I had one bite of tasted like pad see ew with al dente pad thai noodles.  I don't get what anyone is praising it over.  I don't think using linguini noodles and keeping the traditional recipe categorize it as fusion.  the red curry was thin.  good flavor though.  i hate thin curry.    my experience went from mediocre to bad.  I'm not trying to bash the owners but, mediocre thai food plus bad experience is a bad combo.  The best thai still is komol, lotus of siam, thai place on washington and decatur (forgot the name) and siri (a great neighborhood thai place) in that order.",

We were still hungry and since one of us could not eat Wheat it took a while to explain we did not want soy sauce but they made the fried rice, without soy, fresh for us and it was killer. The bill was $12 for each w/o drinks and we were all full. I would of given a five except for the egg rolls. We will go back.

I have been going here for about a year now (2-3x a month), it is worth the 8 mile drive, their food never disappoints me.   I normally order basil fried rice, mango salad, Thai lettuce wrap, and fried ice cream. I have tried other dishes as well.   My only thing is the spiciness level.

    "text": "The family has been planning to come back since our visit Mothers Day.  I figured since I've been twice in a row this week, I should write a update.  I planned to have lunch with my mom and grandma in law and they were suggesting to come back. They wanted the Stir Fried Linguini and Massaman again. This was definitely a test in consistency and it was right on and just as good. This time the massaman had avocado pieces which made it even better for me! I also tried the Chicken Tom Khar. Lisa (chef/owner) came and said it wasn't coming out the way she wants with consistency since she changed and tried a different coconut milk. I thought it was still good as the flavor of the spices came through and made up for a lack of creaminess from the coconut milk.   I guess the BF felt shafted we went without him so we went for lunch the very next day. We had pork pad se ew which had a great flavor. The noodles were a little sticky, but I rather like sticky noodles than the usually greasy treatment of this dish at other places. We got chicken red curry. This is different than most reds I've had, less thick and a bit more watery but the flavor is much more complex. I loved the addition of eggplant and squash to this dish as those went well with the curry flavor. I love meat, but I equally love vegetables that are fresh so it's a big plus for me that the curries here isn't all sauce and meat. The BF and I had a good talk with Lisa about her food and a bit about their past restaurants and such. I loved that she said that since they don't have overhead they spend it on proper good ingredients because it's about the customers. That good food needs good ingredients to become a superior dish. If only every single business adopted that instead of cutting corners on ingredients they might have solid dishes and avid fanbases! And it's not like she is just saying that....we can see her cook and I see that their ingredients are quality (like our Thai Tea had organic Horizon milk) and fresh (herbs from their garden, fresh kefir instead of dried they obtain from LA, Melissa's produce). Considering the quality for the price, it is a steal of a meal! Many places charge about this much for much less quality.   I LOVE this place! It feels so comfortable to dine here with how friendly they are. It's like being in the Wong's home.   This is THE BEST Thai food I've had in the city and reminds me of some great Thai food giants in Los Angeles (if you didn't know- has the largest population of Thai in the US) solid Thai home cooking. I thought Thai Grill solved all my Thai food answers here in Vegas, but I think this has definitely bumped to my number one.  I rarely endorse a place this hard, but if you are gonna read any of my reviews and decide to go to a place, I hope I influence you to give this humble place a try.   A small UYE coming soon so check the calendars!",

One of my favorite things at this restaurant (so far) is the tempura cheesecake dessert.  They didn't have it the first time we came, so the owner surprised us with some free deep fried ice cream instead (also delicious).

We ordered the following:  Vietnamese Chicken Ravioli  Pad-See Ew Massamam Curry Crying Beef Salad Tom Yum Shrimp Tempura Cheesecake  The Crying Beef Salad was the best!  The beef was cooked perfectly and the greens had so much flavor.  Everything was delicious but I must say that I've had better Tom Yum at many other places.  This place only has a few tables and as this builds more Yelp cred, they will need to expand to counter the herds of people lining up.  Best of all, everything is under 10 bucks!",

There is no visual at all on the sign, and the font for \"Pan Asian is so default I thought it was for a tax or accounting company.  Thankfully, the food is everything but nondescript.  I have to say it was one of the better fusion restaurants I have been to.  I always feel nervous going to an All Asian restuarant because it seems none of the dishes are made right.  However, every single dish I had today was very good.  I had some crunchy pancake thing (I think it was called lati?) and the pad thai was pretty good.  I always order pad thai from thai restauarants and this place got it right, although the chicken was sliced a little too big.  PS. the desert was delicious.  Terri got this fancy fried cheesecake ice cream thingy and she shared it with everyone (happy birthday Terri!!).  I wish it wasn't so far from my house and I would definitely visit it more.  It's not a WOWzer restaurant or anything, but I had a good experience with the food.  Plus the old man working there is friendly and very funny.  I loved the service.",

She can make things off the menu if you know what you're asking for. Although I do not claim to be the specialist on Thai cuisine, you know this place is legit when Thai people (Sirintra my one Thai friend) love it.   Yay! I'm a fan, but I am not a fan of the decor and setting. It's rather confusing to eat exquisite dishes and then drink from a styrofoam cup. I think people will be amazed at the quality of food, but rather disappointed in the ambiance.  Seems harsh, but know what you're getting into before you get all dressed up for a nice date.",

    "text": "really enjoyed our meal here- we picked this \"hole in the wall\" Asian restaurant based on yelp reviews and it's close proximity to our house and we were not dissapointed. It's small and very casual but if that's what you're in the mood for- go here. The Tiger Shrimp & mango salad was delish! We were warned by the server/owner (?) that we should not order a high # for spice because it's not a cooked dish, it comes out really spicy. Holy crap, he was right. We ordered a 3 and it was SPICY and we can handle spice. So if you don't love spicy food- stick with a 1 or 2. We really enjoyed it though- if you don't like shrimp, it would still be a great salad without the shrimp- great portion size, 2 can share. We also ordered the Clear Noodles and the Basil Stir-fry. We were really happy with both of these entrees as well. 3 items was too much food for 2 people because the portions were generous so we had some to-go and no room for dessert. For 3 nice sized entrees and 2 bottles of water our bill was $32.   Note-they don't serve alcohol here and the server/owner told us, next time we can bring our own beer or wine. Overall: Really good experience- we will be returning and bringing friends for a good, inexpensive dinner.",

    "text": "Dined here with Tom R.  Food was good, had tons of flavor. Things we had:  Malaysian Roti: Not amazingly good, but I was impressed with how it turned out especially since the person that ordered it had no idea what it was. The contrast in texture between the crispy outside and chewy inside was very enjoyable and the sauce was quite nice.  Grilled Tiger Shrimp Mango Salad: Can't say I was too fond of this one. The shrimp was still raw on the inside, though for a salad maybe that's how it's supposed to be? The main detractor for me was the copious amounts of mango on it. The mango flavor overwhelmed everything else.  Singapore Noodles: Definitely one of the best dishes we had, was well cooked and flavorful.  Garlic Beef: Advertised as \"1000 times better than broccoli beef\" by the owner himself. Granted nothing can be 1000 times better than broccoli beef, it didn't disappoint. It was heavy on the salt and pepper, probably too salty on it's own for most people's liking but not me. Fortunately it comes with a side of rice that I highly advise you use.  Pad Thai: Perhaps the most disappointing dish. Not very authentic if you ask me. It wasn't sweet enough, was PINK, and had no peanuts. Nonetheless it was still pretty tasty, though it's pretty hard to make Pad Thai not taste good. The only Pad Thai I've had and didn't like was from Buffet @Asia.  Probably the worse thing about the restaurant is the lack of staff. There's one person that stays in the kitchen and cooks, and then the other triples as a cook, server, and cashier. When my water ran out, I didn't even want to ask for a refill seeing how bad the customer:employee ratio was. Seeing how Tom knew the owners and he's a regular, I hoped we'd get some sort of a discount.",

    "text": "D-licious.  Been wanting to knock off a few of my \"to try\" places, so I decided to hit Pan Asian.  Super friendly service from greeting to departure.  The menu is an interesting mix of various Asian foods, from Thai dishes like pad see ew to the Singapore specialty of Hainanese chicken rice.  We had the crying tiger salad, the special of duck with red curry, the volcano chicken and the glass noodles.  The salad was probably the best salad I have ever eaten.  It was fresh, a little spicy, had some texture to it and the beef was delicious.  The duck was excellent as well.  No gaminess or greasy duck texture, crispy skin and tender inside, with an interesting red curry with grapes, pineapple, cashews, and peppers.  The volcano chicken was similar to an orange chicken, but not as sweet and cheap like you are given in most \"Chinese\" restaurants that serve that **** for American tastes.  It reminded me of Dumpling Inn in San Diego and their orange chicken.  Good hunks of white meat, and good flavor.  The noodles were also tasty.  Several shrimp, with a good mix of veggies.  For dessert, we had the tempura cheesecake, which is just as it sounds.  A hunk of ice cream with whipped cream and a tempuraed piece of cheesecake.  Decadent and delicious.    Overall, a superb addition to the rotation and a great meal.  The gentleman who served us (the owner?) was awesome.  Super friendly and hilarious sense of humor.  The decor was also nice and the inviting.  One of the best restaurants I have found in a long while and we will be back...soon.  For 3 entrees, the salad and 1 dessert, plus a thai tea, it was $68 including tax.  The duck special was the priciest item at $22, otherwise everything else was around $9-$11.  For two of us, we could have made do with one less entree also, and I eat a LOT, so we could easily see coming in around $50 and being very happy for 2.",

I had a truly outstanding Masaman curry, and there was a great mix of casual and fine dining atmospheres.

The owners (husband and wife)  were very nice from the moment I walked in. I told them that I wanted my meal very spicy, and they didn't disappoint. This was a nice change of pace since most places I frequent usually don't deliver when it comes to heat. The chef - who is the wife - told me that when people ask for spicy, she gives them spicy. I love that attitude! The ingredients are very fresh, and the chicken was nicely trimmed of any connective tissue or fatty bits - which is another issue I've found all too common at other places.   I will definitely be visiting this place often as there is so much I want to try on the menu! I miss Mad Pita, which used to be at this location, but im hoping that Pan Asian lasts a while! Please, everyone, go there and try this place out. If you like Chinese, Thai, Japanese, or even Vietnamese food (really want to try the pho), I don't think you'll be disappointed. The prices are great and it wasn't busy at all when I was there for lunch,but hopefully that changes!",

I love not being overwhelmed and knowing that the menu is small because they things they do have, they do well and put a lot of care into.  The day I went they were out of the scallops appetizer. From the sound of it, I'm not sure they'll be having this around ever since it apparently doesn't get ordered much. Next time I'll definitely try the Vietnamese ravioli based on other reviews.  I went with my boyfriend when we were starving (which in no way affects this review..) and we shared the Pad See Ew with shrimp and the yellow curry with chicken. While we were waiting our waters were always kept full and shortly after ordering our food comes out. Oh my golly. The noodles were a little sweeter than I was expecting, but deliciously smokey and a little chewy with crunchy pieces of broccoli throughout.. perfect. The curry was on the thinner side which is to be expected, and was perfect over the jasmine rice that came with it. It's a curry done right.. I won't wax poetic on you.  There's not much to be said that hasn't already been said in previous reviews except this.. which I will repeat: Go there. Go now. Get happy.",

There is a delicious way to calm the volcano and that is fried ice-cream another way to justify the calories to cool the burn. I love this place and will be back many many more times. The only bad thing about this place is when I take my out of town friends and family there that is the only place they want to eat when they visit.

The negative aspect of this restaurant and my only complaint was the lighting and lack of privacy. Yes, the place is small so you have to sit relatively close to other customers which may be avoidable by dividers but not that big of a deal. However, something more pressing was the lighting. The kitchen is lit by big fluorescent lighting which takes away from the nice quint feeling a lot of Thai restaurants are offering. An easy fix but nevertheless an overlooked necessity here. My feeling was if the kitchen was separated with black out curtains it would provide for a more intimate setting.",

I ordered the Pad See-Yew with beef at a 5/10 spice level. For me, I thought this was supposed to be medium, but it wasn't spicy enough. Luckily, they bought over 3 different kinds of chili sauces and spices to sprinkle onto my food to make it spicier. Much better! The beef was cooked perfectly, and so were the noodles. The combination of the hot beef, and salty noodles is one that can't be missed!   My boyfriend ordered the Stir Fried Linguine with Beef. I know it's really odd for an Asian restaurant to offer linguine, but it was great. The noodles were cooked perfectly in combination with all of the vegetables. From what I tasted, it was a great dish.  I'll definitely be returning!",

Perhaps my expectations were too high???  Let me start with the positive.  Service was very personal and very attentive.  Prices were very reasonable.    The food was mediocre at best.    Chicken Satay was not very flavorful.  The peanut sauce looked like it came from a bottle.  The Ravioli app was okay.  The wrap was good and the presentation was great, but the filling was over-processed and flavorless.  The Duck Curry was good.  The curry was a bit runny.    The ribs were probably the best thing we ordered.  The XO sauce was really good but I felt that the ribs were overcooked.    The beef salad was really bad.  Poor slices of beef...some cut with the grain and tough to chew.  The salad looked like the regular spring mix that you pick up at the market.    The basil fried rice was especially bad.  This is a dish we get at all Thai restaurants and the entree we use to compare restaurants.  Theirs is heavy on the soy sauce and not very deep with flavors.

But the food is pretty good! i love how they have like chinese, vietnamese, thai, and whatever else kind of cuisine that i forgot.  And the waiter is sooo nice! Like moving-table- for-us-cause-we-were-a-group-of-10 kind of nice. And quite welcoming :) he asked us where we were from and if we made any money yet. Haha! We were all happy with the prices and they were very accommodating with a big group. No lunch specials on weekends though but that's a given! Good service tooooo!   Would come back here too! Try the pad see ew :)",

A bit far from our house but we went there because of the ratings. We ordered lots of foodand they're all excellent. 1. Appetizer, I forgot the name but it was scallops wrapped in banana leaves 2. Crying tiger salad 3. Grilled tiger shrimp mango salad 4. Seafood soup 5. Chricken rice noodle soup 6. Beef panang 7. Pad thai 8. Fried ice cream It's a husband & wife business. The husband was our waiter, really friendly guy and the wife was the cook who really know to cook good food. Overall, really good experience.I wish it is closer to my house.",

I sent it back nicely and told him that his pad thai is my absolute favorite and today it just isnt right... Well, he started talking to the cook and she got mad, said she didnt put fish sauce in it and that something is wrong with me because they make it the same way everytime. Ok. Then Mr Wong, takes it in the back and tastes it and proceeds to tell me that it must be me because it tastes fine and that maybe it was just too spicy for me. I have eaten the pad thai here over a dozen times now - I order it the same exact way everytime. So much for awesome customer service... I wont be back.",

Aside from the entrees which qualify for the $ rating (around $9, add another $1 for a small bowl of rice), our appetizer and soup were definitely $$$.  Shrimp Tom Yum soup for 5.95 was a personal serving size; we ordered two portions for the four of us, and it was two strips each of red and green bell pepper and a total of 7 shrimps (I should have asked if one portion would be 3.5 shrimps).    Curry and pad tai noodle were of good flavors, but beef was overcooked and the dishes are definitely not 4.5 stars standard.  Afterward we became convinced that because the merchant had a paid-advertisement on yelp that it had gotten bonus points by yelp.  Oh and, the place has an open kitchen, so you will smell somewhat when you leave. The first impression of it is a fast-food joint.",

For starters we got suckered into ordering the Roti.  Pretty tasty don't get me wrong but for pan fried dough with curry dipping sauce, I didn't think it was worth the price PLUS the oil intake i had to consume with it.  I can only take in so much oil a week and would much rather save it for fried chicken.  I had the crying tiger for my entree which turned out to be overcooked tough slices of beef drenched in strange spices in an attempt to make the beef spicy.  The beef was topped on a bed of lettuce and onions with absolutely no flavor at all except the overly used spices.  Friend ordered the curry which was mediocre but a bit on the sweet side.   SOO many great reviews, maybe yall should try it for yourself but beware of the crying tiger.",

I'm from Chicago and started my love of Thai food there. It was then cultivated in San Francisco for 10 years when I moved there for work. So, I would like to think that I know good Thai food. I ordered the pad sew ew and the massaman curry both with tofu and at level 6 of spiciness. The husband, David(?), said this would be spicy...is that ok? It was, and they both were delicious. The noodle dish is my \"go-to\" Thai dish and I tried this curry dish over my usual go-to, yellow curry. The reason I picked this one is it had potatoes and peppers (like yellow curry) but, it also had....nuts, cashews I think, and ..... avocados! Yum-I don't think I've ever had avocados in my Thai food before-it worked.  They have other types of Asian dishes but, when I saw the Thai stuff, had to try it. I would definitely recommend as it was really good and we need to keep these good mom and pop places going in this crap economy.",

And I searched the area for a good restaurant that is not expensive. I read the reviews about pan asian and got convinced to try it and with the $20 for $10 deal it sounds really good.   We got there and greeted by the owner, very pleasing and smiling all the time, felt very welcomed. It's fish Friday so I ordered mostly seafood. Menu prices are all less than $10 but when the food arrived they look so fancy and elegant. I was really impressed and the taste is very good, not your typical Asian cooking where it taste good coz of MSG ... this one, their food taste good because it's fresh and True flavors of the ingredients. My hubby who is not a foodie like me was very impressed too and could not stop eating and after each bite he literally say \"this is so good\" in each bite he takes.   Even if this is far from our house, we would definitely go back here and buy more of the coupon deal. Calamari is very good, crunchy breading that is just the right amount of coating. Pad Thai is amazing, not the usual yellowish flat noodles in other thai resto, but the flavors are so good together I can eat the noodles by itself even without the meat which means even if I order chicken or shrimp pad Thai I'm sure it will still be very good. Red snapper was very tasty and the sauce super good.   Owners are very friendly and inviting, I felt like I was eating at home with Asian family ;0)",

I enjoyed the atmosphere, so coming back was i thought going to be good again.  Well i ordered the mango shrimp salad, and when the waitress asked us how spicy, my husband and i knew better to ask what scale they used (we eat out a lot, especially thai!) whether it was 1-5 or 1-10?  when she said 1-10, we ordered it a 2! well when i recieved it, it was so spicy that i could no longer eat the rest of the food we ordered....i was disappointed but not mad.  i felt that maybe they did a mistake.  So i didnt make a fuss, but i did tell the waitress i was dying and needed water.  The waitress told the owner that it was too hot for me, so he said he would fix it,  But it was too late my mouth was on fire.  But this whole time, mind you i WAS NOT MAD, until the owner started to say stuff like it shouldnt be too spicy and that he didnt see anything wrong with the salad even though it was encrusted in red pepper,  and that i ate most of the shrimps so it must not be that bad!!  (it came with 3 fricken shrimps!!!) i started to feel offended by his remarks but still paid for dinner.  my point was not to not pay for our food.  i was ok until he started to talk.  Then he said next time to not order a salad with a 2! thats real spicy.  WHAT?????  then whats a 5 on his scale.  I just felt it had bad customer service and at this place owner is right, not customer.  To top it off the owner and his wife were yelling at each other while we were eating...... sad!",

This place had really good reviews on yelp and me and some friends wanted to give it a try.  The menu is kind of small but seemed like everything we ordered was pretty tasty and good.  WARNING: this food can be very SPICY!!... the waitress was super nice and warned us that their level 3 might be a level 8 for some other restaurants so we stuck to level 1-3 for our dishes.  It was still pretty spicy :(.  We ordered some tom yum soup which was pretty tasty but it seems everywhere I go it tastes different.  The main dishes were ordered were shrimp pad thai, duck curry, and chicken glass noodles.  This restaurant advertises \"fusion\" asian food and you definitely get just that.  The pad thai was good and spicy but tasted little different than pad thai i've had at other restaurants.  The glass noodles had a peppery, almost singaporean spice to it that had a very unique taste to it that was delicious.  The friends were a big fan of that! My fave was the special on the menu which was the duck curry!! oh yum!! There was soo much meat in the duck and the curry was so delicious!!! I'm just said it was a special and not always on the menu.  I'm not usually a curry fan, but this dish was very good and made my taste buds singing :).  There was also some different tastes including grapes and sweet garnishes in the dish that made it very memorable indeed.  The staff and cooks were super nice and attentive.  All the customers there seemed very happy with their dishes and most looked like regulars.  I will definitely try to come back again and try some of their other dishes, just less spicy!",

The Pad Si Ew was the best dish, well flavored.  The vegetables in the stir fry were not great and neither was the shrimp, green beans were tough and under cooked.  The Pad Thai tasted like they used sweet and sour sauce over noodles and the noodles were over cooked.  Pretty disappointing.  I will go back to Archi's for Thai.",

Lunch specials start at $6.99 and include pad see ew, pad thai, and curry. You will pay a little more if you want shrimp as expected. I tried pad see ew for the first time here and I am in love with it. The flavors are so developed and every bite tasted better than the one before. When it comes to spice level beware. Their spice levels here are at least two levels higher than normal. I usually get a 7 at Pin Kaow but here I find myself getting 4-5.",

The  rice was dark and unappetizing with bland and unpleasant taste and very dry. The curry was huge vegetables just rough cut and chicken was over cooked & dry.  All in all it was uneatable  Sorry,  my husband and I  know Thai food and this was A disappointment.",

    "text": "Visiting from Phoenix area and I wanted something fresh, healthy, close by, and a little spicy for me and yet still okay for my husband who isn't so spicy friendly.  This little place on Durango near our hotel fit our desires perfectly.    Firstly, it is clean.  It is always the first thing I notice.  This place is very well kept.    Secondly, you can see the kitchen so it is an open concept.  Be wary of a place afraid to show you their kitchen.  The smells as we walked in were wonderful and tantalizing.  Made me even hungrier and I was already hungry.  Third, we were greeted by the prettiest little girl.  Okay young woman, but to a 49 year old she is still a girl to me. :-) she sat us at our table and was our waitress.  She answered all our questions and gave me suggestions when I asked for them.  She was very helpful.  I decided on Drunken Noodles with Chicken (heat level 3 - thanks to another customer she suggested I go for a 3 instead of a 4 - so thank you Ms. customer for your suggestion - you were right!) and my husband ordered the garlic basil stir fry with chicken (heat level 2).  Their heat scale is 0 - 10.  Just to warn - their 3 is more of a 5 to me but I am a white girl born in Nebraska so take that to mean what you like.  Just saying, maybe ask for a lower heat then if you want more heat you can always add to it at the table.  Now for the taste!  My husband said it was the best stir fry he has ever had and he hands down loved it.  I tasted it and he is right - it was really delicious.  I loved my Drunken noodles with chicken.  The veg (green beans, red and green peppers, onions, Thai Basil) was fresh and cooked perfectly - hot all the way through with a nice crunch to it without being the least bit raw.  The noodles were perfect and the chicken was sliced thin and very tender.  The flavor was spot on great.    If we lived here I would make it a point to frequent this lovely little restaurant.",

I was dining solo, and on Durango so I figured  would take my fellow Elite yelper Shawn's recommendation for Thai. I walked into Pan Asian and was greeted and told to sit anywhere. As I went over the menu, I couldn't help but hear the table of 6 across from me talk about this place and \"their spice level\". One guy said how he won't go over a level 5.  If you know me, and spicy, I was instantly intrigued! I ordered some pot stickers (some of the best I have ever had) and the order of garlic and black pepper chicken, level 8. The boss/server guy looked at me and said \"here, level 8 is very spicy, not like other Thai\" I simply looked back, smiled, and said \"GOOD.\" When my plate arrived I could see the spicy. I started to get a bit nervous but then brushed it off. I was there alone, and I just told the boss I can handle it, can't wimp out now!  It was perfection! Yes I may have ordered a 2nd Thai iced tea, and my eyes may have been a bit watery at times. But did I finish it? YES. Will I order it again? HELL YES.  I love being the white girl who impresses the old Thai people. When my guy came to check on me he asked if it was too spicy, I told him it indeed was spicy, but perfectly spicy.  It's about time there is a place I can brag about to my friends when they want a real heat level. Good quality Thai food, and great service. I can't wait to return and try something else!!",

In Love- Beef Pho was ridiculously good, the broth was well balanced we ordered a spice level of 3 and it was perfect. Basil Fried Rice easily the best fried rice I've had since moving to Vegas it wasn't dry and it was full of flavor spice level 4. Pad Thai was delicious we ordered a 4 but ended up adding additional chili powder and hot sauce. We should've ordered a 6 or a 7 but once again the flavors were oh soo good.  Tried but didn't love it- Tom Yum soup spice level of 2, this could be just me but something was very bland about this dish compared to my local joint. Gyoza, don't get me wrong it was good with a nice crispy exterior and moist filling but it wasn't amazing. Massaman curry spice level 4 we added lots more chili powder once again this was a great dish but it didn't stand out amongst the many other times I've ordered it.   Side note- they were out of the mango sticky rice dessert.   Overall I will definitely come back to order my favorites here and I'm not scared to kick up the spice level next time either.

    "text": "My girlfriend and I stopped at Pan Asian for some sweet and sour chicken stir fry to go. We are new to the area, and we were told to go to another Chinese restaurant, but we found this place on Yelp and saw the incredible reviews.   The price was a bit more than I'm used to for picking up some Chinese, but we figured it was for quality and authenticity.   When we got in, the guy there was SO friendly. It was almost closing time, but he was so enthusiastic about helping us. He even set us up with water while we waited! At this point, I was thinking how this place is shaping up for a 5 star.   He asked about how spicy we wanted our chicken. I said I wanted mine a little spicy, my girlfriend said not at all. He asked \"0-10?\" And I said...6? He made a shocked face like, no, that's spicy! I remembered the reviews saying this place was spicy, and I said ok ok, 5. I like spicy foods, I eat them frequently, but I don't like to not enjoy eating something cause it burns. I told him \"not TOO spicy\" and he went off to make the food.   We were impressed because we watched him slice up the fresh veggies for the dish, and everything looked really good. We got home, and my girlfriend tried hers... Delicious! I tried mine... And I thought, huh. This is a 5!?!?  After a few more bites, my mouth was burning. Bad. But whatever, I usually like spicy food, so I figured it was right at the end of my tolerance. I was wrong. After eating some more, my stomach started to bother me, and it messed my stomach up all night. It was SPICY.   We were very excited to make this our local Chinese place. Although it was more expensive, it appeared to be fresh, the service was friendly, and we liked the atmosphere in the restaurant. However after this experience, I'm going to have to wait awhile before I go back.   I see other reviews mention this spicy thing. I generally love a place that is brave enough to make their spicy actually spicy. However, if someone is giving you a FIVE out of ten, it shouldn't be so hot it's difficult to eat. Using a scale like that is supposed to be a scale of what the average person considers 0-10, not what they do.... Otherwise it's useless.",

Not sure why it gets good ratings, so confused.",

The setup is kinda weird, the kitchen is open and basically in the dining room but behind a long counter.   David (the owner) greeted me and told me my order would be ready shortly (I called ahead.) I ordered the yellow curry chicken and added pineapples. I said I did not want it spicy and I am glad after reading all of the reviews because it seems like they are big on spice.   The curry had lots of veggies, red/green pepper, onions and sweet potato. It was different than what I am used to. The flavors were good, and I enjoyed my dinner. I probably would get the curry a little spicy next time, because the spicier it is the more flavor it has. I will come back here to try some other items.",

This past weekend my parents were in town and we let Lisa (David Wong's wife, and master chef) choose our menu.  We began with the Malaysian Roti, which is as delicious as it is beautiful.  We then had Panang Curry with Tofu, Yellow Curry with Chicken, Grilled Tiger Shrimp Mango Salad, Singapore Noodles with Chicken (my personal favorite, although the Yellow Curry gave it a run for it's money) and ended with some Fried Ice Cream.  My parents both agreed that it was the best Thai meal they had ever had (which says a lot since they are in their 70s and foodies.)    David and Lisa are lovely, friendly people who make an effort to please every customer that comes through the door.  It just doesn't get any better than this.",

We looked at a picture of the menu and decided on the Chicken Pad Thai, Pineapple Fried Rice and the Green Curry w/ Shrimp.  We placed our order over the phone as we wanted to utilize takeout and enjoy the meal from home.  I'm not sure if this altered the quality of the meal, but I think it has to.  I've NEVER had good Pad Thai takeout and this experience was no different.  Upon my arrival at home (10 minute drive), I opened the Pad Thai and it had a gelatinous casing like it was last night's Pad Thai.  I would have taken a picture but I don't think Takeout orders do justice for any establishment.  The Green Curry was OK, but they must be on the metric system w/ a high multiple as we ordered each dish w/ a \"2\" spice level.  They must have thought I said 20 because I was sweating after four bites of Pad Thai and a spoonful of Curry.    The Pineapple Fried Rice was the standout (in a good way) as the sweetness of the raisins and pineapple went well w/ the rice and the overall cook on the rice was on point.    The Green Curry was too spicy and overall was just OK.  I'm not sure if I would come back or not.",

Secondly I was in the mood for soup so there are two locations you can find them on the menu. I was told the ones under the Soup are \"appetizer\" size and the ones listed under Noodle and Rice are considered the large portions.  I decided to get the pork rice noodle soup and if you like pho and if you like garlic then you'll love the rice noodle soup they have. Broth was full of flavor, taste like it had fish sauce in it already. The roasted garlic complimented the ground pork and fish ball, yummy. My only complaints are that the sprouts were already in the soup when they served it, which made them partially cooked and less crispy and also, I found a lot of garlic skins in soup which I had no intention of eating.  Overall I was very happy with the meal for the price. It's a unique soup and I will come back to have more.",

Here I am, a lanky white guy, thinking I must have been Thai in a former life or something. Let me explain...  First, you have to try Pad See Ew. I know, if you're not familiar with Thai food it looks like something you'd scream out if someone threw up on your shoes...it's not. It's made with flat rice noodles, vegetables, and meat/seafood, I usually get it with pork or chicken but y'know, whatever floats your boat. TRUST me on this... you want to order this dish. It sounds generic, perhaps a little plain...yes, I know it does...it's not. In fact, when you do order this, you're going to want to punch everyone you know in the face for not telling you about it sooner.  Mr. Wong is the chef and he makes the best Pad See Ew I have ever had. I gladly sacrifice any chance at being in shape or watching my carb intake in exchange for the opportunity to shovel this stuff into my mouth hole.   The restaurant is tiny, laid out weird and you can't help but watch what's going on in the kitchen as they prepare your food. This man is all about the fresh ingredients and quality food. I haven't had much else on the menu but it could be the one item and I'd be just as happy.",

    "text": "Le Thai : Hip, Downtown Eatery :: Pan Asian : Made with Love, Family Kitchen  I heard good things about Pan Asian and finally got to try it out when I was on this side of town.  It's in a little strip of buildings, next to nothing in particular and we almost drove past it.  When we got inside we knew it was our kind of place: small, homey feel with super friendly owners.  I don't need some stuffy restaurant on The Strip- give me a place like this any day!  After being told they could make many of their menu items vegetarian, we decided to let them call the shots.  I wanted a curry and a noodle so David (I think that was his name) said we should get the Massaman Curry and the Stir Fried Linguini.    The curry was made with veggies and tofu and had a nice flavor to it.  My husband and I both enjoyed it.  I only wish that it had a little more spice (we ordered medium) and some more veggies (it looked a little soupy, even for a curry).  The noodles had a good amount of heat (also medium), lots of flavor, and were packed full of fresh vegetables.  I was actually pretty surprised at the amount and quality of veggies I was given.  This was my favorite dish of the two.    We also ordered a Thai Tea and Fried Ice Cream.  Both were good, but I have favorites elsewhere.  In all, I felt like I was invited to someone's home for dinner when I was here.  The owners are very warm and want to make you are as happy as possible while providing great-tasting and comforting food.",

The interior design of the restaurant is very nice and the menu is very large with lots of options. The Malaysian Roti was made to the right texture and it was super delicious. The Chicken Satay was so moist and perfect! The Mango Salad is the best here, they are not stingy. The Filet Mignon Noodle Soup was really good because the meat was very soft. The Pad Thai was not my favorite though, I was actually disappointed, it's not bad, but it didn't stand out to me. Lastly we had Fried Banana w/ Ice Cream, and I didn't like it because there was coconut flakes in it and they use plantains and so it wasn't very tasty, I like it sweeter. But it was okay because David gave me extra fried banana because he said I was too skinny, haha! Overall, this place is a really good thai restaurant. I wonder why not that many people know about it.

I met this hot chick hitchhiking who had a coupon and so we had dinner together.  We tried the tiger shrimp salad with mango and Thai Linguinewith shrimp -mild-.  VERY DELISH.  The owner is very nice and I swear he needs to be a bit actor on Hawaii Five-O.  Finished up some fried ice cream and we were content.  Nice vibe to the place even though I would prefer an upgrade to the seating furniture.  I would recommend.",

Not even a little bit if spice, barely any flavor and the pork was just as uninteresting. Neither the noodles nor the pork had flavor or seasoning or anything. It was a little cold and very bland. I also ordered the Thai iced coffee, now I've never had thai iced coffee, so I have nothing to compare it to but it was gross. That could just be my own taste buds. I still wouldn't recommend it. It was a complete waste of money and I'm extremely extremely disappointed. I wish I ate at the restaurant so I could give it back and get a refund. I'm sure the other food might be good, but NOT the pork pad thai.",

    "text": "A majorly delayed review, I have eaten at Pan Asian at least 6 times since it opened and I have to say, if you want a noodle dish, go with the Thai Linguine with vegetables. This dish is one of the best looking (and tasting) bowls of noodles I've ever experienced. The pasta is perfectly al dente and the dish is wok seared in a light soy-sauce with spice level dialed to request. The veggies are bright and fresh: red/green bell peppers, white onions, sliced tomatoes and asparagus. This is THE dish to crave, and Chef Lisa describes it as her 'favorite' as well. First-timers are making a big mistake not ordering this one.   The woks are perfectly seasoned at Pan Asian. No weird aftertastes from cheap sesame oil or five-spice here. This is something to take note of anytime there is a wok involved.   Do the right thing - GET THE LINGUINE, spice level 3 and you will be good to go.",

They were very attentive and friendly.   We started off with the Fried Calamari and Wonton Soup. The calamari was cooked perfectly and was breaded with panko. I had never seen that done before but added a great crisp to the dish. The Wonton soup was amazing. The broth is well developed and delicious. The dumplings were juicy and tasted great!  For entree my fiance got the Rad Nah Noodles and I got the Drunken Noodles. I tried her dish and it was awesome. The vegetables were cook well and not soggy like you find in some restaurants. It was a play on Beef and Broccoli but way better. With the Drunken Noodles I got them with Shrimp. The server let me know their restaurant is the hottest when it comes to spice level. I got 5/10 since it was my first time there. OMG SPICY! The noodles were perfect, shrimp great flavor, but it was incredibly SPICY. The server was awesome though, he saw how I was struggling so was diligent about filling my water. I jokingly said to him to just leave the pitcher and he did! Which worked out well for me because I never had to worry about waiting. Great service!  My only issue with this restaurant is they don't serve any alcohol. Perhaps that was a good thing since I was chugging the water!",

The curry was amazing, although their 1-5 heat scale is hotter than you expect, if you like 4, get a 3 possibly, the owner even said something about them being a \"spicier thai restaurant\".  overall 5 stars because of the experience and the amazing food.",

We've tried a number of dishes here so far including the duck curry, the Malaysian yellow curry, and the Singapore noodles with a variety of proteins (chicken, shrimp, duck and tofu) and all have been outstanding.  The duck curry is a particular favorite, it is one of the best dishes I've had anywhere. Appetizer wise, the Malaysian roti is amazing and the calamari was great as well.   Service was outstanding every single time. The owner (David) is a super friendly guy. We enjoyed talking with him a lot. Just great folks here overall really.  And keep in mind, when they say spicy, its freaking spicy.  Its not like some places where you can order a top level spiciness and skate buy, they don't play around here (to quote David).  He warned me that the level 8 would be hot and it sure as heck was.  Just amazing.  Even the level 3 was hot for my mom.  I think I got the 5 on later visits and it still had plenty of kick.    In any event, this place is a real gem and everyone should eat here.  Its that good.  We plan to be back frequently!!",

Service was good, but nothing exceptional.  Price is good for the main entrees.  I only gave it three stars as the their spiciness scale is crazy! We love spicy food and normally order closer to a 7 or 8 on the 1-10 spicy scale. We got a 4 on the Pho and a 6 on the pad thai and both us could not handle that spiciness. A little fair warning would have been nice.   The restaurant is on the small side, but is comfortable and clean.   We will be back, but will order something less spicy and will try some of their more authentic dishes.",

We chose the roti for an appy and the crispy duck (today's special, $19.95, probably one of the priciest items on the menu).  The roti came with a lovely curry sauce, more sweet than spicy.  Our duck was lovely, crispy, and meaty.  Accompanying the duck were three sauces: curry, hoisin, and mango (my fave), along with stir-fried bok choy, steamed rice, and tortilla wraps.  I'm so glad I shared the duck, as portions were generous.    David came by several times to refill our water glasses and to admonish us to \"share our food.\"  He also looked at my husband valiantly nabbing julienned slices of carrot and told him: \"don't waste the food.\"  :)  The restroom was spotless, definitely a great sign for a restaurant.

Today's visit? The same horrible server (female with a ton of makeup, not the Asian girl) screwed up my check. She WAY over charged me for my lunch. When I asked for a new check because the amount was wrong, she argued back that it was correct. So I did the math for her, rounding up:  $9 (Panang curry chicken lunch) + $8 (chicken satay) + $3 (Thai tea) = $20 plus tax, but she charged me $38.75. I was dining alone, did she really think that was correct?!? So she fixed the check, but then I tried to pay and they didn't have any change. I should have just walked, but I turned my purse inside out to get the payment, informed her I won't be back, and left.   The food is not the issue here. Please hire competent employees.",

She also left (as in went home) without telling us and we waited for our check for about 20 minutes not knowing she took off. Not cool.

    "text": "Where do I even begin with this review? I mean, I suppose we could go in order and start with the shrimp spring rolls along with the chicken and rice noodle soup that we ordered as appetizers. Everything was fresh, flavorful and fulfilling. The service was beyond attentive and Jolene, our server, was a delight. She made our first visit one that will be followed with many subsequent returns.   The Beef Pad Thai at a 2 had a kick to it that might as well have been a 4 or 5 at other places, but of course, that's subjective. You might scoff at my weakness for anything spicy; I'm a timid,  quasi-white guy who can't handle a few drops of Tabasco let alone a 5 or 10. However, if you're daring, ask for a 30. YES. A 30! I imagine an inferno could ensue within your stomach causing you to squeal with every bite, therefore if it's your first rodeo, do everyone a favor and don't be that person who wants to impress everyone in the restaurant. Dial down the spice and enjoy the meal as is.  Finally, what really made my head whirl in ecstasy was the Ginger Black Bean sauce served with Jasmine Rice. Beyond delicious! All-in-all, we had a great meal and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. Definitely coming back!!",

The beef was good and tender, there were plenty of noodles, and despite clearing out my sinuses, the broth was sooooo good. Like I said, I'm craving it as I type this. We will definitely be back!",

    "text": "Thai style Asian food.  Unique flavors found no where else.  This is one of our favorite go-to mom & pop restaurant for the family.  Simple reason, and our son sometimes want stir fried noodle plates and other times get food envy and end up eating our entrees, we have to like most of the dishes on the menu in case he gets adventurous when he orders.  The spice scales here is serious!  Do not, under any circumstances, ever get beyond a spice level 4.  Trust me I'm Asian and I know these things.    My favorite dish:  Beef Pho Noodle soup, spice level 2, with extra slice beef.  It is pho noodles, but the cut of beef is slightly different than Vietnamese pho and the spices are more Thai style too.  Husband's favorite: Fish Pad See Ew, spice level 3.  The sliced fish is deep fried in a seasoned batter before being mixed into the plate of noodles.  It has very good flavor and adds texture to a plate of soft flat rice noodles.  If your kid eats spicy, get them spice level 1 here.  If not, don't just ask for zero, tell them your kid can't eat any spicy food.  Service, seat yourself and be patient as they do a lot of take out orders.  Chef Lisa is the chef owner along with her husband David.  Food is obviously the best when she's cooking in the kitchen and when David is working the front of the restaurant.  We've been there when neither of them are there and food / service drops to about a 4 star.  Highly recommend this for another who's looking for Asian fushion.",

If you come at night, the ambience is glaringly lit with fluorescents. This is a typical hole-in-the-wall asian eatery, lacking decor and using paper menus.   Service is a bit overly attentive and with a smile, and it's not to their discredit but I don't think they understood anything we said. We received the wrong check, but got our water refreshed every 3 minutes, which was necessary with how FRICKIN HOT their food is.   I ordered the Beef Rice Noodle \"Pho\" bowl ($8), and my boyfriend got the Massaman curry ($10). When asked if we wanted it hot (which we can usually handle in restaurants that practice humanitarianism) we said \"medium,\" thinking we'd get something palatably spicy but not \"hot.\"   I couldn't physically eat my meal, as it was laced with so much chili oil that my throat literally felt like it was bleeding and my lips were swelling up. My boyfriend went through multiple napkins for nose-blowing, excused himself for the restroom, and continued blowing his nose. I drank at least 2 liters of ice water during my meal. We swapped meals halfway through to diversify the flavor-pain experience.   For the good of your clientele, if a Caucasian person asks for \"medium,\" just nod and give them \"mild.\" Or explain the impending doom that's about to occur. Anything, please. Please god.   Why three stars? I could tell that underneath all the chili oil that the food was actually very tasty. In the moments where I wasn't thinking about running into traffic, the meal was actually very enjoyable. I would return, with a strict MILD ONLY PLEASE, and probably have a better time.",

It was mediocre and tasted like how it should - I got the Pad See Ew and cousin got the Basil Fried Rice - 3 for spicy level was too spicy and he likes bit of a kick, so probably stick to a 2 or a 1, he was sweating bullets throughout dinner.

The crispy duck curry is a savory thai curry shimmered with the sweet pineapple and grapes, sometimes with lycee to balance out the spiciness, while the duck are fried super crispy. Its such a great dish. Although, really watch out their spicy level. When they ask you your spicy level, keep in mind they are thai standard spicy, not amrrican standard. Go level 3 if you want mild to medium, I had the level 5 and its burning me inside out. But i am still swallowing more food with my sweat. And the mango salad is a slightly cooked salad, which I love.  I would say avoid their tom yum soup, they are alright and serve in bowls then pot. And tried their pork rib, they are favourable but too meaty for me.   Overall it is a very good thai place out in the desert and even better than those in town. It is out off the strip but really worth going and to be away from the crowds and lines.",

Well... that turned out to be too good to be True. 1 hour after I submitted my order, I decided I better contact the restaurant. I called 3 times - no answer. Finally I used the Eat24 message feature to check on the status. Ryan was very helpful! He was able to contact the restaurant and get an update. He removed the tip (because the restaurant certainly didn't deserve one,) and he credited my order. My food was delivered shortly thereafter.  Pan Asian service - 0 stars Eat24 service - 5 stars  The food... I ordered the Filet Mignon Pho and the Black Bean Tofu Stir Fry, both of which were soooooo spicy you couldn't taste anything.

    "text": "This review is for 4.5 stars.   If you're looking for a spicy dish that is well made, come to Pan Asian. Usually at Asian restaurants when you ask for extra spice they just throw more peppers on the dish. Here they actually prepare the spicy level and cook with it so the entire dish has a nice level of heat. I ordered an 8 for chicken pad see ew and a 5 on the massaman curry. If you can handle heat, then 8 is just a nice buzz of spice; 5 isn't much.   It won't make you sweat but your mouth does have a nice paralysis after eating. Stomach will be fine but you'll know you just had a spicy meal.   The curry was just ok but the pad see ew was excellent and actually a bigger portion than I anticipated.  The entire meal came to about $22 which is about average, maybe a few dollars too much. But based on location And the spice, I am very happy I came by and tried Pan Asian. I will be back for pickups in the future. I wish their menu had more selection besides protein, noodle/rice, and sauce, but I think I can keep trying new dishes happily in the future.",

We told her that we were sampling and wanted to stay away from deep fried.  The Malaysian Roti we ordered was deep fried , dripping with oil not even close to the recipe of Malaysian Roti.A Shocker.   I suggested that the chef put on menu that it is a deep fried dish.

    "text": "I've been meaning to come here for a long while now .. and I did! TWICE even before I decided to write a review!  Pan Asian is quite a quaint place. It's not a huge establishment -- it's actually quite tiny. It has about 5-6 tables only so if it gets busy, it'll be real busy.   The first time we went, I decided to go with their stir-fried linguini which had asparagus, tomatoes, bell peppers, garlic, chili, basil, and your choice of meat. For me, I decided to choose chicken with it. I guess you could say something like, \"That's not a thai dish!\" \"What?! Go to thai restaurant to eat non-thai dish?!\" Psh. Don't be a hater. And I have to say that ... it was not a bad decision at all to order the dish.   You also get to choose your level of spiciness for your dish. The range goes from 1 to 10. On yelp, there is this tip from Roger that you have to go spicy or go home. So guess what I did? I chose level 10. No, I didn't do it as a challenge or for \"fun\" -- I mean, who does that for fun anyways? Let's set fire to my intestines so I can laugh while it's happening. I personally love spicy food therefore, I gotta go spicy or why am I even there?! The server was nice enough to warn me. She asked if I've ever eaten there and that their level 10 is really really spicy. I will not back down! You will not scare me! I still went for a level 10. Then a little bit later, the cook himself warned us about the spiciness of level 10. I love you guys! But give me my spicyass food!!   The linguini .. was delicious! It had a very interesting and different flavor to it. I do believe that he uses satay sauce to stir fry the noodles and with the spiciness of the peppers, it was delicious. I just love how it's not huge chunk of pepper flakes in my bowl. A lot of other thai places will tell me to get a lower level of spice and if it isn't enough, I could add in pepper flakes myself. Gee, that just means one thing. You use pepper flakes to cook your food instead of using actual peppers.   My friends, on the other hand, ordered curry and pad see ew. The curry didn't really catch my attention when I tried it. Their pad see ew was really good though. Very good aroma. Though, for pad see ew, I would probably suggest not making it spicy. It doesn't really do it much good.   As for the second time we went, I was thoroughly surprised that the server remembered me. We decided to try out their tiger prawn shrimp salad and the server goes, \"What spicy level do you want? 10?!\" I was surprised but I laughed. She remembered me! I guess not a lot of people order level 10 there. But I eventually settled with a level 5 for spiciness. I know.. I know.. LEVEL 5 ONLY?! What! Why didn't I level 10 that !!?? Well, for one, salads are a completely different story when it comes to the spiciness level. It's almost doubled ... plus, I was sharing the dish with my friends. I'd rather not send them to the hospital with fiery intestines.   The dish, however, was delicious. A level 5 was the perfect amount of spice. It gets that fire in your mouth going. The prawns they used also did not taste like they were frozen shrimps. They tasted pretty fresh and the way they lightly grilled them on the side was really good. Really yummy dish and I think it'd be perfect for summer!  As for my entree, I decided to go with a pad thai at level 10. I opted out for the peanuts and carrots cause I don't care for pieces of peanuts in my noodles and I just hate carrots. The dish was very good, but, I don't think it's better than the linguini in my opinion. There was nothing that sets it apart. It's a tinge of sweetness and I think because of the sweetness, it's not as spicy as it could be. Though, it is a progression of heat so as you heat, the hotter it gets. It's the best kind of spice :D !!!   The only things keeping me from giving Pan Asian five stars is because I'm thoroughly confused. When reading the menu ... you kind of question yourself: is this a Thai place? A Vietnamese place? A Chinese place? etc etc. They have a dish or two from different Asian cuisines. They even have hainan chicken! What the??   The second thing is their thai tea. WAY too sweet. It had no tea flavor. No go!   Overall though, it was a delicious experience. And I definitely will go back.",

More than once we were feeling like those needy customers but she was a delight the whole time we were there.  We would return just because of her.  Then we got the food, which was ALMOST as excellent as Jolene's service.  And the price for the amount of food is a great bargain. We will be back, thank you all for the wonderful dining experience.

We had the calamari for an appetizer and it was so tender and fresh, not a bit chewy at all...... The Filet Mignon Pho was delish! Flavor was really great! Lots of tender filet noodles and super spicy just like I wanted!  My husband ordered the Duck w/Curry sauce. I had saw this dish on Yelp and my husband was excited to try it. When we were looking over the menu I couldn't find it anywhere. The waitress said 'oh yes we have it',  I am not sure why it isn't on their menu????   I saw so many dishes I want to try........ Singapore Noodles.... Pad See Yew...... Drunken Noodle...... ALL look amazing!!!  I love spice so I ordered a spicy level 5 after the waitress warned us that their food was on the spicier side. (I usually get a 6 or 7) The spice was perfect for me! Compared to a lot of other Thai places though, be aware they are on the spicier side of that 1-10 scale!",

    "text": "Unbelievable! I am kicking myself right now for not reading the most recent reviews of this place! They all agree with me, appalling taste and upsetting execution.  How is it possible that every single dish we ordered tonight was an awful and tasteless disaster! They must of hired a new chef. That's the only explanation for this. Pan Asian, how do you go from having a near perfect review on yelp and start to slip this drastically? Everything was beyond unacceptable. You have been checked off on my list of the worst thai food I have ever had in my life.  First offense: The chicken pad thai was an unnatural pink? The chicken looked like dried overcooked salmon - it was pink! The noodles were beyond over cooked to the point where they were hard, all stuck together in blocks and then broke up into a million of little pieces when you would try to pick them up. There was no sauce at all, not even soaked into the pad thai noodles. It was so dry! So crazy dry. There was no flavor at all - not even a hint of fish sauce, sweetness, sourness, or anything!   Second offense: The pad see ew with beef noodles were also stuck together like bricks, dried out and hard. Also, why did the only flavor we taste was oil and extra black pepper? Did they run out of oyster sauce, sweet soy sauce, sugar, fish sauce, all of the traditional ingredients that go into this dish? I could not handle eating oil flavored noodles with extreme black pepper. Into the trash it goes.   Third offense: The green curry with beef had the consistency of tom yum soup. I don't understand how they can make a curry so watery! I did not taste any of the deep flavors you would typically find in curry, (no lemongrass, no richness, no sweetness) except for spicy. Spicy water would best explain this dish. To add insult to injury, they offered us a minimal amount of chewy beef pieces and loaded up on undercooked and hard vegetables. Cutting costs much?  What upsets me the most, was that the owner David Wong was there and he allowed these dishes to be served to us. That was his stamp of negligence. There is no quality or control here.   We ate 4 bites and could not get past how incredibly shoddy all of these dishes were prepared. I'm seriously upset that we spent$40 on all of this dried out, bland food. The joke is on us. I would typically give restaurants a second chance. But not this place, never again.",

I will say that while I would prefer to go to Lotus if it were the same distance from my house, Pan Asian is some of the best Thai food I've had in the general Summerlin area. The restaurant is small and modern but doesn't seem to get particularly busy. Ate a few things:  Gyoza- pretty good, very crunchy and freshly fried. Linguine- very flavorful and filling. Don't be fooled by the Linguine it's no Italian dish it was very much Thai flavored just with an unusual noodle choice. Tempura Fried Cheesecake- lol I mean obviously this is gonna taste awesome but it's execution was a little off. The closer you get to the center of the cake the colder and harder it becomes since they basically just battered up the cheesecake and dropped it in the fryer. Would still eat a million of them though.  Priced reasonably well, around 10 dollars an item. I chose spice level 5 and it definitely had a good amount of heat to it. Will be returning until postmates or seamless let me get lotus every day instead.",

The food here is some of the freshest and most authentic Thai I have ever had.  The cook does a wonderful job of using the freshest vegetables to make each dish.  The flavor in each dish has been fabulous.    Today I had the Red Curry Duck and the Pad Kee Mau (Drunken Noodle).  The Red Curry Duck was amazing.  They use an entire duck breast cut into slices and they lay it across the curry.  It was amazing and full of moist juicy duck.  Well worth the price!  I also love the pineapple and grapes used in this dish.  I always get it very spicy, and the sweet mingles with the spicy just right every time!  I also had the Pad Kee Mau (Drunken Noodle) dish.  I asked for it spicy so she added some red peppers to the dish and it came out wonderful!  The heat level was perfect for me.    When I go to a Thai restaurant, I ask for the dishes Thai style.  This is one of the places where she will actually make the dish as \"Thai style\" as it gets.   If you want authentic Thai that is fresh, delicious and at a good price, give Pan Asian a try!",

I definitely would recommend Basil Sauce ground pork, mild spicy at 3. Miso soup was to perfection! Masaman curry was so delicious, try it at 3 cus 4 was already spicy hot. Lol. Loved the experience, I am glad we found this cozy place!!!",

The Massaman curry is amazing. With big chunks of sweet potato and buttery avocado, \"It's the best Jerry, the best!\" Spicy #7 is ALL I can handle. They do 1-10 on the spicy scale and we're talking serious heat here. If my Thai food doesn't cause a runny nose, I don't wanna eat it. David Wong's does the trick every time. If you order spicy #5 at your usual Thai joint, you probably wanna cut that down to about a #2 at Pan Asia.   If you LIKE Thai food, try David Wong's, and you will LOVE Thai food.",

Not because their food isn't yummy (It IS!) but it is an incredibly small place and on more than one occasion, we had to go elsewhere because they had no more room and others already waiting. Which is a total bummer! At least that says something good about the food though,eh?  The food is really good, fresh and a great value for the price. (Enough for dinner and leftovers) However, be very careful about the spice scale, cause it's nuts. My hubby usually gets like an 8 at most places, but he got a 4 here and it was BEYOND spicy. Like, he had to throw it away cause it burned so bad kinda spicy. I got a 1 cause I'm a wuss and it was perfect :) Other than that, they are super friendly and I really hope they increase their seating capacity, cause we enjoy eating here!",

I went there on a Thursday evening and the restaurant was empty, the owner took my order and the food was pretty good. I also received good service and refilled my drink without asking. I had the coconut shrimp as my appetizer, a nice large shrimp dredged in coconut flour then fried to a golden crisp. I also has a small bowl of filet mignon pho which was quite tasty with really good flavored broth. My main dish was garlic pepper shrimp with vegis, it was good but for me the coconut shrimp and the pho was the star. All three dishes including and ice tea was $30. I did notice some cheap lunch specials there between 11am to 3pm.",

    "text": "What brought me to this place which is about 7 miles west of the the Strip, was a Yelp deal I stumbled upon.  $10 for a $20 gift certificate?  I'm no fool, but that is a great deal!  My hubby and I dined here for lunch on Saturday, March 3rd.  Since we were the only ones dining at the restaurant at the time, we had the choice of sitting where we wanted to which was nice.  This place has a real mom and pop shop type of feel to it. The gentleman who waited on us (I think he may have been one of the owners) was really friendly and helpful.  My hubby and I ordered their Chicken Satay, Garlic Pepper chicken and their Grilled Tiger Shrimp Mango Salad and hot tea.   CHICKEN SATAY:  I loved how they used white meat chicken for this.  It was moist, juicy and flavorful.  The peanut sauce tasted fresh and was delicious.  The best peanut sauce ever!  The cucumber relish was also very fresh and complimented this dish very nicely.  GRILLED TIGER SHRIMP MANGO SALAD:  OMG!  A MUST ORDER!!!!  This was probably one of the best Thai style salads I have ever had.  It has baby greens, cashew nuts, mango, red onions, sweet peppers, Asian herbs and chili lime dressing. I loved how it combined the sweetness of the mango, with the spicy, tanginess  of the dressing.  Definitely a flavor match made in heaven.  According to our server, their dressing is homemade.  DAMN!  I wish I could take a bottle of it home!  A warning though, we ordered a spice level of 3 for the salad and the heat sneaks up on you!!  LOL!  Though my tongue was on fire, I could not stop eating it as it was that GOOD!  CHICKEN IN GARLIC PEPPER SAUCE:  Another winner.  If you love garlic, then this is definitely a dish for you!  Full of flavor and just plain yum!  Again, I loved how they use white meat chicken in this dish.    HOT TEA:  Very good.  It has a unique, floral taste to it.    FINAL VERDICT:  WORTH THE DRIVE FROM THE STRIP!  GREAT FOOD, GREAT PRICES (WAY CHEAPER THAN ANYTHING ON THE STRIP), FRIENDLY SERVICE AND CLEAN ENVIRONMENT!!!    Can't wait to come back!!!  :)",

Sadly, I wasn't that impressed and several members of our group went home that evening with stomach troubles.    We tried a variety of dishes and the ones that really stood out to me were the Malaysian Roti and the Tempura Cheesecake!  The roti was crisp and not too greasy.  The curry sauce on the side was full of flavor but I wished it was a tad thicker.  I didn't expect the cheesecake to be as good as it was - the batter was light and the cheesecake was nice and tangy.    Some other dishes we got were: shrimp salad, fried tofu, basil fried rice, pad see yew, and panang curry.  IMO everything was on the salty side as I feel like I had a gallon of water while I was there.  None of these really stood out to me.  I've had better versions of all these dishes elsewhere.    Restaurant was nicely decorated (really like the open kitchen so you can see what the chefs are up to) and service was top notch.   Maybe I just had such high expectations because I've heard so many good things about this place but it most definitely did not live up to expectations.",

While fluorescent lighting isn't my preferred ambiance for dinner, the food and David's ceaseless sense of humor far outshone the lighting.    We brought a started bottle of wine with us, half-full because we didn't want to polish off a whole one, which we knew we could, and would. He promptly brought us wine glasses, and when he noticed us skimming ice out of our water glasses, he brought us a big glass of ice with a spoon.  Service was like that consistently.  We shared two entrees - the Musulman Curry, with Chicken, and the Stir-Fried Linguine, which for once I was able to convince seafood-challenged hubby to allow me the pleasure of ordering with shrimp.  I loved the addition of sweet potato and avocado to the curry dish; both blended perfectly with the sauce.  I would have loved it even more if it were a tad less sweet and one star higher up the spice ladder.  The linguine was terrific, and I reveled in the rare delight of having Asian food with - omigod - shrimp!  But alas, the shrimp was tasty, but was missing that crisp \"bite\" that should come from wok cooking.  The veggies, especially the asparagus, had it, but not the shrimp.   Still, it worked!  We left happy and full, and we'll be back soon.",

Pleasant presentation, complex flavors.  The owners are very kind and take great care in making sure the customer has a good experience.  One last thing:  be careful with the spice levels.  I had to convince Mr. Wong into letting me have the panang curry at level 5.  It was probably the equivalent of a 7 or 8 at other places in town.

We came here for Sunday lunch on the recommendation of my friend and I was definitely not disappointed. The prices are reasonable and the selection of choices have your usual favorites of Thai food. The waiter warned us as we were ordering about the spice level (from 1-10)...we were told to get about a 3-4 as that would be spicy enough. It had a good kick and after eating the entire meal, I could feel the spice, but it was not overwhelming. I can only imagine the burning of a 7-8. HOT STUFF!  We got a nice selection of food...started with the Crying Tiger (Thai Beef Salad)...we were asked how much do we want to cry (spice level). We didn't cry that much. And for family style entrees to share around the table, we ordered the Red Curry (chicken), the garlic pepper stir fry (pork), and the drunken noodles (beef). All had a nice amount of spice and really good flavor.   I'm looking forward to the next time that I will venture up to this area to try some of the other dishes that they have to offer.",

The tender wontons are stuffed with chicken, shiitake mushrooms, celery and served with a sesame sauce. After devouring those we couldn't wait to dig in to our entrees. I had the drunken noodles. I like spicy and ordered a 6, after the owner warned an 8 was too hot. They don't mess around with spice here. I like that. Flat noodles, tossed with a perfect blend of seasoning, tomatoes and green beans. My husband must try the sweet and sour chicken at every new place we try. This version was a bit lighter than the usual, no thick breading, just chicken stir fried with pineapple, bell peppers, onions, tomatoes and cucumber. I am anxious to return and start eating my way through the menu.",

    "text": "What a wonderful hidden gem that is family owned and run. We came once YEARS ago and had an excellent experience. Unfortunately, we moved much further South and wasn't as nearby anymore. On Valentines Day, after a morning filled with Pokemon Leagues & Gymnastics, we ended up here with our 2 crazy kids around 2PM. It was surprisingly full considering the time and our server seated us very promptly. We went kind of crazy on the ordering considered there were only 2 adults & 2 children (8 & 4) but we definitely left extremely stuffed.  We started with the Malaysian Roti with curry & crunchy shrimp spring rolls (per the request of my son). The Malaysian Roti was great! Puffy, fried roti with a wonderful curry that had just the right amount of seasoning. We will certainly order this again. The spring rolls were typical egg rolls IMO served with lettuce & sweet & spicy sauce. Onto the entrees! We got: drunken noodles, panang curry, crying tiger salad, & basil fried rice that had shrimp & chicken. Everything was excellent. My favorite was probably the crying tiger salad with its tender fall apart beef. I think what makes this place stand out is that they cook their proteins PERFECTLY. Barely anything has to be chewed because they all fall apart in your mouth. I wish their panang was slightly thicker, but the flavors were excellent anyway. Their basil fried rice had a bunch of basil leaves in it (my favorite herb) and made me happy. Drunken noodles had plenty of veggies which is just the way I like it.   For dessert - fried cheesecake & mango sticky rice. Both were typical but still delicious. Overall, come try this hole in the wall Thai restaurant. You won't be disappointed with its cozy interior and family run service.",

We really wanted to go for dessert but since we both ordered a second helping of rice we didn't leave enough room :(  We'll definitely come back!  UPDATE: I've been here a couple times and after some evaluation, I say their Thai menu is definitely A+ their \"other\" items however can be a hit or miss. I've tried their linguine and I wasn't a fan. This restaurant's cuisine is Thai to begin with so I don't stray anymore. They do have one of the best curries in town !",

I pulled up to the location and was almost scared off by what I saw from the outside.  It's not much to look at, but I told myself that all these positive reviews had to be for  a reason.  I'm glad I didn't leave.  Everything I had to eat was full of flavor and cooked wonderfully.  On several dishes they ask you how hot you would like it, from 1 to 10, everyone in my party stuck at 5 or below and trust me that was a good thing.  Unless you like really hot stuff a 5 is plenty of heat!  We shared a serving of the chicken wraps and I had a bowl of Pho, both of which were very good.  For the entree I had a duck curry, which came loaded with vegetables and I decided to go with 5 on the heat scale.  My mouth was on fire by the time I had finished, but it was a good fire!",

The owner broke a glass but rather than freaking out or getting flustered, he quickly took a drink order and then cleaned it up.   One other thing with mentioning is that it's very reasonably priced! Two meals and tea came to a grand total of just $20!",

I hate vegetables, as my +1 Michelle (I will refer to her as this throughout the review because she refuses to open a Yelp account, but had a blast with me at the CYME) can attest to, but Pan Asian is the exception!  After reading dozens of 5-star Yelp reviews, I developed a craving to try Pan Asian.  When we pull up in the parking lot we are a bit taken back by the fact that we are the only ones here.  We enter the restaurant and it is empty.  During our entire dinner only one patron came in to pick up a to go order and I have to admit... it scared me!  First off is the Gyoza.  Fancy name for potstickers.. with flavor and texture!  This app came out inside 5 minutes!  David (of David Wong's Pan Asian) was waiting on us and discussed, in depth, the ingredients and its masterful cooking process.  The Gyoza had True texture, something I look for in all foods. At first bite it was crisp, then soft, and then an influx of flavor.  Our app was in front of us for probably six minutes then it was devoured.  I was actually criticized by my +1 for eating the garnish.  I did not know it was not acceptable to also eat the carrots that were artistically placed on the plate.  Party foul on Rich.  Almost immediately upon our successful conquer of the Gyoza, our main courses arrived.  +1 ordered Clear Noodles and Beef, I had the Basil Sauce Stir Fry with Beef.  As previously stated, I am not a veggies guy.  To be blunt (#YelpConfessional) this is my first stir fry... in my life.  The flavor was disgustingly good!  I was gobbling up bell peppers like there is no tomorrow. The onions were perfectly seasoned, the... whatever else was in there... perfect!  Truly, absolutely, perfect!  I agree with Tien's review.  How can food possibly taste this good?  No explanation here!  Michelle's meal... wow!  I was offered a taste, which I could not resist, and it was just as impressive!  I have never been a huge noodle guy, but for every rule there is an exception... this was it.    My (our) biggest dilemma was the amount of mouth-watering menu choices and which we would eat.  We will be back (multiple times) and I cannot wait for the next visit.  As usual, the balance of Yelp is not wrong.  This place is freakin' awesome!  A True treat to eat, and the prices were incredibly cheap!  Gyoza, Clear Noodles and Beef, Basil Sauce Beef Stir Fry, 2 drinks... $28!  I have told 3 people about this place since dinner!  Don't miss out!",

The second time we visited we order the Seafood Soup and the Crying Tiger Salad. The owner also suggested we try the Vietnamese Style Chicken Wings (which was not on the menu). Once again, the squid in the soup was excellent--very tender. Overall, I'd recommend this place to my friends if they want an alternative to Archi's, Pin Kaow or the like but within the same price range. I'd also recommend finding the Yelp deal that I did: $10 for $20 worth of food. Also, I'd like to mention that the Owners are very friendly and remembered us from a month ago when we first visited.",

When we pulled into the parking lot there was only one car there and we were not sure they were open, even though the sign said they were. We tried the door and were greeted my David( the owner) with a warm hello. He welcomed us and told us about how he came here from Naples Florida and just opened a month ago. He assured us we would love our meal and he was right. He made a couple of suggestion and we settled on starting with the Vietnamese Chicken Ravioli. We watched Lisa, David's wife and a wonderful chef, prepare the appetizer from our table. It is nice to see an open kitchen where you can watch everything being freshly made. For dinner I had the Red Nah noodles and my wife had the Massaman Curry. Both were outstanding, although I have to take my wife's word on the curry since I don't enjoy curry. The portions were good size and we even had a little left to take home. My only trepidation about writing this review is that Pan Asian is a small restaurant with only about 14 seats and I don't want to always have to wait in line for my new favorite local place. My other recommendation to David was for him t o make sure that Lisa's name goes on the name of the place as well since her food is the real star of the show.",

    "text": "The food was pretty good, i gotta say the Malaysian roti thing was really  good specially the sauce but i have had it cheaper at other places, Then i had basil fried rice which was one of the better ones I've had, being a big Thai food fan. My friend also got the Thai linguine which was good but nothing to be too excited about. My favorite was the Pa cha with thilapia that's a must have. Unfortunately the duck was off the menu that day so might be back to try that another day. I have to say price vise i have had cheaper Thai food at few other places just as good as this, but this is one of the better place. I think most of the food is Thai based even though it says pan asian, except for the linguine, ravioli, roti and few other stuff.",

    "text": "I have a friend who like to eat good food as much as I do.  So when he recommended Pan Asian to me I agreed to give it a try.  It is a 25 minute drive from where I live to the restaurant, I have to drive through Chinatown to get there.  Its worth the drive.   David and Lisa are husband and wife and the owners of the place.  The kitchen is open so you can see exactly what is going on.  It is very clean.  They will make you feel like family.  David makes it a point to know everyone by name and the next time you come in he will ask about the people that were there last time.  The food is top notch I have eaten at several Thai restaurants including one in town that is a favorite on the food network channel, there is nothing that is close to the quality of food that Chef Lisa prepares.  She will vary the heat according to your taste.  I like an 8 on most things, in the soup it is a slow heat that builds.  She uses fresh Thai peppers and they do not release their heat immediately, so be careful.  I normally order one of the soups to start an entree and then dessert.  The Fishball and Beef Noodle Soups are both excellent.  They are always asking us to try something new, that isn't on the menu.  The Red and Duck Curries are incredible.  Each of the ingredients maintains its individual flavor and yet they all work together.  Sometimes they have a Key Lime Pie in a small cup it is yummy.  Maybe if I mention it enough people will ask for it and they will have it all of the time.  It is the perfect compliment to the spicy food.  The Sticky Rice with Mango and sesame seeds is very nice.  There is a little bit of sea salt that accents the warm sticky rice and the ice cold mango with coconut milk. If I find something that I don't like I will let you know but so far everything that I have tried I would eat again.  it is getting tougher to get through the menu as I go back to what I have eaten before.",
