The ribs which are what they are supposedly known for, must be just a mass market gimmick. Gave this place a chance... but there are much better choices in the Vegas area.",

The waitress was horrible and even forgot the extra dressing for the salads . When asked about it we got a reply of \" oh yea, well it should have enough on it\" and still never got the dressing. When it was time to pay we were told to go up front since they were busy and could not ring us up. Then when we asked the bartender to ring the bill he told us he was not part of the restaurant and go over there as he tossed the bill back. When we were leaving thinking this was 2 hours we lost and won't get back guess who's standing out front handing out numbers to people and taking names . Yes the Manager . Not the hostess or another employee but the man who should be watching and making sure the customer service is being met. Tony Roma's really needs some help and all 8 of us will never go back!",

    "text": "So I have never been to a Tony Roma's before, I thought they were a decent chain steakhouse.  Boy was I wrong.  I was with my wife on Valentines day and went towards the end of the night.  The wait was reasonable given the day. We were sat in the back by the host who sat 2 tables at a time, efficient, I liked that.  So our server (Mariella) took a bit to come over and when she did she was very short, not friendly, and just wanted to get our drink order.  We were trying to ask her simple questions about the special, which she didn't seem to happy to be answering (I suppose she assumed we were cheap, which is fair, but not True by any means).  You could tell she was in a hurry and wanted to get this over with.  We ordered drinks, but if she would have given us 30 seconds we could have ordered our whole meal, saving her another 5 minutes.  She brings the drinks (wine) and takes the order, 2 regular priced steaks ordered medium rare. Well this was about the last time we saw our server.  The steaks came out in a reasonable amount of time, but were over cooked.  All the sides were cold.  We weren't going to have them recooked (as I normally would an over cooked steak) but the side could have been addressed.  Well she never came back.  I had to stop a male server to ask for the sauce that was on the menu which she did drop off, but did so in a sprint and did not ask us anything about our food or if we wanted more drinks (which we did). So we choked down 2 horrible steaks.    The whole time I could see my server doing side work 4 tables away.  This is unprofessional in several ways, reflects poorly on the server but also that the company is having them do so much side work rather than have other hour employees roll silverware.   I heard her trying to give away tables because she was trying to get out of there, which sucks that she would give such bad service then dump them on another employee to take sales and tip outs on horrible service.  Mean while, we were pretty much done at this point and had already had our card on the table for 10 minutes, which she would have known, if she EVER stopped by.    When she was finally done rolling her silverware she came by and asked if we wanted more wine (we did 20+ minutes ago) and still didn't notice a credit card at the edge of the table.  I had to hand it to her and tell her to close us out.  We almost just left without paying seeing as no one knew that we were there.    Needless to say, this is the only time I have never tipped, even bad service and rude people still get 5-10% out of me seeing as I worked in the industry for 15 years.  I will make sure all my friends and family that visit me never go to this restaurant when they are in town.  Do not go to this restaurant, keep walking down the street, there are plenty of good restaurants a block down.",

I would definitely recommend if you're a carnivore.  I ordered Babyback ribs and chicken combo. I guess I didn't read the menu thoroughly enough; but I was expecting a breast of chicken and got the leg and thigh. Not my favorite part of the bird. Without any problem or questions, the server had it switched out in minutes. Tony Roma's at Fremont Hotel truly made me feel like a king tonight at a time where I am over working myself and needed a great American style Hearty meal. Plus being downtown in a casino with SO MUCH history is pretty cool. I love having a close circle of friends. I want it to get larger! Come join me!!!",

Located inside the Fremont Casino on Fremont Street of Las Vegas you can't not see the huge pictures boasting the $8.99 Prime Rib Special.  After 9pm you can get a $12.99 Steak and Lobster special, but that was way too late for our hungry tummies.  There was a small line at Tony Roma's and the hostess passed out paper ticket numbers instead of the traditional write your name on list.  Much to our surprise the hostess rattled off numbers faster than a machine gun, often calling 6 parties at once.  For a split second I thought what is this, are we all going to sit at a cafeteria style bench?  I guess TR's gets about 1000 customers a night so they are really set up be fast and efficient.  We were seated quickly in a nice booth.  Again much to our surprise our waitress was fast and friendly as well.  Furthermore the helpers clearing tables, getting drink refills and bringing out food were all fast and friendly something I really didn't expect on a blue light special meal.  Of course we ordered the prime rib which came with steamed veggies and a small baked potato.  The portions were good sized and tasty.  The night before we ate at Lawry's House of Prime Rib and although TR's prime rib is not comparable it was still moist, tender and flavorful.   Although I wouldn't recommend Tony Roma's for any special occasions if you want a great deal on Prime Rib this is the spot to go.",

After we were seated, the experience changed for the better. Our server was prompt, attentive to detail, and light hearted even though it was obvious he was overworked.  Steak came out wrong, no big deal...they were HAPPY to take it back and make it right.

We waited about 20 minutes, killing time in the casino. After getting seated, we were quickly greeted and our orders taken. So why only 2 stars.  For a place like Tony Roma's, I expect a bit of quality control when it comes to cooking their meat and plating. I ordered the steak and lobster special and when it was served, the vegetables looked like they were just thrown on the plate and the steak looked like it didn't rest very much as there was a giant pool of liquid under the veggies (could have been from the veggies too. Not too sure). The lobster was cooked alright. Nice and tender, but for some reason, was missing that richness I love in lobster. The steak on the other hand was a total miss. I ordered it medium rare and it came out decently cooked, but was all kinds of dry. It was actually pretty hard to stomach. But what can you expect for $11.99. I feel like they're just pumping out steaks so QC isn't as high as going to a normal Tony Roma's.  My brother got the ribs and they tasted like the ribs you'd usually get, so do yourself a favor and pay a little more and get the ribs and not the steak.",

Then, Maya complained they couldn't walk through, and tried to put the chairs back. After that, I lost all patience and said we don't fit! I we need a bigger table or the 2 seater table right next to us. She said she had to ask the hostess, and finally the hostess put the other table next to us, not my own server..

Well, what did you expect for $11.99 right... small portions of everything. 8-oz steak was small and rubbery but the 5-oz lobster tail was delicious with lots of butter. Two bites for me. I didn't eat the house veggies as it didn't look fresh and appealing. The meal also came with baked or mashed potatoes. I think bread was served also before the meal, I can't remember.

    "text": "Allow me to jump over the food review and skip to the end of my visit to where I was surrounded by security guards, the restaurant manager, and the casino manager. They were ineptly attempting to figure out how to handle an irate customer (me). As you can see, this was not a pleasant experience at a well-run establishment. Nope, it was a horrible evening at a piece of shit crap factory. Now back to the beginning...  THE ORDER: I ordered the ribeye with garlic mashed potatoes, garlic green beans, and added a lobster tail. My wife ordered the same, except with the sirloin. One daughter had a sirloin, and the other had a chicken panini with soup.  THE QUALITY: My daughters' meals were alright. The lobster was alright. The mashed potatoes and green beans were alright. My steak and my wife's steak were NOT alright. The ribeye was ALL FAT. Okay, that's an exaggeration. I was able to find approximately 4 bites on it that I was able to eat. The rest was fat, and I could not eat it. I have attached a picture of it. I understand that ribeye is a fattier cut of meat. It is one of my favorites. It is the cut I get every time I eat steak. This steak was not a cut that should have been served to anybody.  My wife's sirloin was inedible due to chewiness. I don't have a picture of hers, but just imagine a piece of meat with 5 bites taken out of it, and all 5 bites spit back onto the plate.  THE COMPLAINT: I asked a server to speak with the manager. About 4 minutes later a guy walks up, and asks what the problem is. I tell him that my ribeye is inedible due to the amount of fat. He simply says, \"okay\" and walks away. The table of 4 just seated next to us overhear this and ask about the bad steak. I show them my food and they are immediately interested in the goings-on.  THE ESCALATION: About 3 minutes later the pompous Japanese manager reappears and says, \"I will remove the lobster from your bill\". I pick up the uneaten steak and say, \"How about you remove this from the bill. I can't eat it\". He goes into an explanation of how they receive the meat and cut it there, and the cut you get is the cut you get. I then pick up the steak and tell him, \"You need to tell your cooks that when they pick up a cut of meat like this, do not cook it. Throw it out. Do not serve it to a customer\". I said \"This piece of meat is shit\". He told me if I speak to him like that, he is going to leave the entire bill with NO reductions and make me pay the whole thing. I say, \"F*#$ YOU\". He says \"Okay, here's your whole bill. Pay it\". I place it on the floor and tell him \"That's where it's going to stay. I'm not paying it\". He says \"I'm going to call casino security\". I tell him \"Alright\". The table of 4 just seated next to us witness all of this and get up and leave, saying that they can't believe a restaurant would treat a customer like that.  We watch the pompous Japanese restaurant manager walk to the hostess booth and use the telephone. A few minutes later two guys from casino security show up as well as the casino manager.  THE RESOLUTION: My wife decides to jump in and save the day. I take our daughters and stand in the lobby area in order to remove myself from the situation. My wife listens as pompous Japanese manager tells casino manager that I devoured all the food on my plate, then screamed profanities at him in an attempt to get a free meal. None of that is True. She walks the casino manager to our table and shows him our plates of food. He then instructs the restaurant to remove our steaks from the bill and tells my wife that I am banned in the future.  THE VERDICT: This restaurant is a fine establishment with excellent food and an extremely courteous staff is what I WOULD say if it were True. Unfortunately, this is a piece of crap excuse for a restaurant serving garbage on a plate with a staff who make Hitler look like a fun play date. My wife says she would have rather dumpster dived for her meal. DO NOT EAT HERE. I can't emphasize that enough. DO NOT EAT HERE. But DO stop in briefly and tell the pompous Japanese manager \"Hee Haw\" because he is a total donkey. I will send a special gift to anybody who goes in, says \"Hee Haw\" to the pompous Japanese manager, and reports it on this review.",

Went in last night and ordered. Sat at the bar as always to wait. Virtually no one in the place but was totally ignored by the bartenders.    My wife always gets the same thing...potato skins and mozzarella sticks.  I think they're meh, but she loves them, which is why I go there. I always get something different...last night I got the ribeye, which I've had before, but last night was kind of blah...tough and flavorless. Hey, I love their ribs, so will continue to go, especially since the Mrs. likes their skins.",

    "text": "Went to Vegas with the 'rents over Veteran's Day weekend.  The Cal and Main St. were all booked up for a Video Poker tournament, so we flipped our comp'ed room over to the Fremont.  The second night in, we ended up eating at the Tony Roma's for the Prime Rib special.  First off, Tony Roma's is pretty busy.  We had to wait 30+ minutes for a table (and this was at 5:30pm).  The decor is very dark and while there are a lot of patrons, we were all pretty spread out.  All three of us ordered the Prime Rib special (since that's our thing to do when we go to Vegas).  It comes with a baked potato and mixed vegetables.  I didn't try the horse radish, but the waitress and my parents said that it was very strong.  The quality of the meat was about on-par with the Market Street Cafe, but maybe a bit less juicy.  It was okay, nothing too impressive.  What I really missed in comparison with the Market Street at the Cal, was no rice and there really wasn't that much au jus.  Instead of the free cherry jubilee (at the Market Street), we shared an order of the dessert sampler.  This is where Tony Roma's regained a star.  The sampler consists of a red velvet cake, apple tart with ice cream, and a brownie with ice cream.  In one word: yum.  I enjoyed all three of the dishes tremendously and they definitely did not scrimp on the portion sizes.  All in all, if the line is too long at the Market Street Cafe, I wouldn't mind coming back here for some prime rib.",

The food tastes pretty much the same as any other Tony Romas.  The wait staff was attentive and accommodating.  The ribs were great (4 of us had ribs), and we added their red hot BBQ sauce, which made it yummy.  My mom had the prime rib special and she was happy.

Then, they gave us a table in a dark little corner where my family of 5 had to fit. After I said I need a bigger table that's not so cornered they gave me a booth that fits 4 and when we said that's fine we will just add a chair and sit here they said no sorry we can not do that. So they called the manager which was extremely rude to us and she said you guys can sit in your original seat or wait 35 minutes for a bigger table, we should have left but we were starving so we went back to the little corner and fit somehow. The girl who took our order of drinks was very nice and sweet, but when I asked her where our waitress is she showed me the lady behind her and the lady said I'll be right there and just walked off. She came back and forth a few times and I said excuse me but she ignored me. When I finally asked the drink girl to call her she said I'll be right with you again and walked off once more. When she finally came back she rudely took our orders as if she was in a hurry and left. The food was stale and hard to chew and small portions. The container they gave me coleslaw in was what they put your hot sauce and salsa in at Robertos Tacos. And their soda tasted like tap water. Anyway I can't believe this was a spot in Vegas the service was that of some foreign starving country or something. Never go here save yourselves! I didn't eat much I just asked for s box and took the food home to my dog. Nice $125 dog food.",

Yes, the pricing is cheap here, but as the saying goes, you get what you pay for.  I will say that our server was nice and she made an effort to do a good job.

Our server told us about the $8.99 prime rib with veggies and baked potato. The bf went with that and I chose the St. Louis Ribs sampler. Our food came out in 5 minutes. The prime rib was nothing special it was small and bland, the veggies were from a can and the potato was a potato. The ribs were very tender but the sauces all tasted the same. Fries were warm. Everything was just warm like it was already made and sitting under heat lamps. I swear we were in and out of there in 20minutes fastest meal ever! Will not return.

Upon arriving at Tony Roma's inside of the Fremont Casino we had to snake all the way towards the back of the casino and saw a line waiting for Tony Roma's special.  Little did I know the term 'special' was las vegas local slang for \"stupid tourists, come to me, come to Tony Romas and freely waste your time and money\"  I knew better, my wife and mother in law they gave it a try.  I went with the buffalo chicken sandwich and fries and a bowl of the french onion soup.  The soup was ok, but the sandwich sucked and so did the fries.  I waited for the steak and lobster arrive and when it came, I laughed.  I've seen shrimp larger than the lobster that came with the steak and I've also seen shoe leather with less gristle than the steaks that came out.  Lesson learned, if you want really sucky food and really bad service, come get tortured at Tony Roma's.  We even had a lady pass out and be taken away by the paramedics while we were dining at Tony Romas.  I wonder if it was a trick to get out of the bill.",

Set inside Binions (I think) it was busy, but we played some slots while waiting. Surprisingly, we were able to hear our number over the casino noise. Anyhow, let's get to the important part. We both opted for the $11.99 steak and lobster, medium rare, which is the deal that brought us in the first place. Now I'm not going to try and convince you that it was the best steak and lobster we have ever had, (It wasn't) but it was pretty good and came with a giant potato and veggies and hit the spot for our particular needs at the time. Service was fine and it was clean enough. If you ever find yourself hungry downtown, check it out. I'm pretty sure you won't be disappointed, unless you're expectations are to get a $100 experience for $11,99.",

I'm not sure how full the other Fremont restaurants are during these times, but these specials are so popular, the Hostess gives out #s from 4:30-5:30, then stops ~ & from 8:30 till 10pm.  My Lobster was very good but the Steak was chewy.  I ate the Lobster 1st, so it was late in the game when I cut into the steak.  Should have sent it back, but my friends were almost finished with their meals.    Ribs are a favorite item ~ my friend's order was tender & juicy.

The prime rib we ordered was medium rare and it came out just like we asked.  If you looking for a basic meal, this is definitely what you will get, that's why I'm giving it a 4 star review. Don't expect anything fancy, basically a simple dinner.   Service was good, it was super busy due to the prime rib deal. But we got our drinks and food in a timely manner.

At the time we were there, most of the customer around me were eating the same thing but they crank out the volume pretty well.   The staff is very friendly and they were on top of our drinks making sure the ice tea's, coffees and waters were all filled. They brought out a big basket of rolls and there is plenty of butter on the table.   We got our plates fairly quickly. I will say that I have seen some pictures of steaks on this Yelp post but my steak could fit in the shadow of those steaks. I will post a picture and you be the judge. Actually worst than the size was the fact that my was pretty dry; however, when I looked at my Father-in-laws steak it was perfectly pink in the middle.and he had asked for his well done. I think they switched our plates. Too bad I ate my steak first then went after the lobster while he did the opposite. By the time he saw the inside of his steak, my was in my belly. Damn it.  Even with our little snafu, this is still a great deal and we all left very happy. There are much better steak and lobster plates in Las Vegas  but I appreciate not spending $100 on a plate. For a good deal, you cant go wrong with this special.  Its so nice having so many offerings in 200 yards or less. These are not the fancy upscale restaurants on the strip, these are the common  guy/gals place. It allows you to have a nice meal, see some great entertainment and still go play a little.",

The ribs were cooked perfectly literally falling off the bone. But the original sauce was mediocre. I asked for a side of Makers Mark BBQ sauce and it was a tad better, but really not that good. My wife found a few bones in her chicken sandwich, I guess that means the chicken is real. Service was terrible, seems like their philosophy was quantity over quality.

I finally got up and approached a manager and asked if we had a waiter coming. He said \"I'm sure you do\" and turned around. Strike 1.  Our waitress finally arrived. She said \"what does everyone want to order\" she took our orders and walked away. We didn't see her until she brought put food out 45 minutes later. Completely out of water she never attempted to refill. Strike 2  We ordered the 11.99 steak & lobster special, chicken fingers & fries, bacon Mac & cheese, and the rib sampler. My fries were actually as cold as the ranch. The best thing that was ordered was the Mac & Cheese. The steak & lobster were so rubbery it was unbearable to eat. Now we weren't expecting much for this price but I didn't know steak could possibly have this type of consistency. Strike 3  We were never asked how the food was, our waters & beers were never refilled &  even after seeing the majority of food still on all the plates our waitress never thought to ask if everything was ok. I'm not sure if they just thought we were tourists but we are actually locals and all in the service industry. And to top it off the gratuity was already added... Insanity.   When we were leaving I expressed my disappointment to the manager & all he did was smile & say \"have a nice night\" And to top it off after expressing these feelings a few of the servers were laughing & highfived .   I will have a nice night because I now have the knowledge to never return.   PS I am a bartender downtown & will tell everyone I know to keep far as possible from this establishment.",

Well, it was absolutely delicious, an 8 oz serving with veggies and a baked potato.  We also has the sirloin steak, at regular price, with an added lobster tail, and both of them were also out of this world!!  Steak was done to perfection (medium-perfect pinkness inside!), and melted in our mouths, and the lobster tail was not rubbery at all, as lobster tends to be if not cooked properly!  Our waitress was nice as could be and very attentive.  The wait at 5:30 on a Friday was about 1/2 hour, which we expected so no problem there!  We will definitely go back again!",

It was busy because they had the steak as lobster. Long story short. First plate : hair in the food second plate: missing lemon asked the waiter for lemon. He was cleaning the table next to us with gloves on and a rag. He never took his gloves off, he went to back and brought the lemons with the same gloves. Gross. We told the manager, food poisoning Is really real. The manager made us pay for our appies and said sorry. In theory the appies should be free as they made us wait an hour n every where else was close.",

My friend ordered the steak and lobster for $11.99, the waiter told us the deal started at 9pm...we needed to wait another 15 min. We ordered the kickin shrimp...it was soggy and looked disgusting. We sent it back.  Then some Maxwell Smart looking dude came to our table...not to discuss the shrimp order we returned but to inform us we could not be seated before 9pm to order the lobster special. We got that resolved by the manager. My friends steak which was ordered medium rare was well done. That was returned to get the same thing. Finally, she said she would try to eat it...we just wanted to leave.  As she was cutting this dry tough steak, it flared to the ground.  You do NOT want to go here",

We ate at the Las Vegas-Fremont location on 8/28 for dinner only because we were invited by our friends that LOVE this restaurant and make it a tradition to go here when they visit Las Vegas.  There were eight of us.  It was about 5:30 and not crowded.  We were seated in a few minutes. Service was fair.  Server was courteous and efficient. I ordered the Baby Back Ribs Tony Roma size at $19.  Got cole slaw and a baked potato. I asked for spicy sauce. The ribs were below average and not very meaty, sauce was not spicy at all.  Baked potato and cole slaw was fair. We were given some bread.  It was dry.  The butter they offer is not butter but very small \"Promise\"  margarine containers in a basket!  Are you kidding?  It took me about five containers for my baked potato and two for my roll. Butter should be on the plate in a container with the sour cream(got this).  Margarine should be an option for those that don't use butter.  In summary, Tony Roma's is a below average overpriced restaurant.  There are many other restaurants in this city.  Don't waste your time.",

They were understaffed, the meat was over cooked, and they even managed to mess up the baked potatoes.  In over 20 years of coming to Las Vegas, this was undoubtedly the worst meal I have ever had in the state of Nevada.  Tony Roma would be rolling over in his grave if he knew how bad this place was.  And if Tony Roma is still alive, eating at this place would probably give him a heart attack and that would put him in his grave.  Then, he can roll in it.  Seriously, this place was truly awful.  If you look at most of my reviews, most are very positive because I enjoy going out. But this time, I felt compelled to spread the word and warn others.  The buffet in the Fremont Hotel and Casino is much better.",

Announcement calling out names for tables at Tony Roma's.  As we were passing the entrance, I noticed the sign for the $8.99 Prime Rib Dinner Special.  We looked at each other and said why not!  It was a very popular special so we had a 10 minute wait.  However, once we we were seated at our table, immediately water and menus appeared.  We both opted for the special and ordered after our waitress delivered our glasses of wine.  Within seven or eight minutes, our Prime Rib Dinner Special was placed before us.  It came complete with Baked Potato and Steamed Mixed Vegetables.  Au Jus, Creamy Horseradish and sour cream was also provided.  It was done perfectly, medium-rare, juicy and tender!  For $8.99, fast friendly service at a table and all while spending only 40 minutes time, Tony Roma's beat any Fast Food counter or Coffee Shop.",

    "text": "You know, I'm REALLY not a fan of big chain restaurants, but while strolling Fremont Street, we got hungry and were lured in by the $11.99 steak and lobster special (only available after 9 pm).  I didn't go into the experience with very high expectations but came out pleasantly surprised. It was 9 pm,  and we still waited about 25 minutes for a table as the place was very busy.   You don't get a pager or anything, they don't bother to take your name, but rather give you a paper number (like you get at a busy bakery).  They skipped us, but when we brought it to their attention a few minutes later, they apologized and sat us immediately.   The food came out almost faster than our wine from the busy bar, and as I said before, I was pleasantly surprised.  I was expecting a hockey-puck steak and a rubber piece of lobster, neither was the case.  I ordered my steak medium-rare, it came out more medium but not big deal (my dinner companion also ordered medium-rare, and his was perfect).  The lobster was cooked perfectly and was a decent sized tail.  All of that came accompanied with a baked potato and mixed vegetables (they were frozen, machine chopped mixture of peas and carrots  liked you'd buy in a grocery store). Overall, for a late night snack that's more than a burger or hotdog, it was worth it.  Just don't go into it with huge expectations and you'll have a memorable experience.  This place turns out food like a factory, keep that in mind and you'll find it to be alright too.",

I've experience better.\", but factor in the price and service and it really was A-OK (at least for us). Three of us went for the special, mom went for the ribs. The ribs were fall-off-the-bone tender. Our tails, though small, were tasty. The steaks, well things break down here a bit. They were very thin, and a bit on the tough side, but not so bad that we did not finish them. Veggies were no big deal but the potato was OK.   If I had more time, I probably would have come back to try the $8.99 prime rib.  One thing to note, when it says 9PM, it means 9PM. The computerized ordering system won't give you the special price until 9, and the hostess won't seat you until you are ready to order. Couple that with people are going to queue for the special(s), and you may want to get there a little early.  Bottom line: I'm glad we had this \"special\" experience.   PS. If you are a bit early, you can order drinks and appetizers and then place your special entrees order after 9.",

My friends and I were hungry and tipsy and couldnt wait to try this place. Finally, after 30 minutes, we got seated and all ordered medium cooked steak with lobster. While the dish was set on our table, our mouths drooled and couldn't wait until we take the first bite. The first bite of the steak tasted like rubber and had no taste (even though we ordered medium and it was red still). The lobster had no taste. We all know that when we're drunk, everything tastes better, but this place definitely didnt taste good at all. It actually woke me up from being tipsy because i was shocked at how it turned out and how much i had to actually chew to swallow the meat.   I guess it's True, you get what you pay for.  This place was a definite no and i dont recommend this place.",

The quality is more than adequate for the price with a tasty lobster tail and a decent \"buffet quality\" steak, which are made to order with a nice taste and texture. It is important to remember that it isn't \"steakhouse quality\" but enjoyable nevertheless.    It is also a nice, cozy but old atmosphere in the restaurant, which create a nostalgic vibe, appropriate in the Fremont area.   There is a pretty long line to get in so it is a recommendation to get there a bit early, around 8:30 PM or so. I got seated pretty quickly and they actually started to take the orders for the special even before the set hour, which is good. The waiting time was around 15 minutes but I could see that the line grew bigger later on.  I can recommend Tony Roma's and would also add that it is a better option than the Paradise Buffet if going on a day when the latter doesn't run their Steak Night.",

Haven't had Tony's in abt 20 years literally.... So my buddy and I ordered the full rack of BEEF ribs...thinking they whrnt gonna be huge like Lucille's I was surprised cause upon arrival placed in front of me whr the huge brontosaurus ribs!!! They gave me 6 huge ribs so for the $30 pricetag it averaged out to $5 a rib!!!! I also ordered Mac n Cheese and baked potato on da side... The Mac n cheese tasted like Kraft/Velveeta out the box but I wasn't tripping because I like that stuff! I did have a problem with the big potato though because it was not cut open and my Sour cream and butter and chives we're not in it????? Hello??? So you mean to tell me you bring me a big potato and you don't cut it open and make it look presentable??? It was just a baked potato slapped on the plate??? HOW RUDE! So Lastly The ribs were as tough as leather but it tasted good if that makes sense?? So I'm thinking they should've left the ribs in the smoker just a little bit longer??!! Or boiled them longer??? With every bite I was gnawing on the rib like a pitbull to Fresh throne steak!!! Indeed this is not an all out negative review because I had so much with da family and the BAKERS so it is wht it is...We whr mainly joking and clowning about the food!!!!! Although I must say every one else who got the pork ribs said it was pretty tender!!! In short-Tony Roma's-PLEASE GET IT TOGETHER!",

The wait here was 35 minutes long. We had to take a number and wait for our name and number to be called.  We sat around the casino floor area waiting to be seated.  We had one server for drinks and table necessities and one server for food. The drink server kept my glass filled and my napkins fresh. He moved fast, but was kind and courteous. My food server was clearly over worked. He had so many tables he barely had time to allow me to finish my order. I had a lackluster burger with limp fries. My companion had a burger slightly undercooked. When we mentioned this to the food server he didn't blink nor bat an eye.  We are less than 1/4 of what was presented on the plates. This was a valuable lesson for me, my instinct said no after hearing the wait time, I should have followed that. The service was ok, not great but ok. The food was just not tasty, aesthetically unappealing and mediocre.  I won't return. I can find better ways to lose $10.  I wish Yelp offered half point ratings. 1.5 based on our drink server.",

However, when your waitress only comes by 3 times the entire time you're sitting there for almost 1 hour waiting for your food to come to the table, you have issues. The kind and blonde bus woman was more attentive than our waitress. She definitely deserves a promotion or a raise because she's doing the job of a waitress. This restaurant needs some improvements, such as retraining their staff to be more courteous and more attentive to their customers needs instead of just leaving them alone to wait hungry. We didn't get the bread we were promised and waiting over an hour to get your food is ridiculous, especially when it's just mediocre.",

We were seated right away...but also fairly close to the front (therefore the heavy smoke from in the casino followed us in and hung out while we tried to dine). I did not see any of the specials that were listed on the outside sign. Didn't bother asking about them since I was dining with some people I didn't know super well. I ordered the sirloin steak; garlic mashed; and corn on the cob. The best part was the mashed potatoes (once I added a little salt & pepper) and used the sour cream with each bite. The steak was not very tender or tasty. The corn was extremely bland (had to add butter and salt to that as well). Once we were done and I handed the waiter my card to pay, he literally disappeared for about 15 minutes. I was about ready to get the manager. It was ridiculous how long I had to wait to get my card back and sign to get away from the mediocre food and nasty smoke. I will NEVER come back to this place if I ever do come back to Vegas. Nobody in my party was impressed which was a huge disappointment for me since I paid for everyone.",

We were seated right away which was nice, the place was filled with big groups (more families, etc).  I got their 'famous' Baby Back Ribs with a Baked Potato on the side. Yes, I might be tiny but I can eat A-lot:) They were good but nothing extraordinary and the potato was kind of cold.

Came here on a Sunday night.  It will get crowded so try to arrive a little early cause they will not start seating the customer(s) until 9pm.  My friends and I got lucky cause we were like fourth in line and got seated right away. Even tho it was busy the services was great, friendly, and was attentive making sure our meal was okay. Even the manager walked around making sure everyone was enjoying their meals & asking how we are doing. Don't expect a big huge portion of steak & lobster but it was a good size. The steak was a little bigger then my palm of my hand and the lobster was a good size not to small or big. My friend order the steak medium & it was cook just right. He was able to enjoy his steak and lobster, not to chewy or hard just right.  The baked potato was a good portion and had all the toppings. I order the maui maui with mango sauce. The fish was not dry or over cooked it was perfect and the mango sauce was flavorful.  We didn't wait long either came out maybe about 10-15 mins after we place our orders. I gave it a three cause it's a typical Tony Roma's...would definitely come back for the steak & lobster special.",

The Vegas Brand is a Loser Lounge, which acts as a restaurant for a good meal, drinks are great, but food needs a little imagination to go with it. Yea, a Lobster all the way from Maine and a low end section of the cow to make the most cheapest meal with the little bit of winnings you got left. I know after beating those Texans at the table they ain't gonna give me their best piece of meat? I find the staff friendly but slow, there are a lot of Roma fans from all over the country and the advertised $11.99 is a way of gettin em in there! This is one of the few places in Vegas that does not serve Ice cube drinks (75% ice Cube-5% liquor). Downtown is loosing it's seediness and getting like 42nd street New York? So if you are one of the few to make it in for the $11.99 deal tack it up as a dinning experience :-)",

We only moved to Vegas last month, and this was the first time we tried Tony Roma's in Vegas and never will again.  The hostess was sloppy, the busboy took my date's request for water and left the table without even acknowledging me.  The waitress was either very busy or lazy because AFTER she brought our salads, I HAD to request bread -- then on her next trip to the table, we repeated our request, and she finally brought it after our entrees.  The salad was very disappointing, and the ribs were worse.  Not only that but the hotel was doing some cleaning work (at 5pm) and it was a terribly long walk to the restrooms because the direct path was blocked off (the restaurant staff didn't think this was inconvenient for customers).",

Considering we were sitting 6 feet from the host stand, we knew he did not call our number.  We also heard him explain to another employee (manager?) that he already sat our number.  Regardless, he ended up seating us 5 minutes later, no apology for messing up. After sitting for over 10 minutes without anyone coming over for our drink order, we left.

Now let me ask you a question: when have you ever been to a store and been all that excited if you saw a big cut of steak for $3? Or a lobster? If you're like me, the first thing that runs through your mind is: \"How sickly did this cow/crustacean have to be for them to offer to sell it to me at this price??\" Now, either Tony secured some awesome deal in the beef/seafood futures market ten years ago so as to lock in a below market price to be able to offer such a great deal... or it's just not great quality stuff. Unfortunately, I think it's the latter.   This all being said - as the 3 star rating suggests, this place is A-OK as long as you're not expecting the Palms.

    "text": "The hostess who seated me was all business & no time to smile or make you feel welcomed. My waitress was excellent & so was the male bartender. Very nice & personable. I had the special which was the steak & lobster. It was just ok. The lobster was 2 bites. The vegetables I think were from a can. The steak was good. The baked potato was cold. I was very hungry & yes I ate it. Will I order that again?  NO!  I don't think it was worth the price I paid for the meal even though it was a special they were running. It was not worth the half hour waiting in line to be seated. What a big disappointment for a restaurant that I liked. Notice the past tense. I have no respect that they were not ashamed serving me that plate of food. I would rather pay more for a decent hot meal. A salad & dinner roll would have been nice too since the portions they served were so small.",

    "text": "My wife and I celebrated our first wedding anniversary at the Tony Roma's in Tucson AZ.  We were a new couple, not expecting much, but we did hear about their ribs from friends.  So we went for the famous Baby Back Ribs.  I have no recollection of the sides, was it a baked potato? Fries? Coleslaw? But I have excellent recollection of the ribs.  They were excellent.  Each and every one of them.  We kept coming for more, until one day that location of Tony Roma's in Tucson shut its doors.  It was a sad day.  But since then, we visited Tony Roma's in various places, and we always appreciated the consistency.  Every single time we ordered the Baby Back Ribs, it tasted practically identical to the time before.  In my dictionary, quality and consistency are tightly related.  A couple of weeks ago, I took my son to see a Blue Oyster Cult concert at the Golden Nugget.  We landed in Las Vegas on Thursday, and as we were arriving at the Golden Nugget, my wife called and said that there's a Tony Roma's not too far from the Golden Nugget.  In fact, it was right across the street.  My son, the carnivore that he is, would never say no to a good steak.  In fact, we used to say that he would never eat anything that didn't have parents...  It's been many years since we had those ribs in Tucson.  My 16 years old son, the youngest of my children, never heard of it.  And there we were, seated at the Tony Roma's in Las Vegas.  For me there was no question: Baby Back Ribs.  He chose the Sirloin Steak.  Twenty minutes later, my plate had a pile of bones, and his plate was glistening in the dim light...  To my great surprise the ribs tasted the exact same they did more than twenty years ago, his steak was, according to him, one of the better ones.  It wasn't expensive, it was a very good meal for the price we paid.  We left the restaurant with a taste of more.  Indeed, a couple of days later, on our last night in Vegas, we came to check it out again.  We were not disappointed.  One last observation: the restaurant is practically always open just as many other establishments in Las Vegas are.  It is a huge restaurant, many dozens of tables, and it was full, with a waiting list.  It operates as a Swiss clock - waiters are efficient and polite, the food is served hot and the wait after you ordered is not very significant.  Empty plates with piles of bones are cleared quickly, and the service is excellent.  Tony Roma's of Las Vegas, if you're there and you like ribs, I would certainly try it out.  You just might come back for another rack real soon.  Right, and the Blue Oyster Cult concert was spectacular.

We had the worst experience last May, 2018, at the Tony Roma's in Las Vegas at the Fremont Hotel. Our food was served so slowly several tables that were seated after us were finished eating before we were served our meals. The food was cold. The waitress was rude, and Christine, the hostess/cashier, was condescending. Indeed, this was the bad restaurant experience trifecta.   We go on an annual family vacation to Las Vegas every year and I can say, without a doubt, that Tony Roma's is NOT on our list of restaurants to visit for 2019. We were disappointed. I had never been to a Tony Roma's before and was under the impression the restaurant was very good. Unfortunately, that was not the case, and I doubt I will ever go to another Tony Roma's.",

It was more like 30 min but still acceptable. We were seated just inside the door by the bar.   It was LOUD for sure, and some of the patrons were already lit and having some conversations that the whole restaurant could hear... not my favorite thing while trying to eat.  But what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas.. lolo The waitress came over, informed us of the specials,  hubby and I ordered the prime rib, baked potato and mixed veggie 8.99 special. I WAS truly surprised at how good it was.  A simple meal, not too pricey !  Now, criticism would be, no bread at table while we waited, the wait staff was sooooo busy so not much as far as table service, but we did get refills.  We were in and out,  with wait time,  1.5 hours.  We would recommend at least stopping by and having dinner here at least once per visit !!",

Baby Back ribs were overcooked and dry and the sauce (I didn't get a choice, just one option) was overly sweet and didn't have a kick.   At least they did bring the extra butter, REAL butter, I asked for for my baked potatoe. The coleslaw was ho-hum.   Service was adequate as the place was hopping busy. Not worth the price IMHO. I've had way better BBQ for less $$$.",

Thank you both for your kindness!   We were walking down Fremont looking for more food!  LOL!  I suggested ribs..and in we went.  The wait wasn't long since it was 10:30...people were still coming in since they close at midnight.  Three of us got ribs, and one tried the steak and lobster special.  Steve-O asked for lobster in his mash taters and they obliged.  I got a side of bacon mac n cheese.  Everything came out in a timely manner...and granted, my buddies were still drinking, so we kept on being obnoxious.  Again, shoutouts to Vanessa and Allen...I seriously hope these are the names of the two servers that took care of us....they were both very kind!",

My mother asked for a loaded potato and they literally brought her a simple baked potato. Kayla never said that it would be $2 extra for the cheese and sour cream. Then when I brought that to her attention she said she can bring everything separately and we can basically put it together ourselves and still get charged the extra $2. Now don't get me wrong I don't have any issue paying the extra $2 it was the way she went about things. Towards the end, we're waiting to get our check and Kayla once again was no where to be found we had to ask the lady that put our name on the list to sit us down. The food and the service were just unbelievable. I can definitely say I will never ever be back to this specific place for anything not even water. It was just a huge disappointment. I would definitely recommend for any one thinking of going here to choose somewhere else for your family.",

The waiter came to the table asked what we wanted to drink. One of the ladies ordered a drink before we could order our drinks he had left the table. He came back with just her drink. Smh. We ordered our food. We had the steak and lobster special 11.99. I added a half of rack of ribs for 9.00. The food was cold and not seasoned. The food was disgusting. Couldn't eat the steak no flavor at all. Check comes and its on one ticket. We ask to split the bill. The waiter brings us back 15 different receipts. Ive never seen anything like that in my life. He never asked if the bill would be on one ticket. So i had about 10 extra dollars in taxes alone because this incompent waiter. If u are in Vegas stay out of this restaurant. You really get what you pay for.",

The restaurant seats guests all at once for dinner, which I thought was a very strange procedure. Even the orders go to kitchen all at once by sections of the restaurant. It's a very confusing mess, so be prepared to wait up to 40-50 minutes before your food is served. Sometimes you just gotta bow down to the babyback rib gods, and rub some of that tangy barbecue sauce on your forehead. Just pray that the shrine of Roma's holy ribs doesn't shut down in the next season or two.",

    "text": "My girlfriend and I went in early September 2015 for (what else?) the $11.99 steak and lobster special.  You have to wait 30-40 minutes to be seated, but IMHO that's likely put in place by the Fremont St. casino that's no doubt subsidizing the cost of a dinner literally 1/2 the price of anything else on Tony Roma's menu: \"Oh look, Gladys. It's gonna be 40 minutes before they seat us. What to do? Hmmm, these slot machines look like they might be fun...\" At any rate, downtown Vegas at night has plenty to do and see while you're waiting.  We got back to the restaurant's lobby (located DEEP in the casino) near the appointed time, waited a few minutes, and were seated. The waiter was friendly enough, and the food was pretty good: yes, the veggies were obviously the prepackaged frozen kind you can buy at any grocery store and the unwrapped baked potato is served without even being cut open, but this is what you get for $11.99 for steak and lobster, and neither is a deal-killer. The steak itself was tasty (if smallish), and the lobster was tres yummy!  If you're looking for a late dinner for a great price (our total bill was less than $40, including drinks and tip, for a meal that would have cost $100 or more anywhere else in Vegas), this special is hard to beat. We're definitely going again next time we're in town.",

    "text": "After eating out at a Ruth's Chris Steak house and not thinking the food was quite worth the price the night before (over $100 per person for dinner), we decided to take advantage of the $8.99 prime rib special while hanging out on Fremont St.   Well, you get what you pay for sometimes.  When we were seated there were two police officers talking to an elderly gentleman because he did not have money to pay his bill.  I think it would have been better if he had been escorted outside to finish the conversation, but it went on for at least 20 minutes even after another patron offered to pay his bill.   Meanwhile, we had no service.  I understand completely servers not wanting to come over amid the situation, but then WHY seat us if you're not going to serve us????  After the man was led out, a waitress finally came over to take our order.  Over 30 minutes later, we still did not have food.  Another server came over and gave us refills on drinks which was very thoughtful.  However, when I asked him if he could check on our food, he got irritated and walked away while I was still communicating. I was trying to explain to him that two tables next to us arrived AFTER we ordered and had already been served.  I was not rude at all, but he did not want to hear it. To his credit, he is the only server who refilled our drinks on multiple occasions.  Our waitress did not fill our drinks once.  She came over to check, I think, once.  However, our drinks had just been replaced by the other server--the one who ignored my question about our food arriving. The food, ironically, arrived minutes later.  It was good.  We had never been to Tony Romas before, and the food was pretty good and amazing for the price.  When we left I did communicate my frustrations to the manager who was very nice.  By then I was frustrated.  Even though I was clearly annoyed at the poor service (and I was pissed that the server ignored me when I asked if he could check on our food), he was kind and patient.  I planned on one star, but bumped it up to two for the nice manager.   If you're broke and NEED to eat here, feel free to do so.  My time is worth more, so next time it will be a more expensive place just so my time is not wasted.",

I went ahead and snuck away from the table to tell the manager it was her birthday so that I could be embarrassed her and he said that they could bring out a Sunday and that at the end of the meal it would come out.Well we ordered our food or appetizer came out really quick we didn't even take a couple bites out of it and our main course was already there so we just went along with it then they went ahead and drop the check off and I had to go behind her head and tried to tell the waiter that it was her birthday and he proceeded to come up with a menu and say to something for your birthday. Needless to say my whole plan was totally ruined. That I went ahead and talk to a female manager and She stated that she spoke with the male manager and that he got things confused and that she was very very sorry. They proceeded and even charged me the birthday cake and all they could do was say I'm sorry. The lobster tails were cold my ribeye was like fat. This had to be one of the most horrible experiences I have ever had at a restaurant in my whole entire life. Needless to say I will never come back again. I'm so pissed that you ruined my birthday surprise to my friend my best friend of over 30 yearsI was so looking forward to embarrassing her and you ruined it. And the food sucked was horrible. I was waitress When Lonestar steakhouse was out here and the food that we served Compared to what I ate there was horrible. I was so looking forward to coming to eat there I had heard so many good compliments about that place I am so disappointed and it is a shame that management can't relay messages and communicate you guys need to get it together. Shame on you for ruining something that was soooo special to me!!!",

I reaaalllly wish I had looked up the Yelp rating before we ended up here, but we were hungry and my phone wasn't working, and it is a chain, so I thought, how bad can it be? Mistake #1  Mistake #2? Ordering the lobster...I know, I know, ridiculous to think I would get decent lobster here, but my husband knows I love it and again, I thought, how bad can it be? BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD First of all it was 22.99 and I swear the two lobster tails were each the size of my husbands finger. If they hadn't come attached to shells, I would have thought they were large shrimp. They looked terrible, but I was so hungry, so I gave it a shot. First one, WAY WAY overcooked, took two bites to finish the whole tail. Second one? Took one bite and thought \"I am going to be throwing up tonight\" It was horrific, and made my stomach lurch immediately, so no finishing that one.   While the lobster was definitely the defining bad moment of dinner, I will also add that I asked for garlic mashed potatoes instead of baked potato, got baked potato, had to ask for the mashed and once they came my stomach was so rocky from the lobster, I couldn't eat much, but they were pretty salty and not that great. Also asked for rolls, three times, finally got them and frankly that was about all I ate just to have something on my stomach.   Sooo, the best thing I can say is, I did not end up sick that night, which I feel is some kind of a miracle given what that lobster tasted like. I guess I will add that my husband's burger was fine, so there is that I suppose, but I refuse to give more than one star to this place. The staff was nice, but incredibly slow and like I mentioned above, screwed up my order and really didn't want to bring those rolls. Dinner was $50 and I am still insanely irritated that we even paid it. I should have talked to a manager, but we just wanted to get the heck out of there and try to salvage the rest of our night.   Do yourself a favor and DO NOT eat here. You could pick up a candy bar from the store down the street and have a better dinner.",

The place seemed under staffed and our waiter was pretty much non-existent after our order arrived, which, by the way, sucked. The ribs were warm, not hot, and basically flavorless really. I've  had better chicken strips from Schwann's and the cole slaw was horrid. The ONLY thing good from our experience were the alcoholic drinks. We could have had a better time at any fast food place...it was that bad. Such a disappointing experience for such a big name place.

My .99 cent 16 oz. beer in hand and very curious. The casino smells like an ash tray and by this time in Vegas the smell of smoke indoors went from novelty to old. But a pushed past it and confirmed the price on the Prime Rib. Then I walked out, only to rethink my decision because I figured I had enough time of the meter polish this order off and keep on moving. I sat down and placed my order. Then I looked around waiting and saw the servers were bringing out plate after plate of Prime Rib. It's at this price between 4pm-6pm and clearly popular. When my order came it looked good. Prime Rib, a small baked potato and mixed vegetable And you know what? For the price this was pretty good. Yeah it's $8.99 but it's just what you'd expect for the price. If you really like prime rib, this is just what you'd expect to have for the price. That's fair and I was happy because i knew this and knew too that if I wanted more, I could and should pay for more. But for what it is, it's just right. I'm a fan !",

The two lobster tails LOOKED like lobster tails, but tasted like soggy, mushy paper. The mixed vegetables tasted like they came out of a bulk frozen bag of vegetables (fine for a hasty dinner at home, but unacceptable for a restaurant). The small baked potato at least had some flavor, AFTER adding butter, sour cream,  and seasonings. My stomach is still feeling woozy 16 hours after eating at this restaurant. My advice, stay away from seafood in the desert and save it for dining on the coast.",

    "text": "This Tony Roma's is located inside a Vegas casino and is nothing like any of the other Tony Roma's restaurants I have been to.  All of the other Tony Roma's exude a certain level of classiness and have a few regular items on the menu that I always look forward to ordering.  I feel that all Tony Roma's chains should live up to their usual standards, but this one falls far below. Where do I start?  Firstly, the reason I decided to eat here in the first place was because of all the signs outside luring you in with a picture of juicy prime rib, accompanied by a big baked potato and veggies that says \"Only $8.99!\"  After you walk through the rowdy smoke-filled casino to get to the restaurant, you are greeted by nobody. Rather, you have to walk up to an angry lady standing at a podium and let her know that you would like to be seated.   She asks your name without looking at you, and writes it down as she rudely says \"30 to 40 minute wait. No prime rib tonight.\"  Are they kidding me? How is a place like this so packed? They don't offer the meal they so widely advertise and the service is already this crappy before even getting seated!  I was very tempted to leave and eat elsewhere, but me and bae were hungry and didn't feel like going on the hunt for another restaurant.     We stood up until a seat cleared so we could sit down and wait. As we waited, we had to hear the lady at the podium scream names out as tables opened up. Why can't they invest in a microphone and speaker?  Once we were seated, I decided to put the experience thus far behind me and order some of that yummy Tony Roma's food.  I really look forward to the warm bread and savory garlic butter served at every Tony Roma's before your food comes.   What a surprise, they do not carry the garlic butter. They don't even serve bread unless you request it. I did, but it never came.  At least the entree was good. We shared the Roma Rack of ribs, baked potato soup, and a fudge cookie ice cream dessert.   During dinner, we had the privilege of witnessing a woman choke on her meat and a man perform the Heimlich Maneuver on her about 10 feet from our table. Thank God it worked and she was okay.  My boyfriend drank a soda with his meal and I had a glass of water with lemon. It tasted like the most disgusting grade of tap water I ever drank. I hope they also invest in a Britta filter or something.  Very classy joint, huh? This place almost has no right going under the name Tony Roma's unless they adjust their standards accordingly.   I will never make the mistake of coming to this particular Tony Roma's ever again.",

Can't work miracles with a cheap product.  Steaks should be restaurant quality \"choice\" grade.  Believe it or not it takes about a full year for a cook to master grilling steaks correctly. -steak and lobster special.  DISCONTINUE!  Epic Failure!  If you want to continue hearing complaints then keep it on the menu.  Doesn't even matter if you charge 5.99, it's still not good.  I've owned two restaurants.  You'll never please everyone, but these issues can be fixed.  Just gotta fix it!  Great hamburgers!  If you want repeat customers things have to change.

    "text": "Tony Roma's what can be said, not much in comparison. I must admit for first impressions I was really disappointed, I had been waiting for this restaurant for so long and it really did not meet my expectations. Let's start with the one good quality this restaurant has. Service, our server was extraordinary in all aspects, not to mention nice and very detail oriented. Now that's out of the way. This restaurant has so much wrong with it, I'm utterly surprised it was as crowded as it was. The atmosphere, decorations and furniture are extremely outdated, it feels more like a cafeteria, rather than a four star restaurant. The food was no better, portion sizes are small, to feeling nonexistent. I know the rule; quality over size but quality fell in the nonexistent category as well. From the 14oz ribeye with coleslaw and baked potato, to the bacon cheeseburger an American classic that they couldn't even prepare right. The steak was a more done then what was ordered. It's a big difference when you order medium rare but receive well done. From bacon not being fully cooked to fries completely overshadowing the plate. Presentation was horrific, quality was horrific, as well as serving size. You pay for four star quality at this restaurant but receive one star in return. The (1hr 45 minute) wait time was nowhere near worth the wait. Good things do not come to those who wait. My rating a disappointing 1.5 out of 5. My advice avoid Tony Roma's. So many places in Vegas offer everything you're looking for sadly this restaurant is not one of them.  This review was written by my husband Brandon Sinard, writer of AnalyzeSports365",

    "text": "SATURDAY NIGHT SPECIAL  Before we packed our Vegas bags, I commented to my husband that while there, I wanted to find a cheap lobster dinner. Some wives probably ask to be taken out to a nice lobster dinner. I wanted a nice dinner too, don't get me wrong, but I knew a cheap lobster dinner could be found and I wanted us to find it.  We were there less than 48 hours when dinner found us! We had been walking around Downtown Vegas and seen signs on the Fremont Hotel for an $11.99 steak and lobster dinner. I pointed it out with excitement. Unfortunately, we weren't hungry! But....after a couple more hours strolling and dancing, our appetites caught up and it happened to be between the hours the special was being served!  We had a 30 minute wait and we were not alone. The waiting area was packed! We were finally sat and our server (George) dropped off menus on his way to take another order. He returned not long after with a smile, even though I'd watched him scurry from table to table in the interim. His section was slammed and one booth was pretty impatient about not having received their bill yet. We decided we weren't in a hurry and placed identical orders (lobster and extra rare steak). I added a side dish of garlic green beans to mine.  Bread service came. A plate of Promise (buttery spread) packets came with it. A serious mound of fake butter! We ate our share until the dinners arrived.  I don't anything nice to say about the flat piece of steak I received, except that it was very rare and it wasn't bad dipped in butter, but mine was mostly fat. Husband ate all of his and said it was about what he expected. We both agreed the lobster was better than expected. They were tiny tails but they were tender and well-seasoned and the drawn butter coated the bites nicely. My green beans were actually terrible. Rubbery and not much garlic to be found. For the meal we received, the excellent service, and the cost, overall I would say we found a great value here!  ($28.40 total)  A good server can really set the tone for the evening. George's contagious smile kept us smiling all night too.",

They tasted like the ones I get from costco. Not what you'd expect. I had the sirloin steak cooked medium. They gave me a burned steak on the outside and rare on the inside. Not good at all. My wife got the soup of the day. It tasted like it was out of a can. The quality of the food is very bad. Do not eat here. Go find a different place to eat, unless you like to overpay for frozen wings and canned soup. Overall very dissapointed.",

    "text": "We went there for the 11.99 steak and lobster special.  There was quite a line. and we hoped that the popularity of the place was indicative of good food.    We were wrong.  The \"steak\" portion consisted of a small, unidentifiable cut off beef with ac strange flavor.    The lobster tail looked dry and had an awful appearance and texture.  It didn't tastequite  as bad as it looked though, but I would still characterize it as mediocre at best.  The mixed vegetables appeared to be out of a can.  Even though the price is low, the special is totally not worth it.  It is nothing but small portions of bad food, and you have to wait a long time in line just to eat that garbage.  The only positive about the entire meal was that the cocktails from the bar were pretty good.  Avoid the steak and lobster special at all costs.",

No sorry and the were quite abrupt and rude. I cannot therefore recommend this restaurant especially for gluten free diners.",

    "text": "Well, I was at this Tony Roma's in March and gave a bad review. Management asked for me to give them another try. Well tonight, Aug 5, I tried again at 9:45, this time I have their steak and lobster special. Service was poor, a little better than last time, but I ordered my steak rare. It came out super well done, and the waiter never came back to ask how it was. The lobster was tiny but tasty.  I didn't expect much for $11.95, but even so I was greatly disappointed. So now Two strikes and you are out in my ball game. Sorry, Tony but there are literally a hundred better restaurants in Vegas and nearly all the other places downtown off the arcade are better. So now they go to one star simply because their food didn't make me sick",

    "text": "One of the worst dining experiences ever. Went in tonight for a late dinner with my boyfriend. We were seated and immediately noticed there was garbage all over the floor.  He ordered a burger and I ordered the steak and lobster tail special. We explained to the server that my boyfriend has a seafood allergy so it is very important that his food did not touch mine or any other seafood.  Shortly after, another server drops off a water and soda at our table we didn't order. A minute later she comes back and says it was for the table next to us and then proceeds to take them from our table and sets it on theirs. The couple next to us received their food and we overhear the woman here send back her soup because it is cold.  Our food arrived and my boyfriend immediately noticed his plate was dirty with dried crusted on food from who knows what. I took a bite of the lobster tail and then immediately spit it out and wiped my tongue. The texture was complete mush. I can only describe it as being like mashed potatoes. We asked to speak to the manager and told her about our two issues with the food and said that we would be leaving. She replied \"okay\" and that was it.  Dirty plates are unacceptable on any occasion but especially concerning after letting the server know about the food allergy. I'm also five months pregnant and freaking out about the thought that I may have put spoiled shellfish in my mouth. It has completely ruined my night and just praying that I don't get sick. Seriously, are they trying to kill somebody?!  We will be contacting the health department first thing tomorrow morning.",

    "text": "You get what you pay for, which isn't much to be honest.  We expected a lot more restaurant choices for Fremont Street but there really isn't.  What restaurants there are are INSIDE the casinos so it's a pain just to find one.  We settled on Tony Roma's because it wasn't too expensive and we really just wanted to eat.  The host told us 30 minutes even though half the restaurant was empty.  They page the numbers overhead so you can go wander in the casino and not worry about missing being called.  We didn't have to wait 30 minutes, so I guess they were just playing it safe.  One server brought us water and silverware, but then our actual waiter didn't show up for about 5 minutes.  Asked for recommendations for drink selections, he wasn't very helpful.  When you're at what you think is a nice sit down restaurant and they give you mayonnaise in a packet you should turn around and leave.  Food came out quickly but again, you get what you pay for.  I've had better food at TGIFriday's or Olive Garden.  I ordered the \"Cheesy Burger\" which had 3 or 4 different types of cheese and it was fine, nothing spectacular.  In fact there was almost too much cheese, and for a girl from Wisconsin it takes a lot for me to complain about too much cheese.  I could barely taste the burger.  Also I asked for no tomatoes and got tomatoes.  Fries were standard, nothing special.  My husband ordered some type of chicken sandwich with Jack Daniel's sauce.    When we were done we had to wait almost 15 minutes for our check.  Honestly, you can do better than Tony Roma's.  If you're okay settling for moderate food and a moderate price then go here.  Otherwise go anywhere else.",

The garlic green beans tasted like propane. The bacon Mac and cheese tasted like the stuff from the box, only made with three cheese packets. Shall we talk about the sirloin you see advertised everywhere? MIDWESTERNERS RUN THE OTHER WAY. It looked delicious, then I tried to stick my fork in it to cut it. Yeah, didn't happen. The fork couldn't pierce the surface of the steak. And chewing it? Forget it.  It also smelled rather peculiar, kind of how my snake's cage smells after she sheds and pisses everywhere. Save the baked potato, my entire meal was given to a homeless person. At least someone enjoyed it.",

If you're going for the $12 Steak/Lobster, don't go expecting a fancy huge steak and a huge lobster tail. Also don't expect that you're going to be the only person with an inside desire for this. Hello, this is Vegas!  Regardless of if you're here for the special or the regular menu, you're given a paper number. For those complaining about such, remember that this is Vegas. Lots of drunk people, young 21s etc who've probably walked off with the digital pagers etc. thinking it'd make a great souvenir.  It was about a 20 minute wait time for the regular crowd. Dunno about the special crowd for the steak/lobster, as we came about an hour before they did. And they don't give out numbers for that special until around 15-20 minutes before they open for such.  The wait wasn't too bad but as others have said, it gets so busy in this place that wait time on food and/or drinks can be horrendous at times.  Not the worst experience but definitely not great either.",

Horrible customer service from the hostess as well as the manger who obviously could care less if his customers are happy....what a joke let's at least hope that the food is good cause the service is shit and it's unfortunate for the server who is set up in a horrible situation due to his the poor management and hotness how is the server going to make a good tip if the hostess and manager set them up for failure",

Many people down on Fremont Street want to take the opportunity to go and eat at this infamous steakhouse. We waited about 30 minutes to get our table and we had a great waiter!  We started off with cocktails. I decided to get the steak and lobster special and my friend decided to get a hamburger. I also decided to get a wedge salad to start. It's hard for me to pass up a wedge salad it's one of my favorites! We were brought a bread basket with two different types of bread and butter. Considering how busy the restaurant was our food came out in a decent amount of time. My salad was brought first and then our meals followed. I ordered my steak medium rare which it came out prepared perfectly. And the lobster tail was perfection!  I highly recommend checking out this restaurant if you're on Fremont Street. You can't beat the price for a steak and lobster dinner!",

The wait time was less than the 15 to 20 minutes quoted to us and I love the fact that they ask for your cellphone number to text you once your table is ready for seating.   The food was decent, of course you can't expect much when you are hitting up the $11.99 special. The steak was cooked exactly to order and it was a pretty decent sized steak. The meal comes with baked potato and mix vegetables along with the small lobster tail. Everything was good, no complaints. I also ordered a pina colada which was also perfectly made.   We left fully satisfied and we were only in the restaurant maybe 50 minutes because the food came out rather quickly.  First time here and I'll visit again.",

Walked over to the restaurant and it was packed there was a line waiting, people were everywhere waiting.  Checked in with the host who was really nice, said the wait is about 20 minutes,  okay no problem well wait.  He told us what's your number we'll text you when your table is ready.  Perfect.  Have him my number and went right outside to play on some machines hehe I love to gamble I will gamble all day and all night. 20 minutes went by and I get a text please come to the front desk your table is ready.  Okay.  We were seated by people.  It just seemed a little squishy when I sat down.  I could hear the Childress conversation right by me.   Got the menus from a very nice gentleman who was our server. Of course I knew they had a naked potato soup because I studied the menu on line lol. I got some of that. It came out quickly and it was okay but just to much came in the bowl. I got a t bone steak and a side order of beans. I didn't know that it was like baked beans so I asked for another kind which was green.  Okay no problem.  The steak was cooked to medium well and it was perfect.  A little too much for me.  But just the right amount of seasoning and it was juicy.  Our server was really nice and understanding and attentive.  He checked in on us just the right amount of times..  Skipped dessert as we were stuffed.  Will come back the next fune we'r are in Las Vegas and walking around Fremont.   Oh they only open for dinner. So come in the late afternoon.",

It was excellent!   As an added bonus, this location on Fremont Street gave us huge entertainment for the rest of the evening.  If you haven't seen Fremont Street, you need to go!",

Few highlights:   Its located inside the Fremont hotel and Casino downtown Vegas.  I walked up to the hostess and shared i had a party of two and she said if its for the special menu, we are not seating ppl yet. So I was confused because we just wanted to sit and eat and didn't know anything about the special. I told her nah we are here just to eat, LOL. Well I found the special menu was steak and lobster for $11.99.   Anyway, honey wanted ribs and thats the main reason why we went.  I order the spinach stack chicken breast, mashed potatoes and green beans ($14). No seasoning, i removed the spinach from the top of the breast and covered it in bbq sauce lol. The sides were great and I just drank water. Next time ill order bbq chicken. Here are a few pics, on to the next lol",

I'm not sure if she was just too busy that day or what... but it was lackluster for sure.   The cleanliness was questionable. It screamed... \"Please revitalize me.\" It looked like a diner but decent pricing despite its location. The place just smelled... old. Everything was outdated and I'm not sure how old the furniture was but wow, what a dusty place lmao. I was hoping for the best as I stared at the 2 star average and huddled against the wall trying to maneuver out of people's way. The wait area is nowhere near large enough to accommodate the crowd waiting for a mediocre meal.   Everyone at the table split some form of ribs platter since it seemed to be famous. We all went with original, and it was okay. The ribs were good,  saucy, and filling. I was just too distracted by my surrounding to probably fully enjoy the meal. Everyone at the table was content with flavor, temperature, and their sides. Can't complain too much. It was an alright experience that I never want to do again, tbh. I won't be back, but I hope you guys that are forced to eat here can enjoy it with better service than I received.",

    "text": "I went into this restaurant because their \"$11.99 steak and lobster\" dinner deal caught my attention. I wasn't expecting much, seeing that it was so cheap, but I didn't expect it to be so bad. Also, when we went to the restaurant at 9:30 pm, they told us that we had to wait until 10 to be seated.... I don't understand how the restaurant can be so packed when its ratings are so low :\\  I ordered my sirloin steak medium rare, and it came out really hard and chewy - closer to a medium or medium well done. The steak was also really small and thin in size (approx 0.5 in thickness) and lacking in juiciness. The lobster, on the other hand tasted alright. I don't actually loooove lobster in the first place so ye. This meal came with a baked potato, peas/corn/carrot veggie mix, and sour cream + melted butter.   My dad ordered an Asian chicken salad with crispy chicken (instead of grilled chicken). The salad tasted alright, but the crispy chicken tasted incredibly crispy (and not necessarily in the best way). I was expecting something more like karaage or fried chicken bits, but it was just straight up crunch. I enjoyed the wonton croutons and the dressing though :) The salad was certainly the most refreshing thing I've eaten during my time at Las Vegas.",

Its really unfortunate, I'd really have liked to try the food but unfortunately their system is just not up to scratch.

She was a bright spot in this busy loud restaurant.  The location is cramped full of tables to maximize profit I'm sure due to the high lease of space in casino.  We got our food quickly, but my lobster was over cooked and my steak the should have been medium rare was medium well.  The taste was bland fro the steak and it seemed the grill needed to be cleaned as it tasted like burnt char.  All in all just okay the bill was $32.94  paid $40 because our server deserved the tip.  Will not be back here again.  If you go for the special expect to wait an hour.",

The ribs came out cooked to order and of decent size and quality, accompanied by a baked potato and vegetable (in tonight's case, corn). These dinner specials also come out super-fast, and this is a really good option if you want a decent meal in a fast-food time frame.  The staff was very accommodating. We wanted to be sure we were seated before 6:30 when the specials ended, and not all of our party had arrived at the same time. They allowed those of us who were there to be seated to order while we waited for the rest of the group to arrive, and we continued to order drinks (good selection of basic beers) and dinners. In addition to the specials, people in our party who ordered other steaks or burgers were equally satisfied. One of our party members also had the misfortune of having some food spilled on him as a plate was being cleared. We were immediately given what felt like a lifetime supply of moist towelettes, and he was comped for dinner, so we were satisfied with how the incident was handled.  The desserts are surprisingly good. If you saved room, get the sampler so you can have 3. The only one I would not recommend is the cheesecake, which just didn't have the right creaminess and texture. All the others are delicious.",

The busser took my ice tea to refill it and never brought it back lol either way the food is so cheap and was the perfect meal to enjoy on Fremont",

My summer friends, Disney and Tony Roma's \"a place for ribs\". We would always get ribs, some great appetizers and the onion loaf... a couple of years ago, I was in Orlando and on International drive I ate at a Tony Roma's, fantastic!  Well, this visit to Tony Roma's in the strip was anything but... When I saw the sign, immediately I said, Tony Roma's \"a place for ribs\", I LOVE THAT PKACE!!! Man what a disappointment!  When we arrived, there were cheap dollar store wicker baskets in the table with little individual promise margarines. YUK! Not to mention, no bread was even brought to the table, so what was the promise even for? We were starving, so we ordered apps and the onion loaf. GROSS! The apps were cold, lifeless and clearly crappy frozen product that I could have e gotten in Publix. The onion loaf, crispy outside but a mushy and pasty inside... dinner, good ribs, but the sides, cold and terrible! Garlic mashed potatoes had no taste! The consistency was terrible... well, I know one thing. Next time I'm in Vegas. No Tony Roma's for me!  I'm in the industry, I know that Tony Roma's is undergoing some change with the new TR Grill. Unfortunately, that change never made it out to Vegas. They're still stuck in 1978!!!",

We walk in at 10:30 pm and the host asks how many people re in our party. We say 5 and his response was \"if nothing opens up in 30 minutes we can't serve you.\" Umm wtf kind of crap is that? So many things wrong with that answer.  1. You close at 11, not 1030!!! 2. Why even ask how many people if you're not even going to serve us? 3. We saw about 4 open tables. Why not sit us there? 4. Way to be accommodating to paying customers. I'm sure it's awesome for business.  Unfortunately, we were seated. Our server was pleasant enough. I didn't eat anything since I had eaten earlier, but my friends said the food tasted old. I know for sure we won't be back.  Go somewhere else for better service and food!",

Polish up that resume sweetheart, Cuz working for tips is surely not gonna pay YOUR rent.  Ribs were served barely Luke warm, tender but flavorless. Microwaved fake \"baked\" potatoes that were undercooked. Margarine instead of butter in tiny plastic containers that were impossible to scoop out. Rude waitress said they did not have butter knives to scoop out the crappy margarine. Finally used the other end of fork to get the fake butter out. But what was the point to go through all that effort to put it on a hard potato that you could not eat. I could have put it on the stale rolls, but why bother, as we were not gonna eat those stale rolls anyway.  We did not know whether to laugh or cry. We took our uneaten meal in to go containers and gave it to a homeless guy. I felt bad passing on that meal to the poor unsuspecting soul.  Avoid this place like the plague.",

It looked like we had an hour wait because of all the other people that were ahead of us.  Turns out, we only waited 25 minutes.  I was surprised at the amount of time we waited.  We ordered our food and it was only a 20 minute wait!  Well, there's a reason why the wait to be seated went by quickly and why we had our food ready quickly - it all tasted like S**T!! Tony Roma's probably (by the taste of things) had everything cooked and prepared by the time the dinner rush was to come in.  They probably just cooked a lot of ribs and other popular dishes well ahead of time and when customers ordered those dishes, they probably just heated it up.  We ordered ribs and french fries!  Our fries was cold - not room temperature...cold!  Our ribs were dried out with barely no BBQ sauce on it - I had to add the BBQ sauce that they had available on our table.  Save yourself some $$ and don't waste it here.  It was definitely not paying $20.99 for a full rack of ribs - this was the worst food I ever had at a restaurant.  I forgot to mention that our waitress was nice but the other workers like the bus person was rude.  He even stopped to cough at our table in front of our food without even covering his mouth or apologize!",

    "text": "Worst food, worst service. I created this Yelp account just because of this bad experience. We ordered the $11.99 steak and lobster specials. We ordered the steaks medium-rare. When the steak and lobster arrived, both steaks had large completely uncooked portions. This food passed through two points where it should have been noticed: the cooks and the server. Both neglected to notice. Then, when we cut into our steaks, we saw that they were completely raw--through and through. I should also say that the steaks were far inferior in quality and smaller than any I've ever had. They look more like beef intestines that are pressed together into an extremely thin slab. It was not even the color of steak; it was a drab gray color. It is even more amazing that the meat was not cooked, since it couldn't take more than a couple of minutes to cook these sorry excuses for steaks. Our lobster tails smelled foul, so we did not eat them. When we presented the problem to the manager, we were offered $4 off each meal. When I said that they should be refunding both meals and be happy if we don't call the health department, the manager asked \"Is that a threat?\" Additionally, when I went to the restroom, the manager came to our table and yelled about my not being at the table. Seriously? Is this how you treat customers? This is a ridiculous place with ridiculous service. Oh, and I almost forgot to mention their typical clientele type. I saw a guy drinking straight out of a steak sauce bottle here. In my opinion, this place needs to be shut down. I hope that no one gets seriously ill from this place's food.",

They told us the the wait for a seat was 45 mins, no problem, it was in a casino so we figured we could entertain ourselves at the bar.   About 50 mins later, we had a Margarita at their bar (if you want to call it that), it was $7.50 for a Margarita and it was HORRIBLE!  We spoke to the bartender about it and he just didn't care. 1 hr and 15 mins later we were seated, then were asked to move to another table because THEY had sat us in a table for 5 instead of two.  Our waiter totally ignored us, took forever to take our order, then, AT LEAST 45 mins later we finally got our $11.99 steak and lobster.  This was AFTER we saw at least 5 other parties of people get THEIR food and they had arrived WAY after we did.  He realized that a mistake had been made and instead of giving us our order, he kept giving them away to everyone else!!!!! I finally called the Manager over, she apologized and said our order would come right up. NOT, it still took at least 15 -20 mins to get it.  I am normally a really good customer and tip VERY WELL because I know how hard waiters and bartenders work, but this time we just couldn't tip.  They didn't offer to comp us anything, only said they would buy us dessert if we wanted it.  Dessert?  Really?  I practically ran out of the place!  DO NOT GO TO THIS TONY ROMA'S!!!

Lobster tails were strong and overcooked, in spite of having to wait for them \"they weren't ready\", I suspect the waitress just forgot. We ordered mahi mahi and got chicken, when the replacement fish finally arrived it was watery and not real warm. We received dinner rolls when we were almost finished eating, they were warm but nothing to write home about. Baked potato and baked beans were good, fries were standard. Coleslaw was good.         Ambiance was no big shakes, all in all about the class of Applebees but more expensive, if not for winning some money at the 4 Queens down the street we may have been more upset, fortunately we didn't wait in line like many people had to.            Staff were just short of rude. Another table found a foreign object in there food. The mahi mahi, lobster tails and coffee were not on the bill, so that was refreshing  (we didn't ask to have them removed) if we would have had to pay for those items I would have taken off another star.

Not once did we get asked if we wanted refills on drinks. We had to wave someone down to get this refill. We places our order and the waiter even repeated that back to us. We waited and got 1 appetizer. The couple next to us ordered the exact same entree and a few more items then we did and got all there food before us. Once again we waived someone down and asked about our main entree and we'll let's just say it was never ordered... honestly no surprise the place has low star ratings. Decent prices, decent food, but could use some staff development in drinks and ordering...",

    "text": "If it sounds too good too be True, it probably is.   It used to be that casinos could sell good food as a loss leader, to get people to play the games, but it is clear that the specials themselves are now a cash grab.   The $12.99 steak and lobster was terrible.   I've seen better looking steaks in the freezer at Dollar Tree, and I wish that was an exaggeration. It was thin, leathery, and flavorless.   The lobster tail is an ounce of lobster meat, attached to the shell on the outside, and tasted like it was flash frozen after pre-cooking, and reheated in a microwave. The saving grace was the melted butter, which allowed you to choke down the rubbery lobster meat.   The mixed vegetables were exactly what you find in any frozen peas, carrots, and corn bag on your grocer's freezer.  The potato was, well, a potato.   Not only will I never eat at this Tony Roma's, but I won't ever eat at another Tony Roma's either.    Any chain that would allow their name to be associated with an overpriced TV dinner, billed as a great value restaurant quality meal, obviously has no pride in their brand.",

I'm not a fan of sirloin, so I got the pulled pork sandwich. There were a lot of people but every table, except for ours, got their food quickly. We waited about 35 minutes and 2 of our 3 plates were cold. We sent them back with the manager (I had him feel my sandwich and he told the waitress, \"It's legit cold\") and they rushed out new meals for us. It was okay overall (their original barbecue sauce has a very weird/strange taste), but my mom was not happy with her meal. So they removed it from the bill for her. I would've also expected something for mine, but there was not. No big deal. If you're looking for something basic or just right there, I guess it's not so bad, but with so many other options on Fremont, I would suggest going elsewhere if you want to be satisfied.",

If you order a steak you can get a lobster tail for $10. I estimate that the lobster tail had been sitting under a heat lamp for about 10 hours. It was shriveled to the size of a prawn and tasted like cardboard, no, um, rubber, um, not quite, well, let's just say it was awful and no amount of melted better could save it.   The steak wasn't quite that bad, but it was bad. I ordered medium rare and it came out medium. It was tough and dry and yucky, yes, yucky. The baked potato was actually pretty good and I ate all of it.  I definitely won't be going back to this location.",

As stated at the beginning of the review, glad I wasn't paying for my meal because it was not good.  I ordered the \"recommended\" Tony Roma's Steakhouse Burger and asked for it medium well. It came out medium for sure. Very pink in the middle, definitely not cooked enough to my liking. However, I was so hungry I did not bother to return it to the waitress. I also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack. She seriously was running around like a chicken with her head cut off. I think she had too many tables.  My brother also had the Steakhouse burger. We both agreed it wasn't anything spectacular. It came with two big slices of bacon on it and it was a pretty good size. The fries were not hot, and neither was my burger. It seemed like they'd been sitting around before being brought out. My aunt got the spinach dip appetizer. I had a taste, it tasted like spinach dip... and it too was lukewarm. My uncle got the shrimp cocktail. The shrimps looked decent sized, but the presentation was a little weird in my opinion.   This place is seriously a tourist trap for sure. The dining room is also dark and off-putting. They have really, really cheap specials which i did not partake of, but I don't know, maybe they're worth it?   Final decision: Tony Roma's will not be on my list of places I want to go eat.",

Server forgot one of my sides. 5 minutes later it came out, but she just dropped it off and ran.

I really enjoyed this eatery when I was back home in Hawaii and also in Redondo Beach CA, which has since closed down.   The place was packed but we were seated in no time. Our server brought our drinks out quickly and I was actually impressed seeing how busy it was.   We ordered steak, pork ribs, and chicken. My plate came out and I specifically asked for dark meat chicken. The server was so nice that she went out of her way to get the dark meat after claiming it was Chefs choice for the chicken type. Ive been here too many times to know that she was incorrect. Nonetheless, it was rectified.  Our server was very polite, friendly and quick to attend to our needs. I like how she checked up on us and asked if we needed her service. The food came out fresh and tasty, at least mine did. My friends claimed their steaks were ok and so this review is really on my personal experience and food I ate.   Foodies, this place was decent and I left satisfied. Try it out, you might like it.",

We liked going to have our ribs at Tony Roma's and so we come here to experience what we miss.  The St. Louis ribs are just as we remembered, the sweet BBQ sauce, and always one of my favorite coleslaw.  Food wise this Tony Roma's is great.  My beef is the process of getting into the restaurant.  Because no lunch, everyone comes for dinner and it can be a long wait.  Then it is a quick dash to find the table with an equally quick waitstaff.  It is all about getting you in and out.  I am perhaps a bit critical here, but I like to savor the experience of having Tony Roma's ribs when I'm in town.",

She is not taking reservations and she's telling everyone that she's fully booked even though I just walked in and I saw eight open tables. I've worked in a restaurant before I know what she's trying to do.  I know she's trying to go home on time but it's definitely bad for business. She is very unapologetic and definitely needs retraining. Bad service from a manager lets me know the attitude around here.",

The service was friendly and efficient. Albeit the food was far from quick. But our drinks never even got halfway finished before we had refills. I had the sirloin topped with blue cheese. Most of their entree items come with your choice of two sides. I opted for the fries and bacon mac 'n' cheese. Everything tasted alright. But none of it was exactly good. It was like buffet quality food (and I don't mean the nice, upscale buffets). Overall, it an a-ok experience. But I definitely wouldn't specifically choose to eat here.",

So of course Tony Roma's located inside the Fremont hotel & casino is always one of those spots!  If you come during the hours of 4-6:30 you can get a generous portion of prime rib, baked potato & veggies for $8.99! The dinner special is even better in my opinion. Lobster tail, sirloin steak, baked potato & veggies for $11.99! The steak itself isn't the greatest quality but what do you expect for $12?! The lobster was amaaazing though - would definitely get the special just for the lobster alone :p  Regular menu prices are decent. They have a large variety of salads and sandwiches too if you're opting for a lighter dinner/lunch.  It's a loud place. Tons of drunk people and rowdy crowds often stumble through here - but it's Vegas! Lol if you want a nice ambiance and \"fine\" dining make your way to the gold nugget or an actual steakhouse!",

    "text": "I was dining with my family on late Monday evening , had a lovely server, named Maggie. The meal was excellent, the server was amazing, the overall experience was a good one for me and my family. My only complaint is, when we were leaving, I overheard the supervisor or manager and a server in a heated discussion (more on her part). The manager was a Hispanic lady and was yelling and being unprofessional. I'm not sure of her name.  The woman asked the server,  I believe his name was Shawn (we had him as a server before, nice guy), something, I couldnt hear exactly what was said, but,  Shawn responded calmly, \" I'm a little busy, can you help me out, please?\"  The manager screamed at him,\"  WELL I'M BUSY TOO!\"  When I say scream, she screamed at him so loudly,  I had to cover my kid's ears. I don't know how the server did it, but,  he didn't say anything and just walked away. Then, I see other employees laughing at the whole situation.  As soon as the manager stopped yelling at the server, she went up to another employee, I dont know her name,  I just know she was Asian with really long, pretty hair  and started hugging her, conversing and laughing with her.  My husband and I just looked at eachother and were like, \" wow!\" The disrespect and unprofessionalism that manager showed in front of a packed restaurant to her employee and the restraint the guy had to just walk away without saying a word was something else.  All I can say was I felt bad for the guy. I really hope noone else has to experience or see what me and my family witnessed and I felt bad for the employee that had to be embarrassed and disrespected by his higher up instead of her helping out or asking someone else to help.  Management should be there to assist and guide their team.",

    "text": "There are few restaurants that encompass the very style and class of America's favorite eateries all in one place.  Tony Roma's most certainly does that. I kept seeing advertisements for this fine establishment all across vegas and based on the pictures,  I would put it in the same class with Gordon Ramsay's restaurants but in a Golden Corral budget. When I walked in I was excited to find out that I didn't need a reservation to eat,  the manager was very friendly and escorted me to my Pizza Hut style booth.    I have to say that the restaurant was crowded which was a good sign for the quality of food I was about to indulge.  I wasn't sure if they were there for the free keno or the St. Louis ribs but none the less the place was definitely a Fremont st favorite.  Surely a diamond in the rough.    The waiter came to speak to us and he was dressed nicely in a red Denny's Style uniform which was a bit over the top I thought.  He took our drink order and I was excited to find out they only had Pepsi products, felt like I was in one of those 1980 red pizza huts.  Even the water pitcher and the plastic cups resembled the dish selection I remember from eating at Pizza Hut as a child.  Man did it bring back some good memories.  You just don't find places like that anymore, especially in Vegas.  The menu was just a laminated sheet but it was easy to read,  I bet they spent many hours designing it.  It had several steak options but I come in for the ribs,  by golly they claim to be world famous and I couldn't pass up this opportunity to try it out for myself.  I ordered the St. Louis ribs and a wedge salad,  but was not ready for what I was about to receive.  The waiter brought out my salad very promptly and to my surprise they put salsa on top my wedge salad.  Nothing goes better with blue cheese than some pace picante sauce dripping off those crunch iceberg leaves.  I was very busy stuffing my face and I did not get a chance to play keno with the other guests.  I wish I did because what is better than conversation at the dinner table but a friendly game of keno.  So many well aged individuals were just having a ball of a time,  anxiously awaiting the next number to be called.  Enough with the games,  now let's talk about those ribs.  When the waiter brought them out I finally got to see what all the hype was about.  The display was excellent,  nothing showcases a nice slab or ribs than a plastic plate like the ones you get at your hometown buffet restaurant.  The ribs looked so succulent,  like they've been cooking under a heat lamp for hours.  The meat fell right off the bones.  I was amazed how they were able to bake the ribs so long that the sauce was crusty and penetrated into the meat.  Man those ribs were dry,  St. Louis rib eaters would have been proud.  It also came garnished with some Cole slaw in one of those paper cups.  A nice touch which also had some somewhat soggy fries on the side.  I was amazed that I could get all of this for just $20.  It tasted like I was eating some jerky which was not the texture I was expecting but jerky is what I got.  What a bargain,  they really know what their guests want.  I was also told if I stayed until 9pm I could get a steak and lobster for an amazing price.  I'm not quite the night owl but I will have to come back and try it out.  I would like to meet with their executive chef and request some of his prized recipes.  This place is bringing in so many high class individuals to enjoy old Vegas and indulge in fine cuisine.  If you're looking for a place to meet some high class individuals seated 3ft from you because of the crowded layout, play some keno,  and eat some steak as tender as a leather boot,  this is the place for you.",

Adding that the half rack of ribs that was half the meal were 4 individual end cutoffs of the last little burnt rib tips  then after the meal came we finally got a bus boy to bring water. We called the manager over and her response was there was nothing she could do . And demanded we pay the 175.00 check because she was to busy to deal with this . I cant believe that they treat customers like this after such a bad experience.We did not get what we ordered and they could care less.I was appalled by the total lack of customer service by this restaurant I assure you this is the last time I will ever spend a dime at this chain ...",

Food was good, not great - had to add A LOT of salt & pepper & the first time I used A1 Steak Sauce in probably 5 years. I would definitely go back for the special, again food was good and definitely reasonable. (FYI: There are no substitutions allowed & the baked potato does not come with cheese or any toppings.)",

Of all the tables I witnessed, none of the patrons ordered ribs, everyone was ordering the steak and lobster special.

As she was eating it a ROACH crawled up to my daughters plate. We both screamed a man came over and killed it. The manager came and said \" sorry, we will tell the steward to spray...\"  Huh?

We had a brownie with ice cream, warm apple tart with ice cream and a chocolate chip cookie with ice cream all delicious.

The $11.99 steak and lobster special is awesome, although I must recommend spending an extra $8 to have a $20 steak and two lobster tails dinner. It's worth checking out if you have time and want a fun place on Fremont Street.",

I mean, I understand you serve drunk people all day and that is probably grating, but this is the job you chose, so do it with some courtesy or don't do it at all.  The one positive thing I will say is I had a BLAST at the bar waiting for our table. The staff there was friendly and entertaining and drinks were cheap and generously poured.",

    "text": "O.M.G.  This was the WORST dinner ever!  We got lured in by the photos and pricing of the steak and lobster 'special' but this is a truly a case of getting what you pay for!  We'd been to a Tony Roma's in CA for ribs that were excellent and thought it'd at least be halfway decent but nothing could be further from the truth.  The steak was pathetically small and overcooked.  The lobster looked and tasted like it had crawled through the desert to get to the plate.  My margarita was little more than flavored water.  The only redeeming item was the rack of ribs we ordered as a side to share.  Terrible dining experience all around - don't waste your money here when there are so many fabulous restaurants in Las Vegas!",

    "text": "Well I thought I would never be a review poster but I feel obligated to the rest of the United States to post about this restaurant.  Simply do not eat here. If you are looking for a cheap meal in Vegas, just go grab a burger or something of a more pub fare restaurant. Do not be fooled into thinking you will get decent or even so so steak meal for a great price here.  Dirty tables, uncaring servers, wait times between water/drinks, etc are long, and horrible food is what you get.  We ordered an appetizer platter (cheese sticks, hot wings, bacon/cheese potato skins), and I am not kidding when I say they were exactly I mean exactly like something from a microwave.  You will get better apps from a microwaved frozen meal actually if you go for a higher end frozen product at the store.  I ordered the ribeye for $22.95.  medium rare. Came out well done. I mean not a shred of pink in the  meat. completely gray/white all the way through and tough.  Sent it back. I mean had it been a little pink, I would have ate it. but had to send it back.  What I got back was unbelievable--- the new ribeye looked like ahi tuna, literally seared lightly gray on both sides and COMPLETELY raw in the middle.  Sent my whole dish back telling the server to kill the meal and I would not eat here.  Serve  just said, 'Can I offer you some ribs ?... as I assume they just have a vat of pre prepared ribs they can slop out quickly.  I opted for nothing, hands down would not pay for anything here. My wife had a filet which was tough as a sirloin. She opted for the blue cheese melted crest addition.  Don't do that, what you get is a giant luke warm blob of white stuff that tastes like a gooey blue cheese like substance and ruins the steak should it happen to be remotely enjoyable.  Beans, potatoes, garlic mashed, all were of public school cafeteria quality at best.  Goal of this joint is pure volume, heard em in and hear em out, they don't care about their service, quality/taste of food, or what you have to say judging from most reviews.  Its a gut fill at best for someone low on budget but even then I imagine there are better options. I would eat at ANY fast food joint before here.  The only good thing was my meal was off the receipt so I didn't pay for it and I took $70 off the casino here at the craps table and made the waitress fetch me 3 free drinks in the process.  So I win but never again will I set foot in this joint.",

My friends got the steaks/lobster tail and ribs dishes and said they were just \"ok\". Not great but not bad. Their onion loaf and mozzarella sticks were good. It was incredibly busy and there was a wait for the table. But our server, named Suerte, was really nice and on the ball, so cheers to her. All in all, an ok meal if you don't mind the noise/crowd.",

My steak and  was so bad that it was full of fat hard to chew was so disappointed that even my sisters and my boyfriends was just as bad!! My sister mentioned to the server after he came to our table and asked us how everything was and as soon as my sister mentioned the steak was rubbery and he just ignored us and just walked away!! I will say that he also took a long time to bring us our check let alone never came back to collect the check after he dropped it off!!  I was so disappointed that I should have walked away without paying because no one seem to notice but of course I'm not a person to do that so I had to find someone to take my money so i went straight to there greeter!!   The one thing I will say is I did not leave a tip to our server!! This place already charged me enough for a rubbery full of fat no meat steak that the service did not deserve a tip!!! I will never come to any of the Tony Roma's since they are over priced anyways!!!   so don't waste your money on the Special!!!",
