My mom and I decided to eat here because we were staying at New York New York and we didn't want to walk the strip for breakfast and this was within the Hotel. We chose it because it was a traditional American breakfast and we were craving pancakes and french toast. Upon walking up the hostess was very rude. I asked if we could sit on the edge and not in the middle of the room, because we wanted a quieter spot than being smack in the middle of everyone. The hostess was rude and told us only one table was open and it was one in the middle. We sat and a few minutes later, low and behold, they started seating people on the edge, after I was told we couldn't have a table in those areas. Next, I ordered the croissant french toast. It was awful. Cold, hard, I couldn't even cut it with a fork. The french toast also had no flavor, very bland. My mom had the regular french toast, and her food was also pretty bad. Cold, no flavor and looked like her bread was smashed. It was so dreadful I called over a manager. The manager was a very nice lady. She apologized and comped our meal. The manager offered me to choose something different on the menu, but I honestly was so turned off by the whole experience I didn't even want to try anything else they had on their menu. The manager was nice and so was our waiter, other than that there is nothing good I can say about this place. Honestly, as a person who loves breakfast this is an honest review. I do not want people to waste their money here. There are so many yummy places to eat in Vegas, and the whole point of Vegas is to splurge and have fun. Skip this place and find something you will enjoy. :)",

    "text": "This place is getting 5 stars and even getting a review from me for one main reason...   ... RIch... the bartender...   We are making a 15 hour trek from CA to CO and our first stop is to blow some cash in Vegas... let's check out New York NY...   So 300.00 down the drain and down on our luck we are hungry... starving say the least... we walk around and find America.   We decide to sit at the bar ( some thing i rarely do).. watch some college football... and order up some grub. Rich comes over to take care of us.. and take care of us he does. Charming personality, and doesn't seem to get ruffled....   One thing my friend and I love to do is watch people tip. We watched him serve up things great time after time, and never flinch when gathering up his tips.. be it the 50 cent change or 2.00 for a 3.00 beverage.. he smiled, checked on his entire client group ... along the bar... often.   I like this place, good bar set up, nice sizable dining area.. and a great big map of the USA, with little symbols on each state.. probably a great place to take you kids.. should you have had to bring them to Vegas... and get a little education out of it.   The price is the price... what you would expect from a Vegas Restaurant... 2 bud light drafts, 1 Pepsi, 2 chicken sandwiches .. and edamame... oh yeah, and the food we extremely satisfying...   Like I said, RIch is 2 of these stars alone. He was great with his co-workers.. his shift ended while we were there and we hurried up and cashed out and give him what we thought hopefully made up for the lower, unappreciative, prior tips!!",

    "text": "We decided to look for a spot to eat in the wee hours of the night after a night of drinking and found this spot open 24 hours in the New York New York hotel and casino. I was easily drawn to the sign that had the post midnight special: a 16 oz. steak meal for only $11.99.  I'll take that please!  We came in and ordered fairly quickly as there were only a few people sitting in this enormous room filled with memorabilia from around the United States. I ordered the steak special which came with two sides. I ended up getting some coleslaw to substitute the vegetables and an order of the french fries.  The food came out in about 12 minutes or so, which is a good time to wait. The steak was decent. It was a litte tough to tell the truth, even though I had ordered it medium rare. Id say the steak was decent  especially for the price so theres nothing to complain about.  The  coleslaw was forgettable as were the fries.   If you're really hungry and in the area I'd say go for it, otherwise there's probably other better alternatives.",

    "text": "I debated on only 2 stars, but there are some redeaming qualities here.  Whether you like this place or not probably depends on what you order.  My wife got the dinner special which is an 8 oz. steak with 1/2 pound of crab legs, potato, veggies and a salad for $15.  Great value.  My wife liked her steak a lot and the crab legs were OK.  I got the vegetarian club which was not  that great but the fries were very good.  I got the mac and cheese before and I remember it being OK.   This place isn't expensive, but If you not getting the special then I can't really say its great value.  I can get a great vegi sandwich at the Cheesecake factory for a buck fifty more, plus this place charged $3.75 for crappy iced tea.  The only reason I gave this place 3 stars and not 2 was the good service.  My server was Neverly and he was very nice.  The hostess was very nice too.  The only reason I can see coming here is if you want the special or you are looking for a table service place where you don't have to wait.  I suppose it's a good place for kids too.  I actually wanted to eat at Nine Fine Irishmen but there was a 30 min. wait for two on a Tuesday.",

The coffee was bitter and old. The second order came with pancakes that were so hard I was only able to take one bite. As we attempted to eat the waiter looked over and could see we were not pleased then avoided us until a dishwasher came by to pick up our plates and asked if we were finished at which time I told him the food was bad. Shortly after this the waiter walked up with the check dropped it in the table and said, \" pay when your ready\". Never asking how the food was or anything, we ordered two meals and the bill came to $46!! I had to go ask for a manger where I stated what had happened, she was friendly but only took 1/2 the bill off. I then had to go spend $17 more to get food somewhere else to fill our tummies. Do not go to this place.",

We didn't eat breakfast and we went straight to our spa services which lasted for a few hours so by the time we got to the pool, it was around 2pm and we were starving.  Thank goodness for the not-so-friendly waitress walking around.  Quesadilla - A little oily but not too bad.  It would have been better probably if we ate it at the restaurant so I'm not complaining too much.  The salsa was decent and the filling was significant.  Definitely an American style quesadilla.   Would try it again.  Burger/Fries - Cooked MR and dressed appropriately.  It was a decent burger with no frills at all.  Definitely a $6 burger per Carl's Jr.   The fries were okay but I can't expect too much from pool side service fries.    Not bad but not great.   If service lady was a little nicer, it would have been a lot tastier I presume.  Who knows.  Anyway, I lived a little dangerously and went swimming 29 minutes after I ate.",

Because of the time of day we arrived, we were given the breakfast menu.  The menu seemed like your typical diner food. The only disappointing thing is that they don't offer combo dishes. I ordered the cinnamon apple waffle but if I wanted it with a side of eggs and bacon, it was an additional charge (like $4 for each item!). But maybe I'm just used to the Dennys and IHOPs and whatnot.  Servers were polite but it took a while for our meals come out. We were told that they wanted to bring everyone's meal out at the same time (keep in mind we had eleven people). Unfortunately some meals weren't as warm as others.  Despite that, food was ok. Everyone in the party seemed satisfied. The bagel and lox seemed like a popular dish amongst us.  The best thing about this experience: it was comped. Thank goodness for the gamblers in the group.",

The food was great, especially the omelets (asparagus & feta omelet-DELISH but didn't quite match the menu-few if any green onions & minimal dill) (wild mushroom omelet could have used more mushroom varieties) & pancakes, but the service lacked. The hashbrowns that accompanied the meals were excellent. The food came out quick & hot, but we were missing part of our order the first visit, delivered by a bus-boy or kitchen attendant, not our server. Our toast was missing butter. We were missing a side of bacon. We couldn't correct the issue because our server didn't follow-up until he brought the bill. The second day, service was better but our table was missing silverware (like knives for spreading jam... Which conveniently was also missing this day, but at least the bacon arrived & toast was buttered, and service was more thorough). Overall satisfied with the quality of food (4 stars), but 3 stars for the execution & service.",

What made our meal so enjoyable was not only the food but the service we received by our server Manny, that we chose to eat there several more times before we left. We don't eat at the high priced restaurants so this option was just perfect. The menu has a variety of choices from  traditional breakfast items to your favorite sandwiches, salads and even some pasta dishes!  Sounds boring but trust me when I say everything we had was outstanding! I am Gluten Free for medical reasons and Manny took the time to explain my options and there were several! They even have Gluten Free bread for the sandwich choices!  He mentioned that he has only been a server for a short time, that he used to be a cook in the kitchen. Wow, what a waste of talent had he stayed in the back of the house. He was so upbeat, professional and a joy to be served by! We will definitely be returning and will ask for him every time. If you are looking for a casual place that is not expensive and has great food options that taste even better, ask for Manny and you will not be disappointed!",

    "text": "This was the worst restaurant by far I have ever been to.  Prices for dinner are ridiculous and the food quality is terrible. They get away with it because they are located in the N.Y. N.Y. Hotel and can charge high prices for low end food.  My friend and I had dinner there recently, I had the flat iron steak and my friend had the shrimp scampi dinner. It wasn't that impressive looking at it in the dish but we thought it tasted OK not great but OK.  Service was terrible, our waitress took the order and then never checked back to see if the food was to our liking. We had to call the manager for a minor problem. We saw the waitress when it was check time.  I tasted his food and he had some of mine and we agreed it wasn't worth the price.  When we left the restaurant we both got such tummy aches we had to literally RUN TO THE NEAREST RESTROOM, and everything we just ate immediately left our body. (need I say more). Apparently the food wasn't handled properly.  After we came back from the restroom we both felt fine.  I called the restaurant and complained and also filled out a report (why) I didn't say I had food poisoning, but this was their  practice, to cover themselves just in case.  I emailed the corporate office about our experience and received a phone call from their VP whose name was Paul and he told me \"it was baloney\" I couldn't possibly have gotten sick that quickly from their food.  His manners on the phone were horrible, very loud and didn't listen to what I was telling him.  Basically he said I couldn't have gotten sick from their food and I told him unless he ate the food out of my dish he shouldn't say that.  He wasn't there watching it being prepared nor did he eat it.  Since  we both had stomach aches and rushed to the restroom after leaving the America Restaurant  it was because of the improper handling of the food.  I expected an apology but what I got was a yapping Vice President who of course believes that the America restaurant is perfect.  Nothing is perfect and if a customer complains about a problem I would think good customer service would be to apologize for a terrible dining experience.  Not so here.  So BEWARE IF YOU DINE AT THIS RESTAURANT,  YOU WILL PROBABLY HAVE TO VISIT THE RESTROOM TOO.",

After finally flagging down our waitress (the place wasn't busy at all), she adjusted it and even took off the required gratuity for our party of 8. That was pretty nice I guess.  The food was less than mediocre. Less tasty than your typical Denny's or IHOP.  I believe this is the same place where NYNY's room service comes from...based on the similarity in menus and presentation. The food is acceptable when it's the middle of the night and you don't want to get out of bed, but if you're looking for a place to have lunch or dinner...go elsewhere.  One star for the very cool ginormous map of the USA that I wish I got a picture of!",

Unless of course you're \"dining\"  at New York, New York's very own bland-a-tron.  America, is a veritable cornucopia of bad food, cheesy decor and, get this, surprisingly good service.  Yeah, go figure.   There were 8 of us eating and the majority of us all had something to say about the pathetic dishes that were brought out.  My BLT looked like it was made with bread from the local 99 cent store.  My friend Ian, who also ordered the BLT and fries, received 7 french fries on his plate.  Yes, 7.  Needless to say, we complained and got the rest of the missing fries to join his sandwich.  While the collective moans and groans at the table regarding the food were many, I found our waitress, Sigi, to be on top of her game.  It was almost as though she had a sixth sense regarding everything at the table.  Whether it was when we were placing the order or needing a refill, there she was, Joanna on the spot.  But , regardless of how good Sigi was, service only gets you so far.  So, when you're taking a break between between betting on black and rolling those dice, think twice about getting something to eat at America...it's a definite gamble.  See, what I did there?",

    "text": "After reading some bad reviews of this place, I was hesitant to try it, but am glad I did.  This restaurant is located very conveniently in the NYNY hotel and casino, right next to the main registration area.  It can be difficult in this hotel to find a decent, convenient place  for  breakfast.  The choices are not great - upscale places that are not open for breakfast or village eatery areas that are not the most comfortable for seating and also tend to be noisy. So, America was the choice for two breakfasts at NYNY.  Yes, prices tend to be high for what you get, but that's the situation with all strip locations.  My first breakfast was avocado/bacon omelette  served with sourdough toast.  It was okay - nothing to write home about, but not bad either.  The toast was buttered and rather good.  I had expected the avocado to be inside the omelette but it was served on top.  Again, nothing amazing, but it did the job. A-OK.    Some people on Yelp have complained about the waiting time and service. I didn't experience any problems at all with service.  This is a BUSY place, being  centrally located, with  few other  very great alternatives for a basic good breakfast  at NYNY, so you can imagine that the staff is kept super super busy.  Me and my guest didn't have a long wait for our food.  About normal, I would say, for the amount of people there in the morning.  So, no complaints about service.  The servers were all very nice, courteous and helpful.   We loved looking at the huge map of the U.S. suspended across the ceiling.  So fun, and great to take a photo  for your fam back home.  For the second breakfast, me and my guest searched  for a different place to eat, but gave up and came back to good ole America. We saw that they had donuts and pastries in the window out front, but didn't see anything there offhand that appealed.  So, we went in and were seated.  We both ordered their \"croissant donut\"...and OMG.  Of everything we had for three days in Vegas, those croissant donuts were the BEST THING WE HAD. That's the truth, seriously.  They  are in several flavors - cinnamon sugar, honey drizzle, chocolate or  butterfinger.  We had the cinnamon sugar and it was TO DIE FOR.  They look like big double decker type donuts, but they are light as a feather inside because they are actually croissant-type dough. If you've ever had a \"cronut\", these are similar, but way better in my opinion.  Totally addictive.  Before I left for home, I bought two more to take with me, the honey and the chocolate.  The cinnamon is my fave of all the flavors.  So, I would definitely return to America if I go back to NYNY, if only for their donuts!",

By the last day i was looking for something wrong with the place but was hard pressed to find it.   Every day the hostess was nice, even genuinely asked us how our morning was going on the way to the table. Our service was great. Even with our special requests, time constraints and what not. It was near flawless. We were always asked if we wanted a mimosa or bloody Mary even though it was like 8 or 9 am!  Now the food. Oh yea, the food! In the 4 days i went, i had Steak and Eggs, A bagel with lox, omelet with lox and 2 eggs sunny side with bacon.  In general all was well above par and blows any Denny's or IHOP out of the water.   The steak n eggs was about $15 and tasted better then many \"dinner\" steaks I've had in chain restaurants. The bagel with lox was a tad overpriced at near $11, but was delicious. The omelet with lox was good, but the lox were cooked. I sort of expected it on the side (idk why). it just tasted like a fish omelet to me. Strange but good.   If I'm back in Vegas in this area, I'd eat here again and again.",

I was expecting too much from my croissant french toast ( no sides included) and was sadly disappointed.

The restaurant boost American food fare and the decor of the place reflects that and there are plenty of seating.  We both ordered the Chicken Fried Steak and Eggs.  Originally we were gonna order all you can eat pancakes but we missed it (last serving was at 11:30 am for the AYCE pancakes @ $7.95).  Our food took awhile to be served but it was okay, the place was busy and we were busy admiring the decor of the place.  The food was good but I noticed it was a little overcooked.  Maybe it sat on food warmers before it was served to us because when they served us, they also served the other surrounding tables guests around us.  Maybe they need to hire more waiters and servers.  Now back to my train of thought, the food was overcooked, the hash browns was a little charred.  The scrambled eggs was perfect, nice and fluffy.  The other good thing was the gravy for the chicken fried steak, lots of flavor.     The THREE STARS only minus one star for location (had to walk through smoked filled casino to find this place) and overcooking our food.

Have tried many of the breakfast items on the menu but my favorite is Bagel Mania, scrambled eggs, cheese and bacon between two halves of a bagel. Can be eaten like a sandwich. Lots of good hot coffee. Service is good. Order taken and out to the table very quickly. They have a really neat doughnut shop at the front of the restaurant. The doughnuts are excellent and really addictive. Usually buy a few for takeout and eat later as a snack.",

When we walk up there's a sign of some exotic looking women and the sign said that she was working.  This was quite a draw, this women was stunning.  Although we were there for the food, why not something to look at as well.  We get seated and order some drinks.  After looking at the menu we realized that this place was just a cafe.  And where is this exotic employee?  Nowhere to be found.  BS.  A shit hole of a restaurant and misleading pictures.  I ordered the quesadilla and the lovely wife ordered the wings.  Both tasted like bar food......only worse.  I'm sure glad I had $30 left on a visa gift card otherwise I would've complained about the shit food.  The reason it was 2 stars instead of 1 is because our service was good and I was eating with a beautiful women.....my wife!  Will I again?...  most likely not. Tootles!",

We came here because it was convenient so we would not brave the heatwave, over a 100 degrees and it was only 830am.  My friend sent his eggs back because they were cold.  I finished my simple breakfast of warm eggs and potatoes.  The first round of coffee was luke warm but the refill was hot.  My other friends steak was flavorless.  For 5 of us and a bill of $136.00 they should have refilled our water glasses.  Do yourselves a favor...stay away!

As I was aimlessly walking around I remembered that there was a donut spot at NYNY I heard about and they had cronuts. Staff - one of them was clueless but luckily another came and rescued her. How hard of a question is, \"which donut do I need to try?\" You should have a favorite and if you don't you should have one that you can pretend is your favorite to answer questions just like that. I pretty much knew I was going to try a cronut but thought it was worth asking in case she was like \"OMG you have to try this one.\" Cronut - this looked more like the original cronut than the one i had at PB Doughnuts. It was really good. I thoroughly enjoyed it but it still felt like it was missing something. I guess I'll never know until I try the original. Maybe this was a dead ringer but in that case I would wonder what the craze was all about. Anyway, didn't eat anything else here but awesome little selection of donuts and I'll probably be back when I decide to go back to NYNY sometime.",

    "text": "America is located in the New York New York hotel, where we stayed for our first trip in Vegas. Convenience is the best thing about this restaurant. It was located right off the elevator of the hotel and it's open 24 hours. As of writing this review, this was our third time visiting this restaurant in four days, but not because it's amazing: just because it's there.   My sister was turning 21 so the bartender the first night gave her $1 birthday shots. Awesome. The second time we visited was a Saturday morning, and it was understandably crowded, busy, with a short wait to be seated but a really long wait to be served, however, they did what they could. It was an average cost for pancakes but the serving sizes were huge. I only ate 1 1/2 pancakes out of the three I got. Thy have an all you can eat special for pancakes and I can't imagine eating more than two. A lot of the meals at this restaurant (and honestly in Vegas in general) do not include sides and drinks which is ridiculous in my opinion.   Overall, the food was average. The most average American cuisine you could ever experience. I'm not a very adventurous eater, so if you like to stick with the classics, (burgers, fries, chicken wings/tenders) this is the restaurant for you. Average service, average food. The worst thing about this restaurant was that the frozen margarita machine was broken all three times I visited so far, and the milkshakes tasted like milk with whipped cream on top. The fries were burnt and hard as a rock both times I had them. Horrible. The highlight of this restaurant is the family friendly atmosphere and the decor which includes a giant map of the country! In the end, it wouldn't be my first choice if I ever come back.",

    "text": "After the U2 concert, my husband and I decided to grab a late-night snack. We went to America cafe, because it's open 24 hours and we had seen donuts in the storefront earlier when we were checking in at the hotel.   We arrived around 11:15 and all the donuts were gone from the display case, not because they were sold, but because they must remove them at a certain time every day?  The layout of the restaurant is strange. The room with seating is huge and there is a ginormous 3-D map of America on the wall. It feels very hollow, because it's so large, even though you can tell they are trying to create a fun space. It also looks tired and the decor is...meh.  All I really wanted was dessert, but our waiter told me they only had like two of the ten desserts available at that hour. That's pretty weird since they are a 24-hour establishment. Why am I unable to get a slice of chocolate cake at 11:30 p.m.? We ended up ordering appetizers (fries/potato skins) and a brownie sundae. About 30 minutes later, I turned to my husband and said, \"If they don't bring us our food in the next five minutes, I am going back to the room and ordering room service instead.\" It was just crazy. It's not like the place was busy. I don't know if they were short staffed or what. We also saw a few other tables with couples who looked as annoyed as we felt. In fact, one of the husbands at a table near us had asked to speak to a manager and then had a verbal confrontation with him about the slow service.   The food was fine. Nothing to write home about. I would recommend going to Starbucks across the lobby or ordering something off the late-night menu from room service before I would ever eat here again.",

My friend had the croissant French toast and was very disappointed, it was a tiny portion and apparently not very good. Worst part was the service. We arrived around 12:30pm on a Saturday and expected a lunch rush but found the place nearly empty. We were seated promptly but then waited 15+ mins for a waitress. She took our order and delivered our food without incident but then never returned to our table to refill water or coffee or even to check if everything was alright. After our plates were cleared we waited another 15+ mins to get the check. I swear I almost walked out without paying at all. Such a disappointment.",

Not much I could argue with this spot because it sure is nice having something more than a cafe to go to after a night out in Vegas!

Thought the huge USA sculpture hanging from the ceiling was worth trying to catch on camera.   Give it a try and if not for dinner, then at least for the delicious looking donuts at the entrance!",

She didn't apologize like if it was my fault she didn't get my order correct.. they offered to make the salad I wanted but declined because I didn't want to wait another 40 mins to get a salad.. the other people in my party had breakfast & still don't recommend.. the hash browns were sooo bland not even salt & pepper helped.: I do not recommend this place.. left very unsatisfied",

My boyfriend and I ended up eating here twice during our stay because it was right down the stairs from our room.  On our first visit, we ordered the BLT (applewood smoked bacon, lettuce and tomato on sourdough bread) and Corned Beef Hash & Eggs (slow cooked corned beef and shredded potatoes with onions and peppers, served with two eggs any style). Both were ok. The BLT was better than the corned beef. The corned beef was actually pretty bland, which was surprising because usually that type of dish is quite salty. On our second visit, we got the Breakfast Burrito (farm fresh eggs, black forest ham, bacon with chorizo sausage and pepper jack cheese, wrapped in a warm flour tortilla) and the King Club (roasted turkey breast, applewood smoked bacon, romaine lettuce and tomatoes on toasted sourdough). These two were a lot better than our first visit. They were good, but nothing too special about them.  The True stars of this place are the donuts. They are huge, sweet, and decadent. I mean, what isn't to love about a nice fresh donut? We got the Strawberry Shortcake (frosted strawberry icing with a vanilla & strawberry filling) and the Boston Cream (chocolate frosting and custard cream filling). I am usually not a fan of filled donuts, but these were so delicious.  The service was a little slow, but totally understandable because it was during the breakfast rush, but overall a pretty decent experience. I would go here again if I was staying in New York New York again.",

The first go around, they bring out a stack of three pancakes. After that, it comes in a stacks of twos. The hubby ate five pancakes in total. He said that the pancakes were light and fluffy.  After reading so many articles about the famous croissant doughnut, I had to try it. This was the first time that I'd seen a Cronut in my life. It's truly the best pastry that I've had in a long time. Yes, it must be really bad for you and really fattening, but it's so good. It's hollow on the inside, which makes it light and airy. On the outside, it has a sugary glaze, and is flaky and crispy. It really doesn't get much better.  I like the decor of this restaurant. While it's not fancy or sophisticated like fine dining, it's bright and clean. They have this piece of artwork that hangs from the ceiling. It's a map of the United States and has decorations of what each state is known for. Alaska and Hawaii is off to the side and have their own little section. At first when I didn't see Hawaii on the map, I was disappointed. I'm glad I looked over to the side and saw it.",

Even when I've stayed at the Bellagio, I've walked to this place to grab a good old New York steak & eggs for breakfast ($14.95). It never disappoints - straight up just simple but consistently good. The lil blueberry muffin is an added token - spoiler alert: it has apple filling inside that lil thing.   Coffee is a carafe - so, not the hottest.  I ask for salsa to tame them bunch of hash browns and and picante kick to eggs~  OJ seems fresh squeezed.  Lots of families with early teen kids. Very nice family ambience.  Christmas music in background and Christmas decorations were added touch for the holidays - today is Xmas eve - and first day of Chanukah - and the place is busy but not crowded at all.  No particular discounts for M Life members (MGM Resorts loyalty program) but you can use your player's points if you have any. Also, you can charge the meal to your room at the Excalibur, even though America is located at NY NY, just a brisk walk across the bridge from the Excalibur  Free NY NY wi-fi.  Friendly service~",

We decided we wanted dessert after our meal. Waitress bought menu and we picked a dessert. Waitress came back about 10 mins later to let us know they were out of what we picked, so we picked another dessert. Sat there for 20ish mins with no follow up or our dessert. We finally flagged down the hostess to let her know what happened. Minutes after that I see a manager bringing out our dessert, but doesn't bring it to us but to the drink service area to talk to the hostess, mind you it's brownie ice cream dessert. They talk for 5-8 mins and then the waitress brings the dessert to us and says the manager comped the dessert... but by now the ice cream is melted and is basically soup. We spent almost 2hrs there.. mostly waiting for shit to be fixed but fixed very poorly. Not the way I wanted to start my New Year. Okay, I understand that it got busier and it's a holiday.. but really no excuse for the service received at the end.",

    "text": "$20! for terrible food! Ugh!  I was very disappointed with my experience at America. During long layover I'm Vegas I decided to go on the strip for a few hours. I needed to start with breakfast. I passed up 48TH and Crepes because the line was really long and there was no where to sit. My weariness led me to make the bad choice of choosing America.  I knew going on the food was overpriced for what they were serving but i was really tired after flight. I ordered the Chicken and Waffles and after waiting 20 min for my order, even though the place was slow, I saw my food and knew right away I was going to regret choosing this place. It came with 3 pieces of chicken which could have came fron a chick they were so tiny. I could tell the chicken was bought prepared and heated up. It had that familiar orangey color diner chicken has where the establishment is too lazy to flour chicken themselves. Lots of places actually serve this chicken and it's not bad tasting but it can easily be dry. Of course those tiny pieces were far from moist. The Waffles were crunchy on the outside and fluffy in the middle, nothing spectacular about the flavor. But my guess is that any place who doesn't take pride in preparing their own chicken, probably bought the waffle mix prepared as well. Funny that the restaurant is called America, pretty ironic. Lazy, no pride in your product, over charging customers, the buck you make is more important then the goods they are pedaling.  Is that what they are saying America is?   The service was great, that's the only reason I gave them a star. Seriously how hard is it to make your own fried chicken?",

The restaurant is huge and there is a giant map of the US on the ceiling with all of the famous things about each state.  I got the salon entree with the spicy BBQ sauce on the side (I do not like BBQ sauce) and I gave that sauce to the boys which they loved and used it on their hash brown and steaks. The salmon was small and not the best tasting but the veggies that came with my plate was excellent! I even substitute my mashed potato's for them but the waitress forgot then realized it and brought me a side of veggies. The bf got the spaghetti and he didn't like it and had better. For both our entrees it cost us about $36...kind of pricey for okay food. Everyone else thought their food was okay but they did say that the jambalaya was spicy and delicious.",

Seems too many of the other reviews are high maintenance snobs who expect everything in Las Vegas to be gourmet.    This restaurant was a solid choice three times during my stay at NYNY.  The first time, we were so taken by the portions and freshly prepared food, that we came back twice in 3 days.  When my friend ordered the chicken fried steak and eggs, I expected a frozen patty drowned in gravy, instead he got a large TENDERIZED FRESHLY BREADED fried steak that covered 2/3 of the plate!    The portions are enough to keep you from eating at pricier places while you take in the strip.  We dined here at noon and literally didn't eat again until 8pm.    The staff was friendly and fun.  The manager visited the table and was genuinely interested in us and our experience.  Very refreshing, it wasn't a canned greeting, it was a conversation!  Conclusion, it's worth the stop for a filling and satisfying meal that will allows for a friendly atmosphere to unwind in before the action that is synonymous with Las Vegas.  PS- The bloody mary's were a deliciously spicy start to the meal",

The service here is very very pleasant, they are a bit slow however, happened both morning and night. I had eggs, hashbrowns, toast and orange juice. I ate everything and found it delicious. My bf was not a fan of the stuffed french toast however.   I came back for dinner because at breakfast I saw they have a $15 steak and crab leg dinner. The dinner was good for $15. It came with a baked potatoe, salad or soup and bread. The steak was average but good enough for the price. The crab legs were pretty decent not the best but good. The potato was great. The salad was average. The bread was amusing. We didnt get it right away and we asked the waitress about it and she said she doesnt bring it out unless someone asks for it because she figures it is enough food and we wont need it. Ummm, yeah give me my bread. The bread wasnt very good but my bf ate it to spite the waitress haha.   Dinner was cheaper than breakfast strangely.",

They give coffee with your own pitcher so you can refill on as much coffee you'd like. My husband is vegetarian so he ordered two eggs scrambled with hash browns, jalapenos, and pepper jack cheese. He asked for it to be extra crispy but it ended up being still soft. Regardless it was still pretty good. The eggs however were not. It did not taste like real eggs to us. He also got a tall glass of chocolate milk which made it up to my Hubby. They do let you order donuts to your table but I did not see a menu for that at the seats. We were too full to get one but there is always next time.  The ambience is great for large groups, families (the kids will love the huge 3D artwork of America), and for couples as well. There is also a bar seating with TVs if you'd like to watch news or sports.",

Tons of TVs around to watch the games going on and they also have giant Jenga and connect four and if you want they have beer pong  and of course corn hole . They have their own app that keeps track of the beers you have tried there and every 10 beers you get one free. Great atmosphere and the bartenders are really well versed in their beers . Download the app and check this place out. We didn't eat here so my review is just based on the bar it's self and they great time we had here",

The grilled veggies were the highlight of my meal since the baked potato remained mostly undisturbed and my steak was salty.

The food is always fast and fresh your not sitting around waiting what the hell is taking so long - they have a great ticket time. The wait staff is always polite and attentive.   Breakfast - One of the best breakfast places hands down, they have the most amazing croissant french toast which comes with a side of fresh pastry cream and fresh berries. They also offer a bagel and lox which is the most elaborate bagel I have ever had which could easily be split between two people and still be more than enough food. They used to have \"frosted flake french toasts\" which was my absolute favorite thing and would ditch work to go have it for breakfast every chance I got, it was recently taken off the menu but then again all good thing have to come to an end.   Lunch - They offer amazing lunch specials that satisfy any craving that one can possibly have ranging from fish and chips to spaghetti and meatballs. The lunch specials portions again are a substantial size and the price can't be beat. If your in the mood for something a little lighter for lunch then I would recommend the steak salad or salmon salad both are delicious the steak is always cooked to perfection and not overly seasoned and the salmon is never \"fishy\" or pungent and the lettuce and veggies in the salad are always crisp never wilted.  Dinner - My favorite for dinner is the Mac and Cheese it is seriously the best mac and cheese I have ever had its hands down the best in town. Only mac and cheese that even comes close is on the east coast.   Bar - The Bloody Mary is made to perfection and in ever tastes like to much vodka it even comes with an adorable American Flag tooth-pick   Doughnut Bar / Dessert Bar - offers a wide verity of doughnuts and desserts such as New York style cheese cake to chocolate mouse cake, sure to satisfy any sweet tooth.",

    "text": ".strolling through the Casinos, \"America\" caught our eye and decided to have Sunday breakfast.  I wanted to order a healthy meal so I chose the \"eqq-white omelet with the vegetable fritatta\".  The omelet was fried in oil, but it wasn't greasy.  Serving size was medium (I estimate 3 eggs worth + 1 ounce of veggies).  My meal, to say the least was not memorable, and left me a bit hungry.  So I was glad that my meal came with a bowl of diced fruit.  Servers seemed so rushed, but apologetic for being harry. I really felt so rushed and that they just couldn't wait to turn the table. Put it this way, they practically started clearing the table before I was through with my fruit bowl.  So much so that, when I lifted my arm to take a serving of fruit from the bowl, that by time my fork hit the dish, they had wisked away the fruit bowl and my fork ended up scooping air from the table.  After receiving the check, they immediately took the canteen of coffee away.  I guess that was our cue to leave.  On the way out, with our check in hand and headed to the register, we decided to admire the globe on the ceiling (which was the restaurant main feature and what drew us in). After gazing upwards for 20 seconds, the hostess snapped the check from our hand and said, \"i'll just ring you and if you can follow me, you can sign your bill\".     Price for food/experience was not good.  My small meal + coffee + iced tea came to about 35 bux.  I would definitely NOT return and also NOT recommend to friends! There are better places to blow your money on.",

    "text": "So here's the deal - the food may or may not be okay here, however the fact we had a Thanksgiving meal reservation here made us eager to find out.  We had reserved online several days in advance, and even called to confirm the Thanksgiving menu went all day.  We were told \"of course, why wouldn't it?\" which just sounded like an I don't know or don't care answer so we asked again and got \"yes, as we said the Thanksgiving menu runs through the entire day\".  Even though said with a \"now buzz off\" type tone, we at least we're now confident.  So we get there, show them the reservation and say we would like the Thanksgiving menu.  They said it did not start for 30 more minutes.  When we explained what we were told when we reserved, they said we could have the regular menu only and no we could not wait the extra few minutes to get what we had reserved for in the first place.  Poor service.  So the food may or may not be good, but it wasn't like this was 10:15am or something.  We wanted what we had been told we could get  and went off to somewhere else where we had a 5 star Thanksgiving meal, even got in at rush time with no wait or reservation.  Bad service is one thing, and I'll often forgive - misrepresentation or just not knowing is poor business.  Management here need to train their staff.  We did not go back during our trip.  We had found other great places instead, the 2 stars is me giving the benefit of the doubt they can do better on non Hoildays.",

Was incredibly delicious and the price was just right around $14. My girlfriend had the Spaghetti and Meatballs. She loved it so much we actually came back a second time to dine here. I couldn't believe how attentive the waiters were during dinner. They must have came by like 5 times to check on us. Bonus points for the waiters.   I believe we dined here 4 times during the course of our stay at New York New York. Twice for breakfast, once for lunch and dinner. The second time around I wasn't too impressed with the Philly Cheesesteak special. The bread felt very soggy and that ruined the taste.  For Breakfast, I had the New York State of Mind which is your traditional bacon, eggs, white toast with a side of fries. Their bacon strips are huge and I absolutely loved it. However they charged $5 for Orange Juice which I was not very pleased to see when the bill arrived. Very very overpriced for Orange Juice. Shame on you, 1 star off for trying to gouge the customer.  Moderately priced for all the other items on the menu and I would recommend giving this place a shot if you are looking for something traditional that you would find at most American diners like Dennys or IHOP.",

The onion marmalade was very good, the patty was soft even when it is well done (it is ground prime rib). The patty is half pound. The burger came with baked potato. The size is big that I can't finish the whole burger, while my husband finished his whole plate including the baked potato. The only down side is that I wish they would put more horseradish aioli on it.  The service was good. The waiter was sincere and polite.  Another up side is that it opens 24 hours so it is very convenient while the price isn't crazy. The decoration was very interesting too as there is a half wall made into an american map, and there is different things pinned on each state. For example, there is an alligator figure on the Florida state, and there is an astronaut figure on Texas. They have a 4-7pm rib eye special. We probably will try it next time.",

We enjoyed a variety of beverages ( double gin ceaser, baileys and coffee, tequila coffee and a baileys and butter ripple shots.  For our meal I had a bagel with cheese, Ham, bacon and egg on it. My husband had the scramble with added bacon and rye toast.   The portions were generous and tasted really great. The service was beyond excellent !

High ceilings, separate bar area with TVs where you can watch sports and a cool huge 3D map of the US on the wall.  Sort of fun to  look at while waiting.  Since there were just a few folks eating at that time, service was pretty quick so I can't speak to what it is when there is a crowd.  Server was very pleasant although once our order was taken and we got our food, never saw the person again so if there had been a problem, too bad.  Hubby had a king club, he said it was good, not wonderful.  I had a stir fry chicken salad.  It tasted good but was the oddest salad.  I think the lettuce must have walked by the dish and a few leaves jumped in because it was primarily cold noodles, shrimp, the menu said there were veggies in it, couldn't find any and topped with fried rice noodles.  The dressing was a sesame vinaigrette which was pretty good.    Think probably the better choice for eating is breakfast.  That menu looked better.",

The perfectly cooked poached egg was on top of sausage and a fluffy biscuit. I opted for the country gravy on the side. The Benedict was served with a healthy portion of hash browns and a mini blueberry muffin. Great value for 12.95!  On the way out grab one of their gourmet doughnuts.

Ambiance: Interesting decor. There is a huge decor of America in middle of room. High ceiling and huge place. There is a bar area where you can watch sports.  Food: One of the better chicken noodle soups I had where its not super salty to cover up the lack of chicken broth flavor.  We wanted sweet potato fries and our server recommended the brisket fries. Taste just like bbq meat on fries thats all it is. Its not bad though just nothing to rave about either. There is also way too many fat pieces on the meat i had to dig out. If you like all that juicy far, then this is for you.    Cost: Fair",

It was actually quite unique, but I can't recall it.  Food was really good as well! The fries I could have done without as they didn't have much flavor.

This time we were actually staying at the New York hotel so we ate breakfast here the last day of our stay. I think we got there around 8am Friday morning and we didn't have to wait at all. It's cute inside with the predominant decor being the enormous map on the walls and ceiling of..  you guessed it, America!   I had a bagel breakfast sandwich and my husband had chicken fried steak. They were both big, filling plates of decent, fast processed food. Both plates also came with potatoes and a little, tiny blueberry muffin.   I would come back again in the future especially if I was staying at this hotel. The food is big and unhealthy and exactly what I would want if I was hungover. They also have the most amazing looking donut display at the entrance and there's a few of those flavors I'd like to get in my face as well.",

However I would not come back for the food, it's very easily compared to IHOP. I had chocolate milk, which I hated because it was pre-made. I prefer milk and chocolate stirred. I also ordered the chicken and waffles- like I said, comparable to IHOP. My dad got the steak and eggs and he liked it and it looked good so that is probably the not suggestable item. Might as well walk a bit and make the trip to pay a bit less. Overall experience was meh.",

First off, I got sick eating here. That should be a red flag to people considering the place, but it honestly could have what I ordered. Wanting to be cheap I got the roast beef sandwich. The sandwich was served cold which was fine with me. But it tasted very strongly of horseradish to the point where the store bought roast beef and veggies were sort of overpowered. That was also fine. I thought it'd at least make the sandwich taste like SOMETHING, but not to long into my meal and I felt a strange gagging reflex and a rumbling in my tummy. The meat seemed to have gone bad and it was very well masked by the aforementioned horseradish. I spent the night with an upset stomach and a bit of heaving.  Just do yourself a favor when you're in Vegas and choose your dining establishment with at least as much care as you would place on a table game.",

After about 20 minutes we finally got the attention of a passing wait person, who seemed to be a supervisor, and she made it apparent to the wait staff that we were waiting for drinks.  10 minutes later we finally got our drinks, ordered, and waited...waited...I took a picture of the cool huge US map for my Yelp review, and we waited...waited...waited...it must have been about 45 minutes later, finally got our food - two American burgers with fries.  So, the food was actually very good, and we were really hungry by that point so it went fast. We paid and left.  It's too bad we waited for so long, or I would have rated it a couple of more stars. I may go back if I need extra time to rest my feet ;)",

She liked it and I thought it was just OK. Our nice lovely waitress whose name still escapes me, suggested a dessert instead of doughnuts and it was spot on.

The restaurant managed complied with the group , accommodating us in 2 large tables which was nice. We were in the back of the restaurant so we were secluded from the Casino and noise.   The service was a little slow , considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace. However the food was preorder as shared plates , so they knew will ahead of the quantity and type of food.   Food:  Appetizers:  Potato Fries - Garden Salads - Mozzarella fried Cheese.. Fried Chicken wings.. Noting spectacular. I would have expected more from a restaurant hotel. but but looking through the dated decor of the hotel in general and the restaurant in particular , I wasn't excepting much.  Main Dishes: Salmon topped with a slab of Ketchup - Fried spaghetti and Lab chunks -- Again .. Oily and loaded with Salt.. Salmon with Ketchup === Seriously [ Not even a sauce from a can ]   Desserts : Hard as a rock, brownies , Chocolate chip cakes- Cheesecakes  and fried small apple fritters.. Again .. Not Dessert worthy  High Notes: Cheap !!! If you don't want a burger at night, go there, but I can guarantee that you will be more happy and satisfied with a burger from Mcdonalds than eating at this diner.

Actually three times if you count me ordering room service my first day and this being it..  The first time was excellent!  Service was fantastic, hostess was very sweet and talked to me as I came in.  She actually seemed interested in talking and listening when I told her about my stay so far.  Coffee was delicious, good food (although I didn't love the fried eggs).  The restaurant is huge inside so there was no waiting .  Loved it!  I came the next morning and got a completely different experience.  It was actually BAD.  Waiter didn't seem concerned about getting me anything in a timely fashion.  Again, the restaurant wasn't too busy, so there was no excuse.   My food was so bad and the eggs were so runny, that I had to send them back.  And I never send food back because I feel bad.... Anyhow, I sent it back (after waiting forever to get the waiter's attention and instead I got the manager's attention). My food came back a second time partially cooked more, but still runny.  I hate the runny white part in eggs over medium.  It was pretty gross.  I couldn't eat it and was starving by then, so I just ate the toast and bacon. My toast was ice cold.  The butter wouldn't even melt on it. I was told there wasn't any creamer for the coffee, and instead they brought me a cup with milk in it.  I ended up not drinking my coffee at all.  I was ready to rip this place apart....  Then I asked the waiter for the bill since he didn't seem to get the hint that I had been sitting there forever waiting for it.  And he told me the manager covered it and not to worry about it.  Fortunately for me, I didn't have any cash and couldn't even leave him a tip.  Not that he deserved a dime.  So because the manager at least had the common courtesy to cover my breakfast, I didn't give them the 1 star I had planned.... I'm not sure if I'd come here again.....I might try it once more....",

My uncle wanted to have the frosted flakes French toast( reason we came) when we asked about it the waiters simply said I'm new and didn't even ask about it. The GM walked by so we asked her, she did let us know it was removed from the menu. We had 2 orders of country fried steak, an order of new French toast and a breakfast burrito. French toast was mediocre, breakfast burrito was horrible the steak wasn't to bad the eggs that came with both orders were cold as well has the English muffins and toast. We have no reason to come back to this place.",

I am not sure if it was language issue with her or it was late in the evening, but whatever we ordered, she mixed up a few time and we had to correct her order. Regarding drinks from the bar... it was the worst experience ever. Bartender did not know the names of the drinks and when I found recipe on Internet, he refused to make it. For suggestion on a mixed drink bartender turned way and finally when I asked for a strawberry margarita, he made a plane Daiquiri drink. When I told the waitress about it, she got mad at me. I got upset that service is awful. Bottom line the evening was ruined. If you wish to be in my shoes lol visit this place.",

We did not have food poisoning but the food did not sit well. To top it off the chicken Picata was terrible! A lemon flavor in a dish should be light, this tasted like the pasta was cooked in concentrated lemon juice... terrible! We told the server and she quickly brushed it off then ran off to get the check. She impatiently kept checking back for the bill while we finished our drinks. We will not be returning. Ever.",

We were seated right away... Of course, the restaurant was hardly busy. Only a few tables were occupied. Our waiter brought us water right away before we could ask so it was perfect. I'm sure he's seen it hundreds of times... The need to hydrate in Vegas is of the absolute importance. Ha!  I opted for the bagel mania which is a grilled NY style bagel sandwich with bacon, eggs, ham and good ol' american cheese. It was delicious not only cause I was starving at the moment but the combination of ingredients was perfect. The cheese topped off the bacon, eggs and ham. And all those things were encapsulated in a perfectly crisp on the outside, soft on the inside grilled bagel. Delicious... It was just what i needed. It came with country style potatoes. That was pretty good too.  My friend got a rib eye steak and eggs. Loved it and scarfed it like it was the last meal on earth.... Satisfied customer.  Our waiter was real cool. Bill was under $25 with tip. Yes, please... Thank you America, I luh you.",

I have to say not a lot of breakfast places around in Vegas, everyone sleeps late, this was a definite plus. Upon entering we were greeted and seated right away. The menu was pretty standard American breakfasts, makes sense place is called America, and the prices inexpensive for Las Vegas. My husband ordered the all you can eat pancakes with a side of sausage and I got the ABC omelet but as a scramble. The portions were large and plentiful and we enjoyed it very much.  The best part was our server, Jesus, like the Christ. He was fantastic and dealt with all my obvious I am a tourist questions and was patient with me and my annoying ordering habits. He was absolutely wonderful and by far the best server I met while here. We called the manager over, Kim? Rosas and had to let her know how our experience was. She was really sweet and although a BIG Patriots fan (we can't all be perfect ) we felt she and the staff needed to know they were great all around.",

Even Alaska and Hawaii are included! Anyways, the once amazing feeling of seeing that map began to fade upon being seated, where we waited for 5 minutes before being asked for drinks. The menu seemed promising, with a variety of options that showed off the multiple cultural aspects of the country. Didn't take too long to order, but our appetizer and one of the meals came out at the same time. Portions were well worth their cost, but was it worth the taste? No. Pizza tasted like it came from a Costco and shrimp scampi was undercooked. Don't plan on the chicken soup unless you like dark meat. Overall, we were somewhat lucky, the people next to us got so fed up they left before their food got there, after waiting longer than us even though we sat down  after them. I'm willing to bet that this place rides on their all day breakfast and all you can eat pancakes during the morning, because everything else was NOT too good to be True. I'd like to thank our waitress, Karen, who did all she could and made sure we were compensated for our poor experience. Also, pretty cool donut display, as pictured.",

Not that there is anything wrong with eating here at the America inside New York New York, but being in Vegas, there are so much other better dining experiences you can't get in your hometown. So why waste it on simple diner food? If I was a local then this would probably be a good place to just relax and dine at.  But if you have no choice, don't worry. I had the Prime Burger, which is a Half pound ground prime rib, Swiss cheese, red onion marmalade, demi glace and horseradish aioli served with french fries. Everything tasted great and I had really no complaints.   The place is huge, but never got crowded. They have a cool map of the United States hanging above. It's like a 3D in your face map, so something cool to look at, or entertain your kids with as this would be a great place to dine with your family.  The menu is not overwhelming. There are times you hope the menu has so much stuff it overwhelms, then we complain. Then when it doesn't you have that feeling to still complain and wonder, \"thats it?\" There are plenty of selections, from salads, to soups, sandwhiches, entrees, etc. **YELP TIP** CHECK OUT THEIR WEBSITE FOR THE MENUS  There is a nice simple bar within the restaurant entrance if you want to get your drank on without being in a crowded place. It's INSIDE the NY NY, so you do have to go through the casino, but it is simple to find.   Would I eat here again? Sure! However, would I actually go here again? Only if I had to.  BTW, Great staff. Very friendly and not robotic in personality.  OPEN 24HRS",

Midafternoon on a weekday, it wasn't busy and this was just what we needed, even though we didn't feel like a high-priced Vegas lunch bill.    But weekdays from 1130 to 3 they have Daily Specials, two entree choices available for $9.95.  On Thursday the Shrimp and Chips basket was one of the specials, and we both had that.  This was a good deal: lots of fried baby shrimp and fries in a generous size basket, and the quality was pretty good.   A relaxing lunch location with good food and non-Strip prices!",

They have a $15 rib eye steak, which was delicious and served with a tasty side of grilled vegetables. I ordered the shrimp scampi for myself. It was a very generous portion, and they did not skimp on the shrimp! The only negative feedback I have is the service. After we received our food, we wanted to ask for A1 steak sauce, but our server immediately left our table and we couldn't get the attention of another server for almost 5 minutes. Nonetheless, we still returned for breakfast the next day. I ordered a lox bagel and it was one of the best I've ever had! They gave me a generous portion of lox (more than I could eat), onions, capers, lemon slices, and tomatoes. The bagel was thick and toasted perfectly, and the cream cheese was whipped and light. 5 stars for the food! I am so happy to have found a new reliable food spot in Vegas, especially one that is always open!",

The bread they give you was nice & hot! I'm a bread fan so I enjoyed it. Got chicken tenders which were really good. Boyfriend stuffed rigatoni with a bolognese sauce - which he thought was just ok.   This place was okay - definitely not my favorite but not bad either.

    "text": "So, it's 4 a.m. and you're drunk and stuck inside the New York, New York Hotel. You're a 15.00+ cab ride away from your hotel down the strip and you have no cash, your friends are borderline vomits, you're wearing a $500 dress that's sopping wet from a naked hot tub party that seems like a distant memory (wait, naked? how was my dress wet?) and the only thing that's going to keep you alive is a cup of coffee and some buttered toast. Where do you go? You go to America, the only restaurant that will cater to your busted, drunk ass.   We ordered sausage, eggs and toast, a pot of coffee, chicken fingers and nachos. Someway or another, the grand total of the bill was $60, not  including tip. This is for crap I probably could have bought at 7-11 for $10.00 or less for the same quality. I guess when you're drunk and rambling, you have to pay extra for someone to try to decipher the shit coming out of your mouth.   The service here is terrible. It's because the people who work here hate their lives and it's evident in their lack of facial expression. Some may be suicidal, I mean, if I was working there at 4 am trying to talk to drunk people who have no idea what they're doing or saying, I'd probably think off-ing myself would be a good idea, too.   The only thing worth mentioning is that fucking gigantic map of the US. I've been to America a bunch of times, the most recent time being the basis of my review - but that shit is funny when you're sober, when you're drunk, when you're high, and I'm sure if I ever did shrooms or any sort of hallucinogen, I would want to come here and just stare at it.   So what I'm trying to say is, don't come here for the food - you come here when you've hit rock bottom with your partying and you need to chill the fuck out with some really greasy, crappy food. Expect to pay a fortune for food that some dog probably shit out a few hours earlier. That's all I really have to say.",

We went here last year for St. Patty's Day - they have a great menu of roasted potato soup, corn beef/cabbage/carrot/potato and creme brulee for dessert.  LAST YEAR we were served Guinness with green sugar rimmed glasses and the bartender gave us green beer (although they supposedly weren't allowed due to a mess on the bar the previous year).  Our waiter was GREAT!  Jump ahead exactly 12 months.  We returned for a repeat of the great time we had in 2010, however, we were met with HORRIBLE service and a bartender who REFUSED to add sugar to our Guinness!!  REFUSED!  I have NEVER been refused something so simple, plus they set precedence for it the previous year.  MARY was the bartender and BONNIE was our server - UGH!  NEVER AGAIN!  I even showed Bonnie a photo of my beer on my phone with the \"America\" napkin under it.  She really didn't care.  She also only checked on us once the entire 2 hours we were there, and we had to hunt down people to get us refills on drinks, and pay our bill.  The table next to ours agreed with the bad service when they had to yell for someone to take their bill, too.  The food was okay, the presentation of the corned beef/cabbage was much nicer last year.  And the dessert was blah.  We will be finding ourselves a new place to enjoy St. Patty's day and spend our money next year.  NYNY can kiss my Irish bootie!",

So America it was.  The service late at night is awful, the bar drinks take FOR EV ER (and cost too much), the prices are crazy high for the quality of the food, and the overall vibe is kind of sucky too.

On the plus side the sauce was very good and plenty of it.  The eggs were the most perfectly poached eggs i have ever had.  On the bad side the muffins were burned, the hash browns were tiny and flavorless, and the ham for the Benedict was literally a single slice of deli ham that was thin enough to read through.  The menu stated that Ii was supposed to get toast so i asked for wheat toast which the waitress repeated back but i never got it.  When i asked he about it she said the muffin was the \"carb\".  I pointed out it was o the menu and she said the menu is a misprint.  The coffee was not good, but they do leave a full carafe of it and offer a to go cup.  The highlight of the dish was a single slice of grilled tomato which was very tasty.  Wish i had just gotten a dozen of those!",

The hostess said that it was currently breakfast so we could not sit for lunch.  She told us to wait at the bar and she would come get us around 11.  She never did and we kept staring at her, but she wouldn't seat us.  Finally, we got up waited in line and she gave us a table!  I ordered the nachos and the veggie burger.  They were bland and not what we expected from a restaurant in Vegas.  The service was equally poor.  I asked for mayo and never got it because we had about 4 waiters.",

    "text": "America is the 24 hour casual restaurant in the NY NY Hotel and Casino.  The theme is everywhere with a large hanging map of the US in 3 dimensions.  There are enlarged postcards of various places in the US.  It's the theme and it works.  I stopped for dinner here before the Vegas Strong Benefit Concert at the arena nearby.  The restaurant was almost empty.  Service was attentive and I had the idea it would be just as attentive if the place was half full.    I ordered an iced tea and the Miami Press.  The menu states it as: \"shaved pork and ham with Swiss cheese, pickles, mustard, and mayo on a grilled Telera roll.\"  I expected the sandwich would be pressed but that was just the name.  It was not the Cubano type sandwich I was expecting.  Nevertheless, the sandwich was good.  The meat piled high and the Telera was good.  It was also a good amount to eat.  But having seen their desserts when I walked in, there was room for one small dessert.  I got the New York Nights--chocolate sabayon with chocolate dacquoise and raspberry coulis on a short dough base.  It was a perfect way to end the meal.  My server, Neverly, was around to attend to anything I needed and he was quite a pleasant fellow.  By the way, locals, there's a 10% discount for those of us smart enough to live here.  Use it and enjoy.    This is a pretty good 24 hour coffee shop with an added bonus of a theme that stands out all over.",

Crazy looking at the old guy crossing the Delaware. To see Lattice Apple Pies in Alabama . The alligator in Florida. I really could relate to every state.  The Ham & Egg Cheese Omelet was Hot, Tasty & Well worth The Wait. After having tummy issues for the last 36 Hours. This was a warm welcome scary delight. It stayed down.

I had to scrap off all of the sauce on my little appetizer plate. The brisket meat it self wasn't really anything to write home about. I did like the hot link. But I will not order another platter just to have a hot link for $22.  My husband ordered the fish n chips which were good and something worth ordering.  Our server was polite and professional.

And on the arrival of my choice of a hot chocolate, its taste was like an expensive, high quality imported brand. My wife agreed after taking a sip. I love hot chocolate and this was one of the best I've ever had.  For our breakfast I ordered the Corned Beef Hash and Eggs, which I requested scrambled. Hash Browns and toast (sourdough) were also included. Jackie had the Build Your Own Omelette and requested turkey sausage, substituted for the pork. Outstanding breakfast and huge portions.

    "text": "I ate breakfast at America with my family of five (husband, mother, and two children).  Between the five of us, we have the full spectrum of tastes and preferences when it comes to breakfast, so the fact that we enjoyed our meal is a sign of a pretty good place.  First of all, we arrive just after 8:00am and we were seated right away on a weekday in the summer.  We were given a large round table at the rear of the restaurant.  To be honest, I was pretty surprised at the size of the restaurant.  From the casino floor, what catches your eye is the captivating display case with row after row of amazing donuts and other sweet treats.  You can also see the host stand.  When you walk in, the restaurant is pretty expansive.  Just a few steps in, you can see the very cool decor they have hanging over much of the dining area.  It is a large model of the continental United States, with Alaska and Hawaii hanging on the wall.  It is a 3D model, so familiar landmarks are highlighted with cool little structures and lights.  For example, there is a small Golden Gate bridge in San Francisco, and a Space Needle in Seattle.  My kids loved it.  On to the food...  The kids had donuts.  Haha.  The adults enjoyed the breakfasts.  I had a waffle, which came with powdered sugar with butter and syrup, but they do provide fruit toppings as well for an additional fee.  Portion sizes were fair and food came out quickly.  At the time we were there, some kind of construction was happening right in the restaurant, which was interesting.  The sound of drills and the scent of sawdust accompanied our meal.  It actually wasn't too bad, and I share that only because it looks like they are going to have some other feature there, so I'm curious to go back and check it out.  Overall, this is a convenient place to have a meal if you are staying at the NYNY Hotel for several days.  If you are here briefly, there are so many other places to eat that I'm not sure this would be the first place on your list.  However, if you find yourself here for a meal or stopping by for a donut, I think you'll have a good time.",

For a place that is breakfast/lunch diner food, max is usually 4-stars.   This is diner food with really nice decor.  The ceiling has a fairly spectacular 3D map of the USA with lights and carved figures representing various cities and the local culture on the map.  I won't even try and describe it.  You want to see it.  It very cool.    The menu showed standard diner breakfast fare.  Omelettes, steak and eggs, bennies, etc.  The California Eggs Benedict looked interesting as the ham was subbed for bacon, with the addition of tomato, avocado and cilantro.  My girlfriend and I decided (as big Bennie fans) to try it.  Our plates were delivered on covered dishes (fancy!).  The shredded hash browns were deliciously buttery and were centre of plate flanked by each egg combo.  The eggs were perfectly done and poachn water, not basted or made with a poacher.  The whites fully cooked and the yolks an orange creamy liquid. The avocados as perfect: soft, creamyand full of flavour.  The hollandais was exceptional.  Creamy, subtly lemony, buttery and slightly sweet.  The sensation of all this on the tongue was heavenly!  Beer selection (this is a 24hr place in Las Vegas) was very good.  Roughly 16 taps with a good mix for most tastes.  Service very friendly and personal, quick and efficient.    Best Bennie ever.  Highly highly recommended.",

My New York steak was surprisingly cooked quite nicely. Even my hash browns wasn't bad either.  They even serve fresh squeezed orange juice which tickled my fancy.  Coffee however was so-so but good service made up for it.    Also, I like their funky decor with the USA map displayed when you look up at the ceilings.  Great conversation piece especially if you're having breakfast alone.  Hahaha!!  Don't forget on your way out to purchase a few donuts.  Their vanilla old fashioned glaze was fantastic.  Best of all, they're open 24 hours.   Cheers!",

    "text": "Probably one of the most horrible places we've been to in Vegas. The only reason we came here was because we all drove 5 hours and were dying of starvation... literally!  First off, the service was horrible. The place was vacant and probably had 15-20 customers max, so I thought we were going to be tended to promptly. Nope we were wrong. We had to hail the waitress from across the room after we waited 10 minutes of getting seated. Did I mention we were dying of starvation?  The food finally came and it kept going down hill from there. Here's a few of the dishes we tried:  -Steak & Crab Legs: The Steak was so tough and gritty, it took my cousin almost 20 minutes to finish her steak. The Crab was still frozen. There were icicles still inside, inedible.   -BBQ Ribs: Not bad, but not that great either. This was probably one of the mediocre dishes we had  -Salads: We ended up getting a few of the salads (Asian Salad?). They were all horrible and had no taste what so ever.   -Turkey Sandwich: How can you go wrong with a sandwich, it wasn't bad.  Over all, this place deserves a 2 star rating entirely. We won't be back here again. I did like the fact that the manager did comp us some donuts , which were horrible also. BLAH!",

That being said; America is a safe choice when trying to accommodate several people.  We were here about 9pm on a Friday night, and it was a ghost town.  Seriously, a Friday night on the Strip, and there were only two other groups of people.  The service was slow.  Ridiculously slow.  The waitress so very nice and attentive so it was not her fault it took an extremely long time for our food.  I'm not sure what was going on it that kitchen.  Maybe the waitress was actually cooking also. Who knows?   For an appetizer we had the ahi tuna and watermelon, and I had fish and chips for my dinner.  Very basic dishes.  Nothing outstanding or beyond my expectations.  But the Canyon Rose cocktail I had was awesome as was the Kamikaze shot.  Waitress: great, Food: average, Speed of Delivery: horrible.  I will not return because they are many other restaurants on my list.",

The food was mediocre, our Breakfast Burrito didn't have chorizo as stated in the description but was still ok. The Grown Up Grilled Cheese can be skipped completely as it is a greasy hot mess. The Sriracha Shrimp was basically tempura shrimp sprinkled with drops of Sriracha and marked up. The drinks were good, those were the only thing we did finish. Definitely not a place to return and not worth the almost $60+tip we spent on our meal.",

The wait staff was nice but the food was meh. I ordered mashed potatoes with gravy and did not feel so hot afterwards. My friends' food was ok...the chicken wings were the standout among them. But hey, beats my last Vegas trip where I was too tired to go anywhere else for food in the wee hours than McDonald's. If you're on this end of The Strip, I'd say this is a solid late night option. During normal hours though...I wouldn't chance it.",

We decided to go for an early dinner tonight and boy!  It was good food and great service!  I want to say his name was Nick, he was an older gentleman but he didn't miss a beat!  As the host sat us down he came over right away and introduced himself and said he'll be right with us.  In a moment he came right back and got our drink orders and also told us about the 10 oz steak he has for tonight but it wasn't on the menu.  We ordered two of those specials, a BBQ pulled pork sandwich, a kids spaghetti and a kids burger.  Everything was on point.  My boys loved their food, husband was happy - cleaned his plate! - and I was satisfied with my pulled pork sandwich.  I didn't finish it because it was a big sandwich with coleslaw and melted cheese.  Mine was served with a side of fries, and so was my boys burger.  The steaks were served with a baked potato and a side of veggies.  The veggies were cooked and seasoned perfectly!  Most places we go to are ALWAYS over seasoned, but this was perfect!    He saw that my boys were out of their drinks and came and asked them both right away if they wanted a refill.  We didn't even have to flag him down.  He's really attentive!  I also forgot to mention that the manager even came out to ask how our meal was.    It would have been five stars if it wasn't for the donuts that I bought yesterday, but overall, I would definitely come here again and ask to sit in Nick's section.  Best service ever!",

But when it came out the portions were enormous. We ordered 3 plates: steak and eggs, chicken fried steak with eggs, and a regular two eggs with bacon. All orders come with hash browns (yum!), choice of toast, and a petite apple muffin (so cute).  Food was good for what we expected, and prices were decent. Not sure if the steak was ribeye, but it was sooo tender and juicy. The chicken fried steak was perfectly seasoned and hash browns were crispy not greasy. I felt we got our money's worth. Service could've been a bit more attentive, but it was a busy sunday morning in vegas, when many people just want to eat and head out. They had so many varieties of donuts in the front counter that looked delicious, but we were too full to try any. Will definitely come back for breakfast if we're in the area.",

All were gloved up going though the trash in the back area. I had no words for how amazing this staff was!!  A member of their staff clearing tables saw the tickets and set them aside!  I got my tickets and I have to say I LOVE AMERICA AND NYNY!   The staff throughout our stay was awesome! The food was great and I have a fond  place in my heart for them as they go all out to satisfy!!",

We were hungry but not starving so we wanted to grab something quick to eat. We walked by the America Restaurant and the cronut's at the entrance basically welcomed us in. We were quickly offered a table to sit at. The place itself is interesting looking. There is a HUGE United States 3D map. Looks pretty cool and it is def something to stare at for a while. The restaurant is pretty big but to my surprise was pretty empty too. We decided to just order appetizers and our waiter took our order. We ordered the potato skins because it caught our attention being that it had chorrizo. Took quite some time before our order came out, too long for a place that was empty and for an appetizer. The potato skins were interesting and unfortunately a bit on the luke warm side rather than hot. It tasted like it had refried beans, chorizo and sour cream. The chorizo was pretty good and it made the plate worth it. The price was fair and service was alright. As far as going back, probably not. We decided to not get a cronut on the way out since the food was just ok, we didn't want to risk a disappointment. The restaurant is sort of like a diner so if you are looking for diner food, they have it here. I did see a couple next to us share a sandwich and fries and boy was that a large order.",

It's basically IHOP with a better menu and a pretty low penalty cost for substitution.    This place is huge though, so even with a line, you'll be seated within 10 minutes at almost any hour.",

Never asked if we needed anything or refills on our drinks. My husband ordered the ABC Omelet. He said for the price it was very small portioned. But also the home fries you could barely taste some seasoning and the omelet was BLAH!! I got the buttermilk pancakes (3) with a side of sausage links. The pancakes covered my entire plate, golden brown and sure soaked up my maple syrup!! They were ok kinda dry. I don't like my pancakes swimming in syrup and they were not and I still needed more syrup to make them wet looking. My sausage links I did like the flavor and they were good. We then sat there for a good 20 min waiting for our check and someone else came and gave it to us not our waiter. For all we got it the cost was $32 and change!! Not impressed will not be coming back.",

Needing a breakfast fix, wifey and I strolled up, after noticing that the room was at least 3/4 empty.   Figuring that this place was a safe bet, we sat down for a quick bite. Shortly after we were seated, we saw that the NBA finals were on, but with no sound, and he big 'ol closed caption lines over the scoreboard.  So, we asked the waiter upon taking our orders to make them to go - we would be watching the game in our room.  Our order - breakfast burrito and pancakes - took 25 goddam minutes. Even after the wait, being in generally good spirits, we were only mildly annoyed. All we had to do now was pay the bill and get out.  However, that sentiment quickly turned, considering that after we received the food, our waiter didn't come back with the check.   5 minutes pass... As I'm getting up to walk out with my free food, my wife grabs what appeared to be a manager, and asked him for our check. He brings the check, we provide our card, and he, too, decides not to come back. WTF?  I ended up walking the check to the front so the manager could complete the transaction... then guess who decides to show up? The stupid goddam waiter! How've ya been, bud?  He approaches me as I'm walking back to our table and says, \"Is everything okay?\"  No, prick. I'm missing the finals.  To wrap it all up, the meal we had in our room was indicative on the \"wish it were mediocre\" service. Dry breakfast burrito, and pancakes that were crispy like waffles on the edges.   So yeah, this place sucks. If do come back, I'll be totally hammered so I can vomit on the tables after I eat.",

Her hustle deserves a better forum in a better establishment.   Ian did indeed get six fries. It was embarrassing for everyone and I felt bad for the dude. And overall, the food was sub-par and America brought out the weirdness in everybody: Jeff - who is 6'5, was hungover and routinely eats like a garbage disposal - couldn't take more than a bite of his veggie sandwich. The bathroom was outside in the casino and it was weird with eight of us shuffling in and out of America for fifteen minutes at a time. The kitchen took too long to bring out our food.

I noticed many of the unhappy Yelpers  complained about the breakfast service and food, so that may be why our experience was much better since we went during dinner on a weekday night.  Our server was Tha and he was very professional and made sure we were taken care of.  They had a kids menu complete with crayons which made our son very happy.  He brought out juice in a kids cup also which was a plus since we were inside a casino and have not found many places that catered to children during this trip.  The large 2-D map on the ceiling captured his interest for a long while too.  We ordered the kids cheeseburger and fries for our son, which came on a wheat bun and served with potato wedges.  The bf ordered a patty melt and fries.  I had the catch of the day, very fresh grilled salmon in a chili glaze with seasoned rice and fresh sauteed vegetables.  I was hungry and the portion was a bit small, so a cup of soup or salad included probably would have satisfied me.  The cousins ordered nachos and the steak and crab leg special which they did enjoy.  We were able to catch up with each other for over 2 hours without feeling rushed.  This is one of the few places we will return to when wanting to eat at a restaurant inside any casino.  The food is decently priced, fresh, and tastes decent.  When we used our comp to pay for our bill, Tha never bristled like a few of the servers at the other places did.  Since he provided excellent service, he received a large tip.  That is what servers need to realize, even though the meal is comped, if you provide good service, most people will still tip you, and leave much more than usual since they did not have to pay for the meal.  I used to be a server so I know this for a fact!  It is all about the attitude and service next to the food.",

After passing many unworthy eating establishments on our 2.5 HOUR trek down the entirety of the strip (complete with a stop to purchase Dr. Scholls shoe inserts after developing blisters), the BF and I reluctantly sat down in a semi-fancy restaurant at the MGM. I took a look at the multicultural, Californian, fusion menu that I would normally exalt in and said, \"...I kind of just want some American food.\"  BF sighs. We forced our aching feet to carry us across the street to New York, New York, dedicated to a city we should have known we could depend on in the first place, and like a beacon in the night saw this place called flat-out \"AMERICA.\" Complete with textured map of the United States on the ceiling. If there is a god, she must know what it feels like to NEED a milkshake at 4am.   This is the first time that I have ever paid more for a salad ($14 for southwest-inspired chicken salad) than my BF paid for his steak and potatoes dinner ($12), but I was so happy to get that salad and malt milkshake into my stomach that I didn't mind.

And then we got the pancakes - these were the driest things ever put together - more absorbent than a Sham-Wow.

    "text": "Ack... really really not impressed. It was about 9pm on Friday night. The restaurant was only 1/3 full. We had to wait like 20mins for them to put 4 tables together for our group of 9.   Finally got seated and took another 10mins before was had to flag down our waiter for water. Then had to flag him down again to take our order. Then another good 30 mins to get our food, which was a turkey club, 4 burgers, a fettucini alfredo, pepparoni pizza, and 2 chili cheese fries.   Now I'm not usually a stickler about service and stuff... but considering the place was only 1/3 full, and we were the only table that was recently seated in the last 30 mins, I was surprised at how slow things were.  After all the waiting, we were still underwhelmed by the food. The local Denny's is better then this place, and (depending on which Denny's) faster. The only thing that was on the good side was the chili cheese fries, but for me, it was still only so-so b/c I'm not the biggest fan of wedge fries, which is what they used. But it was decent since it was smothered with chili and you were weren't left with 1/2 a plate of plain fries and no chili in the end.   I'd say pass unless there's nothing else. Maybe the breakfast food is better?",

    "text": "America is all about big portions of comfort food, served in a casual atmosphere 'round the clock.  It meets its goals.  We made a reservation and our table of four was seated immediately.  Our waiter, Rich, showed up right away and gave us a rundown of the alcohol menu.  I had a great cocktail and my friends shared a bottle of reasonably-priced wine.    We were all pleased with our food.  We shared an order of edamame (dee-lish!) and a caprese salad (yum!).  The starters arrived promptly.  For my main course, the cobb salad did not disappoint.  The veggies were fresh and the bacon crisp.  It was a good cobb.  My sister had the cedar plank salmon, and it was perfectly cooked.  My friend had a salad with tuna, and she liked it.  My other friend devoured her cheeseburger in a matter of seconds, and had quite the smile on her face.  The four of us shared the hot-fudge brownie sundae for dessert.  Seriously THE BEST hot fudge brownie sundae I have ever tasted.  The brownie was moist, soft, chewy, with just a few nuts.  The fudge was thick and rich.  This sundae was AMAZING.  Just remember that the bottom of the ice cream dish is coated with hot fudge, so don't ignore the bottom of the bowl!  I can't say enough about our waiter.  Rich is my newest crush.  Turns out he's so good at what he does that he's been promoted to bartender.  Plus, he looks like a young Kevin Bacon / Nick Nolte / Gary Busey (when he was young and handsome) hybrid, so we gave him a hard time all evening.  We enjoyed our dining experience here.  No frills, decent food, crazy portions and great service.",

My service asked if I wanted something to drink within a few minutes of me sitting down to the table, she was friendly and helpful. She let me know what kind of drinks they had, of course ice tea was perfect for me, within the time she needed to get my drink I was able to look at the menu and decide what I wanted to eat, I decided on then chicken fried steak, I figured it would be hard to mess that one up.    During the time I had placed my order my server made sure I had refills and asked if she could bring me anything, I did not need anything, but I did have a question on the huge map on the ceiling and what was some of the items on the map, she did not know, but it was fun talking about what it could be.    When my food arrived, it was fresh, hot and tasty.  I know the food it not 5 stars Restarurant quality, but I was very happy with my meal, and the cost of the meal was reasonable for what I had.  If you are looking for good food without breaking the bank (guessing that is what the casino is for) then this is a good place to eat a good meal.",

I expected so much more from a restaurant in the New York New York casino...  never again!  We came for breakfast, not sure what the other food is like but maybe that's what keeps them going.  When we arrived, the bored, angry looking hostess looked at the four of us standing there (only people for miles) and said \"Two?\"  Lame!!  When I said four she gave a heavy sigh and rolled her eyes because she had to take one step backwards to grab two more menus!  Holy moly, we should have turned around right then and there!  Our waitress was no better although at least she kind of maybe almost smiled once!  She too was tired and droopy and acted like it was a real chore to take our orders.  It's not like she did anything else so I'm not sure why she was so tired!  The food was absolutely horrible!  I got the ABC Omelet and it was dry with very chewy bacon bits, just a little avocado and no cheese to be found.  The hashbrowns were ridiculous to say the least and burnt just as bad as the toast.  My husbands Eggs Benedict was the biggest joke!!  There were no egg whites to speak of and the teaspoon of hollandaise sauce on each egg was pathetic.  His hashbrowns were a little better than mine but still, way over done and dry.  My daughter got the Red Velvet Pancakes and barely ate 1/3 of them!  They were dry no matter how much syrup she put on them (not sure how that happens) and basically just made your mouth stick together so you couldn't take another bite without taking a drink of something.  Something needs to be done about this place, seriously!  With such bad service and bad food it's hard to believe something hasn't been done already.  If you're smart, you'll either go somewhere else or grab donuts and coffee at the entrance and turn around and walk away!",

We probably couldve driven to Summerlin and been eating before out dinner came out here.   SERVICE: ALARMINGLY SLOW. Couldnt believe it took SOOOO long. We got there around 645. It took over an HOUR to get our food. The place was kinda empty. I ordered a cobb salad and he ordered rice and shrimp. last time I ckd shrimp cooks really fast? so I dont knwo what took an hour other than poor communication.  Theres someone to give you water, theres another person to give you your food, theres a differen person to take your order. We saw the water girl way more than we saw our server, which at this point we decided they jsut forgot to turn in the order and that must be why it took that long. the table in front of us had more people, sat down after us and ate and left and we still had yet to take our first bite. sad.   FOOD: the plate was ok, not anythign I'd order again. THe bacon was good and crunchy which I like but oh so greasy. . to the point it made me sick. i wasnt alone... my bf felt fine till I gave him a bite of the bacon oops I mean grease with bacon. ah .. lets put it this way. the food @ Hard Rock Cafe was way better and we all know they arent known for great cuisine.   would I come back? no I would not.

    "text": "Here's the scenario: It's 4am on a Monday and I just walked off the craps table at NyNy resort uber hungry. The food court is closed and the only place open within close proximity is this place. I instantly fear the abhorrent midnight mediocrity that is the standard for most late night casino eats however this place is a welcome surprise for late night eats.   I ordered the 15.99 rib eye steak late night special; medium rare with a loads baked potato and the lady ordered the monte cristo sandwich.   Food quality was very good.  The steak was a generous ribeye cut and it was actually cooked as requested. (I say that because you can't ask for the world when ordering late night steak specials) Needless to say, its probably the best steak I've had at 4am .   The lady's Monte Cristo was as awesome! The French Toast was well cooked (meaning not runny eggs/sloppy or burnt ). It was the a great marriage between breakfast and lunch in your mouth at 4 am.   As expected the service and food came out slow. (This is expected when you are dining at 4am) however the server was very friendly and accommodating so it really was not an issue at all.   I don't know if we lucked out but I can seem to understand how this place has so many bad reviews? This place is much better than most late night casino eats.   I say eat with confidence; especially at  4am",

This night was a little blurry for me, not sure how we heard of this place but thank goodness it was open 24/7!  The place was pretty empty and we were seated right away. I ordered the Empire State Plate which came with eggs (over easy), bacon, sausage, hash browns and toast. Our food came out pretty quick and I loved my runny eggs with the oh so buttery toast. The bacon was super crispy, just the way I like it. Keep in mind that I'm still a drunken mess but the food was good. I think the only thing I didn't finish were the hash browns, they were a little too mushy for me even in my state of mind.  After we got our food, I think service was pretty slow. From what I remember when we got the bill we just put the money at the table left. In a sober state of mind, I probably wouldn't come here but this place filled my tummy and I was happy.",

Located inside New York New-York is a restaurant open 24 hours called America.  The theme is exactly that where there's a giant model of America floating above with states labeled according to specialty.  Our first visit was at 4am in the morning with only one other group in the restaurant.  There was a sign that advertised a 16oz Ribeye Steak Special for $12.99 from 12am-5am. Are you kidding me!  Forget the steak and eggs, get me the special! I ordered the Special, rare of course.  This steak was big!  It took up half the plate and was plump and juicy!  My steak was cooked perfectly!  A steak like this can easily go for $20-$25.   Check it out!  You won't be disappointed.",

Thought this place had closed down in NYNY over the years, glad it's still around, as I was leaving the roller coaster I literally ran into it on my right side by accident.   What I remember about this place is that I had a plain dish of spaghetti (but it was very good spaghetti) with butter and parmesan cheese. The unbelievable part is that I believe this was under $5. Seeing this was 15+years ago, it certainly could have been. I had ordered this to go as there were some strange dudes at the counter but then again, it was past 2am.   This time around, the menu is missing that dish above, but had some other options you would expect at a diner. Prices have obviously risen with the times as well. But if you are looking for something simple and familiar, give 'America' a try.",

We had nachos which were similar to something at a local bar - nothing special nor tasty.  There was also a steak special, which seemed to good to be True.  It was.

I ate 3 because I was wearing jeans LOL.

But, thankfully a kind staff worker turned it into the security station so I was able to buy myself more donuts that day! You HAVE to try these donuts! They will speak for themselves! Come before night time because the bakery section IS NOT 24/7 like the main diner! I have nothing to say about the other donuts because I only eat the chocolate cronuts. I'm also allergic to peanuts so I can't try the butterfinger one, but my boyfriend who HATES dessert likes them a lot so if you want your girlfriend to love you more, go buy her these! I'm also heading to Vegas in 6 days and you know this is my first stop!",

I came on a Friday night and let me tell you, the service kind of sucked. My best friend and boyfriend ordered the chicken quesadilla and I ordered burger sliders. I have never tasted such bland food before. The sliders were so unseasoned and my boyfriend and bestfriend said the quesadillas were not that good. Hardly any flavor to it at all. The chicken was supposed to be marinated with lime. WRONG. Not even close. Just an unseasoned chicken quesadilla with no flavor. The only good food here was the fries. That's it.  Decided to give it another try for room service just to see- oh boy was I wrong. I ordered the grilled cheese sandwich and my boyfriend ordered an omelette. Grilled cheese was disgusting beyond belief and had old green peppers on it. Who puts green peppers on a grilled cheese?! Also, the omelette had no flavor. Even the meat inside was so bland. I was really hoping for good food when I came to this restaurant but was extremely disappointed. Teach the chefs how to season the food. Even though the food was a decent price, it's not worth it for how low quality of food they serve!",

But they really don't care because they get automatic tip. Waithelp were crowded by the bar a lot talking and laughing and a lot of empty, unbused tables around us as we ate. Quite unsightly.

So when I ask to substitute a muffin for toast, and pay the $1 difference (the price difference if you order them a la carte), and this isn't okay, it makes me really wonder about where their brains went.  It is a little detail like that which is the difference between True hospitality and a restaurant that is just out to make a buck.  Also, I was really bummed about that muffin :)",

James was our waiter and he is THE BOMB! We tipped him almost half of our meal cost because we were SOOO pleased. He was very personable, gave us tips and offered a drink idea, the Fruity Booty which was DELICIOUS. He checked on us often, and made sure that he made us feel like we were the only people in the restaurant. We even had a few laughs with him.   Who knew our own hotel's restaurant would be so good. We went back for breakfast this morning as we left for our flight back home, and once again, EXCELLENT service!",

There were only 5 tables in use. There were 3 bus boys cleaning off tables. Oh wait! Make that two bus boys and one server cleaning off tables. We waited and waited and waited. After 15 minutes nobody came to even offer us water or something to drink. Really annoyed we got up and left. The hostess looked up surprised to see us leave and asked us what was wrong.

Food:  I had a burger, which was fine; there's only so many ways to screw up a burger, after all.  My wife ordered an advertised special, which was steak and crab legs.  She told me they were the best crab legs she'd ever had, and they certainly appeared fresh and well-prepared; I've never seen anyone have such an easy time getting huge hunks of crab meat out of the shell, especially with snow crab.  So, based purely on those crab legs, they'd get a positive review.  Service:  Here's where things fell apart.  Our server was apparently the slowest in the restaurant, which was not at all busy (we'd arrived just after 5, which is really early for dinner in Vegas).  We didn't get out of there until 6:45.  People who arrived after us got their drinks and meals before us, paid, and left before we even finished our meals.  It took him 25 minutes from the time we ordered it to bring dessert!  I mean, it's not like they had to bake the cheesecake or anything!  We really had to hustle to make it to our show, even though we felt we'd allowed plenty of time before we stopped for dinner.  Of course, when it came time to pay the check, he miraculously turned into Mr. Speedy.  So, three stars:  good food, slow service.",

The manager, Kelsey, was also very accommodating as she honored my order even though I made a huge mistake in the time it was being offered (their rib eye steak dinner).    I didn't stay at NYNY this trip but I will definitely stay there next time I visit Vegas just because the staff is so amazing.  There is much to be said of a company that hires and trains their employees to go above and beyond with their customers, even when the customer is wrong.",

All of the employees were really friendly and helpful. We had an 8 yr old in our group and he loved the giant map of America. Both him and my sister ordered lemonade which came with little flag toothpicks on the lemon (so cute!) I ordered the breakfast burrito which was pretty good and super filling. We all enjoyed our meals. Chocolate chip pancakes and bagel breakfast sandwich were also really good. You MUST stop at the doughnut counter and get the croissant donut with honey. OMG its amazing.",

This place isn't bad after coming back to the hotel at 3 in the morning and craving some cheap ribeye.   The steak benedict was like a cute steak sandwich covered with strong hollandaise sauce. If you like salty, its definitely the right thing for you. But I really wanted to wipe off all the hollandaise sauce so I can just have a steak slider.   The bacon on the other hand was some of the best I've ever had. It's better to just go simple here if you're craving a quick breakfast. Save your money for the rest of the casino.",

I really liked their chicken soup and their New York breakfast was yummy. Nothing extraordinary but consistently good.   A big shoutout to Gloria and James though.

My friend and I split 2 meals, 4 cheese pizza and rueben wrap. The pizza was HORRIBLE! The worst pizza I've ever had, including frozen microwaveable pizzas and that's exactly what it was like. I could tell just by the look of it that it was not going to be good but then I took a bite. Cold, chewy spongy soft dough, the only thing fresh on the pizza was the parsley. I'm not exaggerating it was the worst meal, I'd rather have a happy meal at McDonalds! The Rueben wrap wasn't much better, rubbery fatty meat, smothered in sauce. It was bad but not as bad as the pizza. Save yourself the money and and frustration and don't eat here!",

We stumbled in to get some food in our stomachs before the ride home. The waiter wasn't too surprised with our state. Some heads on the table while others were running back and forth from the bathroom. He brought us all out some water and well as the Mt. Dew I ordered. We took some time viewing the menu and had him come back a few times. I ordered the chipotle chicken wrap, I was drunk but still trying to be healthy. My super drunk friend decided to order the fettuccine alfredo. I felt like that was a really bad decision but we boxed and she had it the next day. Apparently it was good. My wrap was pretty good but it had a lot of lettuce. Pulled some of it out.. and put some pepper in that baby boy and we were good to go. It also came with potato wedges which were awesome!! I was excited because i didn't realize they came with that. Over all it was a mediocre cafe experience and it might not even be as good if i went sober.",

I ate here a few times during my stay and nothing wowed me. In fact, I sent back one of their \"freshly made\" donuts (that are sitting out all day and not behind a case or under glass to be kept fresh) because it was probably the worst doughnut I'd ever had--dry, flavorless and just YUCK.  I ordered a fruit salad with cottage cheese for breakfast one day and it was really good--the fruit was fresh and everything tasted good. The next day I ordered the same thing and the fruit looked markedly different--wilted, definitely not as fresh and the cottage cheese tasted \"off\".  I wouldn't waste my time ordering coffee here, so I got a latte made at Il Fornaio next door. Though they take a while and the line gets long, the coffee there looked much better than the coffee shop variety here.   Rather expensive for the quality, but they do serve you a hearty portion.   I probably wouldn't have been back as many times as I was if I wasn't staying here and they serve breakfast foods all day, as opposed to Il Fornaio which stops serving breakfast at 10:30.",

Toast, sandwiches, and hamburgers available.  Food: 4/5 Food was hot and fresh. Everything was good perfectly. You can't go wrong with this standard American breakfast. Portions were good for one person, maybe even two if you aren't that hungry.   The smoothie was creamy and SO GOOD. I will definitely be ordering it again.  I attempted to order the red berry mascarpone because it sounds like gluten free heaven (GF vanilla cake, raspberry and a mascarpone mousse finished with a red berry ganache and chocolate pearls). Was sad when the server said that they discontinued this dessert a month ago and didn't replace it with another worthy gluten free option.   Service: 4/5 Server was attentive and food delivered in about 15 minutes.   Location: 4/5 In the New York New York Hotel, the restaurant is in a decent location and easy to find.   Ambiance: 4/5 Comfortable booth seating available. I love the large topographic map of the United States that they have in the dining room. I've never seen anything like that. Very unique.

There are symbols in each state that identify what they are known for! This is as good as it gets and will be back every time I visit Vegas. Highly recommend for the great food and atmosphere!",

We came here for breakfast on our last day in town and as many times as I have stayed at the NY-NY, we had never eaten here.  I'm not quite sure why!  We ordered the breakfast dish that came with the eggs, bacon or sausage, pancakes, hash browns and that cute little chocolate chip muffin. Goodness gracious!  It was enough food to feed 2.  So, when my daughter and son dropped in with their spouses, I thought, wow this is going to be an issue!  NO, our waiter was on POINT.  He took their orders right away, brought them their drinks and had everyone satisfied in minutes.   Our food was hot and tasty.  Service was great.  I will definitely be coming back next time I'm in town.",

This spot is in the New York New York casino which to me is a great vibe to party and have some great food. This place is one of their average American food  restaurants. One sign of the quality was it was early morning on a Tuesday and their was not many people in there. Service was average and the food was overall average. The only bright spot was it is one of the few 24 hours spots on the strip and they have a rib eye and eggs special early morning. Unfortunately I didn't have the rib eye special.",

At check in they promoted their restaurant for breakfast, so we decided to try it. We went down at 11:10am and we stood at the front waiting to be seated. The restaurant has a cute decor but one thing that bothered me was that the US territories like Puerto Rico were not represented. So we sat down and we waited for our waiter at least 13-15 minutes for him to even pass by. He took our drink order, I ordered coffee and my girl ordered water. One good thing he did offer me water as well, which I think shows that he had potential of being an amazing waiter. So he came back and gave me my coffee (which was mediocre) and my girls water, and he took our order. She ordered the California Eggs Benedict and I ordered the Farm Fresh Eggs Benedict. We waited forever for the food to arrive, literally. I think we waited 20 minutes & the place wasn't that packed. Worst hash browns I have ever had, flavorless. The poached eggs in both of our meals were overlooked & my biscuit was hard as a rock. It was just bad disgusting food. We went to the pool after walking the strip so we decided to have a light lunch. We ordered a hummus platter and the Cobb Salad. Man , they brought out the food in the America Restaurant bag...we were disappointed. The hummus ratio to the pita, celery, and carrots for paying so much money was ridiculous. (SEE ATTACHED PHOTO) The Cobb Salad was mediocre, nothing special. I don't comprehend how this place has even good reviews.",

The price was on point  and the servings were big portions. This is one of the few places that serve amazing crispy shoe string fries! Added touch was that each table get their own coffee pot.

The bar is open seating so I found a spot and was immediately attended by the bartender. She was very nice and quick. I ordered coffee and the American Breakfast that consists of 2-eggs any way you want them, hash brown, bacon or sausage and pancakes. They also throw in a mini muffin. The portions are HUGE! I was only able to eat 1/2 of one pancake, and 1/2 of everything else. I had a cup of coffee and the bartender offered me another cup to go, which I absolutely accepted. Oh and they have French vanilla creamer, so you just need to ask for it. Everything was so good though that I decided to come back the next day and this time I got the NY State of Mind, which is the American Breakfast but with toast instead of the pancakes and an extra slice of bacon. Service was phenomenal! I wish I would have gotten the bartenders name, she served me both mornings, because she was friendly, quick, and very attentive. I am looking forward to my next business stay in Vegas just to wake up for breakfast. Before I forget - they have donuts  so do not leave without taking one with you because they are soft and delicious! They are pretty big so I think 2 people can share one.",

    "text": "Although T-Mobile Arena and Park MGM have certainly rejuvenated the south end of Las Vegas Boulevard New York New York remains devoid of destination dining, but for those in the area a little discussed fact is that the 24/7 America Restaurant has been offering some of Sin City's best Donuts since 2013.   Situated just off the gaming floor, and in close proximity to Self-Parking, it is at a distance that visitors will notice overhead signs in Red, White and Blue, the facade giving those who step inside an expectation of traditional American Diner staples though for those who crave fried Dough it is from counter-service to the right that the objects of their desire are available.  Featuring both Cake and Yeast plus Filled and Fancy options, the cost of seven for $12 and fifteen for $24 a veritable bargain in comparison to the likes of District for quality far better than Dunkin, it is after perusing approximately two-dozen styles that selections are carefully boxed, early arrival predictably offering the widest range, although staff reports stock is replaced fresh throughout the day as needed.  Enjoyed elsewhere, and also available with table service inside America, it was by way of a Long John topped a la Black & White Cookie that tasting began, a Brioche base fried golden and fluffy beneath Frosting that cracks to the tooth while the ubiquitous Maple Bacon Bar instead tends smoother with a good amount of crispy Pork to help offset topping that is more thinly applied than most but still quite sweet.   Further impressing with Cake, the small-ish round moist but not heavy beneath plenty of toasted Coconut, guests fond of simple Raised and Glazed will be happy to know America's fares well without being greasy, a follow-up Cherry Pie Bismark unfortunately less  enjoyable as a result of runny artificial Filling made even more cloying by a dusting of Powdered Sugar.  Back on track with Rocky Road, two types of Chocolate Chips plus chopped Nuts and Caramel served atop a hefty pocket full of Vanilla Pudding, it was much like last time that New York New York's Croissant Donut stood out against the pack, an impressive degree of separation developed between laminated layers that offered a stark textural contrast to crumbled Butterfinger held in place by Chocolate Icing.",

Of course, it's Las Vegas, where everything is a bit pricier. This just seemed to be way overpriced to me. The food was good, but nothing to warrant the prices. So, if you can get past how pricey it is, it's a good place to try out. The cronuts are good! The only other issue we had is how long it took for our food to come out. It took around 45+ minutes, but we didn't know why. It wasn't even busy at the time we were there. It's still a cool place to try, with good food.",

The quality is inconsistent. From a rock hard bagel and ice cold dinner rolls to a great, seared rib eye and wonderful crab legs, we don't know what to think. The restaurant is huge on the inside which is deceiving because of the tiny entrance.  The wait staff are nice, but rarely checked on us.  They could be short staffed. The food took forever to arrive. For the price, there are better options on the strip.",

The food was brought to our table in a timely matter, fresh & delicious taste. I strongly reccomend this restaurant, and i will for sure return everytime i return to Fabulous Las Vegas.. from now on this is a must stop for me and my family and friends.

I have no idea why I tend to crave it, especially late at night, but I really wanted toast. I chose the Empire State plate *cues Jay-Z's \"Empire State of Mind\"*, which was basically eggs in whatever style you prefer and sausage or bacon. It also came with toast, so I was content. While waiting for my order to arrive, I proceeded to strike up a conversation with the guy while updating my friends on where I was, checking Facebook/Twitter, etc. Once I looked up, homeboy was totally knocked out. And I thought I had a lot to drink that night. I gave him a good nudge once our food got to the table. A little too good. I nearly toppled over my water. Oy! Anyway, it was a good meal, nothing extravagant. Although I gotta say the bacon was cooked perfectly. I could never cook bacon the way restaurants can for the life of me. Add a star for that.",

So we were pointed in the direction of America.   The food quality was about the same as you'd get at IHOP or Denny's, and the prices about the same. So nothing to rave or complain about. My Chicken Fried Steak and Eggs was tasty, fatty, and delicious. Our waters were constantly refilled, and the decor and environment felt relaxing enough. What really stood out was...as I am asian..I MUST have soy sauce with my over easy eggs..Get that Ketchup and Salsa away from me. Our server said it'd be no problem, and she actually went all the way to neighboring restaurant Chin Chin to get me a bowl of soy sauce. Wow above and beyond the call of duty.   The only real reason I gave this four rather than five stars, was that our server disappeared for what seemed like ten minutes before we could pay our bill. Not a deal breaker, but a nuisance nonetheless.  Anyway if you're in NYNY and want some breakfast, it's worth a shot. Not to mention if you don't care about having eggs and hashbrowns etc. They have a great deal for all you can eat pancakes at like $6 (which were fluffy and delicious). One of my buds ordered that and helped feed the entire table (our server didn't mind at all)..which was cool. ~G",

You can avoid waiting in lines, which can tend to form at certain points in the day.  America is located inside the New York New York Hotel-Casino.

My dad wanted to stay at New York New York. I ate at about 5 restaurants there. I've been checking the reviews of America and other hotel restaurants and they were pretty critical. I went here twice. The first time was a Friday noon and I got the Margarita Pizza. Even though it was Vegas, it wasn't to sure about how good it was. It was actually deep dish style instead of the brick oven style. My step-mom's friend, Ann is from New Jersey and to her it was all about the crust. She liked it. To me, it was all about the toppings like the tomato sauce or the cheese. The pizza was excellent and when my dad tried it, he was in pizza heaven. The second time I tried it was was the morning we left on Sunday. I had French Toast with cinnamon and sugar. That was good also. The bread was soft, it melted in your mouth and the cinnamon and sugar made it sweet which made all those flavors work perfectly together.",

Now I can eat me some cakes so I decided to get this. You get your first plate of two nice bigs pancakes which are really thick, but beyond dry.

We asked our server for more water and a few lemons, and he forgot both, even after we reminded him.  We had to help ourselves from the lemons at the bar- LAME.  Then he made some comment like, \"I could have brought those to your table, you know,\" full of attitude.    When we finally got our bills (he also had major 'tude with giving us individual tabs), he had given us all of our change in quarters.  Some of us had more change than necessary and some of us were short-changed.  NONE of us had the correct change.  At this point I lost it and proceeded to go pretty much ape sh*t on our 45 year old server with a comb-over.  \"Excuse me, look- all of our change is completely um, how do i say this, NOT RIGHT. AT ALL.\"  He gives me a blank stare and then shrugs it off: \"Sorry, we don't have any other coins except quarters here.  We give change in quarters.\" Then he smiles sweetly and says, \"Would you like to speak to the manager, miss?\"  the rest is pretty ugly from there.  Now, let me clear that i am not expecting the world's greatest meal OR service from America the restaurant inside a Vegas casino.  However, I do expect to get what i pay for and that includes getting the correct change back, NOT IN JUST QUARTERS.   As far as this restaurant goes, it's America the Shitty, and I would rather just roll to any other hotel's 24/7 cafe to eat.  They all have one.  The club sandwich was good though...Meh.",

When I arrived at America I was seated quickly and brought water and coffee quickly, which in Vegas is a great way to start any meal.  Big old carafe of weak coffee is plopped down on your table within a minute of sitting down, and although it isn't the finest quality it makes up for it in quantity.  They have this giant tilted sculpted map of America that hangs precariously over your head as you eat.  I was seated under Texas and this did not make me happy, but examining the map/art thing was a great way to pass the time until my food arrived.  The service was quick and prompt, although the waiter forgot my smoothie on the first trip but realized it himself and was back super quick with it.  My breakfast plater thing had a good amount of mediocre food, that looked like it had actual veggies in it.  Weird.  Also the bacon had some sort of thickness (it was NOT thick bacon), but when you compare it to the bacon at a Denny's it was pretty divine.  I am pretty sure they had some kind of all you can eat buttermilk pancakes for a pretty good price as a special, but a lot of basic pancakes just didn't special to me.  I overheard that this is the food that they serve as room service in New York New York, so hopefully that helps. Things I like : Decor, Lots of coffee, bacon, hash browns, service Things I dislike: Smoothie (tasted watered down and also pricey) in the end these 24 hour places with decent prices are how I usually survive in Vegas for at least part of my time there, and I would return to America when I am dangerously close to extinction.",

One thing in general about Vegas is that dining in large groups just screws everything up and I really feel that the service since they add gratuity automatically they feel they can just shut down quality service automatically. It took at least 20 minutes to get a seat on a fairly slow 11 am on a Monday. When we were finally seated we waited another 30 just to get our orders in. I understand that restaurants want to get the food out all at once. But, I really feel that if the food is done they should starting bringing it out. My whole crew ordered breakfast except me who ordered a club sandwich. The food no joke took almost an hour to come out and mine must of been finished first because the fries were ice cold and sandwich was soggy all the way through the bread. When it was time to pay we were not allowed to split up the check any less than 2 ways. The whole fiasco took over 2 hours and wasted a good chunk of the day for a group of my friends that were leaving that day. Never again and stay away.",

During my recent trip to Vegas, I was appalled to find that the only 24 hr dining options at Excalibur (where I was staying) and Luxor were McDonald's and Krispy Kreme. My wife and I were in search of late late night/early morning dining that was more substantial that doughnuts or a gut-bomb burger. We were perplexed and nearly gave up when we literally stumbled upon America. The food was average... nothing special. Large breakfast menu, some hot sandwiches and burger, and a small dinner menu (maybe they had more, but I may not have been given the \"dinner\" menu). Our waiter was awesome. He struck me as a little.... slow, but he was an amazing human being and a fantastic waiter! Our food took a little longer than I would expect for 0400, but beggars can't be choosers. I ordered a bacon cheeseburger with fries and my wife ordered The Empire State Plate (two eggs, sausage or bacon, hash browns, and toast). Sarah LOVED her meal... she thought the hash browns were amazing and so were the eggs. My burger was rather unremarkable, but I don't consider that a bad thing. The restaurant is great for that late night meal that you crave after hours of sitting at the casino tables and our waiter was amazing and got a big tip. Three stars for being open late night, but couldn't quite bring myself to give 4 because the food took a while to come out and I would compare it to Denny's quality.",

I must say the prices were pretty good for Vegas too. They have a really cool large map sculpture of the United States on the ceiling. I had the Empire State Plate which is a breakfast plate with two eggs, hashbrowns, sausage, and toast. Everything was cooked just right. It was really good!!! My husband got a hamburger that he felt was just average. We had a great waiter who was kind and he always made sure we had what we needed. The only things that was slightly annoying was that the place was pretty dead and it took forever to get our food! I don't know what the hold up was considering there as not alot of other people in the restaurant. That is why I am deducting a star. Other than that is was a great place for late night eats with good competitive prices. I will go back.",

Other than that, I regret having ever ate at this place. Sure the big map of America is nice to look at, but out of the four of us only my boyfriend's mother liked her food...and she got mac & cheese which is hard to mess up. It took about 45 minutes for our food to come out and when it did it was luke warm. I got the buffalo chicken sandwich and it was gross and dry. I asked for more buffalo sauce and they brought me out a bowl of tasteless sauce that had been watered down one too many times. I definitely learned from my mistake and will not be returning here by choice.",

Luckily, it is literally right next to the check in desk, so we didn't have to stray too far.  We were drawn in by their fabulous display of donuts and desserts. After seeing that a no frills cake donut was $2.50, I decided against just dessert. The place was pretty dead at 3pm. There's a huge 3D map of the US with different landmarks, which I thought was pretty cool to look at.  I was definitely hungry so I ordered some spicy wings. The wings were a little too bready for me and they had a weird after taste. Not great.  The husband ordered the brownie sundae which was ginormous! 'Murica! The vanilla ice cream tasted like some generic drug store brand, which was off putting. You know how sometimes you don't eat ice cream out of the carton for a long time and there's that thick chewy bit at the top? That's what it tasted like. Besides that, the brownie tasted moist without being mushy.   The server at the bar was super nice and friendly.   FYI...there aren't any restrooms inside the restaurant, so you'll have to take a short walk in the casino to do your business.",

Not too snooty but not at all divey.  My steak was cooked perfectly and the rest of the food was amazing for a 3:00 am meal. The decor is wonderful and keeps the eyes entertained during the entire visit. The doughnut bar is wonderful and has excellent selections. They stay open 24 hours but the food taste much better than any 24 hour place I've been. Not to mention that in Vegas 24 hour spots are required knowledge. I've been twice and in both experiences the waitresses were excellent and patient.  Bonus:This cafe serves alcohol!  THE BAD: American food can be found a little cheaper elsewhere.  It's in a Hotel Casino and that may not suit all families. This also means you can't park out front so you'll have to walk from the hotel parking structure waaaay out back. They allow smoking indoors in Las Vegas. (I guess for some that could be good or bad).  ALL IN ALL:  I rated this place with 5 stars because to me it is the ultimate cafe in Vegas. It is above cafe scale in its entirety including the 24 hour service, on strip location, great hotel, great service, and great tasting food. I consider it a MUST for the Vegas traveler.",

It also felt a bit dry in the mouth.  I read that the Bavarian cream donuts were yummy on yelp so I was ready to get that.   Once I was there I saw several cream filled LOOKING donuts and asked the cashier how they were all different. She gave me a HORRIBLE answer. \"Umm, They're pretty much all the same.\" Me: \"So what's the difference between the donut labeled 'Bavarian Cream' and the one with the dollop of cream on top?\" Cashier \"That they  look different.\" I tried to laugh a little to ease the awkward rudeness and got the cute and supposedly cream filled donut. *insert annoying buzzer sound here* It wasn't filled! It was just the little dollop on top!   Though the cream was delicious (as I read on yelp), the DOUGH of the DOUGHnut was dry as heck! I was very disappointed.

Even so, all of our servers were very friendly and attentive.  We had the following dishes:  Humongous Pretzel - This pretzel really is humongous. It could serve 2-3 people and came with French's Mustard and Cheddar Cheese Sauce. It was what you would expect any soft pretzel to be: soft and chewy and delicious.    Petite Caesar Salad - While it maybe \"petite\" it really was a generous serving. The house made croutons were huge (and my toddler loved chewing on them), and it was pretty tasty.  ABC Omelet and the Ham & Cheese Omelet - Pretty good. Generous amount of avocado on the ABC omelet, and lots of ham in the Ham & Cheese omelet. I thought it was interesting that the cheese wasn't inside the omelet, but rather melted on top. Both came with hash browns and choice of toast, and a delicious mini muffin.  Steak and Eggs - Steak was a bit under cooked, but the rest was good.   Corned Beef Hash & Eggs - A little greasy and kind of a small portion,but good nonetheless.   America is careful to prevent cross contamination if you have a gluten intolerance, which we really appreciated. They have several options that are GF and took the time to make sure everything came out as it should. The prices here were pretty decent, too.  They also have good coffee, which was a nice break from Starbucks.   We'd eat here again if we were in the area!",

    "text": "I don't know what happened to this place over the years but it was quite a disappointment coming back here recently and seeing the change.   Do not come here unless you are desperate because everything else has closed within the hotel and you are too tired to go walking down the strip, like me! Also, don't come here unless you have at least an hour to waste while you are waiting with hunger pangs for your food.   I came two times during my last trip because I had booked a stay within NY NY which happens to be my favorite hotel in Vegas. I have always liked the food at America and service was always decent.  Both times I came recently were just terrible. The first time we waited exactly 40 minutes for our food. Our waiter seemed to make jokes over the fact that he moved verrrrrrrrrrrrrry slooooowwww. Well he wasn't joking. It ended up being True. It was not busy as this was around 2am.   Another time we decided to try again for breakfast, hoping the first disaster was just a fluke. The waitress was not very friendly and she never came around. She didn't even serve us our food or give us refills. We had several other people come around to do her job. The thing is, she wasn't even busy. She only had two tables. The place was dead. There is no excuse for terrible service like this.  Also, there was a very obnoxious drunk girl yelling at the bar for the entire time we had to wait for our food to arrive. At first this all seemed slightly amusing, I mean it IS Vegas. However, after awhile it was annoying and none of the staff seemed to give a darn about her behavior. No one told her to pipe down. She just sat there putting on a drunken show for the entire place, cussing and showing undies and falling off the bar stool. I guess this is what keeps the staff awake at 2am. Who knows.   The food has also decreased in taste and quality. Too bad. I used to really look forward to this place back in the day for some great steak and eggs at 3am. Never again.",

Did a search on the restaurants in NYNY and found that America was the only non bar open at that time (1 am).  Menu looked decent, certainly appeared to be better than McDonalds.  Hostess was nice, we were seated right away.  Waiter comes and takes our order, and then we wait.  And wait.  And wait.  45 minutes passes, no food, and I haven't seen our waiter in at least 25 min.  I flag down the hostess, who says she will find out what is going on.  About 3 min later I see our waiter saunter in from out of the restaurant.  He goes to the back, and surprise surprise, our food is ready!  I had ordered a burger, my wife the night's special, a sirloin steak, medium well.  The steak was burned to a crisp, definitely medium well.  My burger, while it did not appear burnt, tasted burnt.  The bun was soggy as well.  Not what we expected after waiting 45 min.  We contacted the manager who was very apologetic, and offered to get us some cold sandwiches from the menu.  We declined and he did not ask us to pay for the meals.  He said that he would be talking to the cook about it.  We will not be going into this restaurant on our next Vegas trip.  Seriously, you are better off going to Denny's or McDonalds if you are hungry late at night.",

Great piece of art and worth coming just to see it.   We ordered...  Coffee  Orange juice  Eggs Benedict  Crab Cake Benedict   My Crab Cake Benedict was good and bad. Let me explain...  The Crab Cake was yummy but the egg was not runny. It was like a hard boiled egg (which I hate). The tomato hallondaise sauce was yummy.   Our waiter Claudio was very nice and professional. Rest of the staff were equally pleasant.   Overall not a bad experience but I doubt I'll be back.",

The decor wasn't bad for the holiday season. They  had some 2013 hats and headbands and trumpets. Overall the food was ok.  We got their special prime rib which was pretty good. The southern fried chicken was not good, it was dry and hard to eat.   Service was decent but not over the top. Food definitely was slow to come.   It's a decent place to eat when you have nowhere to go and you're staying at NYNY. I'ts definitely not a restaurant to visit on purpose.",

    "text": "This restaurant is ok. My husband and I stopped in here for dinner before heading to a show. I ordered the macaroni and cheese and was disappointed, ultimately it tasted like Velveeta shells and cheese but the shells were a bit larger. Now don't get me wrong Velveeta shells and cheese is great but I can buy that at my local grocery store for $1.50 where as this plate cost $10.95. I suppose I just expected a little more out of it. My husband ordered the slider trio (which was a fish taco, pulled pork on a biscuit and a beef slider) which he wasn't blown away by either.  PROS: Their decor is cute, they have a giant map of America on the wall that highlights each state with something they are known for, example: Michigan had cars for the motor city.   CONS: There were maybe a dozen people in this restaurant when we went (which didn't even fill a quarter of the tables) yet we had to wait about 10 minutes to be seated. The hostess seemed frazzled so I can't imagine what it would be like if they were actually busy.  TIPS: This city is filled with amazing restaurants, this restaurant is fine, but I personally would not go out of my way to eat here again :/",

America is one of the few places serving it and I'm glad we decided to try it there. The Cronut itself was great, but also the bagel was absolutely tasty. Service was polite and friendly and very attentive.

The coffee is terrible & the food is outrageously over-priced - although, it is a casino restaurant so I shouldn't expect better. I ordered french toast (which was almost $10, just for two slices of french toast - no eggs, no bacon, no other food included) and it was absolutely terrible.  It was basically bread smothered in cinnamon.  If this meal wasn't being comped by the casino, I would have been very upset.    The only upside about this restaurant is the service.  Our waitress was very nice & she is the only reason this place is getting two stars.  The price just isn't worth it.  We ended up paying $30 for two to eat breakfast (which was part of a $50 meal voucher we received from the casino for staying in the hotel) and then had to eat again afterwards because the food was so terrible.

Omelet arrived, looked like a normal omelet Eggs Benedict - hmm, hollandaise sauce was topped over the egg, but why did it not drizzle even a little down the egg? And what's this black stuff on the muffin, wait, they burned the muffin?! Can't be too bad since only ONE side was burnt. OK, I have this rule of taking back food, I TRY NOT to. I took one bite and seriously, all I tasted was the burnt of the toast. OK, take 2, can I get this fixed?   Take 2- Manager comes out to apologize for the order. OK, muffin not burnt, but only a the tips of the crust seem to be a little charred. Bite- why is this muffin not toasted? hollandaise sauce was thick and gewey, tasted a bit mushy. Egg was a bit overcooked and hash browns were mushy on the outside. No amount of Ketchup could save them. Only hate 1/2 of one muffin.  BF said his omelet was OK, but I guess his stomach didn't give the same reaction and suffered for 2 days after.  Service was sub par. At least my meal was  comped.",

We walked into the restaurant and the host was very gracious and genuine inquiring how our trip was. She was so grandmotherly!  I ordered the ABC OMELET which consisted of Fresh Avocado, Bacon and Wisconsin Cheddar and I ordered a side of bacon. When my entree arrived I was surprised to discover that the avocado was simply sliced up and garnished on top my omelette. My side bacon was not that great though. I specifically asked the waitress if the bacon was good there and she assured me that she would make sure it was cooked properly and it would crunchy. My bacon came out somewhat burnt and chewy. Overall, my omelette was satisfying and the grandmotherly hostess was the highlight.",

I ordered the pot roast dinner which consisted of mashed potatoes, onions, carrots, and roasted potatoes -smothered in gravy. Strangely enough, there was one thing missing-POT ROAST. In this bowl of slop, I did detect one piece of something that resembled meat..... I think.   My daughter and aunt ordered the brick oven pizza  The pizza was not bad---and is the only reason I didn't give this place one star.  My youngest daughter ordered the spaghetti and meatballs off of the kids menu. The sauce wasn't anything special- but the meatball was decent.

Prices look decent, especially since America is inside a casino.  We arrived around 7:30 AM and there wasn't much of a line.  So, I'm sure we'll be back one day for some real food.   As for my review...it's all about their donuts. I tried their maple bar with chocolate drizzle and some of their cronuts.  The maple bar wasn't as good as it looks.  The donut wasn't fresh, it was lacking any flavor, and for about $3, way to expensive.  However, I think America's has some of best cronuts that I've had in Las Vegas. I have my favorite out there, but America had a unique taste to their's.  Their cronuts were layered with the outside of each layer having a crunchiness to them.  It was moist inside each layer and as you get closer to the center of this hybrid donut, it's even softer.  There's a uniquie citrus taste to these cronuts which appeals to me.  America may have bad maple bars, but sure made a huge comeback with delicious cronuts.   PS:  Additional photos of America's cronuts can be found here.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/donut-crawl-ii-las-vegas?select=IWJfpUAAiQK3e4zSSwB2Wg#IWJfpUAAiQK3e4zSSwB2Wg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/donu...</a>  YELP PERSONAL CHALLENGE - (057/366)",

She was quick with the coffee and to accommodate my requests. The burrito was okay, but definitely needed the salsa. The hashbrowns were flavorless and bland, and kinda slimy under the crust. Would not recommend them at all.",

The steaks were tasty but just a bit over cooked (we asked for medium rare and got medium, which was fine). 4/5 stars.   The morning after we got coffee and donuts. 5/5... Cinnamon sugar cronut was heavenly. Boston cream donut, delicious.   Service was slower that I would have liked, but not terrible. 4/5 stars.  Gigantic America on the ceiling was fun to look at.  We spent awhile discussing what it was made of. Styrofoam? Concrete? Paper mache?  Overall pretty good. I would go back after a night of heavy drinking for breakfast steak and eggs!",

Miss Rocio kept rushing us to order our meals. While we were ordering my relatives changed their minds on a food item and she flat out left! It's extremely rude for a waitress to do that. Then, when we decided to cancel one of our meal she rolled her eyes at us and gave us a glare. That's right she ROLLED HER EYES. She literally made my entire family feel unwanted at this establishment. DO NOT RECOMMEND HER AS A WAITRESS. Next time, if I were to eat here, I would never want her as my waitress again. Throughout the meal, she refused to check up on us and only checked on the tables surrounding us, once again making us feel unwanted. I felt like she was being discriminatory toward us. :/ On the bright side, the food was pretty good. It's literally only reason I would come back. Overall, bad service, but good food.

The first experience started off with saying they could only split up 4 different checks? We had 40 people with 13 different families? But oh well we decided to figure it out..the key here this place was dead as a door nail and not making an exception to this was totally ridiculous.   Well we decided to jump into the ordering process which was another nightmare...which again for a totally dead restaurant why would you leave 1 waiter to help out such a huge party leaves a big question on who is managing this place? I can't put all the blame on our server because he really was trying to hustle his butt off but I think the lack of sheer disorganization lead to the ultimate melt down.  Here we go food not coming out with everyone else's food...cold food...my wife's food never got ordered...mix ups with food...the mediocre food at best...then ultimate melt down; paying the bill. This literally took 30+ mins to get figured all because they couldn't put families groups together. In my opinion they brought this pain upon themselves and probably the reason why this restaurant had no customers in it...this was a once and done for me based on customer service, selection , and quality all the way around.",

    "text": "This is a solid 24 hour casino coffee shop type place in NYNY, but it's not overwhelming.  I had breakfast one morning at the cafe, and service was very quick.  I ordered the bagel sandwich, which has eggs, bacon, ham, and cheddar cheese.  It comes with hash browns.  The only hot sauce America has is red Tabasco, which I don't care for by itself.  So, the waiter asked if I would like to try their salsa.  I said I would.  The salsa wasn't bad, it actually had a little spice.  It's thin, so it was hard to get on the sandwich, I basically had to dip.  I was annoyed when the bill arrived and I had a $1.50 charge for the salsa.  It's not that I care about paying $1.50, but he offered like he was doing me a favor and didn't mention it was an additional charge.  I would have still said yes, but I feel like you should give diners a heads up when there is a charge that's not on the menu directly in front of them.  The sandwich was large and did not stay together well.  The bagel was grilled, but not toasted.  I would have preferred it toasted for a more consistent result.  The shaved ham overwhelmed the sandwich, which is too bad because the bites I did get with bacon were very good.  The hash browns had a decent sear to them, they clearly were cooked well.    It's not fantastic, but a decent value if you are in need of a quick and casual meal.  Also, the map of the USA around the restaurant is pretty cool.",

Waiters and waitresses should at the very least be aware of the menu!!!!! I know not to expect a lot when dining out but this place was a joke. They even tried to argue with us about the amount of time it took to get our food. We had proof! The waiter continued to ignore us and avoided eye contact until we begged for the bill.

Not really too much to look at - typical diner-style restaurant with a lot of American maps and ethos painted on the walls. We came in pretty late when it was empty, so we just slipped onto a couple of the bar stools at the front. The beer selection is pretty standard, but not expensive, and the liquor selection is quite extensive. I ordered your standard breakfast - eggs, bacons, toast, etc. - as a late-night snack, and it came out pretty much as you'd expect. In all - a decent place to grab a bite within NY-NY, but nothing more than that.",

    "text": "This place is OK. It was 1:00 AM on a Saturday night and we had just had a couple beers at Nine Fine Irishmen and wanted some food. We asked the concierge which restaurants were open this late inside the casino and she said America is open 24 hours and \"it's like Denny's, but better.\"  Not sure about the better part but it's definitely like Denny's. Just your basic greasy diner that serves breakfast, lunch, and dinner all day long. I was craving breakfast foods so I got the eggs, sausage, hash browns, and toast. Honestly it wasn't the greatest but it was good and it satisfied my hunger. My friends also ordered the french toast, turkey burger, and BLT and everyone thought their food wasn't bad. Service was OK, nothing to complain about. The prices are a little high but typical for a casino/hotel like New York New York. I guess the best part is that it's open 24 hours so if you don't want to leave the building, you can always eat here.",

Part of the fun was going to America, a restaurant in the New York New York Hotel and Casino. It is in a quiet location, away from all the noise of the casino and the more boisterous tourists. The service was very friendly, and the meal was great. We shared crab legs and steak, and we both walked away happy. And, the 3D map on the ceiling of the United States made for interesting conversation the whole time, too.",

    "text": "What's with all the low ratings? I must have been to a different America restaurant because I certainly thought that the service and food was good.  Came here on a weeknight around 12AM with a fairly large group (13 people). We were seated fairly quickly after a 10-minute wait. This place is huge and it was fairly empty at this time. The map of the US hanging from the ceiling is a nice touch and very educational.  Almost everyone in our group got the $12 rib-eye steak midnight special. My steak was delicious! and cooked to my liking. Although I had asked for my steak to be cooked medium, my gf noted that it wasn't medium and that it was missing the little plastic thing they stick on the meat to show how well it was cooked.  Medium or not, I still enjoyed it. Must be my hunger taking over. I've also never heard of HP brand steak sauce until I came here. I usually pour A1 on my steak but after trying the HP sauce, I'm a convert! It had more zing and brought out the taste of the steak to the fullest.  We had a lava cake for dessert but I didn't like the ice cream that came with it. Toffee/coffee flavored. I prefer chocolate or vanilla next to my lava cake.  My only complaint was that I had ordered my steak with mash potatoes but instead it came with baked potato. I liked the baked potato enough so I didn't bother to have it exchanged. Also, I had to flag down the waiter a few times to remind him to bring/refill my gf's iced tea. He keeps on forgetting. I guess I can't blame him for serving a huge group on a graveyard shift.  Other than that, I believe America is an ok place. It's not a fine dining establishment but I am somewhat surprised with all the one-two star ratings.  I must be missing something.",

    "text": "We stayed at the New York-New York this last weekend for 2 nights.   Both nights we ended up seeking refuge at the America Diner at some ungodly hour, much like old travelers of yore would seek refuge at a Tavern to escape the icy snowstorm howling outside.   Except in our case it wasn't howling but it was the incessant sound of clinging coins, and it wasn't a snowstorm but utter mayhem on the Casino floor.   Lastly, it wasn't icy but it was an inconceivable amount of cheap booze that would leave us clutching ourselves in agony the next morning.  While the food pretty much sucked at America, I'm still pretty fucking glad the place was still open at 3 AM on Sunday morning.  While my wife ordered the steak the first night, she opted for the pancakes the second night.   I went with the Macaroni & Cheese and a Spicy Chicken Sandwich the first night and the Macaroni & Cheese and Potato Skins the second night.    (Hey! Nothing like simple carbs to absorb an insane amount of alcohol lounging about in your stomach)  The first night, the Mac & Cheese tasted very much like I what I imagine a Salt Lick tastes like.   The Spicy Chicken Sandwich was anything but.  I'm guessing they ran out of Buffalo sauce and they figured I was too drunk to give a fuck.   While it's True I was too drunk to start an argument then & there, I knew I'd get these fuckers on Yelp sooner or later.    The Mac & Cheese the 2nd night was legit... not great but certainly better than the first night since I could actually glimpse the taste of cheese that time around.   My wife said the steak was completely fucked up and she's still having painful bowel movements some 48 hours later.   The pancakes were good, but then again how does one really fuck up pancakes now, right?  If this was the Bay Area, I'd probably give this place 1 star or 2 at the very most.   Seeing as they're open 24 hours a day though, I'm being generous and giving them 3 stars.   Besides, as drunk as we were, it's fascinating to realize that you're the most composed couple at 3 AM in here.   I feel bad for the waiters and waitresses here... They gotta deal with some seriously fucked up shit every day.",

The decor of this place is amazing.  There's a huge 3D map of the United States showing each state's claims to fame.  You really just need to see it.  Our server was knowledgable and attentive without being overbearing.    My parents own a small breakfast restaurant and I worked there until after I graduated college so I am a huge breakfast snob.  I mean, it takes A LOT for me to compliment a breakfast made in a restaurant, and let me tell you: that breakfast was GOOD. I ordered the eggs benedict which came with hash browns and a halved roasted tomato.  I don't even like tomatoes usually but that one tasted really good.  I don't think the hash browns were home made, which would be the only downside.  The coffee was really good.",

I think foreign visitors and families with children might get a bit more out of the decor and USA trivia on the menu, but the place is designed to be a diner and as such, it fits the bill just fine. The breakfast menu is ordinary (eggs, pancakes, etc), but executed just fine. The service was friendly and efficient. The prices were decent.   In short, good place to get a quick bite, but nothing for a foodie to drool over.",

    "text": "I have come to accept all 24-hour establishments at casinos as overpriced horrible places. Recently I had this experience at Purple Parrot in Atlantis Reno. America has changed my position, and now I find these places have a chance of dishing out solid food. Although, because of the 24-hour time frame drunks frequent this place, and I can only imagine what the staff must go through (I hate dealing with drunks).   I visited America Restaurant with friends on Monday May 9 and 10, 2011. My friends suggested we catch a late breakfast here as they had enjoyed it the last time they came. We didn't encounter any lines or wait times as is common with midweek stays to Las Vegas. Our seating host was courteous and welcomed us to change our table for a booth. The first thing I noticed, when I entered, was the huge curved topographic map of USA with exaggerated details characteristic of each state. We visited early afternoon and late morning. Our server was Melanie for both visits, a sweet, attentive and knowledgeable lady. Don't let her small stature fool yah! She makes an awesome server to have at your local restaurant. She gave us suggestions for how locals do Las Vegas!   I had the Reuben sandwich with onion rings and the Irish Red beer along with the potato skins. Irish Red beer is nicely paired with really rich food and cuts through some of the fattiness. The potato skins were some of the best I've had. They came out soft and moist with a nice chewy skin on the bottom; they are served with a sprinkle of tomato and a stack of these phenomenal shoe-string style fried onions. The Reuben sandwich on marbled rye bread was buttery and had a nice crunch with a lovely melding of corned beef, sauce and sauerkraut in the center; paired nicely with sweet fried onion rings.   The second visit called for a breakfast entree. I ordered the eggs benedict. It was descent. Two English muffin bottoms topped with a slice of ham, poached egg and hollandaise. It's a standard construction of eggs benedict. I enjoyed the addition of baby water crest greens on top. It's served with awesome BROWNED hash browns. I would suggest the chef to butter the muffin and add some paprika or chili powder to the hollandaise. I was surprised when I cut into the poached egg. I hit a water pocket and it came running out. The eggs weren't runny, which is fine because they came out how I like them--soft and not dry and powdery.   I'll definitely return and check up on the place. Thanks to all the hard working staff that made our visit unique and memorable. Also thanks for the food and travel suggestions, and the sharing of conversations and stories. We felt very welcomed like family!",

It wasn't too far from our hotel,Excalibur.  The only problem I had was with the host. They didn't seem approachable and I felt as if we ruined their day when we walked in.. So that was my only downfall for this place...   Food was so good! Lots and Lots of comfort food! I love the macaroni and cheese! Their chicken fried steak was good but nothing out of the ordinary.

The wife and I were fairly worn out, very hungry and just wanted a quick bite before heading to our hotel to collapse.  Our friendly server made a few suggestions from the menu, none of them appealed to either of us. We each just wanted something simple, we weren't looking for or expecting a fine dining experience. A nice, juicy hamburger with fries would do the trick.  The orders came out promptly and looked delicious. The fries were hot and crispy but something was definitely not right with the hamburgers. The texture was odd, they had no flavor and after peeling back the bun, no grill marks to show they had ever touched a grill or flat top. I'm 99% certain they were precooked, (maybe even purchased frozen and pre cooked?) then heated in a microwave. The bun LOOKED great but, while not stale, had obviously been around a day or two. We each left 2/3 of our burgers untouched. Paid the bill and left.  Possibly they had an off night, but a decent hamburger isn't hard to do is it? This was our only truly bad dining experience in Vegas during our stay. I see other reviewers have had good experiences here ordering breakfast, maybe that's your best bet.",
