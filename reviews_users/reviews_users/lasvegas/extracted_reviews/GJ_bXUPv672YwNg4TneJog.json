The concept of a Chinese/Mexican fusion should involve the unique and bold flavor that is typical of the two cultures. The flavors here were authentic, creative, and well put together and exactly what a fusion of these two cultures should be. I will definitely be returning here and encourage True food lovers to explore this wonderful place as well",

    "text": "China Poblano is an Asian/Mexican fusion restaurant that has good intentions but I think misses the mark on communicating their vision and does not get you good bang for your buck.    I went here for brunch, as the Cosmopolitan is limited on breakfast options.  The group I went with was also not very familiar with the fusion concept.  When we were looking through the menu, many of them were confused because the menu wasnt clearly communicating what was a \"traditional\" asian item, \"traditional\" mexican item & \"fusion\" item.  They also didn't have a good enough description as to what was in a taco, on a tortilla or what was a soup/ceviche on their brunch menu.  Most of my party had no idea what they ordered until it arrived.  I thought it was too expensive for what you got.  First, chips, guacamole, salsa were all extra costs.  Our salsa literally looked like a splash of salsa in the bowl.  If you're going to charge me for it, it better be a bowl of salsa.  Many of the items were about $5-$10 and you literally got (1) taco with no sides of beans or rice.  You would have to spend about $20 each to get a decent meal.  I got the chilaquiles, which are normally my favorite brunch item.  When they arrived, it was not what I qualify as a good chilaquiles.  The chips barely had any sauce on them, it was too cheesy and chorizo was just plopped down on top of it.  I basically had chili cheese nachos and was disappointed.",

    "text": "Went 2 days in a row.  First day, since it was our first visit, the server explained that there are 3 kitchens, that dishes are mainly tapas style/to be shared, and that they come out as they are finished.  No problem.  We had pork buns, the corn dish and Dan Dan noodles.  Drinks were great, food awesome.  Multiple dishes were on the table at the same time, which was fine with us.  Second visit...we ordered and first dish came out.  It was 40 min before any other dishes came out.  Meanwhile, 3 tables that came in behind us had multiple dishes and were well on the way to being finished eating.  When we pointed this out to our server, she made the excuse that the 3 kitchens try to time the food we ordered, but in the same breath, said that there is no way to control the food coming out to multiple tables, as there are 3 kitchens.  So, which is it?  She made no attempt to check on our food or apologize for the long wait, and would not respond or explain why we were told what we were told the day before.  This time, the food was just ok...we ordered tacos, chilaquilles, and a couple other dishes.  Service on drinks was very slow, also.  I ordered a beer before my tacos arrived and had finished eating them before the beer arrived.  Disappointing consistency of food and attitude.  Not interested in giving it a third shot.",

    "text": "On our recent trip to Vegas, my mother and I came here because of a rave review by some people we met on the trip. My mom wanted Chinese and I wanted Mexican, so the restaurant seemed perfect.  The prices were shocking ($5 per taco? seriously?) so we ended up sharing the chips & salsa, Mongolian beef, and 20 vegetable fried rice. The food was delicious, but the prices are outrageous. It was $32 for the beef (which was basically a glorified salad). It was a delicious strip steak, but tiny, we were expecting more. The fried rice was delicious but not worth $20. Plus, the amount of food we were given did not satisfy us. When we arrived my mother was starving, and she left unsatisfied so we ended up having a second (tiny) dinner at Serendipity 3. Next time I want Mexican in Vegas, I'll go to Yolos in Planet Hollywood.",

    "text": "Portion sizes are like tapas. Prices are like standard entrees. Tastes are nothing to remember. You're basically paying for flashy street food, but the prices are 3-4x more. I initially went to China Poblano because I heard that the tacos were insanely good. I must have misheard that conversation.  We started off with a pot of Golden Monkey tea, which was pretty good. They hand you a Perfect Tea Timer with your pot, so you can enjoy your brew just how you like it. I was impressed, so far. Then, I ordered some food.  Appetizesr: -Shu Mai Scallops (6 pcs) - Shu mai was more gooey than the usual plumpness that I expect from shu mai. It wasn't that great, especially for the $12 price. -Steamed oat noodles:  noodles were a little overcooked. Dipping sauce was average. Regretted ordering after first bite.  Food: -Pancita al Pastor (pork belly + pineapple tacos) (2 pcs) -  This was ok. Didn't blow my mind or anything. I'll take real $2 street tacos over these $9 tacos any day. -Viva China Tacos (beef tendon + oyster + scallions) -  a taco recommended by the waiter.  Again, nothing special. -Rou Jia Mo Street Sandwich - A tasty, juicy pork sandwich. By far the best tasting food on our table. You only get one per order. And, it's tiny.  Overall, the apps were mediocre. The food is puny, bland, and pricey. Ended up spending over $30 a person and we were still hungry.  We stopped ordering food after receiving plate after plate of disappointment. We ended up going to the hidden pizza shop upstairs to make up for this mediocrity. Spent $4 there and enjoyed that meal that made my stomach and wallet happy.",

I like salty food, but the chinese food here is way too salty.    Also, what's up with the names of the asian dishes?  Each dish name sounds like a Kung Fu movie...With these names, you have to sit there and read the entire description of the dish before you know what you're ordering.  For example...they had a dish called \"swallow a cloud,\" um...why can't you just call it wonton noodle or something similar to the dish so it's easier to recognize.  I understand it may \"fun\" names...but it's not run having to sit there and read every single dish.",

I was recommended this place, but was iffy about trying it because it was two very different foods in the same restaurant... I wasn't sure if I'd like it, but I gave them a chance anyways and I'm so glad I did! My friend and I absolutely loved this place!!! We sat at the bar and started with an awesome pomegranate margarita topped with salted FOAM rather then the traditional salted rim. Every dish we got we were completely satisfied with and we're looking forward to our next trip back to Vegas so that we can eat here again! I highly recommend the Tuna Ceviche, Golden pig BBQ pork buns, and the mango \"sticky rice\" dessert.  Oh, another plus- our server was super friendly and outgoing :)",

If money were no object, I would go here once a week.  But at that price, its more of a special occasion.    the Cocktails were Fabulous,  and very tasty,  as were the pre-cocktails we had at Chandelier Bar.    My Favorite dish was the Traditional Shu Mai,  the \"gold\" flecks were a nice touch.  They were moist and yummy and flavorful.   The 10 ingredient soup was a very unique blend of flavors.  good,  but next time I'll try a noodle soup.   The Guacamole was super yummy,  it had cucumber which I'll have to add to my next batch.    My other favorites were the Carnitas Taco with green sauce and chicarones, mmmm and the Tuna Ceviche with sesame.    For the barbacoa taco,  i was expecting a traditional mexican slow roasted beef,  not something with bar-b-que sauce.  Although I love nopalitos (cactus) on anything.   Next time I'll have to have the queso, and more.....Lunch anyone?",

The Chinese food was definitely better than the tacos we tried (which were good I'm from California and my standards for tacos are very high). This place is worth it for the Chinese food. The Dan Dan Mian was to die for. Our dumplings were excellent too. I would go back for the Dan Dan Mian alone!   The ambiance is good. Festive, and the decor is interesting to look at.

When in vegas and you want a decent, quick meal without spending a ton of money, I'd say this place was pretty good! One thing I did not like -1 star is that they charged me wrong! I looked at my signed receipt and the amount charged on my card and noticed a $15 difference! It's too small to even complain about but that wasn't cool...  We ordered:  Silencio taco - duck tongue, definitely interesting. The lychee flavor wasn't very strong though Pancita pastor taco - pork belly, had too much sauce Rainbow congee - not the normal items that you usually see in a congee, but still tasty to me Unruly monk noodle soup - this was way too salty Ten treasures noodle soup - yum!

For drinks, if you like a little kick/smoke to your margarita, then get the one with the \"special rim\".

Don't order the 22 dollar expensive seafood noodle dish. Not worth it. Also, the scallop shu mai was just okay. My friend and I tried 2 desserts, and neither were impressive.

Of course we had to try them and the tacos were delicious as well as the Ants Climbing a Tree noodles.   The restaurant was mostly empty on a Tuesday evening so service staff was very attentive. Also don't skip the drinks - the Salt Air Marg is definitely one of the better margaritas I've had.",

We ordered xiaolongbao, small portion but flavor was authentic. Dan Dan Mian was ok, Beijing glass noodle portion small but healthy, lots of veggie. Took forever for every dish to arrive for us, not sure why. The portion was so small we had 4 dishes and left to go across the food court, and saw other customers from China poblano there, that says something.",

I thought i was walking up to a window to order some chow mang noodles but it was just a hole in the wall with no one in there! so i went to the other side and i thought it was a window to order some tongue tacos but no one in there either! then i realized it was just 1 restaurant trying to be smart and combine 2 different kinds of foods!! Chinese and Mexican foods!! i bet its a white man with this stupid idea. I dont want no chung main tacos, carne' asaba boiled beefy bowls, carnitoe char su bows! that sounds icky wicky ticky my pinky pretty please with a pinky toe on top!! when we got inside they had old brown azn and latin people being projected on the walls! So what, we are just art pieces now? I looked around and seen all these white people looking at the projections and saying stuff like \"hey bro look at mr. miyagi over there!\" damn that sucks man, mr miyago is dead BRO. let him rest in piece in karate heaven. If he was here he would do a damn flash kick on you and your damn mama and papa and while you in the air he would jump up and stick chop sticks in ur boom boom holes and remove them swiftly and make you smell each others sticks!! so you would smell your mamas and papas bunghole sauce!! YOU LIKE THAT!?!?! i dont think so!! be respectful!! yes i realize im being very disrespectful in my yelp review but im trying to change, im going to therapy about my anger with the planet and the people who inhabit it. Im trying to do good stuff!! after i got so mad sitting there. I ordered a bean taco and meditated while i waited for my 1 bean taco. i sat and cleared my mind and i transported to this crazy place that ive never been to before!! i usually transport when i meditate but i usually go to my grandmas tranquil garden and eat a orange on the grass with her while we both float in the air sitting in lotus position. This time i transported to a weird house with a old Voltzwagon van in the driveway, i was scared but curious, i very quietly said \"hey boys, anybody home tonight?\" and i hear a old voice say \"hi!\" and slowly comes out MR MIYAGI !! im not lying to you! i dont lie, trust me! PAT MORITA come out and he tells me to calm down!! and then he tells me to start waxing his van!!! i couldnt believe it!!! i told him i dont wanna wax your damn van, that thing is old and dirty as hell!! then he gets all mad and says its part of your meditation training and i was like i dont need training i just meditated and transported into a fictional movie of the 1980s!!! he then said \"you passed the test!!\" he said only a imbecile would have started to wax that old stinky van! it was then quiet for a minute, it was completely silent, so silent that you could hear a cricket toot a poof! he took a deep deep breath and his chest filled with magic air, he then said to me \"HERE IS YOUR BEAN TACO!\" i was like what?? then i felt a slap on my shoulder and i awoke to a lady giving me my bean taco. I ate the taco and realized that it was just beans from a dang can! i paid $4 plus tax for a scoop of beans! i could have bought 4 cans of beans instead!! Even with the bad restaurant experience, i couldn't believe i had a meditative expedience like i just had. I paid, left some lucky belly button lint as a tip and walked out. as i was walking out, i noticed one of the projections was actually Mr Miyagi, i swear, the projection then moved, looked at me in the eyes, and WINKED. I then looked at the Bro who made that insensitive remark and i winked at him. he blew a kiss at me. then i was kinda caught off guard so i just waved my right hand at him like foorest gump does when hes waving at lieutenant dan on the shrimp boat. he came over and we talked about life, i got bored talking to him so i just kept saying uh huh yup thats cool man. and he kept wanting to hang out, but i was like im tired i gotta go. he was bummed but its alright he will find someone else that matches his personality. im too advanced for him. i mean i just transported into karate kid thats so crazy. ANYWAYS this place sucks.",

I ordered the 'Swallow a Cloud' noodle dish - it was like sipping on kitchen sink water. Imagine stale water with a hint of flavoring. Expecting the something along the lines of the Chinese 'Five Tastes' -  pungent, sweet, sour, bitter, and salty - it not at all what I got. Upon recommendation of the gentleman behind the bar, I ordered the quail eggs siu mai. Meh - just 'ok'. It was hard to distinguish the flavors that were in the siu mai, which were the egg, peanut, shrimp and pork. $16.88 was the price per each item I ordered. Also I ordered a water and it tasted funny. I stopped drinking it.  So wishing I had hit up a Starbucks instead.   Also, I know this is Vegas, but I really wish restaurants would make people wear some damn clothes. Boobs in my face during lunch is not appetizing for me.",

The broth had a great smokey taste which is perfect for me because I love spicy food. The restaurant also has original Cocoa Cola's in the bottle (referred to on the receipt as 'Mexican coke').   My friend had the Swallow a Cloud noodle soup, which is pretty much a wonton soup without all of the veggies (although, there was bok choy). He had plenty of broth & said it was perfect after a night of drinking.   I thought this place would have all Chinese-Mexican infused food, but found that a lot of the menu options were Standard dishes you'd find at a Chinese or Mexican restaurant. Also, the sizes were a little small for my tastes, 'tapas' style.",

    "text": "A truly unique experience. We were visiting Las Vegas for the night on the way back to New York, and were looking for something that wouldn't break the bank but that would be different than what we can get back home. Vegas is mostly full of the same restaurants as NYC and Miami (I've lived in both) so this was actually a tall task.   China Poblano came highly recommended by my boss, and I couldn't pass it up since it combines two of my favorite cuisines.   Drinks: very very good and fairly unique; I liked the salt air margarita and the mezcal negroni best, and highly recommend the $32 cocktail flight so that you can try 4 different ones. They are generous portions and the flight is perfect for sharing.  Food: everything was very good, but my favorites were the 20 vegetable fried rice, and the carnitas taco (great verde sauce). I want to go back to try everything -- so many options and everything on the menu looked amazing.  Service: excellent! The waiter was super knowledgeable and helpful in guiding us through the menu, and everything was very prompt...which was great since we had a flight to catch!  Atmosphere: a very cool vibe. I wouldn't call this place super family friendly, but it's the perfect trendy casual spot. You can go in jeans or be dressed up on your way out for the night!  Will 100% be back the next time I'm swinging through Vegas.",

Our waitress took 10-15 to take our drink order then never brought it to us. We saw her walking around but she never came to check on us. We couldn't flag her down since she was across the room. She was not busy helping other patrons. After another 10 minutes the manager (I think) came by and I explained how we were still waiting for our drinks and have yet to order. He took our order down and brought our drinks. Clearly this waitress is completely incompetent and doesn't understand what her job is. The waitress checked on us one time after we got our dishes.   We shared the chips and salsa ($4) for the table. The seasoning on the chips were good. The salsa was a little unique but good. I tried the chilorio de puerco taco ($5.50) and the dan dan mian ($13.88). Both were good dishes but very expensive for the portion.  After leaving the restaurant I looked at the receipt again... I realized that they charged $2 for a side of hot sauce. The hot sauce was served in a small dish. They did not give us the bottle. First off I think it's complete crap for a restaurant to charge for hot sauce. If you're going to squirt a tiny amount into a dish and serve it then you should let your customers know that there's an extra charge for it. What a rip-off!!!  The food was decent but the service was awful. I would never recommend this restaurant to any of my friends.",

After checking out the Yelp rating, I was a bit reticent but gave it a go, figuring that we were only going for a quick pre-dinner bite, and we were standing right in front of it. We sat at the counter and took advantage of its \"Social Hour\" menu. We had (or I had) the classic margarita (no complaint except for ask for easy salt if your tolerance for salt is low), the cochinita taco (5/5), fried wontons (4/5), quesadilla chicharron (6/5!) and the sticky wings (4/5). The quesadilla was sooooo incredibly goooood. They chop up the chicharron so you get little crispy bits that are perfectly crispy with each bite.  So. Damn. Good. And the cochinita taco was most excellent too. One of the best seasoned/textured tacos I've ever had. But then, it better be, seeing as it was $4, at happy hour pricing, and it was ONE taco for the order. But it was worth it.  The fried wontons were a bit too... shrimpy. The fishy (?) taste of the shrimp slightly overwhelmed it, but the husband with the fish-aversion didn't mind eating it.  The sticky wings, while good, were kind of average.. good average, definitely filling. Probably the best bang-for-the-buck item on the Social Hour menu.  I'm thinking their Mexican food items are their strong suit, but we really didn't order enough so we'll have to revisit for a more thorough investigation of the menu.",

I would imagine knowing this menu takes a lot of practice, it was probably the only thing I didn't like.  Ordering was difficult, so many things. I'm usually not a big fan of tapas but the food here made up for it.  They have a tasting menu to make things easier but then you're at the mercy of the chef.  We tried about twice as many things with our group of 6 and paid less than the tasting menu price.  Worth a stop if you're near the Cosmo.",

The tofu was good but nothing special. The duck tongue taco was the best thing I tasted. If the order came with 2 tacos instead of 1 (actually i should say that with all the tacos on the menu!), I definitely would come back here more often. The mango sticky rice was actually meringue with mango sauce with chocolate flavored rice crispies on top. It tasted good but again I thought it wasn't worth $10. I can't say my experience was bad but I wouldn't say great either. I would say ok to good. The service and ambience were great. In general, this resto has good food but a little too overpriced for me to come back again... Note: Guacamole here is $15 with chips...",

He recommended some game changing dishes -- the shrimp mojo with a side of house made tortillas, the fish tacos, and some siu mai. Finished with the most perfect coconut rice and mango dessert. The drinks he made us are the best we've had in Vegas in years! I had a margarita served with hibiscus ice - beautifully presented. (We also tasted some delicious aguas frescas made daily in house.)  The food alone was amazing, but because of the relaxed and personal vibe Sergio created, we will be back time and time again. Truly, an authentic experience unlike anything we've encountered on the strip.",

    "text": "There's no Mexican-Asian fusion going on in this restaurant, except that the 2 menus and decor are intertwined. It's almost like someone could not decide if they wanted to open a Mexican restaurant or Chinese restaurant, so they decide to open both in the same space, with separate kitchens. I love both Mexican food and Chinese food, but this is neither here nor there. Two cuisines that are normally best in a hole-in-the wall spot, and inexpensive - this is just the opposite: overpriced and mediocre.  We ordered everything family style and tried to get a good mix of both Mexican & Chinese food:  Blood Orange Chile Pequin Margarita ($15) - I liked this margarita a lot. I don't care for the taste of tequila, and the blood orange seemed to mask this well. It had a spicy kick to it, but not so spicy that it was undrinkable.  Guacamole & Chips ($15) - Handmade, and delicious, but the price is about double what I would expect to pay for fresh guacamole. Chips were light, crispy and fresh.  Tacos (about $5 each) - I'm used to dollar tacos (maybe $2) at a taco truck. I got the Tinga Poblana and it was good, but unless I'm expensing my meal to work, I would pass on this - much too expensive for tacos.  Lamb Potstickers Stuck on You ($12.88) - 6 pieces - This was probably one of my favorite dishes of the night. The lamb inside was tasty and I liked the crispy lace (sweet onions) design on the dish. Would recommend this.  Sui Mai ($13.88) - 6 pieces - The only cool thing about this were the gold flakes on top. The rest was just okay, and tasted heavy on the ginger. At a normal dim sum restaurant, you can get 4 sui mai's for $4 that taste better.  Dan Dan Mian ($12) - Wheat noodles and spicy pork sauce - This was definitely spicy, nothing that blew me away though. At least the price was reasonable for the portion-size.  Col de Bruselas ($12) - These are on the acidic side - tasted really limey. I wouldn't get this again.  Shrimp Mojo ($18) - 8 pieces of shrimp = $2.25 per piece of shrimp. Sauce was good, not too spicy, this was one of the better dishes we had.  Bistec con Mole Amarillo y Hongos ($20) - Grilled hanger steak with mole - there were about 6 sliced pieces of steak - again, with the small portions. It was one of the better tasting dishes we had, but expensive.  All in all, it's an interesting concept and I was there for work so I was able to expense my meal. With tip and tax, it was $60 per person - quite honestly, I would rather eat at a Mexican food truck or a hole-in-the-wall Chinese place for 1/4 of the price and more authentic food. With so many other options in Vegas, I'll be going elsewhere.",

I had the chilequiles and the bean taco. The chilequiles were quite good, but the chips were soggy by the time I got them from all the delicious tomatillo sauce. The bean taco really wasn't impressive. It was covered with raw onions which kind of ruined it for me. The homemade tortilla was definitely the standout (I also sat at the bar and watched them being made... Neat!).  Could have definitely stood to have a wider variety of vegetarian offerings.  If they did I would probably come back.",

    "text": "My traveling companions decided to go and get pampered at a hotel spa and rely on a trained professional to provide some comfort into their lives, but I nixed that idea because for me comfort comes in the form of good food passing from my mouth to my belly.  I found myself exploring the Cosmopolitan on my own when I came upon this unique second floor restaurant which announced Chinese food in one window and Mexican food in another.  I stopped to study the menu and learned it was exactly what I thought it to be, a restaurant specializing in dim sum, noodles and tacos.  Since I was dining alone I was seated at the dim sum bar where I had a front row seat watching the ladies prepare, fill and fold fresh dumplings (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog?select=zE32BWJoqOAZL4TmaNlT3w\">yelp.com/biz_photos/GJ_b...</a>) and roll out fresh hand-cut noodles.  I decided to order from both the Chinese and Mexican menus in order to sample the cuisine a little bit better.  For starters I ordered one of two Agua Frescas (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog?select=W60P4p4WhAKZMHqhVyGHmw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/GJ_b...</a>) available at the time choosing one made of blood oranges and pomegranates.  From the Dim Sum menu I selected the Sui Mai Scallops made up of ground pork, bamboo, mushrooms and peanuts and the Har Gau which combined shrimp and pork belly in its filling.  From the Tacos menu I selected an individual Carnitas taco and the Pescado Frito taco.  I agreed to have my selections brought out as they were prepared.  The Pescado Frito (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog?select=8cIp34h9uM_xmdh4LajsUg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/GJ_b...</a>) taco arrived first.  On paper this was supposed to be fried fish and a Mexican salsa, but the fish I had inside my taco certainly didn't seem fried.  No matter its preparation I liked it as the flaky fish was bursting with flavor and hot juices running amok.  This was a very simple but very good fish taco.  The Carnitas taco (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog?select=9WJy0kQq33M7dBVaCtAbNw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/GJ_b...</a>) was up next.  This was braised baby pork, creamy guacamole, chicharrones and lime at its best.  When the server told me this was her favorite it took me just one bite to understand why.  If I really wanted to pig out I could have easily devoured another three of these.  The dim sum were served in individual bamboo steamers with the lids left on until I was ready to enjoy.  This helped keep the little morsels hot and steamy while I worked on my tacos.  I had the Har Gau (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog?select=ugVecr8s4E13Ak4f0t3P8w\">yelp.com/biz_photos/GJ_b...</a>) first.  These were quite unique as there was actually a pocket of broth inside the chewy, translucent shell much like what is usually experienced with xiao lung baos.  The shrimp was so fresh it was crunchy and while I didn't notice anything special with the added pork belly the juicy har gau was delicious enough to stand on its own.  I saved the Sui Mai Scallops (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog?select=OG_yUcneFS9wu0I9ejqQLg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/GJ_b...</a>) for last.  These were easily some of the most eye-appealing sui mais I've ever had topped with a bit of tobiko and some micro greens.  In terms of flavor and originality it was another winner.  The soft peanuts mixed in with the pork and the mushrooms gave these a very pleasant earthiness.  I enjoyed each one slowly, and stayed in my seat contemplating the delicious food I just sampled until it was time to meet up with my friends again.  Uh, guys, I won't be joining you for dinner tonight.  I'm stuffed!!",

    "text": "I came to China Poblano a few years ago and had a pretty great experience, so was anxious to take my boyfriend here on my most recent trip about a month ago, and man oh man was I severely disappointed.   The concept of serving Mexican and Chinese food in the same restaurant is intriguing and in an odd way, works extremely well. No matter what dish you end up ordering, the food is definitely good. That's where my two stars come from. So A+ on the food and even the unique decor.   The service though... oh man the service. Quite horrendous. First, we had a 20 minute wait for a table, but when our name was finally called we were sat at the bar (apparently bar is not self-seating here, but requires a host to seat you here). My boyfriend and I like sitting across from each other during meals, so felt a little odd to be next to each other, but nonetheless, it didn't bother us much as it was kind of fun to sit up where we could experience the action of the bartender and tortilla chef first-hand. We started off by ordering a drink each and an order of chips and salsa (which I must say, considering 95% of Mexican restaurants give chips & salsa for free, this was a little pricey here). They weren't bad, but I have had better elsewhere. We then ordered 4 tacos (2 tacos each). About 20 minutes after ordering, 1 taco was delivered. Where the other 3 were, we had no idea. We asked the bartender, who was also our waiter, and he had no idea either. He went to the kitchen to check and came back to tell us it would just be a few more minutes. About another 20 minutes passed by, and 2 more tacos were delivered. We were still missing the 4th and questioned where that one may be. Finally, another 10 minutes later, the 4th and final taco had been delivered. This long wait for 4 measly tacos was just ridiculous to me. The bartender did try to help, but it fell a little short. He could not offer to compensate us for the drinks we've already ordered, but he did tell us we could each order one more drink and those would be on the house, so we took up his offer and ordered 2 more drinks.We then got our check, paid and left, dissatisfied, and still very hungry.   The next day, my boyfriend noticed that the amount charged on his card was more than was on the initial bill. They ended up charging him for the 2 \"on the house\" drinks. This issue has still not been resolved.   I really love the food here and the atmosphere is fun, I just really wish the service would improve and that free drinks were truly free.",

    "text": "I didn't really know what to expect from a Chinese/Mexican place, but I was happily surprised. One thing you should know, though: It's not a fusion place. There's Mexican dishes and Chinese dishes and a heartwarming anecdote about a Chinese girl getting kidnapped by the Spanish empire explaining the name of the restaurant.   We had my baby nephew in tow . . . and he's a heartbreaker. So we got terrific service. A high chair, attentive service, helpful beyond the norm. Our server clearly knew the menu too and offered us lots of great suggestions.   My one regret is not ordering more Mexican food. I was more intrigued by (and our server offered more suggestions of) the Chinese food. It was tasty . . . although we didn't love the dumplings: too much dough, filling was too sweet. The tacos that we ordered were awesome, though. We got the carnitas. Delicious, but way too small for the price. Wish we'd gotten more.   All in all, I think it's a good bet. If you are a little adventurous, you can get a great meal for a not-too-bad price. Just bring a baby with you.",

    "text": "After reading the reviews, I was worried I would not be full after eating here.  I mean, let's be honest, I eat at an alarming rate.  I was hoping Jose Andres wouldn't let me down.    I think we were fortunate price-wise and portion-wise; as we came away full and with a relatively inexpensive tab.  Maybe it's because I wanted to save my drinks for the great bartenders at Chandelier, or because we weren't that full to begin with.  Nonetheless, we spent less than what we were prepared to spend, which is always good.  This place is not a Chinese/Mexican fusion.  It's primarily a menu with Chinese items and Mexican items.  The pozole soup was great and had an excellent spice.  The tacos were freshly prepared, I'd recommend the al pastor or the pork belly.  The Chinese menu was somewhat lacking, as if the items were forced on the menu without any great execution of the dishes to fit the theme.  It was pretty rowdy inside, but maybe because I was sitting next to a bachelorette party. I get the feeling it's like that normally. All in all, it was a nice experience, but I think I will stick to ordering from the to-go window.",

    "text": "I really liked it. Their service was top notch, very attentive and courteous staff who can definitely handle chaos. Being the only 2 casual eateries not counting the hidden pizza place in otherwise expensive restaurant land Cosmopolitan, they are slammed all the time. I passed by everyday staying there and it was like a street mob scene. Regardless, they had hired a bunch of cool cats who handled the situation well which I really liked because feeding hunger after walking around all day is one serious business.  The food was superb. Very very fine for street food. I loved it. Of course it was also because I expected nothing at all* Bah! Jose Andres? Oh no, not another Jose Andres joint, Tacos? Dim Sum? Oh whatever. So thats how I went in. But blow me down, I was dead wrong. They executed very well for what was just mindless street food in an expensive hotel. I shared  their beef tongue taco (excellent, low fat) , har kow (nice twist), viva china taco (didn't like this one, too fried), Cochinita taco (good), lobster taco (not special enough), Roujiamo Sandwich (good enough) and that was about it. I really loved the quality of their meat cuts.   Pricey? Yes, because tacos, dim sum etc. are not usually, thats the problem. But was it worth it? Yes again.  Atmosphere-- casual. So after all the partying and dressing up for great dinners, this is a welcome change. People are happy all around, not high and drunk like the other casual eateries because they don't serve up cheap fruit punch cocktails here.   Just too cool for that.",

Every time I head out to Las Vegas I try and make a point to dine but it just never worked out... that is until this week, when my boyfriend and I made it to lunch.  Finally!  Started off with cocktails (blood orange margarita), and I was impressed.  It was really well-balanced and not too sweet.  We had the guacamole, which was very good.  We ordered it \"medium\" but I think it could have used a little more kick.  The chips were fresh and completely addictive, and the salsa was really delicious- excellent smoky flavor.  We each ordered a taco (carnitas and pescado frito).  Serving size is small but we were going for a \"light lunch\" so it worked out.  My boyfriend liked the carnitas taco so much he ordered another.  It was really a decent amount of food when you consider the large, molcajete-like bowl of guacamole too.  All in all, it was pretty good!  It's hard to \"wow\" in Las Vegas because there are so many great restaurant choices.  The ambiance and decor are really neat and lend to the overall feel of the place.  We had great service and enjoyed the food a lot, but I definitely think it's more of a lunch spot.",

    "text": "I have Celiacs and I originally found this restaurant on a list of \"gluten sensitive\" restaurants in Las Vegas. However, the \"gluten sensitive\" menu offers very few Chinese choices - I'd say the menu is roughly 98% Mexican and 2% Chinese -- which was personally upsetting since I was really looking forward to gluten free Chinese food. Chinese food is typically hard to make gluten free - as soy sauce contains gluten but gluten free soy sauces do exist!! There was one noodle option on the menu \"Kao Lao Lao\", oat noodles with tiger sauce, next to this option was a little asterisk that just said \"contains soy sauce\". I asked the waitress if the soy sauce was gluten free and she said \"No\", and kind of chuckled and told me \"I wouldn't recommend that dish without the sauce though because it will just be plain boiled noodles.\" Ok. WHY WOULD THEY EVEN PUT IT ON THE MENU?! So the only options left for me were tacos. So much for my Chinese food craving. Whatever. Heck - even PF Changs does Gluten Free Asian food.   Additionally -- we weren't totally sure but the waitress never disclosed to us that food would be served tapas style and arrive at various times from THREE different kitchens. Had we known in advance of ordering that this was the case, we probably would have ordered differently. As everyone's dishes arrived separately, within 5 to 10 minutes of each other. Even all the tacos came out at different times. Food was just ok. My friend had the 20 Vegetable Fried Rice - which was apparently featured on Food Network - everyone at the table (aside from me - as it wasn't gluten free) agreed it wasn't special and tasted like standard take out Chinese food -- kind of basic. She had also added chicken to the rice for an additional $5; however, we were only able to find several chunks of chicken amidst the veggies. Not worth it.  All in all food was good - not great. Servers were nice - not welcoming. I don't think I would go back, there are better places in Vegas.",

Awesome decor--lucha libre meets Las Vegas--red lamps on the ceiling, video screens with pictures flashing of Mexican artist Frida Kahlo and Chinese leader Mao, etc.  Cons: The menu was extensive but underwhelming. A bit over-priced for such a casual setting that basically served fried rice and tacos. It's tapas style, so expect to order several dishes for sharing. I don't think it was a fusion, but rather a menu with average Chinese and Mexican dishes.",

    "text": "We were in town for a work event and decided to try China Poblano on our first night.   I was really looking forward to a margarita so after asking the bartender which one he recommended we decided to go with the Salt Air Margarita. Both my coworker that I was with and I are not salty margarita people, so we were a little hesitant but decided we might as well try it. The \"Salt Air\" is a sea salt foam that goes on top of the margarita itself. When you drink it you basically get a lot of salty foam and very little of the actual drink. BUT it was definitely unique! It was a little too much for me to drink a lot of the foam so I ended up getting a straw to get past it, but if you are a salted margarita fan - you will love this! It's definitely worth a try either way.   For food, we went with chips and salsa and we each try a few of the tacos. I love that you can mix and match the tacos since you pay for each one individually. Chips and salsa were awesome! I'm not sure what the seasoning was but it had a bit of a bit to it and was super delicious. I went with the Carnitas Tacos. Whoever decided that they needed to put Chicharrones on a taco is my new favorite person. It was the most delicious taco I have ever had. I'm not necessarily a fan of corn tortillas because they are usually pretty dry, but these were so moist and just went perfectly with the ingredients in our tacos that I wanted to come back for more a couple hours later!  Staff was great and super helpful with the menu and drink selections. Reasonably priced for Vegas which was an added bonus! We will definitely back on our next trip!",

We both agreed - the food was INSANELY DELICIOUS, the staff was incredible, and the fact that you can get a multi-course tasting menu for less than $50 - AND they have a full vegetarian option! - is just unbelievable.  We also appreciated that China Poblano isn't stuffy, formal, etc. - it's a nice casual restaurant where you can enjoy a meal and have fun - with super incredible food.  We were not expecting anything incredible, which just made it that much better.  Blown out of the water. I would definitely recommend it, and very much recommend the tasting menu.  (Honestly, the only downside is that the portions were bigger than any I've seen on a tasting menu and we weren't able to finish everything. We took home some noodles and a salad, but didn't finish the dessert - which felt like a horrible sin...)",

The guacamole was so tasty and salty. It paired so well with our salt and air margaritas. The queso with chorizo was warm, gooey, greasy and perfect with warm tortillas.   I was however very disappointed in the XO noodle dish. It was a very small serving with 4 shrimp, one scrambled egg and noodles rolled in balls. Flavor  was very faint. I could have skipped this entirely. They fooled me twice with the mango sticky rice dessert. I had my heart set on traditional mango sticky rice however the rice was not in the dish. It was more of whipped cream with a mango sauce, minimal mango tidbits, and a spoonful of rice crispy on top. Boo!!! It left me mad.   So 4-5 stars for the yummy Mexican food. 0-1 stars for the sad Asian offerings.",

They bring all the utensils and make the guac in front of you and ask how spicy you'd prefer it. All of their drinks were yummy. The presentation of everything was clean and nicely prepared. This is the first and only mexican/chinese combined restaurant I've been to, so I really didn't know what to expect. I thought this place was going to be like a mexican and chinese food fusion type of place, but they literally have mexican food and dim sum.   The flavors of everything were great. We ordered lots of dim sum and everything was A1.This was actually my first time trying dim sum too.  My favorite was the traditional Siu Mai and Har Gow. My other favorites were the Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice and Gan Pung Ji Chicken Wings. The chicken wings were kind of spicy and the fried rice was good as well. Just wished there was an option to add chicken or meat in it and it would've been perfect.   Dessert was the best part. The mango sticky rice was really sweet but the whip cream really complimented the cold mango. And the churros...Probably one of the best churros I've tasted in my life. Nice, hot and crispy. I didn't dip it in the chocolate sauce cause I didn't want a heart attack but man the desserts were so good.  Overall a solid place! If you have any cravings for dim sum or tacos this is going to hit the spot and fill that void.",

I ordered the pescado estilo baja taco, which is a fried seasonal fish, lime mayonnaise, cabbage and salsa pico Yucateco. It was absolutely delicious.

Perhaps tourists visiting Vegas from the Midwest will be more impressed than I was.",

    "text": "The idea of Mexican and Asian together is pure bliss, but this spot just misses it terribly. Let's start with the good, the decor and ambience are on point. You feel like you have gone into a hidden authentic Mexican or Asian village. You have the option to eat at the bar and watch them make the tortillas. Great for groups as well and they have an outdoor window you can pick up and go.   What makes this such a disappointment is the actual food. They have plenty of choices, but they don't do it justice with the flavors. We got the guac and chips which is made table side, which I lvoe because you can see the ingredients they put in it. Where they failed: stale chips we had to send back TWICE and the guac mixture. They bring you the guac and put it next to you. Then you wait until your server is free so they can mix it up. for us, it took 20 min for our server to mix it and she did a terrible job. The guac has huge chunks and we ended up remixing it ourselves. This leads me to my next point, Service. Terrible. I'm not sure if this is a Vegas thing or just in general at the Cosmopolitan hotel, but service is just terrible everywhere we went, especially here. No one provided recommendations of the menu, asked us for drinks, and took forever to just get some water.   After the guac and crap service we ended up getting the fish tacos and shrimps in aijio. I'm happy we stopped there because we were going to get the fried rice and some dim sum, but the tacos and shrimp were so bad we said forget it and left somewhere else. The fish tacos were overly fried and overly drenched in mayo to the point it was disgusting to look at. The shrimps did not look like all the other yelp photos. It was beyond soaked and swimming in the sauce that as truly terrible. I NEVER like to leave food, but here we could barely eat it.   Just overall misses the mark. Oh well. Good idea though.",

The drinks were amazing as well. Their specialty cocktails have a pretty good kick and lots of flavor. Our service was fabulous.

Tuna ceviche, also salty AF. Whoever seasoned this was over zealous with the salt. It's so salty it is almost rendered inedible.   The Dian Dian Mien... did we only order a half portion??? For $14, you'd figure you would get more than what appears 14 noodles. $1/noodle??? Portion size is overwhelmingly disappointing. Also, SALTY AF.  Mongolian Beef Lettuce... HELLA EFFIN SALTY!!!!! I get that lettuce tends to be bland, but there's no need to drown the lettuce in salty ass sauce.   Cheese Fundido was cool. Tastes like tequila!   Traditional Shui Mai was ok. (Cost value, no bueno. Gold flakes does not compensate) only eat 1 piece... the 2nd one is too salty!   Har Gow was ok. Smallest har gow I have ever seen!   Sticky Lotus Rice was ok. Well, the first bite or two. Then it also becomes too salty.   Pozole was pretty good!   Piss poor choice for tea cups. Cast iron???? You guys know it conducts heat, right??? So you end up with a hot AF cup. FAIL. The cup is so hot you're burning your fingers to pick it up. Then burning your lips on the cup, and all only to drink lukewarm tea. ULTIMATE FAIL!!!

Exactly what you expect them to be. Though the sauce that it comes with was not very good. I used it sparingly. Next up I had the 6 piece Dim Sum. I forget the exact name, but it's the one that's a preselected mix of 3 Sio Mai. These were on the salty side for me, but edible. Next I had the lengua taco. Also on the salty side. I wish the tortilla was thicker or was a double tortilla. It would have balanced the saltiness out. Then I had the carnitas taco. It was also salty. But it had a lime with it and other toppings that help cut the saltiness down. Again I wish it was a thicker tortilla or double tortilla for the taco. My friend had some noodles from the vegan menu which came back so salty we had to just send it back. The best thing ordered was the vegan fried rice. It was actually seasoned well with a nice balance for the toppings and ingredients.  All in all, the price and quality of the food is not worth paying or coming back for. In all honesty, it would be better to just go to a hole in the wall  tacqueria somewhere or find a dim sum place in an Asian neighborhood. I don't believe this mix or mishmash of flavors were executed well. DEFINITE PASS.",

Knowing it was a long shot, I called the restaurant and left a really weird and vague message knowing that even if they found it, no one would even know what it was.  Until only moments ago, after receiving a call from Catherine the night manager, did I know the integrity of the waitstaff and management as she is shipping my beloved torqbar to me tomorrow morning.

If you're like me, the thought of Chinese-Mexican fusion seems like a shot of tequila too far. Not so! After every fusion dish we found ourselves saying, \"I don't know why this works, but it's the best [insert gastronomic marvel here] I've ever had.  Pros: Affordable food prices; Amazing, changing decor; Friendly servers and wait staff; Incredible cocktails (Try the Salt Air Margarita); Not at all stuffy or pretentious; Straightforward menu presentation; Welcoming atmosphere;  INCREDIBLE FUSION FOOD.  Cons: Still getting used to paying $8 for a Tsingtao (I don't think I pay that much for a six-pack back home); Tacos are good, but pale in comparison to the rest of the menu.  Do get: Dan Dan Mian (spicy, vinagery, peanuty, sticky, delicious noodles); Golden Pigs and Stuck on You dim sum...Still in shock about these.  Don't get: Lengua tacos (on the blander side, even for beef tongue, with a near-tasteless brown sauce on top).  Desert: Mango sticky rice with so many twists and turns that you'll be walking out of there with your head and your mouth still spinning.",

We started with chips & salsa, and a wonderful Flaca margarita made with house orange infused tequila. Marrying Chinese and Mexican cuisines is an overdue creative concept. We shared Chef Jose's take of small plate dim sum. His interpretation of traditional Siu Mais were more tender than typical presentation. We especially liked the Golden Pigs-deep fried BBQ pork bun with condensed milk. A bit pricey but this is Vegas. Of the two versions of traditional Chinese noodles, we preferred the nicely plated Ants Climbing Tree with glass noodle, chicken and pea shoot to the Dan Dan Mian with mundane ground pork sauce. The Mongolian Beef with romaine lettuce and shishito pepper was pleasingly delicious. Overall, innovative and quite flavorful.",

The waiter, anthony, was able to explain the differences in the tacos ingredients and flavors.   The manager Steve , was very approachable and worked the room well. It was my first time in and I will definitely be back.   I had the 20 ingredient rice. It was good. It was really basic fried rice with seasonal ingredients, so not really a must have.   The when pigs fly was very good. The steamed buns with Chinese pork and BBQ sauce was very flavorful.   I had several of the tacos. The best was the lamb , Barbacoa Cordero.  Very tasty and buttery. Melted in my mouth. The other favorite was the Barbacoa de Res. The beef was flavorful and tender. My only improvement would be to layer I some more flavors. They could have used some salt and a little More heat.    If you are near the cosmopolitan and looking for a great casual place, come into China Poblano. You will enjoy it.",

It's a great place to go for a quick bite or a late bite but my advice is to stay away from the Asian side of the menu, which in our opinion is one cut above a PF Chiang's. We've literally never had anything very impressive from that side of the menu. Not that it's bad, just... ordinary and a bit overpriced for what it is. The Mexican side of the menu is another story. Literally the opposite is True. We've never had something from that side that we didn't enjoy. Service is quick and friendly. Enjoy the Poblano, stay away from the China.",

I've been eating Chinese steamed pork buns since I was a little kid. These ALMOST taste like the ones my grandmother made. So good - Flautas in mole sauce       == These little crispy guys were decent. The mole sauce was pretty tasty, but this dish wasn't mind blowing.  - Beef Shu Mai       == I've had tons of shu mai before, but these guys were a little different with the watermelon radish on top and a little bit of lime zest. Don't get me wrong, they were yummy, but had a little something different from homestyle shu mai. - Pozole Rojo      == This was the best dish of the entire night. The soup was spicy full of flavor. The pork was super tender and the additional radish, avocado, onion, and cabbage made the dish phenomenal. I would come back here for the pozole. My only complaint is that it was a tad on the salty side. - Chicharron Quesadilla      == A quesadilla is a quesadilla. This one just happened to have crispy little chicharron pieces in it. It also came with a spicy chili sauce.   We also had some drinks there (The Singapore Sling, The Orient, Blood Orange margarita and Pomegranate margarita) and they were all delicious. The Singapore Sling is a sweet and fruity drink so if that's your style, go for that. The Orient was like a fancy spruced up gin and tonic. The Blood Orange margarita was awesome and spicy. The pomegranate margarita had a salt foam on top which was totally different, but a little too much of it for my liking.   Overall, a win. I came here twice during my Vegas stay. That has to mean something, right?",

It was interesting to see that in the front of house, there were two kitchens.  A Mexican kitchen and a Chinese kitchen on opposite ends.  I was hoping for more fusion entrees, but there were only a few.  The menu was predominantly Mexican or Chinese.    Setas Tacos: Mushroom tacos.  Nothing special.  It felt it needed some kind of fresh vegetable in there to add some crunch.  Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice: Actually pretty good with an amazing variety of vegetables in it.  Good flavors, season well.  Is it worth paying $16 for fried rice...however good it may be?  Questionable.  The Unruly Monk: Hand-cut noodle soup.  When it came out, it smelled absolutely amazing and then it went downhill from there.  The hand-cut noodles were overcooked and mushy.  The broth lacked flavor.  Beijing Glass: My friend had this one.  It actually had a nice crunch and was refreshing.  I'd call this dish a success.  Guacamole: This was really good guacamole with just a hint of heat.  But $12 for only one cup of guac????  C'mon...that's crazy talk.   Papas Fritas with XO Sauce: Interesting concept, but WOW...that XO sauce is extremely overpowering and extremely greasy.  I had about 4 fries, but after that, it was too much.  Happy Buddha Giggling Taking a Bath: It seemed like a pretty fun dessert.  How can you not like a jello mold of Buddha sitting in lychee foam??  It was fun to squeeze his cheeks to make his mouth move, but it was pure novelty and not worth the $10.   All-in-all, it was some hits, but more misses.  Great service kinda made up for it.",

I did love the spring rolls and Beijing Glass. I was not impressed with the tofu. The cocktails were decent. They didn't have a wait. It is tapas style and 2 kitchens going on at the same time. So do not wait for someone to get their food. You never know when or what is coming out next.",

The bill was $442 and we were still hungry afterwards.  I would no recommend this place at all.  Another problem with this place is the hosts always put the customers in the same section instead of utilizing the entire restaurant.  So annoying. All in all, food tastes bad and the portion sizes are very small.",

Yea it's not cheap, and yea it's small plates, but yea it's pretty damn good. You're in vegas, relax, enjoy it and stop being so cheap... Or go find a strip mall with a Panda Express and a Roberto's and enjoy that with your malt liquor. PS - everyone that is complaining about price, realize what hotel you are in.

But it was the food that will definitely have us dining here again. Three of the four of us had the shrimp tacos and we all agreed they were the best we ever had (the corn tortillas were to die for). We also tried When Pigs Fly (AMAZING!!!) and some pork dumplings. We tried a couple other tacos - the brisket and the carnitas. Our waitress, Paola, was wonderful - she looked after us well and offered great suggestions. I never imagined a Mex-Asian fusion would work as well as it does, but, believe me, it does. Highly highly recommended.",

Five fifty for    one taco that I can consume In 4 bites is a little high.  Though the carnitas is delicious, it is still not worth the price.  Same can be said for the 20 vegetable fried rice.

Don't bother with this restaurant --go elsewhere.   The food had the potential to be spectacular --but there was no real 'fusion' of the different flavors. I've been to Jose Garces restaurants in Philly and expected Chef Andres' restaurants to have innovative flavors and fusing of cultures.  I was wrong. there was a 'mexican' side and a 'chinese' side of the menu.  Both of which were adequate at best.  The Posole was the only thing we liked.  The salad was ok too.   The moles and pipian had no resemblance to the rich and flavors we find in Mexico, or good Mexican food in Oaxacan restaurants.  All the tacos were extremely oversauced so you couldn't taste the meat.  the noodle dish we ordered tasted like they dumped the entire bottle of rice vinegar in it.  When we told the waitress, she scolded me and said 'that's how it's supposed to taste' to which I replied \"actually no it's not --if you'd listened to us as we ordered you would realize you have a table who are familiar with the cuisine. \" She agreed to take it back and off the bill. However when the bill came, she still charged us and I had to argue with her to take it off.  Oh and the 2 of us who ate that dish got sick later.   It was hard not to notice that the wait staff was more attentive to all the white men around us. As a group of women of color --it was disappointing that we had to spend so much time finding our servers to make requests whether it was for more water or to make a complaint.   At $60 per person --we expect better service and to be treated with respect.",

    "text": "It's Chinese.  It's Mexican. It's . . . not bad.  Ah, fusion restaurants.  So hip, so stylish.  They promise the best of both worlds.  But when they fail, the offer double the . .  . dishes that rise to the level of \"pretty good\".    For all it's hype (and man, was this place hyped as part of the newly-opened Cosmopolitan), China Poblano fails to deliver the amazing meal that could have been from the combination of Chinese food and Mexican food on one menu.  It has interesting choices, but the dishes just don't rise to the quality of the better Mexican and Chinese restaurants in Vegas and China Poblano is double the price.      First, the Mexican dishes.  We ordered several tacos.  The mole chicken was bland.  Seriously, the mole sauce was bland.  A chocolate-based sauce was bland.  The other tacos we ordered combined braised pork with a fried pork rind.  It felt gimmicky. The pork rind just took away from the impressively tender and tasty braised pork.  Remove the pork rind and that's a pretty tasty taco.  The pork itself was delicious, but not enough to bring me back when I'm craving Mexican food when Vegas has so many tasty taquerias.  As for the Chinese offerings, we ordered the Vegetable Noodles and the bbq pork dumplings (When Pigs Fly).  The noodles were good and the sauce was delicious, but again, it just didn't rise to the level of amazing that I expected.  On a positive note, the dumplings in When Pigs Fly were tender, the bbq sauce was sweet and tangy and I recommend them if you head over to China Poblano.  We also splurged and tried the dish \"Like Water for Chocolate,\" which local reviewers have been raving about.  It's a tapas-sized portion of fried quail with dragon fruit in dragon fruit sauce, which is beautifully arranged (as were most dishes -- one thing this place knows is artful presentation).  But after having the dish, I don't quite understand the rave reviews.  Dragon fruit is essentially tasteless, but juicy and offers very little to the dish other than its undeniably cool name.  The waitress told us that the chefs add citrus into the dragon fruit sauce to add some flavor, but when we had it, the flavors could be described as subtle at best, and absent at worst.  The quail itself was pretty damn tasty if you don't mind crunching through a bone or two in your fried nuggets.  At $8, I'd say it's worth ordering.  At $15, stay away.   The best parts of our meal were the fresh guacamole, pomegranate margarita and the entire desert menu.  The guacamole was exceptional and included a wonderful mix of Oaxaca cheese.  The pomegranate margarita is a little piece of food art with a sweet, sharp taste and topped with an inventive salt foam.  And this place is known for its deserts.  We had the flan and it gets a big thumbs up.  Bottom line: 3 stars with some dishes rising to the level of \"good to great,\" but most sitting around \"not bad:.  Add in the high prices for tapas portions and it's a solid 3.  Four of the dishes made me want to cheer, the others rose to the level of not bad.",

So come on people..  My rant is over...  After having eaten at China Poblano, which my first Jose Andres dining experience, I will likely name my first child after him, then force my child to name their first born after him.  The food and drinks are playful and just flat out phenomenal.  I opened the night with his Salt Air Margarita, which has salt water foam on the top of it rather than a salted rim, and it was hands down one of the best margaritas I've had.  The bartender explained the Jose developed the idea after he was swimming in the sea and swallowed some salt water, then viola!  To kick off the food, I ordered barbacoa and pescado tacos.  Have you ever had food that is so good that you just smile after eating it?  Well this does just that.  I then switched gears to the China portion of the menu and had When Pigs Fly, which is 4 BBQ pork steam buns.  The buns are light and doughy while the inside is a burst of unbelievable flavor.  Last, but not least, I had to fuse the two worlds, so I had the tuna ceviche, which was an interesting take on the classic by adding soy sauce and roasted amaranth seeds.    I was convinced the first time here would not be the last, but unfortunately I had scheduled work dinners throughout the week that screwed this plan up.  Luckily, I was able to convince a group to take me here, and the second time was just as good as, if not better than, the first time.  Bravo, Senor Andres.",

Food- only went for a light meal.. Dan Dan Mian- by far the best thing we had. Super spicy and definitely interesting flavones. I would order again..  Hot n sour soup- GROSS. Had the worst consistency and made me feel like I was holding spit in my mouth. Flavors weren't good, disappointed as I really wanted soup.  Street pork bun- tasted like soap? Not sure what was up with it but for 8 dollars the thing was no more than 2-3 inches. Left a weird bad taste in my mouth.   Overall I wasn't thrilled on my meal. Will I return?

I had done some research prior to the trip, and China Poblano was on my list of places to eat. And even though we had reservations for dinner in about 3 hours time, I stopped in kinda pigged out. I started with pork and shrimp fried won tons. These were melt in your mouth, savory deliciousness. They came with a sesame dipping sauce and they were just what I had hoped for. Because the menu is Chinese and Mexican food, I felt the need to try a taco too. I went with the setas taco, which is wild mushroom and guacamole. And also very tasty. To drink, I had one of the juices of the day, which was cherry. If I drank alcohol, I could've had that as a mimosa. When I was finished, I was presented a dessert menu. Now, I knew better, but they had churros, so I had to go for it. Those were decent and came with Mexican hot chocolate for dipping. I personally found the flavors didn't mix well, but others might think it's delicious. I ate the churros and drank the hot chocolate, win-win.  China Poblano isn't cheap, but nothing within the walls of the Cosmopolitan is. I was on vacation and I didn't care. If you are on a budget, I'd take a look at the prices first, but I promise, it will be money well spent if you go for it.",

    "text": "I think china poblano is a very solid 3 stars, I gave it a fourth star because our second visit was on the busiest night in Vegas...NYE and we had no reservation. They accommodated us quickly, although it was at the outside tables but that's fine by me...more people to watch.  Our server was great, I have no complaints about the service.  My husband & I ordered chips & salsa which were great, good seasoned chips, salsa was smokey and far from any pico de gallo. We also ordered 4 tacos...2 fish, 1 cochinita (BBQ Pork) and 1 carnitas. We've had the fish tacos before and they were delish...this time they were totally different. The fish wasn't very battered, and the salsa was way different. Definitely not as good this time around but still very decent. The other tacos were full of flavor but very small! We both said we could eat 4 more! So after the chips & salsa & 2 tacos each we were still hungry so we ordered dim sum. A 4 piece order of When Pigs Fly and they were a knock out. Very good.  Now, a part of me wants to take a star off because of the high prices. This dinner was over $70 and I really couldn't justify paying more than $35-$40. You can't call this a full dinner. It was more like a lite bite before a concert type thing.  The kicker was the 2 cokes my husband ordered during dinner. They came in glass bottles and are imported from Mexico. I've seen them at my local grocery store...they sell them 10 for $10. For all of you yelpers that are not math geniuses, that's $1 ea. China Poblano charges $5.88 each!! Holy coca cola! $12 on two cokes?! That's a little unreal. In a separate visit we ordered the 20 vegetable fried rice--as featured on one of those television food shows--and it was good not amazing. This is not a place I NEED to return to. But it's also not a place I would stay away from. Although, I might smuggle in my own Mexican Coca Cola next time.",

    "text": "The food here was fantastic. It is designed to be eaten as small plate, family style dining, so we ordered 7 plates for 3 people for dinner. That was a perfect amount of food for the three of us (all girls, but one big eater!). Plus we split two desserts, but could have easily done one.  Everything was delicious, but the standouts were the golden pig steamed buns, Dan Dan noodles, mango sticky rice and the duck tongue tacos.  Cocktails were tasty. Reasonable for Vegas, although definitely pricey if you are going to eat a full meal with cocktails, mains, and dessert.  My one huge complaint was the service, and only very specifically in regards to the hostess. When we arrived, we checked in and were told without a reservation the wait could be 45 minutes to an hour, but since we were willing to sit anywhere that was first available (bar or table) usually something would open in about 20 minutes. We were escorted to the waiting area, and a server came by very quickly to offer us drinks. Then we were basically ignored for an hour and a half, when everyone around us (also without a reservation) was seated first, despite having similarly sized groups. When the hostess did acknowledge us, every time she promised that we were next to be seated and we were just waiting for a table to open up. Except that each time, she indicated a different table that we were waiting for.  When bar seats finally did open up an hour into our wait, she told us that we were just waiting for a table to leave - that they had already paid, and then showed another group to that table. When a table finally did open up, there was a huge miscommunication among the staff about who was going to get it, which arrangement and so on.  I feel like if we had not been persistent about being seated, we would have been completely ignored.  I wouldn't have been so cranky about the wait time if my expectations had been properly managed from the beginning-customer service 101. When, 40 minutes in, she kept telling us that we would be seated right away, we just got more irritated every time that turned out to be unTrue. If we were honestly kept apprised of the situation, we likely would have elected to come back another night with a reservation.  Since we had been basically repeatedly misinformed, my friend asked if we could please have a complimentary guacamole for the wait. The hostess was super reluctant to help us and said she would have to ask her boss, but as soon as our server came to the table, the server offered to bring us some on the house. After we were in the server's hands, the dinner was fantastic. Food came out really fast and the servers were friendly and efficient.  The hostess was likely enough to keep me from returning, at least for awhile, and definitely not without a reservation. When I pay $180 for a meal, I expect to treated with at least honesty and courtesy by every staff member, especially the \"face\" of the restaurant.",

    "text": "I enjoyed the stylish atmosphere, however the food was okay.  The music and decor created an upbeat, enjoyable atmosphere. Although seating is limited in the dining room, they do offer seats at the bar(s). They have two sets of bars.   The menu is broken into two different sections: Chinese and Mexican. I chose two Chinese items.   The lamb pot stickers were okay. The pot stickers presentation was nice. All four of the pot stickers were elegantly made together to appear like a pizza with four perforations that made separation from each other much easier. They had an odd smell and no real flavor. The pot stickers were simple there to eat. Would I order them again? No.   The second item I ordered was the Ocean's Nest. It had a wonderful medley of vegetables and seafood nestled on top of the crispy, fried noodles. Although I expected soft noodles for the dish, the crispy noodles become soft as the lightly sauced dish saturated some of the noodles. I wasn't a big fan of the crispness of the noodles particularly when trying to cut the noodles so it was easier for me to eat. I thought the dish wasn't bad. I would have been happier with soft noodles, but the vegetables and seafood were tasty. Would I order the item again? Probably not.  I did think the menu prices were quite reasonable for what I ordered. Overall, the atmosphere makes for nice conversation, but better food can be found elsewhere.",

We shared the restaurant's version of hot and sour soup, which was spicy and creative and delicious.  I ate most of it.  Then we ordered the 20 vegetable fried rice and the bok choy.  The twenty vegetable fried rice, for all the youtube videos we'd seen about it, was a bit of a let-down, because there was a lot less veggies than the promo's had celebrated.  It was also a bit oily, which was a surprise, as I figured they'd had that part perfected.  The flavor was good.  The bok choy was also interesting, as it had a bit of citrus flavor, and it was thoughtfully prepared and not overcooked.  We also tried the guava agua fresca, which was refreshing and not too sweet. Overall the food was better than good, and the service was great.  However, the place looks like a fast food joint from the outside, totally degrading its menu.  And once inside, it also appears cheaper than it should.  Also the pictures of the Mexican and Chinese people were sort of strange, especially the one of the Dali Lama, whose ethnicity is vague.",

    "text": "Like a 4.47 rounded all the way up because the Lakers are on a 4-game winning streak.   I came to China Poblano during its opening week. A couple feet ahead of me, at the front of the restaurant, was Big Papi himself: Jose Andres. Wearing baby blue, tweeting from his Blackberry, eating what looked like every single dish on the menu, teaching his three daughters (who were sitting in descending order by height) how to use chopsticks - how cute.       Anyway, the food. The bottom-line for me at any restaurant is the final product. The flavors, the textures, the temperature contrasts, all the good shit, working in unison to evoke memories or tell new stories. Value, ambiance, service - that stuff's nice, too - but I'm not going to knock off stars from any restaurant if the waitress didn't fill my cup of coffee six times, or if I couldn't understand the gibberish coming out of the Filipino waitress' mouth. Notably, the ambiance and service at this restaurant were super-chill (like, 5/5 chill).   Having said that, the food here was generally very good, too. (We ordered the guacamole, fried potatoes with XO, chicken mole tacos, the lemon-tree shrimp, and some other stuff I can't remember right now. The ocean nest was fine, too.) The dessert menu didn't excite me, but the drinks made up for it (salt air margarita and the sal de gusano margarita). Also, Jose was gangster enough to get out of his seat (during his meal!) to make sure I had a good time. Check it out.",

We were starving (which usually allows crappy food to taste a little better) and just went for what was close.  I should have known that a Chinese/Mexican restaurant would not be a good idea.  There is a reason why I've never come across this mix.  It's because it simply does not work!  This restaurant should either focus on making better Chinese food or better Mexican, not attempt to make both types of cuisines.  I had the dan dan noodles and some soup with wontons (the name escapes me now).  The dan dan  noodles were okay.  The soup didn't have much flavor.  It's only saving grace were the wontons.  My boyfriend ordered one lobster taco (because they are $10 a pop) and two chicken tacos (mole sauce on the side).  He said the lobster taco was good, but the chicken was just whatever.  Overall, the best thing that we ordered was the guacamole and the Mexican coke.  The chips and salsa were decent.",

    "text": "We were visiting from Out Of Town over Christmas and saw this place on one of the Hotel Channels in our room. I am a huge foodie, as is my partner and this place caught our eye as being a GREAT IDEA.   My boyfriend LOVES Dim Sum and all things Chinese Food while I am a BBIIGGGG fan of Latin Food, especially Ceviche.   While wandering the mall Christmas day we stumbled onto this spot by pure chance and decided to jump all over it. We were seated right away and initially noticed and beautiful decor. Whomever designed the inside of this place really had a solid idea in mind, the colours are bright and the themes meshes well with the Asian/ Mexican fusion.   We ordered the drink we had seen on the ad, which was there Salt Air Margarita. It was really yummy. The Salt Foam really does coat the tongue and give you a very different experience as far as margarita drinking goes.    For our food we ordered the Dim Sum Pot Stickers and the Ceviche plus a Taco.   Dim Sum - Fair. Needed more flavor, stuffed with enough meat, but was lacking a solid taste.  Ceviche - Bad. We had the Snapper ceviche. It was so very bland, almost no flavor. I had to ask for Lime wedges to add onto the dish to give it some flavor. There was ZERO spice, and I am fairly sensitive to spicy foods. I'd HIGHLY recommend they add some sort of cirtus to their Cevich.   Taco -  Decent. Meat had solid taste and was really tender, the tortilla was grand.   Over all, it's a really great idea to fuse these two cuisines, I just think the technique missed the mark a little. They seem to carter to a specific type of person who doesn't seem to explore a lot of foods and it would be great to see them branch out and add more True flavors.  Come for the drinks. Not for the food.",

So we walked around for 20 minutes through The Cosmopolitan trying to find anything that sounded good.  We found this place and it looked and sounded decent enough.  And who doesn't like a place where you can order both Asian and Mexican?  After a short wait, we were seated and it seemed to take awhile to see our waiter and then get our orders in.  In the meantime, I ordered a salt air margarita.  It was super tasty but for $14, it was kind of teeny.  Especially when it seems the foam takes up 1/3 of the glass.  But it was a really superb margarita.  My friend ordered the fried buns with the condensed milk glaze.  I wasn't sure about them but they were actually kind of amazing.  I ordered the chicken poblano taco and the lobster taco.  The poblano taco was really good.  I should've just ordered two or three of those and been done but the lobster taco sounded so enticing.  Um, not so much.  It wasn't great and at $10, it was highway robbery.  All the other reviews are right.  These tacos are all crazy overpriced and they're tiny.  We ended with the sticky rice and mango dessert.  Not at all what I imagined but we still ate every last bite.  This place isn't bad, it was just a let-down.  I had high hopes looking at the menu and was a bit underwhelmed by the food and overwhelmed by the prices.  I wouldn't say not to eat here, just know what to expect.",

    "text": "I'm so thankful that I ignored the 3 star average reviews, and decided to give this wonderful, eclectic restaurant a try. I stayed at the Cosmopolitan 4 nights, and on my last night there, sauntered up to the hostess stand around 8:00 and asked to be seated. She asked if we wanted a table or to sit at the bar. I glanced to the left and realized sitting at the bar gave us full view of the ladies making sushi and other Asian dishes, so naturally I wanted to sit there.   Now, I had a friend with me and we had spent 3 hours in the early afternoon, next door at the Holsteins bar eating apps and drinking way too much. Alas, I was hungry again and he was not, so this review is for my meal and drinks only.  I started with the Margarita flight and was not disappointed! It includes a Salt Air Margarita, Pomegranate Margarita, and Ron Cooper Margarita. They were all delish. Started with the Ron Cooper, as it has mezcal, and being the whiskey/scotch girl that I am, I fond this smoky,  spicy rimmed rita absolutely intoxicating. It was perfect. The other two were perfection, as well. Had I not already drank so much at Holsteins, I would've ordered a full sized Ron Cooper. Mmmm  My friend ordered a single Rou Jia Mo Street Sandwich (Asian, red braised pork). It was small, but flavorful and perfect for him, as he was still stuffed from all our food and drinks earlier that day. I went with the $55 Chefs Experience tasting menu. O.M.G...  Every selection was heaven in my mouth. Started with chips and the best guacamole I've ever has in the US! I'm from Texas and have super high expectations for guac and this was excellent! Next, I was served a delicious Carnitas taco. It should've been double wrapped with 2 corns tortillas, instead of one, as it fell apart easily but the flavor was on point. Next came a single, delicious Siu Mai, topped with edible gold leaf. It was my favorite dim sum. Ever! Then came a scrumptious, large bowl of vegetable fried rice, that I had to share. The texture of the perfectly crisp veggies with the expertly cooked rice was exceptional!   To top it off, I was served 2 desserts that were over the top tasty. First came a churro that I devoured in about 5 seconds! Then, a mango, cream and rice krispie topped selection that was a prefect, light ending to the experience!   Our bartender/waiter was a tremendous asset and knew the menu and expertly explained what I was being served and provided excellent service,  as did the food runner that brought each selection. It was an AMAZING night and unforgettable meal!",

Tacos are SMALL and overpriced (actually the whole menu is overpriced, but that's in line with being on the strip).  All the menu items we got were overall kind of greasy.  I felt like we ordered quite a bit, but left somewhat hungry. For those eating here, I would recommend the Conchinita Taco, Traditional Siu Mai, and the Twenty Vegetable Fried Rice.",

    "text": "Underwhelming would be my singular descriptive word for my experience. That was my surprise here.  I'd heard good things about this place and decided to make a reservation to meet a friend for dinner. There were 2 hostesses that clearly had very poor communication skills. While waiting to be seated, the one hostess with whom I'd checked in per my reservation completely misdirected another pair that took our table. Mind you they had no reservation. Strike one. After being seated, we placed a drink order. I asked for ginger ale and my friend ordered a martini. What they brought me was ginger BEER (I'm not a drinker). The waitress apologized and made a joke about she herself being a lush. Strike 2. My friend made a joke about how she'd probably just drink the beer herself. I think he was right. When I asked about a particular entree I'd heard about she told me thet no longer served it and it was too bad because it was \"really good!\". Strike 3. I have to ask, why the HELL would a server describe something (which isn't available) as \"really good\"? Also, why would she not recommend something else? Complete fail. At the end of the meal, I had to ask for a water refill and our server came over with an order pad and stood for a minute. Apparently she'd heard \"order please?\" instead of \"more water please?\". Strike 4? I really do think she drank that beer. Given the atmosphere and prices, I anticipated a better dining experience. No second chances or recommendations from me.",

BUT ... and this is a freaking ginormous BUT ... the prices for what you get at China Poblano are downright ridiculous. Although above average on taste and presentation, the foods themselves do not merit the prices they charge.  $12 for 4 \"When Pigs Fly\" which are basically roast pork buns. The dough is very light and the filling is tasteful. BUT it is SPARSE. There was barely any actual filling in the bun. Ludicrous.  A typical roast pork bun costs $1.50 at a Chinese bakery on Spring Mountain and it is FILLED with roast pork.  Go. Go yourself and see. It is like a FREAK show. The most freakishly priced DIM SUM you have every seen. Then go to a normal Chinese restaurant and get five times the amount of food for the same amount of money.",

They have a separate menu that lists all the dishes that can be made without certain allergens (gluten, dairy, nuts, eggs, fish, etc.) - it was great that we were able to find lots of dairy and gluten free dishes without having to ask a bunch of questions.   The food is served tapas style (each person needs to order 2-3 things) - we all shared and it was fun to be able to try lots of different things. The food was delicious - we especially like the steak with mole, the fresh peashoots salad with sesame dressing, the Chinese greenbeans, the barbeque pork buns, and the margarita with salt foam.",

I've listed the good and the meh:  The good: +My husband and I were initially drawn in by the beautiful set up and ambiance of this place +Unique concept of Mexican and Chinese food in one restaurant +Great variety in the menu +Tried the duck tongue (\"Silenco\" taco) and it was very tasty and memorable, meat was tender  The meh: -Servers did not make eye contact when serving and communicating with us.  I felt a general feeling that the person serving us just did not want to be there.  Enthusiasm was very low -Prices are way too high for what you get, value is low -Ordered the lobster taco, meat was dry, pieces of shell was in the meat, hardly chewable and edible ($10 a lobster taco) -One tortilla is not enough to support the contents of the tacos they serve.  Filling of taco would fall through.  I'm under the impression that they don't have the logical sense to place 2 tortillas to support the contents of the taco or that they are very stingy on not using 2 tortillas.  Either way...not good, it defeats the purpose of eating a taco when the contents fall right through the tortilla -Left feeling like I didn't get enough to eat and I'm a 110 pound women (it shouldn't take a lot)  If asked the choice to come back, I probably wouldn't.  Would I recommend?:  If you are very hungry, no.  For a snack, yes.",

    "text": "I was a little apprehensive about trying this place because of the mixed reviews and the prices...   We deliberated for a little while, but decided to try with the knowledge that 1) This is not really a fusion place and 2) We probably weren't going to be full.  The place is decorated really cute and fun and the service is very friendly and attentive. I ordered the wild mushroom taco, the 20-vegetable fried rice, and the Open Sesame cold noodles. My companions ordered the lotus chips, Lengua taco, some kind of taco with oyster, and Pozole Rojo.  That wild mushroom taco was so delicious!!!! I have never had anything like it. Priced at $5.50, it is rather expensive for a teeny tiny taco but I LOVED it and that makes it totally worth it. I thought that the noodles and fried rice were also pricey, but really good and surprisingly filling. Try counting 20 vegetables in the fried rice... try it! J really enjoyed the pozole. I'm sure he wished it came in a larger portion too. The lotus chips were thin and crispy, not greasy at all.  So in conclusion, it's no lie that this place is super expensive. However, I still think it is worth the splurge because in the end, if the food and dining experience can exceed my expectations, then I am glad that I tried it. Trust me, I have paid close to the same dollar amount for sub-par food and service.",

Dumplings- very good 5. 20 vegetable fried rice- omg it's a must try and add beef or chicken for more deliciousness.   So these 5 items are plenty for two people.

I have my staples that I order every time such as the Viva Chinna taco which includes crispy beef tendon and lightly poached oysters. Delicious. The carnitas are very tender and flavorful, and served with a salsa cruda and pork rind on top. This visit my fiancee and I tried the steamed pork buns and quail egg shu mai for the first time, and both were immediate favorites! The buns were filled with sweet and slightly spiced barbecue pork, perhaps a little too sweet, but the toothy chewy dough made a great balance. The shu mai is something I will order again and recommend heavily.. there was delicious and delicate minced filling in a tender dumpling with a just very slightly steamed quail egg nestled right in the top of each one. It made for one epic mouth experience, salty and creamy with an appealing texture. The agua fresca was a perfect compliment.",

    "text": "Going on level of sheer genius applied to this amazing concept alone, with perhaps a bit of star-struck super chef power snuck in also, I would hands down give this place 5 stars. However, even megastars like Jose Andres gotta be rooted somewhere in the real world, therefore A-OK.  Service: affectionate and easygoing, if not slightly awkward and inefficient. Generally when I spill a boatload of water as I pour it from pitcher to customer glass, I like to wipe it up -- but hey, that's just me.  Cocktails: my girls Megs and Les, they don't shy away from the good ol' flammable stuff. I opted for the Lychee Sour, which was perfection, but Les didn't particularly care for her Singapore Sling, which I also liked, so we switched. Megs got the Lemon Drop Noodles and while the novelty of a gastronomy-inspired \"noodle\" inside an alcoholic beverage was always there, the satisfaction with the drink itself was not. Slightly too sweet and therefore too concentrated.  My Mexican half: Chips and salsa -- can't go wrong. Especially if you like the smokiness and texture of a fresh homemade chipotle salsa, start out with this. Just beware -- doesn't come with a whole lot of chips. Queso fundido -- melted cheese, baked in a traditional clay bowl, with rajas strips placed on top. Delicious, surely not for the faint of anti-cheese heart. Coctel de camarones -- the best part of the Mexican cuisine IMO. Perfectly seasoned with gigantic pieces of shrimp, avocado, and crab. Delightful, but pricey. Fried fish taco -- fried to perfection and topped with a complementary green chile salsa. Divine. Don't forget that squeeze of lime it seriously needs though. Carnitas taco -- comes with chicharrones. How can you go wrong? My girl Les doesn't do onions and it came with a generous topping of 'em. Buyer beware. (BTW: Extra tortillas, while deliciously fresh and piping hot off being handmade about ten steps away, cost $4. Buyer REALLY beware!!!)  My Chinese half: Har gau -- the promise of shrimp and pork belly is, without a doubt, irresistible to most. This comes out awesomely fresh and still appealing to many a dim sum lover, but... salt much? Ten treasures (?) -- this is SOUP noodles, not regular fried/dry noodles. with ham, shrimp, fresh veggies, enoki mushrooms and noodles. I loved it, but again, couldn't deal without our side of soy sauce. Salt much? Siu bao (or whatever they call it here) -- the meat is absolutely delicious and the bread is kneaded to a perfect consistency. But seriously........ it's called salt.  The bottom line: China Poblano is gorgeous -- a well-thought-out, neatly decorated space that no doubt will attract a ridiculously large clientele due in part to its being in the newest hotspot in Vegas, but also in part to its well-known celebrity chef backing. Personally, being part Chinese and practically 'raised' Mexican, I do appreciate this sort of \"fusion status.\" However, it's a simple matter of seasoning and salt in most cases, and for how much we paid, I'm not sure it should come down to that. Would I come back? Sure. Would I make sure to order a side of soy sauce and get my extra napkins ahead of time? Absolutely.",

Apparently they had been having problems with the system and it takes that much out but puts it back in your account in 3-5 days. Honestly I wouldn't recommend this to anyone unless your taste buds are equivalent to enjoying bland food.",

    "text": "We chose this restaurant for lunch randomly. When you walk in, you think it's chinese food, but then when we looked at the menu, it was more like mexican food. We ordered chips & salsa to start off. The salsa is good. Not amazing but it's good. They give you a huge wire bucket thing of chips and a spoonful of salsa in a mini bowl. We had to ask for more salsa 5890325783 times. Good service though. All employees were very friendly. We ending up deciding on just getting their small tacos. Husband ordered carnitas tacos 3 of them and loved them. They were pretty small and $5.50 each. Yikes.  I ordered 2 Viva China tacos which were beef, oysters, scallions. They were pretty good, but if you are picky about textures of food, these tacos were kind of \"slimy\".",

The tanginess and these crunch lil things which I suspect is fried roe makes the dish! The tacos were blah and bland and most dissapointing of all was some wheat noodles with tiger sauce. We thought the sauce sounded exciting and exotic but it was just chinese fermented bean sauce. This sauce does nothing to boost the flavor of the horribly bland wheat noodles. Totally disappointing and I will not be back!.",

This Is NOT a fusion restaurant. The menu clearly has Chinese dishes OR Mexican dishes.  Yes it tapas so you will get smaller portions.  If you have done any research  on this place you will know it is a Jose Andres establishment.  This is his style in all ways possible.  My favorite dish is the lengua taco.  So tender and flavorful.  My husband likes the when pigs fly.  I have never had a disappointing dish from here.  The lamb pot stickers are another go to along with the lucky 6 Shu Mai.  Go with friends so you can taste more dishes (hence with the tapas style).  The 20 vegetable fried rice was amazing the second time we ordered it.  The first time seemed to lack flavor but that second time packed a punch SO GOOD!!!!  Give this place a try and you will not be disappointed.",

    "text": "Overall, a really good meal. They have a separate vegetarian menu that includes the Chef's Vegetarian Experience - a tasting menu.  We both got that and the flavours and presentation were excellent.  Service was good and attentive.  We also had their signature salt air margarita, which was fantastic.  It is a hand crafted margarita with salted foam, served up.  The reason for the missing 5th star is a mis-step on serving two of us who ordered the same tasting menu.  For 4 of the 8 items, they only brought one item for us to share.  We later found out that we were supposed to get individual portions.  While the portions were adequate, we ended up paying full price ($45 each) for only 75% of the food we were supposed to get.  It was also awkward to share some of the dishes.    They were not plated to share.  the server apologized at the end, but did not offer any discount, which would have gone a long way toward the 5th star.  As far as the food, it was really good. The flavour profiles were fantastic, and it was well prepared and presented.  It is not, however, Chinese/Mexican fusion.  The dishes were either Chinese-themed, or Mexican-themed.  The restaurant touts itself as fusion cuisine venue, but it is actually simply a restaurant that serves versions of both.  This has been noted in other reviews and I went in with an open mind that maybe the reviewers had missed some nuance that would indicate fusion, but no, they are all correct.  I highly recommend this place, but a word of advice - if more than one person gets the tasting menu, clearly specify to the server that each person needs individual servings.  Otherwise you will get cheated out of food.",

We had a member of our group that is allergic to: gluten, dairy, soy, pineapple, and tree nuts. He brought her out her own menu which made ordering a breeze, and was extremely knowledgeable and took a lot of care to ensure that we didn't have to break out the Epi-pen.  We started with the tableside guacamole. Expensive? Yes. Worth it? YES. Some of the best guacamole I've ever ever had. This is a MUST have!! The manager made this for us.!  I ordered the \"Swallow a Cloud\" soup .The broth was just okay - semi bland. I asked our fabulous waiter for a side of spicy sauce which he brought out promptly. I appreciated that it seemed like a paired sauce, not just sriracha. The wontons are the STAR of this soup. Packed with flavor and delicious!!!   I also ordered a chicken tinga taco with was mixed with chorizo. Really good and the waiter brought me a habanero salsa to go with it since he figured I like spicy. He figured right.    All in all, we'd definitely return. The water wait was the only rough part of the whole thing, but otherwise, this place is excellent with allergy awareness/menu.

    "text": "Stumbled upon China Poblano when wandering the Cosmo for some lunch.  Had no idea what to expect, nor had I heard of it before.  Seeing that it was from Jose Andres I decided to give it a try.  Design of the restaurant is great, with an open air Chinese kitchen on one side and a Mexican kitchen on the other.  The dishes weren't really fusion, but rather you could get Mexican dishes or Chinese dishes.  Had a few tacos, the Carnitas and the Cochinita.  Both were tasty, but liked the Cochinita the best...the pork has a wonderful braised flavor.  Sticking with the Mexican side of the menu, I had a Salt Air Margarita to go with the tacos.  Nothing overly special about it, other than the sea salt foam which takes the place of your traditional salted rim.  If you got a sip of too much foam vs liquid it was rather salty...but tasted good together.  On the Chinese part of the menu, we tried the Pork/Crab Xiao Long Bao and the Dan Dan Mian noodles.  Big fan of XLB and like to try it when I see it on the menu.  Typically go to Din Tai Fung here in the LA/Orange County area when I have a Xiao Long Bao craving.  I must say, the XLB here really impressed me...gives Din Tai Fung a run for their money!  Sometimes at some places the \"soup\" portion of the dumpling is lacking...not the case here.  Very juicy and flavorful...and steamed perfectly.  The Dan Dan Mian noodles were very tasty and cooked perfectly as well.  Server was helpful and friendly, overall a great place.  Did not find it as expensive as some people are complaining about in reviews.  Its Vegas...it was right in line with what I would expect.",

We finally decided to try it, and upon entering, the atmosphere is loud but cozy. The menu is small, but hard to order from. Portion sizes are inconsistent across the menu. Some items are for sharing, some not.   18 monk noodle dish was really salty, to the point we couldn't finish it. The noodles were hand cut, cooked al dente (saving grace). A shame the salty flavors overwhelmed the whole dish.   Notable item was shockingly the swallow a cloud (wonton  soup +$2 for noodles). Didn't have high hopes for this, but it tasted the closest to the authentic thing, albeit still a bit salty.   Service was fine. Food came out a little slow for a weekday dinner, but they did have a pretty packed house.   I'm kind of disappointed after so much anticipation. The flavors are a little too heavy for our taste.",

I've been wanting to try this place for a while now, but seeing as it is surrounded by amazing restaurants it got pushed to the bottom of my list for a while. After exhausting the other options in the Cosmo, it was China Poblano's time to shine. Unfortunately it did not.   Everything was either over seasoned to the point where it assaulted my tastebuds and I couldn't taste much else other than salt or it was bland.   The Golden Pigs dim sum are fried and filled with BBQ pork, served with a side of sweetened condensed milk. Sounds okay at a glance, especially since it was recommended, but after tasting it, all you could taste was SWEET. It tasted like a fried dessert dipped in icing, and the pork was completely masked by everything else. Disappointing. The Tuna Ceviche was so salty it was like eating ocean water, which is not something I really want from ANY meal. The same goes for the Queso Fundido. Really unfortunate. The only thing I enjoyed were the corn tortillas served with the Queso. The were fluffy and delicious. Other than that... not much else impressed me.   If it wasn't surrounded by a plethora of amazing options, I might say give it a chance... but that isn't the case. Don't bother with this one.",

We basically tried most of their items on the menu. Trying their pretty but expensive dimsums, yeah it's definitely Instagram worthy since it's all colorful and stuff but can't beat the original quality of run down Chinatown carts in nyc. Noodles, tacos, everything we tried had a south american hint to it which was great and different. It was worth trying. Service is excellent and the venue is pretty hip and trendy.",

    "text": "When you see the name \"Jose Andres\" attached to anything, you're going to expect an amazing experience from food to the service. The China Poblano wasn't my first choice but hey, I was along for the ride and I'll certainly l keep an open mind. China Poblano is located on the second floor inside the Cosmopolitan hotel. It's an Asian/Mexican place, NOT a fusion place so you aren't going to find carne asada noodles or teriyaki chicken burritos or anything like that.  We were greeted by the front and had a short wait to be seated. Once you're inside the walls have masks all over them and there are red lights and bicycle wheels hanging on the ceiling. Pretty wild. The bench seating didn't look like much but it was pretty comfortable.  For apps we ordered the guacamole and chips & salsa. The salsa is fire roasted with a bit of heat and tasted great. The guacamole is prepared table side and was absolutely phenomenal. Creamy with a touch of onion and cilantro. It was by far to me the highlight of the meal. I ordered the chilaquiles with a sunny side egg on top and man, this was a pan full of disappointment. I'm not going to beat around the bush, the \"tomatillo salsa\" they used tasted like a slightly weaker version of the canned Las Palma Green Chile enchilada sauce I use at home. Part of it was maybe because I ate too many chips and salsa with the guac but I finished probably half my plate. On the other hand, my friends enjoyed their tacos and Dan Dan noodles so I guess I got the short end of the stick on this one.  Service though, was excellent. From the waiter, to the water guy, to the guy who took our plates they were all great and had me add an extra star. That said, chances of me coming back to China Poblano are slim. There are far too many options in Vegas to check out and even a mediocre meal sticks out. Again, I'll point out that everyone in my party enjoyed their meals so maybe you'll enjoy yours here. Just don't get the chilaquiles.",

My expectation was I would just be getting street tacos and dim sum. We sat down and our group ordered the chef's taste sampler. It's expensive and portions are pretty small. The food ranges from flavorful street tacos presented very nicely, to salads and rice salads. The food was unbelievably good. So much unique flavor that I had never experienced. The perfect fusion of Mexican and Chinese food. We left our meal very satisfied and our tab wasn't too bad in price. To sum it up, I would say I was pleasantly surprised and the meal was worth every dollar.",

    "text": "Tried China Poblano last night for the first time. Very very disappointed with the service. The hostess was very sweet but our interaction with our waiter was almost nonexistent. We ordered the Har Gow, 2 tacos, chips and salsa and the La Vida drink and the old fashioned. Our waiter mumbled an okay when we ordered and ran away. The tacos were okay, the Har Gow was good but we never got our chips and salsa. And never once did our waiter check on us while we were eating...we had to eat our Har Gow with a fork because he never came around to offer chopsticks.  Still hungry, we decided if he came by the table we would order the scallop shumai and another drink, the Ma. We were able to order our second round without much wait however, when the drink arrived he placed it on the table and scurried away again...didn't ask if everything was okay or update us on our shumai order.  30 mins we sat looking around and twiddling our thumbs with no update on our second order. I swear he forgot to put it in but then saw us just sitting around because 45 mins later our food appeared. Granted, there was some sort of group event that was about to start and everyone was running around getting ready for but, we were paying customers too.  Who I assume to be the manager, a young man in a burgundy suit looked panicked and like he didn't know how to handle the large party plus a busy dining room.  He should remind his staff to check on all tables. When it came time to pay we had to find our waiter, make eye contact and yell \"can we have our check\".....because he never came to check on us.  The drinks were interesting, the Ma specifically was delicious. But the ambiance and service was subpar.",

Cocktails are interesting not normal ones you see.  I appreciate the table side guacamole. I have a tomato allergy so it was nice to eat delicious guacamole without tomatoes or pick de gallo in it.  Shrimp taco the sauce was a little all over the place and over powered the taste of the shrimp. The covered fries were ok. They were ordinary fries topped with cheese and sauces. The best dish was the brusslesprouts.  Had higher expectation but I would still recommend it. Hopefully you all will enjoy.",

Traffic was horrific, it took us 7 hours to get in, but we were so happy that we were just barely going to make our reservation. When we got there, we were told the restaurant closed early because it was a slow night.  There was a system error and they did not get our reservation on Open Table.  Greg, the manager at Jaleo, came out to talk to us and make things right.  He went above and beyond, walked us downstairs to China Poblano to see if this sister restaurant was closed/ and or could take us.  The restaurant had already closed, but Eduardo (China Pablabo's manager, John, their sous chef, and Joseway our fabulous waiter, were all willing to accommodate us.  They kept their kitchen open, asked if we had any food allergies, then told us they would bring out their top dishes for us.  The spread they sent out was out of this world!  Such a unique concept Chinese and Mexican food fusion.  It was like nothing I had ever had.  Both my husband and I were saying we likely wouldn't have booked the restaurant at first glance, but are so happy fait brought us to China Poblano.  We were blown away with how amazing their service was, how friendly, how accommodating every single person was, the flavors of the food, and the cocktails.  I have NEVER been treated like this anywhere.  It was truly an experience and we will definitely be back again and again. You will not be disappointed by eating here.",

I'm a picky eater, I have high demands for everything, and I usually need to self-season and tweak most dishes, but not here...everything from the tortillas to the beans and garnish were delicious and perfectly flavored, no need for even salt or pepper.   Order anything you want, heck even order with your eyes closed, and it will be good. Nice staff, cool ambience, not too loud or obnoxious, and you will probably see a celebrity or two walking around.  If you want something different while visiting the area, try this place...much better than the typical boring steak and potatoes you see all over vegas. Thumbs way up!",

    "text": "Upon entering this welcome dojo of culinary flair I was welcomed by the GM on the floor as he could sense my haste. I was sat directly at the high top bar on the right of the entrance front and center(ish). I enjoy sitting here as you get to feel the heat from the center burners and watch your meal being prepared (depending on what you order).  You also have front row seats to how they prepare their fresh guacamole. It's a lot of fresh avocados and a whole lot of smashing / whisking. I usually order tacos as they fire quick and the flavor profiles are robust. This trip I ordered two Silencio (duck tongue with lychee) and one Viva China (beef tendon with an oyster). The flavors of the duck tongue and lychee compliment each other quick nicely and leave me craving more. The beef tendon has a very intricate prep where each bite you take (3 should be norm) you are left with thin crispy salty crunch bombs that are mixed with the oyster's natural sea water flavor.  Overall extremely umami and it's hard for me to order anything else when I come back....and I will.",

    "text": "We had a very enjoyable experience here. The service was outstanding and the food was delicious. Admittedly, though, we did not venture into any dishes on the China side of the menu. We opted to sit at the taco bar, which was kinda nice.   For cocktails, we had the Salt Air Margarita and Mexican Mimosa. With the Mexican Mimosa, we ordered the first one with papaya juice (good, but a little boring) and the second one with guava juice (amazing). The Salt Air Margarita was particularly exceptional. Such a great and innovative way to do a margarita - and it definitely tasted far better than your typical margarita.  We started off with the queso fundido. The fresh tortillas were fantastic, but the queso itself was a bit of a let down. While it was good (and we certainly ate all of it), it didn't have a lot of flavor to it. Basically, we were expecting more.  We then shared two sets of two tacos - the barbacoa and Viva China. The barbacoa were incredibly delicious! So many great flavors, and just the right amounts of juiciness and crunch. The Viva China were interesting, but were quite salty. And the two Viva China tacos actually tasted different - one meatier and saltier, and one crispier and less salty. A good and interesting flavor experience, but we probably wouldn't order them again.  For dessert we ordered the flan. It was unlike any flan we have experienced before. It was served with ice cream and these awesome seared-like pineapple squares. All the flavors together (flan, ice cream, and pineapple) were absolutely incredible! And it was all even better when paired with the guava Mexican Mimosa. One of the best desserts we've had in a long time.  It was a little pricey (especially $6 for a bottle of Coke), but everything we had was delicious (so it was worth it). And the service was exceptional. Our server was very attentive and knew the menu well. One of the better service experiences we've had in awhile. And the space and decor is neat. Overall, great casual dining experience.",

My friends ordered dishes and I decided against it because it all looked like overpriced Mexican food. I am Hispanic and my mom would blow these people out of the water. One of the dishes in particular was the Dan Dan mian. We asked the server how big the portion was and she said it was a normal entree size, it was not it was more of an appetizer and enough for maybe 4 bites of food. The sauce on the noodles tasted like \"mole\" from a glass jar that is tasteless and can be bought at any supermarket. It was a sad attempt at mixed cuisine. They might have better things on the menu but if the server suggested this as their best item then I suggest going to an authentic Chinese restaurant and if you're looking for Mexican go to an different place as well.",

I had their signature salt \"air\" margarita. It's not really air, but salty foam that floats on top of your drink. Not only is it super cool and inventive, but it gives you a hint of salt in every sip. Delicious!  Even though Jose Andres, the Spanish chef behind China Poblano, is world renowned, I was curious to see how he'd do Mexican food. I grew up eating Mexican food and am very picky. All my cynicism was gone as soon as I read the menu. The queso fundido, a melted cheese appetizer served by nearly every Mexican restaurant, is made with queso Menonita. Most of you have probably never heard about it, but that's what queso fundido is SUPPOSED to be made with (not Monterey cheese most restaurant use.) To know Chef Andres has it imported from Mexico is really special.   All the food we tried was great, especially the tuna ceviche. The one thing we had that was kind of blah were the tacos. That's why I'm not giving it five stars. You can find way better tacos in nearly every taco shop at a fraction of the price. Even the $10 lobster taco ($10 for one, little taco) was just okay. Nevertheless, I can't wait to go back again for margaritas and queso!",

Yes, this place is definitely pricey. Newsflash to everyone: EVERYTHING is overpriced in Vegas and if you don't want to spend money, stay home.   My rating is based on service, selection and quality of food -not price.    We ordered \"Cold Tea for Two\" that combined the flavors of green tea, tequila, and beer; this was very refreshing and interestingly delicious.  The green tea in it made me feel less guilty about drinking alcohol so early in the day.   Then we ordered their guacamole served with handmade tortillas -this guac is just like my mom's with generous slices of jalapenos! Best thing about the guac is that they make it to order from this huge mountain of avocados and you can choose how spicy to make it. The Guac was a meal in itself -but I felt like a vegetarian pig and ordered more.    The vegetable spring rolls were delicious and our waiter was so attentive about my needs that he let me know that the sauce had fish in it and made an alternative soy sauce to dip them into.  I ended up dipping them into that guacamole and felt like I was eating Asian taquitos...   Then came the \"Setas\" taco made with wild mushrooms on top of MORE GUAC! -supper yummy! My carnivore boyfriend ordered the \"Rou Ji Mo Street Sandwich\" that looked more like a \"gordita\" with carnitas.  He said it was very tasty.   Yes, there's more... We decided to try their \"Tres Lychees\" dessert that took the concept of a traditional \"Tres Leches\" Mexican cake and added lychees in three different forms: Lychee Ice Cream, Lychee whip cream, and fresh Lychees on top. Perfection!  I will definitely return...",

But be warned this is a trendy \"small plate\" big price restaurant which means both your wallet and your stomach could be left empty. However, the food is delicious, the atmosphere fun and the service impeccable, if a bit pretentious (each food runner describes the dish you just ordered as they deliver it to your table in case you are so drunk on their incredible tequila offerings that you need reminding).   China Poblano offers both Mexican and Chinese dishes side by side, hence the name.  I was hoping for more of a fusion concept but dove in with all tastebuds firing.   Number one: Get the carnitas taco.  At $5.50 it is moist, flavorful and meaty!  Yes there should be at least 2 if not 3 tacos for that price but trust me, ignore the price and just order a lot of these!   The guacamole and warm tortillas are delicious and filling.  The quail egg shumai are great and you get 6 of them in one order.  The pozole is good and satisfying, not the best I've had but good.  The dan dan noodles were earthy tasting and not my favorite although the actual noodles were wonderful, the topping tasted of pungent, ground earth, maybe not bad, but not my taste.  For dessert, we ordered the churros with Oaxacan chocolate.  This was off.  The churros were flavorless and not sweet enough although the texture was right.  The chocolate was bad.  The flavor was mingled with an unrecognizable savory, spice that we didn't care for at all.    Had a fabulous 1.5 oz. pour of tequila.  Their tequila menu is extensive and organized by Highland and Lowland brands.  Also their take on the classic margarita is really fun with a salty foam topping that is delicious for those who enjoy a salted margarita.    The prices are ridiculous which is why I am not giving the place 5 stars. But it's the new Vegas and long gone are the crappy $1.99 buffets about which I am certainly not complaining.  However, it seems we've moved to the opposite end of the spectrum, serving higher quality food while gouging people with prices 4 times the actual cost of the ingredients.  I hope in my lifetime, we see a happy balance between the two.  But if you're willing to blithely open your pocketbook, you're in for a great meal!",

The Carnita Tacos were probably the best I've ever had. Kinda expensive but well worth it. $5.50 each. The noodle dish that we had wasn't great but not bad either. I will definitely come back and try other creative dishes!",

We ordered the Queso Fundido (yum), Dancing Eggplant (beautiful presentation, so tangy and lively though they kind of went overboard on the bonito flakes), 20 Vegetable Fried Rice (delicious) and Dan Dan Mian noodles (this was absolutely outstanding; spicy pork and peanut sauce, fresh delectable noodles).   We had water to drink and our bill for the two of us was $55, but we left full.  The service is okay. Not overly friendly and two waiters stood by our table and talked about how hard they work and what money they made through almost the entire meal.",

I'm not Paris Hilton, but paying $50 for less than 750 calories is ridiculous.   Otherwise the food was tasty given that we had no expectations of Jose Andres.",

My sister really wanted Chinese food and this place was the closest thing to it. I expect food in Vegas to be expensive bc that's just how things are here. However, the food is expensive but great!  This was not the case here. We ordered a $15 guacamole dip which was mediocre. We were advise that the portions were small plates and to get a few to try. I ordered the dan dan mien bc I wanted a noodle dish. The description said that it was wheat noodles with spicy sauce. It came out with regular rice noodles (ones they use for pho) with some dark sauce on it that look like black bean sauce. It tasted awful. It was so blah for a restaurant in Vegas to serve. The portion was very small and it was not worth the $14. I sent it back and a friend of mine who ordered the same thing sent hers back too.  Also two of my other girls sent back the mole fries and the tuna ceviche. The street tacos were very mediocre for $5 each. I wouldn't recommend this place for the foodies out there! Your better off going to mcds!",

    "text": "My wife and I dined here on Christmas Eve with another couple. The restaurant was maybe two-thirds full and we were happy to be sat at our table 20 minutes prior to the start of our 7:00pm reservation. Our drink and food orders were taken promptly and all was going well until we received the bill.   This was at 7:30pm.  Our waiter assured us that it was no problem to split the checks per couple. We obliged and he said he would return with a check for each couple. The checks he dropped were wrong and we asked for them to be corrected. In addition, I reminded him that I had comp points on my Cosmopolitan players card that I would like to be used. I even wrote it on the itemized receipt as a reminder.   He returned with the correct checks and took our credit cards as well as my Players Card, came back to our table with the cards swiped and I notice he hadn't used my comp points. He took my check again and applied the comp points.  We leave the restaurant at 8:25pm.  It took us longer to pay our bill than it did for us order and eat our food. We could not have been more disappointed with our experience. To make matters worse our waiter did not even acknowledge the fact that he took 55 minutes to cash us out.   As a Vegas local it always amazes me that, in a town that prides itself on the Hospitality industry, that we would find such terrible customer service.   My wife and I will not be back. The food was alright, but the lack of attention to detail by our server ruined our dining experience.",

It was sooo worth it! I love everything about China Poblano, the ambience, the staff, and of course, the food. I am so sick of fusion places, so this was a breath of fresh air. They managed to bring together two  unique cuisines under one roof, and they did it in a very elegant way.  Our server was very attentive and very knowledgable of their menu, he gave the best recommendations and checked-in on us regularly. I was quite impressed at how each dish was explained to us as they were being served.  As for the food, we ordered the pork belly tacos, chicken wings, 21 vegetable fried rice and golden pork buns with condensed milk. Each was a winner, but my friend and I both agreed that the golden pork buns were little pieces of heaven. I would drive back to Vegas anytime if it means I could have this dish again.  Overall, do not pass up on China Poblano, it's one of the most memorable meals I've had for this whole weekend!",

All persons who checked up on us were very friendly. As each dish came out, and the dishes were set, the server explained what it was in detail which was very nice.   Ambiance: 5/5 Music was going and it had a bit of a mix. The only thing that threw me off was a Shakira soundtrack...must've been chefs choice. The alternating photos of both cultures was a nice touch.   Food: 2/5 The 21 vegetable fried rice was a bit tasteless and had a bit too much oil. Portion was okay. We did have knowledge it was small plates, but $19 for a one person serving? People in china and Mexico don't eat small plates. I asked if the fried rice came in half size, thank god it didn't.  Vegan tacos were actually pretty good, but the price for one taco I believe scared people away. No matter how fresh ingredients are, price points are what bring most people back...$4.50 for one yummy taco. I'll give that taco 4/5.   Overall: 4/5 I can say I probably won't be back here again. I wasn't satisfied with the portions, however some flavors were present. I had to pass on dessert and head over to whole foods to get a pretty wicked vegan whoopie pie!  If you have a pretty fat bank account, by all means check it out. But if yours is tone and skinny like me, probably not worth checking out!   Enjoy!",

I don't mind taking out a home loan to eat good if what I'm shoving in my face is the epitome of greatness (if you took that seriously, you really have to reevaluate what's up stairs) but China Poblano is FAR from that! Skimpy portions, less-than-stellar food with eh, OK service.  I really, really, really wanted this idea to work so I kept ordering more but the further I dove, the further they drowned!  -When Pigs Fly (steamed BBQ pork buns) were OK but nothing special especially when a $1.99 dim sum item is inflated to $11.88... Even the local gourmet Food Truck in SF charges half the price but produces better quality.  -Sui Mai yielded the same result as the buns however at an increased cost of $12.88  -Pozole Rojo was a good sized soup however they skimped on the pork and overloaded on the hominy.  Base was a little too limey and chicharron on the side was STALE! UNACCEPTABLE!!!  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog?select=_Vigtw5o5yH1xxrLqiJvug\">yelp.com/biz_photos/GJ_b...</a>  +Carnitas tacos were really good, no complaints (surprising?)  My homie had the Mongolian Beef with rice but everything was so unsatisfyingly small in portion size that we ended up going back upstairs to our suite and ordered room service.  China Poblano isn't disgusting, the food just isn't anything memorable and for what you get, the prices are absurd (please don't give me that \"quality vs. quantity\" argument \"foodies\" because I've had better quality in higher quantities throughout Cali).  I can't see China Poblano surviving for too long and I'm willing to BET on THAT! Haha",

The golden pigs were recommended by the waiter but the pork filling was literally flavorless; just a sort of gelled consistency surrounded by a fried dough that when dipped in the sweetened condensed milk ultimately tasted like a donut. The lengua taco was ok, but not really a lot of flavor. My husband and I envisioned going there and enjoying a variety of small flavorful dishes but given the price and our experience with the taco and golden pigs, we stopped and paid there. We only ate 2 of the 4 golden pigs and hoped our waiter would ask if we liked it, but he only asked \"can I get you anything else?\", so we just asked for the check. I'm so glad we started with just two items, and for the record we ordered them at the same time and hadn't been there for long, so I don't think we had annoyed the waiter. It's just sad that it wasn't delicious and I wouldn't recommend that anyone spend their money there.",

I mean, seriously, it was SO good. The service was Ok, maybe a touch on the slow side but nothing to complain about. The prices were decent considering they are in the Cosmopolitan. We also got the dragonfriuit salad, which was delicious. They were out of dragonfruit though. And for dessert, we got the sticky mango rice. Ho LEE shit! That was probably one of the best desserts I've ever had. EVER!  I would definitely come back.",

Portions were small, food was severely over priced and they served their sodas per bottle. The food quality wasn't good. The shining star was their salsa and chips. The salsa is great, but do yourself a favor and take it to go and pair it with food from somewhere else. The staff is moving your plates and grabbing plates to clear the table while your still eating, but the actual server who takes your order was MIA we had to ask someone to get him for us. It makes enjoying a dinner with your friends and family hard. Get the chips and salsa to go but don't stay and eat.",

The carnitas was WAY better. I believe that one is their best seller. We also shared the golden pigs. I was skeptical about eating a fried pork bun but it went really well with the condensed milk sauce. The other dish we tried was the dan dan mian. This dish was the most disappointing to me. The portion is pretty small, I didn't like the flavor and it was way too salty! We sat outside the restaurant and service was pretty good. They refilled water and kept checking on us and clearing plates. Not sure I would go back for the food though. Too pricey and not tasty enough when I feel like I can get better tacos and dim sum in Cali for way cheaper.",

    "text": "Everything is pretty small and served like tapas, but somehow its surprisingly filling.  There were definite highs and lows to this meal, but I think there were a few dishes that excelled while only a few weren't quite what we had hoped for.  There was a big group of us so I managed to sample quite a big portion of the menu.  Highlights:  Carnitas tacos-served with guac, pork rinds, and a verde sauce!  Like water for Chocolate- fried quail served with dragonfruit and edible flowers.    Chilaquilles- tortilla chips cooked in a pan with a salsa verde and cheese.  Kinda like nachos.  Mango \"sticky rice\"- this is something quite interesting.  The sticky rice part was made into a mousse and ripe mangoes.  I've never seen this before and it was really cool.  The \"rice\" element were like rice crispies on top.    Chocolate \"terrain\"- Awesome chocolate mold of a Chinese soldier with a spicy chocolate mousse inside.  It was served with cookie crumbs to look like sand, and a ginger ice cream that was spicy and sweet all at the same time.  Things to skip:  Oceans Nest- fried noodles served with stirfried saucy seafood and veggies.  We ate all the lobster out of it and then left it there.  It was super bland.  Lamb potstickers- pretty presentation with the little edible flowers and everything but it was bland and looked more exciting than it tasted.  Overall, I thought the place had a whimsy to it that I thought was fun.  The ambiance was interesting and diverting, the waitress and wait staff were helpful and went out of their way to see to our requests.  While some of the food is a bit overpriced and small, I really enjoyed their desserts, there is something light hearted and comical about them.  They were the highlight of the meal.  If nothing else, come and have dessert and a laugh all at the same time.",

    "text": "China Poblano. Asian and/or Mexican?Tomato Tomatoooo.  I was in Las Vegas for work recently. Vegas is not my favorite place. I'm not into seeing woman being pathetically objectified, losing money, or big flashing lights while I'm trying to catch my zzzzs.  That being said, the food in this town is outstanding! China Poblano was recommended to me by someone I met at a bar while in town. I had a friend accompany me on this dining adventure. And an adventure it was!  The restaurant is located in one of the fancier malls. Not the most elegant place, but colorful and cheery instead. The food is, as the waitress explained, \"both Chinese and Mexican, not fusion.\" Okay, interesting!  We started with drinks... the Salt Air Margharita. Hands down, this is the best cocktail I've ever had. It was foamy and lovely and lightly salted and oh my! may I have another?  Apparently, they have a to-go window. You can walk right up and grab one of these spectular drinks as you puruse the fancy shops.   Mexican cuisine was served first then the Chinese. Dish after dish. Different aromas, tastes. It was a trip around the world in my mouth. Heavenly!  I want to mention that the service was Incredible as well.   For the perfect night, pair dinner at China Poblano with an after-dinner drink at the Chandelier bar next door. Yep, order fancy cocktails and listen to live jazz while sitting inside the largest chandelier. Too cool!",

As far as the food goes, it was just alright. Although I admit that some of their food was creatively put together, it wasn't something I would go back for.  If you're looking for something similar, try Jaleo which is just upstairs. It's classified as fine dining and naturally more pricier, but the food is definitely worth it. The dishes are much more flavorful, more bolder, and more bang for the buck.",

The chips and salsa are not that great. The chips are fresh though, and the salsa has a smokey flavor to it.   I ordered the Silencio, the taco with duck tongue with lychee. It was a little on the salty side, but the flavors complimented each other. Definitely spicy!  Ordered When Pigs Fly, which was your basic bao (steamed pork bun). Nothing special really. Linda small to what I am personally used to back home.  The Dan Dan Moan noodle was noodles in a self-mix sauce noodle dish. It was alright. The sauce was kinda plain, noodles more doughy than expected. Not bad, worth a try.  Ordered the Ocean's Nest. Okay, it was Hong Kong style pan fried chow mein, with lobster. Still not impressed and definitely not worth $46.  The Empanada de Pollo con Mole Poblano was really good. The mole was complex, savory, rich, and authentic tasting. The outside was crispy, and the meaty filling was cooked just right.  For dessert, the Mango Sticky Rice was hyped up by our server. She described it as \"light and refreshing,\" which it totally was. The rice was actually toasted rice krispies sprinkled on too of a coconut creme whipped topping. The mango underneath was so sweet and delectable, very nice finish to the meal.   Overall, it was a great place to try. I personally like the Asian food back home. The Mexican food had a near modern twist, and the drinks were great and surprisingly strong. I give it 3 stars for food and price, it was expensive for what you get, but great service! Very attentive, sociable, and polite.",

I'm a fairly adventurous eater and my dinner companion can easily be fooled into trying anything if you tell her \"it tastes just like chicken\". We had an assortment of tacos (carnitas for her, beef tongue and pork belly for me) along with the shrimp dumplings (my friend had never tried any kind of dim sum so we figured, why not). Pretty good tacos, not sure what to think of the dumplings. The mango sticky rice was a little strange and not what you would expect but still kind of cool.  While this would not be my first choice for Mexican food or Chinese, it is a cool place to go to in Cosmo with fairly decent prices or with a big group (lots of things to share).",

    "text": "***Jose Andres' China Poblano in the Cosmopolitan Hotel scores a mediocre score of 3 stars on Yelp, but I found all of the food (I had two of their savory courses and 1 dessert) to be good to very good***  China Poblano features a mix of contemporary Mexican and Chinese dishes.  Some dishes are gussied up with contemporary cooking techniques or high end ingredients while other dishes veer more on the fusion side.    I started with one of their tacos--a carnitas one topped with guacamole, fresh lime and chicarrones.  I thought the fillings were great.  The carnitas was moist and tender.  It was also nicely seasoned.  It had a good flavor and wasn't too salty (which happens a lot with carnitas).  The guacamole was cool and refreshing and it was a great contrast to the warm and savory carnitas.  The chicarrones were crispy and light.  The soft corn tortilla was fine, but it wasn't a good vessel for the meat juices.  The only problem with the taco was that it was too wet.  I also has the twenty vegetable fried rice and it was very good.  The rice had a nice soy flavor, but it was not too salty.  The vegetables provided great contrasts in textures, but with that many vegetables, which were cut up into small pieces as well as paired with a flavorful rice, the individual flavors of the vegetables were (as expected) kind of lost.  Still, there were a lot of vegetables including fresh greens, crispy sweet potato, haricot verts, squash, turnips, carrots, asparagus, Brussels sprouts, and watermelon radish.  There were also proteins like soft tofu and scambled egg.  For dessert, I opted for their flan and it was very good.  The flan was incredibly smooth, creamy and light like a panna cotta.  It was topped with a great cajeta gelee (rich caramel flavor).  There was also cajeta ice cream (incredibly dense and a great rich caramel flavor).  The plate was garnished with good pineapple, which was not too tart.  Service by the bartender Victor was excellent; he was incredibly personal and helpful with the menu.  You could tell he really wanted all of his customers to have the best experience possible.  Prices are not too bad considering that it was Vegas.  The fried rice dish was under $20 and it was a very generous portion.  Some portion sizes seem small in a few dishes when considering the prices (like the tacos), but it is still a better value than the many overpriced Vegas restaurants serving just so-so food.  In terms of the decor at China Poblano, the bar gives you a view of the chefs making the dim sum.  There is a main dining room, but I wasn't a fan of the tables (they kind of looked like what you would find at a gourmet order-at-the-counter spot).  Overall, the decor was forgettable and not that great.  I thought the food at China Poblano was good.  The food was pricey, but Vegas food tends to be pricey and there are places in Vegas serving much more expensive food that is not nearly as tasty or refined as what you can get at China Poblano.  I think China Poblano is a good spot for an upscale lunch.  And since the same menu (with the same prices) is featured at dinner, it is a good spot for a nice dinner with a more casual approach and more reasonable prices than the many overpriced high-end dinner places in Las Vegas.  I believe the Cosmopolitan offers both complimentary valet and self parking.",

It's all one texture - SOFT - which means you can't even pick it up to eat it.  If the tortilla had been crispy it would have helped the filling stay inside, but as it was a soft corn tortilla, the over-soft beans and sour cream inside just wanted to squeeze out.  I had to just dump it on a plate and eat it with a fork.  Didn't particularly even enjoy it that way so took two bites and let my friend finish the rest.  The one really delicious thing is the mango sticky rice dessert.  It's not a traditional sticky rice but it's really good.  Overall, the only reason I keep going back is that my friend works for this restaurant group and he gets a discount.  If not for that reason, I would probably not eat here again.",

    "text": "So, I agree with several of the 3 stars here and I am leaning on probably a 3.5 for here but, I can't quite put a 4 down. This has been on my list to  eat visit for awhile because of its odd Asian/Mexican fusion which does not seem to make sense. The place itself is like an acid trip with videos on the walls, stadium seating at bar, and bike wheels on ceiling.  The place is all small portion and sort of a tapas with large meal prices.  My meal Dan Dan Mian Noodles $12- really good with great flavor, a great soba noodles and sauce. Chilaquiles $13- Which is basically tortilla chips, sour cream sauce, and a tomatillo type sauce. This is very close to a tradition version of this dish and it was good and rich. 20 vegetable fried rice $20- This was the best of them all, a great mix of veggies that I have eaten in such youthful form and great flavor.. However the size overall was probably 2 cups.  Desert- Mango rice $11- which was airy and very light with a cream rice flavor and cold mangos.  Drinks-Singapore Sling- Traditionally made and perfect! (where did these go America)  Salt Air Margariita- Crazy good with a salt flavored foam.  Overall a solid meal, however the bang for the buck is lacking. after tip this meal for 1 is over $90 and I can say I was not full in the end. So, the food is good but you are going to have to order 3 items per person to consider it a meal.",

I'm glad I walked in with low expectations because I was blown away by the great food and cool ambience!  We started with the lotus chips.  They were perfectly seasoned, sliced paper thin and then deep fried.  The had a great crunch and because they were so thin they just crumpled in your mouth.  It was a great start to the meal!  Next we ordered the 20 vegetable fried rice.  This was awesome!  Both my husband (who's half Chinese so he knows his Chinese food) and I agreed that it was one of our top fried rice experiences.  They used brown rice as well so it had a nutty, and grainy texture that was very pleasant.  The Chicken Ji Song (lettuce cups) was also delicious although a bit messy with the sauce dripping onto my hand with every bite.  Lastly, we tried the Chilaquiles which is one of my husband's favorite foods.  It was delicious with the melted cheese and green tomatillo sauce! The waiter told us all the dishes are small plates meant to share but I thought the portions were quite big (especially the fried rice and Chilaquiles).  The fried rice alone is enough for a meal for one person.  I loved this place and recommend everyone to give it a try!",

However, they were delicious! If you're not too hungry go that route. The salsa is a chipotle style so it was a nice contrast. They add a spice to the chips that rocks. The wontons are not crazy deep fried and they come with a nice sauce. I didn't eat the salad but my mate said it was the best he's had in awhile, I'll take his word for it.   It was a casual easy going experience and I definitely recommend trying it!",

At one point, one of us had our fork in the actual dish and someone came and tried to grab it. And I had food in my mouth and they kept asking me a bunch of questions. LIKE OMG LET ME ENJOY MY FOOD, HOLY JEEBUS!!!!!   The food was also mediocre at best, nothing to boast about...I mean I guess the wings were pretty good. But that was about it.  I think I would have enjoyed my experience here if it wasn't for the constant bombarding from the servers.

The Mongolian beef tasted like a few pieces of beef soaked in watered down soy sauce. The dish had a ton of old lettuce and really should have been called a salad.  The Twenty-vegetables fried rice was simply not good. Like some of the other reviews said it did not taste like fried rice. Adding chicken for the extra $5 was a mistake as it certainly did not make the meal taste better.   Lastly the handmade tacos looked great being made. We just tried the standard chicken tacos and it tasted like plain chicken with no seasoning.   The staff was nice here and pretty fast  Might be a good idea to keep walking past this one.",

    "text": "I live local to the DC area, so I've had a lot of Jose Andres' cooking in his various Washington restaurants-- some of my favorite places and food, although at all of them, meal+drinks at non-happy-hour prices will put a dent in your wallet.  I was curious to see how his Vegas efforts were doing, so checked this one out on a recent Vegas trip.  Even in a town full of esoteric and unusual design, it has an eye catching design and great decor.  The number of tables inside is limited, but there are 2 large bars, and various randomish seating outside.  It's pretty unique looking, bright colors.  There's a carryout window.  Service was over-attentive.  The female server thought the habanero salsa was far too hot to possibly have by itself (we found it hot but enjoyed it by itself)...  That salsa and chips were both very good.  A chinese-mexican fusion taco wasn't worth repeating.  A barbacoa taco was some of the best barbacoa I've had!  Drinks pricey but strong.  The GF had one with ground-mezcal-worm on the rim, I had one less exciting-- both great.  The prices are highish-- this is a fancy restaurant, it's Jose Andres, and it's on prime real estate.  A full dinner will set you back if you have much appetite at all.  Two tacos, a small steak entree, two drinks, and chips/salsa were about $75 after tip.  This is Vegas, and there is people-watching-- there's a fair amount of foot traffic from people staying at the Cosmopolitan.  If you're looking for American-Chinese food (you know, the crap they serve in altogether far too many suburban joints) or for Tex-Mex, this isn't the place.  For some top-shelf drinks and innovative cooking, you've come to the right place.  Just expect dinner to be expensive!",

There were so many tasty fresh veggies included, along with chicken, which I added for an up-charge.  My niece loved her entree, Ants on a Tree, while the guys at the table loved the Dim Sum item, When Pigs Fly.  The service was top notch, friendly and attentive.  The price was a little high for the portion sizes, but considering the location, we were pleased overall with our dining experience.    This restaurant is located inside the Cosmopolitan Hotel & Casino on the Las Vegas Strip.  Getting there and parking can be difficult if you live locally, but for visitors, it's easy.  Parking for locals is underground of the building but there is a fee for parking and if a concert or event has let out recently, getting out of the parking garage will have a wait.",

We wanted something quick, but good and they delivered. I ordered the Carnitas taco and the Brisket taco. They are the street taco size but very tasty. Lisa ordered the traditional dim sum dish and loved it! The food is great, service is quick and the prices are reasonable for Vegas. We plan to go back.",

    "text": "Well, I eventually had to leave the restaurant because I was too upset to enjoy what is usually my favorite meal. If you're reading thing you won't believe this, ha, but I'm not an overly dramatic person and can usually focus on the positive and get past being upset (how 1st world to not be enjoying an expensive meal because the hostesses weren't very respectful), but when I found even the food didn't taste good because of my mood, I had to pack up and leave.   Long story slightly longer, I walked over to Julian Serrano's Tapas at the Aria and remembered why I'm an MLife Platinum member. I was: promptly greeted by the hostess, immediately sat, quickly offered a menu and a drink, and while walking back from the restroom, was kindly greeted by a waiter who recognized me and thanked me for coming back (despite me frequenting this restaurant maybe a third as often as China Poblano). Do I expect people to know me? No, of course not, I'm one of many, many regulars, and I get that. But the 180 degree difference in experience may have just sealed my preference. I think the food at China Poblano is better, but that's pointless if the flavors are soured by a terrible experience.",

What I Ordered:   *20 Vegetable Fried Rice was flavorful. I enjoyed the variety of veggies Must TRY  *Taco De Camaron yummy *Table Side Guacamole was an excellent choice the bowl is much larger than the photos portray. *Tuna Ceviche was my absolute favorite item.   *Air Salted Margarita was delicious. I usually pass on the salted rim and was excited not to see it! The foam on top gave just the right amount of salt needed! Well crafted cocktail!   I'll be back for some Dim Sum & thank you Miller our server for being knowledgeable!!!",

We went there last night in a whim, there was a 30 minute wait for BAR seats, so whatever we walked around until they called us. The host seated us without a smile. The bartender took a few minutes to even look our way, and was rude and inattentive the WHOLE time. Didn't give us any recommendations, didn't ask how our food was, and barely acknowledged our existence the whole time - I've never had such an experience at any bar!   Then the food came - the tamal was soft and mushy (I'm from SoCal, and tamales there are about a quarter of the price and way more delicious). The wok stir fried green beans were bland and had exactly 1 piece of \"fresh\" baby corn (bad description/advertising on the menu). The twenty vegetable rice with chicken was a joke - I had to add a ton of soy sauce and hot sauce just to make it edible - we found only 1 piece of tiny chopped chicken, no egg, and the vegetables were mostly raw. Ugh!   These guys have no idea how to make food, how to be nice to guests, or how to make them feel better. We mentioned on our way out that the experience was less then and were made to wait until the manager came out and he did nothing! Just kept saying that other people like the food - lol not helpful! Needless to say, I won't ever be going back! And you've been given a heads up too - if you want to eat tiny mediocre food for big $$$ and rude service, then go for it!!  Ps - we left hungry after 3 dishes between 2 people, so we found the secret pizza place and grabbed a slice - so much more fulfilling!!",

I say that in the best way possible. It's really sweet and we actually saw a dude next to us send his back for that reason, but we really liked it.  Har gao was super flavorful. The ceviche was very acidic, but really refreshing and tasty.  The tacos were... Not great. We both had the same criticism - super under seasoned. The fish taco was screaming for some lime juice too!   For dessert, we shared the mango and \"sticky rice\". It was a different take on the dish, but really tasty.  All in all - a fun vibe, and *almost* all of the food we got was excellent. Maybe it was an off day, but I'd say skip the tacos.",

I like the options of being able to chose between asian or hispanic dishes and the fact that they make their dumplings and tortillas in house, but there just wasn't anything that really wowed me.  The location is across from Block 16 Food Hall on the second floor of the Cosmo. The inside is well decorated and has a casual feel to it. There's two open areas in the front where various cooks prepare dumplings and tortillas. There's also some bar seating available.   As for food we tried a variety of things. The table side guacamole was good, but nothing special or unique. The Mojo Shrimp was probably my favorite thing. The shrimp was juicy and the sauce was tasty. I wish the portion size had been slightly bigger though. The dessert, Churros, was somewhat disappointing. They didn't taste super fresh and the \"hot chocolate\" was way to thin to actually utilize to dip.   I feel like I'd come back again if they were to revamp the menu a bit, but I wouldn't go out of my way to make any recommendations to friends. It's just an average restaurant on the strip.",

Since we had never been and didn't know what to try we asked the hostess to recommend some non-veg dishes, as well as vegetarian dishes. She recommended 2 different noodle dishes to try.

The bright neon \"Chinese Food\" and \"Mexican Food\" signs caught our eye. On a Thursday evening, we were sat right away. The restaurant is designed beautifully, and it's quite big. There are famous faces of Chinese leaders like Mao, and artists like Frida Kahlo, plus luchador masks all around the walls.   Our server was very informative and let us know that each dish is tapas style. I got the Salt Margarita created by Jose Andres (it's his restaurant). The pomegranate margarita comes with a mountain of salt foam, so drink as little foam as possible with each sip. My BF absolutely loved the Flaca margarita, so he ordered 2.   We split Scallops Siu Mai (shumai), Silencio and Pescado Estilo Baja Tacos, and the Gan Pung Ji Chicken Wings. We were sadly very unimpressed by the food. The chicken wings had zero flavor and were grilled. The siu mai I enjoyed, but not blown away. The tacos were good, but again, nothing mind-blowing. For a place so beautiful with renowned chef tied to its name, its disappointing.",

Our server was nice and explained the concept of the restaurant and the dishes to us.   The food was alright, I wasn't as impressed as I was hoping to be. I didn't really see the fusion of Chinese and Mexican in our dishes. The dishes that we got were strictly Chinese or Mexican, so didn't see the fusion in it...?   -The ahi tuna ceviche was very good!  -har gow- Cantonese dumplings were good.  -Ants climbing tree which is a glass noddles dish with bok choy, chicken, roasted sesame seeds was just a big mushy lump and not much chicken or bok choy, wouldn't recommend it!  The concept and idea of the restaurant is nice but not too sure that you see in the dishes presented.",

It looked way too exciting not to try so we made a reservation as we didn't want to take a chance.  We were seated shortly after we arrived.  Our server was attentive and friendly.  We started with a margarita and table side guacamole.  I don't usually drink margaritas because I find them too sweet.  This one was very good and the guacamole was amazing.  I had the blue corn quesadilla for my entree.  It was very good.  I would have liked for our stay to be longer so that I could dine here more.  There were so many interesting dishes on the menu.  I guess they will have to wait until our next visit.",

Their sui mai are perfection - I ordered the Lucky 6 this weekend and ate them all without sharing. My boyfriend ordered tacos, & we shared the wings; the glaze on the wings is sweet, spicy, sticky, light, and perfect. Sooo good.   I always order a margarita, this time the \"Salt Air\" one, and it was fantastic - love having the salty taste in foam form with each sip rather than actual granuals of salt in my mouth. LOVE this spot.  Didn't get the chocolate terra cotta warrior dessert this time, but it's magical as well. Keep it up!",

I wish I could buy a jar of that to take home. Kind of a weird concept to mix Mexican/Chinese food together. It could be a personal preference because I don't really like Korean tacos either (cheese added with asian flavors seems a bizarre to me)  We had the Swallow a Cloud soup which was okay. The dumplings were amazing, but the soup was super bland. I would've loved to try the dan dan mien but they were out. This was during early dinner time on a Sunday so that was very disappointing. Based on this experience, I probably would only order take out just for the dan dan mien.",

The guacamole is made tableside and is delicious.  The serving size is plenty for a table to share.  However, the $16 price is a little high.  The salsa is possibly the best salsa I have ever tasted and was reasonably priced at under $5.  It has a sweet tomato flavor with a small kick.  The chips are light and have a great crunch.  All of the other dishes we ordered were just average.  They included the palmitos, young coconut ceviche, silencio taco, taco nopales y queso, pozole rojo, and beijing glass noodles.  Our bill for three people was over $170, which included only one beverage.    Our server rarely came to check on our table and the service was slow.  I had to request water on three occasions.  I enjoyed the salsa and guacamole, but feel the restaurant is a typical overpriced Las Vegas strip establishment.     ALL-STAR DISH: chips and salsa (seriously).",

The food was good for the most part. The seating arrangements were not what we expected. They have long tables with benches where they can seat numerous parties at once. I'm not a fan of the seating arrangement because it's difficult for my back. The decor was interesting and it started up many conversations.",

As I was walking through Cosmopolitan, I didn't really pay much attention to this little Asian-Mexican joint because it looked like an unappetizing fast food spot, BUT what did catch my eye was Jose Andres' name plastered in front of the restaurant.  I've fallen in love with Jose Andres ever since my enjoyable experience at The Bazzar so I just had to try it.  Of course I knew it wasn't going to be the same, but this just wasn't even good... for any type of standard.  I wanted to try an item from both sides so I opted for the lobster taco and their dan dan mian noodles.  The lobster taco was about $10 and the noodles were around $16?  Both were extremely overpriced for what I got and I honestly don't mind forking out the cash for good food, but this did not even come close.  The portions were extremely small for both, not to mention that my lobster taco was soggy.  The dan dan mian noodles were supposed to be one of their more popular items and I can tell you that there are about a million places in 626 that do it better for about $6.  I regret coming here and should've just gone to Secret Pizza.  China Poblano, how dare you taint Jose Andres' reputation like that!!",

Everywhere I looked it was style over substance, women trolling for a golden ticket, men trying way too hard to look pensive in staged photographs, popped collars for miles....and absolutely no sign of that furball that creates the one-thing entourage of my daughter's deadbeat boyfriend.  Let's face it, that beast has no sense of style.  Chewie's idea of suiting up is picking the birds that got trapped in his fur out of his natty ass backhair.  Fortunately for me, black is always in, so I had no trouble getting into China Poblano - which, on its surface, presents the awesome combination of Mexican and Chinese food all in one place.  Why has nobody in the entire galaxy thought of this before?  I will say this:  What we got was absolutely delicious.  I will also say this:  There really, REALLY should have been more of it.  Look, I get that part of being one of the \"beautiful people\" is only pretending to eat your food, so I'm sure for the regulars of that hotel, the 2 bite meals are more than sufficient.  Let's face it, though:  Nobody would ever claim that I needed to eat a damn sammich.  And if I'm going to pay 20 dollars for a damn 20 vegetable fried rice, it should be substantial enough to where I have more than 1 little bit of each kind of vegetable.  12 dollars for an object I could eat in one bite?  Jesus Christ, even the WATER was small.  No, seriously, tiny glasses, and they never even completely filled them on refills.  What the hell is it with this kind of philosophy?  Made me want to go out and Force Choke a kitten....or at least the beloved Marie Osmond.  But my quarrel was with this restaurant, not the Flamingo Hilton.  Sorry, but you're claiming a combination of Mexican and Chinese cuisine, both of which historically consist of larger portion sizes.  So why try to integrate tapas style sizes with steakhouse-like prices?  Maybe the owner should focus more on balancing the value of his cuisine instead of kowtowing to perpetually pouty-lipped 20-something gold miners looking for someone with enough mastery of The Force to use Jedi Mind tricks on the Jimmy Choo salespeople for free shoes.  My recommendation?  The recipe for the SUPERB 20 veg fried rice is readily available online...I almost never say this, but make it on your own spaceship and save yourself the expense.  3 Deathstars.",

I understand a restaurant has to make a certain amount of money for each plate, but this place was exceptionally over priced.  Tacos were good, pork buns were tasty, and the chips and salsa were ok.  Unless you're bent on going here, try another place. Quality to price ratio is out of wack.",

    "text": "I have seriously been trying to eat here for years, but there is always a really long wait without a reservation...and of course, I was never smart enough to make a reservation.  The girls and I needed a quick dinner and it was rather early, so I was hoping there would be no wait.  Luckily, I was right.  When we first sat down, the bus boy brought us water immediately, but then no one came over to us for what seemed like 20 minutes.  We eventually had to flag a waiter down, who was very apologetic and proceeded to provide the best service ever!  Not only was our server very attentive, so was the rest of the staff.  Even the hostess came by at one point to check on us, which I found rather strange but funny, all at the same time lol.    We started with the fried lotus chips with mole sauce.  Just an FYI: the fried lotus chips do not come with mole sauce.  The waiter offered it to us for making us wait, I believe, and I sure am glad he did.  The fried lotus chips are good, but a bit plain.  However with the mole sauce, it was delicious!  One of the girls ordered the pozole rojo, which was good, but it was nothing compared to the caldo tlalpeno the other girl ordered.  The caldo tlalpeno was so flavorful that it was hard to believe that it was only soup.  Here's a warning: if you cannot take spice, then the caldo tlalpeno is definitely not for you.  Sorry, sucker lol.  I ordered one each of the lengua taco and the barbarcoa taco, which were both delightful.  Lastly, we shared one order of the diver scallops and green beans in XO sauce.  I love scallops, green beans, and XO sauce...however this was a tad salty.  It was mostly the XO sauce so I made due by not getting too much sauce in each bite, which worked out nicely.    Finally, to make up for forgetting about us, the waiter brought out a complimentary dessert, mango and sticky rice.  I love this dessert anyway so I was pretty excited when he brought it out, but of course it had a twist to it.  Normally, it doesn't come with whipped cream on top, but this one did with what seemed like crispy rice treats inside.  Anyway, I don't normally eat whipped cream since it's so fattening, but I figured hey, I'm on vacation...live a little!  And man, am I glad I did!  Yum!",

    "text": "Chinese and Mexican under one roof? Weird, right?  WRONG.  So good!  They recommend that you order 2-3 plates for each person and share.  So, almost like Chinese tapas... with a Mexican flair. Choices are available from dim sum, noodles, tacos, soups, etc.  We ordered some of the more traditional choices, like shu mai and tacos (both chicken and barbacoa), which were very good.  But the best were the off the beaten path items... the rainbow congee (soup with sausage, carrots, and snow peas) was delicious.  It seemed like it had polenta or some similar base, and the flavors complemented each other with the added crunch of the veggies.  By far, the wen rou salad was the best! Tofu and avocado were blended with a delicious citrus based sauce which was phenomenal.  I see so many of the reviews talk of how expensive this place is.  OK, but it is the Cosmopolitan!! Hello! This place is one of the more reasonable in the hotel (even the buffet is $29 per person) and we were really glad to have eaten here instead.  We had two dishes each and we were not hungry at all.  I would definitely go back.  The flavors were amazing!",

Some notes:  -The atmosphere was fun (decor is amazing!) -Service was great -Food was creative and delicious -A few dishes were a miss (a noodle soup with the word \"ugly\" in the name), but most were spot on.  -Mexican food was slightly better than the Chinese, but that makes sense given Jose's backgound.  -The salt-air margaritas are genius.",

    "text": "Carnitas taco, barbacoa taco, beef siu mai, Chinese wings, Mongolian beef  Definitely a neat concept. The space is really cool, you can see them making the tacos and noodles from the outside.  We made a reservation which was the right call since the place was pretty full. The waiter recommended ordering a few dishes to share, so that's the route we went. We ordered, tacos, siu mai, wings, mongolian beef, and the queso fundido (basically make your own quesadilla). The food comes out as its ready, so it's kind of fun waiting to see what comes next.  The item was the tacos and I have to say the barbacoa taco is easily in my Top 3 Tacos of All Time. Absolutely amazing. I regret not ordering more them. We also got the carnitas which was good but can't be compared to the barbacoa.  After that came the beef siu mai which I thought tasted a little off. The rest of my party did not finish it either. Luckily the asian wings and mongolian beef arrived quickly after that. I really liked the wings, but the mongolian beef could have been from any corner Chinese shop.  And that was it. Oh wait, what about the queso fundido. It still hadn't come 20 minutes after the previous dish. We asked our waiter about it and it had either never been reported to the kitchen or they lost the ticket. Either way it came out right away after we asked, but they were not apologetic at all. The queso itself was alright, although definitely not worth the wait.  Overall I'd say the food is most just good, but you can do so much better (with much better service) at too many places on the strip to make this a must-visit.",

The menu is really too big and takes time to go over.

And once you order be ready, they start bring food out fast! You even be through a taco before they want to take your plate and give you the next item. They also say us by a busses station so we had bus boys next to us the entire meal cleaning dishes. Gross.",

So yes, small portion...but wowww is it tasty.    Also went with the salt and air margarita, which my bartender creatively added a touch of hibiscus tequila to it.  I give her props too, because she could give a Tequila lesson to anyone who could listen. The salt \"air\" was a cloud of ecstasy.  Yum.  So yeah... a little expensive but unique dishes.",

We've never had any dishes off of the Chinese side of the menu- so no comment there, but the Mexican food is amazing. (And husband is Mexican so he would know).

I have no clue why so many reviews say bad service  Also, if you have an allergy, like at all the Jose Andres restaurants, they have a special menu for you! I recommend trying something Mexican and something Chinese. The Dan Dan Mian is not spicy (tastes like Korean Barbecue) but amazingly delicious. The Beijing Glass is fresh and a lighter, healthy fare. The swordfish ceviche is to die for, as well as the Oaxacan BBQ Taco (the cactus tastes like a more earthy and mild version of a pickle).",

    "text": "The notion of intermingling Chinese and Mexican cuisine is intriguing and exciting, and when I saw China Poblano on Yelp it seemed ideal for a late afternoon lunch. Any excuse to walk to the beautiful Cosmopolitan is actually motivation enough for me. Unfortunately, though, the restaurant ended up being an expensive, huge let down.   My initial impressions of the interior were pleasing. The space is flavored by festive reds and other vibrant colors, exuding a playful ambiance. As I continued to make my way inside, the lack of ventilation become apparent -- extremely warm. Peeling off my sweater was a quick fix, though. After sitting down, you notice that the walls are graced by rotating projected images of Mao Tse Tung, and random images of Chinese peasant girls, little boys, and Mexican adults. It was strange.  After being seated, we were shortly met by our waiter who inquired whether or not we wanted chips and salsa. Without hesitation I said \"Yes, please!\". The chips were served warm in a small basket and were, admittedly, quite good. The accompanying chipotle salsa was also tasty. What I didn't realize was that the chips and salsa were $4, not complimentary as this San Diegan is accustomed to. The couple next to us had an attractive bowl of guacamole that they were noshing on. I wanted the same and requested it. Loved the flavor, but wouldn't have ordered it had I known it was $15! We quickly ran out of the small portion of chips and requested some more to have with our remaining guacamole. An additional $2 for the chips. It was my fault for not carefully reading the menu, but, seriously, I would have never expected chips and guacamole to cost $21!!! Who would?  We ordered margaritas. $13 each. Glass was very small. Do they put tequila in their margaritas? Tasted as if I was drinking straight lime juice. Gross.    Finally, we ordered a dim sum item, the Sui Mai, a 6-piece dumpling dish ($14). Dumplings were very small and too salty for my liking. This is an item that would probably cost no more than $4 at a typical dim sum restaurant.   After the parade of disappointments, we decided to cut our losses and treat China Poblano as an appetizer spot and move on elsewhere for dinner. Unfortunately, it was an expensive appetizer experience:  Around $70+ with tip. Overall, this restaurant just didn't live up to my expectations at all. Way overpriced for the portions you get, even by Vegas standards, in opinion.",

I enjoyed the decor and the idea of Chinese Mexican fusion, but there are actually 2 kitchens that each serve their respective cuisine. I ordered the Mojo Shrimp which cost $18. This includes 8 pieces of shrimp in sauce, and nothing else. I understand they serve tapas here, but with such a high cost, you don't want to order 2 dishes/person. My friends ordered the dumplings and soup. The dumplings were also a small portion, but looked good and were less costly. The soup was probably the smartest purchase as it was a large serving and it was the same price as the Mojo Shrimp. The food tasted good, but there are tastier/less expensive options.",

If you want mini, yummy, meals....and money is no object....this is the place. I recommend you try the salty foam Margaritas.  Again, yummy, and tiny.",

It just felt weird.  What was weirder was the table side guacamole.  We've all seen this a million times over.  However, I've never experienced my server making it.  This seems not sanitary to me.  Isn't our server touching the menus, dealing with $ and credit cards?  Then she's mixing up the guacamole? I don't know it just didn't feel right.  Overall the food is decent and the tacos were good.  I would do this spot if you are staying at the cosmopolitan and needed a quick lunch.  When I say quick I mean it cuz those seats are unbearable and you will want to get out fast.  I couldn't stay for another drink because I was so uncomfortable.  Were there multiple people during the design of this restaurant that collectively said \"yes let's go with the blocks of wood 1 foot off the floor for the seating.\"",

They're clearly branding themselves as not being a fusion restaurant, but a restaurant that serves Mexican and Chinese dishes, of which the flavors compliment each other. It's not your typical sit down restaurant and that's fine with me. We had duck tongue tacos, carnitas tacos, fried rice, dan dan noodles, and some pork pot stickers. The pot stickers were very juicy inside and crispy outside, but the flavor was nothing special. Everything else was exceptional. Also ask for the hot sauce. It was a nice touch.",

They allowed one person in our party to order individually due to dietary restrictions. The tasting menu is $55 and well worth it. A well paced meal starting with the gold fleck dumplings. The 2nd course was a guacamole stuffed jicama cup. The hearts of Palm salad was spicy and tasty. I honestly can't remember everything but we had duck in steamed bun taco wrapper, noodles, veggie rice, carnitas tacos,shrimp, pork stuffed wontons with sesame paste, buns with a codensed milk dipping sauce, and we ended with churros and a mango rice pudding. Excellent value and delicious. I highly suggest the salt air margarita. It was my favorite off the margarita flight. Service was average and a noisy stimulating environment. I would suggest this place to anyone with a mildly adventurous food palette .",

The best of the dishes were on the Mexican side of the menu...all the different tacos are average to above average.  Noodles - you automatically want to try the hand pulled noodles right away because theres always fresh noodles being pulled by the chef in the front of the restaurant. However, the dan dan noodles we tried was soggy, no texture and over cooked. ARgh, what a disappointment.  Buns - tasted like it was reheated from the frozen varieties.  Is it too harsh to say the next best thing to order was the Mexican Coke !!?!",

The salsa wasn't your average Mexican restaurant/Ralph's salsa either. The lettuce wraps were tasty but they only gave four of them.  I'd be nice to have six. For desert we had the Mango Sticky Rice whose name is misleading because it's basically a Rice Krispie desert with whip cream (coconut cream I think). Our waitress gave a good description for the Chocolate Tera Cotta Warrior dessert. Will probably get that the next time we're here. Great service and decor.",

    "text": "First, let me tell you what this place is NOT.  It's not cheap, although not terribly pricey by Vegas standards. If you want a cheap fast meal, I would recommend grabbing a couple slices at the Pizzaria upstairs.  It's not really Fusion, since most of the dishes are clearly either Mexican or Chinese, with only a couple that successfully fuse the two.  It's also not a fine dining experience you would expect at some of Jose Andres' other restaurants.   However, we did enjoy excellent service and very tasty and often creative food. The server was very knowledgable about the menu and seemed enthusiastic about the food. Service was very attentive and the manager even stopped by to make sure everything was good.   They have two nice open kitchens where you can see homemade dim sum made next to handmade tortillas. We mostly tried the Chinese dishes, since we have plenty of good Mexican in LA. The lamb potstickers are juicy, delicious, and beautifully presented.  The 20 vegetable fried rice is probably the best fried rice I have ever had. We also tried the chilaquilles, which were delicious and filling. The tacos seemed pricey at $5 a piece, but we didn't try any. The mango sticky rice was very light and refreshing, but don't expect any actual sticky rice.  Try the \"tea for two\" for an interesting cocktail. Overall, it was a very good dining experience although not necessarily the best value.",

I wish I could duplicate the sauce.  Big bowl, definitely feeds 2 as a main dish, 3-4 as a side.  My husband had the Red Braised Pork Street Sandwich ($8) and he said it was very good.  Pricey though for a very small sandwich.  Still, the quality is outstanding and I'd rather eat less and pay more for great food.  Bench style seating on community tables is hard on the back (no back rests); very sleek modern style - interesting ever changing graphics projected on the walls.  I'd go back for the Veg Fried Rice and would like to try their other food.  Great quality!",

Definitely just order from the Mexican side of menu as the Chinese we ordered was bland and barely touched.   One good thing- the service. Everyone was friendly and willing to accommodate our semi-drunken table. Oh Vegas..  I would TOTALLY recommend Holstein's next door over China-Poblano if you are standing there conflicted between the two.",

Our server took forever to take a drink order. Our food order. Forgot about certain questions we needed answers to. And just down right looked like she didn't give a crap about her job. No personality... Not even a smile from this girl.   She came over only once to see if our food was ok. And not to the entire table either... She came up behind one end of the table and asked with a low voice if we needed anything. Any other time.. We had to stop her from avoiding us to call her over.   Didn't seem like she was busy either. I watched her the entire time. No rush. No pep. The only table she bothered to table touch was the party of 2 in front of us!  The basic job requirement: drink refills, wasn't even done! I purposely waited to see if she would come by and offer me another iced tea. (Because I had a water to get me by) Not once. That cup had bare ice all throughout my meal.   To management: We stiffed Kimberly on a $340 tab... because she didn't deserve the tip that was suggested. She's lucky she got anything at all. I'll tell you who did earn it though, and did get it. Manuela. The bus woman who made sure we had extra small plates. Brought us limes/lemons. Refilled our drinks. Asked how we were doing on more than one occasion. You know. Things our SERVER should have been doing. Things that an ex-server like myself will notice and be annoyed. Annoyed that employees nowadays show no pride in their work.   To everyone else: there are way better restaurants in this town to go to. With better food.",

First dish was basically tortilla chips/nachos with cheese, peppers and chorizo. Tasted delicious. I also had a couple tacos. Not the hard crispy things you get in the UK but almost like savoury pancakes. Nice and juicy. I had one with pork and another one with a fish. However, I think they may have been some confusion as one taco came late and it tasted like pork - and not any sort of fish I  have had before.",

    "text": "This is definitely a go to spot when I'm in Vegas and if you're in town you should give it a try but that being said I would lean more toward the Mexican side of the menu (not because I'm half Mexican either) and less on the Chinese side. So for the record I love Chinese food...I do live in Alhambra...one of LA County's Asian food Meccas.  I was hearing about how bomb China Poblano's tacos were and I was like \"ahhh tacos are tacos\"... right?   NO...not so much. The first time I ordered we ordered Lobster, Carnitas and Chicken tacos. Each taco has it's flavorful meat lay on a freshly made warm tasty corn tortilla. Also, a bit of fresh in house made salsas that are loaded with flavor and not so heavy on spice and some fresh cilantro are added.  I have to say each and every taco I tasted was fantastic.   However, the stand out star of the show in my humble little opinion is the Carnitas Taco, it is a very succulent braised baby pork meat... but it is topped off with an in house made small fried pork rind. Can I say that after I had that little added crunch in my taco...I thought to myself \"why in the hell didn't I think of that\". If you've had chips in your sandwich you know what I'm talking about. This extra little crunch make it pop and sets it apart from all other tacos. Ohhh...yum! The freshly made guacamole is so so good, perfectly made and even there chips are very very good and there just chips!  In addition to ordering the tacos the first time we ordered some Chinese food too. I love veggies ...very big on vegetables and among my favorite is eggplant. Naturally I ordered the Dancing Eggplant from menu and the Lemon Pepper Shrimp dish. The shrimp was a little to spicy for me personally but it was fine, nothing to write home about but not bad.   The only item that went array was the eggplant. I don't understand how anyone could go wrong with eggplant...it is so meaty and absorbs flavor when cooking it like no other veggie. Not only was this the worse eggplant dish I've ever tasted it was the worst tasting food I've ever eaten period! I think it must have been steamed and it was if someone sucked all the flavor and life out of it...nasty. Sorry CP it was bad. Hence the 4 stars instead of 5. However, as horrible as that dish was everything else I've had and every time I've eaten there I enjoy it.   By the way you can dine in or order take out...and eat it in your room. Oh and it is on the pricey side for tapas style food...but hey it's Vegas :) . Enjoy!",

Ok, I understand, you pay for the name. Jose Andres is a brilliant chef. The idea of mixing Mexican food and Chinese food is ingenious.   The food was good, the service was great. the Rou Jia Mo Street Sandwich with red braised pork was super delicious. The When Pigs Fly were Bao buns filled with pork. Although they were good, I have had better for way cheaper in Chinatown. We had a Barbacoa de Res taco and Pancita al Pastor taco. Both were good but keep in mind you are paying $5 for one small sized \"street taco.\"  I m still rating it 4 stars because the atmosphere was fun and the service was great. The servers really take the time to explain the menu. If I go back, I would like to try one of the many \"smoking\" drinks I saw getting passed around.   Great concept but do not expect street food prices.",

The service was very friendly and knowledgeable but really really slow. It was a Sunday night, and busy, but it was no excuse to take more than 10 minutes to get our first cocktails.  The cocktails are so fun! Go for some of the margaritas and specialty drinks. We also had a flight of excellent tequilas. If you like tequila, this is the place to go.  We were trying to eat light before our concert so my husband and I each opted for one taco. He got the duck tongue taco and I got the oyster +lychee taco combination. Both tacos were excellent. Very interesting flavor combinations.   Following our tacos we got a plate of the lamb wontons. They were delicately folded and full of lamb goodness. Beautifully presented!  Lastly, we shared an epic churro dessert. The churros were worth it. Each one was crispy, fluffy and best dipped in the Mexican hot chocolate sauce.   This is a great place to come for some interesting small plates, good atmosphere...but don't be in a hurry to get out!",

It's a brilliant idea (you taste the salt with every sip instead of having to lick the salt from the rim off the glass) and is well executed.  Some of my favorites: the mushroom taco is the best vegetarian taco I've ever had; the brussel sprouts are divine and dressed in a scrumptious salsa verde; and it's hard to put your fork down with the tuna ceviche and shrimp mojo on your table.  Unlike some other celebrity chefs, Jose Andres somehow manages to maintain the utmost quality at his restaurants (it's no surprise that so many of his executive chefs have gone onto have their own success).",

It was pretty empty when we visited (around 3 pm) and we sat down at the bar where we got to watch some of the staff preparing tortillas. The prices were definitely Strip-worthy, so as budget conscious people, we only picked 3 items.  Chips and salsa - for $4, it was a decent choice, and the salsa was indeed yummy.  Coctel de Camarones - on the pricey side for it's size ($15), though very nicely presented. We were disappointed that it did not come with chips (it IS similar to ceviche) but we made do with the chips from the appetizer (which apparently, weren't refillable). It was very delicious; however, we weren't a big fan.  They had specials on the menu (which oddly enough, was only written on one of the two menus we received and isn't on the website menu) and our server suggested we try one of them. Not a big fan either - it was a meat tortilla sandwich on top of a sauce (which made the tortilla itself soggy), and the flavors were nothing spectacular.  Service was great however, and pretty fast. I'd try this place again, but I may stick to the China side of the menu (that said, I may just go to Chinatown instead).",

Twenty bucks for rice, vegetables and egg fried up?! Come on now that's just insulting.  Next, the baked pork buns were without a doubt the worst pork bao I've ever had. Try Noodles next door at the Belagio and you'll find the pork buns you're looking for. We couldn't even finish them. The insides were tasteless and the outside was a chewy mess. Oh, and they don't have spicy mustard for them and want to charge an extra $2 for some chili oil, explaining that it's made in house. We're talking about pretty standard condiments here.  We also got some tacos, the best thing I could say about them is that they were mediocre, and so was the service. We had to send 3 people back to finally get some soy sauce and never saw our waiter again after taking our order.",

Some of the flavors were good, but the portions were small. I ordered the lobster taco, which only had two small chunks of lobster. The tacos are tiny. My taco was only two small bites. $10 for that? My friends also ordered tacos, and were extremely dissatisfied. We were so unhappy that we asked for the tacos to be taken off our bill (which they did).   The service was super slow.   I would not come here again. It was a poor choice my birthday dinner.

The hostess at the entrance was nice and got us seated right away. Our server Theron, was on point on providing special recommendations. The food is definitely an acquired taste. Don't come in thinking that the food found here is what you'll find in some fast food because it's not anything found in fast food places. The food here definitely has a fusion kick being that the food is definitely in the fancier side, than normal.   The plates are on the smaller side, so the idea of this restaurant is more tapas and family style. The idea is to order multiple dishes that you can share with amongst everyone on the table. All in all after ordering 5 dishes with 3 alcoholic beverages of bill was just about less than $100.   Would I recommend it for friends to try? Let's just say I'm not rushing to tell my friends about this foodie experience. Customer service is great, but I think the food is too fancy for me, when all that I want after day drinking is a greasy taco or bowl of shrimp fried rice.",

This being our first visit, I researched their menu before we reserved a table and already knew what we'd order before arriving. The problem was that they took our order and then did not bring out everything or even check on us. These are small, tapas like dishes so one would think once a dish has been eaten, the next would arrive at the table. Instead, a busboy arrived to take our dishes away like the meal was over. I understand making room by removing empty dishes in the middle of a meal but these folks appeared to think we were done and I needed to remind them I still was waiting for a carnitas taco and their shrimp mojo. When the waitress finally returned and I explained we did not receive every dish ordered, she looked at her scribbles on her pad, said oh yes, you have another taco coming but also said I never ordered the shrimp dish. I told her ok and please bring my check. I really wanted to love this place but with service this sketchy, not sure I'll be back.",

I understand the concept of this place being that you all order small dishes to share within the group.  The waitress explained that normally you need about 2-3 dishes per person to fill you up. Keep in mind each of these small dishes are about 5-25 dollars.  With a large party, this place is not worth it for you.  Our waiting asked if we would like to have some chips and salsa for the table. We said sure so they brought out two sets since we had 7 people. Then she goes, I can bring out some guacamole if you guys would like as well. We said, sure. So they brought out two bowls  I was really craving tacos but noticed it was 5.50-10.50 for one. I asked her how big the tacos were and she said 2-3 bites worth. Sorry, I don't care how good this taco was... It's not worth that price. I can get a better tasting taco in east la from a taco truck.   Their \"famous\" fried rice didn't wow me either. Tasted like something I could get at any regular Chinese place.   When we got out check with a grand total of 171 dollars we were pretty confused since we only order a taco each and some fried rice. We then noticed we were charged 12 dollars for chips and salsa and then 15 dollars for each bowl of guacamole. Pretty shocked at this point. Cool.   Got home and looked at my bank account to find that 15 extra dollars was charged on my debit card from them. So overall, I'd never come to this place again.",

CON: I don't know why I expected this place to have bigger portions for the prices, but my single little lobster taco was $10. My mom and I came here because we were starving and we didn't want to pay $25-$30 to go to a buffet, but in the long run it would have been a savings compared to how much food we had to order to fill us up at Chino Poblano. Everything is served tapas style - little plates, so it is very pretty and nicely presented (just expensive). If you're watching your cash I'd say don't come here, but it's nice if someone else is footing the bill for you or if you don't have to worry about cost. Otherwise to feel satisfied with what you eat, you'll prob pay at least $50 pp.",

We were hungry, my grandma wanted to be at the Cosmo and we thought this place looked cool.  While it looks cool and the staff is very friendly, I was very disappointed with the food and the prices. My boyfriend bought...well, I can't remember the Spanish name for it, but he said it translates (literally) to Spoiled Cheese.  It was my first time trying it, but he said that it was mediocre for how much he was being charged ($10 for a small thing of cheese and a few tortillas on the side, WHAT).  I got the Papas Fritos, which was actually filling because it was really just a bunch of fries in mole and queso fresco.  It was ok, I expected there to be more cheese and the fries to be crispier. Also, again it was a small amount of fries and it was worth $7.  'Scuse me, but I could go to Robertos and get a huge ass box of Carne Asada Fries for that same price.  I would get five times as much as you gave me. My grandma got the pork buns (Siopao) and man.  That really disappointed me.  After being an avid Chinatown visitor of both LA and Las Vegas, and being of Filipino descent, I was appalled that these four, dainty buns were $12.  If you're going to charge that much, these buns better be damn good.  Nope.  I ate it all though because I didn't want to waste food that was expensive. it ended up being over $40 for just three plates.  Mind you, we didn't even order other beverages.  Oh, and they charge $4 for the chips and salsa. SERIOUSLY?! Sadly, the chips and salsa were the only good dish too.    I would rather go to Panda Express for \"Chinese\" or Taco Bell for \"Mexican\", that way we would've saved our money.",

    "text": "We were running late on a concert night at the Cosmo and it was a rare show where we actually cared about the opening act, so time was of the essence.   While doing a yelp search from the elevator we decided upon China Poblano as:  1) \"Tacos sound kinda good right now\" 2) \"It's Jose Andres!   That dude's been on Bourdain and Top Chef so he's legit\" and 3) \"It gets 3 stars on Yelp!  That means it's gotta be....   wait, 3 stars?!?\"    So we went anyway even though a straight up 3 is typically below my snooty Yelp threshold of place to visit.   I'm glad we did.    We started by looking at some signature cocktails presented to us that arent on the main menu.   I wanted the Aviation which has been one of my go-to drinks lately, and my lady friend wanted something I don't remember the name of, but it was something that didnt sound very \"manly\" like \"the Snow Willow\"   or \"The Kitten's Purr\"   It had cucumber as a main fixture and didn't sound appealing at all to me.    Naturally my friend ordered my drink for me and forced me to order the other one.   I tried both and all I'll say is, the Aviation was delicious! Quick wait service update:  After we put in the drink order, our waiter disappeared for what I felt was a long time.   We sat without drinks and without placing our order for I'd say a good 12 minutes.   We were definitely looking left and right for a trace of him as if we were trying to jaywalk across a busy intersection.     So given that we had a bit of a break, I went to Yelp to try to find some recommendations.   I went with 4 tacos (they're small and I'm big).   and my dining companion went with Mongolian Beef Lettuce.    As long as we had to wait to get our drinks and orders in, the wait for the food was exceptionally as short.   It seemed like only 5 minutes had passed before a few of my tacos from my order arrived, and only a few minutes after that the Mongolian Beef Lettuce showed up.     For my 2nd list of the review, here are all 4 tacos I ordered and ate  1)  Lengua (beef tongue) -  delicious as beef tongue usually is.   Melt in your mouth, well seasoned.   2)  Viva China (beef tendon/oysters) - disappointed in this one as the reviews seemed highly favorable.   I must admit I'm not a HUGE oyster fan, but to me the flavors of the oysters and the tendon just didn't co-mingle well.    3) Carnitas - my favorite.   the pork was tender and delicious and I loved the contrast the crunch and flavor of the pork rinds provided. 4) I cant find the 4th one I ordered on the menu.   Either that or I had too much of that cucumber drink and lost my mind accordingly.   It was some sort of beef short rib with some sort of chile I thought.   It was tasty and the chile brought a lot of smoky flavor to it.   It didn't really offer up anything unique enough for me to want to order it again though  Overall I was very happy with my meal of tacos as a whole.   The tortillas are made to order and taste fantastic.   We actually ordered some on the side to go with the Mongolian Beef Lettuce.  As for that dish I thought I was a bit underwhelming.   The beef was flavorful and it tastes exactly how its described in the menu with the ginger/soy/vinegar components, but there just wasn't any extra oomph to justify spending nearly $20 on it.   The tacos, albeit small, are well worth the $5.50 a piece they generally command.   I like the idea that you could just come in here, grab a drink and a few tacos and be in and out in a reasonable time (if your waiter doesnt take an extended break like ours seemed to) for about $20, or go all out and share a bunch of dishes for an extravagant (and expensive) meal.   Not many places, especially at the Cosmo, give you that option.",

An interesting bistro fusion concept by Chef Jose Andres mixing Chinese and Mexican flavors. The place has a cantina vibe to it with bicycle wheels and lanterns on the ceiling. We ordered a variety of items: Dan Dan Mien, Viva China tacos (beef tendon/Kumamoto oyster), Papas fritas (Fries with XO Sauce), Har Gau, Carnitas Tacos, and the fresh guacamole and the Tres Lychees for dessert. The combinations were excellent but not as crazy as I thought it would be (good/bad). Service was good as well and drinks were rarely empty, a good sign. Maybe I was expecting more cross over between the two styles otherwise it felt like two restaurants in one.",

We ordered everything from beers to margaritas to tacos to pork buns to fried rice. I tried a bite of everything. The stand outs for me were:  -Pollo con mole taco -Cochinita taco -Tuna ceviche  Our waitress was very accomodating and helpful. The restaurant also allowed us to bring in our own dessert for the occasion.   I know some reviewers have commented on how expensive they think China Poblano is for the food, but for us it was a great deal. Our bill totaled a little over $700 for 14 people, including alcohol and gratuity, which averaged around $50/person. Not bad at all considering it was a nice, fun meal with delicious food that lasted over 2 hours.  It's not my favorite restaurant in the Cosmo nor is it my go-to spot for tacos but for a fun, casual place to eat on that property I think China Poblano is a very solid choice.",

My hot & sour soup was neither particularly spicy nor sour... but it was noticeably oily and somewhat lacking in traditional seasonings.   On top of that, the food was overpriced for the portion sizes... if anything, the only thing I could say that was good about the price was that they decided to be cute with the Chinese side of the menu and make things $X.88 ... i.e. my soup was $8.88 --- my friend's dish was $12.88 ...  for those not in the know, 8 is a lucky # in Chinese culture... so - good try to be \"in touch\" and cute, but maybe knock down that first # by a few digits and then we can try to be friends.",

We were promptly seated at 8 p.m. (we made a reservation and I suggest y'all do the same).  I liked the guacamole because it had the right amount of heat. My noodle bowl loaded with veggies was a great drinking base. The tacos were tasty (albeit tiny). The portions are small and the prices are high. Two people in our party felt ill after eating the shrimp.   What I didn't plan for was the bench seating. I was wearing a very short dress plus high heels, as we were going straight to Marquee after dinner, and I had a very difficult time getting up from my seat without flashing the guys behind me.  And yeah, the skeezy old dudes at the table next to us were waiting to catch a glimpse.   This place was a great way to pregame before heading into Marquee but it wasn't a whole lot of bang for the buck, plus that bench was really tough on my sequined-covered booty.",

    "text": "This place is so refreshing in the opulence of Las Vegas. Im brings you back to basics and to the roots of the chef's culture. To begin with this place is socially oriented. What I mean is that you sit with strangers most of the times. In addition to this, plates are meant to be shared. To reinforce this, they will tell you at the beginning that each dish is prepared at different stations that do not operate as a unit, which means that plates will come out at different times. The venue is simply amazing.  We ordered dumplings and queso fundido. Both were delicious. The dumplings were a bit of an acquired taste as the ingredients were a bit out of our normal range, but the meat was cooked beautifully. The queso was rich and also very \"authentic.\"  Our friends ordered angel hair pasta which was absolutely delicious.   The plates are so small and delicate that you really just taste a little bit, good, but just a little bit. However you can see the dichotomy of China and Mexico and how they both converse from opposite sides. There are some very unconventional ingredients from both cultures, which makes it interesting. Once in a lifetime experience for me, wont come again.",

    "text": "It's exactly what I thought it would be. Cleaned-up Chinese food made by someone who doesn't really know how to make Chinese food. I had hoped for a little more fusion, but aside from duck tongue in a taco, they separate the Mexican and the Asian pretty clearly.   We stuck to the Asian side because that's what we're craving, and the Har Gow were very good. They made that crystal wrapper right, and the filling is savory and tender. I wish I could say the same about the XiaoLongBao. The wrappers are doughy and undercooked, and the broth is a delicate veal, which bothers me. I just can't imagine anything Chinese being made with veal - it feels like a huge waste of a cow. I do eat and have eaten veal, but it's just not something most Chinese people would cook with. The noodles are quite nice. The Dan Dan Mian is a lovely hand cut al dente noodle, and the barely-spicy pork sauce is clean and simple. The Liang Fen is less firm than the more authentic ones I've had, but they're really not bad. The chili sauce has a gentle bite, and the turnip butterflies just make me smile.  Dessert is Mango Sticky Rice, the only truly fusion item we ordered. It's made well, and it's an enjoyably sweet, fruity and creamy mix, but I can't get over the fact that it's just mango sticky rice-flavored cream. It's mango sticky rice stripped of everything that makes it mango sticky rice, and I cannot say I like that better.  China Poblano didn't turn out all that bad in the grand scheme of things, but I just don't get it. First of all, if you're trying to break into a cuisine you have no experience with, maybe don't start with all their most beloved and iconic foods. I can honestly say that nothing here was by any means inedible or completely unpleasant, but nothing was memorable. I don't need to come back for anything here, and I really can't recommend this place at all.",

Taking a look at the menu you'll see that for dim sum items that you could get for $5.00 at ANY authentic Chinese restaurant has been surcharged to ridiculous prices.   The service is alright too, most food came out fairly quickly except for my colleague's entree. We had to flag down the server twice to check on her food and only after the second time did she mention that the specific entree my colleague placed does take quite some time. I feel like this is worthy information  that should have been provided in the beginning.

For starters, Chips and Guacamole- they make the guacamole fresh in front of you.   Mongolian Beef- this was tossed on top of the lettuce. Flavor taste like beef in Worcestershire sauce although it was really good.   Kung Pao chicken lettuce wrap- We really liked this one. The flavor of the chicken was really good and loved the crunchy shredded carrots on top. It's hard to eat this one though because the lettuce wrap got soft and soggy. I recommend to put the chicken on the side.   Chicken wings- the star of this dish is definitely the sauce. It's usually tossed with the chicken but we asked for it on the side.",

    "text": "I was pleasantly surprised by this place! I saw the somewhat low star rating, but decided to eat here anyway.  I decided to go with the tasting menu for $45 which I don't think is a bad deal at all.  Chips & Salsa - good salsa but chips are too salty Tuna Ceviche Spoon - best thing of the night! Traditional Siu Mai - only okay Watermelon-Radish Salad - I thought this was good Carnitas Taco - I thought this was good too! Shrimp Mojo - I didn't really care for this Twenty Vegetable Fried Rice - tasted good, huge portion Mango Sticky Rice - NOT traditional mango sticky rice. Was very disappointed in this, this is like 90% whipped cream  I was expecting to not get a lot of food, but I was shockingly full afterwards. The chips & salsa, salad, and fried rice were large portions enough to share for sure. The ceviche spoon was only one spoonful, one taco, and 2 little shrimps. So it was all over the place in terms of portion size but overall most of the food was good so I was happy.",

    "text": "I came here with a group of 6 and we all agreed on a solid 2 stars.   The service was absolutely terrible. It's a cool concept that they have four different kitchens, but we ended up waiting so long for everyone's meals to come out (nothing came out all at once). We had to make an effort to flag down anyone for water, the bill, issues with the food...   The food was not very good either. I had the pork buns as an appetizer, which were fine and exactly as expected (really can't ruin a pork bun). I also ordered the ants on a stick, twig, log, rock...basically chicken and glass noodles. I wanted a meal with some protein, but there was very little chicken in the noodle dish.   My friends' reactions to their meals: -Friend 1: Fried rice was was too oily (it is \"fried\" rice, so I will let this comment slide...) -Friend 2: Hated her chilled glass noodles so much that she changed her order. I tasted them and they were a weird, hardish texture compared to my glass noodles. It was not very appetizing.  -Friend 3: She had to wait at least 20 minutes after we all got our food to get her food. She was not very happy. How can it take this long to make four basic lettuce wraps??! -Friend 4: Finished her meal long before Friend 3 got food. She was also disappointed because the food she ordered was for someone with the appetite of an ant. She had an order of noodles off the vegan menu which came as a few plain noodles on a small plate with some dipping sauce. She also ordered fries with a side of green sauce and it took like 20 minutes for her to even get the side.  -Friend 5: No issues with her fried rice - that's a plus! -Ladies sitting next to us: These women complained the entire time about the shit service and how long they waited for their food. Once they got the food, they seemed even more unhappy than we were. They had a few bites and angrily asked for the check.   I really don't know why this place has so many positive reviews. It seemed like a restaurant that was trying too hard and couldn't quite figure out how to make \"fusion\" work. Not impressed.",

    "text": "China Poblano is one of those spots that has always been on my mental list of places to try- a list that never ends, living in Vegas! I've enjoyed my visits to other Jose Andres restaurants, so stopping here was only a matter of time. I ended up coming in with a friend for their Restaurant Week 2018 menu- 7 dishes across 4 courses, and we added on their queso fundido because cheese is life! The queso was stringy and flavorful, served with fresh, hand-made tortillas that complemented it well- made a good add-on at only $10.   The first three courses were served as duo dishes with one Chinese and one Mexican option each, starting with coconut ceviche spoons and traditional shu mai. The ceviche marinated young coconut meat in a way that made it texturally resemble fish, and I was quite impressed by the robust flavors. The shu mai, while prettily plated with gold flake, tasted standard to me. Second course was the Ensalada de Chayote and Golden Fried Pork Buns. The salad was gorgeous but lacked flavor despite the unique components (squash ribbons, peanut praline sauce, hibiscus dressing), while the buns were surprisingly impressive with a perfectly crispy, chewy skin filled to bursting with a flavorful barbeque pork, well complemented by house-made condensed milk that I almost didn't even try! Third course was a pollo a la Padilla taco, made with more handmade tortillas and grilled chicken, and smelled and tasted amazing, paired with a massive bowl of 20-vegetable fried rice. The rice was well-made and nicely accented with carrots cut into butterfly shapes, but by then we were so full that the rice largely went unfinished. Leftovers made more than enough for a second meal! Dessert was a churro with Oaxacan chocolate- a small but tasty bite. I enjoyed the chocolate more than the churro, which was more soft than crispy.   All in all, this was a great meal and a great value- four courses at $30, spanning a good deal of their more recommended dishes. If you miss Restaurant Week, they also have a $45 tasting menu (see photos for courses) that looks like a decent deal too- my experience was so positive, I'd consider coming back for that!",

    "text": "This used to be one of the few places that I would visit when traveling to Las Vegas. Since we enjoyed it so much the last few times we we went we decided to bring our friends. We were a party of 7 and came in without a reservation and were told there was a 45 min wait. We decided to sit at the bar instead since there was 7 seats all together and could get seated right away and sit next to each other. As we get ready to sit down the hostess tells us to wait outside the restauraunt while she sets down the place settings. During that time a couple walks in and takes 2 of the 7 seats. We went back to the hostess and told her what had happened and she said it was free seating even though she knew we were waiting for those seats which she had been setting for us. I asked to see the manager so the hostess went up to the manager (Alina Deleacaes) and, I believe told her what was going on. Alina then walked up to the couple who took our seats and I assume asked them to move but they didn't and then she walked right past me not even making eye contact with me and goes behind the bar. At this point my friends just wanted to eat and were fine with separating and sitting at the other bar. As they begin to sit down the server at that bar then tells them not asks them to get up and walk outside until the table is clean which is exactly how we lost the other seats. At this point I was livid with how my friends were being treated and walked up to the manager since she would not come and talk to me. I explained to her what had happened with my friends at the other bar and proceeded to tell her how the hostess messed up our seats to begin with and her response was \"this is the first time I'm hearing of this\", \"we'll make your experience here better\". She never even acknowledged or apologized for how we were treated in her restauraunt! There wasn't anybody in the restaurant who tried to help us out or acknowledged that we were not be treated with respect. I work at a restaurant and I would never treat a guest or guests the way that the staff at China Poblano treat myself and my friends. The service we receive is worth more than the taste of the food and for that reason we will never go back and won't recommend it to anyone.",

Lychee sour - 3 stars - drink was super small and just ok. Carnitas taco - 3.5 - I did not have these however 2 people thought they were great and one thought they were solid but nothing special. So I am averaging:-) Tuna ceviche - 4 stars - this was really good. The flavor was layered.  The amaranth seeds and pecans added a nice crunch.  I am not normally a fan of pecans but I enjoyed them in this dish.   Guacamole - 2.5 stars - ok.  Basically avacodo and lime.  Could use some spice!  We added habanero sauce. Ensalada Cesar - 3 stars - ok. Normal basic salad.  Dressing was well coated but had a light flavor.   Chicken Ji Song - 3 stars - solid lettuce cups. Shrimp Mojo - 3.5 stars - good.  Unique burnt garlic flavor  Ambience - 3 stars - cool decor but didn't feel as fine dining as the prices suggest.   Service - 4 stars - outstanding!  Friendly and attentive.  We were brought two desserts on the house for our moms bday! Very impressive!  Noise - 3 stars - music was really loud and table next to us was one foot away and with loud talkers sometimes it was hard to focus on our conversation.   Our bill was $160 plus tip for a party of four. Note - we only ordered 3 drinks so most of the bill was for food!   3 stars overall but would bump to 3.5 stars due to the amazing service!  If you have already eaten that a lot of places in Vegas and are just looking for someplace new then I would consider going here.   However, if you have not eaten a lot of places in Vegas there are a lot more other restaurants higher up on my list for around the same price that I would try first.",

We ordered table side guacamole and it was perfect. The food was so full of flavor and was seasoned perfectly.  I ordered a salty air margarita because the look of the drink grabbed my curiosity. The service was fast, friendly and the overall ambience of the place was soothing. The restaurant has left me wanting to go back and experience more of the menu.

    "text": "This was my second visit to China Poblano, although my first visit was last year and it was limited to a couple dumplings and some drinks.  This time my wife and I came for lunch while the Cosmopolitan was getting our room ready.  The restaurant has one of the cooler buildouts in town - stylish and chic yet still comfortable.  The design aesthetic borrows from Chinese and Mexican traditions, much like the menu.  What was interesting to us was that we didn't sense much \"fusion\" between the two traditions - they menu is segregated between Chinese and Mexican dishes.  We had a mix, but no single dish we had really fused the two cusines.  Let's start off with a story.  Just after we sat down, a party of 4 sat next to us.  After a quick look at the menu they asked the server why they didn't see quesadillas and burritos.  The server explained that China Poblano's Mexican fare comes from the cuisine of Southern Mexico, while they were thinking more about the food along the US border.  The server expertly encouraged them to give the place a try, and they wouldn't be disappointed.  No dice - they got up and left anyway.  The server told us that happens a lot.  That was their loss.  We started with the special Chicken Tinga Tacos with chorizo, onions and potatoes, which my wife and I LOVED.  The potatoes in particular made the tacos, and they went great with the sauce, one of my favorites in the Mexican lexicon.  We also really enjoyed the Don't Be Jealous Hot and Sour Soup.  This was not your traditional Chinese hot and sour soup - the color was much darker, the sesame flavor really popped, as did the cilantro.  It had much more depth than we expected and was almost smoky.    Of the Lucky 6 Sui Mai, we liked the scallop sui mai the best, then the beef and then the traditional shrimp & pork.  All were delicious though, and sui mai is always a personal favorite, whatever anyone puts in it.    The Shrimp Mojo was good too, but the shrimp was a little overwhelmed by the sweet black roasted garlic.  It was a good dish, but I'd have preferred a little bit more shrimp flavor.   Fun place with good food, but you have to like Chinese and Southern Mexican flavors, which my wife and I absolutely do.",

It's a blend of Mexican and Chinese, which definitely worried my wife and I at first. I got the tasting menu with the drink pair and was very pleased. If I remember correctly, I got 11 courses for $55, which to me is a great deal for the Cosmopolitan. All 11 were delicious, there isn't one that I would change.   The drinks were very unique, you need to have an open mind and like all kinds of alcohol for this one. I enjoyed all 4, but I think for two, a sample was enough. The whiskey one I could drink all night.   My wife and I will be back on the next trip to Vegas for sure!",

We were looking for a lighter, healthy lunch, not an easy thing to find in Las Vegas. We ended up at China Poblano as there weren't many other options near by.   I thought it was going to be a mix of Chinese and Mexican flavors but it was actually just a combination of Chinese and Mexican dishes.   The shrimp mojo was incredible. Eight shrimp were smothered in a yummy black garlic sauce that had a great kick with green poblanos. The tuna ceviche was another winner. Amaranth seeds gave it a nice crunch, but it was just a tad too salty.   The beet salad was beautiful, simple and small. Pieces of beets, oranges and avocado were topped with slivers of pickled onion and an orange dressing.   The golden pig dim sum was my least favorite item. They were super sweet and there wasn't enough meat in them.   Overall service was very friendly. Food was great. It was surprisingly expensive as a lot of other reviewers have commented. I would come back but I'd skip the buns!",

On the other hand, they can never seem to get the flavors right and are often way overpriced.    Came here to eat cause we didn't want to venture too far from the room, and we were a bit hungover.  It was pretty late in the afternoon so there was no line and we got seated right away.    Got the swallow the cloud soup, cause we really wanted some soup.  The noodles were well made and prepared, but the broth was just average.  Got the monks chili on the side ($2.88) and that helped a lot, but come on now, $3 for a side of chili???  It's usually free and left in jars at the table in most asian restaurants. The whole plate wasn't \"destroy the noodles and slurp every last drop of soup\" satisfying. There are some places on the strip that make much better noodles.  Also got the Sui Mai Luck 6 platter.  Decent Sui Mai, but again, you need the chii to boost it up in flavor.  Over all, it was a decent experience.  We sat at the bar and the bartender seemed very knowledgable about the food they offered.  Although I cry about the $3 Monk's Chili, it was really good, and the most impressive thing I ordered.  Probably wouldn't come back, but worth a try once.",

I do understand it is Las Vegas, but go easy on your prices and portions -whoever is in charge of pricing!   $6 for ONE small taco!

Please take a guess how much he brought me:   Go ahead...I'll wait.   ....he brought about a table spoon of soy sauce (no joke); n charged us $3!!!!! WTF- GTFO for those of you who know what that stands for.    I had to double check again that this was a Chinese Resturaunt; and I don't know where  y'all are from; but even in the getto soy sauce is FREE! Ok? It's f***ing free...  Anyways, again I asked for a chilly sauce; charged again   Real bummer when I checked my statement, I was charged an extra $6, for the heck of it.  I called in and spoke to the manager, he confirmed it. I was in fact charged an extra $6 for the heck of it; but it would take 72 hours for that to go back to my account! WTF again!!!  That sucks! Good thing I called man. I mean just why? Change your system before people freak out, I already freaked out enough about your service!  The manager was nice tho on the phone. But I'm still keeping my 1 star; and if I could give 0, I still would. No management could ever change that!",

    "text": "If you read my review of Jaleo, you will find that I love, love, love Jose Andres and everthing he touches. China Poblano is one of my go-to restaurants every time my mom comes into town and asks me where I want to eat (I mean, it IS pricy, so I only get to go on my mom's dime ;) ) Everything is so delicious, the service is always on point, and both are consistent.   Yes, it is expensive (their menu is online available through the Cosmopolitan website with all prices clearly listed). Yes, the portions are small. Yes, it is really more chinese food + mexican food than it is fusion (the food comes from two separate kitchens, after all).   We always try to order the more rare / odd items .. can't seem to bring myself to pay $14 for a tiny order of siu mai that would probably be better at a dirty hole in the wall dim sum restaurant (sidenote: can anyone recommend a good dim sum restaurant nearby?)  -- Favorite items: Guacamole with chips and salsa - $15. Handmade at the table, deliciously chunky. Bypass if trying to save money, get it if you're splurging  Viva China taco - $5.50. Rich, chewy, juicy, salty, gooey. Bypass if you do not like foods with \"weird\" textures.   Lamb Potstickers stuck on you - $12.88. Pretty, deliciously crispy on the outside and moist, tender lamb on the inside. Must have  Dan Dan Mian - $12.88. Love the texture of the noodles and the flavor of the sauce. Could be spicier. Have never had authentic dan dan noodles, so I could not tell you if these are authentic or not, but delicious nonetheless. Must have.   Don't Be Jealous - $11.88. This is the biggest portion of hot and sour soup I've ever seen in my life. Definitely meant for at least 4 people. Not a traditional hot and sour soup. Is pretty thick. Very good.   Discontinued items?: They had this chile-relleno type item once with pomegranate seeds on it. It did NOT look appetizing but was DELICIOUS. It looks like a frog with red warts on it. I no longer see it on the menu so it may have been a special, but if you see it, I recommend it!  They also used to have scallop ceviche - super untraditional and really expensive for what you are getting, but really fun. Tiny little lime with a slice of raw scallop and some brown sugar in between. Sprayed with tequila. You are meant to pop the scallop in your mouth and bite into the lime in one fell swoop. I no longer see it on the menu, though.  -- Drinks: Salt air margarita - $14. What fun! Yummy, boozy fun.  Blood orange chile pequin margarita - $15 / glass. Yummy, but be careful, it's pretty spicy!  --  Not such a fan of: They always push the 20-vegetable fried rice because Johnny Iuzzini said it was his favorite dish on the show \"Best Thing I Ever Ate.\" I find it bland, boring, and wayyyyy overpriced.  Dancing Eggplant - really pretty! I don't really like eggplant in general, though.  --  Cons about the restaurant itself: The restaurant is literally right outside of Marquee. At lunch in the summer, it's overrun by trashy girls in swimsuits without coverups and douchey bros trying to get into the dayclub. At dinner time, it's overrun by girls in skimpy dresses wobbling in their heels and douchey bros with popped collars trying to get into the nightclub. Luckily, if you have a reservation, you never have to wait for long, and sometimes they will have you wait inside on the steps rather than out in the throng.   The chairs in the middle of the restaurant have no backs. I'm a sloucher anyway, but sometimes after a big meal you want to lean back and pat your belly, but if you try to do that you will just topple over. There are no purse hooks under the table, and since the chairs don't have backs, you either have to hold your bag in your lap or, if you are lucky enough to be a group with an odd number of people, on the spare seat.",

The chicharron made from rice was delightful and also good sprinkled on the taco. Green beans were prepared perfectly. The fried rice was delish. The menu was an outstanding value and truly delivered for a vegan. My only wish is that there were offerings like this in DC.",

    "text": "We were staying at the Cosmopolitan and came here for a last minute lunch, our wait was only 5min on a Saturday! It is located right outside of the club \"Marquee\" on the 2nd floor.  We absolutely love Chef Jose Andres' restaurant in LA at the SLS Hotel so we knew we'd love this place! It is a mix of Chinese & Mexican cuisines, not a fusion. We recommend ordering 2 items each and starting off with the \"Table side guacamole\" which has the BEST tortilla chips!  We Recommend: -Carnitas taco -Golden Pigs-4pc fried delicate buns/ Chinese barbecue pork/condensed milk: I love dim sum and you pour the condensed milk into the bun for a sweet and savory flavor! -Beijing Glass -bean sprouts/jicama/ avocado/cellophane noodles/carrot/Chinese cabbage/sesame dressing: This was a very healthy and refreshing noodle/salad, the dressing isn't too heavy with an amazing oriental dressing flavor.  Do Not Recommend: -Chilaquiles tortilla chips/green tomatillo salsa/Menonita cheese: The chips were all soggy, the flavor was great but the consistency was missing the few Crispy chips that usually come with this type of dish.  The service was amazing and they have a super cute photo background as well! Would have came back here more often if we had time!",

    "text": "Who would've thought we'd find the best pozole ever at a little spot like this inside the Cosmopolitan in Vegas? And like our server Kevin joked with us when we ordered, \"It's better than your grandmother's.\" My wife and I stopped in last weekend after having been to Jaleo a couple days earlier, which is the other restaurant by Chef Jose Andres inside the Cosmopolitan and we loved it so we thought, \"how can we go wrong?\" The pozole and the chilaquiles were both fantastic but the pozole stood out huge for us. Kevin informed us that Chef Andres served this same pozole at Salma Hayek's wedding, interesting little tidbit of info there. In any case, if you're a pozole fan do yourself a favor and stop in.This stuff will part your hair, I'll tell ya. It's insane. We actually left wishing we had tried something else here too but we just couldn't force ourselves. There's always next time.   Speaking of Kevin, (the guy with the groovy mustache another Yelper mentioned) he helped make our experience here all the more better. Right from the start, with his super friendly vibe, he went above and beyond to make my wife and I feel like old friends stopping by his own home for lunch. He was all over it and never left us needing for anything. He loves taking care of people and it definitely shows. Stop in and ask for Kevin. He provides a five star experience on all fronts.   Although the concept of Chinese and Mexican food being served side by side may seem a little odd, our blissful food coma and the great service from the entire team at China Poblano made it well worth the stop. We already plan on dropping in on our next trip.",

    "text": "Boyfriend and I made our way here after the Marquee Dayclub, so take that as you please on my tastebud judgements.   We were starving but knew we had a dinner to get to later with his family so we came for mostly a snack to hold us over. We ordered:  - Traditional Siu Mai - Carnitas Taco - Swallow a Cloud  I wish we could have ordered more to try other things because I was super happy with what we got.   Traditional Siu Mai doesn't taste all traditional like you would get at a real dim sum place, but it was still pretty good in its own Vegas Chinese Mexican restaurant type of way.   Carnitas Taco....bf and I cheers with the chicharron they put on top and enjoyed a pretty delicious taco with an awesome salsa verde. But $6 for one taco hurts the heart a little bit. But what can you do...it's Vegas.   Swallow a Cloud (wonton soup basically) kind of surprised me. I didn't have high expectations for it and just thought it was going to be a salty mess. Wontons were flavorful, broth wasn't too salty and noodles were just right and not too soggy. But of course $16 is pretty rough to pay for a small portion of soup.   Overall, pretty good dining experience. Service was friendly, but didn't refill on my water often. Food was delicious, but definitely overpriced. But because it's Vegas, I'd probably end up back here again the next time I'm in town.",

None of us were sure what to order, so we went with the waiter's suggestions.  The meal started off great. The chips and house made guacamole were really good. I couldn't stop eating the chips. Sodium was a absolute treat tonight. I could definitely taste all this good stuff.  Each of the dishes, served tapas style, was definitely small and probably meant to be shared. I had the six dishes below. Most of them lacked flavor. Maybe it was the chef's off night. The best dishes though were definitely the Shrimp Mojo and the Gan Pung Ji chicken wings.  *-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*  The Shrimp Mojo - Not the most appealing to look at, but each piece was delectable. We should of just ordered more of this.  Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice - At the very least, taste like something, please!  Dan Dan Mian - What exactly am I eating? There's so little pork that I only taste wheaty noodles and peanut sauce.  Chicken Ji Song - This looked like it was going to be good, if only we were able to find where the chef had hidden all the flavor.  Bistec con Mole Amarillo y Hongos - The grilled hanger steak, another dish that looked great, but alas, it too suffered from blanditis.  The Gan Pung Ji chicken wings - The only other dish worth ordering. So tasty...and so spicy too.  *-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*  Service was excellent. Our waiter was attentive, did his best with the suggestions and came back often to ask if everything was okay.  Probably a place to visit for something out of the ordinary. It's a fusion place after all, but I wouldn't come hungry. This place didn't really hit the spot. At least you'll have room for late night eats!",

The quality of the fresh noodles will ruin you for any other Asian noodle situation where they don't use homemade fresh noodles. Five stars, and happily so.",

Staff were friendly and helpful and the decor was bright and vibrant. The food was OK, but for me the foods from the two countries don't work together and when you add the small plate format to that, then it was confused and un-satisfying -  the fact it is not cheap meant it was a bit disappointing.",

    "text": "I was super excited to try this place over the weekend and was not disappointed!  For those who say this place is overpriced, I say Vegas, in general, is overpriced.  I didn't come here looking for a cheap taco since I can get that at any food truck on any corner at home; I came here to experience a Jose Andres creation and I'm glad I did!  The bf and I shared a few things:  Barbacoa de Res taco - bbq beef with chili and cactus - YUM! Pancita al Pastor taco - slow cooked pork belly with pineapple - My Fave!!! Refried Bean taco - black beans with chipotle salsa and queso fresco (probably the BEST refried beans I have ever had - totally unexpected!) Queso Fundido with chorizo - served with tortillas and really good.  It's not as greasy as some of the queso i've had before (Tres Agaves), so that's a huge plus! Dan Dan Mian - wheat noodles with a spicy ground pork sauce - super good, a little sweet.  It sounds like a lot, but the tacos are pretty small and we didn't eat all the queso, though it was so good, I feel like I could have.  A highlight to the experience was Chef Andres, himself, in the restaurant.  I was tempted to ask for a picture with him, but refrained as he looked pretty busy with his staff.  All in all a good experience - I will definitely be back!",

Potstickers, Chilaquiles and spicy Margaritas oh my! Anyone who thought of combining a menu of Chinese and Mexican cuisine is a genius. A perfect place if you just want to snack, or a wonderful alternative if you feel like treating your palette to more than just your average meal. Perfect for sharing with friends. The flavorful dishes will not disappoint, but I think only foodies will really appreciate this place. I always sit at the bar in front of the open kitchens, it enhances the experience.",

    "text": "On our recent trip to Vegas I researched different restaurants to try - turns out that Dos Caminos AND Isla have closed. We knew we'd be in the Cosmo for the Secret Pizza (that's another review) and I wanted to try China Poblano after reading the menu on the Cosmo website. What I DIDN'T do is check the Yelp! reviews, and I'm glad I didn't. What we experienced was so far different from most reviews that I've just read! OK look - when you're on vacation, you tend to spend money. $15 drinks are the going price at upscale hotels. And the \"salt air margarita\" (I just HAD to try one) was worth every cent!  I have no idea how they do it - the salt cloud that floats on the surface of the drink stays there as you drink, so with every sip you get a piece of salt heaven.  The wait staff were friendly and efficient. The manager, Inigo, even stopped by to chat with K'ayum (age 8) and watched him do his latest magic trick.  We ordered queso fundido with chorizo. It came with fresh-made tortillas and was excellent. Adriana got a carnitas taco and she was thrilled with the chicharron topping. I had a fish taco which was fantastic, and K'ayum had some noodles which he devoured (and he's a picky eater!).  The drinks were what really got me excited. After the \"salt air margarita\" I had another specialty called a \"Mexican gin and tonic.\" It's made with cilantro, elderflower liqueur, and I don't know what else, but it worked. For dessert I had a tequila flight that came with house-made sangrita that was sublime!  I wish I had a bottle of their sangrita for sipping tequila here at home! Anyway, it's a week later and we're still talking about our experience. We loved the decor, the ambiance, the service, the food, and the drinks. We'll be back!",

The tacos were extra wet and fell apart too easily.  Plus, they were really small. We could have gotten better tacos from a taco truck!

Places that serve small plated dishes are my fave because I love trying so many things!  Never would have thought to put Chinese and Mexican food together, but it really worked! Everything tasted very fresh and the tortillas were so light! Tried several of the tacos and the Pastor was my favorite. Great sui mai, pork bao. The Palmitos salad had great flavors as well. Be sure to try the Salt Air margarita! The salt foam goes so well with the sweet and tangy drink.  Yes, the decor is a little odd. Seems like the space in the center was wasted with a large display, but I thought the rest of it worked in a modern eclectic way. I had great service both nights too. The food seemed to be priced to compete with other nicer Vegas restaurants.   Wish I could go back again soon!",

According to everything, hand pulled noodles are supposed to have excellent texture compared to machine made noodles and should be awesome. So i was super excited about the idea that maybe i won't have to fly to china to enjoy hand pulled noodle anymore.   Well I should've taken it as a bad sign when I asked the waitress for the dish with the hand pulled noodles and she looked at me like it was the first time she's heard of it.  She tells me the Unruly Monk dish should be the one that has it.   Next I also ordered a beef tongue taco.  As I waited for the food I watched the chef pull the noodles and then another bad sign. I realized he never once successfully finish pulling the noodles. Half way he would quit cause he messed up. For my entire meal he \"finished\" making noodles twice but he never brought them to the kitchen. They just sat there. Which made me wonder if the noodle show was just a show.  When the food arrived I was very sad. For 16 dollars you get the saddest amount of super soggy noodles. The texture would be described as noodles left in broth overnight.   The tacos were okay but you can totally have better ones in  downtown LA and at a wayyy better price. 9$ for two mini tacos?! that taste average?!   SAD SAD SAD whether or not the noodles were pulled in restaurant or not it was an all around disappointing meal.",

I'd order that again next time  I got a \"had this taste before but there's a definite new twist added\" so it was fantastic. I'd come back here again for a quick lunch or dinner before heading to Marquee next door.  It's True though, don't expect to be stuffed. I was hungry around 4 am later.

Making the dimsum look pretty by topping it with gold flakes did not do anything to make up for the flavor of the dimsum. It  seemed too starchy and you can hardly taste the meat. The noodles looked like a sad , greasy slop of Mai fun type noodles (noodles were stuck together) saturated with soy sauce for color, and garnished with a few pieces of shitake mushrooms, green onions and fine threads of carrots. And yes, portions were small, but that's not really the worst part of the whole experience. Just poorly prepared, way overpriced Chinese food...sorry.",

    "text": "We were checking out Cosmopolitan and accidentaly came across this restaurant. When I looked at the menu I thought it was way overpriced, but then I realized I was in the brand new 5 star Las Vegas strip hotel, so it was OK. All restaurants in LV strip hotel are overpriced anyway. Expect to order at least two dishes per person (around $30) because the portion is really small.   We had: - Guacamole Really good but a bit salty. The tortillas are super good, the best I have   tasted so far.     - Twenty veg fried rice The best fried rice I have ever tasted, rice is cooked perfectly and the vegetables are super fresh. (I am Chinese, so I know my fried rice) - When pigs fly (steamed pork buns, dimsum style) So so. They used the really fatty part of the pork, so I can't really taste the meat when I bite into it. - Chicken JiSong  It was OK, good, but not impressed. - Unruly monk (vegetable noodle soup) Really good noodles, perfectly al dente. The soup is OK.  So among the food I ordered I was most impressed by the fried rice. The portion was super small for $16, but it was good.  Will visit this place again on another trip to Vegas.",

    "text": "This is a tough review to write. I was just here three weeks ago, and I loved the concept and the edgy decor and sttting on benches with people that seemed to either have just come back from the Cosmo pool or were on their way to a club. But you pay big time for the coolness vibe. You may be wearing board shorts and sitting next to a couple wearing shades indoors, but you pay like you're in an expensive joint. When the waiter hands you that collectable little aluminum bottle of Diet Coke, you have just learned that refills aren't going to be free. Get ready for lIttle dinky mini-soft tacos and little everything, all tasty, but again, you end up paying. I think the Mexican side of the menu is better and more fun than the Chinese attempt at things. So if you can get past the prices and a bit of pretentiousness in how they present themselves, the food ends up being a good memory. See what I meant? This was a hard review to write.",

    "text": "Ok, so my brother has lived in vegas for years and this was one of the first times that I was able to get out there and see him and spend any sort of length of time there as well. Also, his girlfriend just finished culinary school so we were definitely interested in going to a really good restaurant, especially one who's chef is of the ilk of  Jose Andres. The food was better than just \"good\" the drinks were very tasty, and there was a wide range of selection in regards to how daring one might want to be. The dumplings and the pork buns definitely stand out and the top favorites as well as the guacamole. Most at my table happened to prefer the chinese selections that we had made but really, everything was very very tasty overall. We went for a lunch so that we could walk everything off later and the place was almost empty. Although, we were probably eating much earlier than many who visit vegas. The meal was expensive, but it was well worth it. I will say, that while the drinks were good, I think that they were overpriced based on what you are able to get in the area for less. However, overall, I am a fan and would enjoy going there again for maybe a slightly smaller meal (we definitely over-ordered since we were so excited about all of the options!).",

    "text": "Until tonight China Poblano was my only positive review of a restaurant in Las Vegas (because their food is awesome). Whenever friends ask me for advice on where to eat, I usually ask them if theyve been to China Poblano (ive considered it to be my favorite restaurant). I live pretty close to the cosmo and order food in China Poblanos to go window on average around twice a week. I ordered my food like normal and sat down outside and was on the phone with my ill mother and after a few minutes a manager (Carrie) gets in my face and says \"this area is for customers only, you need to leave immediately\" and I told her that I was a customer and that I placed a to go order and was waiting for my food and she said \"if youre a customer you would be sitting in our stadium seating.\" I was literally shaking from how she confronted me like I was some kind of criminal loiterer. Their stadium seating is this creepy area in the middle of the restaurant that looks like some kind of religious shrine. Carrie is a nasty, sad excuse for management, and she needs to be fired to reduce the number of customers, like me, who are never coming back.",

    "text": "My wife and I were eager to try this restaurant having just finished a five year stint in Washington DC where we became big fans of Chef Jose Andres.  China Poblano didn't disappoint.  We sat at the Dim Sum/Noodle Bar (there's also a Taco Bar as well as regular dining tables) overlooking chefs meticulously preparing different dim sum dishes.  My wife ordered a margarita, which comes topped with a salt foam in lieu of the traditional salt-rimmed glass, while I ordered a Singapore Sling.  Both were quite tasty.  While we looked over the unique menu we ordered up some lengua tacos (don't knock 'em until you try 'em), which were one of our favorites at Oyamel (a Jose Andres restaurant in DC).  The tacos were as delicious as we remembered them.  Meanwhile, the dim sum chefs in front of us inspired us to try some lamb pot stickers which had a nice flavor highlighted by some cumin and other seasonings.  A gentleman next to us was eating some type of Chinese sandwich which looked and smelt fantastic. We decided to get one for ourselves to see if it tasted as good as it looked.  Sure enough, the Rou Jia Mo sandwich was simply awesome.  My wife and I agreed that it would make a great late night snack...especially if you had a few drinks.  The one downside about most of the dishes at China Poblano is their size.  If you go on an empty stomach, plan on ordering a few dishes.  Of course, that also means you get to try more dishes which is something I can live with.  Now that my wife and I are based on the West Coast we go to Vegas often, and now that Jose Andres has a great place like China Poblano here I'm guessing we'll be frequent visitors.",

At $19.88, it's one of the better values on the menu...The guacamole is worth the $15 as it is a huge bowl and delicious. The sticky rice/mango/crispy dessert is awesome. We request the same waitress, Christine, every time and she is wonderful and will recommend good dishes for the table. The only reason that China Poblano doesn't get 5 stars from me is due to the prices - like everyone else on here says, it's overpriced. My boyfriend and I managed to spend $115 on dinner for two with no alcohol and the dessert was a gift from Christine. It's expensive but crazy good food. I crave that fried rice!",

The waiter didn't tell us anything about the menu, or bother to ask if it was our first time. We ordered a few different things, and it all came at once. This wouldn't have been a problem if the plates were proportionate to our table, but needless to say the plates made us feel even more crowded. Thinking we could get past this, we were eager to eat. Unfortunately, the food was not tasty. The pozole and pork taco with pineapple were decent, but needed seasoning. The two other dishes were just kind of gross and disappointing. Meanwhile, the waiter never came back and a bus girl took my plate. She was probably trying to clear off the disaster in front of us, but didn't  even ask if I was done. In one last effort to find redemption, my husband ordered dim sum. Our mistake, he ate three of the four because he was hungry, but was again disappointed. The people next to us were also having a bad experience. We love the Cosmopolitan, but will not return to this place. I was really excited to try it out, but it definitely did not meet any expectations.",

    "text": "While the overall decor of China Poblano is interesting (bumping Latin music; bicycle wheels decorating the ceiling; bright and punchy uses of color and art), there's much to be desired from this Jaleo stepsister. The concept of combining Mex and Chinese is an interesting one... but it is not reflected in the menu. I was hoping for something along the lines of Chifa (Chinese-Peruvian -- check out my review for Little Dumpling), which really blends the flavors of otherwise dissimilar foods... unfortunately, \"never the twain shall meet\" rings True at this resto. The menu was divided into several sections, making clear that Chinese was separate and distinct from the Mexican options. SIGH. Service was very good (it was a nice touch that the manager introduced herself to us; and our waitress was very enthusiastic), except for the server who, while squeezing orange on a lovely fruit salad we ordered, shot both my man and me with the orange juice and seeds (and didn't both to say sorry!) while squeezing the orange over the salad. The only delights were the fruit salad; the fried fish taco; and the shrimp mole. Disappointments were: the pomegranate salt-air margarita (WAY too tart); the tuna ceviche (again, WAY too much lemon); the lobster taco (lobster was entirely too tough); and the lemon-pepper shrimp (the lemon-pepper sauce made me gag). Good but nothing mind-blowing was the guac.... especially when you discover its price tag ($15!!).",

    "text": "I was very excited to try this place during restaurant week, the concept sounded interesting. A fusion restaurant, that combines the Chinese and Mexican cuisines.  The highlight was avocado margarita, which was surprisingly tasty, the blended avocado gave it a thicker texture and the tequila used for it made it work. Since there were four of us we tried everything on the restaurant week many. The chilled corn soup tasted like raw corn, the consistency was weird. The potato salad was shredded raw potato, with Asian ingredients, and peanuts, the combination did not work. Second course consisted of a fisk taco and a mushroom taco. The mushroom taco was tasty, mushrooms and seasoning worked. The fish taco was not so good, the fish was partially cooked and it was not sushi grade, I had a very long stringy piece that was not eatable in my fish taco. Once I pointed that out to the server they brought another taco to the table, so that was nice. Third set if items were pork belly noodles with Chinese spices, the pork belly was not crispy, actually very fatty and difficult to chew. Also, a chicken tamale with mole was served, the seasoning was overwhelming, the mole had way too much chocolate in it and was way too much on the plate. Last items were dessert items, a flan made with goat milk, caramel and pineapple, this items was pretty good, the textures worked as well. The other dessert item was tapioca with coconut cream, this item was good as well.",

Someone recommended this place to me and I hate to say I will not be back nor will I recommend anyone to come here if you want a good meal that will leave you tastes buds happy.

While the prices were nothing to shake an eggroll at, the food was actually really delicious and the flavors were, dare I say, pretty authentic  As a dim sum snob, I had some pretty high expectations for $13 har gow (shrimp dumpling). It was actually very flavorful, possibly a little too flavorful for har gow. I had the caldo tlalpeno, which is perfect hangover food. It's a nice, savory but light soup with lots of healthy vegetables so you feel real good about eating it. It normally comes spicy with chipotle sauce, but I requested it on the side and ended up not using it because it was savory enough on its own.   The guacamole is insanely good, especially with the soft tortillas. It's like curry and naan!!",

I ordered three tacos:  Viva China (beef tendon and oysters) $5.50: Delicious! A very strange combination especially when on a taco, but hot damn was it good (yeah, I just said hot damn).  Lengua (beef tongue) $4: REALLY delicious! Easily the best flavored beef tongue I've ever had.   Carnitas (pork, green sauce, and pork rinds) $4.50: I was a bit thrown off by the pork rind, but it really worked! Its a hard call, but this was probably my favorite taco.  The three were pretty darn small, but hey they were bomb.  The traditional Sui Mai (mini dumplings) were really good. But everything else I tasted food-wise was just ok.   The drinks however were all delicious. Great selection and bar tending.  The service was also great. So this place isn't cheap, but if you want some different/awesome tacos, you may have found your spot!

I had high hopes because this is a Jose Andres restaurant and I have been dying to try The Bazaar.   These hopes somewhat fell flat. Our selections: Shrimp Mojo: shrimp/sweet black garlic/roasted poblano pepper Silencio Taco: duck tongue/fresh lychee Viva China:  soft beef tendon/Kumamoto oyster/scallions/Sichuan peppercorn sauce Barbacoa: Oaxacan-style barbeque beef/guajillo chile/pickled cactus paddle  I appreciated the interesting mix of ingredients but the Silencio & Viva China really fell flat on the texture side. They were all just kind of mushy. The most flavorful was the Barbacoa. The pickled cactus added a nice balance to the otherwise strong barbacoa meat. The shrimp mojo had a lot of good flavor but perhaps it would have gone better with steak. The delicate texture of the shrimp was completely lost amongst the sauce.   What really saved our meal was dessert: Tres Lychees: a new take on the Mexican classic. It comprised of the soaked cake, whipped cream, ice cream, fresh lychee & fresh flowers. It was an amazing mix of lychee textures and flavors. Everything tasted like lychee but played off of each other harmoniously. Each flower had a different flavor that also complimented the dish.   Tres Lychees just made my night",

However, that was the extent of our exploration of the menu, so I can't really comment on the rest of the food, but at the very least, those two options worked marvelously.  One thing to note is that our waiter came off as irritated or something.  My friends and I agreed that there was something very off about his demeanor, and none of us were drunk enough to be particularly belligerent or judgmental.  He didn't actually DO anything wrong, per se, but he lacked any sense of charm or friendliness that one would expect from a waiter.  Oh well.  Seriously though, try the guac.",

    "text": "We ended up here about twice in just as many days, because there was almost too much to try in one sitting.  They've got a couple open kitchen stations - one for some of the Mexican items and another with a huge steamer for the Chinese dumplings, plus an area for making noodles.  I have to say that at the rather odd hours we were in, we didn't see much more than a few egg rolls being wrapped, however.  They have a fairly large cocktail menu with some interesting, though confusing things, and notably have a couple Chinese beers by the bottle that I had not seen before.  We tried a couple tacos - Silencio, with duck tongue and lychee, was quite good, the duck tongue being very approachable.  Viva China, with tendon and oyster, was similarly unthreatening.  In general, though the flavors were good and the textures were decent, these tacos put so many different components together that they often got lost in each other.  Lamb Potstickers were good, and reasonably, but again not emphatically, lamby.  Huitlacoche Noodles were a little disappointing.  The noodles had a nice texture, but we had a hard time detecting much huitlacoche flavor.  The braised pork sandwich ( Rou Jia Mo Street Sandwich ) was awesome, but about two bites.  We came back specifically to try the Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice.  Expensive at $17.88, it is possible that they did in fact include 20 vegetables, cut into very small cubes, somewhere within the rather small portion.  But in the end it was just that:  fried rice.  We were hoping to see a lot more fusion on the menu, but most dishes were segregated onto one side or the other.  We enjoyed both our experiences - the servers were accommodating, though very casual, and there was a lot to look at in the space, from the cooking going on to the walls of offbeat art.  Overall, and keeping in mind that this is in a fancy hotel casino in the middle of the desert, the food is remarkably good for the location.",

We ordered the Happy Family Potstickers $13 for 6 pieces. The frozen bag from my local Asian market tasted way better. We also ordered the Ten Treasure Soup $18 - can you say bland? The last thing we ordered was When Pigs Fly - $14 for a small steamed bun with bbq pork - tasty but so small, it was gone in three bites. For these prices, I would have been OK if taste was good, but we were neither satisfied, nor happy. We actually had to eat a couple slices of pizza after just to feel full. I'm not a big girl - 5'2\" and 110 pounds. Are you paying for the name of the chef or a meal?? Nope. We're not going back - EVER!",

We shared the bay scallop ceviche, which was ok but slightly too acidic and missing something. We also shared the mojo shrimp, which was amazingly flavorful. This was both of our favorite dishes. We had the Lucky 6 siu mai, which we both thought was very flavorful. Overall it was a creative menu and we would be happy to dine at China Poblano again.",

I went there only once.  It was a food tasting, so I do not know the cost but I assume it is pricey.  It was really tasty and unique.  The atmosphere was typical of the Vegas strip, which is to say that it was super cool.  This place is definitely worth checking out, but I can't see it mass produced on a national scale.",

    "text": "Delicious and amazing food.  Takes a really interesting concept and executes it brilliantly by maintaining lots of traditional Chinese and Mexican dishes in their authentic form, whilst peppering the menu with surprisingly tasty 'fusion' dishes.  As for the traditional fare, the Guacamole and freshly hand made tortillas were delicious.  There wasn't a great deal done to the guac, but the avocados were clearly top notch so thus you let them speak for themselves and the tortillas were as perfect as you've ever had.  The cochinita and barbacoa tacos were exacting and spot-on in their traditional flavor.  For the Chinese side, the 'Traditional Shumai's were light, airy, eggy and packed with umami.  I want a bowl of those Dan-Dan noodles with spicy pork for every hangover I ever have again for the rest of my life.  They were so comforting, and no-nonsense delicious!  The Har Gau's and Whens Fly were both great replicas of what you would find at a great underground Dim Sum restaurant.  For the edgier 'Fusion' dishes, the Scallop Ceviche made my day.  I'm very familiar with Jose Andres' restaurants, and find the 'fluff' and 'molecular' aspects of his cuisine at times to detract from the flavors and enjoyment of some of his dishes, but this one hit it out of the park for me.  The dish is served with individual bay scallops served on a key lime half that has been crusted with what I can assume from my margaritas was more 'Sal de Gusano' (salt, chile powder and roasted caterpillar, yes, caterpillar), and a table side spraying of tequila on each bite.  You're instructed to eat the scallop off the lime and to squeeze it and suck on it while you take on the scallop.  Freaking delicious!  The 'Silencio' taco with duck tongue and rambutan was another delicious 'fusion' dish that I feel doesn't get enough credit because drunken bimbos that wander in here after a night at the Marquee aren't going to try 'duck tongue.'  The lamb dumplings were very interesting and satisfying as well, as they tasted like baby lamb empanadas with a baked cheese crust.  As far as drinks go, you have to try the Margarita con 'Sal de Gusano.'  It will be hard to ever go back to a traditional salted rim ever again, I am in therapy about it now that I'm gone.  My girlfriend & I went on two occasions in our three days at the Cosmo and this was our favorite place.  We did the tasting menu at Scarpeta and loved that as well, but this was the kind of place I could eat at twice a week.  The service was also fantastic and enough has been mentioned here about how cool the design is inside also.  Highly recommend this place for people that know what good dim sum is, know what good Mexican is and are open to trying the new and interesting as well!",

My friend sent it back it was too spicy. I had ordered Carnitas tacos which my server made a suggestion n the Cochinitas which are yucatan flavored pork with marinated onions he swore I would prefers these so I took his recommendation and ordered them they were brought out and Oh Hell no! they were awful I asked for the original order of carnitas and ugh! when they were brought out they were dripping with grease. I could not eat them. So I sat and ate chips and thought gosh I am getting pretty full..off these...chips...",

To start with, you might like to read this informative story about the ideas behind the place: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2010%2F10%2F13%2Fdining%2F13andres.html&s=45831073780d2d7c69d5eb71d82ee6225720e377abc8c064f7467e701939235c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">nytimes.com/2010/10/13/d...</a> The decor is very intriguing, with design coming from SEED. The hybridity of Mexico and China is reflected in the interesting visuals--Mao next to Frida Kahlo and other variations. The entrance includes a fast-food looking window (Chinese Food), complete with noodle bar, and a second fast-food window (Mexican Food) with a tortilla bar. The visual design elements heighten the diner's sense that something hybrid is at play here. We really enjoyed our server who was very informative about the choices. We sampled the Love Is in the Air (a molecular gastronomic take on an heirloom tomato salad). We found the play between salty and sweet to be incredible. The sugar foam is very interesting and I found my taste buds unable to determine, at any one moment, whether it was salty or sweet. The Beijing Glass was perhaps the best noodle dish that we have had. It was outstanding in every respect. Dancing Eggplant is a visual dish that includes bonito flakes that move up and down due to the steam rising from the cooked eggplant. Again, an outstanding dish with perfectly cooked eggplant and a delicious sauce. The only down side was the taco (Chicen Mole). As other reviewers have offered, there is nothing to write home about in terms of the tortillas. They don't seem to replicate street food quality. The chicken was tender, but not the best mole. Perhaps they can work out those kinks. Overall, you shouldn't miss this place. The experience and food is intriguing. Jose Andres is a True genius and artist.",

The menu is extremely hard to read, the dish selection is very random and unfamiliar, the service is complicated (3 different servers) and slow, the price:portion ratio is outrageous, and they are trying to mix two things which just don't blend. Chinese + Mexican just doesn't work is my conclusion, in general is just makes for a way more complicated experience than anyone looking for Chinese or Mexican wants to deal with.",

First of all I don't think you can come up with a poorer idea than Chinese and Mexican food.  2 of the most common food staples, you're really not gonna fool anyone with gimmicks west of the Mississippi. The only reason we found this place was because we were starving and saw Mexican food on the sign, and figured how can you go wrong.  Ordered a ginger ale and sprite which came in like 10 oz little bottles.  We looked at the menu and knew we were in trouble.  Just nothing you would expect from Chinese or Mexican food, and then the waiter explained the small portions.  Um small portions and Mexican food?  Yikes.  The servers were nice to us so we didn't want to be completely rude and just walk out so we ordered a house margarita and chips/salsa out of pity.  $30+ for 10 oz sodas, margarita, and chips.  Average margarita in a \"small portioned\" little glass for $15, wonderful lol.  A complete waste of time and money, took the loss and couldn't wait to get out of there.  Honestly I was just embarrassed to be there.  I don't have a problem paying Vegas prices I get it, otherwise I wouldn't visit here.  But this place is nothing short of insulting, you can get dumplings and street tacos at home.  If you want atmosphere you're better off at a real lounge.  If you want good food, go to Chinatown.",

We hit up China Poblano because it was in the hotel and wasn't fine dining  and looked more interesting than the burger place next door. I was honestly disappointed.   The food was average - some of it was very good, like the dumplings, and then some of it I've had better at super cheap joins in Chinatown. I was feeling boring and ordered tacos, and they were really bland. It wasn't BAD, it just wasn't worth the price. The cocktails were good and the service was great, however, so kudos to the staff.   The worst part for me, however, was the seating. I would have enjoyed this experience infinitely more if I hadn't been expected to sit on a bench or a stool. To my eye (we sat on the \"Mexican side\" of the restaurant) there was only ONE area where any of the seating had a back - along a wall, which faced ... more backless, wooden stools. It was so impossibly uncomfortable, I found it really difficult to be objective about what I was eating. Half the seating looked like high school lunch tables. It was really awkward. I promise, there are chairs in Mexico! No matter how okay some of the food was, even if somebody offered to comp my entire order there, I probably wouldn't go back, just so I wouldn't have to sit there again.  Should have gotten burgers next door.",

The theme is Chinese-Mexican fusion inspired by Jose Andres. Many of the dishes can be shared. Here's what we got:  Drinks: Salt Air Margarita - Their signature cocktail. Instead of a salted rim, the margarita comes with a salted foam on top. Pretty cool, but a little too much foam for my liking.  Mexican Gin & Tonic - My favorite cocktail of the night. The tonic comes separately for you to pour however much you want, which I much prefer. I wasn't a fan of the whole coriander seeds in my drink. A bit too much to swallow as I'm going in for a sip.  Ma - Rye whiskey with star anise, ginger and yuzu. Good cocktail for whiskey drinkers.   Tuna Ceviche - Good dish with fresh chunks of raw ahi tuna. The only con was that it didn't come with chips. Dish is served on a bowl of ice to keep it chilled.   Chips & Salsa - We mainly got this to pair with our ceviche. Chips are made in-house and seasoned with salt and pepper. Salsa was good, but not spicy.  Xiaolongbao - Came with dungeness crab and pork meat with a veal consomme. The dumplings weren't too hot when they arrived, so we were able to enjoy it immediately. Couldn't really taste the crab.  Dan Dan Mian - A modern twist to Chinese Jajangmyeon. Wheat noodles with ground pork pieces. Didn't come with a lot of sauce, which allowed us to get a better taste of the handcut noodles. One of my favorite dishes of the night.  Bistec con Mole Amarillo y Hongos - Hanger steak served in a mole sauce and mushrooms. Good, but not memorable.  Overall, food was good, but expected more given that it's a Jose Andres restaurant. Loved the service. Our server was very knowledgeable, courteous and helpful.",

    "text": "The food and drinks and China Poblano were good but not amazing. I think it's pricey for what you get, but still moderately priced for being in a fancy hotel on the Strip. The service however was lacking. Our server kept disappearing and the pacing of the cocktails in the cocktail flight was terrible. Three of us did the flight and at one point we were all sitting with two or three out of the four cocktails on the table, before even getting a quarter of our food order. We also had two dishes that just didn't come despite us asking twice to check up on it - we ended up cancelling it.   Food-wise, I wasn't that impressed. They were out of the one thing I was really craving, Har Gow, and the various shumai were all just okay. The Ants Climbing a Tree noodles tasted good, but I couldn't sense any chicken whatsoever in the dish. The Tuna Ceviche had a nice crispy amaranth topping but didn't really stand out either. The only memorable thing for us was the butternut squash salad. I'd never had raw squash like that before and I loved the crunchy texture with the sesame oil and ponzu type dressing. I'd try to make that home.   Overall, a decent meal. We didn't spend too much but it wasn't amazing either. Honestly I'd be happier at Taco Bell Cantina since we don't have that at home and the service marched the price point there.",

I love sauces so I always need them on my food. I got some salsa, sour cream, and limes for my tacos and it was so tasty. I recommend you add that.  It was really busy in there I went around 7pm.

We like the Mexican items we tried better than the Chinese. Tableside guacamole was very good, and although pricey it was a generous serving. The chilaquiles appetizer was also good and quite authentic.  Tuna tartare was just okay; it suffered from too many ingredients, and ended up a bit muddled. Dan Dan Mien tasted okay, but the noodles were unusually large and sticky.  My favorite item was the four cocktail sampler, which featured four different cocktails in reduced portions for the reasonable price of $32. All four were interesting, and several were quite good.  The room is fairly high energy, but we has a table in the back corner which had much more reasonable noise levels.",

So while you might be having pot stickers with chow fun and tea, your dining partner might be having fish tacos, nachos and a margarita!  I really do love fusion cuisine and so this is personally not my favorite place at the Cosmopolitan although many people like it.  Other than secret pizza I think I've eaten here more than anywhere else as people keep taking me here.  Of course people never can decide whether they want go Chinese or Mexican so ordering takes a bit.  The traditional dishes are given flowery names. Like Cha Siu Bao or Pork Buns are called When Pigs Fly for the non-indoctrinated dim sum artists.  Every thing is small so family style is not really an option.  I ended up with a pot of tea, the Dan Dan Mian and a couple of When Pigs Fly.  Because I am not a huge fan of this place I usually eat just a little here and go somewhere else like Milk for a nice snack.  I'm sure I'll be back again on someone else's dime.",

When my husband & I ended up on the second floor of The Cosmopolitan, we saw The Milk Bar and I knew I wanted to have a goodie from there.  Hubby wanted to eat food first, so with nothing looking very promising, we decided we would give this place a chance.  Somewhere, somehow, the name \"Jose Andres\" caught my eye.  I figured this place must be worth a taste.  It does seem like an interesting fusion of the two ethnic foods, but the menu and dishes and eating them in intervals was not so odd after all!  At least the name indicates what types of food are on the menu!  Want a dumpling and then a taco?  Great!    I must say that I was not disappointed by any of the food or the service here.  The only thing that was interruptive were the drunk people at the table next to us.  Had they not been here, our dinner would have been perfect!  We got suggestions from our server, which was greatly appreciated and we used.  We were debating on the When Pigs Fly or the Golden Pigs.  We went with the latter because we were told that this is how the Chinese eat the dumplings (with Condensed Milk).  I've never heard of it, but then again, I'm not very Asian in culture!  When we ate the Chinese Barbecue Pork Buns with a dipping of Condensed Milk... it was really tasty!  Next, we had the smallest and cutest little Lucky 6 Siu Mai I've ever seen!  There are two of each of the Traditional, Scallops, and Beef Siu Mai dumplings.  And then we had Har Gow, which were delicious bites of pork & shrimp!  Our Mexican item was a Cochinitas Taco, it was probably my least favorite item I ate.  The pork was a bit dry, but was flavorful.  The last thing we ordered was the Dan Dan Mian Noodles.  Those were so delicious!  The sauce, pork, peanuts, and cilantro made such a wonderful dish to savor!  About that dessert I wanted from Milk... I wished I had gotten my dessert here!  I should have tried the Chocolate Terra Cotta Warrior!  Maybe next time!",

    "text": "This place tries to be very different with a fusion presentation of Asian and Mexican food, and for the most part delivers.   Each dish is pretty small so that you'll need to order at least two per person, as your waiter is certain to advise you of when you sit down.   For two of us, we had four items: Shunde raw fish (Albacore tuna in a soy-lemon marinade, topped with crispy rice noodles, pickled ginger, sorrel and a hint of Chinese mustard), Silencio taco (Duck tongue, spicy Fragrant sauce, fresh lychee), Ants climbing on a tree (Wok-tossed glass noodles with bok choy, chicken, fresh pea shoots and toasted sesame seeds) and Shrimp Mojo (8pc Gulf shrimp sauteed with dried chiles, shallots, sweet black garlic and finished with rajas).   We liked all of these (the Ants noodle dish was especially tasty, and not overly spicy notwithstanding the server's heat alert warning) except for the duck tongue tacos which tasted like freezer burn reheated old duck.  (It's hard to get good duck at US restaurants.)  Another issue I had with the place is that they place your eating utensils - your fork and spoon - right on the table not on any napkin or place.  You arrive and are seated to find your cutlery flat on the table.   Now, scientifically speaking, table tops have or at least can have more germs on them than a public toilet seat. You're actually better off eating off your average toilet seat than off, say, a desk.   I brought this up to the manager - politely - and told him that I'd never encountered any restaurant where utensils are placed on the raw table top. He assured me that the tables were \"sterilized\" (his word) after each dining session and \"deep cleaned\" at the end of each night.   We weren't there long enough to observe the end of the night ritual, but the \"sterilization,\" which I did see done to two tables, consisted merely of running the same damp towel over the two tables, one after another, with no disinfectant introduced into the equation that I could see. If anything this process of using the same damp towel over two tables would spread rather than eliminate germs.   There is so much attention to detail, and the elaborate eclectic menu, plus the interesting video images including of Chairman Mao being projected on the walls are all there to remind you that you're in a very trendy place, and yet chef Jose Andres doesn't know to keep silverware off the tables and can't come up with better than poorly reheated awful tasting frozen duck. I went ahead and gave the place three stars anyway because 3/4 of the dishes we ordered were very good, but the place needs refinement - it's missing the forest for the trees in some respects.",

I realize that I don't find the furniture very comfortable because there is no back support unless you request to sit at the back wall.   This time I ordered the young coconut ceviche which normally I am not a ceviche fan but decide to try and it was flavorful with citrus and I felt like I was on a tropical island. I love how the avocado and coconut went well together. Then I had Pescado Estilo Baja taco! battered and fried seasonal fish, lime mayonnaise, cabbage  and salsa pico Yucateco. You cannot go wrong ordering fish tacos.  And Last I had the Gan Pung Ji chicken wings. A bit spicy which had a kick to it.   As in previous reviews China Poblano is known for Tapas and a great place to Socialize, Drink and have great company.  If you  have a very high palette and not afraid to try flavors then come to China Poblano.",

    "text": "We ordered:   1. Taco Nopales y Queso: basically fancy cactus + pepitas tacos COMMENTS: This was delicious but not worth $6 a taco. I love the creativity and care put into the creation of this dish, but it's probably something I will try to imitate at home rather than buy here again. That said, it was still my favorite dish here.  2. Don't Be Jealous: slight unique twist on hot & sour soup COMMENTS: This was delicious, but I had been hoping to be able to eat around the meat inside the soup. However, it was clear that the broth also had abundant meat ingredients. It tasted good, but I would have been happier if there was a vegetarian alternative available for this kind of soup on the menu. I know they offer the \"vegetarian experience\" tasting here - but we weren't ready for the full $90 experience ($45 a person) between us when we had simply come here on a whim.  3. 18 Monk: stir-fried mushroom + veg dark noodle dish COMMENTS: My husband didn't realize he had ordered a vegetarian noodle dish sans broth, but he loves mushrooms, so he enjoyed this anyway. And it was sure served pretty with crunchy toppings and his favorite pickled purple onion. I tried some of the mushrooms, and even though I continued swiping some of the shiitake, and I was disgusted by the texture of one of the beach mushrooms. They didn't do anything wrong with it, that's just my own taste preferences.   4. Sui Mai: traditional sui mai with gold flakes COMMENTS: I didn't end up sampling this dish but my husband said he couldn't taste anything unique about this - he said that for price he could had gotten at least 3x this amount at any traditional dim sum place. But that's the price of eating at Cosmo on the strip! At least the gold flakes were pretty.  Overall Judgment: This place seems like a semi-casual, original dining experience for someone staying at the Cosmo with a sweet job that gives them money to burn. Or maybe someone who has a distaste for the usual fancy-pants atmosphere of other upscale dining spots when they're looking celebrate a life event with quality cuisine. Unfortunately, neither of those really fit my family's needs. This place seems like it could be great for many customers, but was just A-OK for us.",

I love Chinese and I love Mexican food , but this fusion of Chinese Mexican is amazing , is not just \"on the fly\" thing is well thought out with love knowledge and experience. We had the chef special and it was well worth it , the dishes were small which made it handy since there so many to try . Some of the dishes had me tearing up, the flavors brought memories of mom and grandma cooking , we even had the opportunity to meet the chef and we were so thankful since they were busy. I always bring this place up when I talk about my Vegas trips , this place will always have a special place in my heart.",

    "text": "China Poblano was more like China Problemo with indifferent service and mediocre food despite interesting drinks.  It's not good Chinese food and it's not good Mexican food ... it's also not good fusion food unless you consider \"sweet plus bland\" a flavor.  Olivia started with the Jade Garden Cocktail ($14) with Cilantro-infused Milagro Tequila, Sichuan Peppercorn, Lime, and Makrut Lime. It sounds interesting, right? It was. It also was the only thing I'd order again. My Salt Air Margarita ($14) also sounded cool being Jose Andres personal creation and all. It wasn't ... as the foam distracted from the tequila.  For food, I ordered a couple of my go-to-favorite Tacos: Lengua ($6 each). The Beef Tongue was tender (as expected), but the somehow sweet Salsa Pasilla was the only flavor. Tacos are a simple food, but I don't know if I've ever had more bland, yet sweet tacos in my life.  An even worse choice was the Ants Climbing a Tree noodles ($14.88) dish which Olivia hoped would bring back fond memories of eating this while growing up in China. Sadly, the thin glass noodles were mushy disappointment with a flavor that was neither fusion nor Chinese.  Despite still being hungry, we simply paid the check and headed over to STK for drinks & dinner instead of wasting any more time finding out what other problems exist at China Poblano.",

Could possibly get more dim sum dumplings at a local restaurant but without the luxurious flair.   Snow pea leaf salad: fairly good, nothing out of the ordinary.  Just not that memorable.  Papas Fritas with mole: average typical fries, the mole sauce is savory and hearty quite unique   Service: we sat at the bar and the server was pretty good.  Watching him make the cocktails was interesting.  We kept having servers bring items that we did not order.  We ordered the lucky six but was brought the six traditional.  They fixed the order but it was awkward.    Ambiance: very pretty, feels like a definite mixture of Latin and Asian style.  Not too crowded or cramped but we did sit at the bar.    MoJo What makes this place unique is the combination of Latin and Chinese dim sum offerings.  You can watch the cooks hand make the dim sum, tacos, and cocktails.  You can satisfy two types of cravings here with the wide range of offerings.",

I had the dim sum dumpling soup and asked for hot sauce to add. Everything was just delicious! The portions were a little bit on the small side but we enjoyed every bite and were very satisfied.  My husband said the carnitas taco was the best he's ever had.

The table side guac was good.  The queso was more like fried cheese you get a Greek restaurant, there was nothing drippy or gooey about it . . . I would pass next time.  My friends were not big fans of the salt air margarita and scooped off the foam.  The salsa is has a very roasted flavor which I liked.  It is sort of tapas style and intended for sharing.  Almost every dish included pork, even the one with tofu.  My friends shared some steam buns (when pigs fly and didn't love them) and some dumplings which were also just ok.  I shared the kung pao chicken lettuce wraps which were good.  They can take large groups, the price point is lower than most of the other restaurants in Cosmo and the service was fine.",

Everything on the menu seems to correspond so it's a great place to try a few different plates you wouldn't have known of before, and the portions everyone's complaining about are perfect for mic &match on the menu !

However I did not see any True fusion. The menu was half Mexican and half Chinese, there wasn't a blend/fusion which I was hoping for. I was expecting g something unique line a Chinese inspired dumpling with Mexican infused flavours... However I didn't see anything like that. The tacos were traditional tacos, the dumplings were traditional dumplings.  This is a tapas type venue where you'll have to order at least 3 items to get full. I ordered 4 items on the menu plus dessert and a drink. I don't even remember the items as none of them were memorable.   The restaraunt is fairly pricey for the quantity/amount of food per dish. You are paying that premium for eating at restaraunt owned by Jose Andres and within the cosmopolitan.  The service was good, the decor was nice, and the ambiance was great. It felt like a good restaurant to be in.  The only interesting item on the menu was the dessert (as shown in my pic). I looked awesome and was fun to eat. It tasted okay, but was a fun experience to try.  My bill came to $100, and I wasn't satisfied at all. Not with the quality food nor the value.",

We love the decorative masks and bright animal sculptures on the wall.   I'm not sure what had more spice - the food or our server's killer mustache. Kevin (I think was his name?) was professional, informative & attentive. He definitely added his own personal touch on the experience.  Drinks were fantastic - we had a Jade Garden, a Mexican Gin & Tonic & Flaka Margarita.   The Lamb Potstickers with the crispy cumin lace are our favorite. Tacos are delicious - they're the perfect size to get a couple. Also had an Ants Climbing a Tree dish. It has a little heat, but is huge on flavor.   Desert was the mango sticky rice. Bursting with mango flavor, this dish is the perfect way to finish off a spicy meal.  The manager Eduardo also stopped by to thank us for stopping by and asked about the experience and meal. Needless to say, we'll always be lifelong fans of China Poblano. We always recommend it to anyone visiting Vegas!",

    "text": "I was ready to hate this place...I mean who puts Mexican and Chinese food together and thinks that it is going to be a great combination. But it was late and I was craving guacamole, and this was the only place near by that had anything on the menu to address that late night buzzed craving. I went in for the guacamole, but was actually blown away by the other dishes on the menu.  The guacamole was probably the weakest dish on their menu. It was good, but it won't be the reason I would ever come back to this location. What would make me come back is the young coconut ceviche. What is that? Ceviche is one of those things like carne asada that if you are vegetarian, there is going to be no way that you will ever have the pleasure of trying the dish. However, this place offered a vegetarian ceviche and it was delicious! The dish comprises of young coconuts that have been shaved into large slices, tossed in with avocado, and the tiniest red peppers you have ever seen, and mixed in with a beautiful marinade that just made your mouth want to smile after taking a bite. It was masterful...I have never had an actual ceviche to compare this dish to, but if this dish is anywhere near what a good ceviche tastes like - I may have to turn into a pescatarian.  The other dish we had was the heart of palms salad. I hate ordering salad...it is always the least creative dish on any menu and always loaded with extra fillers instead of the items you really want - ie. too much lettuce, and not enough avocado. This was different - there is no lettuce in sight. The shaved hearts of palm was mixed with this tasty peanut dressing that actually elevated a mundane salad dish to something worthy of ordering. The last dish we had was the glass noodles. The ingredients come separately, leaving the diner to mix it all together (I am lazy and am always horrible at mixing stuff, more often than not there is more food spilled on the table than left on the plate when I mix stuff in always inadequately sized bowls...so I was not happy about that). But once the ingredients are mixed together, this was a lovely take on glass noodles - it made you believe that it didn't have as many calories as you think it did given the fresh, \"healthy\" ingredients.  Overall, I was impressed by this place and would definitely come back to try that sky margarita that everyone raves about!",

The noodles had great texture and authenticity for Chinese noodles but overall due to the oversauced dish, couldn't finish eating the dish.    Had to drink a lot of water.  Really should be 2 stars based on this one dish I wanted to like...but giving benefit of the doubt that perhaps the execution was lacking today.  Liked concept of fusion Chinese Mexican food, the show of food preparation for passersby, and the take-out windows.",

They loaded me up with food and it didn't stop! - chips and salsa - tuna ceviche spoon - traditional sui mai - snow pea leaf salad - carnitas taco - shrimp mojo - twenty vegetable fried rice - mango sticky rice  the shrimp mojo and mango sticky rice were so good, i'd go back for them.  the other items ranged from A-OK to very good.  i'd come back to try some of the other items but i did find the Mexican items better than the Chinese ones.",

We were quoted a 15 minute waiting time, and were seated after 15 minute.   We ordered the following  Veg Jiaozi (Dumpling) w/ some Vinegar sauce Golden Pigs (Dumpling) w/ condensed Milk Ants Climbing (Noodles) Viva China (Taco) Club Soda  Total with tax and tips was $66 23  Pros: Service was prompt, and employees were genuine. (+1) Variety in items. The concept itself is unique. The item and the sauce pairing added a good culinary experience. (+1) Ants Climbing was very good. It had a nice kick to it. Portion on this dish was adequate.   Cons: I asked for Club Soda. A Fever Tree Club Soda bottle (200 ml) was brought. It was valued at $6.00. (-1) Dumplings were no Bueno. (-1) Other than Noodles, other items we had ordered were Pretty Tiny. Pretty & Tiny at the same time. :)  The review is for the very good service, and the unique concept in their menu. I would recommend ordering an item that will fill you up and then try the other items to catch a taste of what this restaurant is all about.",

    "text": "I'm shocked by how low the average rating here is, this is one of my favorite places to eat when I'm in Vegas.  We discovered it totally by accident while roaming through the newest building on the strip, looking for a fun meal. The initial outside appearance of the restaurant made me think it was a food court, but once I saw the name Jose Andres, I knew we were in for something special,  and I wasn't disappointed.  That was over a year ago, since then we have been back several times.  The highest compliment that I can pay to the food is that every time I leave China Poblano, I leave energized, excited, and euphoric.  When China Poblano gets it right, they get it very right, witness the Viva China, beef tendon and Kumamoto Oyster taco.  It's simple, yet enthralling, an amazing contrast of texture, temperature, and flavor.  Every time I have one, it's just as good as the first.  There are a number of other shining stars, like the Barbacoa and Silenco (spicy duck tongue and lychee!) tacos, and several of the desserts (I still dream about the Tres Lychees, why did they have to take it away?!?!?!).  The noodles I've tried were quite good (especially the spicy Dan Dan Mian), but not quite up to the level of the zany tacos.  I have sampled a few things that I'd classify as merely \"good\" like the chocolate terra cotta warrior, and the fried wantons, and there is a large swath of the menu that I've yet to try.  Yes, it can be a bit pricey for the quantity of food/drink, but consider the location, and more importantly consider the creative, meticulously prepared food.  You get what you pay for.  However, those items that I love make China Poblano a destination entirely on their own, not to mention the fun atmosphere and excellent service.  On that note, our servers have always been not just friendly and accommodating, but very knowledgeable about the food as well, and I think that really makes a difference in the overall experience.  I'm always happy to be coming back to China Poblano.  It's a great place to start or end your Vegas trip, or perhaps even for a late night in the middle.  This last trip, we did all three!",

    "text": "You know how when you go to a gas station and pay using a credit/debit card before pumping gas? And you know how the gas station \"pre-charges\" you for a certain amount to guarantee you can actually pay for those 21 gallons of gas your gas-hog vehicle guzzles up? You know how those \"pre-charges\" are immediately returned to your account once you complete your gas purchase? Well, China Poblano treats its customers' like gas pumpers at the good ol' Gas 'n' Goods.  Hold on. Let me back up and write a review for the actual dining experience before I get into the real reason for my 1-star review.  My actual dining rating is probably closer to a 3-star in terms of food taste and ambiance. I had eaten at China Poblano before, while on a date. The food was good and the drinks were well made. I didn't care at the time what the prices were because my date insisted I get whatever I wanted. So the overpriced menu wasn't an issue until my return visit with friends.   During my return visit I chose items a little more conservatively. Only one cocktail, some guacamole and some duck something-or-other. My total bill including the automatic tip of 20% (for parties of 6+) was only $39. Not bad at all really, even though I realized I should have just ordered twice as much guacamole and skipped the duck-whatever. I LOVE duck and always order it when it makes it onto a menu. This wasn't watery-mouth duck. It was over-cooked, barely-recognizable duck. The food isn't so amazing that I would suggest it for large groups in which only one person pays. It is more of a cute place for a date or a place for a group of friends who are paying separately. It isn't even really a fusion restaurant, per se, so if you are craving Mexican or Chinese you should probably just go to the restaurant you crave.  A fusion restaurant usually makes it a point to FUSE two types of cuisine into one dish. This restaurant merely offers items from two different cuisines in separate sections.  Anyway, the restaurant is cute. The decor is different. The only chairs that have backs to them are the booths. The servers are lazy. Oh wait, what's that? Lazy servers at an overrated restaurant that serves undersized and overpriced food? No way!  Now for a better explanation of why this restaurant went from a 4-star on my first visit to a 1-star on my second/third visit:  After my friends and I ate our meal and paid for the meals individually with our debit/credit cards, we spent the rest of the night enjoying some Mario Kart in the room and some hot-tub lounging because well, we were staying in Vegas a full week and this was already night #5. It seemed like a great night all around.  Then when we woke in the morning, one of my friends decided to check his account charges on his phone app. He panicked when he saw that China Poblano had charged an extra 30%. He too had paid $39 including tip and suddenly had a $51.70 charge. Granted, that wasn't an insane amount of money. Only $11.70. However, when you consider that the total bill for the table was over $200, that 30% upcharge now looks more like a hefty $60+ charge spread out over all of our accounts. We all checked our accounts and since we have all been servers in restaurants before and realize that sometimes shady/desperate servers like to add-on a little extra tip and hope that no one notices, we stormed over to China Poblano determined to fix the issue and get our money back into our accounts. We at least wanted a genuine apology.  When we arrived at the restaurant and asked to speak to a manager about the extra charge, the hostess stated \"Oh, yeah we get this all the time.\" Ummmmm, what? You get this complaint all the time?  Well, the manager explained to us that the [cheap ass] credit card processing company they use temporarily charges an extra 20-30% for transactions to guarantee that the funds are available. JUST LIKE A GAS STATION. The only difference is, at a gas station you are pre-paying for something in which the final price is unbeknownst to you until you are done pumping. At a restaurant (especially when the tip is included in the bill) you know exactly how much you are paying right then and there when you sign the receipt. The server then enters it into the computer and there is no more need for any extra charges.   We tried to explain to her that this is the ONLY restaurant that we have ever encountered that has such ridiculous practices. Not only do they give their customers a small panic attack when they check their account balances (imagine if you were someone who went to a special dinner and reluctantly threw down $500 for a nice dinner out with your family and when you look at your account there is a charge for $650 instead) BUT ON TOP OF THAT they don't seem to think it is a big deal or let customers know of this extra temporary charge ahead of time. On top of all that, the manager was very condescending, smug and without an apologetic bone in her body.",

    "text": "I came in with decent expectations. Walking in, they were lowered a little bit. Very gaudy, flashy decor. But once you look at the menu, it speaks for itself.    The food isn't really fusion. They have a mexican side and an asian side. The cocktails are made with agave-based spirits and they have some agua frescas too.  I started with a horchata. It was good.. A little chalky compared to others I've had, but not too sweet. My friend got the mango and it was DELICIOUS.   We ordered many small things to share, starting with the lengua taco.  Best lengua taco I've ever had. Meat was seasoned, tender and simply garnished with radish, onion and cilantro. You can tell the corn tortillas are fresh and made in house (you can watch some ladies making them as you walk in).  Next we had the golden pigs. Similar to Chinese pork buns but deep fried. The dough was slightly sweet and delicious. They're served with a side of house made condensed milk. YUM!   The fries came next.. They were loaded with mole (perfectly balanced), crema and queso fresco. Fries are hand cut. They were yummy. A carnitas taco came out too. Again, best carnitas taco I've had. It was garnished with salsa verde and pork rinds.  The duck tongue taco and a Chinese pork street sandwich were last. The duck tongue was glazed in some delicious sweet sauce, garnished with fresh lychee... A bit hard to get over the mental block, but I still gave it a shot. The pork sandwich was very full of flavor. Chopped pork braised with 5 spice.   Overall, everything was very well executed. They mentioned almost everything was made in house. Service was fantastic. Definitely recommending this place to friends visiting Vegas! It won't break the bank either.",

If everything here was 15% cheaper I would be giving it more stars, but the portions are really small for the price you pay. Granted, I get that it's Vegas and everything is more expensive, but I don't think the food was THAT much better than other similarly priced restaurants.   With that said, I do think that the food was very good and I really enjoy the ambience of the restaurant.   I was at first a little weirded out by the Chinese/Mexican combo, but in reality the dishes aren't necessarily fusion dishes but half the menu is Chinese and half is Mexican, though there are little flourishes that would make it fusion.   There were 3 of us and we each got a taco and a main dish. My taco had mushrooms and crispy pork skin in it, which was pretty good, and I also ordered a Mexican knife shredded noodle dish which had corn truffles and mushrooms. It was very tasty. My friends also ordered the Dan Dan mien which was very similar to traditional dan dan mien at a Chinese restaurant so I didn't see any fusion aspect to it, and we also ordered the steamed buns.",

When I visted their website and saw that it is a Chef Jose Andreas establishment I figured it must be amazing so I said what the hell and made a reservation. I am a mexican food lover so I stuck with things on the Miexican portion of the menu, a few different tacos(barbacoa and carnitas) both of which were amazing, the beef just melts in your mouth it is so tender. I also ordered some queso fundido and some papas fritas to share with the table.  One of the people in my party went the Chinese route and ordered the 20 vegetable fried rice, I tried a few bites and it was amazing, and could be a meal in itself. I will go back and next time I will order the fried rice for myself.   Prices were actually low in my opinion, not cheap but I would have paid more for the quality of food.  Rreat value for the quality of food and location inside of the Cosmopolitan. All in all I would recommend China Poblano to anyone visiting Vegas.",

We were originally going to eat Wicked Spoon but the line was long and last call was in 45 minutes. We knew we weren't going to have enough time to eat.   Thankfully, it was only lunch so we weren't TOO HUNGRY so we decided to switch it up and try China Poblano. I first noticed it was owned by chef Jose Andres. I had a bad experience with Chef Andres and truthfully, didn't enjoy his restaurant over in LA at the Bazaar. So I decided to give him another try.  It was pretty empty upon walking in. We were seated promptly and service was fast. First off, we decided to order some soda because we were thirsty and the waitress comes out with these dinky small soda cans!!! Those sodas were $5!!! We orders some ceviche, tacos, dan dan mien, and chilaquiles. My overall favorite was their ceviche. Decent flavor with a good amount of tuna. Nothing spectacular though. Different cuisines are prepared in different kitchens so food comes out at off times. Their noodles were okay. A good kick of spice but obviously not traditional. The chilaquiles was a joke. Basically tortilla chips with sauce on top. Looked like a cheap mans version of nachos. Can't believe we paid $15 for it. Everything's on the lighter smaller side so be prepared to either eat light or order a lot!  After lunch, that was it. Again, nothing too spectacular. Food is expensive and small. It's much more worth it to spend your money somewhere else. Not missing out if you haven't tried this place at Cosmo.",

    "text": "Located in the Cosmopolitan next to the entrance of Marquee. It's a cute restaurant with Chinese/Mexican decor. On the outside, you can order food at the \"take out\" windows (left is Chinese, right is Mexican). The type of food you get is made in that specific kitchen so everything comes out at different times. The interior decor was just as good as the outside. Mad props to the decorator.   ALSO, came with a group of 12 without a reservation, though the place was busy they managed to seat us in 5 minutes on a Saturday. The service inside was just as good. Our waiter was very knowledgeable.  Pretty much everything here is made to share, with the exception of the tacos. They suggest that each person have 2-3 plates to themselves. If you eat a lot like me and are on a budget, this place isn't for you or maybe just get a taco.  Highlights: *Canitas Taco $5.50 - pretty good but was oily *Mongolian Beef Lettuce $18.88 - type of meat they used was great, lettuce was good with the sauce. Highly suggest this dish. *Pozole Rojo with a shot of reposado tequila $15 (w/out shot $12) - they tell you to add the shot to the pozole but I suggest you don't and just take the shot straight. Some people liked it in the soup, and others didn't *Dan Dan Mian $12.88 - not bad/pretty average. *Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice $19.88 - really good! You can add meat for an additional price but it's great the way it is  If you don't want to make a decision on individual items, they do offer 3 tasting menus (Chef's Experience $55/person - combination of China/Mexico dishes, Jose's Way $75/person - more unique dishes, & China Poblano Cocktail Experience $35 - 4 of their unique cocktails)",

Overpriced tacos, but they are pretty good.  To be full you have to order at least a couple, and I'm not sure if they would do the job of prepping your stomach for a night of drinking.  This place serves small portions, even their Traditional Sui Mai (6 pcs) looked really sad in its large container.  They were pretty small in size compared to what I'm used to at traditional Chinese restaurants.  I had a soup since I was a bit under the weather, the Caldo Tlalpeno which had shredded chicken, rice, peas, carrots, avocado and chipotle.  It was a bit bland, but it was perfect for how I was feeling.  I don't think I'd go back to China Poblano again, unless it was for that same soup, but it certainly wouldn't make me that full unless I ordered tons more stuff.  The dinner definitely warranted another dinner #2 an hour or two later.",

It sounded like a good idea .... it just didn't deliver.   They have an excellent selection of tacos, my favorite was the Carnitas which comes with pork rinds and a squeeze of lime juice. If they opened a food truck that served Carnitas tacos I would follow them around the country getting fatter by the day. Most of our group ordered from the Chinese side of the menu, and everything they ordered was disappointing. The dumplings were tiny and the noodles were flavorless.  The highlight of the meal was the salt air margarita. It is a shaken margarita served with a light airy foam that replaces the traditional salted rim. The salty foam cuts the heavy handed pour of tequila, making it the perfect way to start a night of excess.  Come for the salt air margarita, order some Carnitas tacos, and after you'll be ready for a night on the town.",

For foodies who won't turn their nose up at a beef tendon taco, this is the place for you!  Super creative food and a great bargain for what you get.    We started out with the Pozole Rojo ($9) which is a spicy shredded pork soup with chickpeas, cabbage, pork rinds, chopped onions, radish, and avocado.  This was a really good portion size for $9 and so tasty.  You can get it with a shot of tequila for an extra $3 but our server didn't recommend it unless we just wanted to do a tequila shot. Apparently the tequila is offered for hangovers.  Hair of the dog, you know.  Next we tried the Viva China taco ($5.50 each) which has beef tendon, a Kumamoto oyster, and Sichuan sauce.  Yes, beef tendon in a taco.  This was extremely tasty.  I could eat ten of these.  We also tried the Cochinita Taco ($4.50 each).  It's pretty much pork and pickled onions.  Pretty good, but the Carnitas taco topped with pork rinds is so much better.  Another great dish was the Papas with XO sauce ($6).  French fries covered in a dried scallop sauce.  They serve it with lime, which you think would be awful.  But it's actually really, really good!  The big surprise of the night was the Gaspacho Morelia ($10).  This is a huge plate of very fresh, very tasty fruit covered in freshly squeezed orange juice.  Some of the fruit had some spicy seasoning on it, which enhanced the flavor of the fruit.  Pineapple, watermelon, mango, jicama, dragonfruit, strawberries, and queso fresca. Very good and light.  The cocktails are also very inventive.  I don't think I can ever have a normal margarita again after having the salt air margarita ($12) served here.  The salt foam is a perfect compliment to the margarita and doesn't have the harsh taste of salt on the rim.  My husband had the lychee sour ($12) which was also very good.    $63 before tip and we were very, very full.  Service was impeccable and very friendly.  Just focus on the more creative dishes.  Yeah, you can get a pork bun in Chinatown for cheaper.  Of course you can get a carne asada taco at a taco truck for cheaper.  Come here for the creative dishes that you can't get anywhere else.",

Nothing compared to a clado tlalpeno in Mexico. The portion of the caldo/soup was also very small didn't even fill half of the bowl. Then ordered queso fundido with chorizo and it was very sad to say I hardly found any chorizo, again portions were not generous. Jose Andres has let me down twice. Same thing happened when I visited his Spanish restaurant jaleo, poor serving portions, expensive and the flavor quality is not there!!!!",

    "text": "My friend talked up Chef Jose Andres so much on a (sorta) recent trip to DC that the name stuck, and after seeing it tagged to China Poblano at the Cosmopolitan, I figured it was destiny calling and just had to try it.   I'm not really of the belief that culinary experiences, however life-changing they may be, should break the bank and I'll just tell you now that for two people, drinks, four small plates and dessert, came in at about a couple dollars over 100--but make an exception for this place because it was pretty effing good.   Just know what to order.   The 18 Monk Noodle was so amazing. You don't even realize the noodles are whole wheat, because they're just so good with the sauce and the shitakes. Our waiter suggested we opt for the Tuna Ceviche as opposed to the Ceviche Pargo and I could've, no wait--should've hugged him for it. The tuna was so fresh. The soy it was bathed in and amaranth seeds that topped it really enhanced the fish in a way that is pretty indescribable.   We also ordered the Queso Fundido, and the XO Scallops in XO Sauce. I wouldn't recommend either because you didn't really come here for melted cheese and I don't want you to pay $18.88 for two golf-sized scallops, respectively. That was our mistake--but don't make it yours! A side note, they were both good, but not great and your hard earned dollars deserve GREAT, okay?  After dollar signs kept racing through my head as I tried to figure out the damage, I wasn't really up to pay another double-digit figure for dessert, but the lady next to us devoured her Mango Sticky Rice in a matter of minutes, so we thought, we'd come this far. #YOLO   Anyways, it was so incredibly good! It's not your traditional Thai-place-MSR by any means. It's so light and airy and everything in it just works so well that as I write this all I really want to do is drive down to the Cosmopolitan in my jammies and order it.   As far as the service, and given it was a Tuesday night, we got seated right away. Our waiter, Miller, was awesome! He didn't shy away from putting his two-cents when he knew we were making potentially catastrophic mistakes trying to decide what to eat and God bless him for it.",

    "text": "Mexican food and Chinese food under one roof and not a buffet?  The concept of this place is amazing, but the execution is something left to be desired.  My girl and I wanted to have a great culinary experience at this place, but we left disappointed.  The decor was pretty cool, taking pieces from both cultures.  However, for being more of a tapas place, the table was tiny (couldn't fit more than two or three plates) and the chairs were kind of uncomfortable.  The service was alright at best.  The prices were not very friendly at all.  The food was nothing spectacular.  Being from LA, I could get just as good a taco from several trucks straight off the street.  But, I did enjoy the lobster taco (way too pricey tho $10 for a small corn tortilla taco).  We also did like the queso fundido w/ chorizo.  That was definetly a tasty way to start of the meal!  The scallop shumai were alright and the other tacos were ehh.  Overall, we greatly overpaid for a mediocre brunch.  The place seems pretty cool, but once you sit down and start eating, the allure of the decorations and swankiness seem to just fade.  You leave with a lighter wallet and an unsatisfied belly.  Note: For being a new place you would expect decent facilities right?  Well my girlfriend comes back from the restroom and tells me that the lock wasn't working and that some girl had almost walked in on her using the restroom.  Ladies beware! Haha!",

    "text": "This dining experience was amazing! We came here for lunch and weren't really expecting much as we were just wandering around trying to find a place to eat within the Cosmo. We stumbled across this place which is a little hard to find and were pleasantly surprised. The ambiance was so unique. Sort of asian/hipster combination. There are bike wheels on the ceilings and pictures of monumental figures on the wall that change with time. There are two bar areas to sit and order food or drinks.  There is an amazing place to wait if there is no room immediately for a table. It is really unique!!! The food was excellent and so diverse. I loved the chinese/mexican fusion. We ordered the langosta taco's, vegetable spring rolls, chips & salsa (seasoned so well), vegetable jaiozi dumplings (dim sum), my fiance had the chicken lettuce wraps, and we split the churros. The churros come with a chocolate milk sort of dip it's not solely chocolate. I wish they served it with just chocolate as traditional churros are typically serviced with. They were also a little too sugary. I also wish that they had more dipping sauces. They only have soy sauces. I don't like soy sauce so I was hoping they would have a lighter sauce or some type of orange sauce but they did not have it. They also do not have coffee. If they work out some of those issues, this is a 5 star restaurant :)  All and all we will definitely dine here. We really enjoyed it for lunch although it can get quite busy. Make a reservation or pop in and sit in the cool waiting area. This is a great lunch option at the cosmo! For dinner I'm sure that it is probably a different scene and I'm not sure what that may be! We will definitely check it out next time.",

The guacamole was superb, and I am probably the pickiest avocado-eater on the planet. It was prepared mild (because some people couldn't handle the heat), and the chopped jalapenos and fire sauce were put on the side for me to mix in my own portion. Best guac ever. The tortillas were handmade, thick, and everything you'd want in a tortilla. I put spoonfuls of guacamole and the Queso Fundido with chorizo (which was also excellent) and made little tortilla wraps. YUM!  Service: 5 stars. Our waitress was adorable, friendly, and very helpful. We took her advice on everything we ordered. She explained every new dish, its components, and the best way to eat it.   Tea: 5 stars. Call me corny, but I like to try new things. We ordered Jasmine tea and wanted it mild, so we were given a heavy, metal, Asian-style teapot and a sand hourglass with three different times. We were to steep the tea for as long as the respective timer said. Three minutes for mild, four minutes for medium, and five minutes for strong tea.  Dessert: 5 stars. We shared a serving of flan which came with candied pineapple and a Magnolia flower. I ate the flower, it was an edible adventure. The flan was like creme brulee without the hard brown sugar top. I have yet to find a flan that compares.  Decor: 5 stars. Asian flowers, Lucha Libre masks, dragons on the walls, it all makes sense. Fusion, in every sense of the word.  Overall: This is probably my new favorite restaurant. Everything I love about Asian cuisine, mixed with the familiarity, comfort and spice of gourmet Mexican. Orale.",

    "text": "There are certain DOs and DON'Ts when planning a trip to Jose Andres' Chinese/Mexican restaurant China Poblano, located inside The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas.  DO: pronounce the name right. It's China, like Chee-nah, Poh-blah-no. Next person I hear calling it \"Chai-nah\" is getting chopsticks straight up the culo.  DO: realize its Chinese/Mexican, not fusion. If you're looking for wacky dishes like orange chicken tacos, it's not happening, bub. Although they have a few plates that play with both sides of the aisle (like the Viva China tacos), the \"fusion,\" as it were, is in the juxtaposition of the cuisines. How many times have you been eating a taco and thought, \"This is brilliant! Now if I only had a wonton to go with it...\" I mean, if I only had a nickel for every time, right?  DO: go in a big group. Food at China Poblano is served dim sum style, which means you'll be ordering lots of small plates. Get a group of about 5 or 6 and have people try to order different items, and you could have a veritable cornucopia of food at your fingertips. Dim sum is most fun when you have a lot of people anyway.  Here's the problem with China Poblano (which I believe is Spanish for \"Chinese Poblano\") -- there's a list of DON'Ts as well.  DON'T: go in famished. In fact, don't even go in quite hungry. For China Poblano's menu is mostly \"dim sum\" style, which is Chinese for \"frackin' small.\" If you're going in for a hearty meal, I'd pass right on and head down the hall to Holstein's. If you're ready to proverbially eat a horse, you'll have to get three plates in before you even register a proverbial hoof.  DON'T: go in on a budget. You're going to break it. I promise. The dishes range from $8 to $25. Yeah. For dim sum. I had a plate of 6 wontons, and two fish tacos. Add a Diet Coke and I was up in the $26 range. For two dishes and a soda. Again, if I had gone down the hall to Holstein's, I could have had a huge burger, fries and a beer for less.  China Poblano is NOT a bad restaurant. The food was tasty (although I've had better Chinese AND Mexican food -- thank you Emily), the atmosphere was kitschy, and the staff was incredibly friendly and helpful. Plates usually showed up less than five minutes after you order them too, which is a nice touch. But in the end, one of the most hyped-up restaurants in the resort drops the ball somewhere along the way.  If you REALLY must have Chinese and Mexican on the same plate on the Las Vegas Strip, there's a Panda Express that shares the same space with Chipotle next to Harrah's.",

I sat at the bar and received great service...friendly, attentive, and overall well done. I ordered two dishes: Shrimp Mojo and the Sunfish ceviche. Both were awful -- the Shrimp Mojo was covered in a black garlic sauce swimming in vinegar. I took the advice of my server and ate it with the warm corn tortillas...those cut the sauce enough for me to eat it. The service size was generous enough -- there were eight large shrimp, but the sauce ruined any fresh flavor from the seafood. The sunfish ceviche was not ceviche -- rather it was super fresh fish (yum!) drowning in fresh lime juice. The whole point of ceviche is to allow it to marinate long enough that the acid from the lime juice breaks down the fish...still sharp, but more mellow. It was difficult to choke down...again saved by the tortillas and the blob of guacamole at the bottom of the bowl.",

    "text": "Had an amazing lunch here.  First off the decor is really neat.  You can sit at tables or one of two bars.  We sat at one of the bars and were able to watch the ladies make the Dim Sum.  Our waiter was really nice and helpful, he walked us through the menu, explaining that the food was not fusion, it was just both Mexican and Chinese.  I ordered the Salt Air Margarita.  I am very picky about Margaritas and I must say that this was the best one I have ever had.  The salt foam was fantastic.  Ok, so yes, the food is expensive but it is delicious, and its from a celebrity chef at a Las Vegas restaurant so what do you expect.  I still think it is worth the high price.  My husband and I each ordered a taco and shared two appetizers.  This was a perfect amount of food.  We each loved our tacos, I had the Tinga Poblana which was awesome, kinda like a gourmet breakfast burrito.  My husband had the Silencio, which was a duck tongue taco, he said it was great and the tongues had perfect texture.  We shared the When Pigs Fly Dim Sum which was a good steamed pork bun.  We also had the Chilaquiles, it was great and even better since we ordered a side of Habanero salsa, it was super spicy and awesome.  I would eat here again for sure!",

I am literally choking to death on the ridiculous amounts of salt in every dish we ordered.  Thank god for the chrysanthemum tea that's currently cleaning out the pound o salt I just ingested.  I don't even care that it cost $8 for a tiny pot of it.   I couldn't even taste any of the food due to the overwhelming salt level.  Someone needs to inform the chef that there are other forms of seasoning besides salt.   To top it off, our bill for 2 dim sum dishes and 2 soups totaled $80!!!  I will not eat here ever again and suggest nobody even dare try it...unless you like eating salt!",

Very loud, hard to hear over music and various (close tables) conversations. Food was good, but not sure if worth the price. We had chix wings as an appetizer, and then 2 different types of bowls for dinner. Good option if you don't want to get dressed up, and certainly better than fast food.",

    "text": "That salt air margarita is the perfect margarita. I'm serious. Lining the rim of the glass with salt is so last century and China Poblano evolves the drink by making the salt into the foam at the top of the beverage. Let's ignore the food for a second and talk about this.  I'm not a huge fan of margaritas, mostly because the salt/rim/booze/drink ratio is wildly inconsistent. Either I've got a mouth full of salt and a little bit of boozy taste or I'm tasting the margarita with some watered down salt from an area of the glass I've already drank from. Look, I'm a busy guy. I'm too busy to look down at my glass and play rotation monitor with my salt level. As a result, I'm never too pleased with my drink.   With the invention of the salt air margarita, the salt/drink ratio is perfect every time. I don't need to look away from the person I'm with or my important stock bond real estate portfolio hedge fund papers so that I can assure myself a proper drink. Each sip is engineered to not screw with my ratio. It's great.  The 20 vegetable fried rice is the best food item. All other food items are fine but not as impressive.",

    "text": "I am very turmoiled about this place. I've seen it several times and my guitar instructor/friend has been here 5 times and loved it every time. I had big expectations.   Thursday night, the middle of the Pac 12 tournament week around 9 o'clock in the evening. Not too crowded but people were scattered around the edges of the restaurant. With all the room in the restaurant, we end up sitting at a table against a wall nestled in between about 4 other tables a super tight sardine type squeeze.   Our red headed male waiter did not come around for awhile, but we watched him attend to the table directly to the right of us and a few tables left of us. I kind of felt like we were playing that childhood game, Red Rover, wondering if I was ever going to get picked and the anticipation was killing me! I just wanted to order.   He finally comes over with his rehearsed speech. Yes, my hubby and I order margaritas, and then he disappears for a long time again before we get to order food.  Fast forward sometime later.. The guacamole and chips, hubby's choice, make their appearance first. Very good stuff. Not mind blowing but definitely worth a try!  I enjoyed my \"air\" foam topped margarita and my chili pepper spicy margarita. I had one of the most unique tacos I ever had - a duck tongue - lychee corn tortilla taco. Although I really enjoyed the duck taco, I definitely liked the beef lengua taco more since the duck tongue taco was too unique for my tastes. I also loved the Hao Gao dim sum - the insides combined pork and shrimp when its usually just shrimp. Very tasty stuff. The six pieces disappeared in my tummy quickly!  I also ordered a carnitas taco, but it never came out. I inform the waiter of this and he said I never ordered it. I could have sworn that I did. What happens next? We receive our check, and the carnitas taco was on the bill! The supposed taco that I never ordered! I think the manager noticed my dejected look. He came over and asked us if we were okay and we told him what happened. Our waiter never returned but the manager helped make the correction on the bill and sincerely apologized.   My summary: Food very interesting! Manager and hostess very friendly and nice. Waiter - I think you were having an off day or honestly forgot about us. You probably were tired or overworked and were ready to be done with the day. We had come in from a long road trip and just wanted to relax and have drinks and food. It was just a bad date between us and the restaurant that night.",

We had a few tequila flights, very interesting taste testing.    The caldo tlalpeno wasn't that good had a odd flavor.  The 20 vegetable fried rice ($19.88)was just ok, until I added monk sauce($2.88), it added some flavor to it. The rou jia sandwich was pretty good, the pork was very sweet tasting.  Now the shrimp mojo, looked bad, but was very good.

I tried one of the Mezcal drinks (don't remember the name) which was very good, but those salt foam-topped margaritas are amazing!  Yes - salt foam, as opposed to a salt rimmed glass - unique and delicious!  Apparently, this is their signature thing as our server informed us.  For dinner, we opted to try the tasting menu.  At $45 for 7(?) courses, it's actually a good deal.  But - WOW!  Bring your appetite.  This is not some tiny-bites tasting menu.  It's really almost too much food (why did they finish the meal with a giant bowl of fried rice?  Crazy.  Even our server said it's a bit much!).  But everything was SO delicious.  My friend got the standard option and I got the vegetarian/vegan one.  Everything was amazing but I am still dreaming about the mushroom taco. And the sweet finish at the end, was just sweet enough.   If I had one complaint, it was how the tasting menus were served.  It seemed a bit chaotic, with our food coming out at separate times.  The servers tried telling us what everything was, but even they seemed confused.  And it's loud in there, so we couldn't always hear.  We should have asked to keep the menu handy to know what we were getting.  Our main server, though, was great and she did her best to get our food to come out at the same time.  Not a huge deal, really, but worth mentioning.  Seemed like more of a kitchen thing than a server thing.  It didn't take away from our meal though and how good the food was makes me wish this place was closer to home so I can go again soon.",

One of the tacos I had, for example, had crispy beef tendon with Kumamoto oyster and candied red onion. It was such an interesting flavor combination to be served in a taco! The only thing I wish they changed with the tacos was adding one more taco shell to each. Two out of three tortillas broke on me.  The guacamole is made table side and is so creamy and delicious, we almost ordered a second serving.  I was a little over ambitious and also ordered the papas fritas that had mole on them. Very tasty but couldn't finish it.",

    "text": "Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition.... And $5 for a small bowl of white rice!  I mean I know this is Vegas but this charge for white rice definitely takes the cake. Especially when rice doesn't come with the saucy entrees (like mapo tofu) - how do they expect someone to eat these kinds of dishes without rice?  Overall, I thought the entrees were overpriced given their extremely small size, and the flavors were just okay (not fantastic). My parents thought the food overall was just really salty.  I don't eat a lot in general, but even I thought my portion of food was really small. My dad ordered dan dan noodles and while the flavor overall was not too bad (although a tad bit salty), the bowl was only filled halfway with noodles. I ordered the cold sesame noodles and received a similar portion size. The flavor overall was okay but I definitely didn't feel full.  For the gua bao they only give you one and charge you $8.99 for one very small gua bao about the size of a McMuffin. In most places they usually give you two gua bao.  The mapo tofu portion wasn't terribly large but still really saucy. It didn't come with rice as I mentioned earlier, so your very small entree really costs like $15+   The hongos taco only came with one taco (really expensive) but my sister said it was good. It was just incredibly small and overpriced.  Total for five people was about $65 but we were still hungry afterwards.",

We were most definitely not going to eat at Jaleo since you can throw a rock out the Washington Monument and hit one.  China Poblano was to be our JA experience at the Cosmopolitan.    The restaurant is on the small side, but, as all of JA's restaurants, colorfully decorated.  We got When Pigs Fly, which are the more traditional steam Chinese buns and not the type of buns you would expect from a ramen house, for example.  Vietnamese also eat these type of buns - ban bao - usually filled with an egg and meat.  These buns were just ok, but not what i wanted or expected.  I got the fish tacos, which were just seared fish with marinated onions.  They left something to be desired.  The BF got the Queso Fundido, which was the best thing we had.  It was melted Menonita cheese, tequila and he added chorizo.  The tortillas were warm and tasted oh so gooey and ooey once we tore the tortillas up and dug into the melted yummy-ness.    China Poblano was good, but like a typical Jose Andres restaurant, a mixture of Spanish and Asian spices and tastes, where some of the dishes are a standout and the rest are just fillers. There are just so many other places to go on the Strip, might as well skip this one unless you are staying in the Cosmo and need a quick bite.",

We came down here to eat after we couldn't handle Marquee Day Club anymore.  The three of us ordered the dan dan mien, wonton noodle soup and the beef lettuce dish to share. My favorite was the beef lettuce dish, only because the other two were  disappointing. Portions were pretty small overall, sadly. I really wanted soup, and the broth in the noodle soup was bland, but the wontons were yummy! There were barely any egg noodles.  The chewiness of the dan dan mien was perfect though! And the service was exceptional too. I also enjoyed the restaurant decor because it was really fun and cute, and loved the wallpaper and Asian style decorations.  The food is OK, pretty overpriced, but the restaurant is fun and the service is great. It's really a toss up since this seems to be one of the only Asian restaurants at the Cosmopolitan.",

At the time, there was a bit of construction going on outside the hotel, so that definitely led to the confusion, but it's sort of tucked away with a few other places in the back corner of the hotel.   Second, this place was frigid cold and mostly empty and it appeared that management was interviewing people at a vacant table on the side. Don't you have a private room where that can be done?   The food portions are very small and just not that tasty.  I had the Twenty Vegetable Fried Rice dish that was around $20 and it was just meh.   Service was ok. Nothing to write home about. My husband got a real Mexican Coke which was cool and he enjoyed but of course, that wasn't cheap.   Save your money and go elsewhere, there are much better places on the strip.",

There are essentially three vegetable dishes and we ordered all three to share among my party of three. The green beans with toasted almond slivers - pretty good. The vegetable medley rice - good. The potato dish with Mexican style chocolate and some other sauce - this was just fries with these sauces and this was just awful. We had a 15 year old with us and even he didn't like it. We also ordered three chicken, chorizo and potato tacos. These were, no joking, three bites apiece and tasted like minced barbecue in a tiny soft shell. We ordered fresh guacamole prepared at the table. This was one and a half avocados with trimmings and was just fair. That alone was 16$. Also ordered a salt air margarita and this was horrible. Two sips and said, nope. That was 15$. Ordered the flank steak dish to share. This was cut into six bite sized pieces and was cooked nicely but the mole sauce tasted like the way new shoe leather smells. Two other margaritas ordered were decent. The bill for these items and two ginger ales was 198$. Service was fair, food was VERY disappointing.",

First, when I asked our waitress what the margaritas in the flight experience were, she referred to notes and only listed two of three, and said, \"I think the third is this...\". Did she go confirm? No. It was odd and LAZY. I was a little puzzled that she wouldn't go check.  One of the dishes, the \"dan dan mian\" was highly lackluster. No flavor, lukewarm and just bad. She came back and saw we barely touched it, but just was about to take it away without asking if anything was wrong. I interjected saying, this dish wasn't as good as the others. She responded, \"Yeah...depending on the night, it's hit or miss\"...  I was shocked. Does Jose Andres think his food is HIT OR MISS? I would LOVE to hear you say that with him standing in ear's length. Any chef would be highly offended of this comment.   The kicker? She didn't take it off our bill. So we took it off her tip.   I won't be coming back. Or to any Jose Andres restaurant. Especially if he has servers saying his food is \"hit or miss\". Yikes.",

    "text": "I wanted some enchiladas, but I guess they didn't serve any. No problem, I'll just order something else. Bad idea... I'd be willing to compromise and say that my disliking for the restaurant was due to \"denied expectations\". However, recipes aside, the food was bad in basic fundamental ways that anyone could understand. We started with the Queso Fundito which was super tasty, yet it's was just melted cheese, so idk how anyone could mess it up. Speaking of which, it was literally JUST melted cheese in a small shallow saucer sized dish; why is it $11? I tried 3 different tacos, each costing $6. The carnitas was dry, the fish was rubbery, the tortillas were soggy, and the bottoms fell out. My friend ordered the \"Silencio\", and it looked like she was eating a taco made of arteries. I ordered some shrimp mojo for $18, and I got eight overcooked shrimp swimming in sauce. It tasted alright at first, but with each bite, the overpowering flavor was too much. It didn't taste bad; the flavor was just obnoxious, and the shrimp was rubber. It tasted like some kind of sugary tamarindo sauce mixed with chili paste but without the spice. We also ordered some other fried rice dish which look okay until the waiter plopped a sloppy runny cured egg on top. I won't say it tasted bad, but I'll say the flavor was esoteric; meaning, the taste is something not many people in Vegas are going to understand or enjoy. I'm willing to concede that the waitress did give us a small warning upon ordering, so I guess it's our fault. However, I have to ask: why have an item on the menu if your staff is going to discourage people from ordering it? The restaurant states that the dish is authentically Chinese, which I give them kudos for. However, I'm not even sure how authentic it TRULY is due to the fact that the Mexican food was ANYTHING from authentic. This honestly could just be some overpriced garbage dish being peddled out for profit. Most people in Vegas would rather NOT have a dish that looks like it's daring me to eat it, especially when the bill came to be nearly $100. I felt like I was on an episode of Fear Factor.  All of that aside, the basic fundamental ingredients in our food was disappointing to say the least. I'd rather be in LA where I can get an actual authentic Mexican taco without the dry meat or soggy tortilla for $1.50.",

    "text": "We ended up here just by chance. We had just arrived arrived in Las Vegas after an exhausting 2-day road trip. I was super excited to jump into some amazing culinary experience, but just too exhausted to find it. Starving, we stopped here for what we thought was a quick-service meal and what turned out to be a meal to remember.   The entire experience was very notably high-end and more than worth the price. The staff are all clearly trained and groomed to uphold a very high standard. I am honestly very confused by the reviews that say otherwise. We were seated and served quite promptly. I swear we had 4 different people ensuring our meal was perfect, keeping our water glasses full and bringing out one dish after the next. I noted that, although the place was crowded, a clear path was made for myself and my mother when we came in, went to the bathroom and left. Very much appreciated due to her handicap. I also saw a waiter check every plate and utensil before putting it on our table. At one point he he noted a spoon that was not satisfactory and went to get another without missing a beat. Quality is clearly a focus here.   We had the Chef's Tasting - a tour of China and Mexico that includes a few particularly notable bites. I refuse to describe it because it's an adventure you should take on your own. If you are wanting a typical Mexican or Chinese food experience this is NOT for you. If your are wanting a fusion of the two, not that either. The chef is clearly being innovative and attempting to provide a new experience that compares the relationship between these two worlds.   There were a couple items that were not particularly notable, but nothing was if poor quality or taste. I must say that the shumai was the best dim sum bite I have ever tasted, and I am from San Francisco so it's something I'm quite familiar with. Do not be fooled by the ostentatious gold flakes on top. The flavor is fresh and unique and yet very clearly shumai. I will never forget that one bite. Additionally, I'd like to mention that they use very fresh ingredients and nothing appears processed in any way. Even the tortillas were recognizably hand-made.   If you don't mind the hustle and bustle and perhaps a few minutes of waiting here and there (good food takes time), I would very much recommend giving this a try!",

That is not the case here--China meets Mexico and they made beautiful food babies!   These dishes were the most distinct to me:   On my first sitting I ordered the carnitas tacos and the duck tongue taco. I found the ingredients to be unexpected and was curious of the result of such flavor combinations. On the count  of texture, taste, and quality, these completely succeeded and I offered the perfect teaser for us to delve into a more serious entree.   Next came the pork and quail egg Sui Mai which completely blew me away!! The delicate unbroken yolk of the quail egg perfectly cooked on top of the soft pork Sui Mai generated the most winning flavor with the light soy sauce.   This place was so creative on both decor and food. The carnitas and duck tongue taco, the quail egg Sui mai are a must try. I'm thoroughly impressed!",

    "text": "I've been to China Poblano several times now. It's one of my go-to options in the Cosmo as it has a diverse menu, affordable prices, and the layout is unique. One half of the restaurant is Chinese, the other half is Mexicano. Those lookin' for a celebrity chef experience, Jose Andres provides one, at a price that doesn't break the bank.  Dishes are severed small plate (tapas) style/ small bites. Great for sharing (which I recommend) as there a lot of interesting, unique flavors; some of which are very hit or miss.  First, I always order chips and salsa, it's sad that you have to pay for that, but it's the Strip, I am surprised water doesn't come with a service fee (I jest). When is chips and salsa NOT a solid choice? Never. Order them. It's a big bowl of salsa and warm fresh chips! Nom.  My favorite taco by far is the Pancita Al Pastor, something about pork belly and pineapple combo has always won me over, CP was no exception. Never met an al pastor I didn't like. The Viva China with steak and a oyster was a must order because it was a unique take on surf and turf. This was interesting, not bad, not outstanding, very unique. Glad I experienced it, probably would order it again, but haven't. The Pescado Estico Baja was probably my least favorite fish taco ever. The flavors were just wrong. I do like that the fish was grilled (usually fish tacos are fried), but the flavors were just whack. Skip.  My FAVE FAVE FAVE dish is the Dan Dan Mian. Spicy, sweet, savory, nutty, porky and noodly. This dish is just perfect. Any time I can eat noodles with chopsticks I feel like a cultural boss. ORDER this. My second favorite dish is the Twenty Vegetable Fried Rice. Each time I've gone my counter part has ordered this and it's amazing. The vegetables included are seasonal so the dish was a little different each time.  Solid beer, wine, and libation varieties. CP also has several vegetarian options. All in all, affordable choices, friendly, prompt service, a unique atmosphere, and unique, interesting ambiance and flavors that will please many palates.",

    "text": "My friends arrived on a later flight and hadn't eaten their dinner yet, so this was the first restaurant we found here just by walking around the second floor of the Cosmo. The place looked interesting with it's very casual atmosphere, and so, although I was kind of skeptical about a place serving Chinese and Mexican food, we decided to keep an open mind as it looked pretty decent. But boy, was it a bad mistake coming here.  The hostess was nice enough to seat us right away even though the place looked relatively full. The server came over and welcomed us and asked us what we'd like to drink.....but I had a hard time understanding her as it sounded like she had laryngitis or something. Anyway, we decided to try a mix of dishes since the server recommended we perhaps try 2 Chinese dishes and 2 Mexican dishes just to mix it up. We  didn't want to order too much since it was pretty late so went ahead and ordered the Chips & Salsa, Beijing Glass noodles, Dancing Eggplant.....then we looked over at the next table and the dish they ordered looked interesting so we asked them how and what it was? ...it was the Gan Pung Ji Chicken and they told us it was very good! So ok, we went ahead and ordered it just to try something different.  Oh boy. The eggplant dish had a thick black sauce over it that totally overpowered the eggplant ....kind of tasted like and overly sweet Hoisin sauce, but whatever it was, we didn't like it at all. The eggplant itself was cooked ok, but would have been tasteless without something on it, but not that strong. Next, was the Beijing Glass noodles which is more like a small noodle salad where you have to mix all the ingredients together yourself. Something tasted off about these noodles, and again, we didn't like it at all. Next was the chicken dish. It's basically a fancied up lemon chicken type dish. sauce was starchy and way too sweet.  I think the best part of the dinner was the Chips and Salsa which tasted fresh...and together with our Coronas and red wine....somewhat made us forget about the Chinese food we had just ate.   I can't say I will ever come back to this place as there are so many better places to eat in Vegas. And the prices of the dishes here are not cheap for what you get! Next time I think we'll stick to a real Chinese restaurant for real Chinese food.",

With a party of 5 we got to try a lot of things on the menu and none of them lived up to the standards we have come to expect from an Andres restaurant. From the mediocre guacamole to the over salted mojo shrimp most things were edible but just not that good. The chicken wings were so small they had to come from Cornish game hens. While the hangar steak was a good representation of the meal, it was two small cubes of mediocre quality steak that was tough and lacked any complexity of flavor. There are too many really good restaurants in Vegas for this to be on our future stops.",

    "text": "Mexican-Chinese fusion, really?! - that was definitely my first thought when entering Jose Andres' Vegas restaurant. I mean how could beans and rice mesh well with Peking Duck? The answer is that it can go quite well together.  Two dishes were particularly amazing.   Beijing Glass: a chinese noodle dish accompanied by Mexican vegetables such as jicama and avocado. The sauce soaked into the glass noodles making the whole dish an amazing melange of flavors! Plus, the portion was large and easy to share among several friends.  Silencio: a sweet barbecue taco composed of duck tongues. Andres has always been one to test his diner's culinary limits (just check out my entry for his DC restaurant) and at first eating a bunch of little tongues can be unnerving. But after a few bites, you will not be able to put down this dose of deliciousness.  Other dishes were less memorable; however, they were all good. My biggest complaint were the prices. With the exception of Beijing Glass, portions were a little small for sharing. You had to order more which raised the price a bit high!",

Portions are on the smaller side while prices are on the larger side.  Modern, more asian design/decor and it's in the Cosmopolitan hotel near the upper level of the chandelier bar.  There...with that said, on to the food.  We had the heavenly pigs (roasted pork buns with condensed milk), a 20 (or 24) veggie fried rice, ha-gau (shrimp dumplings) and a vegan mexican spiced hand cut noodle dish.  Honestly the food was pretty good.  Everyone really liked the heavenly pigs though it was only 4 buns for 14 bucks.  the condensed milk really brought the little piggies to another level.  Best plate by far.  The fried rice was done really well, but nothing exceptional.  Shrimp dumplings were really fresh and also done well (again expensive, but that's a given here).  The hand cut noodle dish was interesting.  nice amount of heat and also nothing I've ever had before.    Overall 4 stars.  The food is good and interesting.  Pricey and the service wasn't great.

There was no one in the restaurant when we arrived and I should have took that as a sign of trouble, alas my spidey senses were not tingling...and later on nor were my taste buds.  Arrived with a group of four (3 being from China). I figured this would be a fun place to experience being a mexican/chinese fusion restaurant.  It began with the ordering of hot water that arrived in an iron tea pot, visually pleasing but left a terrible metallic aftertaste. The dishes we ordered were indeed tiny and expensive as other reviews state. My company had two orders of different soups and the fresh handmade noodles but had to quickly report to our waiter that all three dishes were incredibly salty, we're talking \"preserve your tongue for the winter\" salty. Our waitress advised us that a lot of asian customers have this problem, \"Americans just expect lots of salt or they complain that there is not enough flavour\". I found this a little hard to believe being that all other restaurants we tried in Vegas were well under the \"tongue preservation\" level of salt.   They offered to redo the soups but we had enough of the trouble and decided to cut our loses and shared the noodles and a fish taco (a very rubbery fish taco but with nice hints of flavour).   It was then that the hostess provided the bill which included the two dishes that we did not even eat, after reminding her of this they quickly changed the bill but the fact that they tried to charge for everything showed no care at all for customer experience.",

For dinner before a show we ended up at China Poblano intrigued by the combination of two of our favorite foods.  After all, what could be better than a restaurant that serves both Chinese and Mexican food?  How amazing would it be to gorge myself on salsa and crab wontons?    I was a little disappointed in our magical adventure into Chinese/Mexican fusion, mostly because the Mexican far outshined the Chinese.  We enjoyed the fresh made chips, salsa, various tacos, and homemade margarita mix.  In my opinion, the number one item on the menu was the bean taco.  Whatever they did to the refried beans made them super smooth and full of flavor, I actually ended up ordering another after my first.    The Chinese portion of our meal fell very short.  Usually one of our favorite dishes, the Hot and Sour soup was so gelatinous that we barely even ate any and the pork buns lacked flavor and were not cooked well.    Overall it isn't a place I would visit if it were in my hometown and we definitely wont go back on our next trip to Vegas.",

We tried the When Pigs Fly pork buns, the Lucky 6 Siu Mai, the Don't Be Jealous hot and sour soup, and the Shrimp Mojo with an order of homemade tortillas. The only items worth eating were the shrimp and the hot and sour soup. We made little shrimp tacos and it was actually tasty. The pork buns weren't too bad either. I ended up coming back to LA and ordered real dim sum since my experience here was so lackluster. The restaurant was confusing and I was not feeling the concept. I would honestly skip this place. There are so many better restaurants out there that I would not waste my calories here. Not like I have been counting or anything, because I really have not. The staff was attentive though..",

I was a little hesitant because I am not a big fan of fried rice, but it was amazing! Very distinct flavors.   A major advantage to this restaurant is the vegetarian options. The only disadvantage, which has nothing to do with the food is the seating options. Although most people are in Vegas on vacation and wearing casual to club wear, it was a little difficult to get in and out of the bench style seating in a *work appropriate* length dress :(.  On a positive note, our waiter Josue' was very attentive to our needs and made excellent recommendations.",

Yeah, me neither...until this visit.  If this other party was male, it would have been relatively simple for me to just speak up and say: \"I'm not with him.\" End of story.   But this time, the person who entered right next to me was a woman and we took the only two empty seats - right next to each other - at the bar section. Admittedly, to the casual observer, it must have appeared we were together.   A nice server came over and began reviewing the menus for us. She glanced back and forth between us and recommended a couple of plates for sharing. Usually not at a loss for words, I found myself struggling to think of what to say to let the server know we were not together without sounding insulting or dismissive to the other guest.   Fortunately, she took care of this by saying with a smile \"Oh, we're not together.\"   Thank you whoever you were!  Okay now onto the review...so I like this place well enough. It has a very diverse and unique menu blending Chinese and Mexican dishes. Service was smart, friendly, and prompt. Based on a few recommendations from my server, I tried three dishes: shrimp and black peppers, a chicken taco, and a beef tongue taco. Each was tasty, nothing spectacular, but good. Beef tongue taco was fine. If you've never had it, it's basically like a nice cut of roast.   The portions are VERY small. I had three tacos and went to have lunch somewhere afterwards. Think \" very light appetizers\" and you'll get along just fine.   So based on the mediocre food and very small portions, I'm going with three stars. But the service is superb and I love the atmosphere and location, right in the heart of the Cosmopolitan's busy second level.",

For some things there is a reasonable price and for some things not at all. We snacked on the lotus chips and they were great. We got the lamb gouza which sounded good but didn't blow us away. I liked it more than my BF did. The duck fluatas on the special menu sounded interesting and the mole was good but the duck was dry and lacked that fatty rich duck flavor. It was a disappointment. The BF said both of his tacos were pretty good. The stand out was the shu mai sampler. They were REALLY delicious. It was around 65 dollars before tip for two tacos, lotus chips, gouza, shu mai and fluatas and no drinks. Honestly we could eat a lot of really delicious things in Las Vegas for less and I am a person who would happily pay more for food it it delivered in both quality and taste. You could tell the quality was there, the taste was inconsistent across our dishes and that leaves me feeling like there was not a value to our meal.   With so many places to try in Las Vegas I don't know if I would return but maybe for a snack of chips and shu mai because they really were special.",

It's in a crappy location in the sense that it feels like you are eating in a fancy mall (you basically are) and there could easily be an Orange Julius next door.  Other high-priced restaurants in Vegas are able to pull off dealing with that issue a bit better.  I like the theme as Asian and Mexican cuisines are at the top of my list.  The atmosphere was pretty dead when I was there but the bartender was friendly and the drinks were tasty.  I was able to try many things which is both good and bad.  Good because I tried many things and bad because my wallet paid dearly for me not really getting full all that fast.  I enjoyed my taco fine but not for $6 (have had better $2 tacos at local taco trucks).  The pork buns and dumplings were very tasty but again, small and overpriced.  The dam dam noodle was by far the tastiest dish.  The food is definitely 4 stars in my opinion but the value and atmosphere just aren't there given the ton of other nearby options.",

I'm sorry it tasted like someone pre-chewed Mexican food and placed it back into our fried rice bowl and as the dumpling filler.

    "text": "A friend and I were looking around The Cosmo for a food court, and we thought we walked into one when entering China Poblano.  Boy, were we wrong.  We were immediately greeted by a very enthusiastic host who was knowledgeable of pretty much the whole menu.  He recommended things like ceviche, the house fried rice (which apparently is internationally recognized) and some various kinds of dim sum.  To put it very plainly, China Poblano is a tapas bar and restaurant that specializes in both Chinese and Mexican finger food.  The thing is everything here is a bit pricey.  That being said, I elected to just get some chips, guac, and salsa.  I'm normally pretty picky with my guacamole, but I must say that it was probably the best green stuff I've ever had that I didn't make myself.  That says a lot.  The chips were fresh and the salsa added a nice spicy kick.  My friend ordered a dim sum sampler that included two pieces each of whatever dumplings they had, which was also pretty good.  Overall, while we were disappointed that we'd be spending a whole lot more than we would at the food court, we walked out of the eatery pleasantly surprised.  I'll definitely be back to try that fried rice the host was talking about.",

    "text": "I honestly don't even want to give this place ONE STAR. I was there this past weekend.. the girls and I are all STARVING after the pool party at Marquee and we wanted some food pronto. This was right there when we were walking out and we thought it was Chinese fast food. Yannoe? Something quick and yummy and hopefully, cheap. Boy were we wrong on ALL of that! I guess I should have been alarmed that this place serves BOTH Chinese AND Mexican food? Hmm...   Anyways, we walked in, got seated, and checked out the menu. Everything was pretty expensive, but since we were already seated, we decided to just go with it. We ordered 3 hot and sour soups, 2 noodles, and 1 fried rice.. TRUST ME when I say this because I'm not exaggerating when I say that EVERYTHING TASTED DISGUSTING -- keep in mind that I have not eaten in 8 hours and cup noodles would have tasted heavenly.. But no, the food was completely nasty and they got a little vinegar happy on all our dishes. Not only were the food gross, but the portion was TINY. The waitress even said that you'd have to order 2-3 dishes per person to even be full. Really?  After what seemed like days for our food to come out, we decided to cancel the fried rice. We wanted to pay, get the hella outta there, and find some REAL FOOD. Our bill came out to $90ish dollars. It was ridiculous how BAD this place is. Nasty food, tiny portions, overly priced.. need I say more?  But yeah.. Keep in mind that this review is more for their Chinese menu, but I will not be back to find out how their Mexican food tastes like. Please save your money and go to the Panda Express down the street if you want Chinese. You'll be much happier AND you'll get more bang for your buck there than at this place.",

    "text": "A Chinese & Mexican restaurant? It sounded like the perfect place for my husband (Hispanic) and I (Chinese), but it ended up to be a very disappointing meal. My husband has been there once. He warned me about the food wasn't that good, but we felt like I had to try at least once.   We started with the chips and salsa. Chips were fresh and crispy. The salsa was fine, but nothing special. We have had much better salsa in other places.   We had three tacos. The homemade corn tortillas were great. LENGUA (beef tongue) was very delicious. The tongue was tender and the salsa was refreshing. Best thing of the night. Silencio (duck tongue) was disappointing. It was a taco with Chinese cooking style and flavors. Sadly, the flavors just didn't go well with the tortilla. Kind of weird. Pescado a la Plancha (fish) was ok. Just a fish taco. Nothing amazing.   For dim sum, we got the traditional siu mai. $13.88 for 6 siu mai? They better be good! My husband liked them, but they were just ok for me. The filling were a bit loose. The siu mai fell apart easily after one bite. I felt that I am paying for the gold flakes more than anything. Please take away the gold flakes and give me some decent and cheap siu mai! We also had the lamb pot stickers stuck on you. I was very exciting about pot stickers, especially lamb one. Not only we can't taste the lamb, the spice seasoning overpowered everything. The spice didn't taste anything like Chinese or Mexican food. It was more like Indian flavors. Other than the crispy skins, we didn't like these at all.   We also got the 18 MONK NOODLES. I think they have switched this out of the menu now. But it was very tasty. I like hand cut noodles, because they are usually al dente. And these noodles were. The flavors were earthy and savory. We enjoyed it.   At the end, we paid about $65 (without tax & tips). All the food we ordered were nothing fancy. You can get all these food in a Mexican or Chinese restaurant for just half the price. I have nothing against fusion food. I love kogi. But the food in here is just not good and it is way over price! If you are thinking to come here, I urge you to go somewhere else. Jose Andres' magic just doesn't work here.",

    "text": "Chinese and Mexican. Two of my favorites cuisines and we were starving so we thought there was no way China Pablano can mess this up. In addition, the burger place next door, Holsteins, is DELICIOUS and we've eaten there a few times so we thought we'd give this place a try.  The two of us wanted to sit next to each other, but the host would not let us. Apparently, all tables with adjacent seats were reserved. This place was only 30% full. When sat down, we sat next to each other anyway so a different host came and apologized, and pushed together another table for us so that we are more comfortable. Meh, whatever.   We ordered When Pigs Fly, Barbacoa de Res, Don't Be Jealous, and a quesadilla off their \"specials\" menu. Also, a $6 bottle of a small non-refillable coke. Rip-off. When we got our food, they came one at a time so it was more like eating a bunch of appetizers. Which didn't bother me too much, but it bothered my boyfriend that he couldn't try a bite of each at a time, but instead was forced to finish one plate at a time. We had to send back Don't Be Jealous, a hot and sour soup. It had a thick layer of sesame oil and simply put, it just tasted like crap. They took it off the check so props for that.  The rest of the food was just meh. The Barbacoa de Res was $5.50 for ONE taco. Literally. It came wrapped with ONE corn tortilla so of course, as soon as I picked it up, it split in half and just fell all over the place. I've had better $1 street tacos. The When Pigs Fly was a microwaved dumpling. I can tell because I'm Asian. How disappointing. The filling was just bland sauce. The quesadilla was the best out of the 4 dishes and even that I could have made a better one at home, and it was 4 bites for $12. Let me just say that we don't mind paying stupid amounts of $$ for small plates, as long as they taste good.   Wow. We were so upset that we didn't just go to Holsteins instead. Bad even for a strip restaurant. As a local, I hope this review will help others avoid this tourist trap restaurant.",

I came here with a great friend from Hong Kong so the expectations were good quality Chinese food.  The food was very average with there signature \"20 vegetable fried rice\" for $19.88 being nothing more than your average fried rice that was actually over-seasoned with oyster sauce making it terribly salty and almost unpalatable.   The pork buns were average but (4) for $13.88 was hefty price to pay for average dim sum pork buns.  The hot and sour soup had a strong after taste.   The service was good and quick. The food came out very quickly which made us wonder if it was all prepared before hand.  One MUST TRY is the the drinks! I highly recommend Jose Andres' margarita . They had option to add pomegranate and that was just one amazing creation.  Small quantity and $15 but a must try.",

Our Sui Mui had a weird fishy aftertaste and made us both a little nervous. The Taco we ordered was a good weird. I'd try it again if I had an opportunity.  Price was to be expected being on the strip but I'll never get used to paying $5 for an 8 ounce bottle of Coke.

I know, I know after all this is Las Vegas so everything is priced three times what it usually should cost. It is completely beyond me how people can charge this much for food. During this particular visit I arrived with seven other guests three of which were menly men (like these boys could eat). One of them even asked which is your largest meal and the waiter responded with Twenty Vegetable Fried Rice. Judging by it's miniture size I doubt it actually had twenty vegetables it was probably named that cause it cost close to twenty dollars!   Next up is the Rou Jia Mo Street Sandwich it is braised red pork in a chinese flat bread. It was tasty but a bit on the salty side and was almost half the size of my iphone!   Then my hunny and I split the Shrimp Mojo per the waiter's recommendation. It was packed full or flavor and mouthwatering good. It was $16 for eight pieces.  Again my complaint isn't towards the taste or quality of the food mainly the portions. The service was good we were seated within 10 minutes for a party of eight while other places had hour long wait times. The restaurant decor and arrangement was very chic and trendy. But after loosing my butt in the casino I doubt I'd be able to pay for a substantial lunch here!",

    "text": "If not for the out-of-this-world carnitas tacos (yay for pork rinds!) I think I would have given this place only 2 stars.  It advertises itself as \"chinese/mexican fusion\", but the menu is really just split up into various mexican dishes and chinese dishes (mostly of the dim sum variety). As an overall note, I think that the Mexican dishes were much tastier than the chinese items, so if you are wrestling b/w the two, I would go with Mexican. Here's what we tried:  TACOS Carnitas - yum yum yum.  Definitely order this if you order nothing else.  And get two, so that you won't have to share. A+  Viva china - this is a kumamoto oyster/beef tendon/sichuan peppercorn sauce taco.  The combo of the tendon and oyster was underwhelming, and if you really love that peppercorn taste, you're not going to find much of it here. C-  Barbacoa - we ordered this because it came with \"cactus paddle\".  Still have no idea what cactus paddle is, but it's an awesome name!  The beef was alright, though a bit salty, and the cactus unfortunately didn't really taste like anything at all. C-  fried fish taco - the fish was fried nicely, and I liked the pickled onions that came with it, but it was close to 7 bucks for two tiny tacos and pinky sized pieces of fish, so probably wouldn't order it again.  B-  CHINESE  Fire Phoenix - This was pretty much a variation of popcorn chicken, with pork rinds on the side.The sichuan peppercorn salt was really good, and fried chicken never tastes bad when it's fres, but there really wasn't anything that special about this dish.  C  MEXICAN  Tuna ceviche - Comes on a bed of ice and looks delectable.  Tastes pretty a-ok too. I think they put soy sauce in here, which gives it a nice depth of flavor.  A-  Coctel de camarones - This was pretty much like a cold cocktail of shrimp, crab, and avocado, mixed with what is essentially a cocktail sauce.  I love lump crab meat and I love shrimp, but I didn't come here to eat those things with cocktail sauce.  I can get that for 3.99 anywhere else.  C  Shrimp mojo - This actually did taste like a fusion dish, though it was a bit heavily sauced.  The shrimp are nice and garlic-y, with a hint of spice from the poblano peppers.  Good, but could have used a side of rice or something.  B-  In a nutshell:  I'd recommend just stopping in and sitting at the counter and ordering some tacos (especially the carnitas ones), and then going somewhere else for dinner.  As a disclaimer, we didn't order the famous \"twenty ingredient fried rice\" that was featured on food network, but I'm taiwanese, and I just don't feel right paying 20 bucks for fried rice.",

Nothing special at all (I would say some of the noodle dishes tasted premade).   The tacos are tiny and pricey! I would say they are definitely not worth it (even though they have some cool combinations like Mushrooms and Guac).  The only outstanding items I had here were the lamb potstickers. They were juicy, unique, and tasty!",

    "text": "We initially wanted to go to the buffet \"Wicked Spoon\" but was told that the place will be closing in an hour so we decided to check out a place near by instead and found \"China Poblano\".  I personally wonder how long this restaurant will last.  I did like the ambiance the place.  Our service was good and timely but the food is not worth the price.   Okay, so first off the server indicated to us that there were no scallops, no lobster and no crab so we had to change up our initial choices.  We ended up with the Mojo Shrimp, Steak Mole plate (I forget the name), sui mai quail eggs and sui mai scallop. So, the Mojo Shrimp was slightly undercooked and it tasted like it was doused in soy sauce reminding me of like Filipino adobo sauce (not in a good way).  The sauce was super salty.  We couldn't even finish the green beans in the sauce.  The Steak Mole plate according to my eating partner was cooked very good but it tasted like steak that I get in my local taco places around my apartment.  ( I live in the mission in SF so I'm surrounded by very satisfying Mexican food).  The mole sauce was pretty bland. The mushrooms and onions were super salty.  The sui mai was okay.  We were told that they could do scallop sui mai but we suspected that there were no scallops in it.  The quail egg sui mai was probably my favorite.  But again I live near a Chinese restaurant that does sui mai so I wasn't blown away. However, the quail egg was something I've never tried before and I wished that the whole experience was like that.  Eating unique dishes that elevated dishes that were traditionally Mexican or Chinese.  What we got was dishes that weren't unique enough for the price point.  The dishes are overpriced and small!  My friend ended up buying a hamburger and strawberry milkshake at Johnny Rockets afterwards.   I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone except to deer who like salt lick.",

    "text": "I must preface this review by saying that it's given with knowledge that it's on-strip(pricey) and gourmet(small portions).  I just love the fact that I could get such a variety of food of my two favorite types, Mexican and Chinese.   I love tacos and noodles so I for the second visit I stayed with the same noodles with a variety of seafood that I felt was just perfect for sharing.  The noodles were just right along with seafood that was far more than I expected in a shared dish.  As for the tacos I've tried the lengua, pescado frito, and carnitas.  While they were all delicious and I really love how the serving dish keeps them upright for great presentation the carnitas prompted myself and my friend to order a couple more, the sauce and the pork rind just adds the right flavor.    If you can expense a meal or up for a pricey tasting of a delicious variety with friends this is the place to eat.",

Nothing compares--the crispy texture of the amaranth with the soft, fresh fish is a force to be reckoned with. I love the cocktails--Lychee is the best one!! The pork tacos are amazing. The Kao Lao Lao noodles, with dragon sauce, are my favorite item on the menu...aside from the ceviche. The service never disappoints. The servers know and love the menu.

Boy what a disappointment we had. Everything was so bland and way overpriced for crappy food. We ordered several different tacos, ceaser salad, palm salad, posole and chips and salsa. Tasteless and under par. The tacos at dell tacos or taco bell taste better. The only thing that was ok were the chips, salsa was disappointing so then it made the chips not enjoyable.",

    "text": "My brother wanted to try this place out and rightfully so.  I mean how many places serve chinese and mexican food under one roof?  Notwithstanding the concept, the bright lights and artistic decor you felt like something was a bit off.  I expected to see a fusion of dishes on the menu, but instead it was more like two restaurants on one menu.  Although I feel like its a novel concept, the prices are high for what it normally costs.  Now granted maybe it costs more to maintain this kind of a restaurant, but the general knowledge of mexican and chinese food, is that it shouldn't be extremely expensive without some fancy hard to find, hard to spell, impossible to make dish that's tagged for $$$ dollars   Ordered: Chips and Salsa $4 (The chips were good and the salsa was fire roasted)  The Unruly Monk - hand-cut noodles/ wild wood ear mushrooms/ poached egg/spicy sauce $17.88  (Very good, although I've had this at a standard chinese restaurant at very good tastes for half the price.)  Lengua  - beef tongue/salsa pasilla $4 (Fantastic melted in your mouth)  Viva China - soft beef tendon/ Kumamoto oyster/scallions/ Sichuan peppercorn sauce $5.50 (One of the strangest things I've ever tasted, I'm still not sure if I liked it or not.  The consistency of the oyster just makes the whole thing a little off.)  So in summary, this restaurant is an interesting idea, although I don't think its implemented quite right.  Pre established bargain cuisine, such as Chinese and Mexican, can certainly throw someone well versed in that universe into a frenzy with prices.  Although our waiter was great, the service just didn't justify the prices.  If you don't plan to eat much, then it's $$, but if you plan to actually eat a meal, then make it $$$.    Would I go back?  Sorry, but my dollars will be going elsewhere",

    "text": "As we were gathering our things after touching down at McCarren airport, our main concern was of course food. I suggested Mexican (per usual) while my friend had been thinking Chinese. Well you can imagine our surprise when the concierge mentioned a Mexican-Chinese fusion restaurant within our very hotel.  This is not your standard Mexican. So be prepared to shell out a lot of money for each very small taco. However, it is somewhat worth it. My friends ordered Green Tea Sour cocktails (with an edible marigold) while I tried a new beer: Moutai - it was light and exactly what I needed with my food.   I tried the Barbacoas and Carnitas tacos. The Carnitas was quite delicious but I am not quite used to the consistency of pork belly, so it was a bit of shock to bite into something so... jelly-like.   We ordered the Twenty-vegetable fried rice because apparently it was on some well-known foodie list and we weren't disappointed at all.  Like all of our food, it was light, incredibly fresh and made with simple ingredients.   For dessert I had the Mango Sticky Rice. Coconut milk is boiled to a cream and then added to shaved mango and sprinkled with crisped rice to create something incredible. Loved.    The decor inside China Poblano was... interesting. There were steering wheels spanning most of the ceiling, an altar of buddhas near the entrance,  low ottoman seating and a red/orange color palette.     What I loved? There is one \"bar\" for Mexican  and one for the Asian inspired dishes. Each were incredibly clean and each dish is served as it is ready so if you order several things (as you will need to) you do not have to place the same emphasis on some of the more traditional dining rules.    While I enjoyed my experience there (for the most part...) I do not think I would go again. It is definitely a great place to pop into if you are in a bit of a rush and not  particularly hungry, or else $6 per tiny taco just becomes a bit annoying.",

The 'air margaritas' were strong and tasty. They may look small, but they're powerful. It was hard to choose from the menu because so much sounded wonderful. Ended up with chips and salsa, the habonaro salsa (major heat), chicken flautas, and a lunch special that was pretty much equivalent to a ham quesadilla. All so tasty! I didn't think we'd have time for dessert, but the sticky rice sans rice was calling to me.. Awesome way to end a meal- light, sweet, full of flavor. The fresh mango adds just enough sweetness to the dish. I could have eaten here everyday!",

    "text": "I stopped by for dinner this past Friday at 8pm.  We had a reservation for 7 people, we arrived on time and were ready to enjoy our first time at this restaurant.   The place had a good number of customers but was not packed.  The food was great! I cannot rave enough about the food  The only reason I am giving this place 3 stars is because of the horrible service.    When we arrived our waiter was nice and polite, though this quickly changed as our meal progressed.  Our waiter (gentleman with a pony tail) was visibly upset as 3 of us wanted to try the tasting menu while the other 4 ladies chose to order separate dishes.  We understood his initial issue, he was concerned about the fact that the tasting menu is composed of 14 items and are served progressively.  He clarified that the ladies order the tasting menu would finish eating last and the others would be stuck watching us eat.  The thing is, these ladies did not mind it at all, they encouraged us to order the tasting menu, they themselves could not order it as it includes seafood and they do not enjoy it. There was also a bit of a confusion as the waiter took a couple of the orders wrong, the ladies asked for \"carnitas taco\" and they brought out \"cochinita pibil.\"  They brought it out twice even though we clarified that they did not want cochinita, they wanted carnitas.  The waiter's attitude was horrible, it was simply not needed and very unexpected for a Jose Andres restaurant.  The rest of the wait staff was great, very friendly.  I must add that though there were 7 of us, we made sure to make it easier on the waiter by paying in cash and not making a fuss over anything.   Now to the food....it was AMAZING!!!!! 14 delectable dishes!! the steamed bun was one of my favorites, as was the dumpling.  The hearts of palm salad had a bit of a tang, that dressing was like crack! I also tried my friend's salad, the meat on that salad was sooooo tender! It was like biting into a cloud! I want it right now!!!  My least favorite dishes were the soup and the carnitas taco.  The soup was too fishy for my taste, I drowned it in chilli paste and it made it so much better.  As for the taco, there was no novelty in that dish.  The only thing about the taco that stood out was the chicharron, it was light and crispy, but besides that, I am totally ok paying less at my local mexican market.  I hope management takes my review into account when training the staff.  The horrible service made a dent into what could have easily been our best dining experience in Vegas.",

I'd eaten at Jaleo in DC before and was underwhelmed, so his much-heralded arrival in Vegas was greeted with a bit of a shrug from me.  I had no interest in going to the western outpost of Jaleo (when there are so many better tapas options in town) but I was intrigued by the concept of China Poblano. And it did not disappoint.  Joined by two friends, we ordered a sampling of dishes from both sides of the menu - but the thing that sticks in my mind the most is the cocktail I ordered, the \"lemon drop soup.\" Vodka, citrus and noodles. Yes, noodles. In a drink. The \"salt air\" margarita was no less creative, and the \"cold tea\" of green tea, tequila and beer is just out there.  The absolute best dish I ordered here was the guacamole - it's $15 for an order (served with warm, fresh corn tortillas) but OH EMM GEE it's good. Special trip good. Take out window late at night good. And they'll make it as spicy as you want - always a plus for me.  Of all the dishes I've had, the only one I didn't love was the rainbow congee. Aside from that, pure unadulterated awesomesauce. The Mongolian beef is a New York strip. The sui mai dumplings contain gold leaf. The mole poblano tacos are morsels of joy.   But mostly that guacamole.",

He probably got the munchies and thought, damn I need to get me some greasy ass Chinese food or Mexican food.  It would be great if there was a place that served both. Bingo!  Then he sobered up the following day and created the menu as well as the prices.  It takes the clarity of corporate gluttony to take well-loved comfort food that is cheap and then charge more than 4 times the norm for it.  And it takes an idiot like me who will walk in and pay for it.  So I'm gonna call you out right here, Jose.  You have had me shell out tons of my hard earned money at your other establishments for fantastic cuisine that clearly distinguished you from your peers as well as served as an homage to your roots training under Adria Ferran of El Bulli. But you won't fool me again in ordering your f***g pathetic excuse of $25 fried rice. I felt like I was eating at Disneyland or at the airport.  Yes, I know that high quality ingredients adds cost.  But the food should taste better than the fried rice dish my sister made for me when she learned to cook at 9 years old..not an exact replica.  But the tacos here are pretty good, despite the sticker shock.  Chilaquiles are also good, but probably not as good as you mom made them, unless your mom was Chinese.  But that is what everything more or less tastes like here.  Mexican food like it was done by a Chinese chef, and Chinese food like it was done by a Mexican chef. Somewhat creative, good quality ingredients, but lacking the comfort that we expect these foods to provide.  But I would definitely not classify this place as fusion cuisine. It is more like what you get when you come across a Lousiana Fried Chicken - Hong Kong Express joint.    Just whatever you do, don't get the fried rice.  Curiosity killed the cat on this one.",

I am writing this review a few years late, but nonetheless I always remember the food I had here as the reason why Jose Andres is my favorite chef. The 20 veggie fried rice was phenomenal, especially with this really spicy hot sauce we tried. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. I also had the salt air margarita for the first time here which was really an inventive take on the traditional margarita. I loved it.",

    "text": "I have such fond experiences of eating here with my girlfriends when it first opened a few years ago, but my most recent visit wasn't nearly as delicious as I remembered. I don't know whether my taste has improved since my starving college student years or whether the restaurant has changed, but it was no longer the mind-blowing food I recalled.   We ordered the Golden Pigs, the Beef Shumai, Lobster Tacos, and for dessert, Mango Sticky Rice and Churros (we like dessert). The pigs were basically donuts filled with BBQ pork, and they were quite tasty when drenched with the accompanying condensed milk. The shumai weren't really anything to write home about, but the lobster tacos were the real disappointment! As my coworker put it, \"for $10 a taco, I expected them to taste good.\" The lobster was completely overwhelmed by an abundance of lime and grapefruit, making the tacos quite acidic and sour. The mango sticky rice was an interesting twist on the classic Thai dessert, as the rice was puffed and sprinkled on top of mango and ice cream which was covered in quite a lot of whipped cream. It was light and interesting, and I enjoyed it. The churros were nice but not particularly special.   Overall I'm a bit disappointed in the experience, and I hope they will start putting more effort into the food here.",

They don't even use special taco shells, its just regular tortilla tacos.  Viva China Taco (beef tendon/kumamoto oysters) $5.50  This taco was really unique. The beef tendon was dried and had the texture of really thin beef jerky. It was glazed in an asian flavor sauce. Served with ONE semi-raw oyster and seaweed. It was different but good.  Carnitas Taco $5.50 (braised baby pig, pork rinds, spicy salsa verde cruda)  This taco was basically filled with pulled pork. Topped with a spicy salsa that resembled spicy guacamole with chopped onions. Then two small pieces of pork rinds. It was good as well.  18 Monk Noodle $14.88 (hand cut wheat noodles, shiitake, crispy sweet potato, soy sauce)  Honestly, these noodles were kind of disgusting. First of all, it was a really tiny portion served in a large bowl. The noodles were completely over-sauced and drenched in soy sauce which made it salty. It was definitely not worth the price tag and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone!  Overall, we bought one bowl of noodles, and three tacos, and the bill came out to about $50. Not coming back here again.",

This place was no different.  The atmosphere was fun and had unique eye catching design elements.  The Negro Modelo was only $6 dollars which was cheaper than any other place.  We started with Chips and Guacamole for $15 which was good but I rather make my own.  I had a $5 Carnitas Taco with Pork Cracklings which was delicious.  I also had the Lucky 6 Pork Dumplings ($13.88)*, which had three different types with three different garnishes: Tobiko, Radish, & Gold Leaf.  The dumplings were overly salty and you can easily get better ones at any Chinatown restaurant.    I guess I was hoping that there would have been more fusion but instead it was just place to eat Mexican or Asian food.   *(Six and Eight are numbers in Chinese culture related to wealth)",

It's not fusion (for the most part) but a menu with Mexican and Chinese items side by side. With so many choices it was hard to pick, so we trusted the chef and went with the tasting tour with wine pairing, and we were glad we did. Pork belly tacos for one course, then bao balls the next. The back and forth from Mexico to China actually works on the pallet! It wasn't cheap, but it was one of those \"you get what you pay for\" nights because every dish was amazing and we were stuffed by the time we left.   A few Yelpers have complained about the service, but that wasn't our experience at all. We had a very attentive server and she had bussers clearing the table promptly after each course. The restaurant is small and can be noisy, so don't look here if you want quiet and romantic.",

Been to several of the places here (DOCG, Beauty and Essex, Eggslut and Henry) and this was right up there. It's a little stuck between casual and more upscale but for me that means pretty inclusive. It's termed a mix of Mexican and Chinese but leans more heavy Asian. What you notice upon entry is that they have two large areas for noodle, bun, egg roll and tortilla making from scratch. I sat at the bar since I was Lonely Guy traveling solo and got to watch the process of the bun and noodle making by hand. I was hoping for a TV to avoid awkward alone guy but it was fascinating seeing these guys make the doughs by scratch. That led me to try the steamed pork bun for appetizer. So awesome. I started out saying I would only eat one of the four large buns but ended up eating two and the filling of the other two. Perfect steamed texture and pork BBQ filling. Best Chinese invention since karate/Jackie Chan. Next I went with the Mongolian beef lettuce dinner. I thought it would be like a lettuce wrap but ended up being more like a steak salad but very tasty surprise. Beef was very tender with great soy sweet flavor on rope of smaller cut romaine that made my no carb desire a reality (you don't worry about the pork buns in the first part of this review - who are you- my Mom?). I didn't vary into many Mexican dishes but group at the bar Bessie me had queso and tacos and were very happy. Really good atmosphere with attentive bar tender who was just the right amount of chatty.  Try it if you like being interested.",

    "text": "Oh my, Chinese and Mexican fusion...I should have thought of that earlier. Despite how different the 2 cuisines might look, they have a lot of similarities.  We started with some drinks. I had the \"salt air\" margarita -- and oh my. This works a lot better than salt around the rim because you can just get a mouthful of the salt while drinking. The undesired effect is that you might get a \"milk mustache\" after you drink it, but hey, it's cute, right? Definitely a must-try if you like margaritas.  The food here is served in small plates, so it's a good idea to share everything so you get to try a bunch of stuff. We ordered quite a few things to share, and some of them, unfortunately, were on the saltier side (smoking chef?), but other than that everything tasted good.  Of all the things, I recommend trying the siu mai (thin skin, delicious pork), the chile en nogata (the walnut cream really made the dish) and the lamb potstickers (it's got that crispy lace which is oh so hard to make!). They have a few items with the Shirley Lee family XO sauce, but I'm not a fan of that...I prefer other brands' XO sauce much better. If you like handmade noodles, you might want to try them here too -- while they're not the best I've had, they were hearty and rustic, and will surely win a few hearts.  Overall, it's a very interesting place where you can get the best of both worlds. When you're surrounded by all different sorts of restaurants in Vegas, it's nice to see something different.",

    "text": "Another disappointing dining experience at a Jose Andres restaurant. If you want to pay for overpriced, bland food and horrible service, look no further!  Since my friend and I were starving when we got to the Cosmo, and China Poblano was open, I decided to set aside my reservations and negative associations about Jose Andres restaurants and give it another shot. However, I wasn't surprised when I didn't love the food. Since it was around 2:30pm on a Saturday, there were only a few other tables occupied and we were sat immediately. I tried:  -Carnitas Taco (Braised Baby Pig, Pork Rinds, Spicy Salsa Verde Cruda, $5.50) & Silencio Taco (Duck Tongue, Fresh Lychee, $5.50) [<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/china-poblano-las-vegas-2?select=6eXGIf_eU7YK4rt55SedgA#6eXGIf_eU7YK4rt55SedgA%5D\">yelp.com/biz_photos/chin...</a>: I enjoyed the carnitas taco a lot more than the duck tongue one. The carnitas taco had good flavor, and the ingredients worked well together. The duck tongue and lychee combination created a slimy texture, and I wasn't a fan of the combination- skip! -Papas Fritas (Fried Potatoes w/Mole Poblano, Mexican Cream, Queso Fresco, $7, <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/china-poblano-las-vegas-2?select=6eXGIf_eU7YK4rt55SedgA#WqRIXfHzRhF3CnxRCVLazg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/chin...</a>): The mole sauce was really bland, and the potatoes were limp/soggy. There wasn't much flavor overall in this dish, and I definitely wouldn't order this again.  The worst part about dining here was the service- it was INCREDIBLY SLOW. For a restaurant that is mostly empty, slow service is just unacceptable! Our server disappeared a couple of times, and we had to flag down another random server so that we could get our drinks, check, etc. It also took them over 15 minutes to bring my friend's drink so we ended up just cancelling it- of course, the apologies were sparse at best. I will definitely not be dining here again, and will likely avoid all Jose Andres restaurants in the future.",

    "text": "When a place in Vegas offers Chinese-Mexican food, you expect it to be an artful blend of the two. This place does not offer that, but offers both Chinese food, and Mexican food.  Seated at the bar on a night when there weren't many patrons, I ordered a drink that contained dragonfruit, lychee, and jasmine green tea. Although those are three ingredients I love, they did not blend well together in this drink...perhaps because of the chosen alcohol? My boyfriend and I shared the carnitas tacos and the beef Sui Mai. He ordered the duck tongue and lychee taco for himself, and I ordered the Beijing glass. I am disappointed to write that nothing we ordered here was stellar, and everything was surprisingly subpar.  Growing up in Southern California, I know good Mexican food. Living the last three years in the Bay Area, I know good Chinese food. When you hear about a Chinese-Mexican restaurant, especially in the Cosmopolitan, especially owned by Jose Andres, you expect great fusion food. This is more of a place you go when one person in your party wants Mexican and the other wants Chinese, and unfortunately the food isn't worth the cost. Unfortunate, because this place is a little pricey.",

    "text": "I went for Restaurant Week 2017.  When restaurants give you a tasting menu to sample their menu during one of these experimental events I always expect to overpay and leave wanting more.  Yes, I will probably experience many of their most popular dishes, but at a minimalistic portion size. This meal was $40 for dinner and 9 courses.  The first few courses were exactly as I expected. I began with a very lackluster jijama-wrapped guacamole that was barely a bite size.  This was followed by a small shumai, although known for, seemed absolutely average.  The dumpling layer is cooked in-house which I respect, but the dish itself wasn't as good as many dumpling houses in the area.  The meals began growing on me though from the two starters forward.  The next dish was the tuna ceviche spoon - absolutely amazing.  I'm not sure how many come in a typical serving, but this dish looked beautiful and tasted even better.  There was so much going on in only a spoon-sized portion.  This was my favorite dish of the night. The next offering was the refreshing palmitos salad closely followed by the chicken taco.  The salad was a very nice palate cleanser with palm and grapefruit and came as in a considerable portion size that would rival a typical salad starter.  The taco was cooked very well, with the notorious guacamole that China Poblano is known for, but not a must have.  Next was one of my top choices of the night - the golden pig.  Delicious pork belly filling with a hard bun.  I was expecting more of a steamed bun so I was caught off guard when I was served this bun, but still a very good dish.  The inside was fantastic and the outside with a dessert type of coating was very refreshing.  The final two dishes were the fried rice known across the strip and the shrimp mojo.  The shrimp had a little kick a very nice garlic sauce, but the size was very small.  The fried rice, on the other hand, was two times as large as you'd expect.  20 vegetables (I didn't count but there were a lot) and fluffy sticky rice make this dish a must.  After this meal I took home my leftover rice and easily I can make a meal and a half.  The dish was perfectly cooked and when mixed was perfection.  The night ended with a very tasty \"mango sticky rice\" for dessert, though it seemed more whipped cream than mango.  Good, but I'd rather get full on the main dishes than the dessert.  I really think the Chinese side of China Poblano outshines the Mexican.  Besides the ceviche, I enjoyed the bun and rice options much better.  The prices are high at this restaurant but know that Jose Andres rarely disappoints.",

    "text": "We went in cold after passing by during a recent stay at the Cosmopolitan. I guess I deserve what I got for not doing any research. The restaurant name hints at Fusion, though if I had done any reading I would have realized that the restaurant is not positioning itself as fusion style but rather as Chinese and Mexican side by side. This is a good idea, as it can satisfy groups of people with multiple cravings or be a good settler in a \"where to eat\" article.   Surroundings were nice, though the heavy stools with no handles have to be coaxed out from under the table and are on the uncomfortable side. Not a place to linger for long in my opinion as it is not relaxing ergonomically.   Waitstaff was friendly and attentive, though the \"we're Tapas style and recommend 2-3 dishes per person\" line they volunteer in advance to all diners, seems to ring as more of a minimum spending request, than it does as a guide to dining satisfaction. Each \"Tapa\" runs an average of $15-$17. The one negative in the service area was the busboy who was almost OCD in his desire to rush unfinished plates off the table. I had to finally tell him that we would let him know when we were done with a plate.  Okay, so if the food were good, the nitpicky items above may not have even been mentioned. Sadly it is not. The Spring Rolls were greasy and mushy inside. The dipping sauce actually made it more unpleasant. The Lamb Postickers seemed like a great idea and were set up fine texturally, but the heavy handed cumin made it seem as if I were eating a cumin dumpling, not lamb....and I like cumin. The Beef Siu Mai was non-descript and forgettable. The Chicken Lettuce Wraps were so underportioned for the price with tiny and sparsely placed chicken bits, that this is where I began going from \"not the best place\" to \"I'm a sucker.\" The Glass Noodles with Chicken featured the same chicken bits and was somewhat over salted, but we did actually enjoy it, though it was the final dish and we were already a big jaded.   $120 later with tip and tax. The kicker here is that Jose Andres' name is what sold us entering the place. Now I realize that just like Wolfgang Puck, the name is not a guarantee for a great meal. Gems for restaurants with duds sprinkled in. This one is ....a dud.",

Not a fusion by any means, the menu is split and offers an array of choices; small and large.  The immediate difficulty we had was understanding what the dishes were. The descriptions weren't easy to grasp. We ended up choosing four things to split, one of which the waiter suggested.   + The ambience was cool; lots to look at it, and it wasn't too loud.  + I had a glorified warm steak salad that was delicious. + All of the food came out in less than 15 minutes despite how busy they were.   - We weren't served water promptly. - Our waiter almost got our order wrong. Luckily I caught him as he was entering it in the computer. - The shrimp ceviche was bland and needed more acidity.  - The noodle dish that our waiter recommended was nothing special, it was actually better a few hours later when we reheated it.   This goes down as an average place to eat on the strip. Not overpriced, but not amazing either.",

I think it set the mood all wrong.  $5 for ONE taco $8 for FRENCH FRIES the size of an in n out fries. $12 for a bowl of SOUP/POSOLE  Then we were like screw it we are hungry so we are just going to order. The restaurant is located in Cosmo on the second floor I believe. It's casual but pricey. Half the restaurant is Asian cuisine and the other half is Mexican. We came in cause it looked casual and the ambience was nice and colorful casual informal unlike many of the other eateries in Cosmo.   Food was average not that great for my expectations of a $5 taco and $8 fries. French fries were just whatever in a small basket with a mole taste like soy sauce dipping sauce. We asked for ketchup. NO KETCHUP?? But you serve fries I just don't understand.   Soup was all right. Posole. Usually I like posole but this one was Okay. Had to add a bunch of limes.   The Hawaiian heart of Palm salad was unique. My mom liked it cause she has never had it.   Overall would not come back again.  Only nice thing was that the man gave us a disclaimer that everything was tapas style.   I love tapas but here is not the place to eat when you're hungry and want good food worth your buck.",

The bean taco was way better! For 4 tacos and a beer, our total came to over 30 dollars. That is pretty steep.  We've been here before too. Husband ordered a taco, and we shared the chilaquiles. Those were out-of-this-world good! It's a little too much to eat alone so it's good to share.",

Unlike other fusion style restaurants, the each item was True to its origin (ex: no elote dimsum or char siu tacos). We started with chips and salsa, the salsa had a roasty flavor and was very good. I had the traditional siu mai and the \"when pigs fly\" steamed buns, both were amazing and I ordered another traditional siu mai. My Husband had 3 tacos with carnitas and he loved those. Our service was great as well! Can't wait to come back here when we stay at the cosmo next time",

This place is yet another Jose Andres creation in which he utilizes his flare and unique spices blending to create a flavor explosion on your palate. I wouldn't say this is necessarily he best in Jose's lineup as some of the menu items would be considered average or below... The tacos are pretty decent (al pastor has the best taste) but really tiny in portion, the posole is decent but not great, dim sum is average, ceviche was well below average with a funky taste, the chips & guacamole was delicious and the Mexican gin and tonic was amazing. Overall, this place is worth a shot if you're looking for something new and different but if you're looking for large portions and absolutely delicious cuisine, I'd look elsewhere...   Pros- Location Service  Chips and Guac  Mexican gin and tonic  Unique concept  Nice ambiance and decor  Cosmo Identity points   Cons- Price per portion ratio not good  Average food taste  Funky seating  Dim sum",

    "text": "I really enjoyed our dining experience here. If I could live on a diet of  just salt air margaritas, I would.  What a delightful concoction! We went for more of a Mexican feast than Chinese, so here is the breakdown.  The Tacos:  Pancita al Pastor (slow-cooked pork belly/ pineapple) - Great play on flavors. The pork belly had good crispness to it and complemented the pineapple.   Viva China* (soft beef tendon/ Kumamoto oyster/scallions/ Sichuan peppercorn sauce) - My husband's favorite. Great fusion taco. The tendon was cooked just right.   Silencio (duck tongue/ fresh lychee) - Neither of us had tried duck tongue before, so we had to try it. FANTASTIC! The sauce had a bit of spice to it that really made work.   Barbacoa de Res (Oaxacan-style barbeque beef/guajillo chile/ pickled cactus paddle) - The was a big taco filled with flavorful barbacoa and nopales. I'm not sure if it was worth the price, but it was tasty.   Carnitas (braised baby pig/pork rinds/ spicy salsa verde cruda) - This was the favorite of the night. The carnitas were perfect, but the addition of the pork rinds really made this taco off the chain! We could have eaten 10 of these.   The Rest: Huitlacoche Noodles (wild mushrooms/ fresh Mexican corn truffle/ knife-shaved noodles) - The huitlacoche actually worked well in this dish. I wasn't sure going in, but felt adventurous. The noodles were cooked perfectly. This is a dish that is big enough to share. This dish was surprisingly spicy, so beware.   Queso Fundido (melted chihuahua cheese/tequila blanco/fresh tortillas...with chorizo) - TASTY! Maybe a bit expensive. It reminded me of being with family in Mexico and eating fresh tortillas off of the comal with cheese.   Mango Sticky Rice - The was actually a cream of sweet rice on top of Mango shave ice topped with crispy rice (think rice krispies) and fresh mango. Very refreshing!   Our server was attentive and the manager even came by the see if we were satisfied. Overall, we had a pleasant dining experience.",

    "text": "This time, we dined inside the restaurant for some of the tastiest, most exciting dishes I've tried recently. Our server was extremely knowledgeable on the entire menu and quick to offer suggestions. It was a little awkward hearing the waitstaff explain to each table that the portion sizes for some dishes are very small (i.e. dim sum), but fair warning, as the prices are a bit steep. But if you're willing to pay for quality, China Poblano certainly delivers.  All the food was executed perfectly. I enjoyed the huitlacoche quesadilla with chihuahua cheese that was featured as a chef's special that night. The signature 20 vegetable fried rice was something like a garden party in a bowl, with baby carrots and greens sprouting from the top. Each bite brought a new vegetable surprise: snap peas, several varieties of mushrooms, crunchy jicama, cauliflower, carrots shaped like flowers, and easily silenced my usual complaint that fried rice never contains enough vegetables. And, as to that dessert I'd been waiting to try, the mango \"sticky rice\"  was as fantastic as I'd anticipated. I'm a big fan of the traditional Thai version, but I'll dream about this coconut custard, sweet cubes of mango with lime zest, and whipped coconut cream topped with caramelized crispy rice, all perfectly complemented by the crunch of the mango granita hidden inside. I will definitely be back for more.",

I had heard so much about  culinary genius, Jose Andres and that is the reason I even went into the restaurant after perusing the menu.  If it was not associated with Jose Andres, I would have immediately done a 180 after seeing the $11.00 price tag on a serving a dim sum.    Jose Andres is known for his tapas servings and so our group ordered a number of tapas servings to share.  And they were just OK.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't mind blowing either.  If I am paying $8 for a mini mini pork sandwich- it BETTER blow my mind, and it did not.  My favorite dish was the eggplant dish, but it wasn't fabulous enough for me to return. I even tried eating the Chinese dish and Mexican dish, side by side to see if that would make a difference in the \"experience\", but it didn't.  In fact, I still don't get it.  It was not a fusion restaurant, but rather two menus in one.   The ambience is cool and trendy, but next time I am considering Mexican or Chinese, I will definitely go elsewhere, where the flavor satisfaction matches the price.  I can get ambience elsewhere.",

Chinese and Mexican small plates is the name of the game here. They have a healthy list of tacos. Being a self-appointed taco aficionado, this was a welcomed sight. Unfortunately, the two I tried (Viva Chine & Carnitas) missed a mark a bit, but were still solid. However, when you are dropping five bucks on a taco, you are looking for a bulls-eye. The tuna ceviche, on the other hand, was dynamite. I am not a huge ceviche fan, but the server recommended it, so we gave it a whirl. Marcus was dead-on with this suggestion. We also tried the 20 vegatable fried rice, which was alright. Overall, the dishes were interesting and varied in tastiness. The food was quality and intriguing enough to warrant another visit sometime in the future.",

    "text": "When I saw China Poblano on Food TV's \"Best Thing I Ever Ate: Las Vegas,\" I knew we had to go when we were out there. It's a restaurant designed for us, really - Mexican and Chinese. Not fusion, but three separate kitchens taking care of both of our food needs at once, without one of us sitting and watching the other eat. Being that it was Jose Andres, we had high hopes, and they were met easily.  His plate: Papas Fritas with Mexican cream and queso fresco; Carnitas taco (braised baby pig, pork rinds, spicy salsa verde cruda); Pescado Frito taco (fried fish, salsa Mexicana)  Her plate: \"When Pigs Fly\" - delicate steamed buns with Chinese barbecue pork; \"Ocean Nest\" - scallops/shrimp/king crab/lobster/pan-fried egg noodles/ seasonal vegetables; \"Salt Air Margarita\"  To share: Chips and Salsa - fresh tortilla chips, house-made chipotle salsa  The chips and salsa were good, though nothing out of this world. The pork buns were the only actually disappointing part of the meal - the dough is a little gummy and maybe overworked - though the filling was flavorful and moist, and happily not over-salty. We ended up taking these home and they were better as cold leftovers in the middle of the night.  My pan-fried egg noodles were nice and crisp, with a deliciously oceany broth. There was no king crab, which I'd been looking forward to, but the shrimp had their heads on and were fantastically fresh. The bok choy was the perfect choice for the 'seasonal vegetable' and I'd definitely get this dish again. The ocean flavor was just so good.  The fries were described as good, but not memorable. D's tacos were both fantastic, full of flavor and great textural contrasts. The carnitas were not slimy, as they are at some restaurants, and were nicely accented by the pork rinds on top. Since we've been home, the tacos have been mentioned a few times. We'd love it if Jose added a China Poblano in DC, but we'll also definitely visit it again when we're in Vegas next year.",

    "text": "We dined here before heading to Marquee and I'm almost positive the outcome would've been more satisfactory had we gone anywhere else. Price and portion aside, the food wasn't that good. The shu mai making skills of the expressionless Chinese women in the open kitchen was extremely robotic, but it was really interesting to watch. They've reached the highest peak of their mastery of dumplings and now they look bored. There was no interaction between the cooks and bar occupants. At least you can confirm the food's authentic.  My bf and I wanted to taste a couple to start so we ordered 3 items and the couple with us went crazy and ordered 10. They gave my plate to them which ended up sitting on the side with their other 5 plates and so mine got cold before they corrected the mistake. That was also realized only after I inquired the whereabouts of my shu mai. The waitress was going to set my food down, then was stopped in her tracks by a manager(?) who ended up swapping the dish with our friend and then I finally ended up with my plate...which was now missing a dumpling. It's not a big deal since it was our friend who ate a shu mai thinking it was hers but I can't believe that's how the staff handled it. Anyway, the dish fell flat for me. I wouldn't have been able to tell the difference eating supermarket frozen shu mai. My bf ordered an expensive taco and ceviche that was pretty good but any slightly positive thought of the food was overshadowed by the bill and my still empty stomach. We could get this food better at any block in Santa Ana. It would be ridiculous to spend a hundred bucks on mediocre food just to get full. At the end, we decided to cut our losses and not order anymore. They did succeed at visual appeal because the place looked incredible.",

    "text": "I loved this place! The atmosphere is fun and exciting. Ok, for all of you complaining about prices...really? You expect to spend $1.50 on a taco in the cosmopolitan? Seriously? This is not the place. The prices are not outrageous for Cosmopolitan prices. You pay for location.  Must haves: Salt Air Margaritas!!!! These were divine. The salt foam is interesting in a good way. Our table could not stop ordering them. Sui Mai! Small, but DELICIOUS and they have gold flakes. Come on! Gaucamole - spicy, but exceptional quality great with tortillas or the chips Queso Fundido was good, but not over the top delicious Viva China taco Scallop Ceviche! These come out as little scallop shooters on half limes. You shoot the scallop and squeeze the lime with the spices on it. SO GOOD. Along with the margaritas these were our favorite of the evening. When Pigs Fly - Great pork buns, better than most dim sum I've had. Not too much bread.  Meh: Lobster taco - didn't care for it Porkbelly taco - too much sauce! Ten Treasure - too little flavor compared to everything else  Overall great place even just for a drink (margarita) and a snack. I would love to come back and order the scallop ceviche again!",

The Langosta (lobster) taco's were OK. I don't think it was worth it for the price.   The tacos are the size of Mexican street tacos so order a few to taste.   The Beijing Glass noodles is a yummy cold noodle dish w/ veggies. I found it refreshing. The avocados on top were a good mix.   I also had the Har Gau dumplings. The outside of the dumpling was good, dumplings must be freshly made, but I thought the inside could use a little more taste.   Overall, this is a pretty good place for higher end China/Mex. It's tough to find a China Mex restaurant anyway.",

I don't even remember what I paid for 2 pork belly al Pastors.   I have eaten her 2x. Once in a hurry before entering Marquee and last  week in no rush for a late lunch. The place was calm and somewhat empty so we got great service.   Sure they hand make dim sum here but I think they are creating dim sum for elves/fairies! I needed a microscope to see my siu mai. They are packed with flavor but not worth $14 for 6 TINY pieces.   I think they need to work on their portions and maybe hire some dim sum chefs from the bay area. They are on point with the tacos so I won't ding em there. Just be prepared to pay a pretty penny for food that costs next to nothing at home.   Vegas tip: Order from the to-go window if you're roaming around the hotel and try the tacos. Don't forget to order a beer!",

This time I ordered from the Weekly Specials menu because there was an item I've seen before and heard about before but, had not tried, and it is only on this menu on occasion. I believe it was added to the Specials menu because it is a traditional Mexican treat that is designed with the colors of the Mexican flag, which are green red and white.  Mexican Independence Day is this week.  It's the Chiles en Nogada!    The dish consists of a poblano chili stuffed with a \"picadillo,\" which is usually meat spice and fruit.  In this case, it was pork.  the whole thing is covered with a creamy walnut sauce and topped with pomegranate seeds!  It was the best meal I've had all week!",

This is more like a 3.5 star place but I'm rounding up because the service was really good.  In any case, there were 4 of us and we were sat quickly.   It's a tapas-style restaurant that serves dim sum and mexican dishes.  Odd, I know but it works at this casual, unique, hip establishment.  We ordered:  Chips and Salsa - the Salsa was really good!  Good heat but not super hot... just great flavor.  Papas Mole - These were 'ok'.... french fries with mole sauce.  Chilaquiles - BEYOND YUM!  These are the reason I'd go back again.  Melty, crunchy, with just the right amount of \"spice\" ... but it wasn't \"spicy\" per se... it was just lots of great flavor!  :)  When Pigs Fly - not bad but I don't think I'd order them again... were rather plain  Carnitas Tacos - YUM!  Definitely would get these again  Lengua Taco - I didn't try these but the guy who ate it really liked it",

Our eyes were definitely bigger than our stomachs because we also ordered the fresh guacamole and chips, beans, cheese, chips, pork bao, and the mongolian beef.  There were lots of ooos and ahhs from our table as these foods were comforting and all so tasty!  We were so impressed!  I can't wait to come back here again next time I am in Vegas!!",

The fried rice on the other hand was extremely good and the presentation was awesome as well. It had loads of mini sized veggies throughout. We like spicy so we asked for a side of hot sauce. They brought out some very spicy original hot sauce which helped add some kick.",

    "text": "Allow me to preface, i seldom give 1 or 2 stars: A lot had to be missing for any dining establishment to fall in this category.   it was a saturday night at the Cosmopolitan Hotel & Casino.  H and I were in a hurry to grab a quick bite before heading to the Marquee Night club.  The cafe would surely prepare a hearty meal, but as the minutes ticked away, we knew that time was not on our side.  Luckily (or unluckily in this case) China Poblano jumped out of nowhere and had a sign that said \"to go or take out.\"  instantly, i'm thinking it's kinda like Taco Bell fast, but let's just say that we're lucky to get our food in less than 20 minutes.  the menu was a fusion of chinese and mexican food.  unique? not really.  anybody can make any type of meat and throw it in a tortilla shell and call it mexican food.  anybody creating this type of concept needs to think it through to create a unique dining experience for everyone who passes through the doors.  come'on, people travel from all over the world to come to vegas.  is this is best meal the Cosmo can offer?  i believe not.  THE PORK SIU MAI were a disgrace to Chinese people who invented this dish.   i have eaten this all my life in OC & LA & even SF and have never seen anything so tiny.  it was literally the size of a quarter, all 6 of them, looking pretty sad and lonely in this takeout container that it was tossed into.  no shredded lettuce or cabbage for garnishment.  just 6 puny little siu mai's squished to the corner of the container.  i finished them in 2 minutes and naturally was not full at all.  the taste -- it was ok, not spectacular.  THE TACOS that H had were another dismal dish that appeared from the same menu.  i can't quite comment on the taste but the size was disappointing.  the prices.... were not cheap. both microscopic & macroscopic items came in slightly less than $30.  what?  does money grow on trees?  Asians are taught to get the best bang for the buck and to bargain our way through life... this time i felt jipped & helpless.  left the establishment with a more than half empty stomach & feeling robbed.  THE EXPERIENCE: ok, granted we order takeout, but there was no place to sit outside in the hallways of the hotel.  it's just not sexy or classy to eat in the hallways.  meanwhile inside, the bar was completely empty (as in zero, zip, zilch, nada patrons).  We asked the girl cleaning the bar if we could please sit there for a few minutes, and she said yes. then, like a bat out of hell, the hostess stormed over and said we cannot sit there.  what?  did you not realize we were not fighting for seats but actually making your establishment appear fuller than it is?  so, she escorted us to these benches behind the bar with pillows that we could sit in.  for all the commotion that she caused by moving us, we could've finished our food in the 2 minutes that it requires to consume our so-called meal.  IN CONCLUSION: this place is not suitable in such a gorgeous hotel as the Cosmopolitan.  it does not compare to its elegance, its grandeur, and its sophistication.  the people who work there need to grace better manners and accommodate its patrons a little better.  i would highly suggest you save your money and go to the cafe downstairs or win a couple of hands in blackjack and eat at Blue Ribbon Sushi or STK instead.",

There's nothing thats Mexican AND Chinese - nothing like carnitas filled steamed buns or wonton tacos. You know what I mean.... The only thing that was edible is the Twenty Vegetables fried rice.  Their wonton noodle soup is meh. My friend's Mongolian beef is so strange - it's more like salad with little pieces of beef tossed over it. Ha ha  Anyways, service is okay and I still need to figure out why they overcharged my debit card...not very happy with this. Tsk",

    "text": "BOOOOOOOOOO! There has always been a hype about this place... but it's just another one of Vegas' overpriced ethnic food attempt... sigh.  The first thing I wondered about this place was... why the combination of Chinese and Mexican?  I was hoping to find out why, but I left the restaurant still confused.  I was leaving Vegas at noon, so my friend and I squeezed in a meal here to find out what the hype was about.  Unfortunately it was a brunch menu so we didn't have much to choose from.  Besides the fact that there weren't much to choose from the menu which didn't really bother me that much, the first thing I noticed was... there was no fusion between the Chinese and Mexican food.  (I actually got to take a look at the full menu later but the only thing that was kind of fusion was a taco or two where they used some Chinese ingredients... but didn't sound too appetizing)  So to try both Chinese and Mexican, I got the breakfast taco and a Chinese pork sandwich.  Breakfast taco wasn't that great.  The pork inside the pork sandwich was good... but it's pork fat, of course it's going to be good.  After a few bite of the pork sandwich, the sauce overpowered the taste of the pork so much that I couldn't even finish it.  I am a little disappointed because I LOVE the Cosmopolitan hotel and everything I've done there have been awesome~  I can't say the same about China Poblano!",

So during my last Vegas adventure, the girls and I stopped in to China Poblano...the beautiful baby of when Mexico and China do it.  The decor was cute. Not only a mix of Chinese and Mexican iconography, it was also a mix of casual and a tad more upscale. The staff was friendly and on point.  Quick with the smiles and the conversation.  But the real pride of the litter was the food.  We ordered: Guacamole When Pigs Fly Beijing Glass Tuna Ceviche Mexican Mimosa  It was all fantastic.  First of all, the guacamole was flavorful, smooth and had enough kick to make the table of Latinas eating it nod in appreciation. When Pigs Fly (pork buns) were fluffy and rivaled the traditional buns I've had. Beijing Glass was zesty and refreshing. Mexican mimosa was refreshing with just the right bitch slap of booze to make it interesting.  But they all were dwarfed by the sheer awesomeness that was the Tuna Ceviche.  There were so many textures, flavors and spices that we all could barely contain ourselves!  It was the perfect marriage of Mexican spice and Chinese textures...exactly what this place is all about.    Next time I go to Vegas (it will be soon) I'm going back to see my little half breed one more time.",

I don't normally like salted rims on my margaritas because I don't like the texture, but this salted foam was a nice, innovative way to infuse that flavor without the crunchiness. Perfect balance of sweet and citrus with enough punch. The Singapore Sling was also really well done, I could drink those all day. The lengua taco was small, but very soft and juicy.",

Either way, both lunch and snacks here were great.   So good that I broke a rule and ate there twice on a four day work trip.  Highly recommended.",

Though we had 5 different people bring out food to us, it felt like they were understaffed or the manager just didnt have the experience to get everything right though it looked like they were working their asses off.   Some of the food didnt even taste that great, I didnt like my mushroom noodles and could eat only half of it.   They should stop making it look or feel like a classy restaurant and just deliver tasty food faster, just like they try to make it look. ( Street style chinese and mexican food )",

Silly me for expecting more than 3 bites for the $8.88 price tag. It wasn't good. It was so soupy it had sogged thru the bun and takeout box! it was salty and beyond messy.   Fun fact: While waiting for our food right by the take out window, a girl projectile vomited all over their cute little lounge chairs. The hostesses (more than one!) didn't even turn their heads when it was happening, I had to wave them down to do something about it! Should have taken that as a bad omen.",

    "text": "Located in The Cosmopolitan - I have to say what first caught my eye about this place was their viewing window where I could see them making pork buns, and also the fact it said there was take out. Pork buns + Take out = Win! (not quite what happened but probably would have gotten more stars had that been the case.)   Chinese cuisine + Mexican Cuisine = China Poblano. I'd say this is a fusion of the two but on the menu literally its two separate cuisines you can order from, no mingling at least not that my eyes could see.   Order consisted of:  When Pigs Fly (4 pieces) - steamed pork buns $13.88 Dan Dan Mian - wheat noodles with spicy pork sauce $12.00 Lychee Sour - yummy drink $12.00   So our waitress warned us that portions were small and that we should most likely order multiple things hence my pork buns and noodle dish. The pork buns to me were correctly portioned, I split the order with a friend thankfully because she had ordered a single $10 Lobster Taco and $14 Tuna Ceviche. The waitress really wasn't lying on small portions I give her credit for her honesty.   The food was overall pretty good. I loved the flavor of the meat in the pork buns but was a little turned off by the meat being lukewarm/cold. My noodle dish was the kind of spicy I enjoy but I had to \"pace\" myself with the small dish swimming in a large bowl (I didn't understand this presentation, the lets make our portions look even smaller with using larger serving bowls?). The lychee sour, was probably my favorite part of the whole meal. It was a different type of cocktail, tangy yet sweet, and oh how I love lychee.  Overall a bit pricey for my taste given it wasn't anything overly special or wow factor. Perhaps I'd order the steamed pork buns again from the take out window given I could request the meat be a little more on the warm side.",

The prices, portions, excessive use of salt and sugar? To start off I ordered chips and salsa. When the chips and salsa arrived I was excited to try the salsa since it looked dark and spicy (I'm Mexican and this resembled the salsa I make at home). WRONG!!!!! This salsa tasted so sweet it was such a disappointment. For my main entree I ordered two tacos one of which was the carnitas and the other was chicken. The carnitas was excessively greasy and the chicken taco was again very sweet. My fiance ordered the shrimp poblano which was again extremely sweet. I understand not all Mexican food is made the same but the food at this particular restaurant tasted very foreign to me.   Not to mention they played a lot of bachata music which is not Mexican at all!! However, since there were tons of white people dining here they wouldn't know the difference.   In conclusion, I was very disappointed with my meal and since the prices are not fair for the quality of the food I will not be coming back to this restaurant nor will I recommend this place to my family or friends!",

Tacos and Noodles (especially the noodle soups) just dont seem worth it to me to pay those extra bucks. I understand that it is by Jose Andres, and I understand that its expensive, and I understand that its meant to be in small portions, and I understand that its suppose to be gourmet-esque, a cream of the crop type of ideal. BUT... I just dont see the possibility of tacos and noodle soups being capable of elevated at that high of a level. Its like taking something wayyy out of its comfort zone and making it work.   Long story short, the food is delicious, the prices are pretty high, the portions are very small, the location is very convenient for those staying in the Cosmopolitan.   Will I ever eat here sober? NO Will I ever eat her inebriated? YES  UNTIL THEN!! ^-^",

    "text": "This review is for their four-course 2017 Las Vegas Restaurant Week lunch menu.  Believe the hype. This place is freaking delicious, and their Las Vegas Restaurant Week lunch menu is a bargain and the best way to sample what the restaurant has to offer.  First course: Sui Mai trio - I loved this sampler of shrimp and pork, scallop and beef and lime sui mai. Flavorful and aromatic. It was like a party in my mouth.  Second course: Happy Buddha Vegetable Spring Roll - Crispy and jam packed with fresh veggies and noodles. Made-in house and doesn't take like the frozen variety that's sometimes found at restaurants and buffets in this area. Legit.  Third course: Ants Climbing a Tree - Oodles of cellophane noodles galore with sesame seeds, chicken, and bok choy that'll give your taste buds a spicy kick.   Fourth course: Mango Sticky Rice - This isn't your traditional mango sticky rice dish. The rice and coconut are and blended together to creamy perfection and topped with toasted Rice Krispies. Dig in and you'll find sweet, cool chunks of mango inside. How they did that, I have no freaking idea, but it was delicious. I needed four more of these.  Overall: This is one spot I'd return to, Restaurant Week or not.",

    "text": "I'll probably never be coming back to this restaurant. For the price, the food is subpar and there are far better options in Vegas. It's a waste of stomach space and money to eat here.    The first red flag was the lack of service. The host told us we could be seated immediately at the bar but instead she decided to seat 2 other parties before I had to remind her. Instead of seeming apologetic, she instantly became annoyed and rudely showed my party to our seats. Then we waited apporimently 10 minutes before any of the staff acknowledged us. Lastly, we had 3 different waiters through the entire meal; none of which seemed to care at all.   The waiter warned us the portion sizes were small but I did not expect to receive half a child's meal. I ordered two entrees which was over 25 bucks and left hungry. No exaggeration, I went to grab a snack after because I'd probably need another 3 portions to feel full. In all seriousness prepare to expect roughly 1/4 of what a normal restaurant might give you.  Overall the taste was just okay. It was palatable but not very good in terms of Vegas standards. My girlfriend and I ordered noodles, baos, and other Asian dishes which were either too sweet or just poorly excuted.   My advice is to just avoid this place. If youre in Vegas just don't come here.",

    "text": "Disappointing!  Service is slow and inattentive but it might be because we sat outside on the patio area. The food was completely overpriced. I thought it would be a fusion food type of place but it's literally a restaurant that sells mexican food and chinese food on a menu.  Chips, Salsa, nd guacamole - guacamole is an additional $16 in addition to the $5 chips and salsa. Whattt the hell- $16? Note: It's one of those places where the waiter/ waitress awkwardly makes the guac in front of you. I mean, don't get me wrong- the guac was delicious but no quac is worth $16.  Cochinita Taco- $6 Saddest cochinita taco I've ever eaten. The barbeque sauce was just too sweet and the pickled onions didn't taste like anything. Carnitas Taco - $6 This was actually really good. It came with chicharron, which gave the taco some texture. The verde salsa was good, and the onion was thinly sliced but crispy. The highlight of my meal here. Lucky 6 sui mai- $14 there's traditional (shirmp & pork), beef, and scalloped sui mai. This plate- just no. They're teeny tiny and too salty. Literally bite sized. Maybe it's because I'm used to legit Dim Sum from the SGV but come on. Pozole Rojo - My husband said it liked this dish. I don't eat pozole often so it's hard for my to give my two cents but I found it to be a bit too salty. There was quite a lot of meat in it, but the dish just had way too much going on.  Overall- PASS. Spend your money on some other overpriced Vegas food that will at least taste good.",

Had the pea leaf salad (good but tasted like every other Asian house salad you can get anywhere), Sui Mai trio (best thing we had most likely), crispy Buddha spring rolls (they were egg rolls), asparagus, twenty vegetable fried rice (tasted like regular fried rice), and the Ants on a Log (pretty good spicy cellophane noodles) but nothing stuck out as amazing. The Siu Mai was extremely tiny but the most flavorful.  Our dessert was the best part of the night. Got the churro which was okay and came in a glass of hot chocolate. But the mango sticky rice was a mango jelly with cinnamon Rice Krispies(?), and cream. Bomb.   Also everything was dressed with wilted watercress and the plates were very small. Our server Angie was very nice as well.   Tip: if you want a better table, I would request ahead of time. We were seated somewhere else and asked to move, there's a lot of hidden corners in the restaurant that wouldn't be good for entertaining.",

    "text": "So I found myself wondering the hotel looking for food after a very long morning of meetings. I had heard about China Poblano but couldn't totally wrap my head around Chinese Mexican fusion. But extreme hunger and the lure of the fluorescent pink sign outside lured me in to give it a shot.  I walked over to the hostess still a little unsure of what I was getting myself involved with. She sat me at the bar and highly recommended trying the chef's experience since I was solo. I explored their menu and looked over the Chef's experience menu and decided that I would go with her recommendation.  First and foremost let me just tell you for $45.00 this is about as much as a bargain as you will find food wise on the strip! There was so much  food!!! Initially when I looked over the menu I thought that I was going to have to choose an item from each of the sections on the menu, it wasn't until I saw someone else sitting near me eating that I realized I get EVERYTHING from the Chef's Experience menu. Holy Moly!!!!!  My waiter suggested a great cocktail that wasn't on their regular drink menu, I am stoked that I went with his suggestion and tried this absolutely amazing cocktail. I can't remember exactly what was in the drink but it was a crazy delicious cocktail that had hibiscus and tequila. If you go, I highly highly recommend trying this drink.   With the Chef's Experience I was served the following,  Chips & Salsa Tuna Ceviche Spoon Traditional Siu Mai Snow Pea Leaf Salad Carnitas Taco Shrimp Mojo Twenty Veggie Fried Rice  Mango Sticky Rice   I was initially served my chips and salsa, the salsa was pretty good. I was then served a single Siu Mai with gold leaf flakes on top. I wasn't blown away by the Siu Mai, but it was good but likely one of the more forgotten about parts of the meal.  The Tuna Ceviche Spoon was really well balanced and it had the right about of acid/salt and heat. My absolute favorite part of the meal was the Snow Pea Leaf Salad. It was just delicious. It consisted of Pea Shoots, Snow Peas, Orange, Lily Bulb, Walnuts, and Pomegranate Seeds with a sesame dressing. It was just so refreshing and well balanced that I will be going home to try to recreate this salad. The Carnitas taco was pretty good, the tortilla was delicious and the pork was super tender but I felt like it could have used a little more heat and maybe a little more cilantro. But that's my own personal preference. I like things a little spicy and I am a huge fan of cilantro. I put a little bit of the sauce that was served with my Siu Mai on my taco and I thought it added an interesting element to the taco. The Shrimp Mojo was also like the Siu Mai and was a little on the forgettable side. I felt like it really just fell flat flavor wise. The Twenty Veggie Fried Rice was really good, I LOVED how they put a bit of the Snow Pea Leaf Salad on top of the rice, It really lightened up the dish. The Mango Sticky Rice was the perfect way to end the meal. It was super refreshing and delicious.   I am honestly surprised that this place doesn't high a higher rating on yelp. From my experience it was really delicious and prices were on point. Service was a little spotty at times and I was stuck with multiple dirty plates in front of me during my coursing but those things are all easy to fix.  Next time I am in Vegas and not solo I will be back and am excited to see what delicious items they feature from their full menu.",

    "text": "We discovered China Poblano exploring the Strip the day before and decided to return for lunch today. It was a nicer, more casual spot without being too low key, unsophisticated for our style and palates.   We picked 2 cocktails to start, the unique twist on a classic, Mexican gin & tonic and a Jade Garden. Both were enjoyable.   For the meal we picked 2 from China, 2 from Mexico. Our favorite from the Lucky 6 Sui Mai was the beef with the traditional a close second. The scallop lack the flavor the others did. The steamed pork buns were spot on. The Caldo Talpeno soup had great flavor with a nice touch of heat. Our ceviche citrico was pleasant though was least exciting of the dishes we chose.   If we chose dessert, it would have been a full order of the beef Sui Mai.   We would definitely come back to explore more of the unique combinations and options.",

Both were awesome but I enjoyed my Flaca more!  We actually had to order two to go after our meal!  (Love Vegas!). And the food was equally delicious. We shared the hearts of palmitos salad (yummy) and the 20 vegetable fried rice.  As a vegetarian who doesn't eat anything spicy, I was thrilled with flavorful food that I could enjoy!  The service was also outstanding: friendly and knowledgeable.  Note: this is tapas style so portions are according which we appreciated since it seems that most American restaurants serve too large of portions.  And definitely try the churros for dessert!  Can't say enough about this restaurant!  We'll be back!!",

    "text": "This is hands-down my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas. The service is friendly and the food is amazing.   I grew up  eating home-cooked authentic Mexican food  and this place somehow not only matches but surpasses that experience !  If you are looking for good Mexican food this is the place ! My fave items so far: guac w/tortillas, tamale, ceviche, lotus chips, and tacos( my favorite tacos are the Carnitas and the napoles)  Some things are meant to be shared like the guac, ceviche, etc.  Others like tacos are more of an individual item.  The guac comes with tortillas which are delicious but I always get ceviche which comes with tortilla chips and I also get a side of lotus chips so I have an assortment of things to dip in my guac haha.     For chinese I reccomend the 20 vegetable fried rice.  I tend to stick to the Mexican side of the menu just because I love Mexican food haha but seriously you can't go wrong with anything on the menu here.    For dessert, I highly recommend the mango sticky rice, their rendition is so unique and delicious.  Everything is prepared in open Chef stations so you know they are keeping things clean!  The atmosphere is fun and casual.  I try to eat here every chance I can.  I still have so many more things I want to try!",

The $15 guacamole should have been a tip-off ... the waiter swore it was THAT good...so we gave it a try.  I'd say at best it might be slightly above average.  Unless its amazingly hard to truck an avacado into Las Vegas though, at $15 for an avacado, some lime, and a tomato they are making a killing on this dish.  Next up, salt and pepper tofu. This dish is best described as bland and unsatisfying. I love me some good tofu - but good this was not. Basically it was 4 pieces of tofu doused in corn starch and fried. Seasoned with some salt and pepper. There was a small chile garnish, but it was pretty bland and didn't give the tofu any flavor.  $12.88 for that gem of a dish. Disapointing.  The waiter raved about the famous fried rice, featured on food network, yada yada. I was really looking forward to it... It was ok. I appreciated that the vegetables were nicely, uniformly diced up for texture, but man it was HEAVY. Very greasy dish.  Again for $20 I expected something a bit more sophisticated.   My wife had Gan Pung Ji Chicken, which to her was a big bunch of averageness for $23.00.   Another annoying thing about this place is they bring your food out at random times. That meant my wife was done with her entree before I was even served mine. The waiter explained this was just how their restraurant worked. WHAT?! Why? It makes no sense. What kind of restraurant thinks that is normal?  Definitely would under no cirumstances eat here again. There are a lot of other choices in vegas that provide MUCH better food and MUCH better service at a MUCH better price.   To summarize, if you are in Vegas and want to throw away some money. You can either hit the tables or hit china pablano. The tables are a lot more fun and at least there is a chance you may come out ahead. At china pablano however you are gauranteed to be a loser.",

    "text": "As a concept, China Poblano is classic Jose Andres. The tapas-style menu is perfect for groups and a good selection of Mexican street food and Cantonese dim sum staples will offer something for everyone. However once price comes into the equation, things get a little worrying.  China Poblano does a few things very well. It's hip, casual atmosphere is right at home at the Cosmopolitan and the quick service and sharing nature of the food make it a good lunch spot.   The Good: China Poblano's tacos are easily the highlight of the menu. The braised beef barbacoa and chicken with chorizo are delicious options, but keep in mind they are quite small. The chilaquiles are another highlight with a bright tomatillo salsa and lots of melted cheese. The service was fast and friendly and the waitstaff were good about explaining each dish.  The Bad: For as good as their Mexican options are, China Poblano struggles more with the Chinese side of the menu. The Mongolian beef salad was described as lettuce wraps on the menu, only when it arrived we discovered that wasn't the case. The beef came laden with a corn syrup sheen found only at the very best bad Chinese spots and it was very tough to chew. The restaurant's prices are high, too high for what you're getting. China Poblano is clearly catered towards to street food crowd and over $6 for a taco (2-3 bites) is too much.  Andres is doing great things for gastronomy throughout the world and while the Mexican food at China Poblano is excellent, you pay a bit too much for the Andres stamp of approval.",

Then, while laughing my face off, JL said, \"no, it's your birthday\" (it was not). Let's just say that we did not get any free cake during our stay. The food was definitely not fusion.

The menu was nice and simple so it wasn't hard to make choices and things come out in small portions, so it's best to order several things at once if possible.  First up were the shumai: traditional (shrimp and pork), scallop (pork, bamboo, mushroom), and beef. The traditional and the scallop were good but similar in taste. The traditional had some gold leaf on top and the scallop was topped with tobiko. The beef wasn't too appetizing for me. The flavor combination of whatever was in the beef didn't work for me.   Next up were some tacos and the Chinese street sandwich. For the tacos we had fish barbacoa, carnitas and silencio. They were all just a little better than the tacos at a traditional taco stand. The duck tongue was a nice spicy treat that you don't usually see.  Definitely something you have to try once.",

    "text": "We were scoping out the spiffy new Cosmopolitan Hotel when we passed by this very interesting looking restaurant. There were two \"to-go counters\" on either side of the entrance--one said \"OPEN: Chinese Food,\" the other \"OPEN: Mexican Food.\" Intrigued, we decided to see if we could get in for dinner on the spot and got lucky scoring the table of a no-show reserved party. Vegas can be a gamble, but sometimes you do win!  As its name (and exterior!) would suggest, China (pronounced chee-na) Poblano is an experiment in mixing Asian and Latin cuisine. From dim sum to tacos to noodles with huitlacoche (corn smut, apparently), this is where Chinatown meets the Mission. Yes, I'm sort of from San Francisco.  I give this place 5 stars for the decor (and service, which was also very good). The outside that's set up to look like a city street with cheap Mexican and Chinese eateries side by side is a front for a very swanky restaurant on the inside. Bicycle wheels hanging from the ceiling, random Asian and Native American-looking knickknacks stacked upon the walls in artsy fartsy fashion, splashes of colorful paint... I was in interior design heaven. Great job on that.  On the other hand, for the food and its value, I can only give three stars. It was delicious, but ridiculously overpriced. $12.88 for four pieces of har gao? Teeny tiny pieces too, like a third the size of the shrimp dumplings you can get at any authentic Chinese restaurant. $15.88 for won ton noodle soup?? $15 for guacamole?!?! I get it that this is a trendy fusion restaurant and that the chef is famous, but come on now. Ethnic street food in a fancy hotel in Las Vegas is still ethnic street food, which means it should be cheap. Essentially, you are paying to dine in this very nicely and expensively decorated business venture.  All things considered, it was a satisfying meal and I'm glad I got to try this place. Our party of six ordered about half the menu and doubled up on some dishes as well. Clearly I was not buying dinner that evening... I'll save whatever money I bring back from Vegas for my neighborhood taqueria, thank you.",

There's the Mexican side, and there's the Chinese side, with not a lot of fusion mixes, it was either purely Chinese or Mexican. I would say the Chinese food was actually pretty good, the shumai's were pretty inventive and tasty, I like the fish eggs on them, gave a lil nice pop sensation and the pork mix was good. I also like the house made vinegar/soy sauce mix, it was delicious! The Mexican cuisine part however, was terrible. The taco's, burritos were all so bland to me. In fact, I didn't even want to finish it, I gave the rest of my tacos to my friend who was famished and was lamenting the whole time of \"why did we choose a damn tapas place right after a pool party, this place is wack!\" he just wanted to fill his belly up, understandably so. Agreed on that point, and on that same point, if I couldn't even bare to finish a beef taco after a pool party, that says a lot about that beef taco. So if you eat here, my recommendation is to stick to the Chinese dishes! The Mexican dishes were just awful.",

I do have to warn you that if you are hungry, this is probably not the right place for you unless you are prepared to spend a little extra casino winnings. If you are hungry , the torta is the way to go, but it doesn't quite have the same complexities of flavor as the other dishes. If I were to rate based on value, probably closer to 2.5 stars.",

    "text": "I have stopped getting horrified at prices of any establishment inside a Las Vegas strip hotel. Yes China Poblano is a bit overpriced in the general scheme of things, but for its kind, fairly normal.   Came here for some food before heading into Marquee, since it's right in front of the club. We weren't too hungry but, kids, lots and lots of liquor on an empty stomach = wishing you were dead the next morning. So, light meals. I got the traditional siu mai and my friend got the queso fundido.  Let me remind you that I was (mostly) sober at this point.  The siu mai was bomb. Maybe I hadn't had siu mai for a while and really missed it. Maybe very slight intoxication made it yummier. Who knows? But I thought it was great. So great in fact that the day before the trip ended, I just had to come back.  And yes, it was still good the second time around (and totally sober this time). Plus they had a dish called Like Water for Chocolate. Come on. Bookworm that I was, I could not resist. And yes it was good. Dragonfruit and rose petals and quail! Exotic and delicious.  I'd definitely go back.",

Very well-thought out menu. They also make their guacamole fresh right in front of you, which was a nice touch.   I ordered the \"Mongolian Beef Lettuce,\" which is marinated beef tips seasoned with shishito peppers, ginger, soy sauce and Chinkiang black vinegar, and wok-tossed with romaine hearts. For some reason, I was thinking I would be getting something that resembled lettuce wraps, but it ended up being a fancy-named salad. (That's where I took a star off.) But the meat itself was marinated well, and the dish as a whole had good flavor. But it didn't wow me.  The upside was the drink I ordered: their version of a Moscow Mule. I can't remember the name of this drink, but I think they called it the Tequila Mule... don't quote me on that. But it was divine! All of their cocktails sounded delicious as well. Although not 5 stars, I'd recommend this interesting Chinese-Mexican fusion eatery.",

    "text": "This is only based upon my item I chose which was the 20 Vegetable Fried Rice. As you can see from the picture it has a lot of that vegetables as promised, but not as much as I anticipated. Each one is either crunchy or soft depending upon its variety. I try to get as many pictures of vegetables that were in there as possible, you can see some yams baby carrots just various vegetables and there. I know it looks like meat in there, I know there's 1 little piece I thought was a piece of pork, and I almost flipped out but it wasn't...it was actually a sweet potato. The taste is very flavorful the vegetables were crunchy and really good. I did order a taco but by the time I finished the rice,  It had not come out and think that the league was not on my bill. He must not have heard me and I was already finished and wasn't willing to wait for a taco to come. If you want it a little spicy I'd ask for some chili sauce which they gladly supply and also some soy sauce, you could ask for as well.  The sauce makes the flavor more intense, as far as the chili sauce goes and the soy sauce just makes it a little saltier, which I don't really need any saltier - I thought it was perfectly seasoned. They put a nice bundle of cilantro on top, which I feel was really needed. Although, I wish they would cut it up a little bit better was hard eating because it would string out of my mouth and I was kind of trying to be more delicates because I was sitting in the bar area.  I enjoyed it emensely, it was a pick on the Food TV App, I know Food TV had them on there for this exact plate. I am going go tback there go back in to try another couple dishes but I'll make a reservation next time.    The reason for the 4 stars is because it was a very small portion.  For $20 I thought it was a small scoop of rice with a bunch of small vegetables in it. The portion I was not impressed with nor the amount of vegetables but the flavor was definitely there. Again, I did add the chili sauce and maybe I did a bit of the soy sauce but it wasn't much because it was already seasoned well.  Over all, if I was gonna go back I would order this again, it was pretty good. I think I really loved all the vegetables in there and I didn't feel it needed any meat; so I can't tell you that whether that would have been enhanced the flavors or not but that would be up to you to choose to put a meat in the dish, as it is an option. I thought it was good without the meat but that's me.  The young gentleman next to me got the cojitto fries and he said he really enjoyed them. I guess they had fries with some Mole sauce and some cojitto cheese on it as a appetizer,  it wasn't a big order.  The young lady next to me she ordered the Chipotle Taco and I don't think she was happy with it as she left more than half on her plate but that was mostly like somebody else said, it fell apart and went everywhere...on the floor and I believe her legs.",

    "text": "Hold the phone, $45 dollars per person for an 8 course tasting menu at a Jose Andres fusion concept restaurant that unites Mexican and Chinese?! Sign us up!!  Came here recently during a trip for my bestie's bday and was truly impressed by the experience. Our waitress, Angie, really went above and beyond for us. I had made sure to make reservations beforehand on the OpenTable app, and am so glad that Angie really took to heart the fact that I wanted to make this dinner as meaningful as possible.   We were seated immediately and ordered a bottle of still water to share. After having afternoon tea earlier that day, we decided to have hot tea with our dinner as well. Angie informed us that the tea menu here was very thoughtful and well-researched, a fact that is most the time overlooked. I decided on the Shanghai Rose, since I'm a sucker for rose tea, and pretty much rose anything. We each got our own cast iron tea pot. The tea itself was a blend of black tea and rose petals infused with lychee and I have to say, I was in love!! The tea was extremely rose-forward, which I adored and was smooth and medium bodied despite how light it was. So yummy!   Chips and salsa were good but nothing mind blowing. The tuna ceviche was fabulous, super fresh and great texture. Loved the amount of acidity and addition of quinoa. The Snow Pea Leaf salad with citrus segments, pomegranate seeds and walnuts was remarkable, perfect balance of flavors, perfectly tender greens and just enough dressing. Super light.    Because I had mentioned my bestie's bday, Angie threw in an order of the steamed barbecue pork buns, which came alongside the traditional Siu Mai, both displayed in a bamboo steamer. The pork buns were so fluffy and soft, with a generous amount of sweet and savory filling. The traditional Siu Mai featured a superb blend of shrimp and pork, as well as jicama, mushroom and peanut, all topped with just a touch of gold flake. So juicy, with lovely layers of developed umami flavor. Could have eaten this Siu Mai all night.  Carnitas tacos and shrimp mojo were both flavorful and we cooked. Twenty vegetable fried rice was addicting! With so many different veggies, I was worried that this fried rice might be too busy, but that was far from the case. The mango sticky rice for dessert did fall a bit short. It was fun and creative take on a traditional dish, but a sweetened cream foam with mango and crisped rice just left you wanting for something to chew and physical chunks of mango.   As our meal came to an end, Angie brings out a birthday dessert complete with lit candle! The dessert was a chocolate statuette filled with mousse, caramelized banana slices and this absolutely heavenly ginger ice cream! I could not stop eating the freaking ice cream with the banana! They need to make pints of that stuff so I can take a pint back to the room next time! My bestie had so much fun smashing open the chocolate statuette with the back of her spoon and mixing everything together for the perfect bite!  Angie wasn't done surprising us though, she was kind enough to bring us two sparking juices (she took note that we weren't drinking alcohol with dinner and acted accordingly!) so that we could toast to my bestie's bday! In her words, \"Because every birthday deserves a toast!\" THANK YOU Angie! You're exemplary customer service really made our experience one that we will remember for our lifetimes!  China Poblano isn't the fanciest place in Vegas, but it has enough flavor, personality and A1 service to compete with the big boys! Will definitely be back and am suggesting it to every person I know that is going to Vegas!",

    "text": "Came here for dinner on a Friday night with my girlfriend, and the restaurant wasn't as packed as I expected it to be, a bad sign for a Vegas restaurant on the strip. Regardless, I wanted to try it because Jose Andres is one of my favorite chefs and because we make it a goal to try a different restaurant every time we're in town. We ordered the tasting menu, as well as the cocktail experience.  The cocktails were supposed to be timed with the different food courses, but that did not happen. I drink many different cocktails, and these were by far the worst cocktails I've had. The only good one was the old fashioned, but that's pretty hard to mess up. The rest were extremely sour and was not balanced well at all.  The food was also on a similar note. The tuna ceviche was decent, albeit a very small portion. The chips and salsa weren't so great. The salsa wasn't spicy at all, and too sweet. This salsa is a mockery of Mexican cuisine. Next, the watermelon salad was good however, the dressing was very tart. The sesame oil, watercress, and watermelon made a nice balance of flavors along with the bitterness of the watermelon radish. The carnitas taco is another failure when it comes to Mexican cuisine. The tortilla couldn't hold in the ingredients so it kept ripping. What was supposed to be a crispy chicharron on top was stale, and the carnitas lacked flavor.  The shrimp mojo was salty and smelled of fermented black beans or something, it wasn't good. I was excited for the siu mai course at least, until the runner brought it. Inside the bamboo steamer, was too small pieces. They try to make it fancy by putting gold flakes on top, but the siu mai itself tasted like it was frozen and steamed. Wish they gave at least six pieces to share instead of just one piece per person. The last savory dish was the twenty vegetable fried rice. The fried rice had too much soy sauce and was a miss.  Their take on mango sticky rice was interesting and appealing, however there's no sticky rice to be found. It's just glazed mango pieces on the bottom, hidden by a mountain of cream and rice puffs (like toasted rice Krispies).  The one star goes to the server for her outstanding service. The bartender who made the drinks clearly doesn't know what they are doing because it was just plain awful. I hate to waste alcohol, but I couldn't finish two of them because the flavor was terrible. The food has no fusion aspects to it. It is either Chinese or Mexican, and they fail miserably at both. I also cook for a career so I'd like to think that I know what I am talking about when tasting the food. The chefs here clearly do not know what they are doing.  Spent about $170 for two people, and this is the first time in Las Vegas where I really felt that I wasted my money to eat here. I stay at the Cosmopolitan a lot and this is by far the worst restaurant in the hotel. Take your money elsewhere, such as Jaleo, Beauty & Essex, Estatorios Milos, Momofuku, or Zuma.  Worst dining experience in Vegas. Period.",

    "text": "China Poblano is the Intertwining Marriage of both Chinese & Mexican Cuisine, both cooking Influences coexisting on one Menu for Diners to try. Who could've thought of such a Thing, none other than the Master of Tapas in America (Jose Andres), located up on the 2nd floor of the Cosmopolitan around the Corner of a Wall with many Cows staring at you as you attempt to go in the Human sized entrance with the words \"China Poblano\" repeatedly placed on the Entrance glass in Red, White & Green Lettering (Note: all people who are over 6 Feet mind your head as you walk in).  As I stepped in to see Plants on the Steps/Shelf like area, a Mirror on the Ceiling looking down at the Patrons, Multiple Multicultural Symbols above the Bar Area, 2 different Blue Shelves with numerous Masks and Chinese Statues hanging from that Customers are ever so curious about who wore them. I sat over at the Open Kitchen Area waiting for my order to be taken and as I sat there I kept wondering whose Handprint was carved into the Countertop. The menu draws things from both cuisines like Dim Sum, Noodles and Fried Rice from China and Chips & Salsa, Guacamole, Tacos and Ceviche from Mexico.  My waiter came over to take my Order, the one dish that drew me here and how I even knew about this place was the 20 Vegetable Fried Rice featured on the Best Thing I Ever Ate episode: Las Vegas recommended by Pastry Chef - Johnny Iuzzini. While waiting for it I deciding to order a drink, one called The Jade Garden which had a Cilantro infused Tequila with Makrut Lime and a Szechaun Peppercorn Syrup. The drink came with a highly yellowish green color topped with a bit of Red to accent it, Tequila with some herbaceous notes, the Lime brings some sour notes and the Peppercorn Syrup brought a Mild Flair instead of being overbearing.  Next was a Duck Tongue Taco, as disgusting or Obscene as it may sound to you, it was Delicious by all means. With some Lychee to give it another layer of Sweetness to pair well with that Sumptuous, Fatty and Gelatinous Tongue. My only critique would've been some Nuts for Textural contrast (due to it being so soft) and some Heat like Serrano or Jalapeno Pepper to counter that Richness, but otherwise it was good. Then the 20 Vegetable Fried Rice was placed in front of me with a Thud, like the Title say (20 different Seasonal Vegetables) I even had the waiter have the Chef write them down so I could even Remember.  Let me list them off for you: 1. Squash, 2. Zucchini, 3. Chinese Eggplant, 4. Carrot, 5. Chayote, 6. Jicama, 7. Daikon, 8. Watermelon Radish, 9. Cauliflower, (3 Different Mushrooms) 10. Beech, 11. Oyster & 12. Shiitake, 13. Ginger, 14. Garlic, 15. Tofu, 16. Yellow Chive, 17. Pea Shoots, 18. Sweet Potato, 19. Snap Peas and 20. Baby Radish. Talk about a Mouthful and they asked if I wanted Chicken, Beef, Pork or Shrimp I said no I want those Vegetables to take Center Stage and speak for themselves. All of it was mixed with Jasmine Rice, Eggs, White Onions and seasoned with both Fish & Oyster Sauce. It was like a Fried Rice Veggie Garden, so many different Textures and flavors going on in this Array of Earthly Delectables.   All of that for just 20 Bucks (a dollar a vegetable), All in all great stop for a Late Lunch as it was past 2:30 in the afternoon when I got here. From the way it was I could tell there was a lot of Feng Shui (Positive Energy) looming around the Room with everyone sitting down and enjoying the Food. This is the result of 2 different Cuisines teaming up to achieve a Common Goal, Happiness on the Plate !!!",

    "text": "Food was subpar at best. I had their wonton soup and it was so bland I had to get chili oil. The dan dan noodles stuck together and the flavor was off ( yes I'm Chinese and yes this was a staple food in my household). The fried rice was okay.   My cup was dirty it had a crusty on the inside of the glass. My food arrived late and my server was inattentive.  Our server never cleared my plates so it just stacked up in front of me. I ended up piling it up for them.  At the end I was waiting for my bill and a waitress came and wiped off my table getting food on my ( the rice) dress. Then the waitress put two new people next me and pushed my friend's phone over.  I felt like they were pushing me out even before I got my card back. I asked for the manager and she pretty much said that it was an honest mistake since my friend had left the table to go to the bathroom and it seemed like no one was there.  Worst place ever. Don't bother coming   I also saw a waiter with long hair touch his greasy hair then touch the food and plate then serve it.",

Located in the Cosmopolitan hotel & casino on the strip, China Poblano embraces both new inspired creations and old authentic dishes! Was happily overwhelmed by the extensive menu, from noodles and tacos, to fresh guacamole or dumplings! We weren't sure what to order -- and luckily chef Jose Andres offers experience menus which allows you try bits of the menu, chef's choice!   We opted to try the TASTING MENU -- which was $45 per person. It included:  1. CHIPS & SALSA 2. TUNA CEVICHE SPOON (ahi tuna tossed with a soy dressing, avocado, cilantro, toasted pecans, red onion and fresno chiles, topped with crispy amaranth) 3. TRADITIONAL SIU MAI (mini dumpling with shrimp, pork, jicama, mushrooms, peanuts) 4. SNOW PEA LEAF SALAD (seasonal pea shoots tossed in a sesame dressing, surrounded by snow peas and topped with fresh orange, pomegranate seeds and walnuts) 5. CARNITAS TACO (braised pork, chicharron, spicy salsa verde cruda) 6. SHRIMP MOJO (gulf shrimp sauteed with dried chiles, shallots, sweet black garlic and finished with rajas) 7. TWENTY VEGETABLE FRIED RICE (fried rice, egg, pea shoots and twenty seasonal vegetables) 8. MANGO STICKY RICE (dessert)  We also ordered:  - GUACAMOLE $16 (made tableside, served with warm corn tortillas; we ordered one spicy, one non-spicy -- I still felt like the non-spicy one had a kick!) - YOUNG COCONUT CEVICHE $14 (young coconut, avocado, teardrop peppers, red onion and cilantro are dressed with coconut water and fresh citrus juices) - GOLDEN PIGS $14.88 (four pieces of fried delicate steamed buns with chinese barbecue pork with a side of condensed milk sauce) *MY FAVE!  The 7 of us were blown away by the unique flavors and food presentation -- as well as great service. A huge thank you to Chef JJ as well as our sweet server Sammy for an enjoyable dining experience!  SIDE NOTE: If you are torn on what drink to order, there is also a \"cocktail experience\" where you can try four small unique cocktails inspired by the spirits of China and Mexico!",

    "text": "I had never heard of Chinese Mexican fusion before trying China Poblano and I have to say that I was fairly skeptical about what the food would be like here. I'll say that I was very pleasantly surprised by the overall experience. Our party of 2 shared the queso fundido with chorizo, the dan dan noodles (spicy), wonton noodle soup, and the Lucky 6 shu mai. Queso fundido is one of my absolute favorite dishes and the recipe here did not disappoint, although I wish they had paired it with blue corn tortillas instead of regular corn tortillas. Dan dan noodles were tasty but the spicy sauce they use numbs your mouth a little after a while which makes it hard to taste the flavor of the food itself. Wonton noodle soup was average, but I really enjoyed the shu mai. The Lucky 6 has three different types of shu mai - chicken, scallop, and traditional (pork I think?) While smaller than the actual dish you would get in a Chinese restaurant, the quality was very high and it paired well with the dipping sauce they had on the side.   Of course, what is a good meal without good drinks to go with it? Their version of the traditional margarita is very interesting - the drink itself is small but has a thick foam on top that has the nice lime and salt flavor that pairs well with the cocktail itself. I decided to go with one of their speciality cocktails of the night, which was a mezcal base with grapefruit notes - so delish.   Overall, I enjoyed my experience at China Poblano very much and look forward to my next visit!",

Hostess and server was great and extremely attentive.   The menu was fairly small and pricey. But I figured the pricing will be made up by the taste and portion. I was wrong. The portions are extremely small. The server was not wrong about this being like \"tapas\" style. For street sandwich, it was the size of a slider and cost $8. It was super salty. I also tried out the fried wontons. The dish looked big but it was just fried wonton paper. The meat and stuffing portion was maybe about .... three quarters of a ping pong ball(?) The hoisin base sauce to dip it in was salty, too. Anyway, for the pricing, I got a small salt dish. I was not too happy. I recommend going elsewhere like the small little spots right next door.",

    "text": "China Poblano was a must-stop on my quarterly visits to Vegas for a while. Their pozole and spicy, smoky salsa is what hooked me. A few slip ups made me slow down my visits, but this is still a solid option with some of the best reasonably priced food on the strip.   This is Vegas- chips and salsa aren't free, but they're worth the buy. Chips are warm and salty and you're given a big bowl of amazing salsa. The best dim sum options remain: When Pigs Fly and Golden Pigs. The tacos are mediocre and wildly overpriced. I recommend ordering some small plates to share (or eat alone) so you can try a bit of everything!  Staff has been pretty hard to grab, regardless of how busy the dining area is. Waiters and waitresses are always nice helpful, but don't expect your waiter to be around for questions or additional drinks.  I'll be back when the weather gets cooler (for Vegas) for pozole!",

The portions aren't the biggest but we were able to share between 3 girls just perfectly. I guess it helps when you eat with 2 skinny bitches who don't eat much. We started out with the posole which ended up being more on the hot and sour soup consistency. But the flavor was really good and adding chicharron to it just gave it that perfect crunch and texture to the soup. I'd order again and eat it by myself. We also got the chicken shu mai which were the steamed dumplings. Sadly we couldn't getting anything seafood because my sister is allergic. So hard to eat Asian cuisine without seafood. Still, it was yummy even though it was chicken. Juicy and flavorful. We then got 2 different kinds of noodles. One was a tomato and egg and the other was Dan-Dan style. Both were absolutely delicious. Noodles were homemade and had the best al dente texture to chew. Our favorite was surprisingly the tomato and egg. Again.. I'd eat that by myself next time. I guess with all the dishes I'd eat it by myself... But that's just because I'm much bigger than the other 2 girls and carry waaaaay more muscle mass than them! Lol I want to come back and try more noodles. I'm addicted! And the service was great.... Also great that most of the male servers there are pretty handsome. Just sayin.",

It's hard to know where to start, but DRINKS, our bartender Danny was amazing his drinks were all well balanced and executed flawlessly.   The food was a whole different story, the fusion between Mexican and Chinese/ Asian spices works!!   My favorite dish was the rib eye with black mole and Chinese spices. The flavors were so delicate and balanced nothing over powered its self but complemented each other. The maize for the tortillas gets flown in from Mexico they are so aromatic and sweet i wanted to take a few dozens home lol.   Thank you Jesus and chef Carlos for such an amazing experience!!",

We had to wait about 30-45 minutes before we could get a table so I suggest making a reservation before hand. Once we got seated I was immediately drawn to the decor. I loved the mix of mexican and asian decor. The atmosphere and vibe of the place was great.  Our service was great, very attentive and filled our drinks before they were ever empty.  Food wise, YOU MUST GET DIM SUM. I've never really had dim sum before this so I was very impressed with them. They are so flavorful and filling and even topped with gold flakes! I also ordered the Viva China taco. I wanted to order something out of my comfort zone and that was definitely it. I personally disliked it and wouldn't recommend ordering it unless you like very, very crispy meat and oysters. That was probably my fault for ordering something I knew I probably wouldn't enjoy, lol.  My co-worker ordered the 20 vegetable fried rice, which was pretty good. I think $20 is overpriced for it after seeing the portion size. But it was perfectly cooked and delicious.  Overall, I enjoyed the experience!",

The menu had food from both places but nothing that mixed them.  The waiter said we had to have the best taco in the world...carnitas.  Being from San Diego it was just ok.  The salsa for it was worth the $5.  For the main course we got the Mongolian beef lettuce and Kao Lao Loa noodles.  We were told it was family style so it would be plenty of food.  If you consider 5 small pieces of beef and a plate full of lettuce enough then you are in the right place.  The one piece off beef I had was good.  Too bad they are too cheap to actually make it family style.  The worst part was the noodles.  When I order noodles I expect a plate full of noodles.  This was individual coils of noodles stood up on their end in a bamboo steam pot.  There was 20 noodles with a tiger dipping sauce.  I almost spit up up the sauce on the first bite.  Was like dirty water.  Way too much hype very little to actually eat.  I will never go back.",

We were quickly approached by the bartender, she was very knowledgable about the tequila and various other spirits. Her recommendations on he tequila she served us were right in the money. As for the food, we tried several different tacos pork, short rib, lobster, fish. They were small but very tasty. We also enjoyed the fish and chips as well as her recommendations of some shumai with quail egg on it. They were really really good. I love andres, and before you go in there, as a diner should always have an idea if what you're gonna pay; to me it was just about right.  The fusion of Asian and Spanish inspired dishes is interesting and something you don't see everywhere. Of course I wish portions were bigger, but there is a lot of detail placed in these small plates. I would recommend everyone go to a Jose andres restaurant at some point in their lives.",

A few thoughts: -love the decor inside.  funky and fun - highlighted by the chinese fertility dolls in the middle/center, which are also where people sit while waiting for a table.  -cocktails were great.  had the salt drink, as described by others, and it was phenomenal.  -excellent service.  Ali, our waiter, was attentive and just a very nice dude.  And, food was a really unique mix of flavors.  Loved the tuna ceviche dish.  Also the eggplant was really different (in a good way), loved the consistency of it.  If I was to give this place a few suggestions it would be: a little less red meat/pork on the menu; tacos, as described by others, were a little greasy; and while the eggplant itself was cooked very well, the sauce on it was a little too heavy.  Lastly, GET THE CHIPS AND SALSA.  Some of the best I've ever had.",

I had high expectations because I the associated chef's name, but clearly this is a perfect example of throwing a famous chef's name on a restaraunt to boost sales but not actually generate food representative of the chef's talent. The flavor of all the items we tried was lacking. Never mind the missing expected complexity in flavor, they didn't even have a basic salty spicy flavor. What gives? For these prices I expect something better than average, and that's why the rating drops to 2 stars.",

The concept is fine, and the food wasn't bad, it just wasn't anything special. The braised pork street sandwich tasted EXACTLY like their steamed buns with bbq pork. In fact, half the menu tasted the same. If you're in Vegas for a weekend, I'd skip this place. The decor is nice, and I enjoyed their \"Tea for two\" cocktail served in a teapot, but the food was a let down in comparison to other restaurants in the same niche.",

We all agreed that the experience could have been a lot better had we had a waiter who was helpful, happy to explain the menu, and had a personality.

    "text": "I tried China Poblano for the first time on a Thursday night. The menu sounded good but something stuck out right away. It says in bold type at the top, \"What brings Mexico and China together?\", and goes on to briefly answer this question. Now, to me, it would seem there was an effort to blend the two cuisines. However, looking over the menu I could see this was not the case, save a couple of dishes. This isn't necessarily a bad thing but the menu intro suggests fusion when in reality it's more like co-habitation.  We sat at the bar where you can see the tortillas being made fresh constantly. The ambiance was noisy but not over-bearing and the lack of a DJ certainly helped things unlike some other Cosmopolitan eatery that rhymes with Coal Screens. The service was prompt and I felt the server was very good at explaining menu items that may have been spicy, contained raw foods, or were otherwise out of the ordinary.  I ordered a Carnitas taco and a Viva China taco. The tortillas are about 6 inches in diameter and not overstuffed so be prepared for this before you go. This is not Tacqueria (insert name here) that serves heaping piles of food with beans and rice on the side. The tacos are served by themselves and any sides are extra. That being said, the tacos I ordered were very good. The Viva China taste is a bit dominated by the raw oyster. The Carnitas taco was top notch. Both tacos seemed a little on the greasy side but most of it was the sauce/salsa leaking out the bottom.  And now to the price. Yes, this place is expensive compared to an actual street vendor but it's in a casino. The menu is posted outside the restaurant and freely available online. Do a little research ahead of time and you can decide for yourself if the price is fair.  China Poblano is great if you just need a quick bite to eat before a show or before heading out for the night. The take out window is a nice amenity if you're just passing through and need a bit of sustenance. I would not recommend China Poblano for a big meal simply because the a la carte nature of the menu can add up quickly. You can easily spend $50 and still leave hungry.",

Maybe it's because I took a lot of the waiter's recommendations, but every dish I ordered was at hit.  (And lest you think, he was trying to pad the bill, I told him I was torn between two dishes and he steered me towards the less-expensive one.)  I would highly recommend the Kao Lao Lao, which are described as steamed noodles, but were more like rolled tortilla strips served with a flavorful dipping sauce, and the carnitas taco, with tender meat and a wonderful contrast of textures with its crispy toppings.  I also had the lamb pot stickers, which were beautifully presented (although perhaps a little greasy) and the dancing eggplant, which was roasted until creamy.  The service was great and the decor is very cute.  Everything was all really flavorful and beautiful on the plate.  I look forward to returning.",

This restaurant is located on the second floor of my very favorite Vegas hotel, the Cosmopolitan. The seating is comfy and somewhat communal with long benches and tables. The decor is chic and earthy. The drinks are spectacular...any of the cocktails are great. We loved the small dishes, especially the Tuna Ceviche and the Coctel de Damarones. Both of these dishes are unbelievable and the tuna and lump crab were plentiful! I was partial to the Mexican side of the menu but enjoyed everything we had. The noodles are a great selection for the Asian flavor. The Shrimp Mojo was simple but packed with flavor. The food is sultry and inviting, just like the atmosphere. You usually don't have to worry about reserving a table way in advance. I can't recommend China Poblano enough. You have to experience it for yourself. Enjoy!",

    "text": "I came here for dinner on a weeknight because I was intrigued by the venue and concept.  The first thing I noticed was that the prices seemed quite high for Chinese/Mexican food, but this was the Cosmopolitan, so not surprising.  We had a combination of Chinese and Mexican Food which was good, but really nothing special.  What really surprised me was the disjointed service.  All of our food was brought out piecemeal.  My girlfriend ordered two tacos and my buddy and I eached orded a soup dish.  My girlfriend got one of her tacos brought to her first.  Then she sat there and waited for my buddy and I to get our food, one at a time, several minutes apart.  Then my girlfriend's second taco came.  Bringing out the food piecemeal would make sense if it was a family-style meal, but I think it was pretty clear we each ordered our own dish.  The kicker was that we ordered chips and salsa, and didn't get it until we were almost done with our dinner, and then only after I asked about it.  The waitress was very friendly and pleasant, but this restaurant was just kind of off this night.  I think a restaurant that charges these kinds of prices for this kind of food needs to compensate by offering something unique, whether it be service, a special venue, etc.  I just didn't see it here, and there are way too many other great dining options in Vegas.  I'm glad I tried it, but will probably not go back.",

Inauthentic and disingenuine, yes, but it wasn't the food that even captured my attention.  It's the strange fusion decor really detracts from the mediocre fusion food.  How do you have flashing pictures of Chairman Mao next to the Dalai Lama, who is in fact Tibetan and heavily oppressed by the Chinese government?   Actually read up on the history of China Poblana: \"This is story of a young girl who was snatched from her home in India by Portuguese pirates and sold into slavery in the Philippines - and of the odyssey that took her half-way around the world, where her dress wound up starting a fashion craze...She's known as La China Poblana, roughly meaning \"The Chinese Woman of Puebla (Mexico).\" She wasn't Chinese, but in old-time Mexico, anyone or anything from Asia was tagged Chinese.\"  If you read the top portion of the menu explaining the significance of the restaurant's namesake, claiming that it was an homage to a Chinese girl kidnapped by pirates (possibly raped and assaulted) and forced to spend her life in Mexico and she was known as \"China Poblano.\"  Sorry to say, but can't support a restaurant that capitalizes off historical inaccuracies, pictures of a dictator next to an oppressed religious monk, but then again it's Vegas where truth, content, and respect doesn't really matter.    Whoever came up with the concept of the restaurant is either culturally retarded or a pecuniary jackass capitalizing off the culturally retarded.",

They have a separate vegetarian menu & can accommodate vegans and those who don't want eggs. The menus are clearly marked & the staff are well educated on this. They have fresh fruit based drinks (aqua frescas) that change daily - be sure to try them. They guacamole is made fresh right in front of you & was very good. The chips are cooked in the morning in vegetable oil before any meat items are cooked. The spring rolls are very good - not very oily & with a good variety of vegetables. The tacos are unique, soft  wrapped, light & full of flavor. I enjoyed the hongos taco (on the menu last time I came), the taco nopales, & the refried bean taco - all were great & light - they come in orders of one. The chayote salad is a very unique item & was good - it is not your typical green leaf salad, so try it. Finally, the terra cotta chocolate & paloma deserts were very good. Bottom line - great vegetarian food with taste & creativity. The service was very very good. The atmosphere is nice. For a party of 2, I would get 2 tacos, the spring rolls, & the guacamole, adding on another taco or two if hungry, along with the aqua fresca. For one person, guac, a couple tacos, the chayote salad & desert is plenty.",

One side is Asian with Asian workers and the other side is Mexican with Mexican Workers.   The food is mostly served tapas style.  I started out with a fish taco. It cost over $6.00 and was slightly bigger than a street taco. The taco seemed very freshly made but.......the fish taco was too acidic for my taste and sort of flat tasting. This taco was made with a very fresh tasting but very thin corn tortilla that got soggy and fell apart.  It wasn't bad just not yummy.   I sort of fell for the hype about the 20 vegetable fried rice. This dish was featured on Food Network TV's Show, \"The Best Thing I Ever Ate.\" The fried rice looked beautiful and had butterfly shaped carrot slices and a couple fancy baby vegetables but if you closed your eyes when you ate it the fried rice tasted the same as from any cheap Chinese take out place.  Service was friendly and attentive. The atmosphere is cool and interesting.",

Soy sauce was drenched in my $20 fried rice, I had better fried rice at a chinese express fast food joint.  The shumai didn't even need to be dipped in soy sauce.  The chao su bao (steamed pork bbq bun) was so salty and intense, I didn't even eat the inside and only ate the edible steam white bun.  Saving the worst for last was the hot and sour soup... tasted like a tub of thick, salty, starchy glob of sauce, where it practically solidified into gelatin before my eyes.    Costed almost $60 but unfortunately wouldn't even touch this if it were free!",

    "text": "Really wanted to give this restaurant 4.5 or 5 stars for the food and atmosphere, but the service from our waitress knocks it down to a 2.  Was really excited to try this place. Came here on Friday night with my husband. We placed our food order and drinks and were almost immediately spoken to in a condescending and rude way when my husband tried asking our waitress what type of vodka they had and requested that she let him know if the one he wanted was not available. He said he would then let her know which one he would like instead- yes, we are a little picky about the brand but don't think this is an unreasonable request and we certainly were not rude to her. So, we get our drinks, which were good and proceeded to wait for our food. We got guacamole and pot stickers which were tasty- again, the food is great!  Then waited for our rice and tacos. And waited. And waited some more. When we dared to ask when the other food would be coming out, our waitress sharply responded with \"your food will be out when it is ready\". Not, \"I'm so sorry for the wait, let me check on that and get back to you\". Or, \"I think it should be out soon, but let me check, the kitchen must be really busy\". Or any other appropriate response with a LOT less attitude.  Our food finally did come out after waiting a bit longer and it was tasty but honestly all the attitude and bad service really just left us with a bad experience.   Both my husband and I have worked customer service jobs, and still do in varying degrees so bad customer service is just not acceptable in our opinion. Customer service in any restaurant/industry is a deal breaker but in a town like Vegas that is centered around tourism, it's pretty ridiculous to be treated the way we were. If we end up coming back to Vegas in the future, as much as I liked the food, we will not be going back. There are plenty of great food options in Vegas without the rudeness and attitude.",

Really artsy. :) my friend was more than pleased with all his food and I was happy with my mushroom tacos & that habanero salsa is to die for lol so if you go there get it !

My buddy highly recommended the tacos here, \"you got to try them, they will put a smile to your face.\"  I was skeptical because what would a Spaniard know about tacos?  A tortilla is considered an omelette in Spain.  But, I ran with my buddy's suggestion.   I did find myelf to be in an identity crisis when I walked in because the restuaurant is literally divided between Chinese ladies making noodles on my left and Mexican ladies making warm tortillas on my right.  I decided to sit on the right side to see the ladies make fresh hand made toritillas.    I had a few tacos: lengua (beef tongue), fish, hongos (mushrooms), pork belly, and barbacoa (braised short rib).  All the tacos had high quality ingredients, from the condiments to the meats.  My notable favorites were the beef tongue and hongos.  Beef tongue was very tender and seasoned well. Hongos had perfectly sauteed mushrooms on top of fresh guacamole. Very tasty.    Service was slow but staff were apologetic.  I would definitely be back for the tacos again.  I appreciate that Jose Andres maintained a traditional taco and did not kill it with unnecessary fusion techniques. I definitely did walk out with a smile on my face.",

All foods are freshly hand made with one kitchen for Chinese food and street dumplings while across is the other side is fresh made tortilla from the Mexican kitchen. You can get a fusion of both worlds. You can order single tacos served tapa style so you get to sample around the menu without being too full. My favorite noodles are no longer on the menu, but they have good vegetarians option as well. If you're vegetarian definitely try the hongos taco and Twenty veggie fried rice! All are great choices! Now if your just in the mood for small snacks must try the dim sum! If you're craving tacos and guacamole and civiche pick from the Mexican kitchen! This is definitely my go to place at the Cosmopolitan and all my friends have loved it. Try the lotus chips while you're ordering and discovering about the menu! The decor and art work is amazing a flare of both worlds.",

I would not recommend this place :(",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I stumbled in here after getting lost in the maze of the Cosmopolitan hotel and finding out that it was 10pm and not many places were open (surprising since this is Vegas).  It looked promising.  We were expecting a little fancy schmancy for the meal, price-wise and portion-wise, but we were in for a shock.  Extremely pricey for extrememely small protion sizes.  I understand the whole tapas concept, but these tapas were barely enough for one person to share with himself, let alone TWO whole people.  We ordered the scallop ceviche, which unbeknownst to us, was deconstructed.  I believe it was a $16 plate consisting of 4 parboiled baby scallops, like a large bay scallop (think: size of a little bouncy ball you get in a quarter machine), each sitting on a half key lime, sprinkled with what looked like paprika on top.  It tasted like a parboiled scallop sitting on top of a dry lime, sprinkled with something flavorless on top.  I cringed as I ate each scallop, thinking this was SOOO not worth $4, even for Vegas, ESPECIALLY for Vegas.  Next came carnitas tacos.  2 tiny street size tacos, which i will admit were very tasty, but again, very tiny, not filling at all.  At this point we were dying.  Then came the pork siu mai to save the day.  I believe these were one of the cheaper menu items, but it had twice as much food as our first 3 plates combined.  They were really tasty too, I could tell they were hand made.  These little dumplings were our saviors, at least we could leave feeling like we ate something and not pass out from starvation on our way out the door.  I expected a little more food, flavor, and decor to make up for the bill we were presented with.   That said, I won't be coming back,  and I wish I never came.",

    "text": "While wandering around looking for a place to eat, my friends and I stumbled upon China Poblano.  Once someone pointed out to me that it is a Jose Andres restaurant, I knew I had to try it.  Although I didn't think it was his best, I enjoyed every dish I had for one reason or another.  Like most of his restaurants, China Poblano is more of a tapas-style place in that they serve up smaller plates intended to be shared amongst a group.  Eating in this manner, I was able to try three different dishes. The first were the lamb pot stickers which were small in size, but surprisingly filling.  I enjoyed the \"crispy lace\" (in essence, extra fried bits from the pan, which is never a bad thing) and thought they were well made, but overall didn't find them different enough from anything I've had before.  On the other hand, the two types of tacos I tried were both tasty and very original.  The Viva China taco has soft beef tendon, Kumamoto oyster, and a touch of a slightly spicy sauce on top.  The oyster was the real standout here, as the softness of it complemented the texture of the tendon, while the natural saltiness of it really added a punch to the dish.  The other taco I tried was the Pancita al Pastor, which is slow-cooked pork belly and pineapple.  If you know me, you know I love pork belly, so this was a big winner.  The saltiness of the tender pork belly balanced so well with the sweetness of the pineapple and made for a great dish.  We also ordered some drinks.  I shared the cold \"tea\" for two, which was a mixture of green tea, tequila, and beer.  The presentation was nice, as it comes out in a tea pot and is served in a couple nice glasses, but flavor was a bit off.  Although I found it a refreshing drink, I thought they added a bit too much lemon to it and wished there was more of a green tea flavor.  Another friend ordered the lemon drop \"soup,\" a lemon vodka drink with lemon \"noodles\" made out of a gelatin-like substance.  It also seemed very refreshing, and the \"noodles\" were an interesting touch.  Overall, I really enjoyed my lunch at China Poblano.  Although it was a little expensive for a normal lunch, spending $25 to share 3 dishes and a drink at a Jose Andres restaurant seemed pretty reasonable.  Although it wasn't quite good enough to break into 4 star territory (felt like more of a 3.5 to me) I would definitely recommend checking it out if you are a fan of his, or if you are just looking for something different to try.",

For the Mexican taste we had some poblano flautas, it had duck, this was a special on their menu. It was rich with flavor! Then we added papas fritas. Of course I ordered Mexican Coke. We ended the meal with tres leches! Oh my this was decadent, and huge! Haha didn't expect it to be so wholesome. The manager, Jessica was incredible and so was our server!

Soups were all salty, but lacking an flavor at the same time.

    "text": "So when I heard Chinese Mexican fusion I expected something different than what it was. However, I wasn't disappointed when I saw the menu. It's broken up into Mexican style dishes and Chinese style dishes. Our server said it was similar to a \"tapas\" place with small plates that were meant to be shared, or to order two plates per person for a full meal. I ordered the Mexican asparagus and the Chinese Dancing Eggplant. The asparagus was amazing and I devoured all of it. Honestly would have been okay with just that because it was a pretty decent portion. The eggplant wasn't really what I expected. It's covered in a soy sauce glaze and these fish flakes (I forget the actual name, but they smell and taste really fishy). The eggplant was not the texture I expected. Was hoping for something I would have to chew rather than something that just slid down my throat. The taste was okay but I couldn't do the slimy-ish texture. We had them bring chips and salsa for the table and both were really good. I ordered the classic margarita and was not disappointed. If I ever make it back I really want to try the margarita flight, as a friend did and said it was amazing. Our server was great, answered all of our questions and made some great recommendations around the table that were raved about. He had no trouble dealing with the 14 rambunctious girls there for a bachelorette party and all of our food came out fairly quickly!  My gripe with this place is that even though it seems like there are a lot of choices, I had a tough time finding something to order other than my asparagus (which I was really excited about). I wish I would have ordered the tacos because they looked really good. A friend had the dan dan and said it was pretty spicy, but lost ordered off the Mexican portion of the menu.",

We ordered guacamole, and chips and salsa to start off. The salsa was really good and gave us time to check out the menu.   We had ordered drinks which took around 15-20 minutes to arrive. They were simple drinks; beer, vodka soda, gin soda, etcetera.   The server said he'd explain the menu eventually but never really got around to it.   I ordered chilaquiles and added chicken to them (which is very common in the original dish), the chicken came separate and seemed to have been dipped in oil. I still threw it on the hot pan that contained the chilaquiles and mixed them together (which should've been done in the kitchen, I think), and proceeded to eat. They were okay, nothing remarkable.   At the end, we got the check all together for the group. I guess the rush did let the server have separate tabs(?).  Surprisingly, they had already added the \"gratuity\" in the check and the server forgot to mention it.   Once again, this was during New Years Eve. May be a single occasion but I still would have expected more at a restaurant inside a casino.",

Since I imagine a lot of vacationers are frequenting this spot, I'll break down what we had:  Salt and Air Margarita: probably the best margarita I've ever had  Taro chips: unbelievable. We ordered these for our ceviche, but I was gobbling them up on their own. Insanely crisp and delicious.  Tuna Ceviche: delicious. And quite a large portion for the price. The only complaint I might have is that by the bottom of the bowl, the tuna was completely overpowered by the dregs of citrus juice, but to be fair we ate this quite slowly interspersed with other dishes. Might've had more time than normal for the tuna to get over marinated.  Siu Mai w/ Quail Eggs: the best dish of the night, and easily the best siu mai I've ever had. And trust me, I live in Queens in NYC, I know my Asian food. The meat was soft, insanely flavorful, and the eggs just bursts with a creamy eggy-ness in your mouth.  Pork Buns (When Pigs Fly): disappointing. I wouldn't be able to tell the difference between these and any old pork bun I come across. Not necessarily bad, but not great.  Duck Tongue Taco (Silencio): I am a fan of trying absolutely anything and everything, but this was just downright weird. I commend them for getting the tongue that soft, but the flavor wasn't appealing.   Beef Tendon Taco (Viva China): Outstanding. The beef tendon is crispy and packs an amazing amount of flavor. The sauce is delicious.   Carnitas Taco: My absolute favorite. I've never had such good meat in a carnitas taco.   Twenty Vegetable Fried Rice: this one was interesting. First of all, I should mention that my boyfriend can't stand onions, so I sadly had to get this sans any kind of onions or scallions. I bet that would really add to the flavor. However, even without onions, this dish got a hold of me. At first I thought \"meh, it's fried rice,\" but with each subsequent bite, I began to realize, \"wait, this is the BEST FRIED RICE I'VE EVER HAD.\" Every bite had a new vegetable. And the boy literally licked the bowl clean.   Chocolate Teracotta Warrior: really, we got this because we wanted our special dinner to end with SOME kind of dessert. The presentation is stunning, and the ginger ice cream mixed with the chocolate crumbles is delicious, but I could've done without this one. I have a feeling their other desserts are probably better.  The service throughout the meal was great, our waiter was very attentive and helpful in giving us tips on what we might want to order. And the vibe of the place was very nice. Casual, but upscale. And not crowded. I would definitely come here again.",

    "text": "We were pleasantly surprised by China Poblano, so I'm glad we didn't read the reviews before coming here.  First off, I'm not sure this is actually supposed to be a fusion restaurant.  From the outside, it looks like an Asian restaurant and a Mexican restaurant that just happen to be next to each other/share the same space.  And pretty much, that's how the food is as well.  We came here in the early evening the day of our arrival in Vegas and sat at the bar.  This probably enhanced the experience as our bartender/waiter/greeter was extremely friendly, personable, knowledgeable, and whatever other superlative -ables you want to add on there.  There's also some obvious advantages in having the waiter and the liquor right in front of you the entire time.  I ordered one of the special cocktails of the day, which was some sort of blackberry mojito.  It was good, but far outshined by my mom's salt air margarita which we are still talking about 8 months later.  Who knew foam could be so delicious?  The food was generally a success, with the tortilla chips being warm and fresh, the salsa having just the right amount of kick, and the tacos being messily delicious (try the beef tongue, trust me on this!).  On the Chinese side of things, mom adored her hot and sour soup while I would pass on the BBQ pork buns next time.  They were fine, but nothing special and for the prices you pay, special is a requirement.  With the number of options available in the Cosmo itself, not to mention all along the Strip, I'm not sure I would make a point of hurrying back here, but if someone suggested it or I found myself in the area with a craving for Mexican and/or Chinese, I would be perfectly pleased to pay them another visit.",

I like them mutually exclusively & never got on the fusion food bandwagon. I went in a party of 6, and we shared everything family style - that's the way to go!   Sitting on the \"patio\" is a great place for people watching, as it's across the way from Marquee and the other restaurants in the Cosmopolitan.   Some highlights from our meal: - Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice: absolutely delicious and strongly scented of sesame. - Chilaquiles: the Menorita cheese was so melty, salty and perfect - Shrimp Mojo: Light spice. I like the addition of the black garlic - Kao Lao Lao: Little rolled noodle sheets served with a fermented vegetable sauce. Very rich, umami flavor - I didn't personally get the duck tongue tacos, but those that did were blown away!  My only gripe was the price of alcohol. On a whim, we decided to order a pitcher of margarita & a few a la carte drinks - which pushed our $200 meal to well over $300. Oopsies, should have looked at the price beforehand. They were mediocre, so pre-party elsewhere.  Yes, there will be haters that say the prices are too high, but this is Vegas. It's food by Jose Andres, for heavens sake...",

    "text": "So I love me some Mr. Andres and was super excited to check out the new digs in Vegas, but I have to say I found CP almost *too* casual -- if that's possible.   Don't get me wrong.. you definitely see (and taste!) the Jose Andres flair in the menu but CP just doesn't feel special enough to match the food.  It's a simple space w/almost a fast food feel to it... I half expected to go up to the counter to order.  Gladly, we did have waiter service and our waiter was pretty great -- answering all our questions and coming by to check on us quite often.   The food prices also don't warrant the casualness.. I spent $70 on my half of the 'casual' meal which was well worth it in terms of the food, BUT for that price I'd like to enjoy my dinner in a space that makes me feel like it warrants that amount, know what I mean?   As for the food, the duck tongue taco and the pork belly sandwich were the standouts. I thought everything was very good but the noodle dish was rather 'meh' and I also didn't quite see what the hoopla was about with the fish taco -- fell kinda flat for me w/not much flavor.    I'd also skip the desserts...very lackluster.   All in all not sure I'd return.. save your $ for The Bazaar in LA where the True JA style shines through IMHO. ;-)",

I also had their $13 empanadas de pollo con mole poblano which I was very excited about. When I received it though it was covered in oil and had absolutely no flavor. Lastly, I had their carnitas taco which is set at $5.50 and that is the reason my rating is at a 3 instead of a 2. The carnitas taco was the best. The other girls at my table ate nothing but tacos and they both agreed the carnitas was the best. The plates here are very small. If you want an actual dinner I definitely recommend going elsewhere as this place is more like tapas (similar to his restaurant upstairs). If you do come here, just keep ordering the carnitas tacos and take in the unique interior design ;)",

If you are not worried about prices, check it out.

    "text": "My family recently dined here, on our last night of our Vegas family trip for the holiday. We ate practically every meal in the Cosmopolitan (where we were staying) and we were SO pleased with every restaurant we had dined at. Our expectations were high for this one, and we wanted our last night's meal to be special. Alas, it was not.  The restaurant decor was cool, and our waiter was great. After having an amazing meal at Jaleo the night prior, we were really into the \"tapas-style\" of dining, where you get to sample lots of dishes. We were excited to try this Asian-Mexican fusion menu! The first few dishes we ordered, the waiter told us they were out of them that night (ex. Aguachile de Cayo, which I really wanted to try) . So we started with the Beijing Glass noodle dish. The family liked this dish but I found it too spicy (I'm a wimp when it comes to spiciness, I freely admit it). The Happy Buddah Vegetable Spring Rolls were the typical fried spring rolls I've had a million times before. Good, but not unique or special in any way. The Palmitos was a strange \"ensalada\": I did not like this dish at all; it was so bitter and had an off after-taste. The kids weren't keen on it either, but hubby said it was ok and he ate it. The family ordered a few other dishes (I forget the names) that were WAY too spicy for me (and a bit too spicy for them as well).   I hardly ate anything so I asked the waiter, what was the least spicy item on the menu, and I said I did like seafood and fish, and he recommended the Shrimp Mojo. OMG, it was crazy spicy for me, I got rather ill afterwards (I only had one shrimp, too, and I had to scrape off the black peppered sauce). The kids also said it was spicy but they were able to tolerate it ok. Even my hubby, who has a very high spice tolerance, admitted it was quite spicy.   So either the chef this particular night was super-liberal with the peppers and spice and we just hit this restaurant on an off-night, or this place just serves really spicy food in general. Be forewarned.",

The dessert is also amazing, my favorite is the sticky rice with mango but with a twist. This place really surprised their customers. They are very creative. They have good customer service and they are ready to help you with your questions and orders. The place is Beside marquee. They have a comfortable lounge outside while waiting for your seAt and table. The service is fast and the food is incomparable. I will come back here and I will recommend this to my friends.",

I had a Chicken Milanesa Torta (just so-so) and a Al Pastor Taco, which was good but not at all like a normal al pastor taco- was more like a piece of bacon with pineapple on top of it. Service was good. Overall, not bad but not a must-visit either.",

We let our waiter be our guide and worked our way through the most incredible, soft, pillowy steam buns, lobster and pork tacos, flavorful shrimp mojo, sui mai, har gow, fried steam buns, and mango \"sticky rice\".   Everything was full of flavor, inventive, and fun. Our waiter recommended the golden pig (fried) steam buns for last, since they come with a sweetened condensed milk and reminded him more of a dessert, and he was 100% right. It made for a good transitional course.  Will definitely be back. Enjoyed every bite.",

We also had the mini burgers, liked them so much that we ordered 2 more!    We also had the tomato bread or some thing?  Listen, it's Vegas, there were cocktails involved, I don't remember what it was called!  Order it; ridiculous.  We went crazy and then had the fig jam cheese for dessert.  It's $30, and totally worth it!!!",

We also had Gan pung ji chicken its as salty as the eggplant. The only thing i did like is their chips and salsa tasted fresh. Their vegetable fried rice like they said its good give it a 2 stars. sorry but i will never suggest wasting your money here.",

The cocktails (margaritas are topped with salted air which were refreshing and unique) and beers were spot on and the service polished and sharp. However the overpriced food was hit and miss. Sui mai should be avoided (weird spongy texture and off tasting) as well as the weird tasting Dan Dan Mian and the ugly Dancing Eggplant.   Bright spots were the 20 Vegetable Fried Rice (awesome), Unruly Monk, Guacamole, Rou Jia Mo Sandwich and the Queso Fundido. Tacos are 2 bites and are $5.50 for one which I couldn't swallow the price tag so we skipped the tacos. Bill was $240+ tip for 3 people. We left buzzed and full but we'd have a hard time going back except for drinks and maybe a few of the bright spots mentioned above.  If you want killer dumplings and regional Chinese food go to Chinatown. For Mexican food there are loads of more affordable and tastier options off strip.",

Noodles were fresh, and the shrimp and mushrooms were marinated and sauteed deliciously.    For dessert, we had the mango sticky rice. This is unlike any mango sticky rice you've had, but was so good.    Wait staff was superb.  My only regret is that I waited until my last day in Vegas to try!",

It's good to feel taken-care-of, and this makes me want to return. This is service at a level that I would expect at a high-end \"fine dining\" restaurant. (Five stars for Kevin).  As for the food - I only had a couple of tacos, but they were *fantastic*! I plan on returning to eat my weight in Tacos Napoles y Queso. Seriously. These little unassuming tacos are some of the best things that I've eaten on the Strip. Somehow, they've managed to capture the essence of campfire smoke and infuse it into the cheese - making this an amazing and delicious treat for those who love smokey flavors (like me).   The only downer? Price. Granted; it is not ridiculous for The Strip, and from what I can tell, the food quality is very high. But living as we do in what must be the Inexpensive Mexican Food capital of the U.S., I still have trouble paying over $20 (with tip) for two tacos and a small coke - no matter how fancy.   So, I'll start saving now for my upcoming taco bender - but this will have to be a rare treat, rather than a regular thing.  #TooBrokeForTacos",

After we finally hit 45 minutes the host came up to us and said they don't have anything for us and was not sure how much longer it could be. We were not happy and decided to leave the cosmopolitan completely... we drove all the way to the strip for this restaurant specifically. Ended up paying for parking for absolutely nothing. Do not quote 45 minutes and then have nothing in 45 minutes. 9:00pm now, we went to yard house with a 5min wait. It was not an issue to wait the 45 minutes but to have nothing after making us wait was a waste of time .",

We started with some guacamole and a few appetizers and everything was really good. The portions are pretty small so if you have a big group, you will need to get multiples of things. I got one of each of the vegetarian tacos: cactus and beans. Both were delicious! I liked the cactus one the best, but both were quite good. My friend and I shared the Kao Lao Lao noodle and loved it. It was very interesting and delicious! It looked like a honey comb.

We had several different servers to take our order, bring/clear plates and fill water. They were all nice and attentive so it was easy to decide the tip when the bill came. My friend and I shared the carnitas taco, dan dan noodles and lamb pot stickers. The carnitas had a bit of a kick of spice and the chicharones gave it a good texture balance. The noodles were the winner for me especially since it was very peanut forward. The pot stickers were on the small size and could benefit from a paired side sauce.",

We're big fans of Jose Andres, his restaurants, and his food.  However, despite multiple trips to Las Vegas, we hadn't yet dined at China Poblano.  Arriving around a little after 8PM, we had to wait a few minutes for seating at the bar to come available.  After a quick look over the menu, we decided to keep the decision-making process simple and have the Chef's Experience tasting menu ($45/person) with the Cocktail Experience ($32/person).  We received a nice selection of food from across the menu (Chips & Salsa, Tuna Ceviche Spoon, Siu Mai, Snow Pea Leaf Salad Carnitas Tacos, Shrimp Mojo, Twenty Vegetable Fried Rice, and Mango Sticky Rice).  Likewise, we received four, tasting sized (thankfully), cocktails from the cocktail menu (Salt Air Margarita, Ma, Jade Garden, and Mezcal Negroni) representing both Mexican and Chinese elements.  We had also ordered the When Pigs Fly (steamed barbecue pork buns), a supplemental item to the menu, which we didn't receive.  However, our gracious server, brought us a Churro in Oaxacan Hot Chocolate, to make up for the service oversight.  It was completely unnecessary, but much appreciated and a positive reflection of the restaurant's focus on customer satisfaction.  Going the tasting menu route worked well for us to sample as much of the menu as possible without leaving the restaurant uncomfortable full and/or inebriated.  Did China Poblano break any new ground or do anything better than traditional Chinese or Mexican restaurants?  Not so much.  I've certainly had better Chinese and Mexican food elsewhere and in most cases at a much lower price.  However, that's misses the point of China Poblano and why we went there for dinner.  It was a thoroughly enjoyable dining experience that honored both Chinese and Mexican cuisine with thoughtfully conceived and well executed food.  The same goes with the outstanding cocktails.  However, it was the service was the one facet of our experience that truly impressed and set China Poblano apart from most restaurants.",

And they let us order just one (usually tastings must be bought for the entire party)  The 20 veggie fried rice was spectacular.  Everything else was good.  But our waitress was not ok.  She never brought our drinks.  2 times in a row we had to ask.  And she didn't ask how things were.  She kinda ruined our experience.  Lots of options in Vegas to try.  Train your staff better.  Prob would not return.",

    "text": "Tasty spot in the Cosmopolitan, Las Vegas. Went here for lunch- it's a fusion of Chinese and Latin cuisine (classic Jose Andres)  Food: I did the $45 8 course tasting 1- chips and salsa: you can ask for me (we did). The salsa was super unique, smoky, and delicious. 2- Tuna Ceviche on a spoon: phenomenal. I could have eaten all of our spoons. The avocado adds volumes to this dish. 3- shrimp and pork shumai (spelling?): a tasty bite. No complaints other than that this course ended as soon as it started. 4- tacos: I believe they were lamb tacos with chicharron. The chicharron added a nice crunch factor. I really enjoyed this dish. 5- salad. Honestly, not overly impressed with this one. Sure it was a decent salad, but felt like a cop-out. Would've rather had a soup or something. 6-shrimp in a mole: this was to die for. Was enough for 3.3 shrimp each for 3 people. I could've easily have eaten all 10. If nothing else, this and then next dish are musts. 7- 20 vegetable fried rice: surprisingly the star of the meal, my friend and I (all proud meat eaters) could not get enough of this. I have never had so much flavor in fried rice before. Would love to get this recipe. If I can add even half the amount of flavor, it'd be a hit at parties/potlucks. 8- mango sticky rice: wasn't in love with this. Was expecting traditional Thai mango sticky rice (which I really like) so the giant heap of whipped cream on top of some crunchy ice cream wasn't doing it for me.  Service: decent service. Nothing terrible, but nothing stand out. My water was empty a few times and I had to call someone over to refill.  Overall, solid place for some very unique food. Thanks for another great meal, Jose Andres!",

We tried the below to-go:  Bistec Con Mole Amarillo y Hongos  By far the best thing I ate here. I forgot to take a picture of this one but it was cooked medium-rare and the meat was seasoned well. However, I'll have to note the mushrooms were unbearably salty. Get this for the meat, skip the mushrooms.   Quail Egg Siu Mai  Not as egg-mazing. Sigh. I actually didn't particularly enjoy all the flavors bursting together. It was bit overwhelming. I wasn't too fond of the slightly too salty egg in my mouth either. It just didn't work for me, the flavor the taste and the appearance.   Lucky 6(Traditional, Scallops and Beef siu mai)  Overall just a-ok. Nothing that stood out to me that was really bad or a #musthave   We also had ordered the xiaolongbao and they failed to inform us over the phone that it was sold out. When we went to pick up our order they left it out with a quick, \"btw it's sold out.\"   Would I come back? Only if my friends made me.",

    "text": "This is one of my favorite restaurants at The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas. Gotta love the fusion of Chinese and Mexican flavors. The service is impeccable every time I go, the small plate food is fresh, delicious and flavorful! It is pricier than other places (welcome to the Las Vegas Strip!) but it's definitely worth every dollar.  I brought my mom to join me for lunch. She makes her own bomb guacamole, yet she craves the guacamole from China Poblano. You know it's gotta be good! Shout out to the hostess for being attentive when seating us, she was gracious in offering another table right away when we weren't too keen on the first (it was tight fit for us lol)  Please please PLEASE try the table side guacamole! Rumor has it the place might discontinue it, and I say keep it! The server makes the guacamole in front of you, and it was to our perfection of taste. I understand it's more difficult to offer this when it's busy, just have a dedicated person to make it on those busy days. It's such a nice touch that makes the dining experience that much more enjoyable.  Onto the food: we ordered the chips and salsa with the table side guacamole and When Pigs Fly for our main lunch items. The portions are small, they are small plates after all. But we were left quite satisfied with this. The salsa is made fresh, no heat is added so if you like spicy, let your server know! When Pigs Fly is their take on Chinese pork buns. They're Toby compared to what you get in China Town, but the flavor of the barbecue filling is to die for. Plus, the pork is leaner, not much fat which I like.  We ordered the bunuelos and the mango sticky rice for dessert. These are not made in the typical fashion, so keep an open mind when ordering! I won't ruin the surprise, that's what pics are for anyway. Again, the flavors were so delicious, especially that coffee ice cream.  Samantha was our server and she's the best we've had. The food runners and bussers were on their A game, we never had empty glasses, plates were whisked away promptly and even when it was busy, they made the effort to chat a little by inquiring if everything was to our liking. Until next time!",

Let me tell you people.... I have never had a server come out with three halves of an avocado, spices, and MASH ALL THAT JAZZ UP in front of my face! It was like boom bam wham, suddenly the freshest guacamole I've had was made in minutes! The portion was enough for 3 people, and I craved it even after dinner as much as I craved their house made chipotle sauce. YOU MUST GET THIS!!! It's a sin to leave without trying it. Another starter we had was the tuna ceviche which came topped with crispy microscopic balls that added a fun crunch to this fabulous appetizer.   For entrees, we shared their Caldo tlalpeno soup, dan dan mian noodles, and chicken ji song lettuce wraps. Chicken ji song wraps were sooo refreshing and light, the fun crunchy sweet potatoes straws on top were my fav part. The texture of the dan dan Mian noodles was the perfect chewiness, its as if they crafted their noodles in the morning for optimal freshness. Although I got full, I could not stop picking at the last few bites while waiting for the check, cause they were simply just that irresistible.   I don't understand why this restaurant has 3 stars because I think it deserves a five!",

They kindly accommodated my husband's food situation (due to a medical condition, he can't eat raw - so the tuna course was out for him). Good flavor and variety. Would say dishes leans more towards Mexican than Asian flavors. Portions do scale small, so if you are famished you may want to get a snack later at one of the Cosmopolitan's many delicious options.  DRINKS: Full bar menu with a lot of custom mixed drinks. The Jade Garden (an infused tequila cocktail) was particularly tasty.  ATMOSPHERE: It was a bit of a mixed bag.  No white table clothes here. Loud. Boisterous. Think: Upscale Chi-Chi's.  SERVICE: Capable. Efficient. But not, say, super friendly.  COOL FEATURES: If you are dining solo, they bar-style seating near the open kitchen. Thought this was a great option for business and independent travelers.",

The staff were welcoming and attentive, although it was confusing because we had 3 different people come by to take our order. We were only a party of 2.  They have a vegetarian menu upon request, which is really just existing menu items put on one menu. The menu is really for anyone with dietary restrictions and is easy to find what items are for you regardless of your dietary restriction.  The weird thing is that 1 or dishes that were clearly vegetarian were missing from the dietary restrictions (veg menu).   We ordered the Chillaquilles and that was where our regret begin. It was served in cast iron skillet with a layer of cheese so thick it might as well have been lasagna. The corn chips underneath were soggy as a result and this was far from a traditional chillaquilles.  The whole wheat noodle entree was decent but left much  to be desired in terms of taste.   The only highlight as the 21 Vegetable fried rice; satisfying, delicious, and unique flavors with each bite. It also comes with fried tofu, which disappointingly was not friend and was soft and boiled.   Being from DC I expected better from a Jose Andres restaurant. If we had to do it again, we'd order some chips and salsa and the fried rice.",

I rarely eat pork which made it all the more surprising to me that the three variations I had at dinner were all quite delicious! Their won ton soup called Swallow a Cloud ($14.88 & $2 to add egg noodles) was a real winner; juicy pork encased in delicate won ton skin swimming in a full-bodied broth. Put a squirt of sriracha-like salsa on their Chicharrones ($6) & you've got some good crunchin'. Golden Pigs ($14.88) is the name given to their fried buns, the twist being the condensed milk dipping sauce that offsets the savory bbq pork filling.   Enjoyed this trifecta of porky goodness!

    "text": "Truly 3.5 stars at best...I can see why this place is a hit or miss. The menu consist of chinese and mexican food. Great concept, but execution needs to be refined. There's really no fusion of the two either.  I had the posole rojos, which was OK. It was underseasoned and it was missing the kick from the ancho chilies. The pork was tender, the amount of hominy was just right, and the side of fresh toppings (onions, radish, cabbage) gave it a crunch. I think fresh cilantro and avocado could have given it more depth.  On their Special Menu (Aug 15th-25th) celebrating tequila mezcal- includes a margarita flight, mezcal flight and a taco flight.  I opted for the taco flight and the mezcal pairing. Together it was well balanced and and complimented each other. But tasting the tacos individually were again just OK.  I did love the mezcal flight. The La Venenosa Costa smelled like a backyard BBQ and tasted earthy with a hint of smokiness.  With all the food choices, I would go elsewhere. Tip: There's a walk up take out window.",

Though I can't recall the name of the dish I had, I can describe it. I had hand made ravioli-like and sized dumplings, with pork belly meat and sauce inside. The side sauce was soy sauce infused with ginger. I was in heaven.  If you are in the vicinity, I would recommend visiting this Vegas delight!",

    "text": "While I'm a big fan of Jose Andres and I've patronized a few of his restaurants and think what he did for the hurricane victims in Puerto Rico was beyond admirable, I just wasn't able to love this restaurant, China Poblano.   When walking through the Cosmopolitan Hotel near the chandelier bar, one looks over to see a green and red neon sign that simply says \"Mexican Food - Open\".  The neon sign looks like one that'd be illuminated near a Mexican place in a food court-type setting, so that's kind of what we expected to find when we came here.  One enters by walking through an abstract Asian sculpture to find a mashup of a Chinese and a Mexican restaurant, both housed together in the same space, and sharing the same menu.  What's more odd is that the servers in Asian inspired uniforms sometimes serve patrons seated around the decidedly Mexican food counter that features 2 or 3 Latin women working behind it to press and cook fresh tortillas.  We came here for lunch as we were craving Mexican food and saw the neon sign out front.  Once I found it was a Jose Andres restaurant, I was really interested to try it.  As others have said, prices aren't cheap, and they serve mostly tapas and small plates which really are, well, small.  We each had a michelada to drink, which are basically bottled beers with bloody mary mix or lime juice, and those priced out at $11 each.  An order of guac prepared tableside was $16, and each of the tapas/small plates averaged $8.  When we asked for more tortilla for our guacamole we were charged $4 extra.  My partner's coffee was $8. Granted, it was served in a french press, but yeah..$8 for a coffee.    In total, lunch for 2 ran us $84 before gratuity and we left with our hunger satisfied, but barely..Definitely not what I'd consider \"full\".",

We tried their char su bao, their xiao long bao (soup dumplings), Siu Mai with scallops, shrimp mojo, birria taco, and pork taco with sour orange.    My son enjoyed the char su bao, contained fresh chopped bbq pork.  The siu mai was very good, comes with a soy dipping sauce.  The soup dumplings were good and the broth was nice, just thought for the price they could have made a bigger dumpling with more broth, these were definitely not 22 folded dumplings.  The two tacos had very nice flavor, the tortilla was very nice and soft, tasted fresh made, again only complaint is the size to price ratio at 6 or 7 dollars a taco expected a little more.  The shrimp mojo had good flavor was served with rice, the chili served with it had a nice kick and liked the fusion of ingredients in that dish.  Solid food it is in the cosmopolitanism hotel so I understand the pricing, but they need to step up their game either in portion size or ingredients for the money you are paying.",

The watermelon aguas fresca was so good. Just the right sweetness and texture. So refreshing for a warm day.  The wonton soup was pretty good. The bok choy would have bern better if i smaller pieces, broth was flavorful  My fave was the fried rice,great garlic flavor and ecah veggie gives a different texture & taste. Mongolian beef was sweet and sticky, the meat had charbroil flavor and was so buttery.  Great food, not too bad price wise for the location & ambience.

As for the quesadilla, even with the chicharron, Menonita cheese, onions, cilantro, it was a soggy, bland, under-seasoned mess. The salsa cinco chiles did help with the flavor but it wasn't very spicy at all.  All in all, China Poblano isn't for this Chinita.  No me gusta!",

When we were asking our server what we should get, he said that since we were a large group, he could get us a little of everything.  Get to try the gamut? Sure, sounds good. We quickly realized we were being upsold, though, as they have a prix fixe tasting menu that's much more expensive than each person ordering an entree and an appetizer. Beware of that! But wait, it gets better! Turns out we were upsold on the UPSELL because the waiter literally ordered us 2 of each course that he wanted us to try. Thanks, I guess? But the bill was literally hundreds of dollars more than we wanted to spend. Not cool!   Back to the fusion! there is none! Everything we were offered was either Chinese or Mexican, not one thing really felt like a new take on both together that honored both cultures but did something fresh. Oh well. All I can say is the fried rice was BOMB, the dumplings were great, and the beef was well cooked (not well done, well cooked ;) ).  But most everything else was just ok. If you're gonna break down and pay extra for one of the specialty drinks, go ahead and try the \"Swallow the Cloud.\" Besides sounding like rejected marketing slogan for a software company, it was actually pretty decent if you manage to get the salt foam \"cloud\" in the same gulp as the margarita underneath.

Next up ordered some dim sum with sauteed veggies and my sister ordered chicken soft tacos.  Isn't that beautiful!?! Chinese and Mexican-perfect match. The green beans were sauteed with garlic which was mouth watering. I seriously need to try to recreate this at home. Domain was juicy and packed a punch.

Which is the polar opposite of what I believe a noodle should be.  The meat and such on the noodles were also a disappointment. Honestly, it's like they poured canned chili on top of already bad noodles.  As for the pot stickers, they were dry and flavorless. And that is truly the best description I have for them.  The service was also lacking. We sat down and it took about 15 minutes for our waiter to come  back. We actually flagged someone else down to take our order.  Such a disappointment.

    "text": "We atually avoided this place for a while, because the concept of Chinese/Mexican fusion seemed so alien to us! However, we were passing by and happened to see a bunch of dim sum steamers through the window and that totally changed our minds! We are suckers for Dim Sum.   The restaurant is a unique fusion of Chinese and Mexican cuisine and it does it right! The set up of the restaurant is unusual with bench \"comunal table\" type seating or bar style. The first thing we noticed was the very high prices, especially for Dim Sum!!! We come from LA and the OC, where Dim Sum is plentiful and cheap. The Dim Sum menu here is pretty small, and many things are $13 a plate! that seemed crazy, but we thought it might be worth trying just once. And it was- we were not disappointed! We ordered: -Golden Pigs (pork buns) which comes with in-house condensed milk for dipping. These are petite char sui bao that have been deep fried. It was very pricey but it comes with so much flavor and many layers of textures; from the crunchy outer layer to the soft insides to the sweet and salty porky center, all dipped in th sweet and creamy condensed milk sauce. It was a very fresh look at a classic dim sum dish. -Chicken Shumai. These were very small but very tasty and moist and full of flavor and topped with a goji berry.   After two dim sum dishes we decided to share an entre from the Mexican side of the menu: Shrimp with a pepper sauce. These were very tender and a bit spicy but good altogether.   The best part of it all, Dessert! Mango with Sweet Rice....The best we both have had anywhere!! It had a ton of flavor in every single bite. This restaurant is probably getting that 5th star just because of this amazing dessert. It is like nothing you have ever had, I promise. First, the rice is cooked in coconut milk and reduced to a near liquid, and is then whipped into a light and airy mousse like texture. At the center is a mound of icy, sweet, mango granitas and the whole thing is topped with cramalized rice crispies and chunks of mango.  The service was also very personalized. The wait staff and even the bar tender chimed in with their favorites when it was obvious we couldn't make up our minds.   I'm not going to lie. The portions, at least of what we had, are somewhat small, and the price is high, but I think the quality and ingenuity of the fusion menu make this an experience not to be missed.",

The Chinese dishes come from one kitchen; the Mexican dishes come from another.  But they're completely separate concepts mishmashed into one (loud) restaurant.  Nothing blew any of us away...but the check sure did.  I gather that it's supposed to be served tapas style...but I'm pretty sure that takes away from part of what I love best about eating Chinese and Mexican foods: over-indulgence on the cheap.

    "text": "My estimation of celebrity chef Jose Andres hit an all-time low after having dinner at his restaurant China Poblano located in the Cosmopolitan Hotel in Las Vegas. When an internationally known chef puts his name of a restaurant one expects a certain level of well prepared food and professional service. Neither of these things exist at this restaurant which led me to ponder whether Mr. Andres had ever visited his own restaurant to sample some of the food here.   This restaurant features a unique idea of combining Mexican and Chinese dishes existing in tandem on the same menu. Unfortunately this fresh take on offering two different cuisines on one menu does not materialize on the plate. We ordered a variety of dishes from both the Mexican menu and the Chinese menu starting  with Guacamole which was so heavily seasoned with lime juice as to make it off-putting and unappealing. The pork belly and pineapple taco, served in a flimsy and very small tortilla (5\" diameter), was layered with one tiny shaving of pineapple so thin you could read through it and an equally thin shaving of pork belly with a dab of red sauce and a shred of lettuce. I could go on and on about the equally disappointing Chinese dishes we ordered but I'll spare the reader. As a final word, I've had better Chinese food from my local strip-mall Chinese take-out joint for 75% less money. My advise: avoid this place. The quality of the food is poor and grossly overpriced. There are other wonderful restaurants in the Cosmopolitan to enjoy.",

    "text": "I first tried Jose Andres Mexican food in Washington DC. As a Mexican native used to authentic Mexican food, I was not expecting to be impressed. I first noticed that the menu included Mexican dishes not commonly found in Mexican restaurants in the US, which compromise the authenticity of the food in order to appeal to most people. I realized that this place was for people who appreciated real authentic flavors.   I asked for tacos de cochinita pibil fearing that I would be disappointed since last time I had eaten these tacos was 16 years ago in Mexico. To my amazement, as soon as I took the first bite, it brought me back to those flavors of Mexico. It was as delicious as I last remembered.   Of course, when I found out about China Poblano I couldn't wait to try these tacos again. They were as delicious as they were in Washington. It was like food heaven!!    I've haven't tried his Spanish food nor the Chinese food. I've heard that Jose's strength is actually Mexican food and I believe it. I've become a huge fan of his Mexican food and I just hope that one day he opens a restaurant in Chicago so he kicks Rick Bayless' butt as his food is soooo much better!!",

    "text": "It hurts to write this review because I have been to Jose Andres' restaurants in Washington DC and I have absolutely loved them and had great experiences with his food.  However, China Poblano was absolutely terrible. My husband and I tried items from the Mexican AND the Chinese menu and while the Mexican was slightly better, everything we tried was awful. Everything on the menu is tapas sized, so you are expected to order 3-4 items per person. Luckily we decided to start slow..We had a number of different tacos (lobster, fried fish and mushroom) and all were greasy and tasteless. The guacamole and chips (which was $15!!) was ok. LIttle did we know that it would be the only truly edible thing we ordered! We then decided to try some Chinese items and got some traditional shu mail dumplings and mongolian beef stir fry. The dumplings had a bizarre raw pork flavor to them that was so disgusting that I actually couldnt even swallow the dumpling and the mongolian beef stir fry was completely bizarre... tiny little chunks of grisly beef stir fried with pieces of romaine lettuce?! And then the icing on the cake was the bill.. I know this is Las Vegas and I certainly wasnt expecting a budget dinner, but since we ordered very little food (4 tacos, an order of guac, the dumplings and the beef) and only ordered two agua frescas and no alcohol I was absolutely FLOORED when I saw that the bill was over $100!   Definitely skip China Poblano-- if you want to try Jose Andres' fabulous food-- go to Washington DC... because you certainly won't find it here at China Poblano!",

As a general rule, I come to Vegas prepared to spend cash, so I'm not going to dock this place for being ridiculously overpriced relative to your traditional Mexican or Chinese restaurant. $4-$5 per taco and $22 for a seafood noodle dish may seem steep, but I'm ok with it if the food is top notch.   Unfortunately, China Poblano fell short of expectations. The Al Pastor taco had very little pork belly and was overwhelmed by sauce. The portion sizes were small across the board. The guacamole was pretty good, but then again, it's pretty hard to screw up guac.   I would not dine here again nor would I recommend it to others.",

We were greeted warmly by the hostess, and our waiter was prompt to the table.  The menu is unique with both Chinese and Mexican options.  They recommend ordering a variety of foods and sharing.  I looked around the restaurant, and when it was time to order, I used my classic, \"I'll have what she's having,\" technique, pointing to dishes that looked good, and asking the waiter to identify them before making my final decision.  Since it was just me and my husband, we limited ourselves to chips and salsa (generous portion--only $4!), an assortment of tacos (price range $5-10), and dan dan mian, a spicy pork and noodle dish.  The $10 taco was actually lobster, which is reflected in the price. I would highly recommend this restaurant for groups (or couples) who desire casual dining in a fun and colorful atmosphere, but don't want to spend the extra money at some of the other finer dining options on the 2nd and 3rd floors of the Cosmo Hotel.",

The hostess seemed a bit flustered by our request, but did let us eat at our own table after offering us the bar instead, which we declined.    We tried the chips and salsa, queso fundido, langosta tacos (lobster), and mongolian beef lettuce.  The best part of the meal was the lobster tacos.  They were actually very tasty, although on the small side.  Everything else.... not what I expected from such a well known chef.  There's just not much to say besides it just being mediocre food.  Both of us decided it was not the memorable meal we were expecting.  With all of the dining choices at The Cosmopolitan, I will certainly try another option next time.",

Not to mention its a decently priced restaurant by the famous chef Jose Andres! My mother and I split the mushroom hot and sour soup and the 20 vegetable fried rice. That was probably the best hot and sour soup I have ever had. The soup was very flavorful and the mushrooms and pork complimented the broth perfectly. The rice was also nice. We liked it so much that we came back for dinner and ordered the hot and sour soup again, the shrimp mojo and the tuna ceviche. The shrimp mojo was very good - it was stir fried with sweet black onion and poblano pepper so it was very tasty. The tuna was also great. It was a very nice cut of tuna topped with amaranth seeds, soy sauce and pecans which made a very good yet unique dish - not your average tuna ceviche! I would highly recommend ordering all of those items because they were all very good and flavorful. Only complaint about this restaurant is the service. The restaurant wasn't overly crowded but both times we went the waiter was slow to take our order and didn't check on us much. The first time he went he forgot to put an order it yet never apologized for it and was not very friendly. But I would highly recommend this restaurant because the food is so good and the prices are decent.",

    "text": "Fortunately or unfortunately China Poblano is located on the second floor of the new, cool, hip Cosmopolitan hotel right across from the Marquee nightclub entrance.  If you don't like large crowds, this is unfortunate, if you like to see a lot of pretty people dressed in their sexy Saturday night bests, which is what you should expect when you even think about going to the cosmo, you will feel right at home.  I wasn't expecting much from China Poblano after reading all the negative yelps, but I was pleasantly surprised.  You cannot go to a high end Chinese or Mexican restaurant ready to compare it to the tastes and prices of hole in the wall joints in Sgv or East LA.  That is the problem of a lot of yelpers out there.  You have to realize your surroundings, you are in a high end hotel in Vegas and a Jose Andres restaurant.  You should know what to expect in prices, but you should also know you are getting good fresh ingredients and beautiful decor.  And last, you need to try the food with an open palate and not expecting the tastes that you grew up with at neighborhood restaurant.  Here's what I tried:  Carnitas taco - excellent Barbacoa taco - good BBQ pork buns: different, but good, no your typical fatty pork Shu Mai: again different, but good Ha gao:  ok Glass noodle salad: excellent and refreshing Mole fries:  not too good Queso fundido with chorizo: excellent Chicken and rice soup :  spicy but good  There are also two food bars you can sit at, one has a view of authentic Chinese people making dim sum and the other has Hispanic people preparing guacamole and other yummy foods,  which I thought was pretty cool.  We had a great meal and good service, definitely worth a try, and I will definitely be back.  Just be prepared to eat with an open mind and an open wallet, lol..........",

If there's a chef behind this business, he's probably happily retired because there's absolutely nothing good.  The chips and salsa: chips are salty with the seasoning they pour over it.  The fresh drinks (aguas frescas): ran out of all of them except for the guava drink which was okay.  The fried wontons: okay, but who can really mess-up a deep fried food?  The Arrachera Steak: you can definetly find a much better Mexican cut steak at your local mexican store - this one was medium rare and very rough to chew.  The Chipotle chicken soup: overly salty and served warm! The 20-veggie fried rice - $24 if you add chicken: overpowered by the sesame seed oil, okay with the cucumbers and radish in it.  The churros: crispy from the outside but undercooked from the inside...it's not filling, just uncooked batter!  Service was very friendly and accessible.  Tables were so close together that you feel you're practically sharing a table with the people next to you.  Place looks trendy and has good loud music.  Will not go back ever.",

China Poblano was no different and is now my favorite of all of his restaurants (I've previously been to Zatinya, Oyamel and Jaleo in DC).  I went in December of 2012 while staying at the Cosmopolitan.  It is a very casual place with a fun, relaxed vibe.  We ordered the Golden Pigs (lightly fried BBQ pork buns served with condensed milk) and Har Gau for appetizers.  My boyfriend was skeptical of the milk being served with the buns but they were delicious!  The perfect combination of sweet, savory and salty.  For our entrees we ordered one carnitas and one lengua taco which were both perfect in every way.  The waitstaff was quick and friendly, the food amazing and the prices extremely reasonable for Vegas.  I am returning to Vegas in July and this is the first place I am seeking out for lunch.  I would highly suggestion that every one give it a try.  You will not be let down.",

They're about $4.50 each which seems like a lot, but I think it's reasonable for good quality food on the strip. Everything is a la carte, so I'd recommend the chips and guacamole too.

    "text": "I'm a Las Vegas food and wine writer by trade, so I learned a long time ago to take the good with the bad and focus on writing about the positives of a dining experience while ignoring the variables that can sometimes detract from an otherwise solid establishment. However, I feel that my most recent unpleasant experience at China Poblano requires me to issue a warning to future diners, and that is to STAY AWAY. Seriously, avoid this place and save your money. I used to absolutely love this place, the food was fabulous and unique, the drinks were delicious and creative, and the ambiance was festive and hip. The service has always been aloof and full of bad attitude (Save for a delightful bartender named Steve who was there when they opened but has since moved on to more hospitable pastures.), but I chalk that up to the general attitude of the Cosmopolitan - which generally has the worst service on the strip across the board. Since they opened, I've chosen to overlook that and make this my go to for entertaining clients and out of town guests in a casual setting as it really did have top notch food and a cozy atmosphere. Alas, that is no more. It's been a couple of months since I dined with them, and apparently there has been an overhaul on the menu. The dishes are still tasty, however they have downsized many of them to tapas-like portions while keeping the prices the same (they were once reasonable, now they're typical strip mark-up). This was irritating, but not shun-worthy. That was reserved for the service that has gone from disinterested to disdainful. Our server, Richard, I admit had a sweet personality and an adorable smile - that is for the two minutes when he greeted us and took our order. Once he did that we literally never saw him again until he brought us our check. This was not his fault, he was clearly the only bartender on duty. Why they had him waiting tables as well while the bar was busy was beyond me. My companion and I each ordered salads. Her, the beet and avocado (which was my favorite until now - it's been pared down to a tiny fraction of what it once was.) and I the tuna ceviche (which could have been excellent had it not been drowning in an over abundance of lemon and soy). The pathetic excuse for a beet salad came out a full 10 minutes before my ceviche did. I waited for our server to notice, even attempting to flag him down, but he never bothered to come over. I finally stopped the tall, bald corpse of a manager (you'll know exactly who I mean if you see him) to ask if perhaps I might get my lunch before my companion finished. His response was a dippy 'Well, ya know we have two kitchens so stuff doesn't always come out together, your server should have told you that'. That is the single worst excuse I've ever heard, and frankly, as I learned as a server many years ago it is unacceptable to EVER take out only part of a table's order. Not only was the service terrible but the manager was so annoyed that his diners would dare to ask to receive their food at the same time that he couldn't contain his disdain. I feel just awful that I inconvenienced him so by intruding upon his establishment to order food. I felt that unwelcome. No matter - I will never take another guest there again and I hope to save many a dear Yelp reader from wasting their hard earned dollar on such nasty service and portions of food fit to starve a hamster. I will happily (and very vocally) never ever darken China Poblano's door ever again.",

It's pretty much a Chinese Mexican fusion restaurant. But the portions are very very small at Las Vegas prices. It's anywhere between $7-10 for 1-2 pieces of taco if you're lucky enough and all the portions are tapas style...meaning to fill up the average person, you'll need at least 3 dishes.  Their waiting staff is fantastic when it comes to the explanation of how the restaurant works and the dishes as well as being very attentive. In addition, all the tortilla's are made fresh which can be seen in a daily basis. I'd rather eat at Holsteins, at  least I know I can get full off of a burger and  shake...but we go where the bachelor wants to go.",

    "text": "Let's start with the good stuff about China Poblano:  - Super cute and trendy decor, we had such a great time noticing the small details around us as we waited on food.  It almost feels like dining in an eclectic art gallery, fun.  - The service was pretty solid, not rushed nor too pushy -- but very attentive with water glasses filled at all times, friendly rapport and helpful suggestions.  - The drinks were interesting.  Not strong or obsess about the cocktail menu until you return amazing, but definitely stood out above most of the rest of our Vegas beverages.  In particular, the Blood Orange Chile Pequin Margarita  had a unique flavor (not as spicy as we'd like it, but that's not unusual as we're freaky about our spiciness) -- and the Salt Air Margarita was an experience.  But now for the food....  It was just 'meh'.  Probably lower than meh... 'eh'?    I love fusion cuisine and small plate dining as much as the next food geek, but for the price and build up everything really fell short.  The chips and tortillas tasted store bought (or crappily made, if actually done in-house), the ceviche tasted borderline 'off', even the queso fundido was barely mediocre (who knew you could mess that up).    For the price and the buzz we heard, it was a total let down.  A great meal and a couple of nice dinner drinks are priceless in our household.  But this particular dinner for two set us back around $160 and was instantly regretted.  We stopped elsewhere to grab a (much tastier and filling) bite before heading back to the room for the night.    My advice:  grab a drink and enjoy the vibe, then move on for dinner.",

I had no choice. I made a reservation on opentable. A few days later they called me to take a credit card down since we had a party of more than 8, fine. A few days after that I randomly noticed that they dropped my reservation to 5:30?! If I had not noticed that we would've lost our space... wtf. Thankfully after I called, they were able to change it.   They also had a set menu which was all shell fish and pork and had NO substitute options. Two of my guests couldn't even eat half the food. One of my friends who is allergic to shrimp, accidentally ate some and they didn't have benedryl on hand... that should be standard for a restaurant. I asked for them to comp her meal and they kindly agreed to do it, but after we paid I noticed that they charged for the makeshift substitutes they served... wow thanks for nothing!

The Dan Dan Mien noodles ($12) were thrown into a big plastic tub containing 90% air and 10% food. It came out to the equivalent of 5 noodle strands, mixed in with a few pieces of meet, vegetables, and put into a big container to give the illusion of generous portions. The Langosta Tacos ($10) and Carnitas Tacos ($4.50) were the size of my index finger - no joke.   Rarely do I ever order food and feel so jipped-off and demoralized.   Aside from the highway-robbery prices, ridiculous portions and nasty food, the worst part was perhaps that the waitress recommended these items to us.   *** China Poblano and the ownership/management, and even Cosmopolitan should be really ashamed of themselves. My experience was nothing short of criminal and I will NEVER go back. ***",

    "text": "Really really really wanted to love this. I came in with high expectations, especially because I am a fan of Jose Andres's style. He is creative and has a vision that is unique in the restaurant world. The kitchen needs to see his same vision.   The layout of the restaurant is stunning. Two bars upon entry (left and right) and your in direct sight of the dimsum preparation and steamers. There are creative cocktails to choose from, & the bar has an embedded part of the design to hold a spoon...then dissapointment began.  Without being longwinded,  Salty! Over priced! Really dissapointing!   This was the order: Viva China* soft beef tendon/ Kumamoto oysters/scallions/ Sichuan peppercorn sauce -- it was one tiny taco, this was my only tasty thing but the price was a serious turn off for the size. Pescado Frito fried fish/ ancho chile pickled onions taco-- again just OKAY, doesn't justify the cost. Beef 6pc beef/lime/ daikon/ watermelon radish --DIMSUM, I've had better. AND the clincher Shrimp Mojo 8 pc shrimp/sweet black garlic/roasted poblano peppers--Salty  I don't know if the kitchen was off that day but I rarely send things back and the salt content was so powerful we just had to say something. We got the dish made fresh again and sad to say, nothing changed.  Our bill was approximately $110 and it left us starved for a second meal that wasn't going to leave us with high blood pressure. I understand that good quality will justify higher priced cuisine but these portion sizes were abnoxious. They should even slightly up the price and give us two tacos instead! Eating with your eyes is the first step to the dining experience and that left us hungry.   I will definitely continue to visit Jose Andres's other projects but will stay away from China Poblano in the Cosmo when Blue Ribbon sushi satisfies me a lot more in the same price range!!",

    "text": "Chinese food and Mexican food in one - what more could you ask for?  I'm honestly pretty shocked about the lack of positive reviews for China Poblano.  It's Vegas - everything is expensive and probably not big enough (insert double entendre here).  Stop your whining and realize it's tapas-style.  If you have 10 hungry bachelorette party girls like we were, order two of each type, eat family style, order a strong drink, and shut your trap.  For Vegas shu mai, I thought it was pretty good.  We ordered two servings of the Lucky 8, which I recommend so you can get a taste of each type of shu mai they serve. All were tasty and topped with something interesting, like radish or goji berry. The har gau was ok; I have had better. The Don't Be Jealous hot and sour soup had a wonderful kick of spices. Drinks ordered included the Singapore Sling and the Lychee Sour, both of which were flavorful and interesting. I myself had vodka with fresh cantaloupe juice, which snuck up on you and hit you like an unruly child. Other dishes ordered at our table included a caesar salad (with way too much parmesan), When Pigs Fly, shrimp, and numerous tacos. As far as pork buns go, the When Pigs Fly was a little meh. I like the pork to be red and drier than this was.  The coup de grace of my palate was the Viva China taco. This is definitely the best non-traditional taco I've ever had. A taco with beef tendon and oyster - the crispiness of the tendon punctuated with the creamy oyster was mind-blowing.   Lots of good tastes, a few mediocre tastes. But definitely deserving of a higher rating than the uno estrellas some other folks are giving. I'd go back.  Viva China Poblano!",

As the meal came to a close, I was nodding my head in approval, but then the bill arrived, and I realized I was still a bit hungry. I don't think the prices were insane; they just add up quickly.   I love the atmosphere, as if you're walking into the LSD trip of a luchador on a dragon boat. The waitress was notable in her attention to our questions regarding dietary restrictions. If you have a dietary restriction, they take it seriously, which is always a good thing to know. However, our water glasses did remain empty for a quarter of the meal. Nothing worth complaining about too loudly, just an odd disconnect between the quality of service we initially received.   As for the food, we started with some good ol' chips and salsa. Why? I am not sure, but I would resist. The salsa was a-ok, but didn't  thrill my buds. We each had a taco. I went for the pastor with thinly sliced pineapple, and the pork belly was good, but I thought the sauce could have gone in a different direction. It overpowered the lovely pineapple.  The two standout dishes were the chilaquiles, a must if you adore cheese, and the snow pea salad dressed with citrus. I confess it was my first time eating snow peas raw, and I find this a distinct upgrade on a lettuce salad. It is quite stemmy, but I don't care.  Will I return? For a sit down experience, probably not, but I may have to roll up to their to-go window just for the hey of it. I just like the idea of ordering a Jose taco to go from a window.",

Combine them all together and it creates this harmonious bliss of magnificent food and dining.  I am so sad that we only came here for lunch so I only was able to sample a few items. Thankfully, Vegas is only 5 hours away from San Diego and I will be sure to  eat at China Poblano the next time I visit!  Firstly, I just love the ambiance of Jose Andres' restaurants. They are worldly, fun and adult at the same time. Between courses I was entertained by watching the pictures on the wall change from Chinese and South American peasants to Mao Zedung.  The margaritas we ordered were spectacular. While I was tempted to order the margarita with the salt air (to brag about the pretentious \"salt air\" LOL) I went with the blood orange chile pequin margarita. It was balanced, but SUPER strong. One was enough to start my Vegas party blood pumping!  My friends and I ordered a variety of tacos, which were all fantastic. I am a sucker for carnitas. While I have no shortage of those tacos in San Diego, none of them are topped with chicarrones like the ones at China Poblano! It added the perfect crunch to the perfectly cooked and tender pork. The carnitas weren't overly salty as they can be at other restaurants.  We split the Dan Dan noodles that came with black vinegar (oh black vinegar, how I love thee) and were so delicious. The guacamole was rich and flavorful. I love that it was served with tortillas and not just chips.   My favorite dish was the Siu Mai with quail egg. I have grown up eating Siu Mai - it is among my top favorite dim sum dishes...holy crap China Poblano's Siu Mai was amazing! The quail egg on top was so perfect (see my picture). The yolk was runny and gave the already delectable Siu Mai flavors an extra kick.   China Poblano, I will be back!",

The chicken with lettuce cups was the winner -my brother got them and thoroughly enjoyed them- whereas the rest of the food was mediocre at best. The portions were incredibly small and overpriced. Avoid the lotus leaf sticky rice unless it is something you know you like - all 6 of us tried it and it was (and no exaggeration) rather disgusting.  To top it off, our server Corrine rarely checked our table and we waited about 30 minutes before we could flag her down to pay for our bill. The kitchen staff operates differently and they bring out your food as it is ready so if you want your group to eat together, half of your food will be cold. The ambiance is unique and nice given the restaurant's 'Chinese Mexican' style but I would not come back nor recommend it to anyone trying to get a cost effective guaranteed good meal. Would have been one star if not for the chicken Ji Kung.",

From the hostess, server, all the way down to the manager that took our order stay away from this restaurant at all costs if these are the same conditions you're visiting.   I took my grandmother that has recently lost her husband to walk the Strip, the Bellagio fountains and enjoy a nice meal. Low and behold we end up at the Cosmopolitan and I recommended this venue that I'd gotten tacos from once.  We weren't even really sat down - it was more \"oh are you planning on sitting there?\" And then while waiting around for service I had to get up and ask what seemed to be the manager if someone was available to take our order since the place was dead anyway. Another 10 minutes later he comes out and says he'll take the order and he recommends some dishes that seem okay.   They come out pretty quickly which is probably the only redeeming quality about this place - applause kitchen staff. The Lucky Dim Sum and wonton soup were pretty good too. But the beef and lettuce dish was too salty. I asked for the server who finally showed up to come switch it out and he comes out with a plate that just has less soy sauce. Come on - I'm Chinese my people might be cheap but we're not dumb.   I specifically ask for a box and check and the guy comes out another five minutes later with water... At this point even my 74 year old grandmother is complaining because there was literally no one else in the restaurant.   When he brings the check over he asks if I want change. And I say yes. In my opinion - that is one of the rudest things a server can ask. Do you think you deserve a tip? And even so, it's not required. He huffed and puffed his whole way back to the cashier and made some racial remarks I'm sure about me and my grandmother being Asian.  And you know what? For a $53 - here you go Mr. Greedy Server a $20 tip. Maybe you'll learn next time not to judge your service based on the customer.   If this is how it is on a slow day - just imagine when it gets busy.",

We read reviews and heard what people said was good. The negative reviews where some of the wilder food items or items that didn't seem good in general. Here is what you should try.  The lotus chips sounded odd but got good reviews. They were tasty. I couldn't taste the anis which was good as it's not my favorite flavor. They were like yucca chips when burnt and had a slightly unique flavor when less fried. Very good. The carnitas taco was amazing and one of the best tacos we've ever had. The pork rinds were a nice crunchy addition. The when pigs fly was also very good. My wife had never had dim sum and loved it!  The ants climbing a tree noodles were spicy and delicious.

I'd been to Jose Andres' Bazaar in LA so I knew this place would be pricey but probably worth a try. The dishes are actually pretty straightforward and tasty upscale versions of Chinese and Mexican street food. By upscale I mean gold leaf flakes on the dumplings, oyster in a taco, etc. and tiny portions.  Our group got to share: - Sui Mai (Traditional 6pc  shrimp/pork/water chestnuts/mushrooms/peanuts) - Dan Dan Mian (hand-cut wheat noodles/spicy pork sauce/peanuts) - Coctel de Camarones (fresh shrimp/jumbo lump crab meat/tomato/avocado) - Papas Fritas (fried potatoes with mole poblano/Mexican cream/queso fresco)  And I got for myself in addition: - Viva China (soft beef tendon/Kumamoto oysters/scallions/Sichuan peppercorn sauce) - China Paloma (tequila reposado/house-made grapefruit lavender syrup/soda)  I'd have to say my fave item was that Viva China taco! The beef tendon was perfectly crispy/chewy/fatty and the oyster added an extra dimension to the flavors--very good! All told with others ordering a drink of their own everyone's share came to about $35, which is pretty dang pricey for small bites. The service was also decent so I thought it was worth a try, but next time I'll probably save my $$ for other places.",

This is adventurous food in a casual setting where it's all about ingredients and technique.  It is NOT a fusion restaurant as there are two kitchens serving both cuisines side by side.  This place is exploding with unique flavors. I tried two things I'd never had in my life here: beef tendon and duck tongue (both in taco form). The tendon was just a bit too greasy for my taste and came with a raw oyster on it. The combination just wasn't my favorite.  The duck tounge taco was surprisingly yummy and served with lychee fruit.  Definitely you MUST have the quail egg and pork shumai. My friend ensured me it would change my life and it did not disappoint as it exploded in my mouth, like a tiny contained eggs bennidict.  The pork belly is wonderful as well and a bit safer as a taco option.   I would have given this place 3 stars for the items that fell flat, but the Salt Air Margaritas make it impossible to give this place less than 4.",

Extremely knowledgeable about the food. His description of our desert was excellent. The outside decor is weird and we walked by wondering if this was some cheap fast food.. Almost did not go in.. but the hostesses were nice and helpful and we gave it a try and do not regret it, on the contrary. But this level of cuisine, even if deemed simple, deserves a better decor. Highly recommend it when you are tired of the crowds, long waiting time in the fancy restaurants. Will visit every time I come to Vegas on business.",

    "text": "The trickiest part of this Chinese/Mexican fusion idea is that as much as the Chinese dishes sound interesting, hold back your temptation and just get their tacos. Open up your mind and tastebuds to eat like a real Chinese person, AKA not to say eww at everything.   Came here three times (2012, and twice in 2015). I'm going to ignore 2012 because that was when anything edible was good. Part 1 of 2015 was after hearing good things about this place from a friend for decently priced meal. Ended up getting the Beijing Glass, which is like a cellophane noodle salad that looks like a bibimbap, and a side order of Viva China taco, raw oyster taco. Noodle was basically a disappointment, bland, took too much work to chew or pick up. The taco however was packed with various tastes and textures. You have this soft taco shell with a thin crispy beef tendon, and this piece of Kumamoto oyster that's on the sweeter end and not meaty. It's a good 3-4 bite of surf and turf.  Came back another time and only got 3 tacos and split the Siu Mai sampler. Had to go back to my Viva China, discovered my new favorite: Silencio (duck tongue and lychee, sweet and savory), and Pancita al Pastor (pork belly, pineapple). The pork belly one was tender, but not too memorable. For those who are hesitating to try the Silencio, if you can eat lengua, it's just more chewy in texture. The sauce is similar to the one you eat with Peking Duck, the lychee is just a refreshing component to throw your taste buds out of the box. Fusion does work when it comes to Asiany tacos! Yes, the tacos are pricey, but how often do you find some fascinating combination of ingredients? Siu mai sampler was a disappointment, the dumplings were fairly small, traditional one wasn't even as good as your local dim sum restaurant's, the best one was the scallop. The thrill and enjoyment of that 1/3 good dumplings wasn't just as luck as they were called on the menu....",

Guacamole - absolutely DELICIOUS. even in a to go container, I can taste the freshness of all of the ingredients. As well as the freshly fried tortilla chips.   Traditional Sui Mai - a little different from actual traditional Sui Mai but still delcious none of the less.   Rou Jia Mo Street Sandwich - No comment. Because I never received this with my order and I'm truly upset about it.   After receiving my food, I grabbed by bag and rushed back to Venetian as I had to get ready for the night. When I reached my hotel, I opened by bag and I only had those 2 out of the 3 items that I ordered. Frustrated, I called the restaurant back and spoke to the \"manager\" on duty. (5:10PM, Saturday, December 17, 2016)  He asked if I wanted to come back and get my sandwich but I told him I was all the way at Venetian and it would be a major inconvenience to go back. So he offered to give me a refund so long as he spoke with the person who gave me my order. However he told me that said employee had already finished and left their shift. I asked what was the appropriate thing to do and he said he'd call me back tomorrow after talking to said employee. So he took my number.   The next day came and absolutely no phone call whatsoever. On top of that, I still paid for the sandwich.   I understand that the restaurant is busy but taking a costumers money without giving them their complete order is practically fraud. As a costumer, I deserve better than this. I hope that others who come to enjoy this restaurant receive better than this because from what I had, the food is great. The customer service however (be it a one time mistake) was not. It could have easily been resolved but it wasn't. And this is why I am still upset.",

In actuality, you can order dim sum and a taco at the same time here.   The Mexican food was flavorful. The guac was perfect balance of cilantro and onion and avocado. The homemade salsa had some kick and their Mexican meat was tender.   On the other hand, the sui mai I ordered was a big disappointment. It was almost to the point of raw and tiny compared to typical dim sum restaurants. I didn't like the fact that I just had guac and then took a bit of dim sum after.   The biggest reason I'm giving this place 1 star and never coming back is the seating arrangement. The tables are about a foot away from each other and when I went, the place was near empty and the hostess still sat a group of men at the table right beside us. We were so close to them that the guy beside me flicked me with his menu turning it over on accident twice. There were empty tables behind me and behind my friend. The only excuse we got was that they like to close half the restaurant.",

When Pigs Fly buns were drenched in salty bbq sauce, dan dan mian was the frickin' same. My first shrimp taco was very good, was the only thing I approved of so I ordered 2 more. WRONG MOVE, they didn't come out looking like the first, they were drenched in some disgustingly overpowering orange sauce that tasted like melted salty cheddar. Even their fresh guacamole that was made in front of us was salty... and the chips were already salty enough to begin with. Done. Never again.",

    "text": "I had visited China Poblano a few years ago on a visit to vegas and had such fond memories I had to go back. I love all of Jose Andres' DC restaurants so naturally I had to visit one of this Vegas restaurants.   There was no wait for a party of one to get seated at the bar (30-45 minute wait for parties of 2-4). Sitting at the bar is the way to go if you are dining alone! The bartender was very attentive, he quickly took my drink order and made suggestions for my food order. I personally love the salt air margaritas (I opted for pomegranate, yum!). The foamy salt never mixes with your margarita so you just get a lovely taste of salt with every sip, less salty than big chunks of salt on the rim of the glass in my opinion.  The Bartender said the Dan Dan Mian was one of their most popular dishes and that the shrimp mojo was a personal favorite so I went with those 2 items for dinner. I really enjoyed the Dan Dan Mian, the noodles were the perfect texture and it wasn't too spicy for a spice wimp like me. The serving size is a little small so you may want an appetizer to go with it. The seasoning on the shrimp was really delicious, though a little on the salty side.   I'll definitely be back, hopefully I won't be traveling alone next time because there are so many dishes that would be great for sharing!",

    "text": "This has become one of my favorite spots in Vegas! Mostly because Mexican & Asian food are my top 2 favorite cuisines. When you walk into China Poblano, to the right is an open kitchen and you can see their staff making food for their Mexican dishes such as fresh tortillas and fresh guacamole. To the left is another open kitchen, where they are making some of the Asian foods such as dumplings, dim sum, etc. You can either sit at the counter which looks into the open kitchens or in the dining area, which has plenty of small tables, as well as large tables for big groups. The restaurant is very colorful. Mostly red color and has a lot of interesting decor, big portraits, and fun lighting.   99% of the reason I come here is for their Asian food! They have great selections of siu mai which were all very flavorful and tasted authentic. However the 2 dishes I ALWAYS get when I come are the Golden Pigs and Dan Dan Mian. The Golden Pigs are great if you like chinese bao buns. These are like bao buns that are taken to the next level! The buns are filled with chinese bbq pork, and then fried. It is served with a side of condensed milk for dipping. To sum it up, you are pretty much eating a bbq pork donut. Yes it sounds strange, but I've forced all of my friends to try this dish and they all go crazy over it! It is the perfect combination of sweet and salty and fatty and fried. Great hangover food. And their Dan Dan Mian is the best Asian noodle dish I've ever had. The noodles are hand-cut wheat noodles, with spicy pork sauce and peanuts. So addicting! It is pretty much like a spicy, Chinese version of bolognese. And the spicy pork sauce has a szechuan kick to it, so you'll definitely get a hint of smokiness to that dish. I love it!  However the only reason I gave this place 4 stars instead of 5 is because I was disappointed with their tacos. People that love Mexican food will usually order tacos off of this menu since they have a good variety of tacos to choose from. However for $5-$6 PER TACO, I don't think they are worth the price at all. I ordered the Tinga Poblana taco and didn't taste any chipotle flavor. And the chicken had a weird texture. It was almost too mushy, like tofu. At one point I wondered if I was even eating chicken. It didn't taste at all like I was expecting it to. I also got their Refried Bean taco and there was barely any chipotle salsa on it. The tacos also weren't that good which was a let down, since they are made fresh in the restaurant. I've definitely had better tacos at other places. However their fresh guacamole is spot on! I will definitely get guacamole when I feel like eating Mexican food here.  I'll definitely be back, but mostly for the Asian dishes. The Mexican dishes can use some improvement in my opinion.",

Not only was the food a huge letdown, the service also sucked! The waiter was not friendly and kept pressuring us to buy the most expensive items on the menu. I love both Chinese and Mexican foods so the concept of the restaurant had a lot of potential, but China Poblano definitely didn't deliver on the culinary experience. Unfortunately, the only things going for this place are the cool/weird decor and interesting concept.",

    "text": "Stopped in the Cosmopolitan and were looking for a different style restaurant to try and we came across China Poblano. We had looked into Jose Andres' other restaurant but it exceeded our budget a bit and we saw this place we thought it would be a fun place to try. Hostess was really nice and made us a reservation for later that night. We did have to wait a little bit for our table when it didn't look particularly crowded later on when we came back, but nothing to really complain over.   Service: was good. nothing extremely noteworthy but I felt like they checked in on us frequently enought and the food was out in a reasonable amount of time. Our waiter sugessted some of his favorites and overall I think the service was nice.   Cocktails: I had the Lemon Drop which is a \"noodle\" inspired cocktail that comes with chopsticks. I didn't love it and for $12 a pop I wanted to love it. After a few sips the noodles got to be annoying and it was a little too sweet for my taste and I like sweet.   Food: we ordered some appetizers. Got the lamb potstickers Stuck on You. I liked them but I wish the lamb had a bit more flavor to it. Needed more seasoning of some sort. For my entree I got the Ocean Nest which is scallops/shrimp/king crab/lobster/pan-fried egg noodles/ seasonal vegetables. Heads are on the shrimp so if that freaks you out its good to know before hand. I really loved the broth of the dish and the whole thing all together, but it was really difficult to eat. By that I mean you can't look cute eating what looks like a birds nest of tightly wound noodles, especially with chopsticks.   I like the setting of the restaurant. It's a nice space. I would come back again but maybe try the Mexican half of the menu.",

The golden pigs were awesome. They had sweet tender pork filling with a hint of 5 spice ( I think) and came with house made sweetened condensed milk which was delish. There at 4 to a serving..but they are filling. The when pigs fly were the same filling..only these were steamed..not fried golden..and came with no dipping sauce. I was pleased..but would have liked a dip!  Second trip I ordered the 18 monk noodle.. And took it to go since I was solo..I guess it was because I took it up to my room..but the noodles were a bit dry..and the portion was a tad bit small. One stand out that I had both times were the pork carnitas tacos. The filling was super juicy and came with two chicharones inside. I could have eaten 10.",

What we got:  Rainbow Congee. Amazing especially after a late night. Easy on the stomach and very flavorful thanks to the sausage (there are snowpeas and carrots in there too, so you've got your daily veggie instake). At $8.88, very cheap for five-star hotel restaurants and the serving size is quite large.  Carnitas & fried fish tacos. Tasty but rather small. Us girls easily consumed 3 tacos each and guys can probably do 5 no problem. At $5-6.50 per, that's quite expensive for just tacos.   Caesar salad. Taste like Caesar salad everywhere else, but $12 for a very small serving.   Nothing spectacular, but everything we had was well prepared and the takeout server was very friendly and helpful. The restaurant isn't very large so this is a great place to get some take-out for in-room dining.",

I can come back only for this!! the quail egg Sui Mai was very refined and you can really taste a True meaning of Asian Fusion. The wonton noodle soup is just a very ordinary but overpriced noodle soup. Not recommended.  viva China taco was the worse of the meal.

It came so steaming hot that I'm surprised the server's hands weren't on fire. The handcut noodles had a good texture and accompanied by a really tasty broth and the tiniest serving of XO sauce.  Pretty good attempt at homemade XO.  It added the perfect touch to the already rich and comforting broth.   A bit pricey, at almost $18 for the bowl, but you're talking about and Andres restaurant on the Strip.    Those fearing asian fusion fare will be relieved to know the fusion is minimal. There is a Chinese side and a Mexican side, with some dishes borrowing from both cultures.  Again, an indulgence, but curious to go back and try the dim sum and tacos.  Didn't hurt that Jose was wandering around, in town for some celebrity asian chef-fest.   Wish it was a bit more casually priced, but still a tasty meal. Bring some amigos to share.",

Our server said he'd bring them out slowly for us (we ordered all at once) and we were out of there in about an hour which is not a leisurely meal in my opinion.

My pork wasn't shredded enough, but most people at the table said it was good. Arrachera con Salsa Molcajete? Damn good. Skirt steak was a little rare, but I understand that you can't cook this too much. Tuna Ceviche - DELICIOUS! I've never had better ceviche. Not in Miami or SF. This was the best I've had. Fried Rice was just okay.  If I were to go again, here are the items I might order again: Tuna Ceviche - for sure! Chicken Ji Song - probably. Arrachera con Salsa Molcajete - maybe.  I think I would try avoiding the Chinese food more and going more for the Mexican.",

Top Ramen tastes better than the soup I ordered, Swallow a Cloud ( Hong Kong wonton/shrimp/pork/bok choy ).  The wontons were the only things I ate.  The noodles were undercooked and did not absorb any flavor from the broth.  It is not worth $17. The Traditional Sui Mai was delicious.  The price was $13 but it's probably because they were sprinkled edible gold flakes.  I'm sure I wouldn't have tasted any difference.  My friend had a couple of the tacos and said they were pretty good.  Unfortunately, I can't remember which ones.  I think one had carnitas or pork belly (a special).    I expect to pay a little more for dining in Vegas.. but for not this type of experience.  I will not give the restaurant another try.",

    "text": "It was a Saturday Night and we met up with my bro-in-law and his friends.  They were eating at the counter, first come first serve (I think).  Luckily, 5 minutes after chatting, 2 people got up so that we could sit. (Bonus points for the purse hooks under the counter!) (Since China Poblano is located across Marquee, it was crazy to see how long the line was at 8:00PM!!)  I'm only rating on a few items, because that is all we had to try.  We ate a good brunch and some Sam Woo (boo) mid-afternoon..so we ordered only 2 tacos to try.  I ordered the Pancita al Pastor Taco:  slow-cooked pork belly/ pineapple $5.50 - I ate it in 2.5 bites! It was okay..NOT \"GOOOD\" like I was hoping.  It didn't really satisfy my tastebuds.  But the way they sliced the pineapple long ways and so thin was interesting.   I did not feel that the taco was worth the $5.50.  My hubby ordered the Viva China Taco:  soft beef tendon/ Kumamoto oyster/scallions/ Sichuan peppercorn sauce $5.50 - done in 2 bites!  He said is was VERY SALTY!  Someone orderd the Papas Fritas with mole poblano / Mexican cream / queso fresco.  Nothing to rave about.  Just fries with the mentioned above ingredients. The best thing I tasted there was the Salt Air Margarita.  Think Margarita Martini with a Salt foam topping instead of Salt Rim.  Very eye catching too!  A few weeks later, I found out, to my surprise, that my Mom's favorite Chef, Jose Andres owns China Poblano - which made it a little more dissapointing.  The decor of lights, changing LCD picture frames, bicycle wheels was really different and neat.  I don't know that I would come here again - because by the time we go to Vegas again, there will be more and other places to try.  PS.  What's with the warm tap water??  You would think they would have \"normal\" ice water.",

There are a few foods here (like the signature Rou Jia Mo Street Sandwich) whose ingredients I couldn't quite decipher (maybe braised pork belly with char siu???) nor find in another restaurant.  And they have a fried quail/rose petal menu item called \"Like Water for Chocolate\"! (I'm a fan of the movie).  However, the overall taste was disappointing.  The pork filling in our street sandwiches was salty (even when eaten with the bread).  \"Swallow A Cloud\" (which was really just a wor wonton noodle soup) was also salty, and I thought that my favorite Chinatown restaurant did a better version (cheaper too).  When served with tea, we were advised to give it a few minutes to brew... I wish I ignored it because by the time I poured it out, it was too bitter.  The lunch was very expensive compared to the experience I got.  I don't mind paying $30/person for lunch, but I think I deserve to be guaranteed at least a satisfying dining experience at that price.  PS: Even though I was a fan of \"Like Water for Chocolate\", I decided not to order the namesake dish after tasting the foods they started serving us.  It was about $15 to the already bloating check and I didn't want to risk another possible disappointment.",

Not to mention, a Chinese woman making fresh noodles in one window while a Mexican women with her tortillas in another window.  The menu made me just as curious - fancy tacos.  Each taco between $4-6, but with ridiculous combinations.  I tried:  Viva China - Kumamoto steamed oyster, beef tendon, Sichuan sauce - the beef tendon was absolutely delicious with a wonderful crispy/chewy texture, but it was unfortunately overpowered by the oyster.  Two strong flavors that battled it out, but didn't come together in the end.  Carnitas - Deliciously braised pork complete with large chicharrones, perfectly complemented with a salsa verde - I could have had a few of those..   Also had the Chilaquiles off the brunch menu - reminded me of super soaked nachos with a fried egg on top.  The table loved it.  Huitlacoche Noodles - for mushroom lovers only, but if you love mushrooms and quite a hefty amount of spice - you'll love this dish.  They fail to mention the chiles in the dish.  Chips & Salsa - the smoked flavor was strange at first but I grew to enjoy it.  Salt Air Margarita - a very delicious margarita  in which case they salt is in the foam making each sip perfectly balanced.  The service was great, the ambiance makes it a great lunch/brunch place.  Overall, a good place to try if you're near the Cosmopolitan.",

It is pricey but a good bargain by Las Vegas strip standards.  I enjoyed the 20 vegetable fried rice.  It gives you an interesting combo of flavors.  The pork sandwich is a winner, as is the langosto taco and the pan fried noodles.  Is it truly authentic: no.  If you are looking for dim sum or True Chinese or Mexican cuisine you will be disappointed.  However, it you enjoy creativity, and a restaurant willing to push the envelope with a fun atmosphere this is a great place.  I look forward to returning!",

I had something with the number 18 in it. Smelled awesome. Tasted pretty decent. We shared the When Pigs Fly and it was ok.  I wouldn't tell anyone that they HAVE to go there.

It is drowned in sauce that overpowers the shrimp itself, and the sauce isn't even all that good. It was especially disappointing because we weren't going to get it, but our waitress said it was to die for. It cost $18, but shouldn't have been more than $5.  If you go with a big enough group (3 or 4 people), it's probably better to make your own tasting menu than to pay the $55 or $75 for their tasting menu. We as a group of 4 just asked them what was on it, got all of that except for the guacamole plus several other dishes, and could not have been happier (except, of course, with the shrimp). The best things we had were: Tuna Ceviche, When Pigs Fly, Lamb Pot Stickers Stuck on You, Dan Dan Mian, and Mongolian Beef Lettuce.  Can't wait to come back!

My only questionable fusion item was the mezcal negroni, I think aperol and mezcal are one of those things that shouldn't end up in the same glass.  All in all though, great service, delicious food, and cool decor (the wheels are from food carts).",

Our server started off a bit unenthusiastic but once we engaged him in conversation, got him talking about the food he was great! Definitely order a variety. All small plates and reasonably priced...after all it's Vegas! We ordered a little of everything...tacos, dim sum, steamed buns, chicken wings...All was delish!  Chilirio de puerco taco A+ Carnitas tacos A+ Viva China  taco A When pigs fly B+ Scallop siu Mai A+ Had gow A Gan pung ji chicken wings  A+ Lamb pot stickers stuck on you A  A little noisy but overall 4 1/2 stars. Definate must try!  ***note to management*** ditch the pictures of Chairman Mao. He is a murderous communist POS who is literally responsible for the deaths of millions! Not kitschy. Not cool.",

The small plate style and open atmosphere is unique and vibrant.  Almost every dish caused my mouth to water.  The dim sum/potstickers were incredible, barring the fact that the steamer was broken and the Har Gow and Xialonghao were unavailable (hence 4 instead of 5 stars).  The drinks were mixed perfectly and the service was beyond expectations.   Having only tried the Taco de Cameron, i can only imagine how amazing the others must be!  This was a great experience and one any foodie should so indulge!",

Our waiter was attentive and did explain that the portions were small and we might want to order more than we did.  The food we ordered was good, but not outstanding. Our orders came at 2 separate times.  It was a good thing we were sharing our plates.  The cons: Very small portions--small bites and expensive.  The shrimp mojo was good, but presentation was off-putting--a black glob of food in the center of the plate. Wine menu choices are average.  In summary, it was an average meal, but overpriced.",

I almost didn't come on this visit but was tempted by the Social Hour (happy hour).  I was catching the late night red eye back home so I had plenty of time to kill after my conference ended.  I had the Instead of a Phone Call cocktail as I did not like the ones offered for Social Hour.  It was a good choice.  I had the Sticky Wings and Rou Jia Mo Street Sandwich.  Then, the ladies working in front of me started making fresh tortillas so I knew I needed to have some of that goodness and added a quesadilla.  There was another gentleman also taking advantage of the Social Hour and ordered similar to me.  I wish I asked him how the fried wontons were.  As it was, I was just glad I came to the realization that I was going to be at the airport for hours and packed up all the leftovers for another meal later.  It was just as good later as when first served.  But, I had to stop.  My plan was to hit up Jaleo before leaving and I had to leave a little room : )  Yummy!",

    "text": "A creative concept, but execution is mediocre.  Honestly, the idea of a Chinese and Mexican restaurant usually would have me running in the opposite direction (I HATE fusion places), but the Jose Andres connection really drew me in. This place isn't a fusion restaurant, it's really just a bunch of Mexican and Chinese options.   My sister and I got: chips & salsa, 2 tacos (hongos & pancita al pastor), 1 order of Dan Dan Mian, 1 order of Swallow a Cloud (wonton noodle soup), and 1 order of Golden Pigs (fried pork buns with condensed milk dipping sauce).  The chips and salsa were okay - salty chips but good chipotle salsa. The tacos were also okay; the hongos (mushrooms) one was way too citrus-y and could've used more guac to balance out, and the pancitas al pastor (pork belly) was good because of the pineapples in it. My sister did say that the pork belly could have been a lot more tender, though. Dan Dan Mian was not good. The noodles were off, and the peanut sauce was salty and too spicy even after adding the vinegar brown sauce on the side. The Swallow a Cloud wonton soup was also mediocre because of the bland noodles. I think the winning dish was Golden Pigs - who would have thought condensed milk to dip fried pork buns into is actually really yummy?   The concept is creative because there are a lot of options, and the drinks menu looked good, but the food itself was just mediocre. Maybe coming from California set the standard high for Asian and Mexican food, but this place was a little too expensive for just the mediocrity.",

Unfortunately, not everything on the menu is equal. It was 50/50. Half of our choices were 10/10 for taste, presentation and creativity. The other half was disappointing, and not what we've come to expect from Jose Andres. Favorite items of the night were the nopales taco and the golden pigs. Most disappointing was the Mongolian beef. The jury is still out on the XO noodles. My husband described them as interesting and ended up finishing them. I took two bites and did not want to go back for more.",

I'm not picky so I figure why not let the staff send out the best that the menu has to offer! Every dish was absolutely delicious. A few of the dishes I tried included the chilaquiles, golden pigs, all the siu mai, tuna ceviche and for the kill.......PALMITOS!!!! Everything is certainly worth trying but the palmitos....I simply do not have words to describe how perfect it was. It was so fresh and the flavors combined seamlessly to create a delectable bite every single time!  Dessert was also fantastic, though by the time we got it, I was pretty full so I couldn't finish either of them and I cannot remember their names. It was a grapefruit one, and another one with a coconut whipped cream and chocokrispies!!! I think I'll eat less food next time to save more room for dessert!   The staff was attentive and knowledgable! Our server, Josue, checked on us throughout the meal and chatted for a bit here a there, not intrusive at all, which can be hard combination for a server to nail down when you're in full blown girl talk at a table!  The cocktails were also wonderful. I am hesitant to drink tequila or mezcal due to previous unfavorable encounters but I left feeling very happy! The manager, Edgar (tall, dark and handsome btw ladies!) touched the table, which I love seeing at restaurants because it simply completes the experience!  I am looking forward to going back very soon to try everything else that I didn't get around to this time, however I will have the palmitos every single time!   ENJOY!",

    "text": "I like Jose Andres, Chinese food and Mexican food.  Put them all together you'd get something spectacular, right?  Well, at least that's I hoped for.  The service at China Poblano was good.  I loved the interior.  Images of Mao, Frida Kahlo, the Dalai Lama, etc. projected on screen on the walls - nice touch.  I had the Jasmine Downy Pearls tea and it was amazing.  It was fragrant and it tasted good.  It was a neat idea that they give you a timer so you get to enjoy the perfect tea whether you like it mild, medium or strong.  We ordered a bun of different things from the menu:  Golden Pigs: 4 fried BBQ pork buns with a side of condensed milk.  Dipping pork buns on condensed milk might seem pretty odd but it works.  Sweet and savory just go well together.  5/5  Rou Jia Mo Street Sandwich: A braised pork sandwich.  The bread tastes just like biscuits but the filling's saaaalty. If you look at the menu, you'll see \"Rou Jia Mo Street Sandwich\" in a box which will make you think that's their specialty.  Honestly, I hated it. 1/5  Tacos (Carnitas, Langosta, Viva China, Pescado Frito): The Carnitas came with pork rinds on top but the pork in the taco was dripping in oil.  Just let the oil drip off your taco and you're all set. Great taco variety. 4/5  When Pigs Fly: 4 steamed BBQ pork buns. Yep, that's all I can say about that.  Nothing special. 3/5  Lucky Six Siu Mai: 2 scallop siu mai, 2 beef siu mai and 2 traditional siu mai topped with itty bitty pieces of gold leaf. 3/5  Papas Fritas with Mole: I wanted fries with my sandwich.  I had to pick between mole and XO sauce.  Fries + XO sauce just doesn't seem appetizing so I went with mole.  The mole was overpowering.  There was a scant amount of Mexican cream and queso fresco.  I can usually finish an order of fries but not this one. 2/5  Queso Fundido with Chorizo: Again, nothing special. 3/5  Mango Sticky Rice: This was the best thing on the menu.  Instead of using sticky rice, they used puffed rice so you get that nice crunch with a nice creamy coconut sauce and semi-sweet mangoes. 5/5  Chocolate Terra Cotta Warriors: The name \"WARRIORS\" is misleading because you only get one warrior made of chocolate filled with chocolate mousse on top of cookie crumbs and ginger ice cream.  It looks like something just died on my plate complete with dirt and flowers.  The presentation was just too funny but this chocoholic wasn't 100% pleased with the taste but the creativity was there. 4/5  Cajeta Flan: A flan made with goat's milk served with salted caramel ice cream and pineapple chunks.  The flan was mild and the salted caramel ice cream was just lovely. 4/5  So why 3 stars?  For the amount and type of food you get vs. the price, not worth it.  It's like they grabbed the queso fundido from Viva Zapatas, steamed BBQ pork buns and siu mai from Spring Mountain, fish tacos from Rubio's for like $3 each and decided to serve it to you for double or triple the price.  Part of what makes Chinese and Mexican food great is that they're inexpensive.",

    "text": "So yeah, after a girl's night out on the strip, I woke up and was starving at 10a.m. on a Sunday. A friend and I ventured out together to look for some food to nourish my belly. We found this spot randomly while walking around the Cosmo, and got enticed into eating here thinking that starchy foods (rice and noodles) with some greasy (mexican) would be the best fit for my physical, mental, and emotional state.    I got the crazy nachos topped with a fried egg, because who doesn't like some greasy food to coat the stomach after a hard night of drinking. It was their attempt at a \"fancy\" gourmet chillaquillas. It was mehhhhhhhhhhh. Even my desperate hung over state couldn't appreciate this.   I shared some shiu-mai for 13 bucks, and that was a disappointment. We also split some tacos (barbacoa and cochinta). Barcacoa was whatever, but that cochinta was quite unforgettable. It had some crispy pork that gave it a nice crunch. The toppings were amazeballs. I'd skip everything and come back for this one taco.   I think I drank about 7 glasses of water, because it tasted sooooo dang good. I totally thought it was some special water, only to find out from the waitress who said, \"Oh, it's just tap water.\" Yeah, that was embarrassing. The food was overpriced, but those 7 glasses of water kinda sorta made up for our meh brekkie meal and hefty $50 bill.  Next time I come back, I'll be ordering two Cochinta tacos and drinking 10 glasses of TAP water.",

    "text": "Odd. Strange. Weird. Abnormal. Disorientingly bonkers. That is how I would describe this Jose Andres' concocted \"fusion\" restaurant menu-melding both Mexican and Chinese fare.  There's actually TWO sides to the menu, Mexican and Chinese. This is not a fusion restaurant in the sense that the dishes are an amalgamation of both cultures and flavors, this is actually TWO cuisines co-existing on the same restaurant menu.  We came here for a dinner, pre-clubbing in Vegas. The location at Cosmopolitan is nice, easy to access (2nd floor pavilion near Marquee night club). We had a big party of 10 and made a reservation, were seated within 15 minutes of our arrival. We had a few energetic waiters/servers and they explained the concept and threw out suggestions.  We all deiced to order and share...so people began ordering...Mexican tacos, guacamole, tuna ceviche, empanadas...and Chinese pot stickers, 20-veggie fried rice (my choice), cold noodles, etc.  We ordered a LOT of food. I think I tried everything, and you know what...NOTHING stood out...NOTHING was \"oh my god good\" and it was surprisingly bland, surprisingly meh, and surprisingly not all that filling. It just didn't do it for me.  Weird concept, bland food, confused and concerned taste buds and tummy, HUGE bill (like $600 huge), and we all didn't feel like we ordered and ate $600 worth of food and drink.  It was suffice to say...a MISS...and we should have gone to some other concept place like Mesa Grill, etc if we had really thought of it...only nice thing was proximity to our first club of the night...this was not what I have heard and experienced from Jose Andres' and we all left very disappointed.",

    "text": "I must have amnesia because I really don't know why I keep coming back here. My first time was when it first opened a few years ago, and I believe I have a review for \"the worst thing I've ever eaten\" see: beef tendon taco w/ bad oyster. About a year and a half ago I went back, and was again taken aback by the incredibly mediocre food and astronomical prices.   A few weeks ago a friend and I were prowling the town, looking for a fun spot to grab a bite before we headed to Drais for Chromeo (woo!), and she'd never been, and again, I guess I blacked out momentarily from hunger, because I was like \"okay! let's go here!\". WRONG. It was empty per usual... even though it was 9pm on a Friday night. We each ordered a blood orange margarita at $15 a pop, and they didn't even have the courtesy to fill them to top of the glass. We split the queso fundido, and there was nothing fun about it. It was a glop of starchy melted cheese. A 5 year old could make it by literally putting a block of monterey jack in the microwave. A very expensive block of $10 cheese.   I had the special, a pork belly taco w/ pineapple at $4 which was nothing special at all, and the Dan Dan Mian Noodles for $13 which were spicy, excessively sweet, and quite glue-y. She had a bowl of noodles as well, and somehow our bill came to almost $100 w/ tip. WHAT.   Jose Andres- what are you doing. You are amazing, Jaleo is amazing (the one in DC is 10x better), Bazaar is amazing, this restaurant is a stain on your reputation. The only pros are the service, which is always great, the manager did come over to see how things were, and we said great, because it's not her fault the food sucks. The servers are attentive as well. The first time I was there I saw Mario Batali eating in the back in his famous orange crocs, so I suppose that's cool. All this experience did was remind me why I avoid strip celebrity-name restaurants.",

I've been home for 2 days and I'm still not over my experience at China Poblano. It all started to go downhill when the waiter showed up to the table and was extremely rude. Everyone working there besides ONE guy looked extremely pissed off. The experience began to get worse when we ordered some over the \"popular\" salt air margaritas. The \"salt air\" tastes like a whole can of salt hitting your tongue. Then, the chips and guacamole came and they were not too bad honestly. We also ordered a queso dip that was pretty good if you like salt because I guess a can of salt is a popular trend at this restaurant. The only other thing that was good was the $20 fried rice which was absolutely not worth the price. But wait, there's more. I ordered a quesadilla and asked for chicken instead of pork and was told that they could not put the chicken in the quesadilla and they could only give it to me on the side. Um okay? Once again the can of salt trend appeared in the quesadilla. But the WORST part of it all was the chilaquiles. Dear god do not order these. PLEASE JUST DO NOT. My mom ordered this and I decided to take a bite because they didn't look half bad. Oh boy was I wrong. I took one bite and I bit into something that resembled rubber and had the worst taste imaginable. I still think about it and tell everyone about it because it was that awful. Then we got the bill and it was nearly $200 so that was concerning. I cannot exclaim enough how absolutely awful this place is. The best thing about this place is the decoration but don't let it reel you in to this disaster of a restaurant.",

My BF brought be here recently to eat their tacos. I must say it was one of the BEST tacos I've had and I LOVE soft tacos from trucks to stores. Their Carnita taco was SO GOOD. The meat was very very soft and moist. It just shreds so easily. The sauce was sweet and a very soft hit of lime which was PERFECT. I also had the chicken taco was to me was just okay. The chicken tasted good but the sauce was a little to strong for me. I also had the Al Pastor. The meat was also again SUPERB. The slice of pineapple, at first i was skeptical, but they complemented the meat so well. YOU MUST try that one. We also had the hot and sour soup. It was again very delish. It wasn't the typical hot and sour soup that has A LOT of pepper it was more sour in a differen't way. The chicken pieces were cooked to perfection. It was so soft and moist. Easy to eat. My favorite was the chips and salsa. The salsa to me was either a hit or miss with people. Its either you like it or you don't because it has a some particular strong flavor. I LOVED it. I kept on eating it and my boyfriend just stared at me. This is a place you def need to try. Although its a bit on the pricey side what isn't in Vegas?  and you ARE IN VEGAS! WHY NOT! just do it! :)",

    "text": "I enjoyed some of the food and drinks at China Poblano, but I am baffled as to what the fuss is all about.  My biggest pet peeve with this restaurant was that it is pretentiously creative.  I agree that the concept of Chinese and Mexican food served together is an interesting (and successful) one, but then it goes too far.  For example, I ordered gazpacho, expecting some semblance of a cold vegetable soup.  When the waitress brought a fruit plate with orange juice drizzled on top, I assumed the kitchen had made a simple mistake and tried to send it back.  She explained that it was, indeed, gazpacho.  But where was the soup?  She said that the orange juice was the liquid (but literally, the juice was squeezed on like you might squeeze lemon onto a piece of fish...there were only a few drops).  Call it a fruit plate, but don't call it gazpacho.  Gazpacho is a soup.  This was not soup.  The same thing happened with dessert.  I ordered the mango sticky rice and, behold, there was not a single grain of rice on the plate.  The waitress proudly proclaimed that it was \"their take\" on sticky rice, which was really a milky reduction with some mango puree.  If it had blown my mind flavor-wise, I would have been fine with it, but as it was it was a weak little dessert and the texture was slimy.  Also, unless you're dining with only one other person, the concept of sharing at this small plates restaurant will be frustrating.  I spent a relative lot of money on a not-too-substantial amount of food.  Plus, the carnitas tacos were too salty.  The service, too, was unimpressive.  Our waitress completely forgot to bring a drink my friend had ordered, and the servers were repeatedly bringing the wrong dishes to our table.  Everything seemed disorganized.  I loved my margarita, the salt breeze margarita (served with a delightfully light and airy salt foam on top).  I also loved the guacamole.  But, really, I can find good margaritas and guacamole at plenty of other places in Vegas.  On the whole, China Poblano was a disappointment.",

I love both Asian and Latin food, so what better two to fuse together?!?'   I was surprised when I realized it was \"casual dining\" because the description on the website made it sound very upscale? Either way, I wasn't disappointed!!!   Because I was in a hurry, I sat on the barstools that oversee the kitchen so you can actually watch them make your entire meal from scratch. Spoke to the Asian guy sitting next to me who confirmed that everything was VERY authentic (I'm not familiar with some of the Asian dishes they were serving). I couldn't decide on any of the noodle dishes, so ended up with the chicken/rice/avocado soup (don't remember what they called it?) and a chicken taco with mole sauce. Both delicious!! Service was excellent as well! I thought it was a little pricey ($9 for soup and $5 for one TINY taco) but you have to expect that in Vegas! I would love to try many more things on the menu!",

    "text": "First off, we were robbed. Apart from the way overpriced food, I was surprised to see that someone forged a generous and undeserved 30% tip on my credit card bill, when I clearly left 15% on the receipt. Second, the food was mediocre at best. We started out with a couple of their signature cocktails which were fun and creative but not worth refilling our glasses with. The waiter was kind and willing, however his recommendations all fell flat on the palate. While the food was beautifully presented the taste was not impressive at all. We started with the Carnitas tacos which were bland and extremely oily. Next came the Lamb potstickers. The lamb filling was also not seasoned. Lastly we ordered the food network recommended 20 vegetable dish and added shrimp. Again the protein was bland and unseasoned. While the rice was somewhat tasty, it was not something to rave about. At the conclusion of our meal, we were somewhat shocked to see an $85 bill for the amount and quality of food that was ordered for 2 people. Despite the disappointing food, our waiter was nice and returned to our table multiple times to check on us. I believe this was mainly due to the fact that our order took a long time to arrive. Nevertheless I tipped 15% and clearly wrote the total of $100 on the receipt. Well, when I checked my bank, I noticed the 30% charge instead. I will be calling the restaurant today to dispute the issue. China Poblano is overrated and overpriced. Coupled with the billing issue, the overall experience was very disappointing. Needless to say we will not be giving it a second try.",

We tried this one on a Sunday afternoon and should have turned around as soon as the snotty hostess  seated us next to the silverware station when very few of the tables were occupied. We asked a few questions about the menu and were told, \"You have to order bunches of them.\" Tacos were $10.50 to 5.85. After seeing the tiny taco at the next table I ordered the shrimp and ham with cellophane noodles. My wife ordered salt and pepper tofu. What I got was a small bowl of tasteless soup with two shrimp, that I had to de head, and some tofu. My wife got four small pieces of tofu on a plate. Without drinks we spent $40 dollars and were hungry and angry we'ed been had.",

So we went.  Thoughtlessly!  Two stars for the super nice service, but the food was on the blech side of meh.  Tiny, overpriced for the size and very boring.  Our soup was so salty that I couldn't eat it.  My piglet hubby finished it for me, he is a wonderful man.  The server said that the soup comes from a mix (I'm paying $15 for soup from a MIX? WTF!) and that they must have added even more salt when they were sending it out.    I feel like I was totally ripped off.  In Vegas you pay a lot of money for mediocre food.",

Had a salt air margarita which was FABULOUS. ordered a few different dishes: tacos - pancita & carnitas, noodles, something from the dim sum menu and chips with guacamole. The food was good. The ambiance was fun. The bill and the margarita were truly the highlights of the dinner. Check it out as an option for upscale fast food if you are at or near the Cosmopolitan.",

Like many of Jose Andres' other restaurants, China Poblano serves small plates.  Thus it is possible to try many dishes in one sitting.  On my visit, I sampled, among other things, the steamed pork buns, the Queso Fundido, the Shrimp Mojo, the Tuna Ceviche, Cochinita Taco, the Barbacoa Taco, and the Lucky 8 Sui Mai Beef.    The Queso Fundido, the Shrimp Mojo, and the Cochinita Taco were superb dishes that stood out above the rest.  The Queso Fundido is wonderfully rich, as one would expect, and is accented well by the spicey chorizo.  The Shrimp Mojo had a nice harmony of flavors between the garlic and the roasted poblano peppers.  And, the Cochinita Taco is everything you would hope a slow cooked pork taco would be.    While the three fore mentioned dishes deserve specific attention none of the dishes I tried were bad.  By mixing and matching between two very diverse cuisines, China Poblano keeps things interesting and should have something that appeals to everyone's palate.",

However, I have a special place in my heart for Jaleo since I have now been to three of them.    This place was awesome.  The decor is super casual and friendly.  There are some cool displays throughout that attempt to define the fusion aspect of the restaurant.  In Chef Andres own word's \"we must build bridges not walls with our differences\".  There are a various array of choices from both Chinese and Mexican small plates.    The setas taco, the lengua taco, and the silencio taco arrived at our table in such a rapid succession I was instantly transported to a blissful world of flavorful bliss. The sea air margarita was so light and refreshing I had to marvel at its creation.  No doubt about the True genius behind the cuisine at any of Chef Andres's restaurants, but this one feels as though they are really trying go the extra mile.   The staff was so down to Earth and friendly.  They know that their menu is unusual and are more than willing to work with you to figure out the best choices for your group. The manager even stopped by our table and asked us how everything was going and if we needed any help with anything.  This was not done in the lame, corporate makes me do this at least twice per hour, kind of way but in a way that really showed how dedicated this staff is in creating an excellent dining experience and memory.  I have been a fan of Chef Andres for years, and will be for years to come.",

This place sat us (burger place was supposed to call on the cell when table was ready & NEVER did-lmfao) so we sit @ the dim sum side(mexican side had more life to its side) where three very focussed dim sum makers bang out sheet pans of something wrapped in dough.

The service was excellent, especially considering it was 8:30 on a Saturday night.   The food was outstanding and came quickly (but without any sort of rush). I had the Arrachera con Salsa Molcajete - absolutely delicious - with a side of their freshly-made tortillas (to make my own fajitas, awesome suggestion by the server).

There's a slide-show on the wall with authentic Mexican & Chinese people. There's also some kind of crazy light-show with the emperors head floating in one corner of the room.   I wanted to drop 5 stars for this place, but the service was just ok. When i ask a server for a reccomendation, I wanna hear some \"oh you gotta try the ...\" and see some backward eye-rolling. (ok, i'm a little over the top, but that's what you gotta do for the 5 stars)  Drinks: My brother had the Margarita Sal de Gusano which was pretty cool. The salt was a layer of foam floating on the top of the drink instead of on the rim.  The Lychee Sour was perfect for me. A play on the Pisco Sour, this one had Lychee puree in it.   Food: The chips and salsa were deeelicious. The guacamole was good for the tummy! The Seta (mushroom taco) was okay When pigs fly (pork bun) was good. I'm used to the pork a little sweeter. Traditional Sui Mai was my favorite! It's actually sprinkled with shavings of gold! I didn't know gold was edible, but the waiter assured me it was.  Dan Dan Mian was really good. Not to spicy and a good portion.   Jose Andres never disappoints!!!",

Here is what we ordered and my thoughts:  Chilaquiles con Chorizo - Best Dish We Ate, Flavors Were Amazing Huevo Motuleno - Not Bad But Pork Belly Overcooked When Pigs Fly - Yummy Dim Sum, Try It With The Habanero Salsa Barbacoa de Res Tacos - Juicy & Flavorful Setas Tacos - Good Concept But Messy  Overall the food was good but not great. The place is a little over priced as well. If you want a quick snack then definitely go by here and try the tacos.",

I'd recommend sitting at the bar which is a little less overly-drunk-25-year-old crew and more focused on the food and being able to talk to the person next to you.  Service was friendly and attentive both at the bar and table side.  Things that were good: salsa, when pigs fly, lamb potstickers stuck on you, shrimp mojo (that sauce tho!); things that were ok: langosta (lobster) taco, open sesame noodles with shredded chicken (I've ordered this on both occasions, it's good the first few bites, but not a lot of it), tuna ceviche (this was a huge letdown, bc I love a good ceviche).  The server also recommended: swallow a cloud (didn't get bc we didn't feel like a soup, but sounds great), golden pigs, but haven't tried them yet.  Drinks are generous and thoughtful.  A little loud at the table, so probably would sit at the bar again.  Good for groups as well.  Have a drink at the chandelier bar afterwards.",

    "text": "Not impressed at all. After a long night, you just NEED that noodle soup. Since I'm staying in the Cosmo, I noticed this place and performed a quick Yelp. Ive noticed most of the reviews mentioned the service was lacking and the food is good. I had a complete opposite experience, buy anywho. Eddie my server went through the menu and I explained to him all I really want is the noodle soup so he guided me to swallow in the cloud (their version of a Hong Kong wonton soup).  Great, I love wonton soups. So for the price the portion is small. Which I get, branded by a chef and I am in Vegas. The first thing one should do when they are handed noodle soup is to sample the broth. I'm not sure how they make their broth, but I might as well have drank water.  The broth was tasteless  and unsatisfying. To make it a little better, I had to use ALL the chile sauce that accompanied the dish. Which is fine because I enjoy spice, but what about the next person who cannot handle spice?  Anyways, the noodles was overcooked. It lacked the chewiness that noodles should have. Everything else was tolerable.   The only saving grace from me walking out was the server who served me. Eddie thanks for making this meal tolerable.   No Bueno.",

Drinks: I got some sort of lemondrop with jelly \"noodles\" in it... interesting, but I had no idea how to approach it (I looked like an idiot digging in my drink with chopsticks).

I ate at Bazaar and Jaleo multiple times and love it.. so I decided to stop by China Poblano for lunch today. I sat at the bar and my waitress was very friendly. I had the agua Fresca based on her recommendation and it was delicious. I also tried the Lemon Drop and it was very nice. I quickly ordered a Gazpacho and the quail... And it went downhill from there. Let me first say that the place was NOT busy at all...  It took at least 25 mn to get the gazpacho. My waitress apologized and I told her that it was not a big deal and things happen. Now, call me difficult but if the first course took much longer than expected, you would think that they would make sure that the next course doesnt? Wrong.. Bottom line is, I placed my order at 11:45am.. I received my second course at 12:25pm. During the whole time, no manager approached me nothing, I finally lost patience and asked one of the waitstaff to check on it. He did but came back behind the bar without saying a word to me... So I asked him again and without looking at me said \" it is going to be a few more minutes... \". I pointed out to him that the couple next to me came later , ate and was already gone. The brought me chips and salsa.  And the quail? Well, no one really checked on me to see if I was happy with it.. some of it was raw. For most part the dish was pretty boring. A piece of dragon fruit in the middle and 4 small pieces of fried quail. Big deal. Obviously I am upset. I think that they missed the mark as to how to handle guest complains. I quickly asked for the check, paid and left. Won't be back. I was planning on ordering more food but the attitude from the guy behind the bar really pissed me off so I went to Comme Ca on the third level and finished my lunch and it was great...",

The margaritas are made with \"salt air\" which is a salt foam instead of a salt rim which was really refreshing.  We had the made to order guacamole, shu mai, langosta tacos, walk on a cloud noodles.  All were fantastic.  The atmosphere was casual but hip and trendy.

Basically the portions were extremely small considering the prices you had to pay. The most disappointing dish we had was the Mongolian beef dish. We thought we were going to have a full meat dish. It ended up looking like a salad dish with more lettuce than meat in it, and the meat were in extremely small sizes. I also saw the face of our neighbor's when he got the same dish. He was shocked just as we were when he received the dish. I thought Chinese and Mexican food usually serve big portions. Not here. It's definitely not worth your money for a middle class family. I was still hungry after the meal. This is an embarrassment for such a beautiful hotel that just opened for a week...I felt kind of cheated eating here. Instead, I recommend to take your money to the Cosmo. buffet.",

This is the absolute worst eatery I set foot in, during 15  years of Vegas trips, and having been to most  Strip restaurants.  Decor is awful, a drunken child could have done better.

Service, I have not eaten at Denies in about 20 years, but I remember better service there. You wonder if the staff knows what a crappy place you are stepping into and feel nothing but contempt for your stupidity. Food - well, that is ultimately the True disappointment. Never mind the unusual selection which  seems to be either done for shock value or lack of inspiration, a least get the damned things to taste good. Lamb pot stickers, so overpowered with herbs and cumin, that the meat could have been rat and you would not know it (...on a second thought, maybe...nah, they wouldn't do that. Wood they?). Pork belly taco...wow, just a piece of fat smothered in sauce. Barbacoa and Carnitas were, at least eatable.  The hand made, fresh tortillas are good. So what you get is lousy crap wrapped in a good package, an you pay dearly. If this lousy, overpriced joint would be anywhere other than the Strip, it would be out of business in a month. No return visit for me and I'll make sure none of my Vegas visiting friends get scammed here.",

    "text": "Though Mexican-Chinese fusion food is not new (the same idea was done in the northern Mexican city of Monterrey, with its upscale \"Chino Latino\" restaurant), this restaurant can hold its own. The decor is modern, kitsch, and very inviting. Seating is limited at night, so make sure to make a reservation. The food here is actually not \"fusion\", per se, as asian-inspired and Mexican dishes are served on their own, and not \"mixed\". So, you can order pork dumplings and carnitas tacos separately. I believe this idea is lazy, but I would rather have well executed authentic food, rather than a failed attempt at some fusion. The Cochinita Pibil tacos are delicious, perfectly seasoned and very authentic. They taste very similar to what to would eat at the Yucatan peninsula. Of course, here they are way overpriced and served on a special taco gadget that keeps tacos standing up (to prevent spillage, I would assume). The Barbacoa tacos are also very authentic tasting, as well as the Pork Belly tacos. We also tried the 20-vegetable Fried Rice, as we'd previously seen someone on the Food Network claim it was the \"best thing they ever ate\" in Las Vegas. I would not go as far as saying it was the best thing here, but it is delicious. The \"Mexican mimosas\" are also very refreshing, though there is no such thing as a \"Mexican mimosa\"... The Margaritas, on the other hand, are modern and very tasty, as the salt element is done as a foam instead of only as a rim on the glass. Inventive and great. Do not order the Cajeta Flan, as it has NOTHING to do with a Mexican flan. I understand the chef was trying to add his own spin to this traditional dish, but I believe he should stick to what he knows best. It was nice, but it should not be named \"flan\", as it was more of a \"crema catalana\" (a typical dessert of the Catalunya region of Spain). The tortillas are hand-made, and you can reall taste the difference! I have to go back to try the Asian food. Overall, portions are tiny, so be prepared to order 4-5 per person. It is not cheap for the same reason. But, I will definitely come back.",

We also had a few of the dim sum dishes which wasn't great.  The shumai and har gau were kind of shameful - chalky, thin, small.  I thought this was going to be fusion cuisine but it was basically latin food on one side of the menu and chinese food on the other.  Where's the creativity in that besides the decor?  What's really disappointing is that Jose Andres' name is associated with this place - in reality, it's just an association; none of his ingenuity exists here.",

Now for service....never saw our waitress till aftet we recieved food. Then it was to drop off our drinks, yes I said drop off our drinks. Manager took our order after sitting for almost 15 minutes. I'm sure she heard us bitching. First coarse was just ok. Then some server dropped off a dish and didn't even look at us and left. It wasn't ours but no one came by so we ate it.....not good.....what do you want for free. By the way it was the 3rd time someone tried to give us food we didn't order. But that one topped it. Just mumbled, dropped it, and left before we could tell him it wasn't ours. It sat there and no one even came by so we tried it. Then came the 3rd coarse. No 2nd coarse. We had to ask the food runner for it. Oh did I happen to say we still haven't deen our waitress. Now she shows so we can order our dessert, nice enough but game over. The oddest thing is her name on her name tag wasn't Beatrice which was on the check. Will not be back....oh did I say I'm in the business and live in Vegas. But I will give a shout out to their other restaurant Jaleo. Probably some of the best good in Vegas, hands down If you go Laneice was my server and she was AWESOME! As for China Pablano waste of time.",

    "text": "As far as Chinese food goes, they're making an effort. There's the \"kitchen\" in front that you can watch through a window from outside as a few chefs who given their appearance are most likely direct Chinese imports, acquired to boost authenticity both visually and gustatorially. There is the real kitchen that you don't see though, and most likely all the food that isn't a steamed bun is created back there by who knows who.  Fitting the Cosmopolitan Hotel, the digs are stylish and interesting and modern. Service is excellent and the menu has great variety, but prices are steep. I was surprised to see that they had rou jia mou on the menu, being somewhat obscure here in the United States to the average person, but I didn't order it. My friend did, and my initial reservation about the price to size assessment were correct. A typical rou jia mou is something like sauced pork in a flatbread sandwich about five inches in diameter (to simplify the explanation). This one was sized accurately and slipped into a protective waxed paper pocket to keep fingers clean. $8.88 is much too steep for such a \"snack,\" even in the somewhat stylish surroundings. The meat in the rou jia mou had the same shortcomings that I've seen in other restaurants in the same dish and in beef rolls. The sauce is correct, but the meat is flavorless-if it is done properly, the sauce flavor permeates the meat instead of just covering it.  I had the dan dan mian, the noodles being very good, but the sauce had no kick, no spice. That seemed to be a re-occuring theme throughout our table's dishes- weak flavor.  I'm tempted to return simply because I hadn't explored the Mexican side of the menu, especially because that is one thing that this country does \"right\" more often, but my reservations continue to be about price. Perhaps if I'm in the casino again and flush with winnings, I'll return. Otherwise, there's much more culinary turf to explore in the city.",

So sitting down, they tell you they arent \"fusion\", probably do to all the reviews here, so great, we didnt want fusion anyways (cant a girl want an egg roll and cheese dip??) However place isnt Chinese nor Mexican!! To start, I just wanted a coke to drink. All they had was \"Mexican coke\" whats the difference other than regular coke is 2 bucks, nope this coke was 6 bucks!!! For a small little glass bottle. Just because it was imported from Mexico. So that got me off to a bad start.  The food was anything but tasty. We ordered the cheese dip. It came in a piping hot cast iron skillet, and it was just a block of cheap cheese. You know the kind you buy that refuses to melt. So you could even dip your bread in it without literally pulling the entire thing out! The other dishes we had were pretty tasteless too. We ended up going out for pizza after we spent our 80 bucks here (this place isn't cheap!). We were totally unsatisfied customers! Would not recommend this place at all.",

I ordered the 20 vegetable fried rice with chicken.  The vegetables must have been diced to a miniscule size, because I couldn't find all those vegetables  AND at $34 with tax and tip - not worth it.  The tacos are also so small- 2 bites.  Our friends ordered dessert and I laughed out loud when the waiter put it down.  It was a tablespoon sized portion.  The total bill came to about $400 and we were STILL hungry.  I've had amazing meals at commes ca and Milos both at the Cosmopolitan.  This restaurant was embarrassingly expensive and of inferior quality and can't even be discussed in the same breath.  Oh by the way everyone at our table had no problem spending a lot on a good mean, which we did the following night at Milos.  We just don't like being robbed for a shit meal.",

    "text": "Ate here this past Sunday night. The best I can categorize it was strange.  The atmosphere is very casual - felt more like a cafeteria than a fine dining experience. Long tables with backless chairs, Mexican pottery and artwork on the walls. No bar to wait for your table so we went to another restaurant's bar while we waited for the rest of our party to arrive. The menu is not Chinese-Mexican fusion it's basically half Chinese and half Mexican and all small servings (like tapas). Our group of 4 started with guacamole which was the most expensive item on the menu. It was truly delicious and was served with homemade tortillas which brought me back to Mexico in one bite.  We ordered chips and salsa as well which were very good. On the Chinese side we went with Traditional sui mai, Lamb pot stickers, And 2 noodle dishes. Everything was good but not outrageous. Plus I'm accustomed to dipping sauces with Sui Mai and pot stickers that are usually seasoned with garlic, ginger and a touch spicy. The sauces here seemed just to be soy sauce. We finished off with a few more Mexican choices - Shrimp mojo, scallop ceviche and barbeque beef tacos. All were very good but again not amazing. Also the offerings at the bar are very limited unless you're drinking tequila which I wasn't because I had to start drinking at the bar next door so I started with Sky raspberry vodka which I couldn't get at China Poblano. Plain vodka only here. Also only Chinese or Mexican beer. I probably wouldn't return unless I happened to be in the Cosmopolitan and was really hungry.",

The service from start to finish was great, our server had good suggestions and the manager stopping by a couple times was super friendly. The beef and lettuce entre was very good, tender and seasoned quite well I thought. Sui Mai was very good. A fun selection of tacos, carnitas, fish and lobster tacos were great and try the silencio, unique and delicious. The kumamoto oyster in a taco with lychee and beef tendon was an awesome concept! My only thing on it was too much of the beef tendon, maybe could be done a little differently but still liked. I'm a tequila lover and loved the tequila selection, great place to try some of the higher end tequilas with their flights. And a creative list of drinks and margaritas, they know how to make one. The golden pigs I believe they were called, fried pork buns -- Awesome. Almost like desert. We'll be back to try more from the menu for sure. Thank you!",

The Sprite I ordered was $5 and the Coke was $5.88...nowhere on the menu does it reveal these crazy prices!  But, back to the food...the vegetable fried rice had no taste whatsoever and the ocean's nest barely had any seafood in it...just a lot of large vegetables!  There are so many other great choices in Vegas and I am so disappointed we spent $80 here...ouch!",

I mean, The guac I make at my house is better than what I ate there. From there we also had the Sui Mai which was ok. It wasn't bad but it wasn't great either well, let me correct that.. the scallop Sui Mai was GREAT.... the traditional shrimp/pork.. well not so much!  We did try the twenty vegetable fried rice which was good. Probably the best thing on the table for me.  I also had the fish taco which was good.

In the early years, I would dream about when I could come back because I thought everything tasted so good.  The tuna ceviche with the amaranth is a literal wet dream for me.  I fantasize about it constantly.  Well, not anymore.  First, be warned to read the menu before you come.  It isn't really super True fusion.  It's more like Chinese and Mexican food on the same menu.  Some items are almost there in terms of fusion but not quite.  The food quality seems to have taken a dive.  Everything we got just wasn't as good as it should be.  This was the first time I've come for lunch so maybe it's that?  NO!  No excuse.  The food should be good no matter what time you go.  The tuna ceviche was drowning in sauce and waaaayyy too salty.  The 20 veggie fried rice tasted like nothing.  The tendon tacos were soggy.  Like the tendon and the tortilla were soggy.  How did this happen?  There isn't sauce.  Did you just give me old leftovers?  And the oyster did not taste fresh.  My mouth revolted it once I put it in there.    The service has always been slightly below average but it seriously was bad this last time.  Our server seemed a little pushy and rushed but we need time to look at the large menu.  We tell him that my mom can't have spicy things so he suggests the Beijing glass.  The menu has no mention of spice and of course when it comes there are peppers on it.  Luckily it doesn't come mixed so we took it off but dude, this is service 101.  By the end of the meal we didn't have the tacos.  We tell him this and he says, \"you didn't order tacos.\"  That's funny because I was trying to order the silencio ones but you were out so you told me to get the viva china ones.  Then he goes back to his notebook/order pad and sees we did order them so he comes back and says oops I'll put those in.  NO!!!  I don't want them anymore.  Well, he did anyway.  And he gave us the wrong amounts.  I didn't need 3 more tacos.  I just didn't.  Now I have to pay for these tacos I don't want.  I guess I could have made a bigger stink myself and forced him to take them off the bill but he should have offered.  This tells me this place is all about gouging their guests and not providing a great experience.    Sad.",

My friend and I split the tuna ceviche and green beans.  Both were truly amazing.  Food was served as it was made so it was super fast and hot.  We had a group of 5 ladies and the service was super accommodating and attentive.  No problems splitting the bills.  It was a wonderful dining experience. We will for sure be back again.",

When I booked the reservation for lunch, I remember thinking, \"This is going to be so freaking good\".  I LOVE Tacos!  So, the hostess found our reservation & seated us very promptly.  Server was at the table very quickly and was fairly attentive during our visit. (= Good)  What we ordered:  Cochinita Taco (= Good), Carnitas Taco (= Good), Pescado Estilo Baja Taco (= Good), Pollo a la Parilla Taco (= Good), Taco Nopales y Queso (= Good), Taco Frijoles (= Great), Special Of The Day Shrimp Taco (= Great) & Twenty Vegetable Fried Rice, for the little guy (= Great).  Can't forget the House Made Tortillas (= Great).  Out of 7 Tacos, we'd probably only order 2 or 3 of them again.  If we return, we'll order Dim sum, as we've heard good things about it.    Final Score = 0 Poor - 0 Average - 6 Good - 4 Great - 0 Awesome.  Which brings us to a 3.4 Star review.",

I really enjoyed the butter nut squash sopes also.  The waitress was very helpful with menu suggestions and asking about allergens. Thank you for having a gluten-free menu.

    "text": "China Poblano is one of my favorite casual restaurants on the Strip. One plus is that for smaller groups or going solo, you usually won't need to wait long if at all for a table - and can always eat at the bar too. They also have a window for takeout orders.  First off, must get this out of the way:  This is NOT a fusion restaurant - they have Chinese small bites / street food and Mexican small bites / street food, served independently. This is pretty clear even from the restaurant's website and I don't at all get why people expect differently and then rate this place poorly for it.  My go-to dishes are the tableside guac (strongly recommend tortillas), twenty vegetable fried rice, lamb pot stickers, and the silencio, cochinita, and lengua tacos. The chilaquiles, \"gan pung ji\" chicken, and dan dan mian are all solid dishes and worth ordering if you're a fan of them generally, but not particularly outstanding.  Based solely on the food, this place is a pretty easy 5* but the service is rough sometimes (the waiters/waitresses are all usually friendly enough, but are often inattentive / slow to get things done). Similarly, when the place is busy, the cooking stations can get really backed up and the dishes take forever to come out (on a recent trip, the wok station was backed up and several of our wok dishes like the fried rice took nearly an hour to be prepared).",

So when I had the chance to try one of Jose Andres' restaurants I jumped at it and China Poblano did not disappoint.  The decor was beautiful, the service was excellent. The place gives off the feeling of a nice restaurant but without being stuffy or making you feel like you should've dressed nicer.   The food was great and surprisingly affordable. Despite ordering two noodle dishes, a side of papas fritas and two margaritas, our bill was less than $40 INCLUDING TAX AND TIP.  Thats nutty prices for how good the food is.   I will say, however, that the food, while very, very good, was not amazing. If not for how crazy affordable it is, I might have given them three stars. If the food was a little better and still this cheap, it would have been five stars.",

A chef and hospitality group has to be very confident in the Chef's star power to pull off a fusion of two dissimilar cuisines, but China Poblano works because Chef Andres doesn't offer Mexican-Chinese fusion, instead, he merely offers Mexican and Chinese food on the same menu and under the same roof.  Both are done well - sometimes average, sometimes excellent - and overall the experience is satisfying.  Like all restaurants in Las Vegas, the cost-value ratio is skewed to high cost, even though the value isn't actually exceptional.  While the tacos are tasty, I've had better out of food trucks and paid half.  The twenty-vegetable fried rice is perhaps the tastiest expression of fried rice a diner might ever enjoy, but making it a meal requires adding shrimp and beef, meaning you'll pay about $40 for a bowl of friend rice!  Enjoy China Poblano; should you happen to be hungry when you go, bring your corporate expense account with you.",

Delicious, super-tender. Cochinita - overly salty, flavor was underwhelmingly one-dimensional, forgettable. Carnitas - great texture concept with pork rinds, but was dripping w/oil - hard to eat.  Chinese Dan Dan Mien - tasty even if not True to form - the hand-cut noodles are yum, spicy ground pork has a nice kick. Ocean Nest - essentially seafood liang mien huang (pan-fried Canto noodles). Nice seafood selection with lobster, scallops, king crab, shrimp. Was rather disappointed in presentation.  Physical restaurant layout is a bit awkward - no bar area, major minus. Limited ambiance limited, didn't care much for the awkward 'fusion' decor.",

    "text": "I've passed by this place quite a few times, but finally decided to dine in today. The service was very attentive, but I felt like they didn't go beyond what they teach you in table-waiting 101. Our server asked if we were ready for drinks, entrees, then desserts and let us know her personal favorites for each course, but didn't actually describe any of them. I honestly didn't have any problems with the service though, it's the food/prices that leave me less than satisfied.   Guacamole ($15): Although it was pretty pricey, it was probably my favorite dish of the night. There were a lot of large chunks of avocado, which is something I could never complain about and it was very fresh and flavorful. The only thing that I didn't like was that the waitress asked if we were done with it once the chips ran out, even though we still had about a third of it left. It was just kind of annoying that she was trying to take the plate away, rather than offering us more chips.  Large pot of Jasmine Downy Pearls ($8.88) - Very aromatic and tasty. I would probably come here just for the tea.    Chips and salsa ($4): I hardly touched the salsa, but I ate all the nice and crisp chips with the guacamole. Definitely worth the four bucks.  Pescado Frito ($6.50): Not very flavorful and not very \"fried.\" If I'm going to pay $6.50 for ONE taco, I expect it to be pretty damn good.   Dancing Eggplant ($9.88) - The waitress seemed a little reluctant when we ordered this. She made sure to warn us there were bonito flakes on it and the eggplant was boiled. I had the feeling she didn't like that at all. We thought it was just okay.  Traditional Sui Mai ($13.88): I really loved the crisp water chestnuts they added in the Sui Mai. The edible gold flakes on each piece also gave it a unique presentation.   Don't Be Jealous (Hot and Sour Soup) $8.88: This was the most disgusting Hot and Sour soup I have every had. It seriously ruined my palette. The whole bowl of soup just reeked and tasted like hot red wine. I have NEVER tasted Hot and Sour soup like that before. I couldn't take more than two bites of it without feeling sick because of the strong wine flavor it had. Don doesn't even like Hot and Sour soup, but he could still taste how much worse it was than others.   Rou Jia Mo Street Sandwich ($8.88): Way too salty and saucy. And for a whopping $8.88, this was definitely not worth it.   Jericalla ($11) - Have you ever had Abuelita Hot Chocolate? It comes in a package like this: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbeautifulspitup.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2011%2F12%2Fabuelita-mexican-hot-chocolate1.jpg&s=0c449d701932b5fb6f497ba0a9fefc4dfcef399bbb4756cbef1243800938dd1d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">beautifulspitup.com/wp-c...</a> containing tablets of compressed cocoa, sugar, and cinnamon: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbeautifulspitup.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2011%2F12%2Fcut-abuelita.jpg&s=7320482b4fa25656348b82f672a4a889a571b77ee362f3b3f3e406b536be63e8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">beautifulspitup.com/wp-c...</a>. Well, the small amount of custard on the bottom of the cup was covered in what seemed to be ground up tablets of Abuelita Hot Chocolate: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fs3-media2.ak.yelpcdn.com%2Fbphoto%2FV1zh1nc2VASkoNUsyJS5JA%2Fl.jpg&s=3631f196eaeb4fc4c7df1ae757e51b4c98aaf093cf9285becceb1bd13e0ce4ae\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">s3-media2.ak.yelpcdn.com...</a> and no, that was not a good thing. I felt like ai was just munching on hot chocolate powder. I mean, the custard and sorbet alone were good, but I couldn't eat those without eating all the powder. Plain and simple, it sucked.   Overall, I loved the presentation of all the dishes, however the flavors just didn't match. The Hot and Sour soup really killed it for me. The only thing I think was worth coming here for was probably the tea, but that's still not something I would drive over here for.  Warning: If you look at your bank statement a day or two after coming here and the amount charged is a lot higher than what you actually paid, it's because they like to \"pre-authorize\" themselves for a 30% tip, but it goes down to whatever you actually paid them when the transaction clears. Why anyone would give this place a 30% tip is beyond me...",

    "text": "When I first saw China Poblano, I thought it was just some gussied up Chinese joint at the Cosmopolitan.  When I looked a little closer, I realized it was some kind of combo Mexican-Chinese restaurant.  When I checked them out on my phone, I learned they were a Jose Andres creation.  When my friends suggested them for lunch, I was game.  When we were done, I was sorely unimpressed.  Now, it's probably my fault for assuming, but looking at the place, I was under the impression that China Poblano offered a fusion of Chinese and Mexican food.  In reality, they mostly offer Chinese AND Mexican food.  As in, one and the other.  Not as in, a melding of two very different cuisines.  Disappointing enough already, but that also meant having to get two things in order to try both sides of the menu.  After asking the waiter for suggestions, I took his advice and ordered a couple of tacos to go with my noodle dish (he warned that the portions were \"small-ish\"):  - Dan Dan Mian (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog?select=1znpnNpUi4mUde6NTXRxEA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/GJ_b...</a>) - underwhelming.  The noodles themselves were okay and I liked how the pork sauce was actually spicy, but the dish seemed salty.  Really, the only flavors I could really get out of it was spiciness and saltiness.  I didn't expect much and they still fell short. - Carnitas Taco (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog?select=BqnTT9gfKS5Ol5gszHWr2A\">yelp.com/biz_photos/GJ_b...</a>) - FAIL.  Unlike my noodle dish, I actually had hopes for this one.  Rather than crispy, grilled meat, I was greeted with a mound of shredded pork dripping with oil (check out the ends of the wrapper) and a topping of deep fried fat (think pork rinds but worse).  No bueno. - Pescado Frito (fried fish) Taco (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog?select=ilJU8hdfD1EXVL_EZKfFeA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/GJ_b...</a>) - by default, it was the best thing I had.  On its own, it was only decent.  The fish and pickled onions worked, but I thought the flavor was too muted.  If it was a little stronger, I would have liked it more.  Given the celebrity chef owner and China Poblano's location on the Strip, the meal wasn't cheap.  To charge $5.50 for that carnitas taco (and to a lesser extent, $6.50 for that pescado taco) is practically criminal though.  With just the $12 I spent on the tacos, I can find a better Chinese noodle dish and tacos, and still have change to tip.  Unless you're a big Jose Andres fan, you're better off going elsewhere (like Holstein's next door).",

With the prices they had, I thought I'd be in for some amazing fusion cuisine...  Queso Fundido - $10 literally just melted, buttery cheese. I can't believe we paid 10 bucks for this! Papas Fritas w/ Mole - $7 Was interesting at first, but then no one wanted to finish it. Setas (Wild Mushroom Guacamole Tacos) - $4.50/taco I got two. I didn't even want to finish my 2nd one, so I gave it to my boyfriend. Cochinita (Yucatan-style BBQ Pork Tacos) - $5.50/taco My friends said it was okay. Nothing special.  We didn't feel satisfied after our meal. Small portions. Super overpriced. Lousy flavors. AVOID!",

The hostess kindly seated us immediately. The menu has a variety of items. We ordered fried wontons, queso fundido, and chicken ji song (lettuce wraps). The chicken ji song was my favorite dish. China Poblano lettuce wraps was fresh and the ingredients blended well together. The fried wontons and queso fundido was average at best in my opinion. I chose mango sticky rice for dessert. China Poblano sticky rice was innovative compared to other restaurants I've visited. The unique spin on the mango sticky rice was cool literally (served cold). I enjoyed every bite of my mango sticky rice. The sticky rice is perfect for a hot Las Vegas day. Our server wasn't very attentive (restaurant was not busy). We had to flag her down for refills constantly. The ambience at China Poblano is awesome. It's a good place for drinks and enjoying the Cosmopolitan eye candy. I personally expected more from some of the dishes but they didn't hit the spot for me. The presentation of meals deserves two thumbs up! I give China Poblano a 2.5 rating.",

    "text": "Pleasantly bizarre. I guess that's how I would sum this place up.  Watch the video on their website if you want to get a feel for the vibe of the restaurant.  If you are looking for a more classy, quiet, date-night kind of place you are better off going to one of the eateries on the third floor.  This place was rocking on the Saturday night we were there, electrified by the massive crowd just outside the door waiting to get into the club.  But I was in a good mood and enjoyed the music and people watching while we waited for our table perched high above everyone else on what appeared to be a mod style version of a Mayan pyramid... except that there were golden Buddha statues on top.  Yeah.  So now you are starting to get it when I say this place is weird but cool? Did I mention that there was a digital painting on the wall that alternated between a portrait of Frida Khalo and the Dalai Lama? And a sculpture roughly in the shape of a human head protruding from the back wall onto which they projected digital images of Kim Jong-il?  OK, so you got it now, right?  I agree with the other reviewers that I wish they had more fusion dishes.  I was disappointed that the majority of the menu items were either Chinese or Mexican but not both.  And most of the food was just average.  Good but not great.  And yes, ridulously over priced. But at a hip restaurant in what is arguably the hottest casino hotel on the strip right now, that is to be expected. So now, for those of you still reading this, here is a rundown of what we ordered.  Guacamole - My husband made the comment that this was not even the best guac that he had eaten that day.  I am not a big fan of the stuff in general but I would have like to see some kind of twist to make something that is so easy to make at home worth ordering here.  Maybe a little five spice powder or some ginger for that Asian influence.  Are you listening Jose Andres? And you really need to serve it with chips.  Those tortillas were pretty darn good but it is a texture thing.  Pot stickers - Beautiful presentation.  Really, just gorgeous. I even took a picture.  I truly enjoyed the flavors and it was a cool twist to get lamb instead of the traditional pork.  But where was the sauce? Everyone knows the best part about eating pot stickers is the sauce. That was another little thing that just made the dish seem lacking and also a missed opportunity to bring in a fusion experience (How about a little chimichurri or mole sauce for dipping? Hello?)  Coctel de Camarones - I was so disappointed in this dish, I can't even tell you.  For those of you who have ever had True cocteles at an authentic Mexican seafood place just don't bother.  If you are the type that enjoys salsa out of a jar, then you might like it.  Once again, though, they were missing the accompaniment. Traditionally, this dish is either served with saltine crackers or tostada shells. However, when we asked our waitress if we could get some chips or something to eat it with she said we were supposed to eat it with the spoon, like gazpacho. wtf?  Chilaquiles - This dish was not authentically Mexican either but I really enjoyed it.  My husband, who had apparently ordered it without reading the description, did not. He was expecting red sauce instead of green but I loved the tangy tomatillo salsa and the cheese was delish. But I agreed with him that there really should have been meat or eggs on there. And the chips were not really cooked into the dish, it was more like nachos than anything else.  Mole tacos - We both liked these though they were a little bland.  I guess not everyone likes spicy but I was expecting at least a little heat.  Gourmet tacos like these are pretty common where we live so I wasn't surprised by the price or size but meh, I've had better.  Palmitos - This salad saved the day for me.  It was truly special.  I love hearts of palm but these weren't the limp white tubes you get out of a jar.  Crisp and fresh, mixed with other equally fresh julienned vegetables, it was a hearty and satisfying salad.  But the dressing is what really blew my mind.  Sweet and sour with a strong tamarind flavor.  It tasted like those Mexican tamarindo candies... except more crisp and organic.  The whole dish was just so clean and brisk.  I know not everyone's palate is the same and someone else might find it too strong, there was a lot of fresh lime juice in there and definitely some kind of chile.  But that is perfect for me. I may return to this place just for that salad... or if I in the mood for some ethnic Vegas style kitsch.",

They had a killer tuna tartare type dish, some pretty good stir fried noodles, and some great guac (although IMO they added a bit to much sriracha or some other Asian chile type sauce to try and make it taste different than regular guac).  Pork buns were decent but a little doughy for my taste.  Really good margs with whipped salt.  Docking a star because the raw oyster served on top of the wagyu beef taco was nearly inedible---super fishy.",

I didn't even say anything because it should be obvious to not let that happen. The food was just ok and I wouldn't recommend that you make this a stop.",

I entertained a few clients the other evening and my service was the worst I have ever encountered at a restaurant . However, my brother was entertaining a client during the exact same time in a different area of the restaurant and he said his service was perfect so I guess it is hit or miss.  I will question the management because when you are in Las Vegas and go out to eat and 3 of the items we ordered were all out and it was only 7pm . Bad bad bad bad management .  The tacos were very good . Salencia and chicken tacos were wonderful . Guacamole, both spicy and regular were very good also. Didn't care for the salsa at all . Tasted like a bad attempt at a smoky bbq sauce .   My service was so off the wall. We ordered an appetizer but that was the very last thing we received . Shouldn't that be the first thing you receive with a meal? Our meals came in bits and pieces . I would receive one taco and then 10 minutes later I received my other taco. This was the same for every guest in my party . One gentlemen in my party received his entree first and then 20 min later received his salad . Just seems all backwards . We had to remind the waitress at the end that we ordered salsa and she finally brought it . I wish we had just forgot because I didn't care for it .   Overall, the food is pretty good. The service is quite lacking . Maybe management just needs to focus on training them and ordering enough food to accommodate your customers ?",

Their salt air margaritas are absolutely to die for, and my friend has been re-creating them perfectly for at least a year. It takes some work to make the \"air,\" but it's totally worth it! One of my favorite drinks anywhere.  The concept of Mexican-Asian fusion seemed a little bizarre to me at first, but there is plenty of separation on the menu if you are not an adventurous eaters. It's fun to mix and match Mexican and Asian small plates and go between.  I have been here 3 or 4 times, and have tried a variety of dishes. Almost every dish is a small plate or appetizer, and my friends and I always get a variety of options to share. The guacamole is outstanding, and there are plenty of gluten free options (including the chips), which pleased my gluten free friends. When Pigs Fly is one of my favorite appetizers. The steamed buns are super filling, but delicious.  I would recommend trying at least one of the sui mai options, and if you are indecisive, try the combination! The Dan Dan Mian noodles are delicious, but definitely on the heavy side. The twenty-vegetable fried rice is also a go-to, especially if you are feeling the need to eat more vegetables during your time in Vegas!  This is a perfect spot to try with friends and explore different menu items, including the must-have salt air margaritas.",

The outside looked fun and interesting which brought me in, but now thinking about it, no place that offers two different cuisines could possibly be good at anything, lesson learned. Maybe we ordered the wrong things? But they failed on both meal and app for us. We ordered the queso fundido for an app, it was a skillet filled with congealed cheese meant for dipping tortillas with, it was just a big glob of greasy cheese, you couldn't even dip anything in it, but pick the entire glob up with a spoon, disgusting.  Then my husband ordered the brisket tacos, in which he stated the entire meal tasted like flavorless cardboard. I ordered some noodle dish that apparently was popular per the waitress, but it was not tasty at all. The noodles were big and gummy and the sauce was so incredibly thick, like a paste, and so salty, I could barely eat two bites of it without wanting to vomit. I have nothing bad to say about the service we received.  The waitress was kind and did comp our appetizer. But we ultimately left with empty stomachs having paid full two meals just to go next door at Holsteins buns and shakes to satisfy our bellies and make up for such an awful experience.",

    "text": "yes yes and yes. I have been CRAVING this place since eating here with my bf. It is astonishing to me that there are only 3 stars on the company profile. Jose Andres can do NO WRONG in my book. Started our meals out with a few yummy cocktails. I got the Margarita with a \"salt air topping\" wow. I could have had 4 of these, but decided I actually wanted to remember my meal so i refrained. Its your typical Margarita with tequila and fresh lime juice and agave, but topped with a salt foam. Great presentation I may add. We had no clue what to order so we ordered a few items to share. We had a friend join us so between 3 people, this is what we had Ensalada Gaspacho Estilo De Morelia; an amazing salad consisting of pineapple, dragonfruit, mango, jicama, queso fresco, and a  chile pequin  Tuna Ceviche minus the pecans  Cctel De Camarones; =shrimp, jumbo lump crab meat, tomato, and diced avocado  Shrimp Mojo shrimp in a sweet black garlic sauce with roasted poblano peppers   ....and the best thing ive ever eaten  20 vegetable with friend rice. OMG. this is a vegan dream with so many different veggies all grilled served over rice that seriously melted in my mouth. I cant wait to go back to this restaurant and have 2 orders of this...  This restaurant has a very interesting concept. Asian Fusion meets Mexican. I really enjoyed these two combined. The service was impeccable, I wish I could remember my servers name but he was so awesome. With so many restaurants in the Cosmo to choose from, I highly recommend trying this place.",

    "text": "I absolutely LOVE the concept at China Poblano -- Chinese and Mexican food served side by side, with no fusion -- but I was also apprehensive about the middling reviews.  I'm glad I swept my apprehension under the rug because my lunch here was wonderful!  Located on the second floor of the Cosmopolitan Hotel, China Poblano is bright and inviting, with lots of color and neon and bold decorative touches.  (I dig the giant walk-through Buddha in lieu of a door.)  It's one of Chef Jose Andres' casual joints, in contrast to the fancier Jaleo and e upstairs.  The place fills up fast at lunchtime, but I was lucky enough to score a seat at the bar without waiting at around 11:30am on a Saturday.  The menu is divided into Chinese and Mexican small plates.  Everything is served tapas-style.  Nothing is particularly authentic, but what do you expect in a Las Vegas hotel-casino?  I started with one of the specials of the day -- elote and squash blossoms.  Loved the flavors and textures, especially the crunchy bits of elote sprinkled throughout.  Everything was very fresh, light, and enjoyable.  Next, I had the dan dan mian (wheat noodles with spicy pork sauce and peanuts).  This was a good complement to the elote, because its profile of flavors and textures was the diametric opposite.  The noodles were rich and heavy -- probably too heavy for most people.  The spicy pork sauce was almost like thick clay in consistency.  I didn't mind, but I'm also not sure if that was intentional or not.  I washed my lunch down with China Poblano's specialty beverage of the house -- the salt air margarita (spiked with pomegranate).  This was a unique take on a classic cocktail, with a salty foam on top in lieu of the traditional salt rim.  Very refreshing.  Bar service is very upbeat and friendly -- and so are the other patrons!  Everyone eating here seems to be coming or going in an alcohol-induced haze, so expect revelry.  Prices are definitely high.  I'm still smarting over that $14 margarita.    That said, I'd go back.  The menu is just too tempting to resist!",

    "text": "One star is one stars too many, which is a bummer considering how excited I was for their menu selections -- Spanish and Hong Kong style dishes are two of my favorite profiles. Needless to say, I am more than willing to spend $30 on a plate of noodles when the chef is renowned and the menu is enticing. \"Never judge a book by its cover\" has never rang so True. While the food was ok, it wasn't worth the service, money or time wasted. I literally regret not going to the burger place next door. (Ew.) The pork buns were the best out of the 3 dishes we ordered (Hong Kong style soup and BBQ Pork noodles).   Here'e the thing. If my review was based solely on the food, maybe I would have given 2-3 stars for presentation and taste (come on, heat the damn noodles up.) But based on the service, staff and overall experience I had -- I would give negative stars. Never, in my life have I been treated so poorly by a restaurant. Let's start with the hostesses who took one look at us and decided to make us sit out on the patio instead of inside. OK, fine, we just came from the pool and although we were completely covered, I can understand. She then told us it would be \"a while\" to get service. Except there was nobody there, so why would it take a while? I went ahead and asked her for water instead of waiting. Waiting for menus and water in 100+ degree weather is unacceptable, especially in an empty restaurant. My friend has food sensitivities and wasn't able to choose anything off the menu, she went next door to get food which she was able to eat - told the hostess she would be back. She comes back and the hostess BLOCKS her physically from coming in and says \"you can't come in here.\"   My friend, whose bachelorette party it was over the weekend was intoxicated, alone and turned away without any reasoning or exception. I don't care what your 'rule' is, if a young female, alone and intoxicated is turned away from being with her group because of a hostess on a power trip, the ethic and moral compass of the company which employs her is seriously in question. We don't live in a world (ESPECIALLY in Vegas) where that should be tolerated. I asked for the manager, which again, I was told would take a while. When he finally comes over and apologizes but tells me she can't come eat with someone else's food, I said she wasn't even eating, just waiting to come back and sit with us until we were done and could leave. But did we have a chance to explain? Nope. He then tells me that if I would have came and gotten him earlier he could have made an exception -- but it took 10 minutes for him to get off his ass and see where the customer complain was happening?? RIGHT. Then apologizes, brings me my bill and leaves. Yes, I am infuriated at this point and seriously considering not paying my bill. (I paid, out of sheer respect for the industry and personal ethos.) I however, did not tip.   Here's the best part: A waiter, who was not our waiter came to pick up the check, noticed that I didn't leave a tip and asked what my problem was. I kindly told him that I didn't have a good experience and that it wasn't personal, it was my experience. He slammed the check on the table, crossed his arms and got very close to me and said that \"he shouldn't be treated like this because of my experience.\" He proceeded to get in my face and I got up and left. The hostess condescendingly said \"bye.\" WOW. For a city that thrives on hospitality it sure seems that they would put more effort into customer service.   My company travels to Las Vegas anywhere from 5 -10 times per year for week long trips and we base our food & beverage allotment, hotel reservations and accommodations off of past and present experiences -- I can tell you now that our annual budget will NEVER be put towards this restaurant or The Cosmopolitan hotel ever again. No person should ever feel that they are not worthy of customer service. Best of luck to the chef, the concept is promising but with a staff like this you won't last. Go check out any of Gordon Ramsay's restaurants, you will then know what it takes to get positive retention.",

We ordered lotus root chips *twice* - loved it!  20 vegetables fried rice which is their signature dish and they offered to make it without eggs & oyster sauce Col de Bruselas - caramelized brussel sprouts Guacamole with fresh tortillas We even ordered the Papas Fritas which we weren't a fan of and they promptly took it back without any questions and even offered to get something else.  The food in general was pretty good but slightly over salted for our taste.   We were a bit skeptical to try this out considering some reviews but our experience was good! Will definitely return.

Back to this review, it's finals week, Im procrastinating and I wonder to myself. LA Food and Prices spoils me. San Diego forces me into this misconception of what prices should be as everything is 1-3 more dollars expensive in San Diego than it is in L.A while quality is just the same if not worse. Now you're thinking 1-3 dollars isnt that much but when you add in another 1-2 dollars in tips. that's 5 dollars more per meal.  As a starving college student on a low calorie diet ( trust me i'm down 60 lbs) I probably shouldn't be eating out so I shouldn't complain. But even the poorest college student has to have their starbucks every morning.   Now on to the story, being that it's in Vegas, I was pretty much drunk the whole time, from Thursday night until Saturday, completely drunk ALL day. I ended up needing nail polish. oh lord.   Being as how I was drunk the whole time I forgot to eat. Being hungry I looked around for food and saw a pizza place, I should have went there cause it was a lot better than China Poblano. But at the time I saw, \"Oh wow Chinese food and Mexican food? this is interesting let's check this place out\"   The first thing you notice about the place is very fancy cause it Vegas, but your jaws gape and your eyes bulge when you see the prices. The prices here ranges a fancy restaurant but the food is no where near fancy.   Now when I was in line it looked at the taco they had here were actually pretty fresh as I saw them make it from scratch, however, it seems like the Chinese food here comes from some back room in the back where you do not see how they attempt to make your food.   Back to this review. I order Swallow A Cloud which already has the imagery of swallowing some strange white liquid as the liquid itself was actually brown, but I should have been weary when they give Chinese Won Ton the name of \"Swallow A Cloud\" I did absolutely no swallowing as I threw away most of the Won Ton that I ordered. But seriously, who came up with these names.  Now you're trying to swallow misty white cloud, sounds sketch right? well you shouldn't even attempt because it was absolutely horrible.   The description state that is \"fresh\"white noodle and wonton but it tasted no where near \"fresh\" as it was absolutely horrible. You get 3 small pieces of wonton, half a handful of crappy package noodles, and a unflavorful broth for 20 bucks. At the time I was thinking, 20 bucks, it CAN't be that bad. I should have went to wicked spoon or panda express.   i have absolutely no idea how this place gets 3\\5 stars  I'd probably have more luck finding \"chinese\" food across the street at Panda Express. What a sad statement right?",

    "text": "Booooooooo! Thumbs Down!  To be exact on my rating, it is a 1.5 stars. I reward 1 star for the decor (and because we have to) and another .5 stars for effort, and then rounded up to get a measly 2 stars.  Our order was the Phoenix Chicken or something like that, Guacamole, and the 20 vegetable fried rice. All dishes were not up to par in terms of taste. The chicken and the fried rice were recommendations from our server.  The fried rice was bland and it was maybe the equivalent of 3 bowls of rice at a chinese restaurant. This is not a lot of fried rice for about 20 dollars.   The chicken was actually a cornish hen I believe. It tasted okay, but I would have preferred a chicken from el pollo loco, to be honest. That dish was also in the neighborhood of 20 dollars or more, and if you know how small cornish hens are, you might agree that 20 something dollars for that amount of hen is stupid.   The guacamole was a whopping 15 dollars. This was honestly the only thing we ordered that I enjoyed, but it wasn't worth 15 dollars.  The service was pretty good until our server asked if the fried rice she recommended was good, and I replied, \"It's okay.\" She then asked, just okay? And I confirmed, \" Just okay.\" Then she quickly got our bill without saying another word, or even a thank you or anything, just dropped the bill. When we paid, it was another silent transaction void of any actual speaking on her part.  Water doesn't come with ice. The decor in the place was interesting, but I would never come here again.  To sum it all up, the portions were small, the price tag was high, especially for substandard -tasting food. We came here because we wanted to give it a shot. My rating isn't solely based on portion size, because I would honestly prefer fried rice from Panda Express and El Pollo Loco if portion size was the same and prices were the same. Please don't waste your money at this restaurant.",

    "text": "Yesterday was actually \"Take Two\" for us here, since we planned on meeting a friend for dinner.  He got called in to work and couldn't make it, but it wasn't necessarily a \"tragic evening\", because the food here is pretty amazing.  A quirky but compelling mix of Chinese and Mexican cuisine (but NOT ON THE SAME PLATE, thank GAWD!), you're free to mix-and-match however you please, just like the decor, which I can only describe as \"Big Trouble In Little Chinese Tijuana.\"  We started off with chips and salsa. I am a sucker for fresh, warm chips and these pretty much RULED.  Most with a palate for something a little kickier will find the salsa wanting, but having been burned by too many MUY CALIENTE sauces in the past, I found this one just right.  Bear kicked it off with one of the tacos as well - I don't remember which, but the blissful look on his face was recommendation enough for me.  I decided to mix it up with two tacos: the chicken and mole poblano and the BBQ pork with marinated onions, along with \"When Pigs Fly\": four delicately steamed buns filled with more BBQ pork.  Bear had the \"Special 8\" Dim Sum - (probably not getting the name right, but I won't forget that taste!) - delicate, tasty jewels of meat, spices and veggies swathed in very light wrappers. I had bites of the chicken and pork...which I will have to definitely try in the future!  It was all A-MAZING. Paired with rum-and-Cokes for me (Negra Modelos for Bear), the tastes of each item are light and exquisite - tender meats, flavorful but not overpowering sauces, but don't sit brick-like in your stomach as most chain-restaurant style Chinese and/or Mexican foods have a tendency to do.    Because I'd really had a taste for some pho noodles all week (nursing a pretty wicked cold earlier), I knew I wouldn't get them here, but when I saw \"Dan-Dan Mian\" noodles on the menu, I knew I wasn't leaving until I had some, which I ordered in lieu of dessert.  I love good \"Dan-Dan\" as much as the next Chinese food enthusiast, but THESE? Not saying it wasn't a healthy sized portion, but these bad boys made me wish for a kiddie-pool sized bowl that I could jump into and do the backstroke in. Oh, yeah.  They are THAT. FREAKIN'. GOOD.  Bear had a dessert I did have a bite of - mangos with a light creamy sauce and maybe pine nuts? - that I made a mental note to have next time we visit.  To sum it up - awesome food, great service from everyone, but most especially from our bartender/server Casey. However, I only have one 'caveat' to present.  When the bill arrived, it did give me one of those \"RUH-ROH, RAGGY!\" moments when I saw the total.  Not saying you have to be Mark Cuban or Steve Wynn to eat here, but if you have a more-than-healthy appetite - and we do, you may want to put China on your \"Special Occasions Only\" list.  It's just that all that wonderful food DOES add up (all tacos, dim sum and other items are priced separately), so you may want to have a \"point guard\" with you to keep an eye on the rising tab.   Other than that, I would dare say that we'll be back!",

    "text": "So a while back when I was in Vegas me and my friend decided to try to find the food court at the Cosmopolitan cause we were hungry and had some time to kill before our flight.  We looked around on the second and floor and ended up walking into a restaurant that had Mexican food on one side and Chinese Dim Sim on the other.  So we thought hey, here's the food court! Let's go grab a seat. We get seated by a host and thought it was weird that a food court had a host..then we get handed a menu, only then did we realize that this place wasn't a food court, it was a full on restaurant!  At that point I think we both debated if we should leave, but in the end we decided to stay and give it a shot.  I have to admit once you sit down and look at the place and you see the Dim Sum station vs the Mexican grill, its very foolish that we couldn't figure out that this place was something different; and it sure was.  The Mexican-Chinese fusion food they have here is something I have never experienced in my whole life.  And that's actually pretty surprising considering I grew up in San Jose, CA where there is an abundance of Chinese Restaurants surrounded by Mexican Restaurants in the Eastern Part of the city.  Well we get cracking and I remember I had a few orders of dim sum and a few tacos.  I had no idea that gourmet dim sum and tacos could exist..let alone exist in the same restaurant!  The fusion food will keep you coming back for more, I know that from now every time I'll go to Vegas (which seemingly appears to be every 6 months) I'll be making a stop at this tasty little restaurant!  And you should too! Just make sure that you know that this place isn't a food court. haha.",

Unless you LOVE vinager, DO NOT order the Huitlacoche Noodles!

She told the waiter that she did not enjoy it and that we all tasted it and felt the same and the waiter told the manger who came by our table. The manager asked my friend, did you mix it?  and she said yes and he said something a long the lines of if you didn't know how to eat it, why did you order it and said there was nothing he could do.... really?!?!?!?!? we were a party of like 16 spending A LOT of money at your restaurant and he said he couldnt do anything for us???? wow....   2 stars for convenience being right across from where we had to be/getting reservations for a large party 2 hours before showing up.... and 1 star for the Viva China... but I'd rather give 0 stars for the horrible customer service.",

I perused the menu online and saw that they do take out which was awesome!!  I placed my order, I decided on the tacos de lengua, cooked in pasillas and a Saison DuPont (beer).   China Poblano is in the Cosmopolitan, a beautiful hotel and casino that is across from Planet Hollywood.  The restaurant is brightly colored, reds that invoke both asian and mexican influences.    The take out window is a nice touch and my food was ready!  The smells from the kitchen were enticing but I was surprised to not see the restaurant portion not completely packed.    The tacos were good, the meat was tender and cooked they my mom used to cook it!  The tortillas were nice I wish they put two, because they put so much meat into the tacos, a second one would've have helped!  I liked them, I wished it had more pasillas but it was good.  Jose Andres' Jaleo is wonderful, all of his tapas have wonderful flavor.  I was hoping the tacos would too, maybe if I went with the pork or lobster ones.  I like China Poblano, next I will make a reservation and order an entree.  The selection of beers are great!  The Saison I had was delish and refreshing.  @JoseAndres you are a great chef and I love ThinkFood Group!",

AMBIANCE:   It has pretty cool eclectic decor. Homey type feel. Good for groups.  CUSTOMER SERVICE:   Our server was really nice. No complaints there. Mainly, my 3 stars are for the fact that it's just kind of a rip off. I get that it's at the Cosmo, but I just wouldn't really go back because there are just so many other options for more decent prices.",

    "text": "We had a party to attend at nine (in our hotel room) and we showed up at China Poblano at eight-something, I want to say a little more into something than is smart when you need to be somewhere else on time. (We were the hosts. It was kinda tacky to be late.)  Everyone in our party was drinking and laughing and not paying attention like the fools that we are.  We asked our waiter if it would be possible to order and be out in time to make our party by nine. We fully expected it was not possible. Because come on! We didn't even know what we wanted yet!  BUT IT WAS!!!!  Our waiter was so efficient. He recommended dishes (that were all THE BOMB by the way. So delicious! Ants climbing up a tree: order it!). He expedited our dinner so quickly that we actually made it out a few minutes before nine fat and happy. Unbelievable service. And then when I expressed our appreciation, our waiter was sincerely humble about it. I was floored. He was one of those guys who truly enjoys service to others. I cannot praise him enough. I think the best waiters are drawn to the best restaurants and even though China Poblano was \"cheap and quick\" they are one of the best in my book. What a classy guy.  We went back the next day for lunch, obviously.",

    "text": "I discovered this restaurant after viewing a recommendation by Anthony Bourdain, so while a friend was in town we decided to come check it out. It's located inside the Cosmopolitan Hotel which is one of my favorite places on the strip. Upon arrival we were greeted by a friendly hostess and offered our choice of the bar (which allows you to watch them work on tortillas from the open kitchen) or a table.  I felt for Vegas fine dining this place was pretty affordable. Miller D was our server he was quick to greet us with a smile and I believe could tell we were unclear on if we should try a drink. He recommended the Sueno Cocktail which comes with a spicy salt rim. He was kind enough to do Half/Half in case we were a fan of the spicy kick it offered. Both my friend and I really enjoyed the drink.  The main thing I was dying to try was this taco that I read about called The Viva China Taco , but we also ordered a Happy Family Jiaozi  (delicious pot stickers with amazing flavoring)and Golden Pigs ( Fried Pork Buns) and some Beijing Glass noodles(cold noodle dish with avocado and jicama for an interesting twist). Overall I LOVED EVERYTHING except that Taco I wanted so badly to try. When it first arrived I took a bite of the Beef Tendon alone and it was delicious but when taking a bite of the taco all together with the oyster on top I felt like the ocean had thrown up in my mouth. It just wasn't a good combo for my pallet. Maybe I got a bad oyster I don't know but overall it was an experience I will not quickly forget.  Everyone at the restaurant was super friendly and our drinks were always full. The only reason I have to deduct a star is I somehow was overcharged $20 on my bill. Thankfully my friend encouraged me to keep my receipt and I am dealing with that situation but I definitely feel like this place is worth checking out! I left feeling satisfied and excited to go back to try some more cool fusions.",

    "text": "This is by far one of the worst restaurants we have been in a while.  First, the concept.  This is not a fusion restaurant, but a restaurant that has some Mexican dishes and some Chinese dishes.  Neither one crosses the border to the other and they do not really match either.  Second, we waited a very long time to sit down even though there were empty tables and they were actually empty for over 1 1/2 hours before anybody used those tables.  Even if they were reserved, they were empty for at least 2 hours.  This is not a very big restaurant, so having 2-3 tables that were not occupied for that long span of time is a big issue.    When we finally sat down the very unimpressive menu became even smaller.  When we started ordering we were told they were out of at least 3 things on the menu.  I can only eat chicken since unfortunately I have allergies to some of the other proteins, being out of 2 of only 4 chicken items on that menu was a big issue.  When we finally order, and not until after we ordered, we were told that the food comes from 4 different kitchens and it does not necessarily come out at the same time.  3 of the people in our party were completely done before the 4th person had received his meal.    We ordered the roasted chicken taco(Pollo a la parilla taco) , the duck tongue taco(Silencio), the Caldo Tlalpeno , Tamal Rojo, The Chinese Pork Buns(when Pigs Fly) and the Mongolian Beef Lettuce.  Surprisingly enough the one that took the longest seemed the easiest and fastest  to cook.  The Mongolian Beef Lettuce(which is nothing more than grilled pieces of beef and a lettuce salad drenched in what I assume was a soy sauce vinaigrette (it only tasted like sauce) took the longest.  By the time it reached the table the meat was not even hot.    We did not try dessert since we had already had miserable service and even worse food.  It is not a place where I would go back at all.    Perhaps we were there on a bad night, but to us the menu does not really make sense together and given the fact that they were out of so many items at 8 pm, was very disappointing.",

I tried the fried dumpling which was alright. It was fried like a crab Rangoon, with thick dumpling skin. The swallow a cloud noodle is just Hong Kong style wonton noodle soup. It has egg noodles, bok choy and wontons. The noodles were fine but no taste, the broth was bland, the wontons were mediocre. When pigs fly is a braised pork stuff steamed bun. The filling is sweet but decent. The rou jia mo sandwich is a more traditional dish that I was looking forward to. It's also a braised pork filling in a toasted bun shell but I was Sadly disappointed. The filling was so salty that it didn't even taste good. Not what I was expecting.",

    "text": "Great little place that you totally don't see coming! Chinese and Mexican? Uh. ..ok. That was my initial secondary thought. My initial primary thought was \"Hungry we are. Prepare for intake of nutrients\" (I talk like Yoda when I'm starving. I quite possibly could eat poop and not know when I'm at this level). However, this place is faaar and away from feces. Which according to the 3 star over all rating, you wouldn't guess to be the case. I'm happy to shut down the nay sayers and conclude that this place wins like Serena Williams. It was a grand slam baby. For a tapas spot, the portions were large!    Everything was delicious, my favorite being the lamb pot stickers and the shrimp mojo. Awesome. I'm unsure why people are hating on this spot. Maybe the mix (mix, not fusion) of Chinese and Mexican are just to far out for some people and they are expecting dirt cheap, greasy, day old left overs tasting college dorm vittles; sorry amoeba brained douche bags... this place has class in their cuisine. #happynoshing",

Sadly I only give this a 3 star because we never received our noodle dish that we ordered and the server told us it was cooking, but we waited  30-40 mins before we even asked and then waited another 10-15 after we we're told they were cooking and still never got them so, we cancelled that part and left.",

They have an elderflower cocktail that I get every time called the \"Mexican Gin and Tonic\", but the margaritas here are also amazing! We love the ceviche and dim sum, the Dan Dan noodles are to die for, and you have to start with the fresh tortillas and table side guac. If you sit on the left, you can watch them make the steamed buns, noodles, etc all from scratch. And the bartenders are always awesome here! If you sit to the right, they are making the fresh tortillas, enchiladas, etc.. if you have not been to China Poblano yet, you are missing out!",

    "text": "Located in The Cosmo, I have to say I have mixed feelings.    My wife and I came here for a quick snack on May 9th around 3 pm.  Unfortunately, our quick snack turned into an hour long exercise in patients.  The food was okay to good, the service was although polite, slow and disappointing.  We were seated quickly, as there were only 10 or fewer people in the restaurant at the time, and ordered the Golden Pigs and Quail Egg Siu Mai.  Let's talk about the food first.  The Golden Pigs: - These are fried and comes with a side of condensed milk.  Quite tasty and the condensed milk is not super sweet which was a pleasant surprise.  The filling of BBQ pork was also very nice.  It seemed like a good ratio of bun to filling, be aware they do come out hot! FYI if fried is not your thing they have a steamed variation without the condensed milk, and you will be pleased.  Quail Egg Siu Mai: - My wife and I are suckers for eggs, and she has been talking up these Siu Mai for years.  For me, it seemed like a pretty standard Siu Mai, but with the quail egg, it was something different and definitely worth a try.  Our waitress was nice, and we always had full water.  Unfortunately, our experience diminished from here.  After we had our food we did not see our waitress again for around 30ish min.  We even started to consider asking another staff member to find her when we finally saw her come out of a back room.   Overall, the food and atmosphere are interesting, but the service was unfortunate (as previously stated, the restaurant was fairly empty at this point), and the price point for the items I feel was high for what we got.  But hey it is Vegas!",

In my mind, either this place was going to wow me or it will leave me disappointed. Well...it was the latter.   We came mid afternoon so there weren't many people in the restaurant at all. We were seated quickly, and our waitress was attentive during our entire meal - big plus (service upped this place to the three stars I gave it).   In terms of food, nothing really stood out. While looking at the menu, the only thing that sort of stood out to me were the taco combinations. Other than that, everything else on the menu was very much either a Chinese dish or a Mexican fish. Not much fusion going on with the menu items. My sister and I ordered more than enough for the both of us. I'd say we tried a little bit of each type of dish offered. I was not impressed by any of it. The only thing that I remember was the golden pigs entree, which consisted of fried bbq pork buns served with condensed milk. Strange combination with the condensed milk but it worked really well.   I wouldn't recommend this place but if you're dying to give it a try, I'd suggest going with different tacos if you want the whole Chinese Mexican fusion experience.",

Tuna was good, most of everything else, sad to say, left me feeling like the dishes were bland and missing that umph factor. The agua Fresca was great.

I started with the lotus chips and they were crispy, and uniquely seasoned.  I then got the Lengua taco and the lamb potstickers.  Both of these were also delicious and perfectly seasoned.  Since I had been imbibing at the Diamond Lounge I did not order any drinks.  The food was 5 stars easy, the service was between a 3 and 4, but the prices . . . man it hurt.  Seriously $6 for one taco, and that was it just the taco, and $13 for 5 potstickers?  I know it's the strip but I'd expect these prices up on the third floor of the Cosmo not the second.  But, the food was so good I'm going to give 4 stars and will probably make my way there again.",

    "text": "Really wonderful, adventurous casual dining on the strip.    While I am not a fan of the Cosmopolitan's brand of chrome and disco decorating, I was immediately taken with the bright colors and fusion of elements in the China Poblano Restaurant.  Immediately one becomes aware of two contrasting cuisines.  As you enter there are two bar areas where diners can watch various food preparations.  One side is devoted to Mexican food and the other to Chinese food.    This dichotomy is reflected in the menu as well which is divided up largely by types of dishes and the two cuisines.  A closer look shows a comingling of cuisines within though.    The 20 vegetable vegetable fried rice was so yummy.  As full of vegetables as its name suggests.  The Lamb pot stickers were served under a dome of incredibly thin and delicate pastry.  There was the hint of cumin lurking around the dish that was a beautiful almost haunting harmony with the delicious pot stickers.  One of my favorite dishes while I was in Vegas!  We also enjoyed the guacamole and Golden Pigs (fried AND steamed pork dumplings that were served with a sweet condensed milk sauce, a wonderful balance between sweet and salty flavors).  Finally a Jericalla which was described as an Oaxacan chocolate custard with  passion fruit and chocolate sorbet.  This was an amazingly light and lovely dish.  Beautifully layered as a parfait with solid chocolate in with the creamy elements and contrasting in texture.  Just an amazing combination of tangy fruitiness and deep chocolate flavor.  Really worthwhile.  While this is slightly expensive for casual dining, the quality of ingredients, thoughtful food combinations, beautiful presentations and wonderful service made it a terrific choice for us.  I will brave the overstuffed glamor of the Cosmopolitan for a repeat visit.",

    "text": "The first thing that went wrong was on the wall. At first, I liked the decor --a casual, colorful blend of Chinese and Mexican motifs --Chinese opera masks, Oaxacan wood carvings, red glass lanterns, bicycle wheels on the ceiling (not sure the country, but cool). They also had portraits that were actually large projections, that switched every few minutes. So you had Frida Kahlo, the Dalai Lama (not Chinese, by the way!) and random peasants.  What pissed me off before our food even came out was that they were projecting a photo of Mao. If you were running a German restaurant, would you put up a picture of Hitler? Because that's basically who Mao was in China. I know it's considered hip and trendy to use Mao's image as a cultural icon, but THIS MUST STOP.   Okay, on to the food. The next thing that went wrong was they brought out the wrong order --we'd ordered duck tongue tacos, they brought the beef tendon with kumamoto oyster. My husband took a bite and realized the mistake --and also that the oyster was really off. I could smell it across the table, and no way should a fresh oyster smell that strong. Kumamotos are my favorite oyster so I am very familiar with a fresh, sweet specimen. This was wrong.   Our server was very friendly and seemed sharp, she took it away with an apology and we got the duck tongue. I took a bite and it was pretty tasty. However, I couldn't get over the fact that I was chewing on a tongue, and tender and flavorful as it was, I couldn't take another bite.   However, the salsa that came with the tacos was DELICOUS. I was eating it with a spoon (since I didn't want any more tongue). One of the best salsas I've had, it ranks up there with Papalote's in SF and Cancun's in Berkeley. Really amazing.   The Beijing glass was fresh and healthy --a big mixture of chilled glass noodles and veggies. It was underdressed, however, and finally we asked for extra dressing which helped a lot.   The gazpacho was a big surprise --we expected the traditional soup presentation, but instead, got a bowl of cut fruit, and a server squeezed orange over it, tableside. It was delicious, with jicama and dragonfruit in the mix.   We also ordered the scallop ceviche at the recommendation of our server and this was a HUGE disappointment. For the price (about $12, I think) we got 4 bay scallops (tiny). The concept was cool --they were served on top of limes that had chiles and sugar on top. You popped the scallop and followed with a squeeze of sugary, spicy lime juice. It just underwhelmed because the scallops were so diminutive and less than stellar. For that price and with that presentation, you expect stellar and full-sized diver freshness.   The dessert we got was great --Tres Lychees (a play on tres leches cake). The lychees came three ways --in a milk-soaked cake, whole, on top of the cake, and as a foam.   Our whole lunch bill came to about $75, and I was still a little hungry afterwards. If you go, I recommend being extremely judicious with your ordering, read reviews to see what's good, and maybe stash a snack in your purse.  Some people have complained that there isn't enough \"fusion\" on the menu --but most of the dishes (even if they're listed as \"Mexican\" or \"Chinese\" only) have a twist. We discovered that the twists are not necessarily explained on the menu, and you may get some big surprises (like our gazpacho). So I appreciate what the restaurant is trying to do --blend two disparate traditions in a delicious way, surprise with ingredients, and use molecular techniques when it enhances the food.",

    "text": "I was intrigued by the idea of Chinese/Mexican fusion but unfortunately in a combination of poor service and incomplete menu descriptions, my visit was less than stellar.  We ordered the $12 guac which was pretty much like guac anywhere they make it fresh, so the price was a bit crazy.  The house-made tortillas were fine, but not mouthwatering buttery softness like when I make them which is weird cause I just use Maseca...  The shrimp mojo was the best item we ordered though I thought the shrimp had a very strong aftertaste.  The combo of sweet garlic, poblano, and onion was good though  The spring rolls were fried so in my world that would be an eggroll. Either way the veggie mixture inside was less than average in taste.  The flavor is indescribable except that I would not ever order them again.  The refried beans with cheese and crema (less than a spoonful) came out looking like a turd on a plate.  Even the waiter laughed when we looked  at it.  They were not worth 7 bucks but it was average.  And finally the Glass noodle dish.  I ordered it to be my main course.  It was cold, which was nowhere in the description, which was a disappointment to me because the restaurant itself was freaking Antarctica.  Besides the initial disappointment, the flavor was not great, salty and over-bearing sauce drowned the veggies.   The portions are very small as well.  The waiters kept bringing food to our table that wasn't ours and then looking at us like we were crazy when we explained we didn't order anything like that (mostly it was tacos and later a soup\\...wtf?)  Also the food came out like sushi, one plate at a time in completely random order. It was weird. I usually do not take stars away for service, but in this case the service was so disorganized and bizarre, I felt I must.",

    "text": "I was super excited to have been able to get dinner reservations at China Poblano on its opening day.  Having grown up eating a lot of Chinese and Mexican food, I was excited about this fusion of such different cuisines.  Furthermore, I had high expectations for a restaurant of Chef Jose Andres.  Unfortunately, I was underwhelmed by my experience at this new casual dining restaurant.  First, service was not up to par.  Despite our 7 o'clock reservations, we had to wait about 45 minutes to get seated.  We were comped guacamole and chips for the long wait, which was a nice gesture.  Servers kept bringing us dishes which were meant for other tables, which became annoying after the third time.    Second, the food was just okay.  The menu is split up between Mexican cuisine and Chinese cuisine, with a few fushion dishes.  I thought the whole menu would consist of fusion dishes. We ordered a variety of dishes from both sections of the menu -- nothing really stood out as being delicious.  The al pastor taco was good.  The fries with mole was interesting. The hot and sour soup was salty.  The dishes are all very small, tapas style and they bring out everything as it is ready.   For dessert we ordered the chocolate warrior and giggling buddha.  Both looked interesting but neither tasted good.   As for decor and ambiance ... the restuarant is casual, the atmosphere is fun.  The decor is kinda tacky looking.  With all of its bright colors and funky decorations, it kind of reminded me of Pink Tacos.  All in all, I love the concept and the history behind the fusion of Mexican and Chinese food. I also feel like the China Poblano has a lot of potential.  However, it definitely has a lot of kinks it needs to work out before it can be a big hit.",

I would say the Mexican food is a little better than the Chinese food, but either way, you can't really go wrong, and some of the fusion dishes aren't too bad either. The agua frescas are pretty legit, and the service was really nice. The presentation is pretty hip and unique, just like the Cosmopolitan itself.   My family and I came here after waiting eleventy thousand years for some other restaurant upstairs that had fish that was supposed to look appetizing... We were more than impressed with this place. Thank you, China Poblano! You make me feel like I'm at home.",

    "text": "I love Oyamel and Jaleo, so I was eager to see Jose Andres' latest creation, and I had really high expectations for China Poblano.  I had this idea that Mexican-Chinese fusion would be the love child of two of my favorite restaurants, Oyamel and Myers+Chang (a funky pan-Asian restaurant in Boston).  We decided to try the Asian side of the menu at China Poblano, after we realized that there weren't that many fusion dishes on the menu.  The good: the tuna ceviche was great - the soy sauce did NOT make me think of sashimi at all! overall, it was a flavor combination that I wouldn't have thought of, and I liked the texture of the ceviche with the walnuts.  The monk's noodles had a nice texture, and I was pleasantly surprised by the fried rice - it really distinguished itself from your average fried rice.  As far as drinks go, I had a margarita with sea salt \"foam\" (standard at Oyamel, still tasty here).  The lemon drop with \"noodles\" was clever, and it tasted like your standard lemon drop.  Yes, I bought into the cutesy presentation, and I enjoyed it.  Also good: the service.  The host table seemed a bit confused but once we were seated, everyone was great.  Our waitress had recommended the tuna ceviche to us over the scallop ceviche, since she thought the scallop portion was too small, and I always like candor from the waitstaff.  There was also a mistake at the bar, and when she saw a drink about to go to waste she brought it over to me (yay!)  The entire staff was very attentive.  The bad: we had the \"when pigs fly\" pork steam buns, and something about the texture of the bao was off.  Even worse though, the meat was underseasoned.  The same thing goes for the ten treasure noodle soup and the monk's noodles - they looked great but the broth was underwhelming.  It's difficult to get the broth just right (Tampopo, anyone?) but if you can't, maybe you shouldn't offer so many noodle soups on your menu.  I'm willing to give China Poblano the benefit of the doubt, as the restaurant was only two weeks old when we visited.  I will probably eat here again... but there are so many restaurants to try on the strip, so I'm not sure when or if I'll be back.  The bottom line is, Jose Andres does a fantastic job with Mexican cuisine and tapas, so if you're going to visit, maybe that's what you should stick with.  My visit to China Poblano just left me craving a visit to Myers+Chang and Oyamel.  I didn't take the ceviche and tacos at Oyamel for granted before, but I will certainly appreciate them a lot more on my next visit.",

It was amazing. I would have never thought to try a place that entailed Chinese and Mexican foods, but I am glad I was invited to try it.

Besides their intimate connections to communism and controversial personal lives, they also both appear as projected photographic wall art at China Poblano.  I adore Frida and collect mementos from her life.  I can't say the same for Mao but don't mind seeing his picture every so often at this restaurant.  China Poblano has a fresh concept, delicious food that mixes quality ingredients with creative combinations, and an artistic urban atmosphere.  If you come alone, sit at the bar, it's communal and gives you a peek into the kitchen with cooks demonstrating their skills.  If you come with a group, sit by the wall with exhibits of colorful Chinese masks and Mexican figurines, which appear surprisingly similar when displayed together, (these tables also have cushioned benches that are much more comfortable than the ones under photographs of Mao & Frida).  Everything is tapas style, we discovered about 2 items per person is a good amount of food.  Scallop dumplings are very tasty and served in authentic bamboo steamers.  I also love the Dan Dan Mian, wheat noodles in a spicy ground pork sauce.  Hot & sour soup has real content, not just broth.  But my favorite is the Singapore Sling, their signature cocktail.  It's very good gin paired with pineapple juice that they make in house plus other delicious things that come together for a fabulous concoction.  They did forget a couple of our orders so it seems like management is still settling in.  All forgivable under this prismatic fun house where I can eat delectable fusion food.",

Expensive but doesn't deliver! Small portions come with hefty price tag. One small (not even Taco Bell sized) taco is $5.50. Extra $1 for dipping sauces. Expect to pay at least $30 for two drinks and at least $50 for two entrees.    Waiter was rude; he asked if I actually had a food allergy or was just trying to cut weight. Seriously?",

The Chinese food well let's just put that aside.   The tacos are pretty good but seriously these prices are absurd even by Vegas standards especially the portion size.  I can get tacos in many places in LA or OC for $1.25 that are many times superior (2 Guys, Taco Leo).  Taking aside these huge issues the tacos are good but not as authentic - I don't care how many abuelas you have making toritllas in the front of the house.  The Chinese food is like a more authentic version of PF Chang but dim sum style.  Again the food is tasty but about 3x in price of much better stuff I can get in dozens of places in SGV.   The Bazaar is great this place is just weird and expensive.",

Hello - but the part of the fish my husband ate may not have been well cooked. Instead of agreeing and apologizing, the manager came off as rude, unbothered and displayed very bad customer service to clients that really loved the food at China Poblano.

I still have the bad aftertaste in my mouth and I swore never to go back there again. EVER. I'd love to give them zero star if I could.   The service: slow and inattentive.  The communication between servers and chefs was terrible - our dish somehow went \"missing\" and we waited and waited, we didn't get any apologies for that.  We ordered our drinks first hand, but the drinks came towards the end of the dinner. If we didn't remind them, we probably wouldn't have gotten them.   Their guac was so bland and expensive. We mixed it with the salsa because it was that bland. I can make a better batch of guacamole for 10th of the price. The siu mai was just bad. Everything was so small and expensive for no apparent reason. I'm sorry I even wasted time and money on this place.   Ok, maybe it's fine to go one time for the novelty of the Mexican/Chinese fusion idea, but definitely not worth the price. They made so many mistakes and failed to make up for it all! The waitress came and suggested that she was sorry, but please, we all knew she didn't mean any of it when she sounded and looked so irritated the whole time that I was complaining about the entire experience in front of her. I don't remember if I tipped, but if I did, I shouldn't have.",

    "text": "We ended up here at 4:00pm in the afternoon on a weekday after being turned away from both the Buffet at the Cosmopolitan and from Holsteins.  I have no idea why they were both closed, but regardless, this was our 3rd choice of dining and we were massively hungry as my husband and I had a busy day of running around town all day.  As others have said, every dish except some of the salads and noodle dishes are served as small plates.  Everything is massively overpriced, however, as if you were ordering regular entrees.  I have been a fan of Jose Andres since I saw him on 60 minutes last year, on Anthony Bourdain's Washington DC show, and his activism regarding the Child Nutrition Act that went through Congress recently.  He had so much heart and passion about food that he serves, that it made me want to come visit his restaurants at the Cosmo, eventually.  I didn't really see the heart and passion at China Poblano.  Concept wise, it is cool, but in execution the food doesn't really work.  We tried both the Chinese and the Mexican side of the menu.  When Pigs Fly - these are just steamed pork buns.  My husband ordered these and liked them but felt they weren't memorable.  He still misses the pork buns from Pike Place Market that we used to get all the time.  Har Gau - I ordered this, and they were soooo tiny.  The shrimp was okay, but because they were smaller than my pinky and chopped fine, I believe the flavor suffered.  There was supposed to be pork belly in it but I could not taste it.  Pancita al Pastor Tacos - husband ordered this and thought it was the highlight of the meal.  I had a bite and thought it was okay, my favorite part was the fresh pineapple.  Queso Fundido - This is just melted cheese with roasted poblanos.  While it was good, there was nothing remarkable about it.  The menu stated that there was supposed to be white tequila in this, I could not taste it.  Again, my favorite part was the poblanos, but I wish there had been more.  Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice - okay so I ordered this because the concept of twenty vegetables intrigued me.  I thought maybe it would make the rice extremely light and fresh.  While the presentation was pretty (see the picture I posted), I found the execution of the rice to be very heavy and greasy.  It was kind of a disappointment.  I was happy to see they added some silky tofu in the dish, as obviously it was created with vegans/vegetarians in mind.  For the inflated price of almost $17.00, this was the most expensive and overpriced dish of our meal.  My husband's barber apparently cuts the hair of a manager of this restaurant. While I have no idea how restaurants in casinos operate, he does not work directly under Jose Andres, but for the Cosmopolitan directly.  So this might be where the disconnect is as far as the quality of food versus the price of such a well known celebrity chef.  Maybe Jose Andres should visit Vegas more often and make sure the staff knows how to cook the food he puts his name on, as I've seen Charlie Palmer done at his restaurants when he comes to visit every month or so.",

    "text": "I was one of the few people up bright and early after a night of partying and decided to trek the strip with one of the girls. We came upon this restaurant and got lured in by the window displaying noodles being made. I suppose this isn't so much an \"Asian fusion\" restaurant; it merely serves both Chinese and Mexican food \"side-by-side\" as it advertises, which doesn't seem that great, does it? I mean, one side is going to suck, right?   And it's not that great. Granted, I only tried the Mexican food, but at 13 bucks for some shiu-mai, I'm not that much of a sucker. So my friend and I went for the tacos.  I got the barbacoa and was told the mushroom was highly recommended. At 4.50 a pop, I'm expecting some high quality stuff. But alas, all I got was some pretty ho-hum tacos on a nice looking frosty plate. My friend ordered the cochinta, and said she'd come back for that again   We also ordered off the brunch menu. I forget the name, but it's akin to a glamorized version of nachos topped with fried egg. Extremely forgettable.    I will give them this though - service was AMAZING. These were some of the nicest fellows ever and really made us feel quite comfortable. Unfortunately, I don't think the food is up to par.",

Even though portions were small, each dish was very high quality.  If you're looking to get stuffed to the point where you want to vomit, then head to the never-ending selection of buffets in Vegas.  If you want to be surprised and have a lively conversation with your dining partner(s) about the delicious food you're eating, then you have to try this place.  Here's what we ordered:  -Rou Jia Mou street sandwich:  Wow!  So tasty and good.  The bread part reminded me of Northern Chinese scallion pancakes (minus the scallions) and the pork filling was so good. -Tuna ceviche:  High quality dish with some surprising crunch.  I had to ask the waitress what gave the crunchy texture and it turned out to be amaranth seeds which I've never had before. -Barbacoa de res tacos:  Good.  Nothing to complain about. -Sui Mai scallops dim sum:  Yes, it's a traditional dim sum item you can get in any dim sum restaurant but done very well. -Cajeta flan:  Very creamy and smooth.  Great dessert but I thought the addition of the ice cream was unecessary.  -Singapore Sling:  So good, I had to drink 2 of them.  Perfect before hitting the slots ;)",

Therefore, i set my bar preeeetty high for this place and expected greatness.  What i got was decent mexican AND chinese food.  many of the reviews were right, its not some type of amazing fusion blend of the 2 but more so of the 2 cuisines in one restaurant.  The tongue(lengua) tacos were very delicious, but after having some authentic tacos from the ghetto side of vegas, it made these ones look like a joke as there was no special kick to it.  We also tried the dan dan noodles which were pretty unique out of all the dishes we ordered, but for some reason didnt hit the spot.  I couldn't taste too much of the unique flavors as it was just plain spicy.  Overall, its not a horrible place, but nothing spectacular to earn a 4-5 stars in my book.",

Both were fantastic. We ordered a dim sum sampler and each piece was a bite of heaven.   The fried rice was probably my least favorite dish, and I was very underwhelmed, especially with all the hype of it being a 'not to be missed' dish. Not bad, just nothing special.   The empanadas were great. I am picky about mole, but it was great.   The dan dan mian noodle dish was so-so. I probably would reorder it again, but again nothing bad, just not very memorable. The server said it was very spicy (and I love spicy) but I didn't get much heat at all.   Overall, good dining experience. Next time I will probably stick with the tacos and dim sum and maybe some ceviche.",

I tried two dishes.  The deep fried wantons and the Don't Be Jealous hot and sour soup.  Both dishes were delicious.  The wantons were like an appetizer size, but the soup was definitely like a full meal.  The only drawback with the soup is that the pork was a little large to eat easily with the little spoon provided.

The drink menu is excellent with many fresh and creative cocktails that are inspired by a fusion of Chinese and Mexican. They also have a large variety of different mescals.   This is definitely a small plate restaurant, so order at least 2-3 plates per person and share to experience as much as possible. The shrimp mojo and tacos ( try the cochinita and lengua) were great!  The tuna ceviche was more of a poke and less seafood ceviche, but still good.

Yes you have to pay for the chips, but this is the Cosmo so expect to pay more for everything.  Next we had the dim sum selection- so tender and light, followed by the ahi tartare with avocado chunks - so tasty!  Also tried the BBQ pork taco with marinated onions on their homemade very thin flour tortilla.  Will return here again next time in Vegas!",

    "text": "When we heard about a restaurant that \"fused\" Asian and Mexican food, we were just too curious not to give it a shot.  We stopped in for lunch, and we started with a couple of nice cold beers.  When perusing the menu, we had a really hard time making a decision.  We wanted to try a couple of things, but we did not want a big meal.  Our server said one of their \"signature\" starters is the tableside prepared guacamole, so we started there.  Once we saw that portion size, we knew we could not eat a bunch of other stuff, so each of us selected two tacos (carnitas and chicken).  Honestly....the guacamole was the BEST, and it was a big portion with lots of chips.  So, with the tacos, which were also VERY good, it was plenty of food.  That left us with only one disappointment which was that we didn't even get to try the Asian food.  We sat near enough to a couple of other tables, where we had conversations with others who did have other things and everyone agreed.....everything they make is very good.  Give it a try!",

    "text": "One of the biggest disappointments in Las Vegas. The concept mixes Street Asian food and Street Mexican Food. The concept with \"To Go\" windows on two different sides for both cuisines is clever and I was thrilled to try this place as I love street tacos and I'm a huge fan of Jose Andres. If he came to this restaurant to eat he would be ashamed to have his namesake on this venue between the less than average food and pathetic service. We ordered a few of the tacos at the window and it took THIRTY MINUTES for four tacos! The restaurant wasn't even busy. If it took street vendors that long ANYWHERE they would be desolate because no one would wait that long for street food! Totally ruins the whole point of ordering street food from a window- if we wanted to wait that long for food we would have sat our butts down in a booth somewhere. After the build up and anticipation from the long wait we were starving. I figured it's Jose Andres so it will be worth it once we get the food- perhaps even up there with Kogi. Unfortunately, the food was terrible. The tacos were messy to eat, and somehow with all of the sauce and food packed into the taco, it still managed to be terribly bland and there was absolutely no flavor. Hard pass on this place!",

    "text": "I was intriged by the concept of this restaurant, Chinese and Mexican but not fusion only two cuisines sharing the same room but is unavoidable like anything else that you put together for a long period of time it will eventually somehow mix to create some kind of a new twist of the two....enter the Viva China Taco.  Viva China Taco, beef tendon and Kumamoto oysters is one item that I found that had some kind of asian and mexican mix. I thought it was ok, the tendons are thinly sliced and fried and raw oysters placed on top. Te texture was not what I expected though, soft on the outside, crispy and crunchy on the inside...next!  Silencio tacos, made with duck tongue, another chinese delicacy that talked its way into the tortilla,  tasty and sweet because of the fresh lychee that tops the taco but nothing too memorable, something I would only eat once in a lifetime and now is done and over with.  After the less than stellar appearances of the viva China and silencio tacos I decided to stick with the tried and True. I ordered the carnitas, baby braised pork topped with chicharrones and a green sauce, also I ordered the Baja style fish taco which ended up being the best of the tacos I tried that night but at 6.50 a taco it was expected, those two bites had better be packed with memories.  This may be a chinese and mexican restaurant, two of the most economic cuisines, but being this another creation by the famous Spanish Chef Jose Andres, be prepared to drop a heavy peseta. Service was awesome, everyone from the hostes to the servers were very attentive and efficient...definitely not chinese service. The room is nicely decorated, very modern, very colorful and fun, not the typical mexican sombrero on the wall...it is more of an Asian theme.   Next time I'm here I'll try some of their Chinese dishes or maybe I'll try some of the other mexican plates or why not, I might just be in the mood for some CHINACAN and order both.",

    "text": "My husband and I ate here last night, and it exceeded my expectations!  We both tried the MasterCard tasting menu, which came with a variety of dishes to try and two \"mini cocktails.\"  The staff was extremely accommodating and tweaked my husband's dishes since he does not eat seafood.  We started with guacamole, which was creamy and spicy (but not too hot). It was served with warm tortillas instead of chips. We had more guacamole than we could eat with the tortillas, so we ate some with the other courses as a garnish. Our first cocktail was the salt air margarita, which was delicious. The salt foam was fun and tasty. Next I had the tuna ceviche, which I would never have ordered, but it ended up as my favorite dish. The dim sum course was ok (the siu mai was flavorful). The veggie rice was really great - I can see why other reviews have complimented it so frequently. The spicy shrimp was cooked perfectly and packed a punch. We had spicy noodles (which I think was a replacement for the shrimp for my husband) and it was awesome too. The texture of the noodles made me think they were home made. The taco was good (pork I think?) but not as unique as a lot of the other dishes (we still ate every bite of it).  The last cocktail was something with bourbon and grapefruit, which was a crazy combo, but it worked. Dessert was churros in a delightful chocolate sauce which I could have drank straight from the cup.   I would give this 4.5 stars if I could. If we were in town longer, I would go back and try more things (or even just order the guacamole, cevice and rice again!!). I totally recommend China Poblano and will definitely return in the future!",

The noodles were coated in a spicy flavourful pork sauce but the portion size was really small. We barely could have two spoofuls each. For $14 a plate i expect a larger portion especially when the idea is one plate per person. The Lamb Potstickers did not show up for a very long time, but when they did arrive were delicious. We also tried the Carnitas taco and Siu Mai Traditional. Both dishes were ok but on the portion size felt really small. I really think they need to mention the fact that these are small plates which are meant to be shared. Loved the addition of gold foil on my sui mai. My husband tried the Salt Air Margerita which is a unique creation and deliciously refreshing if you like salty things. Service is a bit slow and getting a place might be hard, but if you are willing to sit at the bar and eat a bit then this might a be a fun place.",

    "text": "I wasn't sure what to expect from a Chinese Mexican hybrid restaurant. The two cuisines are literally worlds apart and I don't associate one with the other. But it kind of made sense when I saw the menu. Instead of combining the two flavors on one plate, the dishes fall into either one of the two food categories. It's still a little odd to see Chinese noodle dishes next to tacos on a menu but at least they're not mixed together in the same dish.   My boyfriend and I chose to go the Mexican route and each ordered a taco (Hongos for him and a Pollo a la Parilla for me) and the queso fundido to share. We also ordered a side of chips and salsa to use with the queso since the dish is only served with a side of tortillas. The queso is quite stringy and a bit difficult to scoop but tasted great. Of course, how could you go wrong with a bowl of cheese?!? Ordering the chips was a good decision though as it gave more variety to the appetizer than just making quesadillas. My chicken taco had great flavor and, since I asked for the guacamole on the side, I was able to put a little on the taco and use the rest to dip my chips in. My boyfriend had no complaints about his mushroom taco. Were they worth $5? Probably not but this is Vegas and the $5 taco was still one of the cheapest options.   Our friends went the opposite route and ordered mainly off the Chinese side of the menu. They were far less impressed. First, they started with an appetizer of ceviche. For $15, you would think that it would be served with some kind of chip to scoop the fish but just as we had to order chips for our queso, they had to order chips for the ceviche too. While our table agreed among ourselves that this was odd and not what we've experienced at other restaurants, the waiter insisted that this was normal. I can't remember exactly which other dishes that they tried but I think one was the steamed buns. They weren't feeling the dishes though.",

Yea it was a chicken mole but instead of chicken they had it to where you dip the fries in the mole sauce. It was soooo good. It is a bit pricey and the portions are small but the tacos where a better deal and taste so good.",

Drinks were fire. Had the Mexican gin and tonic (forget the name) but it was amazing. They even brought us champagne and like 4 desserts to share on the house. Would definitely come back to have dinner again.",

Our Mexican food was ok and the Asian food was outstanding!  The dim sum is to die for and had little gold flecks.   I had a salt air margarita which was perfection. Our chips and salsa were great but the tacos were dry and sort of boring. The Dan Dan noodles were my favorite.   Ambiance isn't great. We were near a door to back of house and constantly saw trash and dirty containers every time the door opened.  Tables were basic.   All in All I liked it, but they can improve in some small steps to turn this into a 5 Star food experience.",

They make their own tortillas fresh daily. What more can I say, fresh tortillas are the bomb!! You can watch them make the tortillas also so you know it's fresh. They also make dim sum in front of you, it's so mesmerizing. Everything we had was delicious. If your staying at the Cosmo or near by China Poblano is a must. Can't wait to return. Thanks Sergio for the great experience.",

We were nervous about the menu (being from Texas) and had high expectations. We ordered a few tacos and the Golden Pigs which was highly recommended. Tbh the golden pigs did not wow me first bite. It was a little on the too sweet side especially for an appetizer. Bites two and three however were a different story. Perfect buns! (I've only said that to husband) it was delicious! Our cups never emptied and our table was always tended. Definitely a place we will be more adventurous next time! And definitely a next time!!",

We had a good size group, granted, but weren't even approached by the staff for water (much less drinks) until we had been seated for 20 minutes.  It was toward the end of the evening and wasn't even busy!  And when our server did arrive, we were treated with utter apathy...as if our mere presence was a nuisance.  But anyway, the food's good.  The Tequila Stinger is a wonderfully refreshing drink.  When Pigs Fly is a solid enough take on steamed buns, although when I tried a friend's Golden Pigs I found that dish to be far superior.  The carnitas taco is really excellent, a unique take on a common plate.  The Open Sesame noodles are light and delicious, especially on a hot Vegas night.  Overall, the service really soured the whole experience.  And the food was good, but there are so many incredible options in Vegas these days it'd be hard to justify returning here.",

Apparently there are FOUR diff kitchens that your food can come out of, depending on what you order. Let me tell you how the table next to us left US feeling SUPER awk. I mean, not their fault. The wife got her food. They got their shared food. Then the hubbys food...never came. Well, actually, it did...only 25mins after the wife finished her salad?? They were pissed. And frigid to the wait staff. Who did try their best to apologize. Multiple times. But really, nothing would get them to budge or lighten the mood. And these tables set up are RIGHT next to each other. Their bad mood was spilling into our table.   But anyways, it did take a while for all our foods to come. Nothing comparable to the neighbors experience. I meannn, at the end of the day, it's really not the wait staffs fault. It's the operations and kitchens tbh. It's a strange set up. I get it. You're trying to be interesting and unique...but it's not being optimized to its full potential.   ALSO. Aside frm the set-up and staff, the foods just not very good. Every single dish was over-vinegared. The bud and I thought it was super strange. I understand that you're trying to do a china-mex thing, but it just didn't taste very good. And you're charging $20 per dish!! After tip and tax, I paid almost $72 for just my portion...pretty ridiculous. My dishes were the shrimp mojo (main), woodear fungus (side), glass noodles (shared), and ceviche (shared app). The seafood was very fresh, but the flavors were strange!! Too much vinegar ahh.   Okay, overall, 2.5 stars, but I'll round up to 3...",

So being unbiased and disregarding the treatment here's what I think of the food and place.   Pros 1. Food is good and fun and interesting. It's a mix of a few of your favorite things from a Mexican or Chinese Restaurant. Tacos or Dim Sum, Posole or Won ton soup.  Definitely didn't leave full but I did drop $90 for me and two others (Not sure how that's a Pro) ah yes the set up is pretty awesome that's what drew me in!  Cons 1. That being said while the variety is fun and interesting, it is expensive and the way the menu works has the feel of appetizers and small plates. Tacos run at least $5 for one small taco. While it is good and you can taste the freshness, I know a couple places I can experience an authentic taco for $1.00.   As for the service, without getting to in depth, noticed a preferential treatment for the majority and I will leave it at that.   Good food, good quality, interesting variety, super expensive. Maybe don't come here if you are really hungry and on a budget lol....Check it out your experience may be different. Maybe...",

We ended up really indulging in the chinese side but every dish we had was needless to say, delicious.   The snow pea leaves salad was super refreshing, light, and tasty. The mango juice was delicious. 21 veggies fried rice hit the spot, as did the potstickers and chicken wings.  Now my friends were raving about the siu mai but i wasn't that impressed with it to be honest. it was good but it wasn't exceptional, and I can name a couple spots that i've had way better siu mai.  We dropped about $200 for four though. So get ready to feast!",

    "text": "Not sure much to add after over thousand plus reviews. Here we go......China Poblano ended up being our second foodie tour stop with my cousins. We were all first timers. We all enjoy eating and drinking. So talk about spread of food!!! It felt like ordered half the menu or close enough could barely walk out of the restaurant post dinner. Lol! Awesome.  My first impression was confusion to be honest. It not often see menu half the menu is Chinese and Mexican. Not that options are ever a bad thing in life. It makes me paranoid. China Poblano does great job of staying True to the two styles of cuisine.   Mexican side. Holy Guacamole!! It not often get fresh Guacamole. I can not say in words the difference it makes being fresh made right in front of u. Plus the show is little bonus entertainment. Light, just right amount of acid or lemon juice, refreshing, and fresh chips. I could have Guacamole and chips all day. I ordered two each of carnitas and lengths. The carnitas was by far the winnable of the two. The meat was cooked perfection and the fried chicharonn brings it all together. It pairing never think of but it works!! The lengths taco was ok. Lengua it was thin sliced pieces rather then diced. Different.   Chines side.. Twenty vegetable fried rice by far the winnah!!! Not sure if twenty vegetables in it. All I know was it had great depth of flavor, hearty, HUGE bowl of it, and fried rice at its finest. Mongolian Beef Lettuce Wraps was good. The beef had great seasoning  and enjoyed the dish. When Pigs Fly is basically Manapua but bland just ok. The same could be said for both noodle dishes had XO Rice Noodles and Chilled Spicy Garlic Noodles. Nothing memorable.   Service was truly five stars. Our waitress was very attentive, friendly, and made our first experience a great one!!!",

It was not very busy because of the time but the waitress asked us to wait to be seated... a long time...until my husband walked to her again and asked if the table was ready. I think she totally forgot about us.  Liked the interior and the service after we were seated. The food was not bad. Especially we ordered Kao Lao Lao which was quite interesting- the presentation and the way how to eat it. It's Steamed small noodle row eating with a dipping sauce. Very different from other Chinese noodle soup or fried noodle we normally see. Worth a try.",

    "text": "Is it pronounced \"chee nuh\" or \"China\" Poblano? Cause it's like Spanish, but it's also Chinese.   China Poblano was pretty high up on my list of places to try when I visited Vegas solely on the fact that I wanted to see what expensive dim sum tasted like. I've been to plenty of dim sum places and usually tend to see dim sum dishes cost around $3-$5 per dish. The prices are definitely on the higher side per item which is expected because it's Vegas.   The flavor/quality/price ratio was just not worth it to my party and I. Some items like the dan dan noodles were really good. One out of the three dumplings in the sampler we had was memorable while the others I could have done without. We also ordered some tacos and I don't want to say that my tastes aren't sophisticated enough, but the viva China taco tasted so crazy I will never forget what my breath was like for the rest of the day. It was potent, and not in a good way.   When the food was good, it was great, but when it was bad, it was bad. For the price I truly expected a unique experience, and I got it, it just wasn't very good. The service on the other hand was amazing and the server almost preemptively knew that the taco we had was going to wreck our day and asked if we wanted to take it off the bill.   Go for the experience, but make sure it's with some cash you don't mind gambling with. No pun intended.",

It only cost 100.00 and we each got one dumpling. 1/8 cup of their vegetable fried rice, one chicken taco, 1 poor excuse for a bun bao, and a 6oz unseasoned hanger steak to share with 10 people. So we had a total of three 6oz hanger steaks to split between 30 people.   The real insult was that they knew well in advance that this large group was coming and then screams \"HEY. DONT GO IN WITHOUT BEING SEATED\" after, we were already there and just wanted to get some fresh air because the environment is cramped.  The food here you can easily get a mom and pop Chinese or Mexican place at a much more reasonable price with much more flavor. I know it's a touristy attraction, but if you want to eat something good and not be berated - go somewhere else.",

    "text": "Came here with low expectations and was pleasantly surprised.  Prices are high, but food was interesting as all Jose Andres restaurants have been for me. Don't expect as much molecular gastronomy as Jaleo or Bazaar. I was surprised to see that many of the dishes were not actually fusion, but more like two types of food on one menu.   Would order again: Lucky 6- pricey, but actually very tasty. They give you 3 types of siu Mai- chicken, pork and scallop. They were all good  Xiaolongbao- we were really reluctant to ordering these since were Asian and have high standards for XLBs. Naturally I always compare any XLB to Din Tai Fung, but I actually liked this thicker wrapper better. There was a delicious consumme inside and the crab/pork filling was very flavorful. Very pricey but I thoroughly enjoyed it.   Vegetable fried rice- tried some of my friend's and made me want to order it next time. I've never seen a fried rice like this before. It was so sophisticated with baby root vegetables that were perfectly cooked. A great option for vegetarians, although ours was lacking a little salt or soy sauce.  Worth a try:   Dan Dan mien- lots of sauce and flavor, and what looked and tasted like homemade noodles. Very peanut-y and tasty   Roa jia mo street sandwich- TINY. This is not meant to be an entree, should be placed in the appetizer section. The bun was perfectly crispy and was stuffed with a soy braised pork.  Golden pigs- perfectly fried on the outside, bun was really soft inside. BBQ pork filling was disappointing, as it was more hoisin sauce-based rather than the traditional BBQ pork. I'd rather it taste more savory, so I didn't really care for the condensed milk dip   Table side guacamole- so delicious, but how can you go wrong? They make it as spicy as you want, and the homemade chips are perfectly seasoned  Arroz Chicharron- kind of like rice chips, served with their house made hot sauce. Really cool vegetarian option  Cochinita taco- really good, pretty small. The tortilla was really well made in my opinion   Would not get again: Silencio taco- duck tongue was really chewy. Lychee addition was odd, just wouldn't get again   Tamal Rojo: a little too mushy for me, but some might perceive that as a very moist tamal. I couldn't really see much pork, but the pork flavor came through. Wasn't a fan of the salsa rojo, but the side chicharron was nice to add some texture to the dish",

We were booked at the cosmopolitan hotel so we tried this place because it's convenient, why not?!! To our dismay we ordered chips and salsa and a margarita! All of our orders were not good, first of all the salsa tasted like a pasta sauce, similar to an arrabbiata sauce with all that onion and garlic taste. The chips were cold when they came and my margarita --- it had a weird taste, the foam on top was too salty! In short , we left , hurriedly picked the check up and moved on to the next restaurant! I do not recommend this place to anyone who's an avid Mexican foodie like me, if they can't get the chips and  salsa right then it's a lost cause coz that's a very basic Mexican dish!",

We thought it would be fast food Chinese and Mexican under one roof, but it's actually a fusion of the two.  The decorations inside were a bit off, but with Vegas anything goes.  The menu was more small eats/ tapas/ small portion type foods instead of large plates for each person, so sharing is a good idea.  I was a little skeptical about how the food would taste but it was actually good.  We ordered -   1) Queso Fundido - like a melted cheese and you eat it with corn tortillas.  Kind of a small portion, and somewhat expensive, but it was still good.  2) Pancita al Pastor - pork and pineapple taco.  It was small, but it was really good. 3) Hot and Sour Soup - came in a super large bowl, and tasted much better than the typical take out.  I think they added some mexican spices to this soup 4) Chips and Salsa - typical   Our bill came out to about $30, but it definitely was a light sit down meal, not really a full dinner meal.  All in all I was satisfied and the service was good, our waitress was very attentive and the manager stopped by our table to see how we were enjoying our food.",

    "text": "An odd combination, taco joint/chinese dim sum under one roof. I mainly ordered tacos. Lobster taco was amazing! Duck tongue taco was over powered with (soy sauce) that I couldn't really tell what it was. Lamb potsickers was different, in a very good way. Had one of the best bloody mary here. Service was terrible!!! Our waitress, Megan, did not know how to smile. She totally ignored from start to finish. The food was really tasty, but Megan's attitude was so horrible that I couldn't enjoy my food! I just wanted to quickly get out of there solely because of her. She cleaned my spot when I arrived, then took a million years to come back to take my order. Every time I needed to order more it was impossible to get her attention even though I was practically sitting right in front of her.",

The menu is mixed in quality, but three separate tacos - lobster, beef tongue, and crisped tendon with oyster-- are accompanied by flavorful salsa or spices and are world-class delicious.  Two big bites render them expensive, but far less than a few minutes at the tables or machines and guaranteed winners.  Excellent service, uncomfortable backless chairs, bright and fun ambience, a must stop apart from price and some duds on menu.",

    "text": "This restaurant is like a metaphor for Vegas itself - stylish to the point of distraction, creative and wonderful conceptually, and absurdly overpriced. And like just about every other Vegas restaurant I've eaten in, the food just seems not quite as wonderful as it should be. As a case in point, my dinner a couple nights earlier at The Palm. I've eaten at the Palm  100 times in probably 10 cities and its always consistently excellent. At the one in Vegas, it was good. For whatever reason, presumably quality of ingredients in the desert, I'm yet to have a \"holy shit thats good!\" moment dining in Vegas - even at the very finest places.  Anyway, back to China Poblano. The menu is really interesting and just about everything sounds great. You could probably eat there a half dozen times and be excited about trying new things. I had 3 dishes:  - lamb potstickers, which were good. Beautifully and unusually presented under a fried disk of something which I frankly have no idea what it was. The edible marigolds on top added their own interesting flavor note.It was good - basically the Vegas thing where it sounds awesome, looks awesome, but just tastes good.  - dan dan noodles. Also magnificently presented, with a very rich flavor of something different than the usual version. The hand cut noodles had a distinct and wonderful texture. And the taste was good. Just good. - a braised pork tenderloin special. This was a very complex dish with meltingly soft tenderloin with crispy on the outside chewy on the inside fried plantains that added the perfect sweetness to go with a complex mole type sauce and some diced fruit (not sure what) and some couscous. It was very good.  Now back to eating here a half a dozen times - yes you could, but you better bring a big bankroll. I had 3 dishes (as they recommend) which was just about the right amount although I could have eaten more and a light eater probably would have leftovers. The bill - with one beer - was $60. While it wouldn't be the same innovative versions, an order of potstickers, dan dan noodles and roast pork - of similar portion size and similar quality (along with a beer) would be well under half that at a fine Chinese place.   If the food was as wonderful as the concept and presentation, I'd be in love with this place even at the absurd prices. With 2 drinks (or some wine) and one more dish I'd be pushing $100 for a casual meal for one, but if its fabulous so be it. But they haven't hit that here - its just another one in the line of super-creative, insanely stylish but meh food restaurants that defines Vegas. I'd go back (and I have to say, I couldn't possibly think of a better hangover menu) but only because its Vegas (and I'd hope it was a comp, or someone else was buying!)",

Definitely try the salt air Margritas with the lovely salty foam, we were more focused on the Asian side of the menu, other than the guacamole which was very good and came with great warm tortillas. Tried the 20 vegetable rice, the dancing eggplant (awesome with the twirling bonito flakes-you have to see it!) and the 'when pigs fly' steamed bbq pork bun. All dishes were very good and the buns were amazing. Definitely one of my favorite places in Vegas.",

Its three tiny scallops... and thats it!    Tuna ceviche:  A decent portion and has good flavor.  Rou Jia Mo Street Sandwich:  Amazing!  The best thing we ordered but I think I killed it in three bites.  Its a slider size so dont expect a lot of food.  Chips and salsa:  Pretty good but can you really mess this up?  Be sure to order this since its the only thing thats free refills... that includes the tiny sodas.  Overall, skip this place and go to Marquee and get wasted.",

    "text": "Writing this review to counter some of the low ratings, which surprised me after I had a positive experience with the restaurant. Yes, prices are higher, but what else would one expect for Las Vegas, let alone a Jose Andres restaurant?  Be prepared to drop at least $60 for 2 people, but it does provide some unique dishes and ambiance that makes it worth going.    Went there when the brunch menu was up.  A rundown of some of the items we got: Barbacoa Taco-- the beef was soft, tender, and flavorful.  Cactus added a good texture.  Great taco choice. Rou Jia Mo Street Sandwich-- tiny and cute, but also very tasty.  Didn't know what to expect, but essentially a small circular pita-like bread and some braised pork put in the pocket.  Tender pork and fried bread=yum.   Carne Machaca-- probably the least impressive dish, the spicy sauce overpowered the whole dish and the beef cut into strips was chewy and dry, not very tasty.  I wouldn't recommend getting this... **Chilaquiles con Chorizo-- comes served in a small skillet, and DELICIOUS, hearty and filling.  Great balance of sauce, tortillas, chorizo, egg and CHEESE.  Seemingly simple, but the quality of ingredients makes a difference.  YUM.  If you go to brunch, I HIGHLY recommend getting this dish!!!  This dish made the trip worth it. **Tres Lychees-- was originally debating between this or the mango sticky rice for dessert.  Definitely made the RIGHT choice in going with this!!  The lychee cake was topped with fresh lychees, lychee sorbet, and a rum foam.  The rum foam was a bit much, but the lychee sorbet was fantastic.  Lychee sorbet + lychee cake = best dessert choice, indeed.  **Best of the meal.  I would get these dishes over again.  Bam.  Very filling and tasty, and we had a very attentive server (Christin) who wasn't annoyed that we kept adding to our order as we continued (instead of ordering at once). And the food came out in a timely manner.  Only mistake is that they gave us Chilaquiles when we hadn't ordered it, and they apologized and found the rightful customers.  But after seeing it, we decided to order it and was fantastic decision!   I'm grateful for the happy mistake.",

This one is definitely for the more adventurous eaters, but if you like truffles and earthy flavors this one is a can't miss.  Tuna Ceviche - Delicious and very surprising.

The portion sizes were terrible for the price and the bartender (since we sat at the bar) failed to tell us that the dish we ordered and appetizer would not be enough for a lunch for two. We ordered the pigs on horseback due to its hype. They were definitely the best thing we had though they were on the dry side and lacked something I think a crisp vinegar style dipping sauce could have easily fixed. We also ordered the Beijing Glass noodles which promised to be a light vegetarian dish to compliment our heavy pork break appetizer. The noodles came out and the whole dish was a little larger than my fist. More of a side really. It seemed like they had marinated everything in sesame oil and had little other flavor. Since we were still hungry we ordered a couple of tacos thinking the other side of the menu would be good. Wrong. The Tinga Poblano was really flavorless and the cochinita was even worse. The pork had a bland dipped-in-A1 taste and the onions didn't add anything to the dish other than filler that distracted me from the taco. The service was terrible. Our bartender was attentive to our waters but failed to help us decide anything and generally acted aloof and a bit shady. The decor was enjoyable and the idea I think is awesome. I really hope they step their game up. Probably the worst restaurant to eat at in the cosmo. I will not be returning.",

Instead of bouncing around the global menu like a worldly tapas joint, the dishes were a little imbalanced, non-sensical and downright combative as you would expect would happen if China decided one day to take on the southern area of North America. I found myself going back and forth trying to come up with some method to the madness and it just never really took. I was going to give it 1 star, but added another because the margaritas were tasty and it was within arm's length of the Aria Hotel and Casino, which could lend 3 more stars here as 5 is not enough to rate the timeliness and creativity of a brand new Vegas strip hotel...but that's for another rant.   Keep yourself in the eastern or western hemisphere when making the decision to give it a go. It just couldn't muster up the flair that a place like this would need to hide the fact that the menu is just lazy, I said it.",

As we were getting ready to leave, he picked up the bill counted the money and didn't say anything to us. We won't be coming back to this place.",

For $5.00 each though?  Way to much for what I got and what I tasted.  Came back a second day to try a noodle soup bowl, and it sucked.  It was a combo of Bak Choy and shrimp dumplings.  What was horrible though was the lack of flavor in the broth and the noodles were actually somewhat crunchy.  I really am sad to give this place a poor review, because the servers were actually decent.  However, I will  never come back here.  I feel like they won't be here too long.",

Not being overly hungry, we decided to share their golden pigs (fried delicate buns, bbq pork) and a duck tongue taco each.  We thought the golden pigs were fried mantou with bbq pork on the side, but they were actually fried bbq pork buns.  They were very tasty though, although they shouldn't have diluted the condensed milk.  The duck tongue tacos had such good flavors - very good seasoning and love the lychee chunks in there.  I would've ordered more but we were saving stomach space for dinner.  Price is high - especially when I have to convert it back to Canadian dollars but I really enjoyed the food.  Service was good and efficient as well.  I'm sure I would return to try their other tacos again!",

Ambiance: located at the cosmopolitan on the second floor ... cool vibes with 2 kitchens (Chinese and Mexican). It was pretty busy on a Wednesday night (around 8pm ish)...we had a table in the back of the restaurant.   Service: totally forgot our servers name but she was bomb ass! Our server went above and beyond making us happy!   Food: we ordered the following: Mongolian beef (excellent but did not really understand the lettuce situation), carnita tacos  (I thought pretty good but my wife not so much), and dim sum (outrageously good)... flavors were generally good but we've had better (for instance Mongolian beef at PF Chang's is better, etc.).  Drinks: we did not stop! Enough said on that.   Bottom line: if you're looking for something in your stomach and don't know where to go, this place is worth a shot! So many food spots in Vegas though!",

The Cochinita, made with barbecue pork and marinated onions, was tender and slightly sweet. It was delicious -- but it got blown away by the Tinga. The chicken mixed with chorizo and fresh chopped onion exploded with flavor.  No sides, but with the guacamole appetizer that was plenty of food.

We arrived around 11:45 and were seated right away.   Service was good, we were tucked away into the back which was nice. The noise level wasn't too bad given that it's open and there's a lot of noise coming up from the casino on the floor below.   We ordered 4 things- When Pigs Fly (the bbq pork buns), the DanDan noodles, the pozole, and the Papas Fritas. The pork buns were AMAZING, the DanDan noodles were really good but a little pricey for the size, the pozole was solidly good, and the papas fritas were nothing special, and I wouldn't order again.   We really wanted to try the cocktail sampler, but it was too early for us to start drinking, but next time I'd definitely get that! There were so many great options we'll be trying next time.",

The restaurant blends Mexican and Chinese flavors to make for a really diverse and interesting menu. Our server was super attentive and accommodating, which made for a great service experience. We started with the When Pigs Fly steamed buns, which were bbq pork. They were very tasty and I would definitely recommend. We also tried the chips and salsa and the chips were warm (always a plus), seasoned with a tasty spice blend and the salsa was unlike anything I've had before; it was almost as if they fire-roasted the tomatoes. Next we tried the fish taco which was tasty and the chicken wings tossed in chili sauce. While the wings had a good taste, they were extremely spicy. So much so, that we could not finish them so beware of that if you don't like spice.",

Like the decor but the small benches were not comfy after a day of deadlifts. In order, lamb pot stickers--decent. Juicy insides needed a fruit base or vinegar dipping sauce. The crunchy \"lid\" was flavorless. Next a squash salad with sweet peanut and plum sauce. Super bland unless you pile every component on the fork. Then Chile green bean noodles. Those were yummy with the pickled daikon radishes. Next skirt steak mole. Please! Where is all the great mole in the city?? We have a huge Mexican community. This was deep & smokey with Chinese spices but maybe a crema sprinkle. I don't know! They were so close. That wasn't too bad and dinner was looking up. And I was halfway through a mezcal old fashioned. GREAT drink.   We picked 3 tacos. Duck tongue, carnitas, fish. Uhm. The first two were just okay but the fish we so dry I didn't finish it. The sauce was sparse. I mean, come on, tacos need to drip or have enough flavor the separate elements don't taste better than the whole.   The subtly of blending two power house cooking styles can be done and maybe we were on the down swing of an old menu. The service was lovely & wait staff friendly.   It was a bummer. Go to Bazaar at SLS for Jose at his finest (charcuterie).",

    "text": "So nice I ate there twice. In town for a work conference and was intrigued by the fusion menu. The service was just incredibly nice and perfectly timed. Everyone here is genuinely awesome. What I ate:  Wontons: I've been looking everywhere for this thin wrapper for my homemade wontons, but I'll happily pay for the ones at China Poblano. Perfectly crispy and crunchy, with a solidly delicious filling and the dark soy sauce is yummy. Ask for some chili sauce to up the flavor explosion. These really remind me of the wontons that I've had in Trinidad so I'm obsessed.   Dan-Dan Mian: I liked this but the sauce was a bit salty for my taste and even though I mixed it, didn't feel like I was getting the right amount of pork/peanuts. That's probably user error. The hand cut noodles were perfect though.   Siu Mai: the traditional siu mai was simply delicious pockets of heaven. This is a must try!  Mongolian Beef Lettuce: this was also delicious and a large portion. Loved the shishito peppers and the sauce was perfect. The beef filet tips were also perfectly marinated.",

The staff is super friendly and the service is very fast (and I was hungry so my \"perception of time\" says a lot).  I hade \"18 Monk noodles\" and Papas Fritas (served smothered in a mole poblano and with queso fresco!): perfect and non-greasy portions.  I also tried \"La Vida\" cocktail and it was the perfect beginning. To end the evening I enjoyed the special churros they have... just perfection!

I really do suggest that you try to start with their chips and their signature salsa, so good! We select something different every time! This visit we had the chips and salsa and some of the tacos, which I think the fish taco is the best bar none! The taco selection is rather extensive so maybe try a few different ones. Moved on to the blue corn quesadilla, which was delicious! Please try any one of the Su Mai offerings and the When Pigs Fly! The Dan Dan Mian noodle dish was delicious and we always order that one. We choose not to add the vinegar to it but the vinegar comes on the side so you decide. The street sandwich is also a must! Nothing left to say but, please go there! It really is a different experience every single time...",

Unlike others, I'm not killing stars because of information I should have researched before going. Its Vegas. It's the Cosmopolitan. Suck it up.   If you come here hungry, bring your wallet. If you come for a couple interesting meal items, an open mind, and a desire to really have your tastebuds wowed, look no further.  Started out with a Silencio- duck tongue taco with lychee. Exotic and delicious. I didnt know I liked duck tongue until now, but I need to go find more immediately. The carnitas was not as good. Should have gotten two Silencios.  Appetizer was followed up with xiolongbao and the quail egg siu mai, and \"Mexican mimosa\" (passion fruit mimosa). The xiolongbao exploded in your mouth with the warmth of the veal consomme, perfectly complimenting the meat.  The Siu Mai was also excellent. 6 bites, but rich enough that you'll be fine. Quality over quantity. The quail egg was again, something I didnt know I needed more of. Everything ordered was worth it, in my opinion, and I'll definitely be back!",

They're a tapas style restaurant but their portions are larger than a normal tapas.   Mexican: Refried Bean Taco and Chilaquiles The taco has salsa with a creme that blends together. A friend of mine order this too and said \"I love meat but this taco is SO GOOD.\" The chilaquiles was a little more bland for me. The tomatillo sauce was delicious, but there was nothing else with it. So just cheese, sauce and chips. All of which was soggy by the time it came to the table, but the flavor was still great.   Chinese: Open Sesame Noodles A little too soy for my taste, but it would be a great summer time dish (it's served cold). This was a more hearty dish compared to my taco, tons of vegetables. This one dish could have served 2.   Extra points for understanding what a vegetarian is, and having their own vegetarian menu! Overall, great prices for portions.",

    "text": "My friends and I enjoyed a quick meal here right before we headed into Marquee Day Club on a recent Vegas Saturday. We had an inkling to try a breakfast place around the way but the line was just ridiculous so we actually went to China Poblano by accident. I'm sure glad we did. 5 of us were seated at the counter which was perfect as we were just looking for a quick meal before we got the day started. The host at the counter explained to us the whole concept of asian and mexican/spanish fusion under one menu. I was a little skeptical at first but you know what? The food I ordered was great. The concept? It works. I was pleasantly surprised. I shouldnt be surprised. Chef Jose Andres is the man.  It was suggested we try the tacos by our host and he did not steer us wrong. I had the carnitas taco ($6) and it was excellent. Shredded braised pork served with diced onions, pepper and cilantro and topped with chicharrones. It was really really tasty. The carnitas was legit and the tortilla was hand made. The crunch from the chicharron was great. It's like street taco style but about double the size of your typical taco truck taco and utilizing only 1 well formed tortilla. It was also double the meat you usually get from a typical street taco. I def recommend getting the carnitas taco.   The other appetizer I got was the fried wontons ($11.88) for 7 pieces. It was also very good. Great crunch on the outside and great pork/shrimp flavors inside. The accompanying sesame sauce was perfect with it. I also highly recommend this appetizer. So tasty.  Great food. Served fairly fast. Located inside our hotel at The Cosmopolitan. Friendly service. What more can I ask for? I've stayed at The Cosmopolitan many times and have visited plenty more and I've walked by this place so often never knowing how good it was. I wont make that mistake again. I will for sure be eating there again. 4 Stars. Easy. Gracias Chef Andres.",

    "text": "You should know when you are dining at a \"celebrity\" chef's Las Vegas eatery- you are most likely eating upscale Applebee's. Sure there are some exceptions but by and large the quality is subpar what you would find if you were say eating at a Jose Andres establishment in DC. You want the real thing you have to go to the source, not a cash grab restaurant deal. I'm not mad at the chefs who have done this, I would do the exact same thing if I was in their position.  China Poblano is the Vegas version of Jose Andres' DC China Chilcano. I like the concept. I chuckled when I saw the $45, 8 course tasting menu; I even ordered it on top of a few tacos. To the food. The table side guac was ok but not what I would expect for $16, too much salt, but I think it was to balance the unseasoned/unsalted house made tortilla chips. In the end it works and we finished it off. The salsa was heavy on the poblanos and smoke but we kept going back to it. The Mexican inspired dim sum was great as was the sweat pea salad. The beef tongue & carnitas tacos were solid. It was the 20 vegetable fried rice and mojo shrimp where it went off the rails for me and it became evident it was just upscale TGI Friday's .   The shrimp were swimming in mojo and a little undersized for what I was expecting. The fired rice was the main course of the tasting menu. There was a lot of it and it too was swimming in oil. I will say I liked the idea of a 20 vegetable fried rice and I plan on making it when I get home, just with less oil.  All in all it was good- everyone dining was happy. But in the back of my mind I couldn't help but think it didn't live up to the quality I expected.  Would I go back? Probably not, I would go to one of the many hidden gems off the strip in China/Korea town. Would I chose it over one of the other celebrity chef's Vegas money grabs? Yeah those tacos were legit.",

Mexican / Chinese food or Chi-Mex is a staple in NYC though usually out of a bodega storefront, this place makes the two cuisines a delightful fusion. Though the portions could be bigger / coming from an American that's a huge eye-roll, the food was delicious. Highly recommended are the dan dan noodles of which we got two orders and the mango sticky rice which we were tempted to order a second bowl of. Maybe I'm just a glutton but I really enjoyed the food and experience here. Even ran into an old co-worker with excellent food taste so, that helped to confirm my feeling.   Must try!",

All great.   ....BUT....There's no way to fully impose how disgusting the cochinitas taco was...but I'll try.  It tasted the way that sour, old cheese-dishwater smells.   I've only 'not' been able to handle food a time or two in my life. Chewing this taco bite was an experience I'll remember forever. It was both humbling and revelatory. It really puts the 'fusion' in Confusion.",

Everything is made in house... the drinks, the margarita mix, the noodles, everything is made fresh right there and it shows.... delicious. Well worth the money. Most places on the strip are a ripoff, this is pricey, but not insane and it is worth every penny, very well executed.   To be honest, I walked by this place probably 5 trips to vegas and it did not look or sound appealing to me, then finally we tried it and now I go back every time I am out. Somehow the chinese and mexican go well together and I have yet to try anything on the menu that is not good. The golden pig dumplings are exceptional, for sure try them.",

    "text": "I visited this restaurant on Thursday, 3/1.  the restaurant was almost empty and recommended by the hotel, the Cosmopolitan.    First of all, let me say the food is delicious, except for the desserts.  The service is so slow.  VERY SLOW its aggravating.  There were 4 people at our table and we all ate at different times.  We basically had to remind the waitress about the food.  I also noticed they had an acting manager, which took the time to introduce himself to us mid dinner.  We told him the food was good and that the service was lacking, he said he would take care of it, and then 10 minutes later we had to remind the waitress again about our next course.  Didn't make a difference.  We were there to have some drinks, it is Vegas after all, and to have a really nice dinner, but we didn't even feel like ordering a second drink.  What a boring dinner.  We complained again, at that point we just wanted to leave.  We asked for our check and we noticed the waitress took the check to the manager, and he said ok and brought the bill to us.  Not only was the service lacking, but we ordered more salsa and they nickled and dimed us $2.18 for the extra little serving of salsa.  I was shocked that a restaurant who charges $15 plus dollars per drink would nickel and dime us on the salsa.  We were charged 4 times for extra salsa.  Also the desert lacked any flavor, it was mango with whipped cream and rice krispies tossed on it.  Mostly whipped cream, this dessert should have been called rice krispies with whipped cream.  It was strange and not what we expected in a 5 star Hotel and Casino.  Vegas is all about the service, and this place is lacking.",

Lucku 6 shumai- if you're used to the Japanese or Chinese shumai that is a little sweet then this is not for you. It's more on the salty side but the flavor are unique and overall very yummy   Tacos- my husband had these, and said it was just ok   Dan dan noodles- very good, the noodle texture was on point. The portions aren't large, so be sure to order other side dishes  Foie gras buns- it was a special, but it should be permanently on the menu! Yes, it's that good!! The foie gras is perfectly seared and the combination of the tangerine and sauce was amazing. Easily the best dish I've ever had!",

We then got the tableside guacamole which we both thought was some of the best guacamole we've ever had since we were able to customize it to our liking. The refried bean taco and the mushroom taco were both excellent. Our last dinner item was the 20 vegetable fried rice. It was great, but not life changing or in any way better than most old school fried rice.   What really made our meal was the service. Our waitress, Kimberly, was not only kind and prompt despite the restaurant being busy, but she was paying excellent attention. After she took our order and realized that we ordered all vegetarian items, she came back to ask if the oyster sauce and eggs in the fried rice were okay and offered to omit them if needed. Then, when she made our tableside guac and we asked for the red onion and cilantro to be omitted, she asked if we wanted these omitted from our other dishes too. Maybe to some people noticing those things wouldn't be a big deal but we were really impressed that she was paying such great attention. We will definitely be back.",

Summary (on a scale of 1 to 5 stars): Food: 5 stars Drinks: 5 stars Atmosphere: 5 stars Service: 5 stars Price: 4 stars  The food is a marriage of Mexican and Asian cuisine. It's unique, and it's delicious. My favorites are the guacamole (medium style has just the right amount of kick); When Pigs Fly (steamed pork buns); Shrimp Mojo (shrimp with sweet black garlic and roasted poblano peppers); pork belly taco, lobster taco, tuna ceviche, and, the all-star, the chocolate terra cotta warrior. It's a chocolate mouse filled warrior-shaped chocolate with ginger ice cream, cookie crumbs, and caramelized banana. It is the most unique dessert I have ever had. Yes, ever. You have to order it. and you won't be disappointed.  Drinks: Food: The margaritas are phenomenal. You should get a pitcher.  Atmosphere: Vibrant, lively, and fun.   Service: 5 starts. All the servers I've had have been knowledgeable and attentive. Food starts coming out almost right away and continues to come out as it's ready. The hostesses are friendly too.  Price: It's not a cheap place, but it's worth the extra $ because the food is so good. Just not a place to come if you're on a budget. Definitely a place to come if you value a great meal.  Can't wait for my next trip.",

This is a cheaper version of a Jose Andres restaurant, (cause not eveyone can afford to eat at E)  There are a couple good menu items, the chilaqulies are good if you are a cheese fanatic, the pork belly tacos are great, with thin slices of pineapple, and the Dan Dan Mien is delicious with home made noodles. The lengua tacos were decent, nothing special but not bad. Remember everything here is tapa sized, very small portions. Each person needs to order about 3-4 dishes in order to get full.   Two menu items here ran about $30 which is very expensive for the average Mexican/Chinese food you get here. Yes its a fusion restaurant, but you can get better food at Komex. The place itself looks great. Very trippy looking restaurant, kind reminds you of a neon enfused hole-in-the wall.  But honestly, after such a disappointing first visit I don't think I could every come back.",

Presentation is very pretty, but the taste just lacks in flavor or texture. Tofu and avocado should not go in the same plate, duck tongue tacos were undercooked and slimy. Pear juice was super watered down.   Jose Andres, I had high hopes. It's unfortunate. I may still try Jaleo but my visit here is not giving me much encouragement!",

The steam buns were dry and the glob of hoisin wasn't really helping. The dumpling filling is ok and the noodle wasn't too thick, but pretty over priced. Yeah, I get it, it's Vegas!  But, I still want quality for the price tag that's being demanded. The tuna tartar was odd. It had some spice in it that wasn't fully ground, so the texture was crunchy without being a pleasant taste. Next time I'll hit up secret pizza when I am in the Cosmo.",

    "text": "I at here with a group of friends for lunch one day, one whom had eaten here before. I have stayed in the Cosmopolitan before and seen this place quite a few times but never stopped in, so I was intrigued to try a place that served both Chinese and Mexican cuisines. The mexican would be a hard sell though, since I'm from San Diego, but we tend to have horrible Chinese food so I figured it might be a good balance.  The wait staff was very attentive, and for that, I was very appreciative, and if Yelp allowed me to break out my star reviews into different categories, service would get a full 5 stars, while the food itself.... would get the 2. The portions are quite small, but that's to be expected in Las Vegas, especially for a sit down restaurant at a higher end resort such as the Cosmo, so the price to portion ratio honestly didn't bug me all that much, and the waitress let us know that it would probably be best to order at least 2 items from the menu apiece (although she did point out one or 2 items that had more generous portions). Again I really appreciated her letting us know this ahead of time.  The two dishes I personally had were the Dan Dan Mian noodles, and the Pork and Shirmp won tons, and the table had some chips and salsa to share. The Dan Dan Mian was an unmitigated disaster. There was decent spice to the dish, but it literally tasted like gooey flavorless chalk. I couldn't taste a hint of pork, or any discernible soy or pork flavor to the sauce, although the noodles were cooked well. The Won Tons unfortunately were also pretty much flavorless as well. So flavorless in fact that I couldn't tell which won tons were which (they serve you some pork and some shrimp), they were just small marble sized lumps of unseasoned meat paste. The Won ton wrappers themselves weren't too bad of a texture, a lot lighter and less greasy than some I've had in the past.  The chips and salsa were pretty standard, which I expected. It's hard for me to not be a chips and salsa snob when I live 15 minutes from the mexican border, and have tortilla chips made fresh, only feet from the table as we are sat. So they were decent for non so-cal chips and salsa.  All in all, I wouldn't go back again, but that being said, there was nothing so horrible that would make me tell someone to avoid this place at all costs, since tastes certainly differ from person to person, and the service was very good.",

    "text": "If it is authenticity you are looking for, obviously, you are setting yourself up for failure the second you step into this beautiful fusion restaurant. However, as a quintessential Angeleno, I much much more prefer fusion rather than those so-called authentic food. And China Poblano is the very reason why: it combines the distinctive taste of both worlds. Plus, it's Jose Andres (see my reviews on \"SAAM\" or \"Jaleo!!\")   So, after BF and I sat down, without any hesitation, we immediately ordered \"China Poblano cocktail experience.\" On an average meal, we each can drink 2 to 4 cocktails easily, and $32 for 4 cocktails that's paired with the dishes we are about to order? Who in their right mind would've missed that?  As for food, we ordered: Langosta (seared lobster taco, I love how they served this dish out first and the grapefruit on the taco worked like an \"amouse bouche\" and ) Viva China (beef tendon/kumamoto oysters taco, the thinly sliced tendon was deep fried to the point like ultra thinned cristino! ) lamb pot stickers stuck on you (this is probably BF and my favorite of the entire meal; juicy minced lamb wrapped inside of dumplings that's topped with crispy fried pancake. An absolute culinary success,) Traditional Siu Mai (with edible gold on top,) Dan Dan Mian (I love how surprisingly spicy this noodle dish was,) Shrimp Mojo (my favorite second dish, not to be confused with Jaleo's garlic shrimp, the mojo sauce was actually blacken,) tres leches cake (by far the best tres leches I've ever tasted, and trust me I've tasted tons of them,) and churros (this dish was served fresh, so when I bit into the churro I can taste the exterior crunchiness as well as the soft and moist interior, not to mention they were served with a cup of hot chocolate as dipping sauce.)  China Poblano embodies attentive and friendly staffs, delicious food, drinks, and dessert, plus, modern and \"fusionized\" decor. It also was the first restaurant we went to after we arrived and checked into Cosmopolitan. Thus, the impeccable dining experience at China Poblano set the bar up pretty high for the rest of this trip. If I do have to nitpick, I only wish they had more items on their menu. Please be advised this place serves \"tapas style.\" I honestly do not think it's fair for people to give it such a low rating based on the size of the portion.  I truly hope for those who haven't experienced China Poblano's uniqueness would give it a try. As for BF and me, we cannot wait to go back to Cosmopolitan again and pay this cute place another visit!!",

    "text": "This place is fun and I love the concept, but the execution culinary-wise is not quite up to snuff.  This is an interesting concept: Take the best of both culinary cultures, and blend some to create unique dishes. It's fusion, but not totally, since some of the dishes remain faithful to the traditional recipes.  We ordered and shared family style, so that meant we sampled a bunch of tacos and noodles. Some were nice hits, some were really bad misses.  Highlights: Huitlacoche Noodles - I've always wanted to try huitlacoche (corn smut fungus), and it integrates seamlessly into this Chinese-styled dish. However, they skimped on how much huitlacoche they gave. Also it takes on flavors so well that I couldn't tell what was the corn itself or if it just absorbed the black bean sauce. Still very tasty though. Pozole - I love pozole already and it's funny because there's tons of hominy in this dish (whereas the huitlacoche was lacking). The twist is that they give Chinese shrimp crackers to dip instead. Yum. Dim Sum - In general all the dim sum was good, but not great here.  Lowlights: Unholy Monk Soup - The blandest, blandest soup evar. Don't monks usually deprive themselves of earthly pleasures? Eat this and you'll feel like a monk too - this dish deprives you of all flavor. Don't give alms to this one. Viva China Tacos - This has oysters. I pretty much only like oysters fresh & raw with lemon. When oysters get messed with any more than that, they tend to taste funky. The rest of the taco - very good. The oyster part - bad.  So while this place has a great concept, some of the dishes just aren't very good. I like how they maintain both traditional and want to mix it up too. The bad dishes were very bad, the good dishes were pretty good. I guarantee that you'll have fun here though.",

    "text": "We were seated pretty quickly as a table for 7 at 7pm without having a reservation by two very hospitable staff. After 4 days in Vegas, the first positive vibe I picked up on was that the front of house staff were very humble, gracious and genuine - a welcome change to the a few of the other restaurants we ate at.   Despite the warm welcome, we were left sitting without a visit from a server for at least 10 minutes. And at most restaurants, this would be fine if not just slightly annoying. But here's why it was a much bigger problem at China Poblano: the menu and how/what you should order isn't easily decipherable without a bit of guidance (or having been there before).   I'd suggest to the managers of CP to have the staff who seats you stick around for an extra :15 and give a one or two line spiel on how the menu is divided, portion sizes, what's shareable/not shareable, and recommended quantity of order per person. We all started to confuse each other and actually started to discuss leaving to go to somewhere that was a bit easier on our we're-in-vacation-mode brains.   Our server came by just in time before we left and explained how it all worked, but then left and proceeded to give us another 10 minutes to ponder our life as well as our food order. He didn't take a drink order. So in the end, we sat for 20 minutes before we even get a drink order in. It's almost impossible to sit anywhere in Vegas for that long without being offered a drink.   Orders go in and the food starts rolling out pretty much immediately. Highlights for me were:  - Queso fundido - Lucky 6 Siu Mai - Gan pung ji chicken (table fave) - Carnitas taco - Chipotle salsa  Lowlights:  - Viva china taco - Lamb pot stickers  - Guacamole (tasty enough, but poor value)  There were a few mix-ups with the service - some people didn't get their tacos till the rest of the table was pretty much done their food. I chalked that up to the shared-plates approach, but a bit more attention could have easily saved one upset and ignored diner. We were also missing a side of the \"monk chilli sauce\" which was ordered because we were - and still are - very curious as to WTF it would actually be.   Loved the decor of the restaurant and felt that the music was very well selected. Not really sure about the choice to project a picture of Frida Kahlo up at the same time as Chairman Mao. When you take into account his political decisions were responsible for like 40-70 million unnecessary deaths,...  Maybe it's art or irony, I dunno. It certainly sparked a conversation at the table where we concluded that the designer was probably more into the superficiality of the icon of Mao, like Che, rather than the politics and the fact that he's pretty much one of the greatest modern mass murderers. And we're looking at him while eating. In Las Vegas. Ok, maybe it is irony. Unintentional irony? Moving along...  TL;DR version: interesting spot, food was generally tasty, I found it priced pretty reasonably with a few exceptions. The menu could use a bit more explanation - ideally, immediately upon arrival - and the table service could be a bit tighter and attentive.   I also think this menu would benefit from being slimmed down by a few items, and then perhaps divided by portion size.",

It's ironic that his image is used in a restaurant since under his... um... leadership... millions starved due to his wackadoodle policies. And, let's not even mention the whole torture and death thing.  But, I digress. My wife and I stopped by China (pronounced \"chee na\") Poblano after already eating dinner a couple hours earlier. So we only got 2 things. Now, on to the food...  Langosta tacos ($16) - lobster, salsa Mexicana, arbol chile sauce. 2 per order. The lobster was a little tough and the tortilla was too small compared to the amount of filling. The tortilla was also too fragile -- it tore apart as I picked it up to take a bite. They should have doubled up the tortillas for each taco like typical street tacos.  Coctel de camarones ($12) - fresh shrimp, jumbo lump crab meat, tomato, avocado. It's basically a soup bowl of salsa with a few shrimp and bits of crab meat and avocado thrown in. It's served cold, which I wasn't expecting. If you like fishing out your food from a bowl of salsa, this is the dish for you. I wasn't a fan.  Singapore sling ($11). A delicious cocktail made of gin, brandy, pineapple juice and some other stuff. It goes down a little too easy.  The bottle of coke that my wife ordered was cool. It's hard to screw up Coke.  I really want to like this place. I love the concept and I'm a big fan of Jose Andres. I'll gladly go back to try other dishes because there are many items that sound delicious.

Maybe I was starving, but it was very tasty. I do regret not getting the queso dip (I think), dang table next to me was rubbing it in my face.   The dan dan noodles were good, nothing to write home about. The chiqules (I butchered another dish name) was amazingly tasty. Um the Pappas were delectable. The 20 vegetable fried rice was also super yummy. And for dessert, the tapioca pudding ball thing was great.   Me: really 20 vegetables?   Server: \"I promise you that our fried rice has 20 different local and seasonal vegetables.\"  Here's the negative: price and size.   Me: Will this fill us up?  Server: \"I always suggest each person order at least 4 items, think tapas.\"  That wouldn't be a big deal if everything wasn't $9 or more.   So in all, it is pricey (hey, its the strip) but totally worth trying if you don't mind \"taking a mark\" against yourself. That's casino talk, right?",

    "text": "Conceptually \"Chinese Mexican fusion,\" China Poblano is billed as a blending of the two rich cultures.  Located on the 2nd floor of the Cosmopolitan somewhat hidden in the back, the restaurant is certainly eye catching.  With an entryway shaped like Buddha and \"Mexican Takeout\" windows on either side the campy feel is palpable, but acceptable.  With an interior of communal and separate dining tables, a noodle making station, and wall decorations ranging from Chinese Opera Masks and Lanterns to Luchador Masks and Oaxacan carvings the interior was colorful to say the least.  In addition to the fixed objects there were also large morphing murals - projections of famous and peasant Chinese and Mexican individuals.  To see the restaurant is to love it-or perhaps to hate it-it is certainly over the top.  Arriving in warm soft shells and approximately three bites each the first tastes of taco would come from Langosta.  Described as meaty lobster/mango/arbol chile sauce ($16 for 2 now, $6/e prev) the flavors were good, but unfortunately the lobster was slightly overcooked and I felt the chile sauce overwhelmed the subtleties of the sweet crustacean.  Silencio tacos - duck tongue/rambutan fruit ($4.5/e.)  Unfamiliar with rambutan until this time I was impressed by the fleshy sweet fruit and its ability to temper the salty, savory, and somewhat chewy tongues.  While not as nuanced as some of the other tacos, these are definitely worth checking out if only to experience the ingredients at a relatively cheap price.  The Cochinita tacos, described as Yucatan-style pit barbeque pork/marinated onions ($4/e) were good, but rather expected and unidimensional.   Savory and sweet the pork and onions melded nicely, but in total the flavor was no better or worse than a good pork taco anywhere else.  Carnitas braised baby pig/pork rinds/spicy salsa verde cruda ($4/e prev.)  With the braised baby pig perfectly done-supple, moist and flavorful-the addition of pork rinds added a lovely degree of crunch and saltiness.  Tempering the other two dishes and adding a bit of spice plus vegetal acidity the salsa was spicy without being overly so-in my opinion they should serve this salsa instead of the chipotle version with the tortilla chips.  Coctel de Camarones fresh shrimp/jumbo lump crab meat/tomato/avocado ($12.)  Essentially a whole lot of underwhelming salsa in a bowl with a couple of snappy sweet shrimp, thin shreds of crab, and chunks of avocado plus tortillas for dunking it was almost as if someone forgot to add salt, or spice, or vinegar, or really anything other than the listed ingredients which simply were not of all that impressive quality.  Love Is In the Air heirloom tomatoes/sugar air ($8.88) was much simpler in ingredients and much more complex in flavor.  Nicely presented in a large bowl with what must have been two fresh whole tomatoes and a splash of vinegar the dish was topped with an \"mg\" manufactured foam full of delicate sweetness that acted only to enhance the natural flavors of the tomatoes beneath.  Lamb Pot Stickers Stuck on You vegetables/crispy lace ($11.88 now, $8.88 at our visit) delivered five pockets of lamb, cabbage, radish, and smoky seasonings inside a crispy lace shell.  While slightly oily, the lamb itself was impressively cooked and not a bit gamey-with the melange of vegetables elevated by the cumin and black pepper this dish was clever and tasty with obvious contributions from both Hispanic and Chinese cultures.  Ocean Nest scallops/crab/shrimp/pan-fried egg noodles/seasonal vegetables ($10 at our visit and now $22 w/ king crab/lobster) would be a successful yet rather ordinary dish.  With crispy noodles resting in a gentle fish broth at the base and three head-on shrimp, three scallops, and a few chunks of crab interspersed with bok choy, spinach, and onions the flavors all worked and the textures were nicely done-at $10 the dish was a steal, but lobster or not I don't think I'd recommend it at the current price point unless there was a good deal more seafood.  The Unruly Monk with hand-cut noodles/bok choy/wild wood ear mushrooms/poached egg ($16) was served in an enormous bowl with perhaps a half liter of broth, boiled bok choy, a single egg, and a plethora of mushrooms the dish would be a nearly mirror experience of the Ocean Nest-a nicely executed dish, but no better than could be made at a local Chinese restaurant in most mid-sized US cities.  In the end I think the verdict is still out on China Poblano - I'm not willing to rule it out, but I'm also not ready to say the \"concept\" (which is exactly what it is) \"works.\"  While certain dishes worked to great effect, others merely represented decent versions of Americanized ethnic food, and some were simply underwhelming.  Looking at the menu only 2 weeks after my visit I already see many changes and given Andres' propensity for exploration I've no doubt the menu will continue to evolve as they find what works and doesn't.",

Two separate bars surround different cooking apparatus - steam baskets filled with dim sum on one side, and grills for tacos on the other.  The guacamole ($15) is fresh.  \"When Pigs Fly\" ($13+ for four) was nice but nothing spectacular.  The carnitas taco ($5+ for one) had an interesting twist with pork rinds on top.  Everything was good but not great.  The major downside is that it's just too pricey for the quick bites.   Interesting but limited drinks.

    "text": "Admittedly, part of the reason I may be a little hard on this place is because I was planning on spending about seven bucks on a slice of pizza and a diet coke at the hidden pizza place in the Cosmopolitan before exiting Vegas, but a last second swerve turned into throwing down over $30 here instead.  Anyway you look at it though, I just don't think this place was all that great.    Although the whole concept of having Chinese & Mexican food on the same menu might sound interesting, at the end of the day it's not as if the menu here is combining the flavors of both cuisines into some sort of fusion dishes (THAT would be interesting...I'm not sure if it would be any good, but interesting).  The menu is essentially divided into Chinese & Mexican sections.    I decided to go w/Mexican.  I had two two tacos & well as chips and salsa to be exact.  I had a chicken mole taco, which was okay.  I'm a huge fan of mole sauce, and I can't put my finger on what it was exactly, but I just wasn't a huge fan of the mole here.  part of the problem was I think they used too much of it.  It pretty much drenched the chicken.  I also had a fish taco.  It was nothing special, pretty much your run of the mill fish taco.  I was just looking to get a little food in my system before hopping on flight and not expecting to get a full meal.  That's exactly what I got.  Each taco was about two or three bites.  As for the chips and salsa...once again nothing special.  One of my dining companions went the Chinese route.  She got soup and some sort of gyoza, which I tried and thought was kind of greasy (she felt the same and felt her soup was okay).    Between three of us we spent about $90.  One dining companion ordered the same two tacos I did and we split the chips and salsa (the third got the soup & gyoza).  A big portion of our bill was the diet cokes we ordered (which  were a necessity IMO after all the alcohol we consumed over the weekend).  They were $5 a pop each for an 8 oz bottle and we each had two.  The food at China Poblano isn't horrible, and the small portions are what's expected, but I still wasn't a big fan of this place...",

Came here over the weekend with a bachelorette party and I think everyone thoroughly enjoyed their food and drinks.  Between me and two other girls, we split: papas fritas (fries with rich mole sauce), open sesame (chilled noodle salad), Beijing glass (cellophane noodles in soup), tuna cevhiche (veeeerrrrry interesting crunch), and dan dan mien (noodles with a spicy kick).  I had a Mexican Mimosa and other people in the group had the lychee sour cocktail and blood orange margarita.  Seriously no complaints about the food except that the portions are tiny.  However, considering how many dishes we ordered for three girls (we eventually cancelled our order for 20 vegetable fried rice), I think we did just fine.  Sure, it was a little pricey, but you're in Vegas and you're at the Cosmopolitan.  The Strip is littered with Panda Expresses if you want something cheap.  Now that I've returned from Vegas, and my coworker (who recommended China Poblano to me) and I are discussing the different dishes that we've eaten here, I'm itching to go back.",

It says you can do family style, but some of the things on the menu are bowls of noodle soup and things that are hard to share.

    "text": "Went here close to a month ago and just getting around to posting a review. We've tried several other restaurants at the Cosmo and have become fans of the resort and it's food offerings. The experience started off not so great, with the hostess service a bit frenzied and disorganized. There was no one at the hostess area and a bunch of us milling by the entrance not sure what was going on. Once seated, everything changed. The server was awesome...cheerful, knowledgeable and attentive. The service seemed a bit rushed at times. We ordered six different things and the time in between servings was sometimes not enough. I have no problem with the portions, which are on the small side and for the most part really aren't suitable for sharing unless you order a bunch of things.   I'm always about quality and not quantity, and the quality was excellent. These dishes, sauces, etc. aren't just slapped together. They are creative, complex and well executed. The prices for small plates is high, but again, Cosmo on the Strip, what do you expect.  Now for the food:   Vegetable spring roll - delicious, but nothing really set it apart from all the other good spring rolls.   Dan Dan Mian - wheat noodles in a spicy pork sauce. OMG. It's been a month and I still can't stop thinking about it.   20 vegetable fried rice. The price will blow you away, but have to say we really enjoyed it. The time and effort that goes into this dish is incredible and you can literally identify all 20 vegetables finely chopped in perfect proportions.   Carnitas taco - awesome. The spicy verde cruda sauce...I asked for a side dish of it and almost drank it.   Pancita al pastor. Had never tried pork belly, and the combination with pineapple was intriguing. Good, but not my favorite.   Queso Fundido - outstanding, with a nice slightly burnt top to the cheese, perfect texture and great tortillas.  The beer was cold but could have been colder.  Will definitely be back.",

The food was eclectic and spectacular.    the decor was fun.  a mix of Chinese and Mexican art.  On one wall was a panel of different Chinese opera masks and Mexican art pieces.  The other wall had two large video screens with images of Chinese and Mexican people which changes.  The feel was casual and elegant at the same time.  Our server was Nicole.  She was very courteous, knowledgeable, and gave great recommendations on food.  On her suggestion, we ordered the day's special:  marinated beef skirt steak with poblano peppers.  It was full of flavor.  It tasted better with their homemade guacamole and tortillas.  I also tried the duck tongue taco.  I know it sounds strange, but the flavor was great:  sweet with a crunchy texture of the tongue.  It had a few pieces of lychee fruit on top also.  The scallop ceviche was fun too.  a fresh scallop served on top of a small wedge of lime.  You're supposed to put the scallop in your mouth while squeezing out the lime juice at the same time.  Lastly, the dessert was excellent.  I don't remember the name of the dessert, but it came in a chocolate shell in the shape of a Chinese soldier filled with chocolate mousse served on top of ginger ice cream...very unique.  Overall, a great experience.  It's a fun restaurant.  The main downside is the price.  the dessert itself cost more than any other of the dishes we ordered.  The food is served tapas style, so you only get a small amount per order.    we ate mostly from the mexican menu on this visit.  On the next visit, I'm gonna try some of the Asian fare.",

The concept is basically glorifying street food from China and Mexico, and by glorifying I mean marking the price up 200% and decreasing the size portions to basically nibbles.  The funny thing is, the whole concept behind street food is that it is really good and really cheap and you don't have to pay $4 for a taco the size of your pinky for it to be delicious. This place turns that truth on its head by doing exactly the opposite -- charging you a ton of money for mediocre \"tastes\" of food. I couldn't help but feel like the owners of this place are bleeding the patrons white, that is the bottom line people.    For the price of food and all the press I was expecting this place to be upscale.  It's not that either. Avoid at all costs.    **This review is based upon trying the following: --pomegranate margarita (didn't like at all, too tart) --When Pigs Fly --Dan dan noodles --Lengua tacos --Pork belly tacos with pineapple --Carnitas  Can you believe all of this was $100+?

    "text": "We were looking for a place to eat at the Cosmopolitan and stumbled upon this restaurant with an interesting concept.  We were seated quickly and had our own table (some of the tables are common).  If you are a vegetarian, there is not much for you on the menu as mostly everything (especially the Chinese side) has pork.  What you will get is very little for your money.  The Siu Mai is tiny, the soups are legit but small and the mexican coke is $6.  The biggest problem is that the food comes to you at different times so one of our friends got her tacos after we were 3/4th of the way through our meal.  I understand that they are working with different kitchens but come on....",

The mongolian beef with lettuce looked like dog food, actually dog food looks better. a few pieces of diced beef (the size of half a penny) thrown on lettuce. Bland and overpriced.  My friend didn't finish her monk noodle soup. Bland and overpriced.  The hot and sour soup is GOOD.",

The only restaurant without a long wait was China Poblano and while it wasn't our first choice, we weren't disappointed!  In fact, we were pleasantly surprised.  The restaurant is very quirky in design with numerous tapas style dishes of Asian and Mexican influences.  They had cocktails from both ends of the globe, our cocktail of choice was the Singapore Sling (highly recommended) and we enjoyed some dishes from both origins.  Cochinita tacos were delicious, as were the Lemon Tree Shrimp.  All-in-all, a bit pricey for the amount of food you get, but it was expected.  After-all, we were at the Cosmo.",

    "text": "So expensive for such small portions...they must be high! That was the least filling $120 lunch I've ever had. There were 4 of us and it came out to $30 each.  Chips and salsa: I appreciate the warm chips. The salsa had and ok flavor, but lacked some freshness. Maybe it needs cilantro or onion.  Tacos: We ordered 3 different of their tacos(pancita, cochinita, and barbacoa). Nothing special in the way of flavor. Every taco had a chunk of fat in it. And at $9 for 2 tiny tacos that adds up.   Lamb potstickers: meh, not really anything better than you would get in the frozen bag. They were light on flavor. We asked for some sort of sauce and the waiter obliged, but reminded us that that sauce doesn't normally come with the order. The sauce added sssooo much. If it weren't for the sauce I would have had a hard time eating it.  Gazpacho something: a fruit salad. This was very good, but again a very small portion.  Tuna ceviche: I didn't eat this because I don't like tuna, but from what a heard one of the better dishes of our lunch.  Shrimp mojo: recommended by the host, it was pretty good, but really oily.   Overall: I wouldn't go back.",

    "text": "Such an interesting concept in a gorgeous new casino on the strip!   What initially caught my eye were the neon signs on either side of the entrance. One proclaiming \"Mexican Food\" and the other \"Chinese Food\". Being a Mexican food junkie, my friend and I saddled up the bar on the Mexican side of the restaurant surrounded by cool Lucha Libre masks. We watched the Mexican women make fresh corn tortillas by hand behind the bar.   I started with my token order of chips, salsa and guac. Oh..my..God!! The chips were to die for (What is that seasoning?), the salsa had a nice spicy kick and the $12 bowl of guacamole was huge & fresh!  We then split an order of chicken tacos which are small and come ala carte. The corn tortillas were as delicious as they looked! Naturally, I washed it all down with their signature salt margarita which had an amazing lime tasting foam on top.  I can't vouch for the Chinese side of this joint but the whole restaurant was buzzing with energy and I am still dreaming about the food a week later....",

    "text": "I seriously have no idea why the average is SO low for this restaurant. I have been to China Poblano twice now, and it can't get better than this!  I am a foodie and know good food when I eat it, so please take this review to heart!  China Poblano is a \"nice casual\" Chinese/Mexican fusion restaurant at the beautiful Cosmopolitan Hotel in Las Vegas.  I have never stayed here, but I can just imagine how beautiful the rooms must be, given the interior of the hotel's main floor.  China is a very eclectically designed restaurant, definitely great for striking up some interesting conversation topics.  Allow me to rate what I have eaten there.  Everything has been amazing!!  Queso Fundido - THIS IS A MUST if you like cheese.  One of the best queso dishes I have EVER tried, complete with handmade, fresh tortillas! Chilaquiles - Delicious and filling...not necessarily sure you need to get this if you are getting the queso fundido, as it is the same cheese. When Pigs Fly - Awesome \"dim sum\" style pork buns...yum! Beijing Glass Noodles - Wonderful cold noodle dish, sort of like a noodle salad...that might not sound that intriguing, but this is a must try as well Papas Fritas with Mole Poblano, Mexican Cream, and Queso Fresco - A great fries dish not to be missed! Twenty-vegetable fried rice - This is what they are famous for.  It's good, but not my fave of what I have tried.  People I have gone with tried the pork street sandwich...they were underwhelmed.  They also tried the Dan Dan Mian noodles.  I had a bite and they were really good!  I have also heard that the guacamole is just okay (like any other table side guacamole), but I still plan to try it one day.  This is my go-to restaurant for Friday nights in Vegas...definitely give this one a try!",

    "text": "I lived in DC for a while, so I am a frequent visitor to Jose Andres' restaurants and an avid fan.  I was really excited to try his new restaurant in Vegas, and it did not disappoint!  I came here with a group of 4 people, and we ordered 11 dishes I believe + 2 desserts.  They have a few chefs working at the front of the restaurant so people walking by can watch them make handmade tortillas and hand pulled noodles.  They also have two take out windows with a smaller menu that you can order from.  The decor is modern with Chinese and Mexican elements and made me think of something I would see in an Urban Outfitters catalog or on display at the MoMA.  The guacamole and hand made tortillas were to die for!  I could have just eaten guacamole for dinner.  And they have the best tortillas I've ever had.  My favorite presentation was the scallop ceviche, which they place on a carmelized key lime.  They lightly spray vodka on it, you eat the scallop, and then squeeze the lime into your mouth.  Almost like taking a tequila shot.  I also thought the hand pulled noodles were amazing and cooked to perfection.  We ordered the Unruly Monk soup, and it was very light and refreshing, but at the same time, full of vegetables.  I would probably come here for lunch and order just that and maybe a small side dish.  We also ordered another soup, Caldo Tlalpeno, which I thought was more fusion, and I also enjoyed that soup as well.  We ordered the Nice, but Naughty dish with lotus root and pea shoots which doesn't taste very Chinese because the pea shoots were somewhat raw but I enjoyed it nonetheless.  I also enjoyed the Chicken Ji Song and liked the presentation of it, especially with the fried sweet potato on top.  We tried a bunch of different tacos, and I think flavorwise, I liked the beef tendon and it was melt in your mouth tender, but also the greasiest taco out of all of them.  We didn't end up order any dim sum because I knew I could probably eat tastier (and cheaper) dim sum in Chinatown.  We ordered the flan and the happy buddha giggling taking a bath.  The flan is deliciously creamy and easily one of the best flans I've ever had.  The happy buddha is really cute and he really is taking a bath!  It's one of the most entertaining desserts I've ever had.  It isn't your normal jello.  They make it from scratch with fresh strawberries and use seaweed extract instead of gelatin, and it has a very smooth flavor.  It's very refreshing at the end of a huge meal.  The dishes aren't that expensive but they do add up very quickly, and we ended up spending more than I wanted to, but it was definitely a fun and enjoyable experience, not to mention yummy!",

    "text": "Sad my first official check in and it has to be given 2-stars.  It's more like 2.5, but in the restaurant world, you are either a 5 star or not, so we have to round down.  I really had a lot of hope for this place, but was sadly disappointed.    We had to make reservations as apparently this place gets pretty packed.  It is located outside of Marquee and next to Holsteins in the Cosmopolitan Hotel.  Reading some yelpers and also having followed Chef Jose Andres and his accomplishments, we figured we'd give this place a try.  The place was jammed packed on a Saturday night, and did have to wait a few minutes, but it allowed us to see the decor of the place which I really did love.  It's a Mexico meets China fusion restaurant which is a very interesting concept and worked out well, sort of...  The various tacos were great, I would say this is the highlight of the place.  Definitely a fusion of flavors and not your run in the mill choices - worth n order or two.  The other tapas were ok, some better than others but no where near the chef's best - after ordering them, we sat there thinking hmm, should I have just gotten a taco or two more instead?  The drinks were inventive: salt air margarita (salt foam on top) and lemon drop with jelly noodles (looks like chicken noodle soup).  The margarita was hard to say the least.  Strong salt in your face followed by a heavy handed (strong) margarita - was pretty hard to drink.  Then tasting the lemon drop (w/jelly noodles) was hard to sip in itself.  More like a soup than a drink, and strong yet again.  I thought it would be an alcoholic boba-ish drink, but it came up very short of those expectations.  All in all, for some tacos, its a great place, but anything else, maybe hit up Holstein's next door and grab a drink at the chandler bar before marquee.",

A blend of Chinese and Mexican food sounded a little odd to me but I went in with an open mind. The decor is eclectic and colorful. The noodle bar is cool to watch, with cooks hand rolling wontons and dumplings.   We ordered a wide variety of dishes on the menu. The carnitas taco was delicious and came with a unique pineapple concoction. The scallop siu mai was also scrumptious. Some of the other dishes were not really my flavor, which included the lamb dumplings, lobster taco, and a few other dishes I can't remember. I loved the Bangkok Noodles though. Excellent presentation, with all the vegetables carefully arranged in a colorful manner. The dish is then tossed together and tastes delightful.   The desserts are absolutely amazing! The pastry chef is super talented. The mango with sticky rice is heaven. It's an airy version of the classic dish. A must try.",

Other highlights were the guacamole and the tuna ceviche (both pretty unoriginal in terms of concept, but when prepared as perfectly as they were, you take notice). This restaurant does get expensive, especially for alcohol -- that accounted for half of our bill. I would recommend eating here, but drinking elsewhere.",

You have a choice to sit a a table in a very eccentric decor and portrait of legendary figures like Frida Kahlo and others projected on the walls, or have a front row seat by their cooking station and watch them make fresh tortillas and serve your dishes. The prices are not as expensive as you might expect from such a cool venue right on the middle of other establishments at the Cosmopolitan, but still not cheap, especially if you try some of their appetizers, which you have to. It is not a place I would come back to over and over, but it is clearly a touristy place anyway. Great service and friendly staff in general.",

Brightly lit and colorfully done, the ambience is something to look forward to.. The red tones bringing out a personality of its own.. We started off with the crispy veggie roll, stuffed with the glass noodles... It was the usual, but dripping oil... Nobody even wanted to go for seconds The crispy lotus root coated with sea salt was light and so good  We had the shrimp mojo, tasted even better than we expected, the chili, the garlic and the soy sauce perfectly coated the shrimp, was a total flavor explosion  The twenty vegetables fried rice was a good option for the veggie and was loved by the vegetarians  We also had the Beijing glass noodles, it looked like some cold noodles and raw veggies but after mixing, the sauce did the magic.. It is mild, mostly peanut sauce I guess was worth going for seconds and we wiped the bowl clean.. The service was excellent too! Will come back when I am in the sin city again!!!",

    "text": "Ha ha, this restaurant cracks me up.  Okay, first of all, it's a Mexican/Chinese fusion restaurant.   Odd.  Second, it's owned by Jose Andres, who is absolutely one of my favorite chefs, but who is a master of Spanish molecular gastronomy, not either Chinese or Mexican, so what's up with that?  Third, it's in the Cosmo in Vegas.  Nothing makes any sense about this place ... and yet it works.  We were in desperate need of food after running the Vegas Half Marathon, and everything else in the Cosmo seemed to be swamped by suits from a convention.  This spot looked interesting, so we figured, what the heck?   Boy are we glad we did!  We had the char siu bao, a standard version of the Chinese dim sum classic barbecue pork in a steamed wheat bun, although theirs had a lot more barbecue pork inside than usual, which was a very nice touch!  We also had the wings with fermented black bean paste and a dry rub.  These were a great variation on your standard wings, the dry rub was spicy and salty, and gave the wings a lovely crispy exterior.  The fermented black bean sauce was okay, but I don't know how much it added to the dish.  The highlight had to have been the pork and shrimp shu mai with quail egg.  The shu mai itself was pretty standard fare (albeit a nice rendition), but they cracked a quail egg on the top before steaming it, so it came out with a perfectly poached yolk sitting on top. When you bit into the shu mai (please, do it in one bite), the yolk exploded, elevating the shu mai to something amazing.   Every dim sum place ought to adopt this!  Finally, we had ants climbing a tree, cellophane noodles with a slightly spicy pork sauce on top.  Another pretty classic chinese dish, and again done well.  We didn't try any of the Mexican, but if it's as good as the chinese was, we just might have a new favorite in the Cosmo!",

    "text": "I was mistaken; I was thinking the food served here would be some sort of fusion between Chinese and Mexican food.  Rather, they serve both.  The twenty-vegetable fried rice was recommended by the waiting staff, so I tried it.  It lacked a lot of flavor and was not at all like fried rice.  It was more of a kamut and vegetable salad mix, if you ask me.  The rice had a nutty flavor that was nice, though, and it paired well with the vegetables.  However, I would hesitate to call it \"fried rice.\"  The chilaquiles and tamale rojo were pretty good; I highly recommend the chilaquiles if you are a fan of cilantro.    Nothing really stood out to me about this place except for the churros--the churros were delicious.  They were served hot with a chocolate dipping sauce, which I think was made with Mexican chocolate but I'm not quite sure.  I wasn't a huge fan of the dipping sauce because I'm not a fan of chocolate that tastes like tootsie rolls.  The churros were melt-in-your-mouth, empty inside, crispy on the outside, and were just delicious.  I wasn't exactly too happy about the food, but the churros definitely brightened my experience here.",

From the moment you sit down he always greets you with a smile, and explains the restaurant and concept. He ensures all his guests are well informed and makes great recommendations based on what the guest indicates they like or don't like. I am not a tequila drinker at all and when I first looked at the cocktail menu the first time we came here years ago it is majority tequila which is understandable, however Sergio goes out of his way to make me something that is vodka based and creates something he knows I will enjoy. There are not a lot of bartenders that will go out of there way like he does. If you go here you must ask for Sergio as he makes this experience wonderful but he is also not intrusive. The food here is amazing as well you must try the 21 vegetable fried rice it is amazing, and you can never go wrong with some tacos or dim sum, everything is made fresh including the noodles and tortillas.",

    "text": "I think this will most likely be a letdown for most people. Given the breadth of variety and quality of dining options in Vegas, I would skip it. If you are a Jose Andres faithful and you just absolutely must, get the Dan Dan Mian.   First of all, the outside seating is not fun. You're basically sitting on glorified wooden crates and when we got up to leave everyone's rear was a little sore. This makes me sound like such a pansy. Not a dealbreaker on it's own, but just a note. Also, as others have mentioned, this restaurant is not a fusion restaurant. Not a big deal if you don't expect it, but just know that there's definitely no culinary cultural mash up to be had here.   Anyway, I went with two friends and we were pretty hungry and pretty comprehensive in our order. We got an item from each section of the menu except for soups and salads, because that's what the real pansies order. Here's what we got and what I thought.     Tacos: Tinga Poblano - I mean it's decent, but it's not what we were expecting. Not anything special at all. Also, teeny tiny. Very little chorizo. I know the chorizo is calling your name but don't do it. You end up with a $5 mouthful of regret. PASS.   Dim Sum: When Pigs Fly - Ugh. I didn't plan on this review being such a downer, but if I'm being honest, this is another pass. This tasted fine, but it was a steamed pork bun! For $14! We love steamed pork buns so we went for it, but expected some tender fall off the bone flavorful magic for this price. But like, it was totally standard and not special at all. PASS.    Noodles: Dan Dan Mian - This was pretty good. I'm a fan and if I came back I would get this again. It had a nice kick to it and the noodles had a nice al dente texture. I need to note that even though this is the one thing I will vouch for, it was a little on the salty side. But I'd do it again. PLAY.   From China: Twenty Vegetable Fried Rice - I am a sucker for any sort of endorsement ever. The waiter says Travel Channel liked it? Yes, ok, yes please. And then out comes this extra small portion of fried rice that is so not worth $20 and then you feel like, maybe the waiter played you like a fiddle. PASS.  From Mexico: Papas Fritas - I really didn't like this at all but to be fair I'm in the .001% of the nations's population that doesn't particularly care for fries. Also I never really like mole sauce because it feels misleading. You can't bill yourself as a chocolate sauce and not taste anything like chocolate. And sometimes I forget it doesn't taste chocolatey at all and I try it again and it's like UGH FLEECED AGAIN. But that's neither here nor there. PASS.  In hindsight, this really makes it sound like I hated it. Which I totally didn't, I was just very underwhelmed. As I'm originally from the DC area, I've tried several of Jose Andres' restaurants and have always been absolutely obsessed with all his creations. So maybe I've set the bar high because I've had such good things from his places before, or maybe I'm just extra judgey because I grew up eating both these cuisines so I've had much better at cheaper prices before? Dunno. Either way, despite being very hungry, all of us were just kind of like, meh, this is so not on par with his other restaurants. Again, nothing is terrible, it's just not very good. I think it just isn't worth the prices when there are so many more incredible options just a few steps away down the strip.",

I love Jose Andres.  He's one of my favorite TV type chef people.  Anthony Bourdain is also one of my favorite TV type people, so when one raves about the other, it's a good sign.   I wasn't man enough to try duck tongue or oyster Taco, but I hear that they are quite good.  The pork taco was very delicious with very appropriate accoutrements, like pickled onions with just the right amount of bite.  My wife was not impressed with the fish taco, but it definitely looked good.   The brussel sprouts were amazing.  The charred and sour notes just made the sweetness of the brussel sprouts pop that much more.  It was an unbelievable dish that I don't think I could every replicate without it being too sour or too burned.    The 18 monk noodles are something to behold  It seems simple and maybe a little expensive for what you get, but you can't just get hand tossed noodles anywhere.  Also there is a perfect blend of salty, sweet and savory.  I was worried they would be too salty, but they were perfect and the vegetables provided a great textural break.    Just spend $5 on the taco and have an experience.",

The taco I had was the black bean taco with habanero and creme fresh. (Simple taco but I'm craving it already as I sit here in the airport) Had the 20 vegetable fried rice..pretty good- it's one of their more popular items but I was starting to get full at this point. My husband ordered the lamb pot stickers and whoa,  I thought they were amaze-balls. He was wanting a dipping sauce for them but I didn't think it needed it. The crispy lace design was gorgeous! My husband also got the brisket taco and the dan dan noodles. Great service!",

The service is fair and the food was a disappointment. We had the Mexican options...various street tacos. They were a) pricey for small street tacos; b) the chicken was just maybe cooked, with some pieces bordering raw. I had to spit out two pieces of under cooked meat; c) a beer and simple Corona and Diet Coke cost $13. You are paying here for location and the brand name of a famous chef. The only redeeming thing was the great salsa.",

    "text": "Another small plates casual restaurant by Chef Jose Andres at the Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas. We were so hungry, we only saw this restaurant open for lunch a bit earlier. It's Chinese and Mexican small plates.   A solid 2.5 star, one goes to the service, one goes to the Tsingtao beer (Chinese beer) they serve, and a very authentic Chinese hot sauce they serve, half star goes to the decor.   Total lunch bill for 2 , 1 beer: $70, ( really a lot for the tiny portions)  A brunch menu and regular menu, we ordered something from both menus.  Chinese noodle soup with eggs, pork and veggies., it's one of the bigger portion choices on the menu, it was meant for sharing, it tasted very very bad, we didn't know what kind of food was that.... Definitely not Chinese!   Traditional ShuMai: 6 tiny pieces with some gold stuffs on top of each one. They looked fancy but tasted disgusting.....I think they dipped all of those in soy sauce and dried them up....Extremely salty....  Chicken Ji song: 4 tiny chicken lettuce wraps with fried potatoes on the top, they were OK   Mexican grilled chicken taco: I don't think I have ever had a taco that tasted so bad, most disgusting flavor ever! They put some sort of salty Chinese sauce or paste with green onions on top, those things just don't mix! Think chef confused it with a traditional Chinese wrap dish.   If we weren't super hungry, I don't think we could have had even swallowed the food, they were soooo bad! Honestly it's a shame to a celebrity chef, Jose should've just sticked to Spanish tapas, forget about Chinese and Mexican food! I think this 2 kinds of food are the more original the better, don't play with them.....  Worst food we'v ever had, but the service was great! Our waitress was super attentive and friendly. The decor is so cute, very trendy, the pictures on the wall change every few minutes, it was fun to look at them.   I am pretty sure we weren't the only ones who hated the food. Saw some ppl sat down n looked at the menu for 5 minutes and left! Smart.... Just saying..... Will never go back !!!",

As we were ready to leave, the manager came up with more excuses. However, he took us to table. Magically, there were 2 - 4 tops open. More excuses.

The guac was fresh and well seasoned, and the margaritas come with a sea salt foam that is delightful. The taco selection is strong, with juicy pork and beef.

My first experience with their food left me questioning how they can get away with these outrageously high prices and the food being just average.   This time around we opted out of ordering tacos as I get way better tacos at Tacos El Gordo for half the price. I was craving soup so we ordered posole as a starter as well as chips & salsa, chicken flautas, 20 vegetable fried rice, and dan dan noodles. The posole was salty and the soup thick. I had to ask for more lime to offset the saltiness. The vegetable fried rice is good but not at $19.   I don't think I can see myself coming back unless there is nothing else available if I'm staying at the Cosmopolitan.",

To start with, I always order a drink with Tuna Ceviche. I have eaten Scallop Ceviche, but tuna is way better than scallops, I think.  I would recommend the Chinese inspired taco, Viva China. They are very tasty. Fish taco was really good, too.  For dim sum, I recommend \"when pigs fly\", its a BBQ pork buns. Delicious (its a bit sweet side, tho).  All the sui mai is very good. Gold leaf on Sui Mai??? Funny but they are good.  However, noodles in the lower price range, Kao Lao Lao and Dan Dan Mian are my least favorite. The taste is flat - too greasy and boring. I dont recommend. I guess you get what you pay for.   Soup,,, they are OK.  Bartender was super nice and explained everything I asked.",

The Viva China (oysters + soft beef tendon+ peppercorn sauce) taco was quite tasty as was the Huitlacoche noodles with mushrooms and Mexican corn truffles. The best cold dish has to be the Palmitos (hearts of palm + grapefruit salad) which was ideal to combat the Vegas heat.   No matter what the server suggests, the shrimp mojo (shrimp + fermented garlic sauce) is not worth it for the tiny bits of shrimp. It's something a Chinese mama could make for a lot less.   Drinks were amazing; Mexican mojitos, mimosas and what have you. They do magic with Mezcal here!  For what it is, this resto does solid lunch and dinners, and the drinks aren't too bad. Drop in if you're stuck outside Marquee or just for a quick bite before checking into your room.",

Good thing, because had I trusted Yelp's 3-star review, I might have missed out on a memorable meal.  Trendy and quirky beyond belief, this restaurant exudes cool (or hipster, depending on your view, but I took it as cool).  It has booths and community tables, and the dishes are all small plates from Mexican and Chinese cuisine... not much fusion, but it's nice to mix and match.  My wife and I shared chips and salsa, with hot, fresh chips and a smoky chipotle salsa with just the right amount of kick.  I got a carnitas taco, which was succulent and had homemade pork rinds on top.  My wife liked her barbacoa taco as well.  For our \"main courses\" (although remember, it's small plates, so that doesn't really apply), I had the lemon tree shrimp, which was unbelievably good.  The shrimp tasted fresh, and the sauce was redolent with black pepper and celery, and the occasional chunk of citrus fruit.  My wife had the Beijing glass, a noodle dish that was not to my taste, but it looked beautiful, with all the components (noodles and tons of different Asian veggies) sectioned out in the bowl, waiting to be mixed.  She loved it.  Some people are complaining about the size of the dishes.  Well, it's small plates, and you're supposed to order 2-3 items.  The wait staff tells you that.  Our waitress even asked us during lunch if we were satisfied with the amount of food we had ordered -- and we were.  Far too many restaurants go for quantity over quality, but China Poblano serves properly sized meals.  Two or three dishes really should be enough to fill up one person.  If not, I dunno, go to one of the millions of buffets on the Strip instead.  If I'm going to spend $30 on a meal, I'd honestly rather have high-quality food than \"all-you-can-eat.\"",

    "text": "Part II ; Cosmo Food Crawl  CHINA POBLANO  Working ourselves from light to medium on heaviness, we ventured to what is another Jose Andres restaurant, China Poblano- a Chinese Mexican (not fused) cuisine that confuses and delights at the same time.  It's definitely a split personality (akin to that psycho you may have dated at one point....) but if you go for the ride, you may be pleasantly surprised.  I tend to favor more of the Chinese cuisine, and their appetizer/dim sum selections is quite addictive and a perfect fit to our second leg of the Food Crawl...           The interior decor is an attack on the senses, an onslaught of hyperbolic technicolor thrown together miss mosh, like graphics on an side street in Tokyo...chaotic.  And with two unseeingly mismatched cuisines housed under one roof, so is the the decor; the room is bifurcated down the middle, Mexican on one side, Chinese on the other (a modern West Side Story? Jets and Shark Fins?)  As for drinks, we started with a Cantelope Agua Fresca; this beverage is naturally sweet and just the right amount of nectar and water, no sugar comas or bouncing off of walls like the Tasmanian Devil on a pogo stick.  An alter.....to what? it's so friction strange, I dunno, do you sit here, or pray....? but the food's good, so I let this one pass...  As I'm partial to the Chinese Dim Sum offerings at CP, the Har Gau: Shrimp, Pork Belly and Shitake Mushrooms wrapped in a translucent skin and steamed, creating the perfect little bite.  Devouring every piece, I love to add Soy and Chili Sauce to punch it up till it's over the top with flavor.  This dish my favorite: Lamb Potstickers 'Stuck on You': six dumplings connected together with a crispy lace-from a visual standpoint, it's so delicate and fragile as you break off a piece, but it's another story when you put it in your mouth.  The dumplings are fried pouches full of unctuous lamb meat, full of juice and fat it bursts in your mouth, the cumin is just a powerhouse of spice, making it a hearty dish.",

We had some good things, we had some bad things.  All in all, I would have been happier with take-out chow mein and a random street taco.",

    "text": "Located in the Cosmopolitan is a bright great ambiance restaurant. Mexican and Chinese served together, tapas style . Earlier in the day i saw them making everything from scratch before the restaurant was open.   Perfect for a group so you can taste a little bit of everything. Service is great we had our water up to the top the entire time. There is a good selection on the menu so it's hard to decide what to try. We started with the chips with salsa. Chips have a great seasoning on them and the salsa was a chipotle type. (both delicious.) I ordered the Golden Pigs it comes four pieces and is a soft bread with bbq pork inside served with a side of condensed milk to dip it in.  Sounds odd but the mix is delicious, we had the cochinita taco and the chorizo fundido which comes with fresh tortillas The Quesidilla Chicarron was good too.  My one complaint would be the imported coca cola from Mexica at 5.88 in original bottle.  All and all it was a great experience with delicious food and great service.",

We arrived in a group of 10 and shared a lot of food. Every time I took a bite, I instantly thought of some place where the dish is so much better. $6 taco? Even the $1.50 ones from the taco truck from the ghetto are so much better. The noodle dishes are an embarrassment to the Chinese. Save your money!!",

One night my girl friends got take out after a long day of partying but her sister is a foodie so the fact she said her Seafood noodle dish didn't have lobster and it's $50 and then  said her food was  not  good, I became  worried because I was really excited about eating there. So Saturday after a long day at A Cedric Gervais pool party, hungover and starving we went to eat here and the food was not good at all. It was salty it tasted like MSG and I felt sick after my meal. I wouldn't be too excited to eat here again . Sooooo Disappointed :/",

    "text": "While I really enjoyed the ambience of China Poblano, and the love the idea of a restaurant like this, the food was really hit or miss.  Tuna Ceviche: Outstanding! The unexpected touch was the amaranth seeds, which contributed a wonderful crunch that made this dish memorable. It was so tasty and refreshing that we contemplated a second order.  Chilaquiles: These were not the casserole-style chilaquiles I am used to, but it was a welcome difference. They more closely resembled nachos, but were among the best nachos I have had in recent memory.  Twenty Vegetable Fried Rice: My opinion of this rice might be different if this dish didn't cost $20. I understand that it costs a restaurant a fair amount to obtain that many different vegetables, and I certainly don't mind paying for that...but this dish just had no punch! Many of the vegetables were indistinguishable from one another, and the dominant taste was soy sauce. It was beautiful to look at, but that's the best I can say. I much prefer the $6 fried rice I can get at my favorite sushi place back home.  Tacos: The tacos, unfortunately, were a miss. The chicharron didn't bring anything to the party on my Cochinita taco, and I didn't care for the aftertaste either.  Bottom line -- China Poblano is worth a visit for the ambience and certain dishes, but you can definitely skip the tacos. I'm certainly looking forward to going back to try some of the Asian dishes.",

I love Chinese and Mexican food and this place brought out some great flavors from both nations. Pot stickers, dumplings, an awesome fried rice dish and a very tender Mongolian beef were complimented by tacos, guacamole..you get the idea. The hostesses graciously seated us right away on a packed night and the view from the casino/patio was outstanding. Not outrageously expensive either like most casino restaurants so overall a great choice in the Cosmo.",

The waiter was very attentive and friend as well . The menu is a bit Strange mixing Mexican  cuisine And Chinese but it was a nice twist to let us each try a differ choice without having to go to a buffet. We ordered the recommend Chicken Ji Song (4pc. Lettuce leaf cups / fried sweet potatoes 16.88) is was very good no over powering flavored but very tasteful !! We also ordered the Fish Ceviche which was also very good it had a bed of guacamole on the bottom and the fish on top , it also had a nice flavorful kick to it as well . I'm not a spicy kind of person but I was able to eat enough to enjoy the meal . The also had a good beer selection which we ordered the Westmalle Trappist Ale, never tried it before but it was delicious.",

Salsa was different and smoky, tacos were excellent (esp brisket), Chinese street sandwich was great. Only complaints: 1) server warned us about how spicy some dishes were, but they were barely spicy (and I'm not one who eats spicy stuff normally) and 2) wings were good, but underwhelming compared to rest of meal. Server was good anti explaining menu otherwise. Server assistants and other staff were excellent, prompt, attentive, friendly.  If back in Vegas, I'll stop here again.",
