    "text": "My wife and I used to go quite a bit before we started having children.  The mom and pop who used to run Buon Gusto before were awesome.  A True mom and pop joint.  About two years ago we dined there and we could tell it was under new ownership.  There was an older gentleman waiting tables.  He told us he bought the restaurant from the mom and pop and his son, a culinary school graduate, would be running the business.  Fast forward two years.  We ordered some to go food.  Chicken trieste, lasagna, and children's chicken strips.  They said it would take 40 minutes.  When I showed up the reatuarant had only two people dining.  There were 5 people working and goofing off.  The hot food had been made, who knows how long it was sitting there.  The man working the front then went and made the salads.  When they were wrapping up the food I asked if the pasta side was in the bag.  He said no, would you like it? I sure would because it says on the menu the chicken trieste comes with a side of pasta and red sauce.  The man working the front went and told, who I believe to be the son chef.  At that point, the chef brought out an attitude.  I got our food, took it home and we are it.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't the Buon Gusto we were used to.  The service sucked, and the restaurant was empty.    It is easy to see the new owners have no clue about customer service.  This place will be closed or under new ownership in a year.  It's too bad because it used to be so good.  Well, not anymore.",

    "text": "Meh. Service was fantastic but food didn't deliver like we hoped it would. The decor and atmosphere is very East Coast. The menu prices, for a homey pizza joint, do not reflect the quality of ingredients in anything. Pizza has a dry cracker crust (bleh) and toppings are of mediocre quality. For a small (9\") pizza, toppings should not be $1.50 each and if they need to be that expensive, they need to shine. This is not True. Pepperoni is tiny and not that great. Also, pizza cheese is average, bland and not much flavor. Pasta dish prices are a bit high; most baked pasta dishes range from $13-15 and that's way too high for pre-cooked pasta to simply get smothered in pre-made sauce and cheese and thrown under a broiler for 10 minutes. Unless it's enough to feed two people, that's a high price but if it tastes great...this wasn't the case though. What I suggest is that quality of ingredients steps up a notch, the theme and style of this place is awesome but the menu needs to reflect what it's going for. Good sauce, good cheese, good-to-go!",

    "text": "A few friends were surprised to find such good reviews for a restaurant in this curious location, in a strip mall on the border of a bunch of commercial offices and cookie-cutter residential developments, so I decided to tag along with them. After visiting, we're now only surprised that it got good reviews.  Our experience was very much Jekyll and Hyde. The food was either really good (artichoke appetizer, sausage and mushroom rigatoni, clam linguini) or very disappointing (fried ravioli way overdone, lasagna pasta mushy and falling apart, veal parmesan so smothered in sauce that the breading just fell off).   Same with service:  All the staff were friendly, but service was excessively slow. Slow to get seated, slow for waiters to acknowledge us, slow for food to get out, and slow to get refills and the check. I hate ragging on friendly servers, but when the service is this slow, it's bad service even if they're friendly.  It does not help that value proposition was suspect. Dishes are not large to begin with, plus they give a lot of pasta and sauce but seem stingy on the meat and stuff that matters.  Almost forgot - wine list is very disappointing, but they offer cheap corkage, so bring your own if you insist on coming here. But I'd just as soon recommend to go elsewhere. There are a lot of better Italian options - even in the close-by areas.",

    "text": "So we found this place on Yelp! (where else?!) while searching for a good Italian restaurant in the Southwest/Henderson area. Walking into this place was just like walking into my grandma's kitchen... this place was full of yummy aromas, simple decor and small dining tables that made it all a very inviting little place.  You can tell this place is family-owned and it shows in their friendly (and awesome), yet informal service. Upon sitting down you are greeted by a big smile, a basket of warm home-made bread and a mixture of herbs and virgin olive oil-- which you can refill as many times as you'd like. By the way, the bread they serve is pretty much the BEST bread you will try in Vegas.  We all ordered different dishes to try: Sausage mushroom rigatoni, penne all a vodka and linguini del mar and they were all amazing. You can taste the dedication and fresh ingredients put into every dish and will rejoice in the huge portions the will serve you! Now, while all the different dishes we ordered were awesome, I would recommend the Linguini del Mar as it is the tastiest of them all.  Do yourself a favor and come visit this place. Your tastebuds will thank you for it!",

(In my eyes and taste buds at least).  Gave this place a second chance after my first experience was not great. This time I ordered the most basic; pepperoni pizza. Sadly, once again they could not compensate for my first bad experience. My pizza was hard, almost burnt and tasteless. Customer service was also just as bad as the first time, except last time it was a busy night, this time there were only 2 tables being served. Waitress was missing in action for the majority of the time. She seemed very inattentive of our table needs and to top this all off, our pizza was $23 (without tax.)   Not worth the price, will not be coming back.",

After a place I wanted to try was closed, I fired up the Yelp app and it took us to Buon Gusto.   I do not live on the side of town where Buon Gusto is, so I have never heard of it. I would also rather go to a family run place (which Vegas lacks) than a chain so off we went.  All we could say, is excellent. These place is a small restaurant in a shopping center, very nondescript. Once we walked in, we were immediately greeted and offered any seat. Drinks were offered right away and we went right to ordering.   I had the baked ziti with meatball and my girlfriend had the chicken milanese (sp?). Before the entrees came out, we had warm bread brought over and a small salad, which was definitely the best side salad I've had in awhile. Once the entrees came, WOW. True home cooked Italian dishes which we quickly went to work on, with enough for leftovers. I normally dont like leftovers, but the food was so good I took it home and ended up eating it later.   I will definitely be back to this spot when I am in the area and cant wait!",

I called in an order to go at 3:55 pm and was told it would be ready in 45 minutes.  I arrived on time and no one there could find a record of the order until the waitress that had taken it over the phone said yes she remembered it, but that they had gotten busy and that's why it wasn't ready.  She said it would \"just be 6 minutes to make it\" (a well done pizza and spaghetti & meatballs).  While I don't know much about cooking, even I knew that wasn't a realistic time.  And, if it truly would only take \"6 minutes\" to make, why did she tell me \"45 minutes\" in the first place?  But, worse than that was her attitude, which I would describe as indifferent or apathetic: she had no problem with accepting the order and giving her word that it would be ready and waiting for me, and then just blowing it off when I arrived.    Maybe I caught the staff there on an \"off day\".  Be that as it may, I'd suggest that if you order food to go from Buon Gusto, you get a firm commitment on their intentions to follow thru on it.",

    "text": "I was in town to run a half marathon and I was looking for a local pasta place.  I checked Yelp and found Buon Gusto.  The ratings were great so decided to give it a try.  I can honestly say, it was worth the trip.  The place is really small and certainly local.  We arrived early (4:00 pm) since we had a show to catch, but I knew I needed to eat prior to the show.  The restaurant was already getting busy even at this time of day.  We were a group of 5 so we were seated at one of the 2 larger tables.  The waitress was really friendly and helpful.  The food was amazing. The portions were ok, I would truly recommend the side portion dishes as they appeared to be almost the same size as the full portions but they are way cheaper.  The only thing I did not cared for was that we had to keep asking for more bread ( which the bread is awesome and could not get enough of it :) so we asked for additional bread since we were 5 adults and the bread is not large.  But once we asked we got more bread, so it was ok.  Overall, the food maybe a bit more expensive than a chain Italian place, but I rather pay a little more for a small local business that the food is good.  Not to mention, they serve Coca cola products, which is awesome.  Many restaurants in the area serve Pepsi, it is just not the same to have a \"Pepsi and rum\"...",

You're greeted with warm smiles from the minute you walk in, at every moment during the meal, and on your way out.   The place has that whole in the wall feel to if. Nicely decorated and great oldies music playing.  Might I recommend the pineapple pizza? It was exquisite! Sometimes I get the chilly cheesesteak which puts firehouse subs to shame :)",

He brought our drinks (glass of house merlot $7.95). We then had salad and bread which were good.  I ordered pasta with chicken and broccoli (not much flavor), my husband ordered a personal pizza. It took about 40 minutes before we got our meal and the waiter said that only the sauce was a little burned, however the bottom was black. We told the waiter that it was terrible after taking 1 bite. The waiter said he could bring a slice of sausage  pizza which took another 10 minutes it came overdone but not burned. The waiter apologized and said he would give us back the coupon and adjust the bill. When the bill arrived it was $1 more than it would have been if we would had received the meal we had ordered. Certainly will not be going here again even with coupon.",

    "text": "My friends offered to take me out for dinner for my birthday.  Based on the reviews for Buon Gusto, I chose this restaurant.  My husband was surprised, considering I could choose anything, even a casino steakhouse. But I love the idea of finding a \"hidden jem\", so I thought, okay if I'm wrong, it's my choice, it's my birthday.   Buon Gusto was everything the reviews have said and more.  The pizza actually made me tear up because it was so much like the pizza I had in New York when I was little and my mom took me there to visit my grandparents in Brooklyn and I haven't had anything like that since.  The salad was so fresh, the dressing perfect. Bread with a light crunchy crust, cloud soft inside.  We don't eat a lot of food at a time anymore, so the four of us split an antipasto, a medium cheese pizza and ala carte portions of rigatoni with sausage and Fettuchini Alfredo (okay, so I'm not a perfect speller).  All excellent, excellent, excellent. In Hawaii, we have a saying \"Sit long and talk much\".  That is just what we did -- it was less busy than we feared, maybe because it was a Thursday, but we got there at 6:30 and were seated almost immediately.  The atmosphere is so comfortable and welcoming, it really is like you are visiting an Italian family in their home.  They make everything right in front of you, well-timed service and as heartfelt as it comes. All the staff connected with us at one time or another, in a genuine way. Smiles. Drink refills without asking.  I mean, how much better does hospitality get? You don't have to dress up, you don't have to spend mucho bucks -- I really didn't think places like this existed anymore. Go for excellent food, comfortable atmosphere, great people. The only reason why I gave it five stars is because you can't give them more! Such a nice birthday surprise! (and I got to be right, can't beat that!)",

Fresh bread came out first with great garlic & olive oil for dipping followed by house salad, both excellent.  We wanted the Italian Wedding soup of the day but they had just taken a large take-out order that wiped today's batch out.  We had: 1) Calamari:  very good but we've been spoiled by better.  Their marinara was the bomb.  Solid choice in any event.  Probably would try something else as an appetizer next time.  2) Veal Picatta:  Excellent prep.  We were told by owner that they don't even pound the veal cutlets flat until we order.  Everything made fresh and flavors prove this.  Knowing this I'll try the Veal Parmesan next time just to get more marinara.  3)  Cattleman's (all meat) Pizza:  Good choice.  Nice crust and good flavors on toppings.  Would do that one again.",

    "text": "I finally have gotten around to writing a review for this place.  I love it here.  It's a very east coast, non-corporate type of place.  When someone wants to go out to eat and are visiting my at my place, I take them here.  At first, I was addicted to the Sicilian eggplant then I tried the sausage and mushroom rigatoni.  I don't think I've gotten anything else since.  This is so much so that when I stumbled in there yesterday evening, Steve says, \"You look like you woke up this morning and wanted the rigatoni.\"  The man knows me too well.  Normally, I get the salad (which is excellent), but this past time I decided to try the Italian wedding soup.  Not bad.  The artichoke appetizer was great as well as Cabernet. I think I've eaten the entire loaf of bread with the garlic, olive oil, and vinegar every time I've gone in there. While it may not be my favorite cannoli in Vegas, it still is pretty good.  Actually, everything I've had here is good.  I've had a few people ask me what is the restaurant that I go to the most-- this is it.  Is this the best restaurant in Vegas? No.  Is this my favorite restaurant in Vegas? Yes. There is just something about this place that feels like home.  That in itself is a feat not to be scoffed at.",

I hadn't been to Buon Gusto for a while so when I was in the area, I decided to go get some of my favorite pizza to go.  What a surprise when I get home and open the box to find a pizza that looks nothing like I remember. The pizza was burnt in some places and looked undercooked in others. Unfortunately,  the taste was off too.   I took one bite and went to my pantry to make it a cereal night. To be honest, I just wanted the old pizza. This was a disappointment all around.  I guess they have new owners. I wish I had read Yelp before ordering. So, here is your takeaway from my review: If you LOVED something in the past, check Yelp before going as you may just be disappointed if you don't.",

Expect to wait if you visit Buon Gusto during peek business hours. Buon is a small and very popular restaurant; the food, service, and charm are exceptional.  I had the clam chowder soup to start my meal and that was a perfect amount of food to hold me over until the eggplant parma appetizer. The eggplant parm is made with garlic, pancetta, and sherry wine. It was great! Honestly, I might try it next time as my entree.  Have you ever had pumpkin lasagna? For my entree, the chef had created a lasagna experiment. One of the owners sold me on the lasagna with a pumpkin sauce. If expecting a red meaty sauce, you might have been disappointed. However, I was forewarned about the substitute and details of the creation. I tend to enjoy trying new and different cooking creations, so I was excited to try pumpkin lasagna. The owner's enthusiasm sold me. His description was spot on. I really enjoyed the off menu creation. You'll have to beg the chef to recreate this pumpkin sauce next season.   All meals are served with warm bread and soft butter. The restaurant is clean and the decor includes checkered tablecloths and hanging grades, garlic, and peppers. You'll see jars of peppers and pasta - and of course no Italian restaurant would be complete without the \"Buon Appetite\" prominently displayed. I will definitely visit again next time I am in Henderson.",

    "text": "I came here twice in the past month with friends locally and then some really authentic friends from New York.  Here is my dealio.  a. 5 Star - The chef / owner comes out to talk with you.  Love it!  Very cool.  b.  3 Star - Food - Pretty darn good. I had the Shrimp Fradiavolo and you know what, it was okay. I am not sure if it was the small shrimp size or the small quantity of shrimp, it was just okay.  Came back a few days later and had the Linguine Del Mar. I liked this dish much more.  The noodles were just right, al dente.  The seafood was very tasty and tender. Again, they don' tout much in your dish, but this was a very tasty, tender dish.  c.  Aw Shucks - My friends from New York are both Italian and I have eaten many italian dishes in New York / Long Island.  They drove here from the strip because I was remembering Buon Gusto from the old days and all I can say was, they were really not I guess, \"whelmed\"  .  Is that even a word?  They were not overwhelmed or underwhelmed.   d.  Service - The week  before the service I had was really great!  The wine was good, the bantering was great and our experience was just right.  This last time, I am not sure how well trained the waiter was, but he got an order wrong, and so two of us started eating our hot dish and the third one came out so late we were done eating and watched her.  I found that odd at best. There was no accommodation, they charged us for everything, but the experience with two people eating , one person waiting and then the other eating after the first two are done, is just plain dopey.  e.  Coffee - Now any great italian food needs to be followed by coffee.  I wanted an espresso and they had a Kuerig machine with the cartridges. My colleague asked for a cappuccino and that was when we learned about the Kuerig.  I was going to ask for an espresso, but I decided not too. I do wonder if they have a proper coffee machine or not, but at this point, after waiting for the food like we did, I did not want to linger any longer.  I really enjoy supporting locally owned restaurants.  I like the atmosphere, the family feeling, the great decor, the nice people.  I will definitely be coming back.  Just not a five star situation at this time based on my last two visits within one week of each other.",

We arrived about 5:30 and it was starting to fill up, by 6 all the tables were full.   We started off with the artichokes italiano. Sauteed artichokes with pancetta, wine and garlic. I really liked this dish, and served with warm bread it was very good. For our entrees our waiter recommended the sausage and mushroom rigatoni which came with a house salad. After waiting about 15-20 minutes the salads arrived. Very small and bland. Just a little bit of lettuce, 2 pieces of tomato and a couple slices of small olives. The blue cheese dressing was bland.   After another 15 minutes or so the entrees arrived. It was just OK. The rigatoni was well cooked and the tomato cream sauce was pretty good, nothing great though. I didn't care for the sausage at all. It was like sliced links and not ground sausage, and there wasn't that much in the dish.   I would like to return during the week and  give them another try. Our waiter was very nice, although the service was terribly slow. Again my quest for great Italian food will continue on!",

It can take a little longer on a Friday night due to the size of the oven, but order a glass of nicely priced wine, settle in, and enjoy the warm bread and delicious olive oil.  Good things take time :)",

It was about 1/3 full with a nice relaxing atmosphere and good service. It would be a good place to have a business lunch or romantic dinner. Owner and chef Kimberly really seems to care about her customers. The back room/bar area is a nice place for a larger group. Really enjoyed my lunch there.",

Also the portions are huge. They both came with salad before the meal and a basket of bread. I loved the bread!! Our server was very friendly and accommodating. I really liked that the restaurant is a little hole In the wall. It was later so it wasn't really busy I actually liked that we practically had the restaurant to ourselves. Will be back soon!!!",

It can get busy, but we only had to wait maybe 10 minutes for a table to free up.  The staff were very polite, friendly, and attentive. Our waters were never empty, we were checked on numerous times, etc.  It's a pizza, pasta, and other Italian fare restaurant (duh). I was quite excited to see penne alla vodka on their menu (a serious fav of fine). They also have some delicious sounding raviolis and other pasta items. Everything we ordered was great and delicious. Portions are good - not overwhelmingly large, but you might walk out with leftovers. And most everything comes with a soup or salad. Neither are anything particularly good or fancy, but they get the drop down. The bread and olive oil garlic dip is delicious.  They have a small drink menu with at least one of most types of popular wines and some bottled beers. It's nothing to write home about, but it's enough to compliment your meal.  All in all, a very pleasant meal was had here. We were well taken care of. The food was yummy. And everything was decently priced. So yay! I've found a new neighborhood restaurant.",

I had the chicken parmesan Not only was it absolutely delicious!! the chicken was perfectly cooked!! the sauce was amazing! and the portion was so big I had leftovers for 2 days afterwards!   Most of the entrees come with salad and that's not your run-of-the-mill salad it is a nice salad with your choice of garlic Ranch homemade dressing or a wine-based balsamic dressing.. I tried them both and they were phenomenal!  You're also served a full loaf of sourdough bread and the best oil vinegar balsamic dressing to dip it in I've ever had!!   I also tried the tiramisu for dessert and I normally don't like tiramisu very much, it was absolutely one of the best desserts I've ever had!!   What a great find I can't wait to go back again and try something else and to bring all my friends there!!",

He said if we wanted it, we had to wait about 20 minutes for it. We ordered the pasta vodka and the pasta with olive oil and garlic instead. The pasta vodka was pretty good but the olive oil and garlic was extremely dry. We also ordered the Brushetta and that was not your normal Brushetta you would find at an Italian restaurant. It was on a piece of toasted breaded but covered in melted cheese and oil...not good. Probably wouldn't go there again.",

This time my party of four initially had a long wait for water and butter, but service was otherwise first rate.  Veal Marsala with mushrooms and Marsala Wine Sauce yielded a fine veal entree, except our server reported that the kitchen ran out of veal after fulfilling one order.  So Diane sacrificed, and ordered a different dish.    Chicken Fricasse was a very good soup of the day, paired with fresh Italian Bread.  A Caesar Salad tasted good.  And Spaghetti with Bolognese Sauce and Mushrooms came out fine.  No aioli was available, so we did not order Calamari Fritti this time.  Chocolate and Pistachio Gelati were very good but the Salted Caramel Gelato tasted saltier than I would have preferred.  A special advertised Yelp check in discount of 50% off a second entree was graciously honored on the spot.",

Crab cakes were horrid; deep fried to resemble oily hockey pucks and for 18$, expected a bit better than freezer to fryer. Wine helped.  Chef/new owner stopped by table to ask how food was and gave honest opinion that crab cakes usually not deep fried, particularly Italian style. Chef said that he could not change the recipe as he has so many regulars. I would question the palettes of that demographic. He asked where i was from originally and when advised from east coast he responded that east coasters are too picky about seafood. Eh?   He is young and in need of serious guidance on customer relations, Italian cuisine, freshness, and interior design. Maybe a visit back east is what he may need?  Am giving it two stars as our server was quite friendly and helpful.",

Good sign- We went there at 8.30 p.m. on monday night and there were quite a few people eating there!  The server brought some really warm bread and an amazing olive oil, olive and garlic dip with balsamic vinegar. We thought about just having one slice each but ended up eating the whole bread!  I ordered portabella mushroom ravioli in a red pepper sauce. This was divine. The red pepper sauce was a rich, cheesy sauce with a great red pepper taste. The ravioli was almost melting in my mouth.. D ordered a vegetarian pizza which had a generous helping of cheese, artichokes, olives, and roasted eggplant on a thin crust pizza base. Excellent again.  Everything seemed to be freshly prepared and of great quality.  HIghly recommended!",

My parents favorite meal is the veal parmesan, but I love their penne pasta in vodka sauce. My husband loves their baked ziti with sausage. My kids really like their pizza, however they never finish their meal because they eat so much of the bread they serve. We are from New Jersey so it's nice to have a good Italian meal that tastes like back home at really great prices.  One last thank you to the owner and Kimmy you always make us feel so welcomed!!",

The in-laws had heard of a local place with a good reputation but couldn't remember the name.  A quick search on Yelp narrowed our search down to Buon Gusto. It was the perfect find!   They have a small dining area and take out service.  We opted for dine-in.  A little cramped for our party of 5 but the atmosphere is pleasant and service was friendly and helpful.   The food was fantastic.  The sauces have a great homemade taste and the pasta was cooked very well.   My salad was super fresh and crisp and the house dressing - balsamic vinaigrette -- was lovely.  The star of the table was the Chef Cisco Style Eggplant entree.  A must try.  Sliced eggplant tossed in a marinara rosemary sauce, smothered in cheese and baked.  So amazingly tasty. The other dishes were very good as well.  The one disappointment was the wine by the glass selection.  Very limited and what they had was not good quality. Overall I highly recommend a visit to Buon Gusto.",

Plenty of mushrooms too.  -Tiramisu: I ate the whole piece. By myself. Enough said. (super light and airy with a hint of alcohol. A perfect way to end the meal)  Lower-lights: -Calamari: They were good and not too oily except that I feel they kind of lacked flavor. They needed a lot of salt and could have used some seasoning. Even with the marinara sauce it was a little bland.  -Veal Parmigana: A little pricey ($25) but it was a large portion. It was so completely drenched with sauce and cheese that you couldn't really taste anything except tomato sauce. And the breading on the veal just slid right off. Too soggy of a dish for me.   Overall: super friendly staff and wonderful homemade tasting meal. I definitely want to come back and try some other delicious plates on their menu.",

    "text": "My good friend grew up in New York City, and Buon Gusto is one of her favorite place to eat in Las Vegas. It didn't take much arm-twisting for her to convince me to try it out for dinner on a recent Friday evening.   The owners hail from Brooklyn and serve up excellent food at fair prices. It's a smaller restaurant, complete with memorabilia from NYC all over the walls. When we arrived it was packed with another party waiting to be seated. Sandi, one of the owners, was working as the hostess and she was great. Not only did she give us a pretty accurate idea of how long we would be waiting, she also came over to let us know when the party seated at the table we were going to be sitting at was done eating.   Our waitress took our drink order and brought out some complementary warm bread and oil to dip it in. We had my friend's two children with her that were starving, so she ordered food for them while I continued to look over the menu. When their slices of pizza were ready, the other owner, Steve, brought them out to our table.  I ended up ordering the spaghetti and meatballs, my friend had the eggplant parmigiana, NY style. I was given the option to switch to whole wheat or gluten free pasta for an additional charge, I didn't do it but like that it was an option. Both entrees came with choice of soup or salad, I chose the salad with house dressing (made in house as all house dressings should be) and she had the soup which was Italian wedding soup. Both of these came out very quickly. The salad wasn't anything to write home about but it the veggies were fresh.   We waited close to an hour from the time we ordered for our entrees to come out. Our waitress was very apologetic, which we appreciated, but she made the mistake of telling us our food should be out in \"4 minutes\" ( not \"a few minutes\" which would have made more sense) which of course did not happen.   In the end, the food was worth the wait. The meatballs were excellent, and the portion was massive. I would go back in a heartbeat, just going to make sure I don't have anywhere to be immediately afterward...",

I love love love their house dressing (Italian type vinaigrette), and the chunk of bread you get with every meal.  We have yet to dine in, as we tend to do a lot of take-out for our date nights while the kids are in bed, but I have no reason to believe it would do anything but improve our opinion of the place!  It's my current favorite Italian place in Vegas/Henderson.",

Now we come here everytime she visits, truly the place to be. This is real home Italian cooking at its finest. I highly recommend!",

I am a really picky Eater from NY and feel I assess Italian food pretty well :) I was disappointed in my meal here.  I ordered the baked ravioli with extra sauce , it cam with a sub par salad that I did not like at all and did not really have extra sauce.  The sauce reminded me of Ragu or Delmonte from a can.  I know that it was made there but it was not very good.  I got a slice of pizza for my daughter which was decent.  I would go back for a slice but there definitely is better pizza around here such as Verranzos on Windmill/Eastern and Grimaldi's on Eastern.  I wouldn't return to this restaurant except for a quick slice if I was in the shopping center.",

    "text": "First, let me preface this review with some background.  I married a wonderful Italian woman who loves to tell stories of growing up in Denver and visiting the checkered tablecloth and candle restaurants of that city, especially the one owned by her uncle.  When we first entered and sat down, I saw her looking around and getting a little misty-eyed with nostalgia.    The menu did not disappoint either.  This is not a trendy joint with dishes prepared in the latest fashion.  This is the simple, home-cooked staples of an Italian family: gnocci, pasta with sauce (which the waiter refered to as \"gravy\", always a good sign), and a pizza take-out service that was hopping the entire time we were there. My wife ordered the gnocci, and after sampling the dish, shoved one in my mouth saying \"That's what a gnocci should taste like!\"  Don't expect fancy, but do expect great traditional Italian food served with a minimum of fluff and fancy.  My wife and I have made two trips back (30+ miles each way) since our first visit, and both visits have affirmed our first impressions.  Take the time to check this place out.  I don't think you will regret it!",

Our server forgot to bring our soup before bringing our main courses, so he asked if it was ok to bring it to go.  We said yes because our other food was there, but it wasn't really a good solution overall.  At least he could have given us a little bigger amount given the mistake, but we still got just the small cupfuls.  We split a large caesar salad.  It was plain - no shredded parmesan or asiago, just romaine, dressing, and croutons i think (obviously not memorable).  I can't recall what  my husband ate but I had something with the red pepper sauce that is supposed to be one of their signature dishes.  It was just ok.  The ambiance is friendly and homey - vinyl checkered tablecloths.  The prices aren't too bad but I don't think they should be any higher for this sort of place.  I was really looking forward to trying Buon Gusto, which had been recommended to us and was sad to have been disappointed.  Probably won't end up back there as there are a lot of alternatives (Pasta Shop, Ventano's, Gaetano's all nicer, Montesano's seemed like a better deal for the money with similar ambiance).",

All you need is a dedicated mom-and pop style of management, a good understanding of traditional cooking and service with a smile. These things can be found at Buon Gusto.  I had the pleasure of dining here on valentines day with my girlfriend. It was, not surprisingly, quite packed. We were seated fairly soon by a friendly hostess. The place is tiny and quaint--- a decidedly humble little establishment with traditional Italian themed decorations lining the walls. It's nothing too fancy but a real fan could care less about the lack of extravagance--- its clean and well maintained.   The bread was delicious-- better than I've had at Annie's Gourmet, and about as good as I had at Ventano's. The salads were excellent-- the best I've ever had at an Italian restaurant. They didn't skimp on the olives and the home made balsamic vinaigrette will be the best you've ever tasted. They offered us each a glass of wine with the special, which was penne pasta with a creamy sherry wine sauce and sliced chicken, topped with bruschetta. It was a unique taste to me-- I've never tasted such a wonderful mix of flavors in Italian cooking. We treated ourselves to canoli's for desert which were, of course, heavenly-- far and above the best I've ever had.   The waiter was friendly throughout the experience and the rest of the staff was polite. The employees here seem to take pride in the quality of their service and the regulars clearly know they've stumbled on to a real gem located in nondescript suburbia. There is no doubt that we will be returning to sample the many other delicious sounding dishes here.",

OH MY JESUS!  I need to tell you to try their tomato bisque, out of this world.

    "text": "This little hole in the wall has lived up to its stars. I visited once for lunch and once for dinner, both with my school-aged boys in tow. It's a cool little place to go to enjoy your meal. It's got this neat little Italian deli feel to it, but with table service.   For lunch, there are some really good specials. 2 slices of pizza and a drink, or a slice of pizza and a salad and a drink for $4.99. The pizza was tasty, and the waiter asked if we wanted to add toppings to the slices, which is great if you want more than just cheese. I'm guessing they charge for it, but we just had the cheese.  Their house salad is delicious. It's not just a few pieces of wilted lettuce on a plate with some bottle sauce plopped on it. Tasty veggies on top, and the house vinagrette is tangy, tasty, and should be sopped up with the hot bread they bring you.  Our dinner experience was a little different. My boys and I happened to go on a Friday evening, and we got seated at a table by the front, which meant we got stared at while we ate our food by the folks either waiting for a table or sitting at the chairs at the front waiting for their takeout order. It's a tiny restaurant, so I don't fault them for that. If you're looking for an intimate dining experience, this may not be the place for you.  The boys split a pepperoni pizza, and you really can't go wrong with their pizza. A great meal at this place would be a house salad, pizza and a beer. No doubt.  I tried their signature Buon Gusto chicken entree. The way it sounded on the menu and the way it came out on the plate were different. The menu called it a \"medley\" of fresh vegetables sauteed with chicken. The menu said it was a heathly menu choice, so I figured I'd watch my waistline and order it. The dish came out looking like a dish I make with all the leftover chicken and veggies I have in my fridge. There was a large amount of onions, which I picked past. There was no starch with the dish, which was odd, considering the fact that it's an Italian restaurant. Then I read the online menu after the fact and read that with chicken dishes, you can add a starch for a price. That's fine, but I wish the waiter had said something when I ordered.  The service was fine, nothing to write home about. Perhaps they just need to talk to their waitstaff so that they are more knowledgeable about the menu and can turn their tables over faster with quicker service.  All in all, if you stick to the basics, you're fine. Their pizza is tasty. Thier salad is yummy. They bring you a basket of hot breat and butter. And if you want to wash it down with a beer or wine, well, they have that too.   It's a cool little place, and I'm all for supporting the small businesses in this economy. Go to Buon Gusto. Enjoy the food and the vibe. But you may just want to stick to their Italian basics.",

Penne al a Vodka, linguini and clams in white wine sauce and chicken piccata, and started with a large antipasto platter.  We didn't realize the dinners came with soup or salad so we had Wedding Soup since we had ordered the antipasto salad.  Soup was just okay but everything else was worthy on going back again.  My wife and I had to get to go boxes because the portions were decent in size.  Prices were reasonable for the portion size and the quality of the food. We had an early dinner so it was not busy, I'm sure that it picked up later as we were done by 5:30.  This is a great little place, once people realize it is there, it will get harder to get right in.  There was talking and laughter in the kitchen which means they want to be there.  Friendly, quaint and good food.  I would recommend you give this place a go if your in the neighborhood.",

    "text": "What comes to mind with my meal here?? Lackluster to say the least.  After seeing so many positive reviews on Yelp, Cesar Q and I decided to stop by.  We were greeted upon entering the restaurant and told we could sit wherever we wanted.  We sat down and were immediately asked what we would like to drink.  Our beverages were brought and we placed our order.  Since we both ordered an entree it comes with a small green salad with your choice of dressing.  My salad arrived and there were so many tiny sliced olives (I despise olives) so I was forced to pick through and push them to the side.  All in all my salad was tasty.    Our entrees came shortly after our salads.  We both ordered the same thing, chicken franchese with an add on of a side of pasta.  The chicken was brought to the table and both my hubs and I looked at each other puzzled.  The meal that was set before us sooooo did not represent what we saw in all the awesome yelp pics.  Our chicken appeared to be one small chicken breast that had been pounded out and cut into 4 small pieces.  It was surrounded by a bright yellow sauce.  Now don't get me wrong, the sauce was tasty but it was seriously YELLOW!  The chicken was not browned as it should have been (imho).  Eventually the side of pasta was brought to the table (chicken already consumed).  We asked for bread, kinda wondered why we had net gotten it sooner.  Guess you have to ask.  The bread came after we were done with the pasta so we basically scooped up all the sauce.  The restaurant is small but very comfortable.  Decent ambiance.  I don't mind paying for good food and while we did walk out satisfied I was not pleased with the portion size considering what we paid.  $15.95 for the chicken and an additional $2.95 for the side of pasta.  The meal for 2 came to $40 plus tip for lunch.  That's nuts!!!",

    "text": "Buon Gusto. I'm very much in like with you.   Knowing this place gets packed on Saturday nights and the fact that they only boast eight or so tables, the GF and I decided to call-in our order, thinking this would be faster, that was not the case.   We went with Italian style sub sandwiches, one chicken parm and one meatball with a side order of sausage and marinara, the very classic and basic of Italian deli style eats. Once ordered we were told it would be about 15 minutes, upon arrival we found out our food was still not ready, but we were reassured that everything would be done shortly. Another ten minutes later, still no sandwiches in my hand.   After waiting another five minutes and noticing the place wasn't that busy, we asked how much longer, \"they should be done very soon... what was your order again?\". Excuse me, how do you know if the food will be done soon if you don't even remember what my order was? Hearing this response and realizing that the fella behind the counter didn't seem to care about the tardiness of our food, my GF got a little heated and exclaimed that we had been waiting over thirty minutes for two sandwiches. The fellas response, \"thirty minutes, are you sure?\". I was stunned at that response and thought my GF was going to jump over the counter. After this delightful interaction our food finally arrived and we headed home.   After unwrapping everything we noticed it was piping hot, this was good sign. The cheese was still melting and everything looked and smelled fresh. The bread was super soft and the sauce was flavorful and had some heat to it. The meatball sub was a very heavy meal, but the meatballs were great and a little misshapen, which hopefully proves the fact that they make them in house. I only had a bite of the chicken parm, but the chicken was tender and the breading was crisp.   After a rocky start at Buon Gusto, the food more than made up for the wait time. This isn't me saying I like waiting thirty minutes for food, but if you're going wait that stuff better be on point!",

    "text": "After an afternoon of shopping, my friend and I were famished and decided to try Buon Gusto for dinner since we had a coupon.   We walked in at 8pm and it took some time to get seated since it's a pretty small place. We were finally seated and our waitress took our drink order.   I ordered the baked ziti Siciliano and the Italian wedding soup. Our order took a pretty long time coming out and after about 20 minutes of waiting the waitress came out to let us know that she was sorry for the wait since they had apparently closed down the kitchen without letting her know and that they had to start it all up again to cook our orders and that of another table that came in before us. I'm a little surprised and disappointed that they decided to close down the kitchen a good hour before they were scheduled to close. Seems like a bad business practice.   If we had known that the kitchen was closed, we would have found another place to eat, but after waiting so long we figured we might as well wait it out.   The soup was lukewarm, not surprising after hearing about the kitchen snafu. Our entrees finally came out and they were decent. My pasta was good and I enjoyed the sauce quite a bit. The eggplant was overcooked and had an unappealing texture.  Our server was sweet and she kept an upbeat attitude despite all the shenanigans that seemed to be going on in he kitchen. The kitchen staff seemed to be playing around and more focused on wanting to leave for the evening, which made us uncomfortable and we ended up rushing through our meal to leave.  I see this being a decent spot for take out, but try not to come by too close to closing time.",

We had one guy say that our order was \"gross\" because we asked for a sauce substitute on baked manicotti.   The food quality has definitely gone down hill as well overall.

The service became terrible and the food was worse. Hadn't been in almost two years.  I just saw it at this new location in Anthem and decided to give it another try because it used to be amazing. I tried to order something to go. The hostess got it wrong literally seven times (I even wrote it down for her at one point) and I had to go back to the kitchen entryway twice to ensure they got it right, and they still forgot the bread.   It took well over 30 mins for two plates of pasta, bread, and side salads, and they had to re-do my check twice because they charged me for the tortellini I originally wanted (but they were out of it and didn't tell me about it for ten mins).   Side note: The hostess who took my order had no idea what tortellini was (at an Italian restaurant) and when I said I wanted Thousand Island dressing and Caesar dressing (for the salads, of course) she thought I wanted them as the sauces on top of my actual pasta. Wow.  The place was deserted during dinner rush on a Saturday night- people at three tables out of what seemed to be about 30 tables possible, the air conditioning was sorely insufficient (I was literally sweating while I waited), and everyone looked absolutely miserable- customers at tables, other pick-up customers, and everyone on staff.  I am giving them one star because I somehow actually ended up with acceptable food in the end.",

I found this place on yelp and decided to call. I told them we had 13 people coming and would be there within 45 minutes. We arrived and they already knew who we were! The place is definitely on the smaller side (which we didn't realize) but they accommodated us well. We had to wait a bit for our food because their kitchen is smaller but it was worth the wait. We chatted with some locals while waiting and they were so friendly. They gave us some ideas on what to do and where to go.  The food was by far AMAZING.Definitely family style Italian. Reminded me of home to be honest. The portions were well worth it and plentiful. The bill wasn't that bad either and they were able to split checks efficiently and easily for us. I would definitely return when I make it to Vegas again and I loved how they made us feel like family!",

Waitress was wonderful and food was great. My suggestions would be to get rid of the paper napkins and table paper. And get some food runners. The waitress should not be running the food, getting the bread, bringing all the drinks. You have a great location and great food. But you need to step up your service.

From the inexplicable wait to be noticed and seated to the inattention by the wait staff the evening was a disaster. First the wrong wine, then an awful wine, then a bug in the wine then a cockroach on the floor, a nice evening out gone wrong. After all that, the food tasted bad.

I love to patronize a family business. Maybe i will give them a shot.",

(By the way the sausage and mushroom rigatoni and chicken franchese are worth eating all the time, even if it will force me to keep my shirt on at the pool] I would absolutely put it in my top 3 Italian restaurants in the city.",

Well....just went today and either it has changed hands or is under new management. None of the previous family owners or staff were there. It was sooooo dark in the place that we had to use the flashlight on the cell phone to read the menu. We should have left at that point. My partner ordered a lunch special which was a slice of pizza and a side salad. I ordered a hot sandwich which also came with a side salad. I asked what dressings they had and when the waiter mentioned caesar dressing I said I would have that. He then told me that caesar dressing was $1 extra. Told him not to bother. We then ordered our drinks. He never bothered to bring staws and we had to ask for them. About 5 min later my partner was served her pizza and salad. Her salad had ranch dressing on it but you had to really look to find any. Guess ranch is expensive as well?? I got my salad. After about another 5 min I asked if there was a problem with my sandwich and was told rather rudely that it took time and would be ready soon. Another 10 min and my partner had already finished her food and I told they guy to forget the sandwich and bring the bill. He rudely told me it had only been 5 min and it would be ready soon. Anyway he finally bright the bill and had charged us for all the food and drink even though I had cancelled the sandwich before it was served. We gave him a $20 bill and asked for change. The revised bill and change did not show up so went to the counter and told him to give me the change and to revise the bill. Eventually another person came over and revised the bill and we got our change and left. I have not had this rude of service anywhere in years and not once did anyone in the restaurant apologize or even say they were sorry. The pizza was just ok, dont know about the rest of the food.....never got any. The staff even had the nerve to suggest that rather than change the bill they would fix the sandwich to go. It would only take a couple of minutes. !!!! Right !!!!! Anyway dont know when it changed hands but this place is horrible now. Will not go back...you could not pay me enough money to return.  There are many more places to eat in the area and suggest you try any of them....they cant be as bad as this place. No wonder they had so few customers.",

She ordered the lasagna and was quite disappointed. It amounted to what looked like one big pasta noodle and gobs and gobs of sauce  It was supposed to be meat sauce but I'll be darned if I could find a hint of beef in it.  Very little cheese as well. Also the bread portion for two was really tiny. I ordered the eggplant parmesan New York style and it was pretty good. However I did notice that the portions got a lot smaller and it was not as good as I remember. Also the side pasta was really tiny. I'm guessing their main chef may have been off that night. Anyway I doubt that I will be back. We should have sent the meals back or should have said something. On the positive side our waitress was very nice and efficient.",

Love the salad with house dressing, great pizza with crispy crust, delicious eggplant parm, and  everything else we've tried has been great. What a hidden treasure this place is.

Early Friday dinner, not crowded yet took nearly 45 minutes for an order of ravioli and a small pizza. The there was the bland taste. Ever so slightly better than big box chain Whitewash Italian. Pizza crust tuff, as if old or overworked. No sauce to speak of and overly cheesy. Ravioli on the hard side of al dente, nearly tasteless meat filling.   On the positive side, the staff were very friendly and apologetic on the long wait. Perhaps locals prioritize service over food. Otherwise visitors should go elsewhere.",

I heartily suggest \"boo boo's baked spaghetti\"... simply spaghetti marinara with a layer of melted cheese out of the oven, but to die for.   It's a small dining room, but worth the cozy atmosphere. The employees always look happy to be there, and always willing to be of service.   So glad I found this place :)",

    "text": "I have had Buon Gusto bookmarked for some time, and I finally went for lunch.  Very glad I did.  I arrived before noon on a Tuesday and was the only person in the joint.  I was served immediately.  I had the chicken parmesan sub, which comes with a side (choice of fries, cold pasta salad, or dinner salad) for $6.95.  This is a substantial sub, the length of the bread is not long, maybe a little more than 6 inches.  But, it's PACKED full of sauce, cheese, and a perfectly fried chicken cutlet.  I'd rather have more items in the sandwich and a shorter roll than a foot long roll with hardly any ingredients.  So, this was perfect for me.  Everything went together well, the sauce is seasoned well and the chicken is juicy.  This is a great example of what chicken parm subs should be.  And, served with a side for only 7 bucks!  Great price.  Because it was my first time and I had read good things about the meatballs (I also skipped breakfast, so I was sufficiently hungry) I decided to get the side of meatballs, which is $5.95 for 2 large meatballs smothered in sauce.  These were fantastic.  I didn't finish one, like I said, I had the sandwich, but I took the remainder of the meatballs home.  They were even good cold.  Juicy and paired well with the sauce.  These were winners.  Buon Gusto is a fantastic neighborhood Italian joint.  It's reasonably priced and operated by friendly people.  This is what small neighborhood restaurants should be.",

While we were waiting, the kitchen gave us free garlic knots.    Once seated, we were seen by our waitress immediately for drinks and appetizers.  We ordered the fried ravioli, cheesy garlic bread, and  calamari. Everything was good, but the fried ravioli was the best I've ever had!  It had plenty of filling and just enough crisp.  For dinner I ordered Bobos baked spaghetti and Sean ordered lasagna. It was all very tangy and delicious! If you hate garlic, maybe you won't like it so much but we do and we loved it!

The staff was also very professional and quick to fulfill every need.   Right away our server brought out fresh, hot sliced bread with olive oil, garlic and balsamic... Wow! Great start to our meal.. I ordered the pasta with garlic and olive oil which included a salad with their house made ranch(which was creamy and delicious). My husband had the lasagna which came out piping hot.. still boiling in the pan.. I can definitely say that the lasagna was the best I've tasted.. the presentation being a plus. His dinner also included a salad which he upgraded to a caesar salad. To top our meal off, we had Chef Joel's signature bread pudding for dessert. WOW!!!! I would come back specifically for this dish. It was served hot with an addicting rum sauce as well as freshly made whipped cream that had been frozen to deliciousness.    I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone. We cant wait to return.",

The chicken francese was full of pepper and no lemon taste and the pasta was also disgusting  The salad for $8 was put in a styrofoam container that was the same size as the salads that came with the 2 chicken entrees. They forgot the chicken and the buon gusto dressing was watered down and tasteless. So all 3 meals were inedible and we wasted a lot of money on garbage and that's where it went in the garbage.

Buon Gusto moved right up to the top of my list for Italian food in the valley and best of Henderson. The food is top notch, I have had the Shrimp Parmigiana, the Chicken Marsala and the Chicken Parmigiana, all were excellent. The chicken melts in your mouth. The salads are great with homemade garlic ranch and raspberry vinaigrette dressings and excellent quality lettuce. Even the oil and vinegar for the bread was about as good as I have ever tasted. The service was phenomenal (thank you Chris!) and the rest of the staff is excellent. My only regret is that I waited five years after moving from the Northeast to find this place, but I will be back again and again! Buon Gusto means good taste in English, but this place has great taste!",

    "text": "I love this small, local Italian restaurant!  Being from NY, I often long for those non-chain gems.  The ones whose decor is charming and welcoming; where the service is genuinely hospitable; where the food is like a warm reminder of home cooked family dinners.  This is one of the closest I've found to that in Las Vegas.   We noticed right away how small the restaurant is, but I like that about it!  It wasn't overly busy when we went but I could see how it would get tight at dinner time on weekends.    The food was delicious!  It had the authentic home cooked meal flair.  The portions were so generous.  I took half a plate of baked ravioli home because I just couldn't finish it.  And I'm so glad to have leftovers to enjoy!  Even the side salad was a great mix, although I wasn't as crazy about the house balsamic vinaigrette as I thought I'd be.   We often get coupons for this place in the free newspaper that comes to our door - either 3 dollars off a pie or buy one meal get one 50% off (good only during the week after 4pm).  But there's also a yelp check-in offer for the same.  Every penny counts, especially since dinner can rack up when you add wine and desserts (which are pretty reasonably priced!).    Will definitely be back here for dinner and to try the pizza, especially since I'll only be 10 minutes away soon!",

    "text": "DO NOT EAT HERE!! It's become apparent that the many 4-5 star reviews were given to the previous owners and this place is not as good as it comes across. My girlfriend and I were lured in by the positive reviews and it was a close location to our house. Unfortunately, our food was extremely questionable to the point that I had to ask the waiter if it was frozen.   The chicken parm was one of the worst dishes I've ever been served (soggy, tough, and bland), and we ended up sending the food back.  Overall, it's overpriced, bland, and I'm pretty sure it was frozen. You're better off at the Cheesecake Factory or even Olive Garden for that matter.",

    "text": "Excellent service. The service is probably what stuck with me more than the food. The restaurant is located in the corner of a shopping center on Horizon Ridge and Eastern -- pretty difficult to spot unless you are familiar with the area.  Inside of the restaurant is compact, charming, and homely (in a comforting way). The male server that greeted us may have been the owner. He was interested in hearing how we heard of the place, made sure to explain the menu and offer suggestions based on some of his favorites, and checked in on us regularly throughout the meal.  We opted for the calamari \"best in town\" as an appetizer ($8.95). It was fine, cooked tender but overkill on the batter.  The food, or perhaps what I ordered, wasn't mind blowing or innovative. It was simple chicken marsala, and sure maybe it is partly my fault for going for the basic, unimaginative option, but to my credit the menu did claim \"best marsala in town\". Not sure that I will agree there. There really is only so much you can do with a straightforward dish like that, hence why I will not dock them more than a star for the food. The chicken was cooked well, marsala wine sauce was fine, and the mushrooms were...mushroomy?  The meal did come with the option of soup or salad; I opted for the chicken and mushroom soup. The soup was really, really good. I also opted for a side of baked ziti in regular tomato sauce. That also was not very memorable. But the meal was a great value for $16.95.  I love Italian food, it is the first type of food I learned how to cook and excel in, so maybe I should just not go out to eat at Italian places because my expectations are really really high. I go as far as making my own homemade pasta and sauce with as many natural and fresh ingredients as I can.  I have yet to be wowed by an Italian eatery with the exception of Scarpetta.",

She also forgot to ring in something that we ordered, but immediately told us once she realized. I appreciate when service staff is honest, and it turned out we were stuffed, so we decided to just get it to go.   It's a small place, but they seem to be always busy. (may have to wait for a table, but totally worth it)   Now about the food: Meatballs are very flavorful (I recommend adding them to the top of the manicotti dish, which is now my favorite.  The soup of the day was chicken pot pie, and it was seriously one of the best things I've ever put in my mouth. Sooo yummy.  Other entrees I'd recommend are lasagna, baked Ziti and the gnocchi. I haven't tried the pizza, but I'll definitely be back.",

Salad left us wondering what the hell?? Just really nothing to it. Just boring Entrees=Spaghetti and Meatballs and Baked Penne Pasta with Meatballs. The sauce they use is sweet and tomatoey. Yech. Just not very good. Meatballs were full of herbs that overpowered the flavor. Big size too much herbal flavor. Will keep looking. Must be affordable great Italian food somewhere in this towm",

    "text": "After a beer festival in Lake LV, we needed to fuel up. With the positive reviews and comforting looking food it seemed it would be a winner dinner.   We were started off with some fresh hot bread, oil with garlic to dip. They ask if you want balsamic in it too which I never refuse. Man, I love/hate good bread. Love the taste, hate that I can't stop. Entrees come with a salad or soup. We got one of each. The soup was pasta fagioli, which had various pasta and white beans and had good flavor, though a tad salty. The salad was good with olives, tomatoes, onions, artichoke, pepperoncini with vinaigrette.   We got sausage rigatoni with tomato cream sauce. The sauce was solid, well seasoned and it was plentiful with sausage. We also ordered the linguine clams with red sauce which was a nicely garlicky clam flavored sauce and the clam pieces was so plentiful every bite had clams. This is a good thing that the portions were not skimpy, but not suffering in quality. I asked if the pasta made in-house, but it's fresh stuff delivered from a spot in New Jersey. Some people may find it oversauced a bit, which doesn't bother me - it's bread sopping time! I was too full with all of this pasta and bread.   Its a tiny busy eatery, but many servers and runners so the service was pretty decent even when our main gal was busy. Everyone was friendly and polite. Lot's of \"ma'ams\" we're thrown around which I'm not used to.   Charming little place. If this wasn't across town from us, I could see us going here on a regular basis. Food taste to portion to price ratio is really good. For $15ish a pasta dish we had bread, soup, salad and entree which I think is reasonable for all you get. This is like, Olive Garden formula and prices, but homemade and homey. I'm a fan, and would consider their something I would try to hit up anytime we're never Henderson.",

The salad was fresh and nice but nothing exceptional. The bread was very good and served warm. My 3 guests had sausage & mushroom rigatoni, chicken parmigiana, and linguini del mare. They were all good  tho' not outstanding. The teramisu was outstanding, however. Overall, the quality of food is comparable to Nora's and Pasta Shop Restaurant, and better than Gina's Bistro. You also get more for your money. I would recommend it.",

My husband had the Boo Boo's Baked Spaghetti (excellent) and I had the Tortellini with Tomato Cream Sauce (also excellent).  Tortellini is often tough, and these were so tender....the cream sauce was perfect.  They served a generous side salad and piping hot italian rolls.  Apparently, it is more casual at lunch - where at night, they are supposed to have candles on the table, Italian music, etc.  We watched the pizzas coming out of the oven....and they looked delicious.  It's fun to find new restaurants....and this one is so close to the Anthem area in Henderson.  Definitely will go back!",

But except for Settebello (which does a very crispy crust with minimal toppings), we have hated all the local pizza places, especially the chains.  I remembered that Buon Gusto also made pizza, so I called in an order of our traditional toppings:  sausage, mushrooms, and onions.  Oh, my goodness, did that HIT THE SPOT.  The crust was New York style (thin, but chewy) and the toppings were REAL.  Yes, Virgina, someone makes a pizza here in suburbia that is not canned and processed.  The pizza sauce was fresh, but not overwhelming.  And we were eating this pie after a 15 minute trip in the car!  I imagine that eating it inhouse (as we prefer to eat all our pizzas) can only be better.  I have to stop talking about this now or I will want to order another one right away.",

I remembered it as the best pizza I've had and have been bragging about it for a long time.  Since then, I've brought a few others and each time, all my friends were less than impressed but I attributed it to my overhyping the place.  I finally brought my family last night to refresh my memory and to use a gift certificate that one less-than-impressed friend had bought me as a joke for my birthday since I told him it was the best pizza.  We ordered the extra large Bronx Bomber, the linguine with clams, and a side of meatballs.  As much as I wanted to validate my past opinion, the food was really just average in my humble opinion.  You can tell the ingredients were fresh but the flavors were just so-so.  The pizza was ok, the linguine was better though my family thought it was a little bland and oily, but the meatballs were lacking (which surprised all of us since this is a very authentic Italian restaurant).  The service was great and the small little mom and pop atmosphere was very homey.  Would come back but will definitely not be hyping this place anymore as having the best pizza.",

I have been to so many restaurants throughout my life. I lived on the east coast and the west coast and been to so many places that just served mediocre food. Some of it was good, but not great. I remember my cousin went to Buon Gusto and she told me about it. She said to me that she could not believe how authentic-tasting the food was, and how it was just like our family's cooking. My mom is such a wonderful cook so I know the difference between Italian food and great Italian food. Everytime I come here, everything is on the money. Every detail, ingredient, and server is incredible. The place is so welcoming, warm, and so intricate. The food is TO DIE for. And I don't know about you but if the food is this good, I don't care how much I pay for it. This place has yet to disappoint me or anyone that I recommended it to. I honestly feel like I am eating right out of my mother's kitchen. Incredible food and service, and I highly recommend this place to anyone who wants great quality and great, authentic Italian food. You will not be disappointed at all. I will be coming here for as long as I live in Vegas. I feel like I just want to scream and shout to the world about this place!",

We ordered the Bronze bomber that had the usual meats, pepperoni, sausage, meatballs and good amount of the regular vegetable and peppers.  This was a perfect pizza with 3 different sizes to choose from depending on your hunger level.  My husband ordered the chicken cacciatore, that is pounded thin, again with onion pepper and smothered in Sicilian red sauce.  Super tender, with a familiar Italian fennel taste to the meal.  Add a side of spaghetti for $2.95.    The warm baguette style bread is baked fresh and comes out super soft and irresistible.  The bread is paired with their chopped garlic, olive oil and of course red vinegar.  The garlic permeated the dipping sauce and that's why it was so addictive.    The ambiance is nothing to write home to.  It feels like a super outdated, casual place that you wouldn't expect from the exterior.  I'm surprised they have outdoor seating, which is unusually located just a step away from the parking lot.    The prices are not the most competitive, but the meal was memorable for us.",

Owner stoped to say hi and also kept her cool and thanked us for coming to the new place, just 5 more minutes up on Eastern",

It would be alright if it was just a one time thing but it's EVERY TIME!!! The food might be good but something is definitely wrong here. I cringe every time I have to come here.",

Pesto sauce ok but the tortellini was way over cooked. Eggplant was ok but bitter. We were 4 adults and they gave us 5 slices of bread! Talk about cheaping it out! Service was nice but very slow.

Truly disgusting and overcooked pasta with water as a \"marsala sauce.\" The only reason they got 2 stars instead of one was the good customer service from the manager Kimberly when I called to complain about our meal, she refunded our money and apologized for the disappointing meal but the damage was done. You should do some quality control on the kitchen before sending food like this home with someone. We won't be back.",

This is really my kind of place - near my house, great food and what you may consider a \"hole in the wall.\"  There are maybe only 8 tables, so be prepared to wait if it's busy. Luckily, we were there on a Tuesday night and it was pretty slow. We were immediately seated and given some time to look over the menu.  Our server was a bit awkward, but it's no big deal. You really get your money's worth here - I ordered the chicken piccata, which may have been some of the best I've ever had. To start, we were served fresh out of the oven baked bread with oil and vinegar. Then we had a really good starter salad. I was surprised at the quality of this salad - the lettuce was crisp and fresh, they added artichoke hearts, cheese, tomatoes, etc.   Along with your entree, you get a choice of pasta with either marinara or garlic and oil. It wasn't too big of a portion and was a perfect complement to my meal. The flavor of the wine sauce and the chicken was fantastic! I took home leftovers, which I had in my lunch at work the next day and everyone was very jealous.   It was so good, and very reasonably priced and I can't wait to go back!! It was a perfect date night.",

    "text": "We LOVE Buon Gusto's food.  We have eaten at Buon Gusto a dozen times now so I have a good sense of this restaurant and its fare. This is simple Italian cooking done well.  There's no pretense to this little restaurant at all. There are not a lot of tables, and it always surprises me that there isn't a longer wait.  I suppose people calculate the wait potential based on their small seating area beforehand. I know we do, and we've only been one Friday and one Saturday because we fear a long wait.  The service here is excellent with the exception of one waitress who is slow, unable to multitask, and inattentive, but the excellent food overcomes her inabilities.  ALL of the wait staff are friendly and courteous though.   We have a few favorites on their menu, and I think all are their signature items.  The Artichokes Italiano are fantastic.  A prefect combination of creamy, acid, saltiness, and garlic.   Use the bread to mop up the remaining sauce, it's THAT good.    You can't go wrong with ANY dish that uses their roasted red pepper sauce.  The sauce is creamy and the sweetness and toastiness of the red pepper shines through right up front and you get nice peppery notes on the finish. A wonderful sauce.  The Sausage and Mushroom Rigatoni is excellent.  The fresh mushrooms are not overpowered by wonderful sweet Italian sausage.  The tomato cream sauce brings it all together for a truly well balanced pasta and meat dish.   Finally, finish it all with their home made tiramisu or with their salted caramel gelato.  We love Buon Gusto.  Love the food, the staff, and the service.  I almost hate to write a review that sings its praises as we want to keep this lovely little gem of a restaurant all to ourselves.",

Every now and again we foodies run across a hole in the wall that is so good, we really shouldn't post about it on Yelp, just in case the crowds get to big, well Buon Gusto is one of those places.  We have eaten there probably once a month for the last 6 months, the food is good, no scratch that, the food is superb, the service is good, the prices are a steal.  Now, the big thing, this is a New York Italian joint, my wife orders the Chicken Marsala (the best she has had she claims) but I go for the pizza, why ? Because it is the best in Vegas, pure and simple, I love pizza and this joint puts out a pie that I would happily compare to any that I ate in new York.

I've literally waited once for 2 hours to get my food when the restaurant was half empty. It was so bad it was 10 minutes before they closed that I finally got my food.

On this particular night I ordered 2 large pies and was told they would be ready in 25 mins for pickup. Well it's 45 mins now since the order and I'm still sitting here along with 3 others waiting. The guy next me ordered his food 50 mins ago.  As I was waiting, I watched as the management was stressing that they were about to run out of mozzarella cheese.  I'm not sure what was more of a shock, 1) that they no longer use fresh mozzarella on their foods and pizza and buy their mozzarella at Sam's club in bags, or 2) that they had almost run out of cheese on a Saturday night! What kind of Italian restaurant runs out of  mozzarella cheese on a Saturday night? Who is responsible for ordering supplies? Unreal. Anyway, 55 minutes and $50 for (2) large cheese pies, and to top it all when I got home they never cut both of the pizzas! The mozzarella cheese was awful on the pizzas. It had a really funny taste and we ended up throwing out 1/2 of each pie. It's extremely unfortunate because this was one on of my favorite Italian places in all of Las Vegas. This is the 3rd time I've had problems with food from Buon Gusto and for me 3 strikes you're out. I will not be returning or recommending it to any of my friends. Also note, I understand places get busy on Saturday nights and I was actually surprised when they said it would be ready in 25 mins. However, don't waste my 30 mins of my time because you can't estimate when an order will be ready.",

The salads were delicious but when our entree came it was a different story.  His ziti tasted microwaved. The noodles were mushy and the sausage was sliced so thin. Mine was supposed to come with pasta, but didn't.  Two greasy crab cakes in a huge pile of an inconsistent, lumpy, sad excuse for a roasted red pepper sauce. I was offered gelato in lieu of no pasta.  No thanks, ice cream doesn't make everything better.  So I received the appetizer crab cakes but was charged for the entree.  When I told the waitress that, she tried to tell me the crab cakes were different size vs the app and entree. Get out of here lady. They took 1.80$ of my meal for their mess up. Worst 60$ I've spent in a minute.   I do what you do everyday and you shouldn't disagree with the customer when you guys obviously messed up.  I don't believe there was a person there over the age of 22 and the maturity in that place really showed.  Won't ever be back and you've been warned!",

On a side note, where we were sitting to where I could see the prep area where salad greens were being cut. The knife that was used was rinsed off with the water from the soda fountain. Not sure what was cut with the knife before, but not too sanitary.   Hopefully on our next visit things will be back up to speed and prep procedures will be reviewed.",

    "text": "Got the spaghetti with meatballs. Food was alright.  Mondays they have reduced staff, so if it gets busy you'll have to wait a while for service. Even with a 8+ person party coming in while we were dining we still got decent service, and they managed to whip up some extra scampi sauce for my mother.  The comments about this place being a \"hole in the wall\" are pretty much accurate, size-wise. This place is about as roomy as a walk-in closet, and you can get seated right next to the kitchen area, so there's constantly people going past or around you, especially to access the little cabinet in the hallway.  As long as you can stand the small space, the food's good, if a bit expensive. If you're in the mood for Italian, definitely consider this place -- just be wary if it's busy.",

    "text": "We decided to try this place because of the other (mostly) great reviews on Yelp and it was close to our house.  I was craving Italian and wanted to try a non-chain restaurant.  We arrived at the restaurant at around 630 on a Wednesday evening and the place was full.  It is a very small restaurant with about 8 tables total, but we were seated and greeted very quickly and with a smile.  I will say that the service we received was very friendly - no issues there.  I ordered the baked lasagna and added a Caesar salad ($3 surcharge), my wife ordered the shrimp scampi, my son the spaghetti & meatballs and my daughter the kid's fettuccine alfredo with the broccoli cheese soup.  We were provided a bread basket with oil and balsamic vinagarette - tasty.  The ambiance was fine, although we were seated right next to the kitchen door - it's a small place, so that wasn't really an issue for us.  We received our salads and soups and I will say that both me and my son were disappointed with the caesar salads - the lettuce was drenched in dressing and it wasn't very pleasant.  I certainly don't think it was anything special to warrant an additional $3 upcharge from a regular salad.  The soup, however, was very tasty.  Our entrees arrived shortly after and after tasting a few bites, we all looked at each other with a level of disappointment.  The food is NOT bad at all; however, we certainly have had much better at other places.  The meals, in general, were very bland.  There was nothing special about any of the entrees and it certainly did not warrant the price $15+ each.  There are a lot of Italian eateries in town and there was nothing at this place that would compel me to return.  We wanted to really like this place as we are all in favor of supporting family-owned businesses, but the taste has to be there and it wasn't for us.",

We were attending yet another conference and were in dire need to escape the insincerity of corporate America.  We were promptly greeted by the owner who sat us at a charming table. The service was prompt and the menu was priced reasonably.  The owner took the time to make menu recommendations and answered all questions.  Needless to say, my spinach and Gorgonzola ravioli was exceptional.    What you should really know   At the end of the evening, we were having difficulty getting a cab back to the hotel.  The owner was very attentive and after hearing that we would have to wait 30-50 minutes he promptly took off his apron and directed us to his SUV. In less than 5 minutes we were back at the hotel compliments of Buon Gusto.  After a long week of exhausting meetings and corporate niceties, this was genuine service.  In short, Buon Gusto doesn't do anything different - they just do it better.",

My friend had never been and I'd been to Buon Gusto several times and always had wonderful experiences there - except this time. It took 10-15 minutes just to be acknowledged upon arrival. No host/hostess was in sight.  After we were seated, they took our order quickly and returned with our salads and then we waited...and waited...and waited. They didn't even offer us bread while we were waiting until we asked. The bread was fresh and soft but the oil was an overkill. Imagine 95% oil, 5% vinegar. 35 minutes later as we waited, a cockroach decided to join the party. It ran across the wall under one of the paintings and attempted to hop in my friend's purse. We let our server know but by the time he returned with something to kill the cockroach, it disappeared. That should have been our cue to leave but instead we decided to relocate to the front dining area. One hour and 15 minutes later plus 2 and a half loaves of bread, our food arrived. I ordered the sausage and mushroom rigatoni, and my friend ordered the champagne chicken. The sausage and mushroom rigatoni was subpar. It was basically rigatoni drowning in a store bought vodka sauce garnished with a handful of mushrooms and cut up sausage. The champagne chicken was terrible. The texture of the chicken breast was like plastic and it was pale in color. Neither of the dishes were hot either. It was definitely not worth $20.00. To top it off, the server was rushing us to pay our bill. They didn't offer to give us a discount on our bill and a manager didn't even come to our table to apologize for the cockroach or the wait for our food. It wasn't even that busy! Honestly, we couldn't get out of there fast enough.   The only positive things about our dining experience was the bread and the salad.",

    "text": "This review is overdue and is based on my experience at their old location. Really good locally owned Italian restaurant. Have only been here for lunch.   Chase was our server. He was so nice and told us it was his first day serving. He did such a good job serving and was eager to please.   Started off with complimentary bread served with butter and a really good garlic infused dipping oil. Had the lasagne and the lunch special of penne pasta with vodka sauce. Served with a really fresh salad. One of the cooks came out and asked how everything was which I always appreciate them asking.   The lunch special was a good sized serving. I even had leftovers to take home but that could be because of the salad or that I ate a whole loaf of bread with the insanely good dipping oil.  Other people eating were a mix of local couples or families and business people on their lunch breaks.   Now I need to visit them in their new location. Get out and support local businesses and help your neighbors do a little happy dance by supporting them :)",

My hubby enjoyed his spaghetti with meat sauce and my ravioli was ok. We ordered chocolate cake for dessert and it had mold on it. Immediately began second guessing all the other food. Waiter was kind and reassured us everything else was fresh but that's just an image that stays with you.",

They just keep passing us by and ignoring us, we have to check in if it's ready or not. The lady who took the order was disrespectful and had no manners whatsoever. I'm thinking she might be racist since it's kind of an affluent part of Henderson and majority of the customers were Caucasian and were not. She was acting all snobby and didn't care to check in what's up. It's whatever, this place gave me negative vibes and I don't need to eat there shit food and shit customer service.",

When entering I noticed lattice with plants running down, small tables with green and brown checkerboard patters (they were plastic mats, kinda lazy) and lots of small nooks covered in assorted items. It's feels a bit cramped with the beer fridge, wine rack, and wait station all in the dining room, but overall seems to work.  I ordered spaghetti and meatballs ad I fell that it's the True way to measure an Italian restaurant. If they can't do that right, walk out and never return. I have had quite a lot of frozen meatballs, sauce from a bottle and overcooked pasta. This was NOT one of those places. The meatballs were about baseball size and obviously fresh. I was sitting close enough to the kitchen to hear what was going on, and never heard a microwave.  The meatballs were seasoned and browned well and you could taste the fresh basil. The sauce was perfect as was the pasta.  The only thing I did not agree with was the wedding soup: tasteless, bland, and barely warm.  I would definitely return.",

He paid so I go with it and I'm sure I'll find something , not being s huge Italian food fan.   I stuck to appetizers, I wasn't disappointed! I got the artichoke Italiano and the stuffed mushrooms. How refreshing is it to go to a smaller Italian place and they use real crab meat instead of dumping breadcrumbs in with some onions and charging 12 dollars for it? The Mushrooms were awesome and they give you some lemon to hit with , elevating the flavor To a higher level. They were good  The real star of the show were the damn artichokes... life changing. These were so delicious. I swear I'm going to tell everyone about them.   My only gripe would be no utensils to sneak a bite on the way home and they don't do complimentary bread.  I'm defined going back, if for nothing but the damn artichoke",

    "text": "*UPDATED REVIEW Very upset how our meal was dealt with. My family placed an order to go for chicken Marsala and champagne chicken. They told us it would take 40 minutes. When my dad went in to pick up the food they told us him that don't have champagne chicken anymore (something they didn't mention on the phone when the order was placed 40 minutes earlier). My dad asked what they made instead and then he found out that the gentleman who took our order never actually placed it to be made so nothing was prepared. They told my dad it they could make the chicken Marsala, because it would only take \"5 minutes.\" They were unapologetic for their error and didn't even take responsibility. You would think that people who take orders would know what they do and do not have on their menu. Really sad to give them one star.  I have always had a soft spot in my head for Buon Gusto. I grew up eating their pizza every now and then and it was always fantastic. I even love it now as I've grown. The only thing that is making me not give it 5 stars is that they did have a change in either ownership/management. Since then I've noticed the quality and the service isn't 100% there. Right after the merge I remember waiting an hour for our meals. Another time they messed up an order 3 times. And once they even forgot to put mushrooms in a chicken marsala dish. I know that some of these things may sound like final straws, but I've had the patience to stick to this restaurant. I feel like if those who are there now really become passionate about the place it can be restored to the same quality it was at before.  I would still recommend it to anyone; it may just be a hit or miss.",

Server greeted us quickly.  Ordered Caesar salad with my spinach and cheese ravioli. Our salad was sitting on the counter for 5 min before being brought to our table.  We found ourselves waiting for the main a bit longer than we anticipated.  The server apologized for the wait.  I requested my ravioli with Alfredo sauce.  It tasted great!     The sauce nice and thick. I remembered reading on the menu that our meal comes with bread.  I asked our server he responded, \"would you like some?\"   As we are once again waiting... I find myself slowing down so that I can save some pasta to enjoy with the bread. Yayy! The bread is here.... Nice little loaf. Soft and warm inside with a thin harder crust. I was in the mood for dessert but opted out to avoid more wait time.  Our check was brought out on a cute plate that looks like a slice of pizza.  Looked cool against the picnic table cloth. We waited for everything except for our bill.  The prices looked good on the menu $8 Lunch with salad.   My ravioli was around $10. It would have been a good price, but I was charged $2.95 to change my sauce and an extra $2.50 for Caesar instead of the regular side salad.  The server did not inform me of any of those charges. Overall the server was pleasant, my food tasted good, but I would have liked our food to come in a timely manner.",

The tortellini with a cream tomato sauce was inedible so it was thrown away, I requested angel hair pasta with the chicken masala and they didn't include it, the stuffed mushrooms were cold and tasted fishy, and the antipasto was a joke...sliced deli meat on top of lettuce!!!  They say never say never?  I'm saying never.  I will NEVER patronize this restaurant again.",

    "text": "The only reason this place gets 1 star is because 0 is not an option.  Apparently this is a new location for this restaurant.  It is a total disaster.  The fun begins when we are offered a table by the door on a cold night when multiple other tables are available.  15 minutes later we are asked if we would like something to drink, and we ask to see a wine list.  10 minutes later wine order is taken and 10 minutes later it is actually served at which time we ask for bread and to order.  15 minutes later order is taken, bread is delivered, and water appears.  20 minutes later an undercooked, tasteless pizza is served.  10 minutes after that a salad drenched in balsamic vinagarette is served ( I had asked for dressing on the side).  20 minutes later lukewarm, tasteless, eggplant baked ziti is served.  Waiter apologizes for how busy they are.  I don't expect that to be a long-term problem.  Owner is visible, but apparently oblivious to what a disaster is occurring.  Multiple other diners are equally unhappy and several of us commiserate.  There are a multitude of other Italian restaurants in Henderson.  Every one of them is light years better than this.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying that ever since living in Italy I am extremely picky about Italian food. But, Buon Gusto shines every time. It is a small family run New York style Italian restaurant. The place is tiny, so expect to wait for a table, sometimes up to 30 minutes. Don't worry the food is well worth the wait. They always start you off with warm bread and an olive oil and balsamic dipping sauce. It is perfection, especially after the wait. Your dish will also come with soup or a salad. They have 2 homemade dressings, a delicious ranch and a house oil and balsamic dressing that is fantastic. You can't go wrong either way, but I love to dip my bread in the house dressing. Yum! I have tried quite a few dishes, but here are some of the highlights:  I am in love with the sausage and mushroom rigatoni. It is tossed in a creamy tomato based sauce and just so delicious. You won't ever regret ordering this, trust me.  They make a mean baked ziti as well, their signature pasta sauce is just delicious. You definitely want the sausage, as the meatballs are lacking in flavor.   They also have fantastic thin crust pizza's! I have tried both the California white pizza and Steve's cattleman and they were great. I love white pizza and the California definitely hit the spot. But, they also make a fabulous red sauce so be sure to try that as well. The individual size is perfect for one.  Overall, you will not regret a visit to this small mom and pop shop. The food is delicious and the service is always on point.",

This restaurant has new owners as of the beginning of the year and it has taken them a few months to settle in.  They did try changing a few of the recipes which was not in their favor.  They have now gone back to the original recipes and as of last night, I swear they have enhanced them in the best way possible!  Everything was absolutely tasty!  My favorite dish (the only one I eat) is the Chef's Cisco Style eggplant!  It is incredible in my opinion however I have never eaten eggplant at any other Italian restaurant.  The flavors of this dish are incredible!  I love all the garlic they use on their dishes!!  Their balsamic vinaigrette is so incredible it makes me want to lick my plate when my salad is gone but instead I use my bread to soak it up so I don't embarrass my husband!  They do offer Gluten Free products which most people don't know.",

First let me say that the guy (not sure of his name but has lots of ink)  who took my order and was at the counter when I arrived was super nice , excellent customer service. I got my order nice and hot.  House salad dressing was delish ( was recommended) now for the baked ziti. Not totally what I was expecting it was ziti with cause topped with cheese and 5 pieces of eggplant. Flavor wasn't bad  didn't have much ricotta cheese in it. I guess I should have asked but the eggplant was just that pieces of eggplant. I was thinking it would be baked into the ziti.  I will probably try it again but  go with a different dish",

He clearly didn't give a hoot about us.  In fact, now that I think back on that, I'm angry about it and, as a result, changed my rating from the 4 stars I planned to give to 3.

Many people may prefer sweet pasta sauces but it isn't our personal preference. The staff were friendly and the owner checked with us at the end. As others have mentioned, the sun coming through the windows is quite a problem with the layout of the restaurant. I wish they'd have sat us in the closed-off room since it gets less sun in the evening. We were hoping to love our meal and find a new neighborhood Italian restaurant; this isn't quite it, unfortunately.",

Both Marinara and Meat Sauce great; not acidic or overspiced, rather with a slight hint of sweetness. Meatballs very good. Pasta is properly \"al dente\".  And the big surprise; they serve Spumoni. Probably the best Spumoni in the Las Vegas area. Can't comment on the other desserts; did not make it past the Spumoni!!  Owner Kimberly pleasant and committed to quality of service. Highly recommend.",

    "text": "Came in for the first time tonite since the old Giadas moved out. First, host stand was not manned. Thats a big no-no in the restaurant biz. We stood at the host stand for 5-6 mins and several waiters looked at us but ignored us intentionally. I was about to walk out when a waiter came over to seat us.  Interior: very plain. Holes and scrapes in the walls. Also they are using throw away paper on the tables; now thats rediculous for a nice Italian place. It's just kind of looks a little rundown and dirty.  We ordered appetizers and they came out wrong. Upon telling the waitress they were the wrong food items she gave me a look like I had two heads. Correct appetizers were delivered and they were aweful. I had the wedding soup and it was obviously out of a can and so salty I could not finish it. In fact one hour after I eat the soup as I sit here typing miss the taste of salt in my mouth is so bad yuk!  Main course was good. Not great but good. We had pasta. Our waiter also never came back for drink refills and we had to hunt him down to ask.  Prices were a bit higher than in the center valley but in Hendo its always a bit more. I'm not saying the place is overpriced I felt that the food we got for the price was actually fair.  They need to spruce the place up a bit and work on training their wait staff on better service.",

Only thing I would add would be a little bit of mozzarella on top.  * Pasta with oil and garlic my husband liked a lot.  * Salad was excellent but house dressing is just balsamic vinaigrette. I thought they should have had an Italian house dressing. Salad included artichoke, olives, tomato and a pepper. I think a sprinkle of fresh parm would have been nice.  * Unlimited fountain soda included  * Oil for dipping bread outstanding if you love garlic! My husband poured it on his pasta lol  * $10 for lunch special ! Waitress not the best but owner helps out and checks on drinks and is super friendly. Can't wait to try her other lunch specials.

    "text": "Same restaurant - different location. We were in the Anthem Center and saw that Buon Gusto opened right here just 2 weeks ago, so we really wanted to be supportive and try it. The restaurant has 2 small rooms. The one away from the door has a bar area with 2 TVs (hockey game on while we were there). Our server, Drilon, was at our table very soon after we sat to get the drink order. Drilon is super friendly, the type of server you like immediately and will overlook a lot. Good thing we weren't in a hurry cause it took a really long time for him to come back to get our main order. And then an even longer time for the food to arrive. The meal comes with soup or salad. We each went with a salad. A little heavy handed on the dressing, so next time I will get dressing on the side. Overall, a pretty good side dinner salad. I ordered the chicken cacciatore with a side of penne in marinara sauce ($17). The chicken came buried in a brown sauce - to the point where you couldn't see the chicken. Not a great presentation. A fairly large portion and quite tasty. The penne made its appearance much later and was room temperature. My wife got the chicken Angelo, her go to dish when trying a new Italian restaurant. It was just OK. For her pasta side she asked for penne. Instead she got the meal served over fettuccine. Not a major offense except we were charged an extra $1.50 for the pasta for her dish. When I asked why her pasta side was an extra $1.50 while each of the other sides were included in the meal, I didn't understand the reasoning but I wasn't going to spend a lot of time on it for $1.50. I was torn between 3 and 4 stars, but the very friendly service and my dish being so tasty, I rounded up. Can't get too upset with the slow service - they are only open at this location for 2 weeks. I definitely will try them again once they have settled in.",

    "text": "My friend and I decided to come here a few days ago since: 1. I had never been and 2. she hadn't been in a while. When we go there, the venue was very small, and we had to move the table forward so we could both sit comfortably (I'm 6'8\").  The waiter was very professional, which was nice to see. He was able to accommodate my friends tomato allergies and make suggestions around it as well. We looked at the menu and almost everything was at least $14. Luckily, we had gotten there around lunch time, so we were able to chose from a menu of $8. Unfortunately, there is no substitutions on that menu, so my friend could only goose from two dishes.   I asked the waiter what the portions were like for the lunch menu, and he said that they were just a smidgen smaller than the dinner plate. We both ordered our drinks and food, and that's when we got bamboozled. They added $3 for the chicken in my chicken Alfredo, and when I asked for caesar dressing, they wanted to up charge me another $2. I said no, so we waited for our meals. My coke was pretty flat, so I was already in a sour mood about that. When the chicken Alfredo got there, it was 40% pasta and 60% sauce. The chicken tasted off and was very watery. We wanted to get dessert, but the next time we saw the waiter, he brought us our check instead of asking about dessert. We took that as a sign and went elsewhere.   Overall: 1 star for atmosphere, 1 star for waiter experience, 1 star for allergy accommodations, -1 star for price/up charging, -1 star for food quality. I probably would not come here again unless I had too, and I probably would not recommend it to anyone else.",

We gave our orders, she had the chicken Marsala and I had the Vodka Penne with chicken. The salads were good, one small serving of bread was brought to the table and never replenished.   Sad, really because the sauce in both dishes were really good.  I mention that we were seated at 7:30 because it was after 8:30 when our meals finally arrived. While the sauces were good, the chicken was rubbery and had an odd taste.  There was a man who came out and chatted and said he was a chef but they were not letting him work.  He said he was training them. Did he never watch Hells Kitchen?  If someone is in training, you taste the meals before sending them out and that clearly did not happen. Oh, did I mention he was drinking a beer as well?   So, back to my original statement. Don't.",

We got the sauteed artichoke appetizer which was insanely good, we ate a ton of delicious bread dipped in olive oil and herbs, and then we shared a huge plate of delicious home made ravioli. We topped it all off with an inexpensive bottle of red and after a long day of golfing, it more than just hit the spot, it became our new favorite spot.

Everyone is friendly and plates are priced/portioned well. My girlfriend and I love doing take outs from here whenever we want to stay in and do dinner/movie night together. She loves their gnocchi with cream sauce and I love their rigatoni with mushrooms and sausage in roasted pepper cream sauce. Each entree comes with salad/soup and bread.  I want to try their pizza one day too, since I've heard many good things about it. Definitely give this one a try.",

    "text": "To start, they bring you out fresh baked bread with garlic and olive oil for dipping - our bread was slightly undercooked but it is by far the best bread we've been served at a restaurant in Vegas so far.  We got the Sicilian Eggplant Appetizer - definitely a PASS.  Terribly mushy and nothing like delicious Sicilian eggplant we've had in the past.  The salad that came with my dinner was a large helping and good.  For entrees, I got the Chicken Angelo and my husband got a personal size pepperoni and pepper pizza.  Both were VERY good.  My chicken was tender and the wine sauce was delicious.  My husband's pizza was thin, crispy and cooked perfectly.  The rating really goes down a star because of the service.  The kitchen was almost chaotic and there weren't many people in the restaurant yet.  We could hear the chef in the back BEATING the heck out of my chicken - it was very loud, went on for quite a while and made it a little awkward in the dining area for the patrons trying to carry on conversations.  My dinner came out not too long after the beating stopped, so that's how we deciphered it was actually my chicken (which was very good, but my goodness!).  My dinner also came out long before my husband's and we could see the waiter standing by the oven cooking the pizza.  I guess because we ordered such different items it happened that way?  The other 2 tables in the restaurant both had their orders screwed up.  One table behind us had their food come out immediately after they were brought their salad - they were at a small 2-person table that only fits 1 dish each so they immediately handed up their salads and said, \"I guess we won't be needing these anymore!\"  Also, as a final note, the ambience is a little overdone.  At first, it seems like a nice dimly lit place but then when you try to read the menu, it's pretty ridiculous.  The menu you see on their website is the same menu they give you in print - a fancy designed tan background with somewhat small print.  We both found it REALLY hard to read in the dim light and we both have perfect reading vision.  Overall, it was OK but we won't be back with so many other choices for Italian food in the area.",

The sauce was extremely sour and tasted worse than grocery store pasta sauce. My husband had the pleasure of being served linguine del mar with three unopened mussel shells. After pointing this out to the server, he said sorry and quickly rushed off. There was no offer to redo the dish, to bring up mussels that are actually open or to offer a discount of some sort.   I'm appalled that the cook either didn't notice the defective mussels or just didn't care. I'm even more appalled that we were expected to pay full price for a dish that did not deliver what was promised.  The only memorable things that I will take away from this restaurant are the poor customer service and boring food.",

We waited in the front by where they make pizzas and that was interesting to watch - also looked delish.  We got the last table in the back which was very cozy, warm bread with olive oil and vinegar to dip,  Waiter Dave Z was delightful and joked with us throughout the meal, as well as being very attentive.  Wine all around - now we were set to read the menu.  I had the Chef's signature eggplant and it was outstanding.  My husband had the penne pasta with broccoli and chicken, which was also excellent.  My friend had spaghetti with meatballs which was very good, too.  But my friend Coleen had the sausage and mushroom rigatoni which was out of this world.  All the portions were heaping and I was amazed to see her all but finish it - I have NEVER seen her eat that much!!  She's an awesome cook in her own right and could not stop saying how incredible this dish was.  The owner came over and shared some of his thoughts and stories about his business - this was truly like having dinner with an extended family.  We are sad that this place is over 2 hours from home but we plan to stop in each time we have to visit Vegas.  Had no room for cannoli so we took one home and shared it for breakfast.  Yummmmmmm.  Here's the hard part - I easily give this place 5 stars and that's uncommon for me.  Usually something about the restaurant turns me off or isn't what I thought it should be.  Not Buon Gusto.  And if I give it 5 stars then I'll have a longer wait next time I go because all of you want to try it, too.  Hmmmmm.  My karma would be all FUBAR if I gave this place anything less than a five - so have at it!",

The service is slow, but what do you expect during rush hour. The decor is so so very New York I'd assume. The bathroom is a bit scary, but the food makes up for it. The bread is delicious and fresh, especially when dipped in the garlic balsamic olive oil. My 4 year old always gets the pizza which is made fresh, my 11 year old gets the cheese raviolli, baked spahgetti they are both smothered in soft gooey mozzarella cheese. I like the clam linguine with red sauce, very yummy!  Remember service is very slow, so be patient, and that's the only reason they didn't receive 5 stars from me. When you get you check at the end they bring you tootsie rolls, my little boy goes crazy for it. Me and my two boys are fans of this place, my husband's never been. My 4 year old has been saving his allowance money so he can take his daddy to dinner here for father's day. That's how good this place is. :)",

How much trouble can you cause in forty five minutes, honestly? Regardless, the food is great, but the incredibly friendly owner (who is present everyday) and the small style of the restaurant give the oterhwise typical Italian/pizza joint distinction. Steve is the big guy who is always around, and willing to chat up a storm in his thick New York accent and on occasion is known to offer free desserts. The pizza is crispy and cheesy, not like the overly doughy chains that surround Buon Gusto. The lunch special, if it's still offered is two slices a drink and a salad for around six bucks. Pretty good deal for lunch on the go! If you have the extra time, you can take a seat in the back and have a server bring your food out, but it seems silly when you can just yell \"Hey Steve, I'll have the special!\" Buon Gusto is student friendly, family friendly, and overall friendly, and if you go more than once, I almost guarantee they'll remember your name and treat you like a regular.  Recommended pizza: Cheese. It is so good, it doesn't need any toppings. Get a Caesar salad too if you plan on sitting and hanging out.",

Just sticking to pasta this time. To put my ranking into perspective... a chain like olive garden would get a 1-2 star from me. So they were better then the pasta co's, littering our nation.

Yes, stories of me yakking the first time I had pizza were legendary and told at many a family reunion. SIGH.

The crust was perfect - slightly crispy on the outside but soft when you broke into it; fresh toppings (especially those shrimp, which I think were cooked in garlic before they were added to the pie -- YUM); and the sauce-to-everything else ratio was perfect: not too much to overwhelm, but not too little to get lost in the sea of toppings. On the night we stopped by this cozy resto, it was filled to the brim, with a few folks waiting outside for a table. There's a reason to wait, folks: these pies are all that...",

We ordered ahead of time and took the food home, so I can't comment on the speed of their service when you come in and sit down, but we called fifteen minutes before they closed, and they were super nice about taking our order and helping us, which can be pretty rare when people are getting ready to close and looking forward to going home.  A lot of the time when you order to go, the food is cold and not very good by the time you get home, but ours was delicious.  Helpful, cheerful staff, yummy food, and great service?  I'll be back.",

    "text": "Most residents of Vegas wonder why anyone would ever eat out for Italian food.  Can you blame them?  The general impression is that  Vegas only has ridiculously expensive Italian restaurants on the strip and corporate Italian for the locals.  And the sauce at an Olive Garden or Macaroni Grill is only 1/2 a step up from the flavors found in a jar of pasta sauce at the grocery store.    But look deeper my friend.  Just like the U.S. is a melting pot of international cultures, Vegas is a melting pot of relocated American cultures.  And one of those great culinary cultures is Italian-American.    Buon Gusto is the classic east coast Italian restaurant.  It's cozy.  It's simple.  The menu items are delicious.  At it's best, Italian food consists of simple flavors.  But a great Italian cook knows that when those flavors come from fresh, quality produce and ingredients, there are few cuisines on the planet that can match Italian food.  Buon Gusto's pizza will cause you to over eat.  The crust is tasty and crispy, but not paper thin.  The sauce is just sweet enough without losing the tomato flavors and the options of fresh toppings are vast.  Our first time there, we had the veggie pizza and left with extra inches on our waists because we just couldn't stop eating it.  The next time we went, we had the Napa Valley White Pizza (white pizza with artichokes, tomatoes, onions. etc) and the Eggplant Pesto Pizza (white pizza with eggplant, roasted red peppers and tomatoes).  Even the pizzas without sauce are killer.   But that's just the pizza.  The pasta is equally outstanding.  The sauces make the dish and Buon Gusto makes their sauces fresh daily.  We had the Vodka cream sauce and the marinara and both were rich and so tasty that we kept sopping our bread in the sauce after the pasta was gone.    I'll admit that I was one of those people that spent most of my life wondering why people would order out for Italian.  Buon Gusto is the answer.  A marinara sauce may be simple, but when it's made fresh that day, by people who care about its quality, it's amazing.  Just writing this review makes me want to drive across town and have dinner there.",

My wife's Broccoli Penne was great no complaints, the Buon gusto however was just a little better than average which was kind of surprising since its named after the place.

    "text": "Why oh why can ONLY 5 stars be given????? Buon Gusto is the most amazing little gem in this city full of corporate sell outs and manufactured poor quality slop that other places try to pass off as edible.   The food itself could earn 5 stars, the service and the staff, all are worthy of their own 5 star rating. I discovered this place during my pregnancy and I fell in love. For those of you that aren't aware, serving disgusting food to a pregnant woman is grounds to get your innards pulled out and handed to you. That night we had ordered take out from another Italian chain just down the road and they screwed up my chicken piccatta. So after tears, and brow beating my poor hubby we threw that in the trash and ventured out for one of my crazy cravings for that hour. Note to any good husbands who have been on the receiving end of such hormonal upheaval, it will cease and the monster who has possessed your wife will be evicted shortly after the baby is born. There is hope.   Enter Buon Gusto, the heroes who may very well have saved Hubby's life and sanity at least for one evening. We walked in and the smell alone was worth bottling and selling. Whilst in the throes of pregnancy, smell and taste can either make or break your entire day. This my friends, made it. Oh Chicken Parmesan Sandwich how you changed my life, that very night. It was pretty much a religious awakening. Of course being the dainty, figure conscious little thing I am, I devoured my food and demanded to try Hubby's and my older son's as well. Heaven.   This food could end wars, restore virginity, right all wrongs, find the Lindburg Baby, solve the Mystery of The Bermuda Triangle and . . . . . . . . be the mitigating factor in solving the National Deficit.   Please go in and be prepared to be treated like family, eat with good people and most of all leave with a sense that your money wasn't wasted here.   The only thing that they could possibly do to make it better you ask?????? Come to my house and cook, okay and do the dishes after =)",

We eventually got our salads over an hour in to the torture, and our food another half hour later. The food was mediocre, over-sauced and not terribly flavorful. The waiter was constantly apologizing for 'The wait\" at each stage of the waiting game, and thanking us for our patience -- but would do nothing about the fact that we had to continue using way too much of it. We should indeed have walked out earlier -- at least between being seated and ignored -- because the food and horrible service were NOT worth the wait.",

The gnocchi itself was tender and clearly home made, but the sauce tasted more like a cheese sauce than a tomato Vodka.  The Chicken Trieste consists of thin sauteed chicken breasts in a red wine sauce with mushrooms and artichokes. Your order comes with a side of penne pasta, perfect for the extra sauce with the chicken. The complimentary bread is delicious, pairing well with all of the various dishes.

I was expecting some spices on there such as oregano basil salt pepper so there went half the flavor. I didn't feel the love with the cheese. I only like regular mozzerella, not low-fat.

    "text": "Well, needless to say we were excited to get a new restaurant near our home.  I think eating in you get better service as my first experience required I return as they forgot the pasta with my entree. Second time we ate inside and it was better. Service was a little slow. But quality was better. We decided to try takeout again. I ordered the Mediterranean salad as it was pretty good when we ate there. This time however all I got was 2 containers of Romain with a couple of tomatoes and very little shake cheese on top. Not even close to the salad the week before. Pizza was burned on one side. For the price, this meal was 30.00 I think I will go down the hill to Joeys pizza.. 3 strikes and your out. Very disappointed",

We were on our way tonight and called at 8:35 to place our order over the phone so it would be ready when we got to the restaurant and lo and behold, the person who answered the phone said that \"It was slow, so we closed.\" REALLY? I asked to speak with the boss who was not there and I told the worker that the web site said 9:00. He said, the last customer left at 7:45 so they decided to close. He told me that he would change the time on the web site. REALLY? Since when do the employees determine business hours? Buddy, if the boss pays you for a full day, you should stay till 9:00. The \"Boss\" should do more checking up on his workers. I don't care how the food tastes, that is pretty poor service I never got! Used to be a good place....now, not so much!!! Time for a new crew!",

Just before the main course was served we asked if there was supposed to be any bread served and the server said she forgot to bring it.  If the food had been decent the price would have been great.

The cook was very young and was being instructed by a nice woman (the owner) who was getting my order together. She was very nice just a bit overwhelmed. I was just happy I didn't dine in. The dinner portions were very small for the price. The food tasted good. Loved the sauce lots of garlic. It tasted great on the New York cheese pizza. I don't mind paying more as long as there are left overs for the morning. This was not the case here. They need to make larger portions or lower their prices. Also hire more people.",

I had the eggplant and could have used more meat but loved its cheesiness.  Bread was delicious.  White pizza with basil and broccoli could have used some of my cheese. Crust is thin and with the bread so delicious probably would have been tastier with a thicker crust.  Wouldn't make a special effort to return but if in the neighborhood I may stop in.",

They are regulars and said we'd love the food; they were right.  We were greeted warmly and informed that the food would take a bit longer due to a large catering order that the kitchen was also cooking.  No matter since it didn't seem like much of a delay at all.  We enjoyed bread, dinner salads, and conversation before our main courses arrived.  I had the chicken marsala and it was a generous helping of three pieces of moist chicken with a very tasty sauce and lots of mushrooms; I highly recommend this dish!  Believe it or not, I didn't have any pasta, but my friend's spaghetti and meatballs looked delicious.  I love little hole-in-the-wall places like this over a chain restaurant any day. The service is friendly and the food is good. PS-our friends are having Buon Gusto cater their wedding reception, which means I get more chicken marsala tonight--grazie!",

After we sat down, it took a good twenty minutes before our order was taken and another ten minutes before we got our drinks. My father-in-law had to order three different entrees because the waitress kept coming back telling us they were sold out of everything he tried to order. I ordered the whole wheat pasta; I wouldn't have minded paying the extra $3 had I not seen the cook walk to the storage room and grab a grocery store box of whole wheat spaghetti. After about 40 minute of waiting, we asked our waitress if we could have our salads. Apparently she had forgotten that she didn't bring them to us. About an hour and half in, our food came, but not mine. It took another ten minutes before my store bought pasta was cooked. Overall, our food was extremely disappointing.   I don't know what show on Food Network they were on, but if you said Worst Cooks in America, I'd believe you.   Unless you need to waste two hours and a decent amount of money on crappy food, skip this place.",

It's a very casual setting, kinda like a pizzeria back east, with the red and white checkered table cloths and all. As soon as we walked in we were told to sit anywhere and the server took our drink orders right away.   I ordered the chicken francese with a side of penne with marinara sauce. My meal came with a small salad to start which was really good. The chicken was rather delicious just the right amount of lemon flavor in it, not to much. I thought the size was small, looked like a chicken breast pounded out and cut into 4 pieces. I scarfed it down rather fast then worked on the side of penne which tasted perfect, if you ask for bread they will bring it to you to scoop up any leftover sauce.   My only complaint is that IMO it's not worth what they charge, it's not fine dining. $15.95 for my meal and they charge an extra $2.95 for the side of pasta, pasta is customarily included with the meal at Italian restaurants. Don't like the nickel and diming. If the lunch portion was this much I wonder how much the dinner portion is. Not stingy so just saying.   Other than the quantity and price the food was still good and the service was equally good to. Servers were very friendly and kept checking out table for refills. I will definitely give this place another chance, maybe the portions are better at dinner. I wasn't full when I left.",

Pros:   The party napkins were a nice shade of red that appealed to the eyes.   Cons:  Service Dining Experience  Soup was terrible and cold My mom makes better meatballs and she's a vegetarian  Food order was completely wrong  Restaurant doesn't know the difference between ziti and penne  Total lack of knowledge from staff Low quality taste in food   So many more negative thoughts on this place. Just want the owners to know they ruined a much needed family dinner, and that I will never be coming back nor recommend this place to anyone.",

I can't find Chicken Francese anywhere, and this place always made it so good, along with the Alfredo sauce. I've never dined in, always ordered togo which took 45 minutes each time. That's fine, I don't mind the wait considering how delicious the food WAS.  I ordered  $60 of food to go. None of it was even... ok. The chicken francese tasted old and not how it's supposed to. I don't know what was put on top... garlic...? But it was crunchy. The Penne Alfredo had absolutely no alfredo... and whatever was put in there had no taste. Our togo order was wrong too.  There must have been a change considering the other bad reviews. Sad that I now have to say my goodbyes to this place.",

I don't mind waiting an exorbitant amount of time for my food if it's going to be fabulous, but this was certainly not the case! We waited almost an hour for salads, with tasteless dressing and all lettuce, the cheese pizza was just ok (nothing to write home about), the vegetarian pizza was improperly made and and after an hour and a half you would think it would come out right? We ordered a kids pasta Alfredo that we had to ask 3 different servers for and it was the last item brought to the table! Kids dishes should be served first not last - after 1 hour and 30 minutes!  This is a mistake never to be repeated!",

The upside The food was great, the crab cakes were right on, they are homemade and delicious.The eggplant was cooked perfectly with plenty of cheese.  The downside When I got home and opened the boxes, I noticed the Penne Marinara included in the menu description was missing. Apparently if you dine-in, you do get a side of Penne marinara. If you get your order to go, you do not get the Penne Marinara. I called to ask about this and I was told it was because of the cost of the \"To Go\" box.So that leads me to a question, if you dine in and can't finish, do they charge you extra for the \"to go\" box then? I felt very disappointed about this and might not go back there because of it. Little things can make a big impression.",

Wanting to avoid the strip and other crowded establishments I consulted Yelp to find some recommendations. After pouring over the dozens of recommendations we finally decided on this one and could not have been happier! It is a darling little Italian restaurant in a local strip mall and was very clean and welcoming. Our waitress was a young girl- I didn't get her name, but she was AWESOME!! Upon hearing it was our first visit- she went out of her way to explain the menu and give us options that were better than being at home! My husband wanted a very specialized plate that wasn't on the menu and she didn't bat an eye, said it was no problem at all! The food arrived and was absolutely as close to home made as you could ever hope to get! It was the most delicious Italian food I've ever tasted!  I'm not sure if I'll ever tagalong again, but if I do, you can bet that will be revisiting this place again!!! I highly, highly recommend!",

    "text": "I've tried a few tasty dishes via coworkers (garlic and oil linguine with clams, delicious, sausage rigatoni, yum, and chicken tenders with fries, equally delicious!) and was convinced to visit when I had a hankering for some pasta. I was just ordering take out, but admired the dining area while I was there. Very cozy. Definitely unexpected for a spot in a shopping center. I ordered the baked spaghetti and a side of their housemade meatball. The baked spaghetti was not what I expected. The portion was very generous, but so was the very overwhelming mozzarella cheese that was \"baked\" on top. I attempted to scrap off as much cheese as I could to make it bearable. The spaghetti was good though and the meatball was great! It also came with a side salad that I thought was wondeful. Especially with the marinated artichoke, peppercinis, and their amazing ranch dressing (seriously, THAT is how ranch should taste!) So my first experience wasn't fantastic, but I blame it on my ordering a dud since I've had other pastas from there that I thought were great. Will have to give it another whirl! They have wonderful lunch specials and overall, the prices are decent for the amount of food.  Edit: I had to bump them up a star for their PIZZA! Wowza. I'm not a cheese pizza kind of gal because it's way too boring and the cheese can be too much (at least the way most people make it). However, my New Yorker friend, who constantly vouched for this pizza, told me that the cheese was the way to go. So, I had to follow suit. We ordered a whole pie, so it was fresh and hot. I have one word for it, heavenly. Pizza perfection (disclaimer: I love thinner crust!). There was a nice, light crunch from the bottom of the pizza, the soft and thin layer of dough, sauce, and cheese. No flavor was overwhelming except the sweet harmony of these three things. The crust was still dough-y, but had a nice texture to it. I love being able to fold my pizza slice in half too. Oh, it is just so GOOD! After that first experience, I had their pizza three times within a few weeks. Every time, it didn't disappoint. There's not very many places that I drool over pizza, but this is one of them!!",

Buon Gusto is like your typical Italian eatery in New York.  Looked much like a pizzeria, however, with a dining room that extended a bit back.  The wait was not bad and when we were seated - the servers were attentive.  I ordered the Gnocchi w Tomato Cream sauce and Geo had the Chicken Alfredo. Wow! Both dishes were fantastic!  We also had the Antipasto for an appetizer - too much food for me as a salad came with our meal.  Still, I have to say that it was so fresh that I did not mind eating salad twice.   With all the great choices on the menu from hot sandwiches to perfect pastas to fish entrees... we will definitely be back!  Next time we want to try their lunch specials.  The flavorful food compensates for the lack of pizzazz you would normally seek in a restaurant outing.  We are grateful to have found a great local spot!  I will highly recommend that you come and try it out even if you do not live in Henderson.  I am sure that Dominic, the owner, would love to have ya!   Buona Salute!  your constant companion,  ~deirdra",

Over the past six years I have eaten at so many Italian restaurants out here and somehow this little cafe evaded me. On a chance encounter (I was going to try another joint called \"Bratalian\" a block away but they had closed for dinner) I found this place thanks to Yelp and boy was I impressed.   To start I ordered a Calamari appetizer which was second to none as I order Calamari everywhere that has it. I then had a slice of cheese pizza which was superb, and the salad was very fresh with some black olives, a slice of artichoke heart, and a pepper. I also tried the Penne e Broccoli Chicken, a noodle, chicken, and broccoli dish as the name implies.   I paid maybe twenty-five dollars and took home most of the entree as I was completely stuffed. For the prices this is the best Italian food you can find in Vegas in my honest opinion. Two can dine here for under thirty dollars tip included and still take some food home.   Keep this place at 5 stars please as it deserves it!",

Make a reservation, alot of regulars go here...  Best calamari I've ever had and the owner is so friendly and interacts with the customers. Chicken Francaise (sp?) is \"heavenly\"!! Caesar dressing is authentic, which is hard to find-- (no brainer right?) Buon Gusto does everything right!!",

We waited an hour and a half to have our entrees come out looking nothing like what I was used to. The Chicken Francese  came out all mixed together and they put red sauce on it. The sausage on my Dates plate was ground sausage ....which would have never left the kitchen before!  I'm only giving one star because the Drinks were cold and refilled. Saying sorry for the delay and blaming it on staff not showing up only goes so far.....",

    "text": "I would never have found this place if my wife hadn't been craving Calamari.  We figured that if we were getting some apps we should go to a place we had never been. She started looking at Italian restaurants that were semi-close to where we live and Buon Gusto popped up.  The reviews were great so we headed on over.   I have driven past this restaurant a number of times and have never seen it.  This place is pretty nice.  It's very small, warm, and welcoming.  The Calamari was very lightly breaded and had the right amount of salt for seasoning.  My wife loved it and even though I'm not the biggest fan, I thought it was pretty great as well.  My wife ordered the Manicotti and it was some of the best I've ever had.  I had the Sicilian Style Eggplant which is baked and topped with Mozzerella cheese.  It was very good and there was a lot of it.  The waitress was great and the timing of the appetizer, salads, and entrees was perfect.  The owner was in the kitchen making pizzas and he was fun to watch and listen to.  I do wish that the food was a couple dollars cheaper for each entree but that won't stop me from going again.",

First off as many people have stated, the service is slooooowwww and the time it takes your food to get out is slooooooowwwweeeeerrrrr.  It took forever.  Secondly, I disagree with people's comments that the portions are large.  We all found them to be rather small for the price.  My girlfriend had the Chef's eggplant parm, my friend had lasagna and I had chicken franchese.  My chicken came out on a huge plate with what amounted to about 3 chicken fingers worth of meat.  Not worth $16 or $17 for the plate.  It was a $63 bill before tip for three people where no alcohol was purchased and there was only one soda bought.  That is a bit stiff for pretty good food but average amounts of it.",

My husband (who is on a low carb plan for eating) had their low carb special with grilled sausage and onions with peppers.  He loved it!  My kids had pizza and thought it was fine.  I tasted the pizza and it was better than average...  The prices were fair, and the quality was superb.  This is my new favorite neighborhood spot for sure.  Next time I will try one of their gourmet pizzas.  The bread that came with my lasagna was delicious.  I wondered if it was the same dough for the pizza.  Thanks!!!",

    "text": "I used to eat here pretty regularly when the past owners were here.  The food was always absolutely wonderful.  Coming from an Italian family I can say this was the best.  We were greeted and seated quickly and the waitress was very nice.  The new owners (who say they are the original owners) stated they didn't change any of the original recipes.  Well, they should have kept the past owners recipes!  The Alfredo sauce tasted like a white sauce.  No Parmesan cheese to it at all.  She asked me if I wanted some \"fresh grated Parmesan\"; it had no flavor.  The ranch dressing was disappointing because the pasted owners had a touch of garlic to the ranch dressing, this was very bland ranch and too much of it.  The pizza that I use to LOVE is gone as well.  The crust was burnt and very little topping.  Their bruschetta is not what I know as bruschetta!  The bread is not toasted and it is smothered in cheese.  Very little tomato and basil.  The couple next to us were complaining about the pink sauce being sour and the spaghetti and meatballs was too dry.  It looked dry to me.  The desert was a let down also.  The current owners have made my favorite restaurant Ho, Hum or worse.  The fancy menus don't cut it.  I'll take the paper menus and much better food.  Until the people in the link below come back,  I won't be back.

This, in my opinion, is a must in any Italian restaurant.  So kudos to the owners for creating such a warm and inviting atmosphere.  Dinner menu is a bit pricey, but the crisp cold salads, piping hot delicious bread, and large portion sizes more than make up for it.  Oh and by the way, fight the temptation to dig right in for just a few seconds for fear of burning your tongue, because all the entrees come out hot!  Maybe the portion sizes could be cut to accommodate a better price point?  But, that's just me thinking aloud, I guess that's what their lunch/take-out menu is there for.  Overall I'd highly recommend Buon Gusto to anyone who enjoys a great Italian meal with plenty of left overs!  =^)",

    "text": "I took my girlfriend to Buon Gusto before ice skating at the Venetian and we had a wonderful, memorable experience.  We were seated next to the kitchen in a very small two-top with the same table about 8 inches to our right. While the seating was less than awesome, the staff was fabulous. Our waitress greeted us, seated us and impressed us for the rest of the night. She was knowledgeable of the menu and their ingredients as I'm vegetarian and my girlfriend is a hard core meatatarian. I ordered their signature eggplant and she ordered the special, salmon and shrimp. While we chatted and waited for our meal, generous free bread servings (with olive oil and vinegar!) and salads with homemade ranch assuaged our hunger.   But then, a gentleman dining alone was seated next to us. While it seemed awkward at first, the close proximity of our table brought us to talk to the man, who owns Bread and Butter, a local breakfast and bakery we'll visit soon. He makes their bread, fresh, and trades it for a bowl of pasta once a week. Think about that. These businesses have such a friendly relationship, they just trade food for food. That is exactly the kind of good hearted folks who work here. While it was funny to listen to the kitchen chatter while we were waiting, I could see how some people would find it distracting or unpleasant. Though, BOTH owners came to visit with us, check on the quality of our meal, and ask about our Thanksgivings.  The environment at Buon Gusto is warm and inviting. My girlfriend put it best, \"I feel like I'm in my Italian mother's house, but I'm not Italian!\" Go there. Do it now. You will not regret it.",
