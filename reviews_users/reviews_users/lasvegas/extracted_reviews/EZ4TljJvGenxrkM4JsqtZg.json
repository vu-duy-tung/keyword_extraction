In LA you'd pay at least $12.95 for a bento like this and you'd be lucky to get anything close to the same quality.  And their chirashi sushi is a work of art.  Fresh and delicious!  See the uploaded photos.  Friendly, attentive service.  We see the owner every time we're there and he always stops by the table to say hello.",

Half the time i let the staff decide some new sushi to me and they always come up with something tasteful. Honestly the only thing better than the food is the SERVICE, Mel might be the best server in this place if not the best server in all of Las Vegas! Crystal and Nancy are also great. You can not go wrong with any of the servers or the chefs. They are all really friendly and accommodating. I really can not say anything wrong about this place except for the fact i don't go there quit enough. i don't know if there is another sushi place in the area,but at this point it  doesn't matter because thanks to Mel and the rest of the staff who are all so friendly this is the only sushi spot i will come to. The owners of the establishment should be very grateful for the staff they have working there in all areas. A++",

Except that the food is mediocre.  I've eaten at Sushi-ko twice.  Both times the service was great.  The first time I had what was supposed to be Yaki Noodles with Chicken.  They served me LO MEIN with Chicken.  Uh, okay.  It was slightly greasy and I ate about a third of it before passing on the rest.  The second time I was going to a little get-together and decided to surprise everyone with Chirashi, (an arrangement on a rice bowl using various cuts of sushi.)  I phoned in for pick-up and gave them the benefit of the doubt that maybe the sushi bar is great and the kitchen is just so-so.  After paying a bit more than I wanted, I opened up the Chirashi box and it was TINY and uninspiring.  One piece of octopus?  Two pieces of Tuna?  Really?    I really wanted to like this place, considering the walking proximity they were to me.  But with two sub-par experiences, I'll reserve my sushi cravings for Hokkaido or Ichiza.",

Normally I dont expect much from service out here in vegas. Everyone is usually so fast paced and FAKE. Not the case here! I received real genuine service from this sweet young Asian girl. She was very attentive with my refills,  and took the time to help me decide on my selection of rolls, told her I was a big salmon fan. Oh boy! The salmon somthing roll she brought back was so savory! She even hooked it up with some garlic ponzu sauce on the side, way way TASTEIR than over powering soy sauce. Thanks for the grub n service guys!",

No, this is not your traditional Japanese place, and I'd like to think Ive had a lot of authentic Japanese cuisine.  But I would be stupid to compare Sushi-Ko to a \"traditional\" place.    (This is a response to the disgruntled reviewer below who was looking for yakisoba and gyoza... HELLO- did you try ANY of their fabulous rolls?? oops....sorry, I think I inadvertently called you stupid. )   Sushi Ko is great in that its food is completely NOT traditional.  Its edgy, new, and enlightens my tastebuds.     A lot of similar nouveau places in California (Ive mentioned this in an another review) TRY to do this, but the execution is poor and sloppy -- as in they just slather rolls with mayo+sriracha and charge you 14 bucks.  This is NOT how Sushi Ko does it. Their sauces are unlike anything Ive tried and the combinations of flavors are delightful.  And the fish freshness on west coast standards was excellent.   I know its a bit of a trudge from the strip, but if you are anywhere out there, go to Sushi Ko. Ask what kind of rolls they recommend.   It will be good.",

I immediately called the business and was informed that plastic is used to cut the rolls and I could receive a refund if I returned by 11pm close of business. I arrived at 11:01 and was told I could not receive a refund because it was 11:01 and the register closed at eleven. I accepted that because it was my fault for not getting there on time. I was told to return the next day and I would receive a refund. I returned the next day driving another 25mins from my home to be told I was not getting a refund because I did not bring the  food back. I was never told by the three people o spoke with prior to bring the food back. The owner got on the phone and completely disregarded what his waitresses told me. I will NEVER eat here again and I don't recommend anyone else since this establishment believes it's okay to put plastic in people's food and then not keep their word. HORRIBLE!",

Ive been here a good 5-8 times since I found out about this place from a friend that lives there.   The sushi is ALWAYS amazing, never fishy. The garlic sashimi, jalapeno sashimi, and something orgasm sashimi are hands down the best I've ever had. The sake is decently priced and the last time I went there it was 20% off all sashimi, 70 bucks for 3 people in including sake, and beers.   All in all, if ever visiting Vegas take a trip to the north side and stop by this place, you wont be disappointed.",

Tepanyaki to me is about showmanship at the table and not necessarily the quality of the quality of the food (although it should not complete garbage...). Here basically the showmanship was lacking.   The chef was completely uninteractive and the fanciest thing I saw wad a grease fired on the table. And not even in an onion volcano. Don't get Tepanyaki here. There are better places",

We made a reservation on Tuesday to use a Groupon for the hibachi on Wednesday. When we arrived, we were seated right away at a hibachi grill by ourselves. Turns out the young lady who took our reservation the previous day, forgot to write it down but kudos to them for not turning us away. On to the food. The hibachi deal included miso soup and salad. The soup was very tasty. The salad was good but the ginger sesame dressing was different from the other places I have visited. Not bad, just different. I did not enjoy it as much but my husband did. Then the hibachi chef arrived. I got my phone out and was ready to Snapchat all the fancy knife moves and shrimp tossing but alas, was disappointed. He literally just cooked the food in front of us. Nothing fancy. No onion volcano. No rice in the shape of a heart. No eggs being tossed up in the air. Nada. However, once the food was on our plate, he did pull out these wooden fire torch things and did a mini fire baton show. After which he proceeded to THOROUGHLY clean the grill while we ate. The food. I had the Ribeye, my husband had the NY steak and Shrimp. Everything was DELICIOUS! There were 2 dipping sauces, 1 mustard, 1 ginger, both were tasty. The rice was very flavorful, everything was cooked perfectly. I guess what they lack in flair they made up for in flavor!",

I only had 1 shot since I had to drive. The miso soup, the salad, the NY steak, the shrimp, the fried rice, and the vegetables were very delicious. Ton was our chef and he was very polite and fast. Other hibachi places put on a little show while they cook your dinner but this one does not. We ordered the Banana Harumaki for dessert and it was very good. It was worth it for the price of the groupon. If you want tasty food, good portions, and exceptional service this is the place for you.

    "text": "I'm only giving it 2 stars, because the girl who took care of us was nice and the food was good. My party of four came in at dinner time on a Monday night. The restaurant is small (maybe 9-10 tables, the sushi bar, and two huge hibachi tables). We had a Groupon and there seemed to be some debate amongst the two working the floor regarding what that entailed. From what I could gather, there was one server, one sushi chef, and one manager. The manager ended up serving us.   We finally got the Groupon menu and placed our order: four orders of nigiri, a Lemon roll, a Japanese Lasagna, a Jessica roll, a soft shell crab hand roll, a Spider roll, and a Philadelphia roll. We were supposed to also get fried rice and oysters (the girl was going to give us the oysters since we waited so long) but we never got either during the meal. I think the other two in our party ended up taking the rice home. The food was good, not the best sushi I've ever had, but definitely not even remotely bad. The Lemon roll in particular was great.   We also got some of the sake. We had the white peach and the cherry. They weren't very potent, but that was good because they were delicious and I would've gotten trashed if they were strong.   Now, for the issues. They were ridiculously understaffed. I get it, honestly I do, but it was outrageous how two people and one chef had to take care of a full restaurant.  Another point to make is that we didn't even get the right nigiri; we ordered one unagi, but instead got double salmon. While I like salmon and had ordered one, my boyfriend was a little put out. At that point, however, we were to hungry to argue. The woman who took care of us was very sweet and that wonderful attitude never faltered, even though it was plain to see how much stress she was under.   We were there, in total, almost three hours. That wasn't due to us. As soon as we got the menu, we ordered everything within minutes. It just took forever for everything to come out. Since we didn't get the rice while dining, we didn't really fill up.   I'm not sure if we'll be coming back. My boyfriend and I live on the other side of town and it's not worth the drive. The other two in our party might, for take out at least. I wasn't kidding about how great that Lemon roll was. The food was spectacular, but management needs to schedule more people and/or hire more. If someone calls out, there needs to be more staff available to handle it.",

    "text": "My friends reviewed this place, so I guess I will, too. Frankly, I didn't think the resto was as amazing as my friends say it was. Was the service good? Yes. Was the food good? Yes. Are the prices ok? Yes. But the way my friends have been talking about it to me, you'd think they just witnessed the arrival of the last Messiah.  We didn't make a reservation or anything, just walked in. From the looks of it, only the teppanyaki table really needs reservations, anyways. There were still two tables open and plenty of seats at the sushi bar on a Friday night. The server in the front was quick to say hi and told us we could sit down wherever we want to. We sat towards the corner so we could see the lively atmosphere and flames teppanyaki grill. There are a couple of TVs around the room, so people don't get bored. It's probably a good thing too, if sports are playing.  I'm not really a big fan of fresh fish, so I ordered the pork belly bowl for myself. That's one of the plus points about this place. It has plenty of options for people who don't like sushi. The food was pretty good. It came in a timely manner and looked appetizing. The pork belly tasted juicy and included rice, so that was good.  We purchased a groupon deal online before we checked out. The paying process was simple enough, and they do split checks, but then it gets complicated with the discount, so I recommend just paying it all on one bill and figuring it out after.  Altogether, I liked this place, and I would probably go back if my friends want to eat sushi again.",

Maybe I ordered the wrong rolls or maybe I just didn't get a bunch of beer and excuse the poor service.  We ordered take-away baby lobster roll and the spicy spider roll. Both tasted ok, but nothing to write home about.  Here's my issues :  The baby lobster roll is made with crayfish, not lobster.  I'm sorry, crayfish is NOT baby lobster.  It's a completely different shellfish with a very different flavor.  I was not impressed.  The spicy spider roll was in fact spicy, but it didn't have deep fried soft shell crab, it had imitation crab! If I'm going to be paying 30 dollars for two sushi rolls, I want them to be the real deal, not cheap and bad-tasting imitations.  There was one little deep fried crab claw sticking out to fool me into believing that there was real crab in the rest of the roll, but I pulled them apart and found no other crab.  What I did find, however, was raw chunks of carrot and yellow bell pepper, which was kind of unappetizing.  It really threw off the flavor of the sushi.    The worst part was that we got take away because we left our new baby at home, and we sat there waiting for our food for an HOUR.  This was so disappointing.    On the plus side, the people getting teppanyaki looked like they were having a great time.",

I usually order the 101 Degree and it has been near perfect every time. My daughter celebrated her 16th birthday at their teppanyaki grill and it was fabulous. Someone else mentioned seeing roaches??? That is extremely hard to believe. I used to frequent Sushiko every day at lunch as I owned a business in the same shopping center. Now I pass 2 or 3 sushi places just to get to Sushiko. In all the years I've gone there I have NEVER EVER seen a roach. The place is always clean and welcoming.",

    "text": "The sushi and other a la carte dishes taste wonderful. The service is okay. The only issue I have with this restaurant is the Habachi Grill. I ended up with FOOD POISONING THE NEXT DAY. If I would, I'd resort to calling Legal Matters on this. But I am too nice. Read on....  My husband and I are accustom to the previous chef who would make our delicious food. This new chef is rather \"all over the place\". What I mean by that is, CROSS CONTAMINATION GALORE. Dear God. Sure the presentation was there, but the way he cooked and served the food was awful. The chicken and filet mignon were EXTREMELY SALTY. Hell he was playing around with the raw chicken. It was still pink and raw and he hovered it over a little girls plate. I mean seriously?? Does he not know that the RAW chicken juices can fall into that little girls plate? This is UNACCEPTABLE. HE even jokingly hovered the RAW meat over a woman's plate. She was taken back by it too because of the juices that spilled on her plate. She looked across from me and shook her head. I did the same as well. If you want better Habachi Service DO NOT GO HERE, I'm still suffering from my food poisoning (cramps, fever, shakes, nausea, and lots of vomiting). I also read from a post on 02-15-2015 that a man ordered their mussels for appetizer before the Habachi Cross Contamination Grill show. He states \"there was something wrong\" with them. Read the owners response. Sushi Ko: for the lack of a better phrase: get your current HABACHI GRILL cook fired.",

I want to give it more stars but the food wasn't unique.. it's not the most memorable food.  I usually go for sashimi and there was some listed but the menu focused more on rolls, tempura, and other things.  Overall it looks very well rounded but the couple things we ordered had very similar flavor profiles when their descriptions sounded very different.  One had siracha and was tempura fried and in ponzu while the other had siracha.  Also, anything listed as spicy is a lie.  I know most people would consider some things spicy that I might register as mild.. but anything listed as spicy here lacked heat.  It always feels like accidental False advertising whenever this happens.  Someone would have to be oversensitive and consider black pepper as super spicy to consider these items spicy.  Seriously, the people here are really cool, and if you're in the area looking for sushi in general this will do, the menu just doesn't stand out.",

    "text": "In all honesty I would leave one star if I could. This place had horrible service and the food was awful. Let me explain. I was in a group of four for hibachi dinner. We were asked to wait 20 so we could join a part of five. We agreed and sat down to wait. A few minutes later we sat at our table and started looking at the menus. Shortly after seven, four of the party of five showed up and got their menus. We got our soup and salad and it took an entire hour to start the actual meal. It seemed like we were waiting for the 5th person to show up even though they were well over an hour late. Then he started cooking the food and every single thing he cooked had at least an entire stick of butter on it. I have never experienced that much butter in food before. There was so much that we couldn't even finish your food because it was looked disgusting and the thought of eating it made our hearts hurt. So if you're looking to have a heart attack this is probably a good place to go. Otherwise just save your money it's not worth it.",

This left our food cooking on the table until it was completely burnt. Staff and management did nothing and just watched as we sat stunned at our table. When we realized they were not going to send another chef our way we decided to get up and leave, without having our dinner. The owner then ran over to us and exclaimed we must pay for food... that we didn't even get to eat... such a poor, poor experience and we will be taking our business (and $$) to other local Hibachi restaurants from now on.",

Walked in and the new server who spike English looked like she was coming off from a busy period. I walked in at 1pm. I commented oh another new server since the last time I was here....she responded it's new owners...I said I know I met the new young owner. The server was in the weeds. Food is still standard  and looks like they hired some new sushi chefs..if I need to travel farther for better grade sushi and service guess I have too cause it's not making my grade.",

    "text": "Sushiko was one of my favorites for several years but I must say, this place has gone downhill in a big way with the new ownership.  Tonight, I took a friend of mine there for dinner and as soon as we walked in, it was hot in there. I asked why it was so hot and the response I got was their A/C was out. OK, things happen, so we sit down and decide to ride it out.  So we order and after about 40-45 mins, we still have no food and the waiter tells us there's only 1 guy making sushi! I look around and there's quite a few people waiting, including a female who had obviously called in her order for pick up and she waited around an hour to get her dinner.  When our first item was brought to the table, it was the wrong thing! We ended up waiting another 20+ minutes, we finally started to get a roll here and there. At one point, the chef made something and the waitress was walking table to table, trying to figure out where it belonged.  Bottom line, don't waste your time at this place! It's gone downhill, No A/C, shortage of staff, long waits, staff is confused and the sushi certainly isn't worth that kind of wait and frustration! I'm done with this place and wanted to warn you. Go elsewhere and you'll be happy you did!",

    "text": "We have been loyal and sometimes even fanatical customers of Sushi Ko since 2007.  I took my now fiance here on our first date in 2013, and she and I started eating lunch here about twice a week.  Over the past couple months, we stopped eating out so much, including going to Sushi Ko.  But this weekend is the big day for moms, and my mom, who loves sushi, came to town to visit, so we took our parents to our favorite sushi restaurant!  I made reservations for seven and the six of us arrived, eyes big, stomachs empty, and ready to eat some of the best sushi on the West coast!  Instead, this night was an unbelievable trip down \"are you f'n kidding me\" lane and ended with us swearing off Sushi Ko, for life.  1.  I had made reservations for six and, they made us squeeze into an area set for five.  So asses to elbows, we proceeded to look over our menus.  Wait.  Where are the menus??  2.  Our waitress proceeded to yell at us OVER the grill for our orders.  And when that wasn't working, she leaned over the grill so far her apron was burning on the grill;  3.  No utensils, no napkins, no soy sauce, no wasabi, no dishes to mix and dip sushi;  4.  Waitstaff continually bumped into our chairs and banged into our arms trying to get between the back wall and those of us seated between the wall and grill;  5.  The hibachi chef clearly didn't understand that he needed to speak up and over the incredible noise of the exhaust fan at our grill;  And then, really downhill-  1.  Our steaks were cooked and served, at least what we thought were fresh, juicy, fantastically flavored steaks.  Nope.  Not sure what they were trying to pass off here, but tasted like what I would assume dog food would taste like;  2.  Chef missed one of us when dividing up the vegetables.  Instead he piled on the plate of an 8 year old girl with enough vegetables (and rice) to feed her for a week;  3.  Three of us could not eat the steak, and did not eat any of it past the initial bite;  4.  My fiance spoke with the manager and explained the problem with the steak and that it was inedible and if we could only have the steaks taken off the bill. She pointed out that the shrimp was on the menu and we would be willing to pay that price, essentially paying for the food we ate;  5.  When the manager returned with the bill, without a word or even a breath of apology, she threw the bill on table and walked off.  She had removed one meal.  My fiance went back to her, assuming there must be some misunderstanding, and was told, \"too bad, this is the way that it is.\"  6.  I went to manager and very calmly and very nicely asked her to explain her position as we did not intend to pay for the food in the three meals that we did not eat,  COULD NOT eat- and what we were willing to pay for, like the shrimp, was more than fair.  She said, \"Either pay for the meal or I am calling the police.\"  Pardon?   When and HOW did we jump from, \"hey we have a real concern about the quality of the food you are serving\" to \"I am calling the police.\" ???  How did she get her job as manager?  How does she still have a job?  In what reality is someone this rude hired as the MANAGER of a restaurant?  Instead of working with us and listening to our legitimate concerns, she threatens to call the police???  7.   We agreed to pay for the meal and our parents had decided that if that was the case, they would take the food home and do SOMETHING with it.  However, shortly after paying, I learned our table had been cleared, and when I inquired about the food and why it was cleared, I was told by the manager to \"Go F*CK myself.\"  I am sorry?  Say what?  Go F*CK myself??  Is she kidding me???  Again, how does someone this rude and possessing the IQ and mental ability of a sixth grader become manager of a restaurant?  This night will certainly rank as Most Unbelievable for quite some time.  Also, we will never eat at Sushi Ko again.  Oh, one more thing... my fiance threw up just outside the door and my mom is sick- both of them ate the steak.",

I couldn't even say that \"what you pay for is what you get\" because I paid $50 for a $20 experience. the issues within your establishment cause me to never want to go back again & that's whether you have 1 star or 5. to all customers: I would say go for yourselves and make your own opinions, but honestly just save your time and money.",

Let me start by saying that I am in the industry so I know how it can be. We were the only table in there besides one more family. My boyfriend and my three kids came in for hibachi but didn't know it wasn't available for lunch so we decided to dine in anyways. She was horrible from the second we sat down, she made us feel like we were an inconvenience for being there. I asked about a tuna roll and she ordered it for us, even though we didn't want it. I asked for soy sauce ramekins and she brought two over and was clearly irritated when I asked for three more. The list goes one with her irritation with serving us. Food was great like always. As I mentioned, I'm in the service industry so when I go out, I start with a 40% grat and work my way down if that's the case. Alexa received 0%. I tried to let a lot go but just couldn't. Last but not least we ordered dessert at the end and she was rudely talking to another table while attempting to write down our order, I asked her if she was ready to listen to our order and she was very rude. I asked to speak to a manager and was told there wasn't one there and wouldn't be till the evening. I've been coming to Sushi Ko for many years but if this is the type of service they give now a days, I will not be returning.",

They greeted us with a Japanese phrase when we walked in. I really dig the red and white color scheme of the place. We sat at corner. Seems like the servers don't have assigned tables. We had different servers with us throughout the night. There were three or four of them. The service was fast. The sushi was great. The rice-to-fish ratio on the nigiri was good. The taste was fresh. Really enjoyed the food here. The prices are reasonable considering the type of food. Will probably order take-out soon. Good new sushi spot.",

The waitress conferred with Simon and then came back to the table and asked my likes and dislikes.  She brought me a Hot and Sexy Roll and a Crispy Rice roll.  The guests at the Teppan table were all raving about their food and I was raving about my sushi!  Harold's Samurai combo was tender and delicious and my sushi was flavorful and like a food rainbow with each bite:  textures, flavors and colors.  Our bill was very reasonable for dinner for two.

    "text": "This place sucks.  I came here because of the good yelp reviews. Came at lunch and gotten two of the lunch special and a sushi special. It took an hour and a half just for everything to come. They said that they only have one chef cooking in the kitchen because the other chef called out. So it took literally an hour just for the hot food to come. Then come the sushi, an hour later still no sushi so supposedly they forgot the order and will make it ASAP. The sushi lunch special came out and there was a sushi that just got an imitation crab on top, seriously, I could have done that myself at home, that's not considered sushi. They said the sushi would be on the house and it actually wasn't, I guess they forgot about that too. It also took them forever to get the bill that we just left cash instead of paying with card because we were just sitting there for another 15 mins.  Never again.",

We ordered chicken for two and New York steak for two and both were well cooked and delicious. Our chef was personable and entertaining and overall it was a great experience! The only drawbacks for me for environmental, it was really cold and the restroom needed cleaning and the lights were burned out. Solid service from pleasant staff and good food.",

While the previous owner stuck around for the transition to the new ownership, I thought things were promising. The same wait staff, a few new sushi chefs, but mostly the same menu with a few tweaks. Last night was a completely new wait staff and they were not very friendly, seemed put off when asked for more water, and it took us five minutes to get a menu once we sat down.   More importantly the place was filthy! Dirty tables, dishes piling up in front of us and no one making an attempt to clean anything. Bathrooms were disgusting too. While Fred was always a presence, I did not see management once.  As for the food... Mediocre at best! We ordered Jalapeno Yellowtail sashimi and it came in huge, thick pieces. Also ordered the Rock and Roll 1 wrapped in cucumber but it was so poorly executed the cucumber fell apart and everything came out of the roll. And that one tasted too fishy.   Overall, I was super disappointed. Maybe it was a bad night but my sense was this is how it's going to be.",

    "text": "Unfortunately, this place needs to close for a while and get the kinks out before they restart and try running a restaurant. One of the worst dining experiences I've ever had. They tried to redeem themselves in the end, but it ruined a birthday dinner... I was still out of pocket $100... And most of my party stopped for fast food after because their food never came, they never had the opportunity to finish ordering... They were still hungry. The irony... We were basically the only people in the restaurant, and based the the good yelp ratings, I actually made a reservation for this place.   Let's start at the beginning. I walk in... They ask how many... I say I have a reservation. They ask for how many... Not my name... So clearly a reservation wasn't necessary. The place looks nothing like the photos. I thought it was going to be a chic dining establishment nice enough for a bday party. Not.. Hole in the wall sushi joint with two teppanyaki table options.   Next, we are seated. They take are drink orders. All is fine. They come back mere moments later for our food orders, part of our part had just sat down. My sis in law says she's not ready, so the waitress, with a huge attitude says, \"Well, we'll go to you last then.\" That was the beginning of WWIII. It wasn't what she said, it was how she said it. As a waitress, you should always treat your customers with respect, but especially my sister in law, or the claws will come out. She does not get talked down to. I was ready to walk out, but they sent another waitress, the owner apologized, and everything seemed okay... 20 min... 40 min... 60 min... No sushi. A salad and edamame came out... No other food. We were one of three other people dining in the whole restaurant... What had happened?   At 75 min, I said something... The owner/manager came back out to apologize. Assured us of a discount... Said certain rolls would be removed from our bill. Swore the food was coming... Said the snotty waitress got into a fight with his sushi chef before the fight with our table and things were not going well. I can appreciate that. You're having a rough night. But you see... Everyone around us was getting their food (yes, the three other tables).. And unfortunately... Your bad night has now made our celebration a bad dining experience. That's not cool. Figure out your situation behind he scenes. Don't let it rub off on the dining room. It's too bad because most of what ended up coming out finally was decent sushi. If ambience was nicer, the service better, I may come back if in the area. But no way... Not after that catastrophe of a meal.   I do thank them for trying to make up for it in the end, but as I said... Damage was done. The waitress we ended up getting after our crazy one lost it and bailed, she was very kind and confused as to where her order had gone and where our food was. But, if it's not working like a team... It isn't working... And you're not giving me anything to come back to. Sorry. :(",

For that money i would expect some speed and quality!!!!!  So here I am in the need for something fast so out of desperation I go back in 2018.....  Should I be surprised.... the fried rice smelled like fish and I kept asking the guy and he sweared up and down that there was no fish in it. Once again got Sushi and I ordered the vegetable and avocado. I have never never ever seen vegetable sushi with lettuce in it???? Who does that..... it tasted so strange with lettuce in it.    Ok so for sure I am never going back even in desperation! The food is so expensive and not worth a cent...  Listen up peeps there are quality Japanese restaurants around town and this is NOT one of them, I repeat RUN!!!!!!  MICHAEL those were 2 separate visits to the restaurant. 3/14/17 and this one which I posted photos in 2018 like a month ago. The other review in 2017 had brown avocado but doesn't matter either way at this point!",

The cook  was great,  great personality and really explained what he was doing as he cooked , but we would never eat here ever again! The rice was not good tasted like rice or Roni, The quality of the ingredients we're just very crappy the steak was so chewy and hard and He cooked it  medium, so it was not the cook! I also must add that the chicken was dark meat, and very thin! Ughhh... just not good, We prefer white meat, also the salad was nothing but green leaves not even iceberg with veggies, which we prefer with nothing but dressing they definitely are very cheap when it comes to quality that is why we would  never ever eat here again.  Thanks for your reply.  As far as the salad goes, there  was nothing in it but wilted spring leaves, as you said u added other stuff we had none of that. The meat I'm sure was a crappy cut like you said but your workers should know better especially if as the owner you do, same for the salad. As far as your long reply offering, as an business owner myself offering an incentive next time, due to the poor quality of food would of been nice, I've g.",

They just do it a lil diff but they have garlicky butter & their version of \"yum yum\" (previously diablo sauce @Benihana) that does the trick! Esp for seafood! Yum! The staff is all helpful & very friendly & check out their happy hour everyday 5-7pm, i usually go in for HH rolls & sake before reso at teppan table. Just sit back & enjoy the show!",

    "text": "We have been searching for a good local Tappan Yaki place to enjoy and I saw Sushi Ko on Groupon and thought...what the heck...let's give it a try. We have been so disappointed by other places we have gone but for the special offer on Groupon I thought it was worth a shot. Thank god I did. We have finally found a local restaurant that we will support!! It was so good. They have a special Groupon menu so deciding what to have was extremely easy. I had the shrimp lovers with fried rice and my man had the NY steak and shrimp combo.  It came with the traditional soup and salad. However...this soup was so tasty...unlike most places they had a lot of seaweed in it which adds so much flavor. We were lucky enough that the party that was supposed to sit with us decided to have sushi instead so they sat in the normal table side. So we got the show all to ourselves!! We felt so special. The staff was great. Very attentive and always made sure our glasses were full. We added a 3 skewer plate for an appetizer, shrimp, chicken and steak, and we also ordered the deep fried lobster skewers. Linnen was our Chef! He was amazing...you could tell he has been doing this for a VERY long time. Everything was cooked to perfection...but I have to say...my favorite part was the rice, he made it just a tad spicy and put another aioli sauce on it and it was so packed full of flavor that we didn't even use the sauces he gave to us. The shrimp was perfectly buttered and garlicy!!! We are so glad that we came and will definitely be back!!! A must do...support the local business owners!!!",

I just thought others who attend this restaurant should know about what happened when I went here about a month or so ago.   I was at the sushi bar and a cockroach crawled out of the sushi area where they make their food/sushi .... and the server crushed it right in front of me on the bar with a napkin. I ended up moving, had a miso soup and left.  I was disgusted and I personally have never seen that before. I even have a groupon that I bought months ago and never ended up using due to this experience.   If the business owner of the establishment ends up reading this, I really hope you ended up cleaning your restaurant because your servers and cooks acted like it was normal incident to see a cockroach crawling on your sushi bar... I was so upset, I just wanted to try out a new sushi restaurant but what an upsetting experience.",

Their sushi is decent I'm not much of a roll person but my favorite roll is at this location out of all the sushi places I've been. The Bonzai roll which is a salmon, crab meat, avocado, deep fried and and served with creamy tangy sauce.   Teppan: This is the only sushi restaurant I've seen with Teppan which is a style of Japanese cooking where the chef cooks in front of you. Which is a pretty neat experience, most of the time these chefs are super social so they're not just chefs but also cooking entertainers.  Customer Service: The customer service here is pretty decent, expect one time I had a hard time flagging a girl down to refill my hot green tea and also had a hard time trying to get my check.   Location: This place is right off the free way of 95 & Craig which makes it a prime location also its in a busy shopping center and on the far side of the shopping center so people passing by can see their sign on the side of their building.",

Finally our food was served and no one ever came back to refill our waters or ask if we needed anything else. We asked for our check and the waitress apologized and said sorry we are going through shift change, and I needed to get my paper work completed from yesterday. Seriously? Horrible service, will never refer anyone to this place.",

Apparently Sushi Ko is under new management and their lunch menu has changed. Well that's not entirely True, on-line the lunch special is as it always has been \"Awesome,\" but when you get to the restaurant the menu is not the same, \"Bait and Switch.\" They are not willing to honor their on-line menu. As for the sushi I can't comment because I walked out, I've always been a fan and I have have spent a few thousand dollars at Sushi Ko over the years, I am saddened that it is under new ownership another gem down the drain. Shame on the staff for not honoring the menu, I will no longer be a mobile advertisement for Sushi Ko and I will no longer recommend to friends and family.",

The waitress we had was awesome and used our typical sushi roll preferences to help us choose some rolls that we'd enjoy. We ordered the 'Lemon Roll', 'Hot & Sexy', 'Baked Salmon' and 'Marilyn Monroe'. They all complimented each other nicely and overall I'd highly recommend a visit to this place if you're in Vegas.",

    "text": "I went here on a Wednesday night, on a whim, after finding a discount coupon for $12 for $21 worth of sushi. The Sushi chef, Michael I believe, was very polite. There was an obnoxious couple on the other side of the sushi counter, being loud, but Michael kept his composure.   The sushi was fantastic. This was my first time to eat sushi up at the counter, and obviously my first experience with quality fish, because it had much better flavor, color and texture than I have ever seen before. The nigiri cuts were very generous, and the rolls were a good size as well. You definitely get what you pay for. Food service was very prompt, but the beverage service left a lot to be desired. I was never offered soy sauce, and there was not a single bottle on the counter. Thankfully, the sushi was so delicious I did not need the soy sauce. It also took a long time to get a drink, and I was never offered a refill until I was basically done, and then they brought me water instead of the soda I was drinking. I observed the couple across the counter get several refills before I was even offered one. The waitresses were hiding somewhere because one never even walked by for me to ask for a refill.   I am hoping that the poor beverage service is because I went an hour and a half before closing, and they were obviously starting to clean up, and not the norm. Thankfully the sushi more than made up for the beverage service. I will definitely return!",

We were seated immediately.  The waiter was very friendly and helpful. It took us a while to decide what we wanted to eat.  They handed us 3 menus!  The sushi selection is huge! I did love that everything was pictured so you could see what you were ordering.  The calamari tempura was delicious.  They also gave up some soup.  We aren't sure what kind it was, but it was pretty tasty, too.  We ordered combos B and D so we could sample several different flavors.  It had various sushi and nigiri sushi.  We were a bit disappointed.  The nigiri sushi didn't seem very fresh.  And the flavors were what you would expect from a buffet, not a sit down restaurant.  Overall, I think we will keep looking for a sushi place.  Just wanted to add on that the next day, my husband and I were both very sick.  Should have known better than to eat sushi that doesn't look fresh.  Ugh.",

The sauce on the roll was sooooo good.  I was surprised because this is at my local NW Vons center! I wasn't sure what to expect but that roll was so yummmy (3m's)!  We also ordered the fried rice combo which my husband thought was so good he ate 3 bowls of it.   Service was excellent. Sam was super attentive and I told him people wrote good stuff about him on Yelp which is awesome.   Had dessert fried banana and ice cream and my husband loves fried dessert so he ate almost all of it. Portion was quite big. The ice cream flavor is pistachio and it was delicious.   For the solid pricing, I'd say this place is a five.",

The rice in the lemon roll was soggy and fell apart and again the fish was cut way too thick and lacked flavor. And the lobster roll was topped with soooo much sweet & sour sauce it completely over powered the $16 lobster. (Btw it tasted just like store bought kikomon sweet & sour). At that point we were still hungry but totally done ordering because the sushi was so bad. What a disappointment. There is better places in town to choose from that are better and less expensive.

I told her we were ready to order. I ordered the Salmon plate and asked for the salmon to be cooked medium rare..my companion order a bento box with calamari and teriyaki salmon and also asked for his salmon to be medium rare and eel roll. She left to put in the order as she was passing the table I asked if I could put in another order was told yes..ordered the grilled calamari. Smallest roll ever comes out (we laugh thinking that's how they do the $5 Monday roll specials). 15 minutes passed Eva brings out 2 miso soups and my salad and tells the person I'm with that theirs would be in the bento. 20 minutes pass and the cook with pony tail who we just saw doing the habachi brings a plate of rice with carrots on top and salmon with teriyaki sauce on it and gives it me and leaves. I flagged down the young asian man with blonde hair and asks him..is this garnish or vegetables and why does the salmon have brown sauce on it?..I told him I ordered the salmon plate and then tells me \"you sure you don't want it? (that's not what I ordered). 10 minutes after that my companion food comes out and he says the salmon is perfect. I'm still waiting for my food...20 minutes later my food comes out piping hot and dug my fork into the fish,tough.Overcooked not medium rare.  I flagged down the blonde asian man and told him its overcooked and can they refire it,he takes it behind me where the other register is and another cook and hisself inspects the food talk another language ..eva puts the calamari down now..COLD AS ICE..I send it back and ask to speak to someone. The Hispanic looking guy comes to the table he apologizes for the mishap then tells us to order something for our inconvenience and all the food would be comped..I told him,i was there with a groupon and was trying to check out the place and was disappointed yet since he was trying to produce a better customer service experience,i agreed to 2 rolls, a tuna and salmon. Tiny rolls,still hungry. Ask for the check..the asian blonde comes to the table and asks for the Groupon ..WTH! They CHARGED us for everything! Even the food that was sent back. Horrible...it made me more upset because I've recommended this place to ppl and to get treated like this. I should've known better to stay because the soap dispenser didn't work in the bathroom,so how are they cleaning their hands. I've been a chef/cook for years and I've never experienced this kind of Customer service EVER.  How can you cook 1 salmon right and not the other? It's HIGHLY INSULTING!! HIGHLY INSULTING...and the trick that was played saying it would be comped,WOW. 2 hours of my life wasted here.",

One of the sushi chefs, I guess that's what you would call him, with the long hair, made a very rude and impatient noise when we were gathering our belongings to head out. I have never been treated like that at a restaurant before. I will also be calling the manager on said sushi chef because he should not be allowed to treat his customers that way.

    "text": "If I had previewed Yelp details and reviews, I would have known that Happy Hour was not held on Fridays. But, since we were already here, we decided to stay and so glad we did!  We stopped in six weeks prior and were happy with the service and food, so much so that I wanted to try it again before reviewing since there are conflicting ratings.  Well, I now feel ready to write a straight-up review based on tonight and last month's visit.  The servers, on both our visits, were attentive and prompt.  We over ate and overspent both times because they were on the ball and ready with the drinks, refills, and genuinely wanted to know if things were to our liking and if we wanted anything else. Of course we are easily swayed when our sushi, sashimi and grilled items are delicious! At last month's visit, we ordered a variety of sushi (ngiri, classic and creative rolls) and grilled items. The grilled calamari wasn't just a jumble of rings and tentacles--it was a nice presentation of the entire squid! We also recalled that the yakitori and pork belly sliders were tender and flavorful. Also at last month's visit, we were entertained by watching the teppanyaki chef, Don, conducting his fiery food techniques in such a fun way. Like dinner and a free show.  Tonight, hubby and I ordered enough to feed a small army. Starting with both salmon and maguro (tuna) sashimi, the no-rice rock-n-roll #3 with crab mix/shrimp tempura/wrapped in cucumber, green mussels, and rattlesnack (tortilla wrapped tuna with jalapeno and other spicy ingredients)--we proceeded to devour every morsel, washing it down with hot sake and chilled beer. Because the Scottish salmon was buttery good and the tuna so fresh, we placed another order. The second order was a work of art--I posted pictures because my description can't do it justice--it was a large shallow bowl filled with decorations, greenery and flowers worthy of the Bellagio Conservatory! I had to thank the cute sushi chef for his pretty art.  It was so gorgeous I didn't want to dig into it, but we couldn't resist. The tuna was again slices of deep red ocean goodness and the large pieces of Scottish salmon--oh my, we are now devotees of that buttery, delicious salmon. And since we didn't celebrate Fat Tuesday this week, we designated tonight as our Fat Friday, then ordered the Alaskan roll as our dessert.  More than two hours and over $100 later, we waddled out happy, even though we missed Happy Hour by a day. I'm glad to give 5 stars because both our recent visits were enjoyable, with prompt and courteous service, delicious sushi, fresh sashimi, and great grilled dishes.",

Seafood is always fresh and rolls, although not extraordinary, are very well done.  Service is good and prices are fair.  Sushi bar is lively and nice selection of beverages.

The service was okay, but seemed like they were very short tempered and unhappy. The food was decent, ordered their El Diablo roll... wasn't as spicy as I thought it would be. Saw dead roaches by the tables. DISGUSTING. The staff turn over is ridiculous, completely different from the first time I went in.",

We got there around 5 pm. Not many people were in the restaurant nor was there anyone at the teppanyaki tables. We sat and waited for the entire party to arrive. It took a really really long time to get drinks served...sign #1 we should have gotten out of there. Sign#2 the waitress could not get any drink order right. As new people would show up they also sat there forever waiting to get drinks. Finally as everyone arrived and everyone finally had drinks we ordered. Remember we were basically the only ones in the restaurant. 1st ones at the teppanyaki table with a group of about 8. BIG SIGN #3...The waitress fired up the tables to get them warm for our dinner. As soon as she did......OMG.....roaches started scrambling.  I guess the heat from the table woke them up.  We saw two running for cover and one ran directly across the cooking surface. We notified the waitress and she blew us off and said dont worry, we will just cook on the other one!  I was mortified. Meanwhile, another roach had made its way onto the table. We told the waitress again and she covered it up with a plate and cotinued to ask us what we wanted for dinner. They brought salads, and I was like...are you kidding.? We are leaving this place faster than you can say teppanyaki. The whole party of 8 left shortly there after and went to OhJah Sushi for a spectacular meal and service and no roaches!! Please use caution eating here. We notified the health dept as well. It is a major concern!!",

The happy hour is cool, $5 for items on a limited menu. I doubt we'd be returning.",

I liked it so much I decided to go on Groupon and rebuy the same deal. The man who took our reservation and sat us was great.  The ladies refilling drinks were awesome. Sushi before dinner was great. Then the chef comes First thing out of his mouth \"why did you guys come here so late?\" We both thought it was a joke.... nope. \"Today is my brothers memorial and now I have to stay here for you two. I dont even really work here I just agreed to help them out. I shouldn't even have shown up.\" My wife looked at me and said \"should we let him leave?\" We both thought how horrible his brother just died. Nope. His next comment was \"It will probably be over when I get there. We have a little party for him every year and now im stuck here with you guys\" Normally I'm not a passive person. However I havent had much experience telling someone to stop being rude when it involves a dead family member. So we just remained quiet. He turned what was on June 3rd a 15 min cooking show into a 3 to 5 min speed cooking session. My rice is almost raw. My veggies are hard in the center. The rest is decent but not a flavorful as they were cooked for 1 to 2 mins tops.  Our reservation was at 9. We got there 20 till and had drinks and some sushi before. He began cooking at 9pm by 920 we were asking for boxes to get away from him.  I told the main waiter I feel bad because if they are splitting tips I'm not giving them anything. That guy is a complete asshole and ruined our night. He said if I used cash he could make sure. So I did. I gave the staff $32 and we left. I did tell the waiter why. The people who were leaving that are before us were also talking to eachother about stuff he had said to them and how they couldnt believe it   It sucks because I liked the place. However they messed up. I'm never eating there again. I eat at Kaizen 3 times a week minimum.  I thought I had found my new spot. Now I will never spend another dime there. More over I plan to let me friends who told me about the place on my BDay know as well.  So there food is great. The hibachi chef who is skinny and sounds like some street thug sucks. If you decide to go there there is a younger bald kid. He was awesome on my  birthday. If you get the 30ish longer hairs skinny asain guy... you're screwed. I'd just leave. Seriously",

    "text": "We went here Friday night, first time back in years... total mistake. Waitress earned the single star, she was good. In fact, she was so enthusiastic about their food that she could probably talk a vegan into trying stuff. Word of warning, though, don't.  First, the interior. Dirty, dated, scuffed. Did I mention dirty?  Ordered a variety of foods:  Pink Taco - lettuce wrapped around fried fish with a flavorful, spicy sauce. Be careful, though, it's main purpose is to pull you into thinking you're going to have a great dinner.  Foie Gras - while wrapping sashimi around tiny dabs of foie gras might be innovative, each would have been better without the other. You get two very tiny pieces for $5.  Sonomono Salad - Hubby loved, but I would give it an \"okay\". Both of us agree, though, that it was the best part of the meal.  Short Ribs - Hubby ordered, then the waitress returned and let him know they were out of them. At 7pm on a Friday.  Chicken Wings - There's 5 in an order (despite what the waitress had said) and they were properly cooked. The Korean chili sauce was good but the after-taste wasn't.  Various nigiri - none of it was fresh. It was either not sushi-grade or badly cut, not sure which, but it is the only time I have spit sushi out of my mouth. We didn't get ill, but we did get repulsed.  Lemon Roll - was actually good, initially, but then I bit into something that crunched and there was nothing in the ingredients that would crunch. Didn't eat further and tried not to think too much about that crunch.  When we complained, our waitress disappeared for a while then returned with an offer of $20 off our next visit, which we laughingly refused. We asked to pay so we could leave, but she disappeared again. This time, she returned with a comped meal where we only paid for the parts we liked. She handled that part well, but it doesn't change the fact that the meal was disgusting and we will never return.",

I personally don't eat seafood but my husband and kids got the Lisa Lisa (I think) and enjoyed.  Chef Don cooked our food and gave us a show. I have to admit I was impressed with his lemon trick. The food was awesome. I got the ribeye and YUM! The only downside was the other people at the table.  They totally ignored the chef and one man even said the rice is better somewhere else.  Rude! That's not the restaurants fault and next time I'll fill up the whioe hibachi table with my friends and not have to worry about other people.",

    "text": "Came here for dinner with my husband on Sunday, July 10th.  Walked in and the place wasn't crowded at all.  There was alot of empty dirty tables.  Nobody was at the podium so we walked over to the sushi bar to say hello to the chef that we knew from another establishment.  The floor was very sticky in front of the sushi bar. An employee walked over to us and we told him we had reservations at 7 p.m.  Shortly after that a lady came over to us and told us our table was ready for us.  She was going to seat us at a sport where there was fried rice all over the table from the previous guests.  She quickly took her hand and fanned it off the table with her hand.  We sat down.  We placed our orders and a short time our hibachi chef came out.  Things were going ok until he lost grip of the grill fork and it came flying my way and lodged into the right side of my dress!  I was in complete shock not knowing if I was just penetrated by the grill fork or not.  I pulled the grill fork out of the side of my dress.  Luckily I just got a scratch from the fork on my side but it could have been alot worse!  The chef quickly left the table in a panic and was gone for a few minutes and came back asking if I was ok asking if we wanted an upgrade in meat or possibly a cocktail.  Never did the manager or owner come to the table and ask if I was ok.  I think that is what upset me the most after all this.  I understand that accidents happen.  I know that the chef probably feels really bad for what happened.  But for the business owner to not come over to see if I was ok??????  I pulled that grill fork out of the side of my dress!!!!  There were 3 other people that we didn't know at our table that saw this happen.   Needless to say our experience at Sushi Ko was not a good experience.  Management/owner did not express any concern that this incident occurred.  I went to the restroom and the light was so dimmed that I had to tell an employee that the lighting was so horrible I couldn't even see the extent of my injury.  She went into the restroom and did something with the light switch that made the light much brighter.  Went back in and was able to see the extent of the scratch from the grill fork that penetrated my dress.  Not a good experience at all.",

I always ordered the spicy chicken/teri beef combo.  The spice may be too powerful for some so if you're not a big fan of spicy, make sure to steer clear.  The teri beef was a bit on the sweet side, but nothing that was terrible.  My wife usually ordered the shrimp udon bowl which was also pretty good.  My kids enjoyed the Hawaiian Sushi, which is basically your typical ahi sushi roll topped with spicy tuna.  It was their taste of home away from home.  I haven't been back since I moved back to Hawaii two years ago but a good friend of mine called me a few weeks ago asking about the \"sushi place on Craig\" that I always raved about.  I got the report back from him and he gave it two thumbs up as well.",

    "text": "I hope this review makes sense. Sushi-Ko was good by American standards. It is the best Japanese food we've come across in the states. But if the place was actually in Japan it would be the worst Japanese food we've tried. Does that make any sense at all?  We moved to Vegas last year after nine incredible years in Japan. We've had a heck of a time finding good, authentic Japanese food. We really want some good yakisoba. I was sure this was going to be the place because, as I understand it, it is owned by a Japanese man. I was wrong--this was not the place for good yakisoba. The yakisoba was not good. The noodles were wrong. The dish was FULL of vegetables. In Japan they use mostly noodes, then some meat and then a bit of veggies. This dish from Sushi-Ko was more veggies than anything else. And the flavor was not there at all. Street vendors in Japan sell better yakisoba. Sadly, this was actually the best attempt we've seen in the states. We also orderd the beef dunburi. The beef was actually very good. The terkiyaki was just right and the meat was tender. However, it was served on FLUFFY rice!! I was very disappointed in the rice and it ruined the entire dish for me. For some reason Americans like fluffly rice. I don't get it and I don't get what fluffly rice was doing in a place that supposedly serves Japanese cuisine.  The gyoza were good but not at all like what you'd get in Japan. Sushi-Ko's gyoza was made in a like a crispy fried shell. In Japan they are served in what is more like a noodle. Think of it kind of like a ravioli. It wasn't what we were used to. I prefer the noodle version but the gyoza was still good.  I ordered the smoked salmon sushi and was very disappointed. It was not like any smoked salmon I ever got in Japan. Not even close. Plus, it had a funny chemical taste to it. It did not taste fresh at all. The California rolls with  crab were actually very good and worth the extra money for the real crab rather than immitation. But finding good California rolls in the states is not an oddity.  Overall I was very disappointd with the place. If you've never tried authentic Japanese food then this place will probably be a treat.  However, if you've been exisiting on authentic Japanese food for the past nine years then you'll notice that this place is like all the Chinese places in the states--totally Americanized.",

Well, we got this flyer in the mail advertising \"2 for 1 tepanyak\". So my wife and I area like, yah, let's sit at the live cooking station and have a blast! Well, when I asked the server about the 2 for 1 she showed me the menu where basically what they have done is create a whole new \"2 for 1 menu\" but instead of like $20 per person for a dish, it's like $35 for 2 to eat, you see the BS here or is it just me? I am instantly turned off by bait and switch nonsense so I opted out of the table cooking. My wife had her heart set on it so she ordered for herself and I just ordered a couple of sushi rolls. The food was good and the chef was entertaining. The server (a lady) got the notion that I was turned off by the 2 for 1 baloney and she went sour on us at that point. We won't be back, the only thing getting it the 2 stars instead of 1 was the food which like I said was good.",

He said that they are going to provide us with the out of the world feel with their taste. Now I was really crazy as I know my cousin he does not just say anything without reason.To start, the place was really crowed, but was superbly handled by the serving staff and everybody was looking quite relaxed and satisfied. The waiters and servers were quick and have good skills to manage.Going through the menu it was just full of variety of stuff but was beautifully presented and the prices were reasonable as well. Firstly, we decide to have some starter and ordered  Mussels and Miso soup! It was smoking... Good taste to start off with. We ordered for dinner and in no time it was there. My cousin and I were sitting at the Sushi bar and Wilson served us the dinner, with whom, we were quite impressed. Sushi rolls....... rocks! We got our money's worth. I had this rolls before as well but the ingredients put in this was just making your tongue know what the actual taste is. Adding up to the taste were the sauces provided with it. Nice work Wilson and the team. I am definitely going to recommend this 5 star place if you want to know what the taste is that too in reasonable rates.",

    "text": "We decided to eat here after purchasing a Groupon deal, and after looking at the 4-5 star reviews on here. Let's just say... we will never be making that mistake again. The food was horrid- the fish was far from fresh and the service was a disaster. We were one of two groups in the whole place, and it took an hour to get our food. Also, our waiter visited out tables twice in that entire span of time... and yet he was only a few feet away going through receipts at the cash register. First off- I really don't think you should be doing that in sight of the customers. Second off- pay attention to the people that are currently IN your restaurant! We asked for our check after taking only a few bits of a few rolls, and even cancelled the ones that hadn't come yet. The food was honestly just horrid. The manager came by to see if everything was okay, and didn't seem to like that fact that we weren't overly impressed with the food. She was kind enough to not charge us for three of the rolls, but argued with us on the \"freshness of the fish\". Seriously- my husband is a sushi-addict and we were with our Hawaiian friend- we KNOW what fresh fish tastes like. They both said that the Unagi tasted like it was going bad. Also- just FYI- they don't use real crab- instead they use a weird mayonnaise concoction with imitation crab that tastes as bad as it sounds. The manager also argued with us that all sushi places use imitation crab, which was entirely unTrue. Overall, it was a very unpleasant dining experience and we were very anxious to get out... but naturally, getting our check and paying took a while as well.  Also, I'd like to add, my husband and I were scratching our heads as to why this place had a 4-5 star rating on here. Well, turns out, in the restaurant they have a sign stating any Yelp review given while eating will get a free dessert. So, there you go, all of the high ratings on here are just due to some free sugar. Avoid this place!",

However, if your a fan of fresh sushi that boast quality nothing short of impecable swiming in delicious creative sauces on a bed of thinly sliced diagon radishes this is the place for you.  As simple of a combination you can get. Top quality ingrediants, friendly service at a great price.  What else could you ask for?  I owe that fat mexican Jason R 2 spots below me for taking me to this great vegas establishment.  Krazy sushi is my favorite place but sushi ko does provide a very close 2nd. If you disagree I'm sorry, but you just don't know jack shit about raw fish.",

    "text": "I have lived in Vegas since 91. To find decent service and quality in Vegas is near impossible. I am the type of person that believes in doing my part, helping the economy recover by going to local establishments. I try to stay away from the franchises big properties. I have a rotation of about 3-4 sushi places that I frequent with the goal of helping these establishments, building up a rapport as well as enjoying some good sushi. I had been going to Sushi Ko for many years and probably have eaten there 20-25 times going back 2001.  My most recent visit will be my last, which I am sad to report since finding decent sushi that includes friendly service is getting harder to find in Las Vegas. I guess I do not understand the rules of eating at an establishment. If an establishment posted opened until 10:00 PM, does it not mean if you walk in at 9:45 that you should be able to receive service? Courteous service?    When we walk in to the establishment at 9:45 we was unaware that it was SO LATE!   We were quickly informed by the host that it was soon to closing time and that we needed to order quickly.  I assured the host that we knew what we wanted and we would order quickly. During this time I was watching the Sushi Chef to gauge his demeanor. The last thing you wanted is a pissed off Sushi Chef, preparing your RAW fish.  As soon as we started walking toward his serving area, I could read his body language. He was clearly upset that he was going to have to serve us. I was already deciding this was not going to go well. He immediately raised a finger to us and stated, \"YOU ONLY GET ONE, YOU ONLY GET ONE TIME!\" I think what he was trying to tell us that, we could only order once, that we could not linger or spend any amount of time, order, eating or sitting.  That was it, with the last amount of dignity I had left told the chef it was ok, we would leave and go somewhere else,  sorry to inconvenience you. Please forgive us.  In Las Vegas there are a 100 establishments opening in Vegas every month. 100 more closing every month. I try to stay away from the Big Casino properties; they get enough traffic as it is. I try to help the little guy. On this occasion the little guy didn't need my business. So be it, I do not have to go to Sushi KO anymore, which is sad because they have a decent product that I had enjoyed in the past. Like most everything else in Vegas, nothing last forever.",

I would absolutely recommend this place!!",

I ordered chicken fried rice for $8.50 and I was fairly satisfied with the meal. It was a lot and I do believe it was worth the price paying for.  At the end of the entire meal, we payed separately. It took longer than it should have to get our card / cash back. Overall the experience and service was alright. The price for my meal came out with $10.57 including gratuity. Although I didn't get sushi I do believe that some of the selections were overpriced.",

    "text": "Came here for dinner with the fam. The place was decent, casual dining. The set up was hibachi on the left side of the room and booths on the right with tables in the middle. I purchased a Groupon deal; $70 value for $43! We ordered 3 sushi rolls, baked muscles, seaweed salad, and a bento box. The food was good;restroom on the other hand sucked! You walk into a dark room, flip the light switch and boom! Let there be light you say? Did I not flip the switch? Is it broken? Repeat the process and you get a VERY DIM light. You're better off turning on your cellphone! The toilet paper sits on the silver hand rail and not on the roller dispenser, it's close to done with no extra roll, feel bad for the next person. Also, how would you know if the roll you used didn't fall on the floor? They do have seat liners! Yay, good for them. You wash your hands and wave your hand by the sensor for paper towel, only to realize there isn't any, but how would you know until you squint your eyes cuz remember, the light is so bright in the room, and see that the dispenser is empty! I would have rated this place with more stars, but I believe that restrooms should be decent. Afterall, the employees are the ones handling your food so you tend to think about the sanitation. How do they dry their hands? On themselves?  Do they even wash their hands? Maybe it's just me. TIP:Bring your own hand sanitizer!Anyway, I would recommend purchasing a Groupon offer as it's also pretty pricey here so the Groupon deal is well worth it, but read the fine print as I believe it's good for dine in only. Customer service was average. Like I said earlier, the food was good and my rating is based on MY experience. So give this place a try for their food! I recommend take out! LOL One last thing, they do not offer AYCE sushi here.",

Upon asking for hibachi the host informed us that it would take at least 15-20 min for the chef to even start cooking because there was a party before us. They only had one hibachi chef that night, I am not sure if this is a regular thing because they have 4 cook tops.  Since there was a little wait expected we ordered some appetizers (seaweed salad, fried oyster, rock shrimp, and chicken wings) I would say all of it was ok, not something I would go back for though.  Once the chef came he was really friendly and talkative like all hibachi chefs are. Although two in our party ordered their steak medium rare and he was talking so much he over cooked it a little.  Overall it was okay but I would probably go to Geisha House next time.",

It's taken me 6 months to finally try this place because the fear that was put upon me by other yelp reviewers. Do not pay attention to those reviews, that was my first mistake. This place was solid good! That happy hour menu was delicious, & portions were not skimpy, (I'm sure everything off the happy hour menu is delicious too). A nice laid out, formatted menu with many options like Nigiri, Sushi Rolls, Appetizers, & even Sake & Beer. I ordered the Hot Night Roll, Albacore Nigiri, & another zesty Hamachi roll. Moment of truth, my sushi comes out, & as one previous yelp reviewer mentioned that the fish was bad..... it was not. The fish did not taste or look bad, & the taste did not disappoint. The rest that I ordered was the chicken & beef skewers, & gyoza, which you simply can't go wrong with. Sake cocktails were really good too! Super refreshing. All in all, Service was good too. Shoutout to the sushi chefs, they gave us these mini Salmon Tostadas with what seemed like a creamy mayo ponzu sauce.  I thought that was very nice of the chefs, & that was the moment I felt welcomed & their way of saying \"we admire your service\".   Listen this place has some people posting some negative reviews but pay no attention to those reviews. Whatever negative reviews they have gotten you can tell this place has taken that & is trying their best to change from those negative reviews, (I mean come on! They remodeled the place). That is a business that cares about their business & customers. Ending this long review, I can say that my partner & I went in after getting in an argument & once we ate & had a drink at Sushi Ko, all that changed & we were happily satisfied. Awesome place.",

    "text": "We used the Groupon for $40. If a bento box with three items is $19.50, I am not sure what the up charges were on the receipt. I hate to nickel and dime but it comes down to the fact that purchasing a Groupon allows people to try different restaurants and personally based on the first impression of a place decides whether the patron will go back. Nowhere on the menu does it state different prices based on the items you chose for the box. Super shady to charge extra for items that were not stated as extra in the menu and for this reason only I cannot patronize this place no matter how good the food or service was.   For all the other Groupon's purchased, the prices have been clearly stated and you end up paying for drinks and a tip. Not the case here.  Three stars for the flavor or the beef teriyaki and very polite service from the wait staff.",

Waiters were inattentive, food took over 30 minutes to come out, AND not all or our rolls came out. The fish does not seem fresh, the avocados were brown. Our plates were chipped and the plate we were given had an old rice grain on it. The place smelled like sewage and the tables felt sticky. I really wish this place got better since it's been about a year since we have visited before last night and things def did not get better. Not to mention once we had our food, our waiter would zip past our table so it became nearly impossible to ask for our check.",

The manager pretty much gave us a \"sucks to be you guys\" response and could care less about the representation of the restaurant he gave. He told us to call back in a few minutes and essentially hung up. Finally got our food two hours late and it actually was pretty good, OH minus the hair on the sushi.

    "text": "Located on Craig/Tenaya  Check Groupon for deals!   I met some friends here for dinner one Thursday night. We had to make reservation as my friend had bought a Groupon to use for the teppanyaki dinner. Teppenyaki is a style of Japanese cuisine that uses an iron griddle to cook food. Thanks Wikipedia. Basically, the chef cooks the meal in front of you on an open grill.  The Groupon deal (for 4) comes with soup, salad, fried rice, protein and veggies. You can choose between chicken, shrimp and steak, for proteins. I chose the steak and shrimp combo. It was also happy hour, which is daily from 5-7, so we chose a sushi roll to share for only $5.   The miso soup came out first and it was fine. If you've had one miso soup, you've had them all. A house salad with ginger dressing came next. None of us really cared for the dressing that came on it. After this we waited a short while until the chef showed up. There seemed to be only one chef for the whole dining room, but maybe there are more when it is busier. The chef did a few tricks while he cooked our food. Nothing too over the top, but it was cool to watch. Our food was prepared quickly and we were eating in no time. Everything was hot and tasty. I will say I didnt particularly care for the sushi roll, that was the only disappointing thing for me. But other than that, I would for sure come back here again for teppanyaki.",

When i paid for my bill, i purchased the exsct same groupon again. So i will b back with the next 120 days.",

Still $5-$9 for some basic rolls. The actually good rolls are $10 and over.   And honestly I have never in my life had worse sushi than this. Honest to god some pieces of rice were still hard and everything tasted very old and not so fresh.   I ordered extra eel sauce or umagi sauce as some of you may call it and extra spicy mayo. Dudes fucking charge $1.50 for sauce! They wanted to charge me $6 for some fucking extra sauce!   Which they didn't even fill me in that it was extra! I was furious at this point honestly because my check ended up being around $55 and I was so unhappy with the food quality and the sauce literally put me over the edge because 1. Most places don't even charge for extra spicy mayo or eel sauce. And 2. They didn't let me know it was extra.   Hate this place. Worst sushi place in Vegas. And I've been to a lot.   I highly recommend anything over this place. Even albertsons sushi is better.   If you want a real good sushi place go to Kobes on rainbow or Kabuki or Sushi loca.",

    "text": "We bought a GroupOn at $37 for $70 worth of food but I forgot about it and it expired in 2017!  I found it in My GroupOn and we decided to use it while I was out with my husband and step-daughter.  The GroupOn was for Sushi Ko and it was very hard to find in the Shopping Mall, so we called the number listed and found it was Sushi 88.  We had read all the reviews about a sticky floor, slow service, etc. Those people are crazy!  It was very pleasant! The food was deeelicious!  They have a special promo menu that had 2fers.. select 2 for $5, select 2 for $10, 2 for $12 and 2 for $15.  I believe we ended up spending about $50 plus, minus the $37 from GroupOn.    The reason I rated Sushi Ko a 4 is because of the Special Oyster dish. It cost $6 and advertised as a 3 piece dish, which we thought would be a reasonably sized dish. Our fault I guess, but we were so full that we asked for for the oysters to be to go. I went to get mine the next day and was totally surprised and disappointed. The oysters were the size of my thumb!  I tasted one and it was gross!  It tasted slimy and old! Nasty!   Otherwise, I must add that the service was pretty good. There were a few people at the Hibachi table and I think 2 tables of people besides us, plus 2 people at the sushi bar. We sat at our table for about 10 minutes with our menus and it was a slow start at first.  Ralph was our waiter and he kept checking on us, brought us whatever we needed.. except for Splenda for my iced tea. I was very surprised to know they don't used it.   My husband and I just bought another GroupOn for Sushi Ko!  I don't know why they don't change the name to Sushi 88, since that's the name on the door and the name here!  It's wierd because Sushi Ko isn't even listed on Yelp!!  But we love the food and prices, so we'll go again!",

We booked our reservation. We were seated on time but it did take awhile to get started.  We opted for no veggies and double rice instead, they said it wouldn't be an issue but not sure if there was a miscommunication or what but by the end of the meal the cook had to cook our extra rice order at the end of everything. However that was the only issue.  The food here has the best flavor!! And the portions are a great size!!! My absolute favorite thing was the fact that they didn't try to add a bunch of hidden fees or extra charges on after the Groupon! We will absolutely be returning to this place. The service is great, food is great and the staff is friendly and great to work with!!",

Taikan, the sushi chef custom made me a giant sashimi bowl. Super tasty, delightful and fresh sashimi bowl. I would recommend it to anyone that loves sashimi like me.   Also they have hibachi where you can enjoy the entertainment while dining. Reasonable price. Thumb up for this place.",

Ours was good for 2 meals & 2 soft drinks. $45. We also ordered off the happy hour menu separately $5 Gyoza w/a good dipping sauce. Came w/2 salads and tofu soup. I also added monster for extra $5. We both ordered steak & chicken combo. Comes w fried rice & veges(mushrooms,broccoli, zucchini & onions). They've got the happy hour but it's not included w Groupon but I can order side items. I'd go back even without Groupon it'd be @$25 each o believe. Two issues: the floor was so sticky my shoes kept getting stuck to the floor so that shud be cleaned before customers are sat & the guy next to me sucked a piece of glass into His straw from his drink-so we kept looking at ours making sure we didn't have the same issue-def scary. Otherwise we had a decent time.",

The restaurant is in the Tommy Burgers strip mall. I suggested we go eat at Tommy's but they wanted Japanese...go figure! lol   The restaurant is nice. There's a few teppan yaki tables, a few dining tables and the sushi bar. I liked how there's big screen TVs playing sports in the background. Everyone is nice and the sushi roll I got was really fresh and tasted good. I don't remember the name of it but the plate was nicely decorated with an orchid and some veggies.   I'm glad I got to experience this place. I'd come here again and check out their happy hour!",

Thru management changes, owner changes and them changing their food supplier.. we became turned off  A family friend said they had recently been back and had a good experience.. so we decided to give the place another shot  I'll say that the place could use some TLC.. a little dirty for my liking. The food was prompt and wasn't smothered in sauces either.. but it wasn't the best sushi, probably average.. considering it's not an \"all you can eat\" spot, it should have been better for al a Carte..  I will continue to go else where.. the place isn't bad but there is better available so we will take our family there.  Maybe in the future it will improve, but after a period of time it's gone down hill..",

I ordered a bento box with chicken katsu, California roll, and chicken teriyaki. I realize that I didnt actually order order that much sushi. The bento boxes also came with miso soup, rice, salad, broccoli and pot stickers, so you do get a lot of food. Oh, and I almost forgot the orange slice. It was very sweet actually. When I first ordered, i mistakenly ordered the wrong thing, but our waiter let me switch it out for the chicken teriyaki. I also ordered mango mochi which was refreshing and it was a nice portion size.  The service was great as well. Our waiter continuously checked in on us and was very accommodating. I will like to try more actually sushi the next time, but the chicken katsu was too good not to get again.",

I was disappointed that the hibachi was about an hour wait, as they have two tables front and back (four total), but only one chef.  Due to this, we chose to do a table rather than wait.  I ate vegetable tempura as an appetizer.  It was pretty good, not bad tempura mix (I hate thin tempura) but the sauce didn't have as much taste as I like.  For dinner I got the binto box with chicken teriyaki and chicken katsu.  The teriyaki wasn't bad, the katsu wasn't horrible but not great.  It didn't have enough meat inside the breading, which is a pet peeve of mine.  The rice wasn't very fresh but was edible.   Service wasn't horrible but you had to ask for things instead of them offering.  The food wasn't horrible, my table mates seemed to like the sushi.  The issue was that several of us got horribly upset stomaches after this meal.  Since they all ate fish items and I didn't, it wasn't just one bad item.  I will likely not go here again, as I don't know what made everyone sick.",

Food: Green tea was served at a lukewarm temperature, and needed to be sent back to be remade.  The sushi roll i ordered was clearly made by an amateur. The roll was cut into uneven pieces, and sauce on the plate seemed to be drying out before it got to my table.   I ordered the rock shrimp appetizer, and it unfortunately was underwhelming. All I could taste was the batter, which wasn't really impressive at all. Bland batter and low quality shrimp will never lead to a hot dish.  Service My dad likes grilled yellowtail collar. I understand its usually limited and often runs out at multiple restaurants, however the server was unaware of the status of availability.   The server was too soft spoken, so we could barely hear anything he was saying. When he brought over the food, he held the plates in a way so that his thumb was almost in the food (We are talking a couple of millimeters). Believe me, if his thumb was in my food, I would have sent it back and tell him to try again.  From observation, it looked like it was either the owner or manager sitting at the back of the sushi bar. All he was doing was going to the kitchen to get food out to his spot. There was no interaction between him and the guests. To me, that was one of the bigger fails of this establishment. I know that the prior owner would come around and greet all the guests in the restaurant. That is one of the things that used to keep us going back to this place.   I dont plan on coming back. You have lost a repeat customer, which is how restaurants stay afloat. Great job.",

    "text": "In the past year it's gone from decent to bad to worse. Hello and welcome to my first negative yelp review.  Sushi ko has changed management a time or two which I've hoped would set the ship back on course but today is my last time seeing if it'll get better.  The employees are not personable anymore and untrained. I used to go several times a week and now I just sat for 30 minutes with no one even confirming my order was in or talking to me. The new chefs look very tired and have no character. They looked sad and didn't talk to me even once. It wasn't very busy and I notice the new manager is replying to other Yelpers with a lot of excuses - won't work here.  The food has gotten worse. This place has the worst cucumber salad I've ever seen. The portion sizes of my salmon salmon roll has noticeably decreased over time and the prices have increased.  Do you want more business? Bad yelp reviews and poor product / customer service isn't the way to do it.  The cherry on top is I had to kindly ask someone for a check to pay and when I left the people that ignored me followed me to the door panicking to ask if I had paid. Now I'm stealing? Miss, I've been to your establishment 50+ times this year and have seen you on most of them.   Here attached is what I get for $30 here now... Notice the packaging is upside-down.  Edit: I calculated that I was a $1500 to $3000 a year customer.  Edit 2: They messed up my order. Wow.",

    "text": "Now any other time I would give this place 5 stars but as a \"regular customer\" I was very disappointed.  I visited Monday 1/28/2019 for hibachi style as normal.  I order the same thing every time and so does the rest of my family.  Groupon has a special for 2, 4, 6 people. I get the salmon with fried rice and vegetables.  My kids get the tiger shrimp/ steak and my husband gets the steak and chicken.  They have gotten real stingy with portions from the first time I walked through the doors 2 years ago. the chef was awesome but he gave my husband what was suppose to be a 6oz-8oz steak that really looked like a child size portion of steak.. cut it in thirds and cut it into tiny baby pieces to make it seem like it was a lot. Then the rice! Normally this is the best part of dinner.. I noticed from being there just last month they no longer put peas and carrots in the rice and no longer put carrots into the vegetable mix. When I asked the chef just laughed it off and told me they stopped using carrots. And that they never had peas and carrots in the fried rice.... fried rice always had peas and carrots. The food is however very good, but I feel like they are just like any other growing business now, once the dough starts pouring in they change up and give you less. I'm sad to say that after this last visit I'm not going  back. Now I have to find a new spot",

They had arguments about the table numbers/location and what dish goes where. At one point, the waitress just gave up and tossed the food back on the counter.   It seems like a trend in the reviews that there's long wait times... And that is absolutely the case. IF YOU GO, YOU WILL WAIT FOREVER. Clearly, it is not a priority to them to provide efficient service because they have yet to correct it.  The quality of the sushi is also not good. The rolls were messy, not consistent, and lacked flavor. I'm also concerned that the Unagi (and other fish) were not fresh. I would encourage the health department to check into this place.  To my surprise, the owner was present the entire time and did not have the courtesy to apologize to all of his guests for the less than desirable restaurant experience.",

I split an order of rib-eye and shrimp with my friend (we had a groupon deal). Both of the rib-eye and shrimp was on point. The rib-eye was cooked just right; the meat was tender and juicy. Their shrimp was probably one of the best I've had in Las Vegas. The amount of food was definitively worth the price. Of course, I paid even less with the groupon so it was really worth. If you're looking for good food, good Teppanyaki, this is definitively the place to go!",

Not dirty dishes, I am talking about chunks of food still stuck to the plates  You can imagine, finding something like this just before you were about to eat RAW FISH that depends on being clean and freshly prepared, I am surprised at myself I even ate here afterwards, but I had a few people with us.  The rolls had some really strange flavors I could not identify, the spicy tuna roll and scallop roll tasted funky and bitter right off the bat, no one wanted to finish them.  A few of the other cut rolls we ordered were just put together poorly, and fell apart as soon as they were touched.  I needed a spoon to eat them.  The spider roll was another strange bitter taste, not good.  Volcano was good for a finish, but by this time everyone was afraid of their rolls   I don't give a lot of bad reviews, but this place deserves it.",

The chef gave us a little extra salad (even though the waiter was adamant that he would not do a substitution (which was fine).  We were happy with the extra salad, however, that's where it ends. I clearly ordered a spicy salmon roll (repeated it twice). When the waiter brought me spicy crab, I asked why.  He said \"because that's what I wrote down.\"  He very begrudgingly offered to bring me spicy salmon. I was already tired of the crappy service and didn't want to make a scene or disturb the chef, so I just kept the crab. THEN as my boyfriend was eating his salad, he found a piece of plastic in it.  Disgusting! There are SO many better sushi restaurants in town, DO NOT EAT HERE!",

The shrimp tempura roll wasn't what I expected.  It had the sweet soy sauce on top of the roll and avocado and cucumber.  I'm used to yum yum (spicy mayo sauce) inside the roll instead of that soy sauce on top, so I wasn't happy with it at all.  Shrimp is sweet as it is, and that particular sauce was way too sweet for me.  Their tuna sushi is good, and their crab sushi was good, too.  I am picky when it comes to sushi, so I'll stay away from here if I am looking for just that.  They are good for teppan off the strip, for sure, so I'll keep this as my teppan stop near home instead of my sushi stop.  I know people will disagree because they are used to their personal types of rolls and sushi, but the way that they make theirs is not what I'm used to from home or eating in Japan.  Also, I hate avocado in sushi and rolls.  It's a no no for me.",

They recently went under new management, and had a few hiccups, but the quality of the food here is top notch. For a few months after new management the service was not up to par, but the quality of the sushi kept me coming back. I have spoken to a few employees about the issues I was having (wait times, wrong orders, etc) and they were extremely apologetic and helpful. I have not had any issues with wait times or wrong orders since... In fact it seems they go above and beyond to make sure everything is correct & prompt. Michelle is the best employee they have... She is the one I always make sure to deal with and she always goes out of her way to make sure everything is to my liking. People & businesses make mistakes, but once the kinks were worked out this place has not disappointed. I recommend it to everyone I know.",

    "text": "I haven't been to Sushi-Ko since the change in ownership.  But, you can tell the difference the minute you walk in. The atmosphere is completely different. When we arrived, there were one large group and a smaller group at the teppan grill. You would think that the service would be excellent considering the restaurant was not busy. The server (by the way is the manager, Michelle) was very condescending and lacked any customer service skills.   We asked for prices on a couple of items and were given the wrong prices - one being the cucumber salad.  Apparently, you don't get the complimentary cucumber salad unless you sit at the sushi bar even though we ordered sushi rolls for our table. The salad took longer than normal to arrive as they had to make 'fresh' salad because the current batch was no longer edible. I didn't need to know that.  Salad finally arrived but tasted like a cucumber as there was not time for vinegar, sugar and salt to soak in the flavor.  The chicken in the teriyaki bowl was raw. When we brought it to the manger's attention (again she was our slow server), she had to call the owner for direction as to how to handle the situation. The manger eventually came back to our table and said 'so what's up'?  Really?!  I had to explain again about the raw chicken. She offered us a half order of chicken to compensate for the raw chicken that was served to us. I don't think so! One raw chicken is enough. I asked if we could get a discount off the item and was denied a couple dollars back into my pocket.  Business must be slow, I wonder why? Needless to say, I will NEVER eat there again and DO NOT recommend this restaurant to anyone! (I think that it's pretty bad when you pull up yelp and most of the negative reviews are about one woman in particular hmm...)",

The quality of the sushi wasn't anything spectacular either, there are easily many different places nearby that are tastier and offer much less of a wait. Do not go.",

We arrived at the restaurant and the guy who greeted us said, \"there's an open table in the back\" and we sat ourselves. Our server (who appeared to a teenager) took our order. We ordered an appetizer that never came. We ordered a sushi roll and a steak dish. After waiting 30min they brought the steak dish. It looked nothing like the picture. The picture showed the steak dinner coming with 3 different sauces, salad, soup, veggies and rice. All that was given to me was steak, rice and some veggies.  When the sushi roll finally came to the table is was drenched in the sauce, so my husband couldn't even enjoy the roll. Our server never came back to check on us, he wasn't even the one that brought the food. We asked another worker for the soup, salad, sauces and appetizer we ordered. He brought the soup and one sauce. I showed him the picture and asked him what the sauces were in the picture, he said he did not know and would ask the kitchen. He came back with one other sauce, none of which looked like the sauces pictured. I asked him if I was still going to be getting my salad and the appetizer, he said yes he will ask for it. The salad arrived a few minutes later and the appetizer arrived after we finished our meals.   Our original server showed up at the end and gave us the bill. We didn't even want to go through the hassle of using the Groupon, we just paid with cash and left. We heard people at the tables around us complaining as well about their orders and the service.   The food was subpar, not good enough to have to deal with the horrible customer service. Wasted money on the Groupon and the meal.",

We called when we were on our way because I just feel like it's easier for them if they have an idea who's coming in the door, plus I hate waiting for food Lol We were sat right away and service started within 10 minutes.  The salad was perfect! Very fresh and the dressing was awesome, one of the best I've ever had. The miso was good too.   I had the filet w a side of scallops, which I wasn't sure if 4oz of scallops would be enough but it was plenty.  The chef had crazy knife juggling skills, very impressive. It was sort of memorizing watching him cook the rice. The timing of the food could have been a bit better, the rice came 5 min before vegetables, then scallops another 8 min, and finally my filet about 10 min after that. I like to eat it all together, and of course I expect some lag between, but it seemed more than I'm used to and was a lil frustrating at the time (you know, when I was hangry). But all said and done I was able to portion it out well and came home with a whole nother complete meal with equal amounts scallops and meat. The meat was cooked perfectly and melted in my mouth. The scallops were also cooked perfectly and were so delicious, way better than I expected even.   We originally went to another spot but left because of the wait, when we sat down at Sushi-Ko we said we'd try the other place next time; but after this meal I'm not sure I want to bother going anywhere else (although, I do wish they had more than just saki on their cocktail menu)",

We also enjoy the garlic edamame (although we think it would be better if the garlic was roasted/satued a little bit). Service was both a little hit and miss for our second visit. But our waitress seemed like she might have just been stressed out some. Next visit we will have to try the teppan. The chef (I think he may be the owner?) was having a blast.   Also, I wanted to thank the staff as a whole. I ordered a yakisoba. I generally favor sweeter yakis, so this one was more acidic then I am used to. I don't know if that was intentional or not. I figured it was just the way they cooked it, and was fine to just eat the cost, and just order different next time. However, the staff comped me on it. Very unexpected, and welcome. I tipped an extra $5 though. That was one of the moments of service that made sure the review stayed at 5 stars instead of 4.  Thank you very much Sush-ko!",

    "text": "I ordered delivery from this sushi restaurant a couple weeks ago. I ordered the Lisa Lisa roll, Da Bomb roll, the Popcorn lobster roll and an order of rock shrimp. The Lisa Lisa and Da Bomb roll were pretty tasty and the size of the rolls were great. I loved the rock shrimp as it still had crunch even after it was delivered. The only problem I had was with the most expensive roll I ordered which was the Popcorn Lobster roll. I understand it's \"popcorn\" size, but it was way beyond smaller than I think it was supposed to be. They were so tiny I tasted nothing but the batter and they just compromised the overall taste of the roll.",

The choices were standard, we chose the steak and shrimp entree. We waited for 20 mins for the other guests to arrive, they were late. If you order the Hibachi dinner, prepare yourself to wait for the other guests before the cook starts flippin his frying his spatula.  After a few minutes of waiting, he started. The value of the meals, I really don't see it to be worth $80. It felt like they sell $40 worth of groupon and claim its really $80, but its the same value. Just some rice, stake, shrimp, bottle of saki, a small kiddie size veggie salad, and a small bowl of miso soup. The guy cooking the Hibachi meal didnt seem to be happy to be there too. I understand your tired and all from whole day shift, but they should be sensitive about the impression they provide first time customers who are feeling them out.  Mediocre food, customer service, with a touch of bait and switch for Groupon makes this place a once in a lifetime experience. Yeah, never coming back.",

    "text": "As others have said, I stopped in here after receiving a discount coupon- sign up for their email group to get one yourself, or use their current Yelp deal. Once the discount got me in the door, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality and service.  Specials board on the back wall alerted us to fresh sashimi options- selected a 9-piece sampler with two oysters, for $15. The mixed shrimp and veggie tempura platter was a large portion, served hot and fresh out of the fryer. Batter was thin, oil was fresh, veggies were crisp, more than fair for $9. But the rolls really surprised us: Firestarter and Little Tokyo were both large, fresh rolls, with tasty sauces. I'd come back for more of their specialty rolls.  I was genuinely surprised to have such a positive experience, given the mixed reviews and the discounts available. Regular pricing is a bit high, but the fish is fresh and the dishes are well-prepared. Many of the lower reviews seem to be posted by former fans of the previous ownership- maybe this spot used to be even better, but my experience was worth 4 solid stars.",

    "text": "Living up in the Northwest I'm having a hard time finding good Sushi and I'm psyched that I tried Sushi-Ko!  My wife found a Groupon which was a decent deal so we decided to go.  The Groupon included a sushi meal for 2 ($35) which included 2 drinks, a specialty roll, 2 orders of nigiri sushi (4 pieces total), a classic roll, house fried rice, and lastly a banana harumaki.  To start the establishment was in a small strip mall visibility to the street.  The restaurant 1/3 hibachi, 1/3 sushi bar, and 1/3 dining.  The modest environment had huge painted canvases of hibachi and sushi chefs which I thought were fun.  Whoever picked the music playlist had it on some great 80's/90's pop.  The service was very memorable!  The staff had a lot of knowledge of their menu.  I'm normally reluctant to Groupon but the staff had the Groupon menus prepared and t was straight forward.  The waiter always had our waters full and they were always proactive.  I can't say the place felt on high end but the service was reflective of that.  Now on to the food.  The specialty roll we got was awesome!  Unfortunately, I don't remember what it was called so I can't elaborate on it much.  But, my favorite part was the Nigiri Tuna and Albacore.  The pieces were fat and fresh.  There's a reason they don't do All You Can Eat and it's because the fish was high quality!  I thought the fried rice would be a filler just to help them make up margins on their Groupon.  But it was so good!  There were pieces of chicken, steak, and shrimp mixed with egg and other fried rice ingredients.  Lastly, we ordered an additional Mayo Shrimp meal that was not on the Groupon manu.  I highly recommend it!  The desert was a deep fried banana with a lemon sorbet.  It was good but thought it would match much better with a vanilla ice cream.     Over all, this place was solid!  I'll add it to my list of \"I'm starving but don't wanna cook\" favorite restaurants.  I have yet to try the hibachi but based on the taste of the fried rice I had I wouldn't flinch.  If you haven't tried Sushi Ko and live in the Northhwest it is an awesome spot that deserves loyal patrons!",

Once we were seated and the chef came to cook, he had to cook for both sides of the grill moving back and forth. We didn't get the \"hibachi\" show. The chef was so overwhelmed that he overcooked everyone's steak and undercooked another persons fish. He added vegetables to another patrons rice when she specifically asked for none. By the time we got our full meals the rice was cold. This should have never happened. When we spoke with the owner, he had an \"oh well\" attitude. He said he took the appetizers off and that's all he did for us.. He never said he was sorry or anything. Bottom line, they care more about the money than the customers and the experience they have.",

For how much our bill came out to and the fact I didn't really like most of my food I think the price was a bit inflated.

We decided on Sushi-ko since we were on that side of town at that time, and I regret nothing.  My friends ordered the crispy calamari and white tuna nigiri, while I got the unagi roll. I mainly got it because the combination of the eel and its sauce sounded interesting to me. I did not expect my mind to be blown. If you come here and just order one thing, order the unagi nigiri. It is SO good, I got a second order of it before the night was over.  Whoever makes the sushi really knows his stuff. I read that the sauces are done from scratch. If that is True, the sushi chef here is truly amazing. When I got my roll, the sauce tasted amazing, rich, and had just the right flavor. Forget soy sauce, these rolls are perfect the way they are served! (Nigiri is another story, haha)  Since we didn't get any of the non-sushi entrees, I can't really judge them on it, but I wouldn't mind trying some next time we're here. It was a good night well-spent.",

He didn't really show off that much, and when he did it wasn't anything special. And I know nobody's perfect, but, he did throw a knife on accident. So I would say definitely go for the sushi, not for the hibachi. (RECOMMENDATIONS: Jalapeno Sashimi and the Marilyn Monroll!)",

The place looks small but intimate. There were 2 other tables which one was getting ready to leave. The hostess offered me a seat and the menu.  All the sushi places I've been to so far offered half rolls. So I wanted this too so I could have more of a variety. Not an option. Ok...so I ordered the Marilyn mon-roll.  I waited. And waited. And waited. By now I'm the only customer in the restaurant. I had to ask someone to check with the chef about my ONE ROLL. I noticed the chef looking at the menu. Maybe he forgot how to make it?? 30 minutes later I left with sushi in hand. The hostess Said on my way out...\" you came on a good day \". Sarcasm or just plain rude?? The sushi was good tho. Ordered it a couple days later again. ( i called my order in that time)",

We were told to choose any table and our waitress would be with us shortly. We were greeted by a pleasant waitress, who informed us we were there during happy hour and could order anything on the regular or Tapa menu with our Groupon. This was a big plus considering most places have restrictions. Our party of four shared fried calamari, Marilyn-Mon Roll, Lisa Lisa, Hot Night, King Cobra, California, and for desert the trio assortment! Geez, we were treated like family. The whole staff kept checking on us to make sure everything was okay, our water glasses were full and the dirty plates were cleared from the table right away. I haven't had service like this, in a very long time, and was thoroughly impressed! The food was delicious, the prices were great and the service was excellent! We will definitely be back again, real soon!",

    "text": "MMM MMM GOOD!  Now that's some yummy sushi!   On my lunch break I had originally planned to check out this Indian restaurant around the corner, but alas, they were closed.  I started to head to some fast food and I spotted this little gem.  boy oh boy I'm glad I did!    Not gonna lie, I was slightly worried before walking in that I was going to spend an hour and half here to get seated, order, eat, and pay (happens A LOT at sushi joints); however, that was so not the case. *smiles big*  I was sat down at the sushi bar within 30 seconds of walking in and given a cucumber salad (FREE) and my beverage within 2 minutes of sitting down.  Then, I took a gander at the glorious menu!   The menu had wonderful pictures to accommodate the majority of the rolls that were offered on the sushi list which made happier than a pig in...well you know :)  I found something that sounded and looked appeasing and put in the order.  Within about 6 minutes my delicious looking rolls sat before me in all their glory, needless to say I dived in an attacked them! The red caterpillar roll (which I added spicy mayo on top of) was so fresh, and ever so tasty; I was so thrilled to discover their spicy mayo didn't taste like something that fell off the back of truck and sat in the sun for days.  The spicy tuna roll was as expected, fresh with a nice little kick!   I got my bill, paid, got my change and was out of there in a flash.  The entire process was less than 30 minutes cost about 15$ and was worth every yummy bite.  Don't pass this place up, who knows maybe I'll see ya there next time!",

    "text": "It's only been one time but we know we will be regulars! The less than $7 add outside drew me in but my fiance and I ended up ordering the 3 item dinner special ($16) which is worth it since the 2 item is $13. Their teriyaki sauce is thick and doesn't have an overpowering flavor like other places. Chicken is tender and juicy. Beef isn't dry like what we experienced at the nearby Osaka. Salmon teriyaki was good too! Yakitori - with grilled onion - yuuuum!   We also eyed the family at the teppan grill and the chef was entertaining and friendly. Overheard that he came from Nobu - must be good! Their food also looked good and we will be sure to try that and review it next:)   For their price the amount of food offered is well worth it because we had a second dinner to take home:P Staff is very attentive and friendly. Love it here!  ++Update: Had my second go today but this time I called in a pick up order after work.  They have an awesome lunch menu which is the same as the dinner specials but for a couple bucks less and maybe 2-3 items less than dinner (I just noticed because I got yakitori but for lunch its not on the special..you can order it full price 2 pcs for $4 or something).  The amount of food you get for the 2 item lunch special is huuuuge for the price of $9.  It even comes with the soup!! Other places get lazy and don't include soup on take out.  Horrray Sushi-ko!!",

Place was pretty full which is always a good sign. They have a separate menu for Groupon. Choices on menu did not appear to be enough for two; however, I was proven wrong. The fried rice was brought out almost immediately and it is amaze balls. Deal came with two choices of nigiri and the yellowtail was delicious. We also ordered a California Roll as part of the deal and it tasted as you would expect. They allow a premium roll as well and we ordered the Rattlesnack. That thing was huge! We ordered a Japanese Lasagna on the side and they didn't fail there either. Overall, service was great and food was great as well. Only reason they got 4 stars was because we ordered soy paper and the sushi was brought out with seaweed anyways.",

She's the main reason we keep coming back to this place. Melody always has an upbeat attitude and provides quick efficient service, she always makes sure our order is served correctly, and our cups are kept full. Thanks Melody!   The negatives: the other waitresses seem to be a \"revolving door\" here and don't seem to provide the personable and memorable experience Melody does, however it's not the worst service I've ever had at a restaurant. With the exception of the sushi chefs the kitchen staff seems to be a bit slow on getting the orders out. Lastly on more than one occasion I have seen the owner getting drunk here and while it's nice to see an owner present in his restaurant I find it very unprofessional to see an owner knocking back drinks in his restaurant when he should be managing his staff.   All in all I recommend Sushi Ko if your in the area as my wife and I enjoy this place.",

Well we ate there so much and kinda wore it out.  Unfortunately Sushi Loca opened up not too far away and I think it stole all its customers.  Friday night we thought we would give Sushi Ko another chance.  The place was pretty empty for a Friday night.  Tepanyaki tables only had one couple sitting there....looked so sad.  The food was pretty bland.  We ordered fried rice-bland, teriyaki beef-teriyaki was so sweet :( and a couple rolls-one 911 with the tempura on the outside...left your mouth waxy.  The only way to explain it.  Anyways, needless to say it was a \"blah\" visit.  Probably wont go back till I forgot how \"blah\" it was.    Like I said, something happened to the place-new owners? Sushi Loca down the way?  Either way not sure if we will be back any time soon...unfortunate.",

It used to be a go to dinner place for us at least once or twice a week, now, only if it's take out and even then I am not sure about it anymore.. They get two stars instead of one only because their food is always great, but hey, if you are looking for a playground where you can eat sushi, this is the place you want. Every time we went there, there were SOOOO many children with hungry and distracted parents, not paying attention to their kids disrespectful behavior to others, it's crazy. Kids screaming, crying, oh, and the clown making them squeaky balloons to play with does not help the situation at all. Not a good atmosphere for child-free adults. Also, the place doesn't really seem to appreciate return business. Our last straw there was when the waitress brought us two oyster shooters that we didn't order, which we informed her of, but she didn't really seem to know who they belonged to so we offered to keep them. When the bill came, she charged us for the shooters she brought that we didn't order. Before this happened, Sushi-ko wasn't only our go to sushi place, my boyfriend had several business dinners there with his partners worth a very significant amount, we don't anymore and will not until the servers are trained properly, know what their doing and until that clown is out of there. Clowns are for circus, not sushi bars.",

We reserved the habachi table for 13 people two days prior to the evening we were planning on going with no issues. We show up with half of our party, and not even ten minutes later do they sit another party at our table taking the seats we reserved. We attempted to talk to the waiter, but were advised they would be really quick so this wouldn't be a problem. A few minutes later the rest of our party arrives with nowhere to sit. After some discussion we were moved to the other habachi table that had been closed for the evening. We were at the table five minutes when a ROACH skitters across the habachi table. When we let the waiter know he didn't seem too fazed.  Since there were so many of us we stayed, against our best judgement. We weren't offered any sort of compensation for what we had gone through or witnessed. Not even an apology. I'm just appalled, especially since I had been such a huge fan of them previously. Would not recommend.",

There hours said open until 11 but as the first group of us arrived at 10 we were informed that they were closing because it was Sunday. When we pointed out that it was actually Saturday they said oh let me check.... To be extra clear there were two sushi chefs standing at the bar and two clients eating at the bar. There were also several tables of customers. The host returned from the kitchen and said \"sorry today was their monthly cleaning day\" and they had already closed the kitchen. So they turned us away and several other couples that were arriving behind us. Several people in my group said they will never go back. If you're going to close your restaurant early at least post a sign on the door. Being turned away by the  staff when people are clearly in the restaurant still enjoying their meals and we were well ahead of your posted hours felt terrible.",
