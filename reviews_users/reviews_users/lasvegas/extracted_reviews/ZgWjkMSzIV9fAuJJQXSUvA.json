    "text": "Worst Greek food I've ever had. Me and my husband love Mediterranean food and eat it very often. After seeing some reviews we decided to visit this place. The chicken and lamb skewers were dry and flavourless. The Greek salad was okay. The tzatziki had no garlic or cucumber and was basically dill mixed with yogurt. We ordered falafel and it was way too salty. The pumpkin baklava cheesecake was the only thing that was good. The service was good. The price is high considering the sub standard food they serve. Definitely not worth another visit. And definitely not \"homemade\" Greek food.",

    "text": "I may not be an expert on greek food, but I know the difference between a great gyro and a gyro I would not want to eat again. There's an array of Mediterranean restaurants within miles that are much much more impressive.   The meat in the gyro seems like a very poor version of pressed lamb and beef. You are probably better of picking up frozen gyro meat from the local grocery store and making your own.  I'm used to gyros being served with tzatziki sauce, here it's served with a \"yogurt dill\" sauce which is a nice twist, it just doesn't make up for the poor quality of meat.   My wife got the pomegranate chicken, and I have to admit, it seemed like it had been marinated and poached in POM juice. It was overly sweet without any depth or any presence of seasoning.     Pros: Friendly staff, reasonable prices Cons: Poor quality meat, not alot of flavor, hummus was just blah.   Overall: I will not be returning to Market Grille Cafe for any reason.",

I am not sure why they have a low rating. I truly love their food.  If you want fancy greek dishes go somewhere else. This is mamaMs kitchen that serves Greek comfort food. I will definitely dine here regularly. Tips: try the tenderloin skewers, lamb gyro, fries, pumpkin soup and their desserts.",

Once I got in I was a little confused because I didn't realize it wasn't a sit down and order type place. Instead you go up to the counter place your order, take a seat, and your order comes out to you. So I start looking over the menu I see the familiar mediterranean fair, but I notice a difference. They make their hummus and baba ganoush with yogurt. Instant turn off.  Despite this I decide to give the place a chance and I order a vegetable skewer and plato's potatoes. Turn's out plato's potatoes is just french fries with another name. I think ate two or three and gave up. The vegetable skewer was pretty decent and actually had a hunk of peach in it, which was a nice twist. Unfortunately that was not enough to make up for everything else.",

    "text": "Cheese. No, not on the menu. This whole place. But in a good way.  The moment you walk into MGC, you enter a world that seems very similar to \"My Big Fat Greek Wedding\" or the Mad Greek Cafe in Baker. Lots of Greek decor, and no shortage of Greek music. A great place to be a Greek Geek.  Having said all that, this place is a fun spot to grab a nice, delicious dinner with your pals. You order from a counter, and food is brought to your table.  Lots of items for those with varied palates. Plenty of vegetarian items, white meat, red meat, seafood, etc.   I recommend the appetizer combo (usually the kiss of death at most restaurants due to fried disgusting nothingness). Pita bread, hummus, tabouli, salad, falafel and dolmades (stuffed grape leaves). Share it with friends. Don't be that guy (or girl).  Service is good, bathrooms are clean. All these things are important.   This place is worth a second, third or fourth visit. Maybe more.   I've never tried it, but they are known for their Pomegranate Chicken. I guess this means that I get to go back! Holler.  Just make sure you can tolerate the Greeki-ness of the place. I know I can :)",

    "text": "I stopped by here for a quick lunch on a Sunday. When you walk in you will find the menu on the wall on the left side. I was greeted by a friendly server at the cash register. I went with the Chicken gyro platter & drink which was $14.40. The price seems expensive to me for what you get with the meal. I thought the chicken gyro was a little short on the chicken and had too much lettuce. I'm used to going to places where there is so much chicken in the gyro that it is constantly falling out while eating your meal. The taste of the gyro was very good but disappointing from the lack of chicken. The platter includes a side Greek salad and rice. I especially liked the added touch of small pieces of grape leaves mixed into the rice. The drink fountain has several choices of sodas and two different freshly made iced tea options. The restaurant was very clean. There was a constant stream of friendly employees walking to by your table to make sure everything was okay. I would recommend this place for a quick meal. I'll give it another shot in the future to see if there is other meals that offer better value.",

I do so love their Gryo salads and Gyro platters, they are huge and bring a smile to my face.  The Gyros are definitely the best in the area.  If you tip the wait staff they yell \"Opa!\", although the first time they did it felt like I was going to get into the Greek version of \"thunderdome\".  The food is a little on the pricey side but its delicious so I won't complaint.  Last time I was their I saw they have some kind of flaming cheese appetizer.  My inner pyro maniac is dying to try this dish, so I will definitely be heading back there.",

Called in and ordered the      Lentil soup     Pomegranate chicken spinach salad     Greek trio platter      Baklava When I arrived the order was ready.  The girl behind the counter was friendly and very thorough on making sure my Order was correct.  I mean every single item was checked. I appreciate that considering once you leave coming back is a real pain for take out.    Food?  Well it was delicious!  Lentil soup was pretty good.  The trio was awesome.  Salad was nice , humus and pita was good even though I'm not a big fan of that food.  The moussaka was soo good,  the other two I got mixed up. The one with the pasta noodles was also very nice.  The other with spinach was a little over powering.      My fiance had the pomegranate chk salad.  She liked it a lot.  To much spinach for me though.      One thing for sure was the baklava was very good!   So savory. I mean I enjoyed every bit.  So, after this I would say I'm going back for seconds",

My favorite is the spanakopita. If you get the entree size it is a lot of food because it comes with some greek salad, basmati herb rice, hummus and pita bread for about $11. The pomegranate chicken is really good, whether you get it alone, in a salad, or in a wrap. The traditional gyro is also really good, and very large. You can get it with yogurt dill sauce (which I recommend) or hummus. The salmon wrap is excellent, and you can choose a spinach or tomato basil wrap (both great). They sell greek beer and wine, but their soda selection isn't that fantastic. I really wish they would get coke zero (they have diet coke). The desserts are gigantic, and the yia yia's cookies are enough to take back to your office or home to share. The pumpkin baklava cheesecake is to die for! Enough for 2. The service is great, you stand in line to order and it's usually short, and then they bring you your food. The staff is very friendly. If you go on their website there is a coupon for 2 glasses of house wine with a $25 purchase! They have a food slideshow going on a TV you can watch if you want to see what some of the food looks like. To sum it up, I highly recommend this place and I go back often! Oh and BONUS! They have a punch card and after you go 10 times you get $10 off your next check.",

It was a late dinner, about 8pm and the restaurant was pretty empty.   The food... Well it was really just okay. Nothing over the top fabulous, but not terrible. I would highly recommend the lentil soup. It was hearty and delicious...Full of flavor! Please note to all my fellow vegans: THE HUMMUS IS NOT VEGAN. It contains Greek yogurt. Huge disappointment for me. I ordered the veggie skewer meal. It came with a small salad, rice, two small skewers, and about 3table spoons of tabbouleh. They were very accommodating and made sure everything that came out was prepared vegan. The skewers were cooked well and seasoned properly. However, they were mainly just red yellow and green peppers and two mushrooms on each skewer...Lacking vegetables and variety...  The rice was okay, large portion. I left full with left overs, but not satisfied.   The service was okay as well. She was pretty knowledgable about the food items which was a perk for me and my dietary needs. She did forget an entire meal for our table, but none of us really said anything since it didn't make the bill. The appetizer was enough for our friend.   We ordered a bottle of the pomegranate wine. It was sweet and delicious. We finished it easily between the four of us. My boyfriend said his food was okay and my friends didn't take their left overs home... So I'm not sure if that meant it was bad or not. However, they do have a good happy hour I would check out, and for a fast quick semi healthy bite, it really wasn't all that bad.

This is my 400th Review!  Yipee!  Pumpkin Mushroom Soup,  Lemon Rice Soup and a  Moussaka platter-TO GO  Lots of flavor.  The Pumpkin Mushroom soup was  almost the consistency of baby food so not sure if it's suppose to be like this but nonetheless all the flavors of fall.  Lemon Rice Soup one of my favorites-you can order it in a 8oz size (cup) or a larger size.  Small size is only $3.50 and packed with a lemony tangy punch. Perfect for my little one battling a cold.  Moussaka Platter came with a Greek side salad and dressing, warm pita triangles and fabulous hummus which was very tasty, basmati flavorful rice and a \"slice\" of Mousakka which is potato, ground beef and eggplant.  Almost like a cross between a Shephards pie a lasagna.  It was very good.  Just had a corner piece so it was a little crunchy, would have liked a moister center piece instead.  I have been to the Market Grille before (at the location up North) so this was my first time here.  Parking reserved for take-out orders so that was nice.  Friendly service.  Hummus, Greek salad and lemon soup were the standouts!  Open Monday thru Saturday 11 a.m. till 10 p.m.  Sunday noon-8 p.m. Lunch Specials from $7.50 (11 a.m. -3 p.m.) Happy hour everyday from 3-6 pm (dollar off wine, beer and appetizers)  Great deals and great meals found here!  Don't miss this fabulous hidden gem!",

Boyfriend got the traditional gyro (mix of lamb & beef) and he said it was the best gyro he's ever had. The yogurt dill sauce was good & boyfriend said the hummus was too. (I don't like hummus so I can't comment) they had a kids menu & my daughter got the pizza. She said it was good.   Service was great & ambiance is nice too. Ended up paying $27.00 for all three entrees & 2 drinks. Definitely worth it. Of course I forgot to \"check in\" until after we paid so i missed the 20% off deal. But I'm not worried because I know we'll be back again.",

    "text": "Market Grille Cafe is the reason I fell in love with Mediterranean/Greek food. The food is consistently delicious and truly represents a restaurant that serves its customers in the same way I imagine they would serve food to their family.    Here is a list of some of my favorite eats at MGC: Combination Appetizer Platter: Includes hummus, pita bread, mediterranean salad, dolmades, satziki, tabouli, and babaganoush. Can be ordered as appetizer to share and commonly ordered as a meal for individuals. It's hearty, diverse in flavor and texture, and just delicious.   Dolmades: Stuffed grape leaves. I have yet to find any other Greek/Mediterranean joint that makes them as excellent as MGC does. Here you have a choice of vegetarian or with meat. Both are fantastic.  Falafels: This is yet another thing that MGC cooks extraordinarily well that has yet to be matched in quality by any other place. Crispy on the outside yet moist and bready on the inside - it's like a Greek hush puppy but better. An excellent meaty substitute for non-meat eaters.   Also not to miss: Mousaka, Stuffed Tomatoes, Stuffed Green Peppers, all of their grilled skewers (my personal favorite is the salmon).   Still making my way through their entire menu but unfortunately for me, MGC is clear across town. Nonetheless, we still make the trek when the craving for Greek food arises. We met one of the owners by chance during one visit, and pleaded with her and her husband to open another location in the South Las Vegas/Henderson area. In a town that offers every possible type of food and hosts a number of world-renowned culinary venues, Market Grille Cafe easily sits in the top 5 of my list of favorite Las Vegas restaurants.",

Cons: wayyy tooo salty (couldn't even finish food), the food was not fresh (srsly, it looked frozen or made from the day before), and just soo generic.  Nothing special.  Save your money and go somewhere else.  We even gave the desserts a try (pumpkn baklava cheesecake) - once again, it tasted premade or frozen.  Grab some Marie Callender's frozen cheesecake from the grocery store.  I promise it'll taste better.",

We were in heaven as every bite from everything we had was made from the gods! The service was equally on par, admittedly it was a Tuesday and not their busiest night but we were treated like VIP's by both our waitresses, frequently checking on us, bringing more bread, more water, happily taking the time to answer our questions and explain the dishes and how they were all homemade recipe's from scratch. The pomegranate chicken was a 10! The Saganaki was a 10! The lemon chicken and rice soup was a 10! The salad was a 10! The pumpkin cheesecake was a 10! The homey elegant Greek ambiance was a 10! Heck, even the ice water was a 10! *(filtered unlike some other places.) We will definitely be back and I am still feeling good vibes from this place even though I'm stuffed. It was culinary perfection, and I can honestly say that this is one of the few meals in my life where a standing ovation would have been justified! Opa!",

The chicken was good but the romaine lettuce was a bit soggy it wasn't to bad but you can tell it was sitting with the dressing for awhile.  It was during lunch time when I went so maybe they prepared it before hand.  I will be back but I will mention it the next time I come.  Staff are really nice and friendly.",

A presentable establishment is a good first impression to me.   The menus is large and on display against the wall when you walk in and on 3 display boards.   Lunch specials? yes they do! 7.50  for a gyro and drink.   food is good but another greek restaurant will always have my heart. the rice is tender, the chicken gyro is tasty with lots of flavor and hummus is somewhat bland.  we ordered the dessert sampler with your choice of 3 desserts. Canolis,yaya cookies and aphrodites cheesecake. OMG! the aphrodites cheesecake is a must try. cheesecake with a layer of baklava underneath! *drools* haha.",

They have a great lunch special- $8.50 to build your own combo, with choices of pomegranate chicken, gyro, wrap (with choice of meat or falafel) or chicken & veggie skewer and you also choose your side- rice, salad (house or spinach), fries or any soup.   Customer service was great. The establishment is super clean and you can even watch them make your food if you'd like. They had gluten free, dairy free, nut and egg free options available. Good thing, because T Money was with us. Husband got a gyro of course, with a house salad. Looked great with a lot of meat. He ate it all. T and I ordered the chicken skewer. I ordered with a side salad and he got his usual fries. The chicks skewers were fantastic. And our food was brought out very quickly, which is always appreciated when you have a youngin' with you.   I took off a star (and a half) because the allergy friendly options are really, really limited. The different hummus options sounded great, but they all had dairy in them. The falafel wasn't marked as gluten free either... Womp womp. I would go back again if we were in the area and in the mood.",

Definitely will fill you up, and unless your starving you can almost get away with sharing one wrap with a friend. I will say though, their French fries that I had, had way too much seasoning making it super salty. If your sensitive to salt I'd recommend telling them go easy on the seasoning or omit all together.",

Located in the same shopping center as Panera, The Cupcakery and several other stores, entry to Market Grille Cafe sees patrons greeted by an open kitchen and homey confines as the menu spins Mediterranean by way of Greece and Italy, a smaller lunch variety and happy hour specials offered for those dining earlier in the day while more substantial options are reserved for full table service later in the evening.  Certainly more Athenian than Roman, though the similarities between dishes like Mousaka and Lasagna should seem fairly obvious to most, it was with an in-training server that the evening got under way as Iced Tea and Water were served to those at the table, the place fairly busy for 7:00 on a Saturday evening with all sorts of ages, genders and races represented in the crowd.  Encouraged to order in courses, most everything but the warmed Pita reportedly made in-house, it was with $5.50 small orders of Hummus next to creamy Eggplant puree with Garlic that the meal got started, the former a bit thinner than most of those previously tasted but at the same time full of flavor while the Babaganoush was far more chunky with a slight bit of smokiness left to linger in the mouth.  Not particularly wanting to over-order, the low prices actually quite deceiving for large plates when compared to the likes of Hummus Factory or Mykonos in Sun City, entrees were limited to just a trio of Greek favorites plus a few 'sides' including tender Gyro Meat and a quartet of \"Greek Meatballs\" (as described on the menu,) the Golfball sized Falafel our meal's only dud as ground Chickpea Fritters lacked any particular flavor on their own, save for that of the Oil.  Impressed by both the layered eggplant Mousaka with rich Beef Ragu, Spanakopita also quite nice with sheets of Phyllo interspersed by Spinach and springy Cheese, Pastitsio unfortunately seemed to be a bit overwhelmed with Cinnamon that completely overwhelmed both the Noodles and the other ingredients, far better bites found in two desserts including a generous slice of Baklava with plenty of Nuts and Honey plus a bowl of chilled Rice Pudding that embraced the grains texture rather than acting to completely hide it.  **** One of the more traditional Mediterranean menus in town, the limited Italian options seemingly just there because they are easy to make from ingredients commonly used in Greek cuisine, Market Grille Cafe offers good food at a fair price with plenty of vegetarian or more healthful options in an atmosphere that family friendly, but still nice enough to qualify for date night.",

Most importantly our server did this without making me feel like I was being talked down to, which is enough to make me come back. After placing our order our food came in a timely manner, which itself was excellent. It is clear that there is care and love put into every ingredient of every dish. The food was vibrant and flavorful. I ordered all vegetarian items but I did not miss not having meat. That being said, the care put into the vegetarian dishes makes me confident that there nonvegetaian selections are just as good. Best of all the food comes in generous portions and are fairly priced. I visited the Summerlin location and I will definatly be back for future dinning.",

They have vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-fee options, which is awesome if you are eating with friends with dietary restrictions. The veggie kabobs are my all-time favorite, along with the rice (not vegetarian). The lentil soup is the best I have ever had, and the baklava pumpkin cheese cake is light and tasty.   Note: It does not have a distinct cheesecake flavor, but it's excellent in it's own right.   One of the best things about this place is the pictures of the food. They truly represent what you will get and are great help in making up your mind. The place is family-owned and operated, and they really do care about the quality and your experience.   I gave it 4-stars because, as tasty as things are, they are a little heavy handed on the salt, which will bother some.

    "text": "AMAZING!!!!!  After 6 months in Las Vegas, and eating at many restaurants in the area, from local hole-in-the-wall places to the best $$$$ downtown establishments, THIS place, \"Market Grille Cafe\" is our FAVORITE by far!!!  Why?  Well, for starters it has a very nice, relaxed atmosphere.  The inside gives you a definite, casual mediterranean atmosphere.  Gentle, clear white lights, like large Christmas bulbs, are strung across the ceiling.  The decor definitely feeling like a sidewalk cafe in Greece or Italy.  They do have some outside cafe tables as well and overhead misting to keep you cool.  The staff is very friendly, attentive, and helpful.  You realize quickly that this is not only family owned and run, but that they treat you as family too!  They take the time to explain any menu items (since some terms may be Greek to you, LOL!) and also make suggestions based on what's popular, your dietary needs, and of course what their signature dishes are.  Although everything was unique, flavorful, and perfectly prepared, from the appetizers to the desserts, the most amazing, most unique, most original, most flavorful dish is their   POMEGRANATE CHICKEN IS TO DIE FOR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I cannot overstate how incredible this dish is!  Its what has won them awards and its no wonder why.  Even if you're not sure you like pomegranate, YOU'LL LOVE THIS!!!!  Remember how you felt after you first, well, you know?  THAT'S what this is like from the first bite!  OOH! AAH! OMG! YES! YES! YES!!!  Seriously, its that new, that refreshing, that new, that unbelievable, leaving you a bit dazed and confused at first, but soon finding yourself desiring more, more, MORE!!!  Yes, I really do think their Pomegranate Chicken is THAT good!  I even told the artist/creator/chef son that he should go on TV against Bobby Flay.  Pomegranate Chicken would knock Bobby out for certain!  We also liked that the owners came out to chat with their guests, both about the food and as friends/family.  It was easy to forget we were customers.  I could go on and on (obviously, lol), but let me just say once again that this was our BEST DINING & FOOD experience in Las Vegas after 6 months here!  The quality of the food is impeccable, original FAMILY secret recipes, relaxed vacation atmosphere, yet a strong, warm feeling of family, community and togetherness thanks to the owners and staff.   Well done Market Grille Cafe, well done!  *F*I*V*E* STARS!!!!!",

My son is moving here soon for a residency program and Im so grateful that delicious, healthy food is so local. Oh, forgot to mention the staff was fantastic as well, very patient with a newby like me and just nice overall. FYI...I only take the time to write really GREAT reviews or really poor ones.

The veggies are incredibly fresh, just like Greece!  All other ingredients are deliciously homemade and made to order.  Even so, service is fast and friendly.  The owner was a total sweetheart and happened to be (wo)manning the register when I ordered.

    "text": "Here's the problem: the meal was tasty, the staff and service nice as well. But my wife and got got wicked sick from the food. My bathroom time for the next 3 days was as liquified as the hummus and looked just like the babaganoug. I hate to spend time and money on food that makes me unable to eat anything for days after!  I liked the cafe style setup. Why not? Order at the front, get your cup and wait for the food to be delivered. The staff was helpful, the ambiance kitchy but it is a greek place so I should have expected crappy murals of the Parthenon and fake grapevines.  We ordered the mezza platter and the traditional gyro. The platter came with hummus, baba, romaine salad, falafel and grape leaves (we ordered 2 hot with lamb and 1 gold veggie.) All in all the apps were ok. I make way better hummus at home. Their's was VERY loose. Too much water, overpowered by garlic as well. The babaganoug lacked any smokiness. I wonder if they grilled the eggplant? it almost tasted canned. The rest was ok. Salad was sloppy, the grapeleaves good and the falafel nice and crispy. The toasted pita tasted fresh too.  The gyro was an inyourface suckerpunch of greek flavors. Very high in sodium, but went down well with a side of extra tzaziki. I like gyros but often get tired of too much going on in the meat. it was bordering on over seasoned/oversalted. Maybe it's just me.  The manager and staff came by to offer refills, check on the food, and clear the plates. They were all very nice.  Then the thunder struck. Both of us got hit hard at the same time in 2 separate locations. Poor Sarie was at WORK when she felt the bubble guts! I at least was at home and could sit on the pot for an hour. The next three days were very sketchy for me on my motorcycle. Lets just say there were more than a few unscheduled stops on my routes to look for a bathroom.  I'm gonna take a while before I try this place again. Maybe next time get everything cooked extra well done and stay away from the cold apps and fresh veggies/fruit.",

    "text": "This restaurant has a fair amount of positive reviews, so I have to wonder if folks in Vegas haven't had an opportunity to experience high quality Greek food.    We started off with the saganaki and the greek salad.  The saganaki portion was on the smallish side for the ten dollar price point.  It was a fairly standard saganaki - tasted fine.  The greek salad, however, was a huge disappointment.  The salad was terribly stingy on the feta cheese and the vinaigrette had a strange flavor.  It was homemade, but they overpowered it with dried herbs (thyme and basil) instead of using fresh herbs.  Perhaps we just had a poorly made batch, but the flavor was unpleasant.  Our entrees were a gyro and a meatball \"pizza\" made on a pita.  The pizza thing was a stupid choice - I had the lowest of expectations yet I was still disappointed.  It reminded me of something you would receive as the hot lunch selection in a grade school cafeteria.  It's inexplicable why this is on their menu.    The gyro was mediocre at best.  The pita was soft, the cucumber sauce had nice flavor, but the meat was dry and unappetizing.  They also didn't slice the robust portion of gyro meat I'm accustomed to receiving at most Greek restaurants.      To be honest, the best thing we ordered was the grilled chicken breast and french fries for our three year old.  The fries were hot and crisp and the chicken breast was moist and well cooked.    The service was excellent.  Everyone was pleasant and attentive.  The ambiance in the restaurant was fairly typical for a Greek restaurant, however not as tacky as some.  Fair to say it has a nice atmosphere.    As we were presented our check, we showed a ten dollar off coupon we had on our phone.  Our server told us they would not accept it because we hadn't printed it out.  Seriously?  They really need the paper print out?  It was the perfect capper to a very disappointing experience.",

    "text": "I really wanted to like this place; it's five minutes from my house. Unfortunately, Market Grille Cafe just doesn't have very good food. The prices are also pretty ballsy considering its a step up from a fast food joint. I felt really ripped off by the end of the meal.  No pita with the soup, salad and appetizer. (Why?) We had a lovely feta cheese appetizer that we just stared at until our meals showed up. When the pita finally made an appearance at the table, it was four tiny wedges on the plate with the entree.   The avgolemono soup was pretty good; lots of chicken, not a lot of rice. The salad that comes with the entrees is also fine, just a little heavy on the dressing. Unfortunately, the starters were the highlights of the meal.    I actually had to spit out my one bite of spanakopita, it was THAT GROSS. It tasted as though it had been made days ago and had surprise inner layers of mushy phyllo. Stale and inedible; I'd have sent it back if my husband hadn't eaten it (I don't think he liked it either, but he's a 'clean your plate' type).   The hummus and tzatziki were disappointing. Both had an off taste and didn't seem fresh. The filet skewers were pretty rare, rarer than I would have liked if they'd bothered to ask. The rareness wouldn't have fazed me if the meat had been fresh and of good quality, but, like much of what we ordered, it seemed as though it had been sitting around a few days. They're also selling what amounts to a lunch portion at other places at a dinner price. If you're going to overcharge for three bites of meat, it'd better be delicious, you know? I skipped dessert; they'd gotten enough of our money already.   I may or may not come back here. I'm willing to believe they were having an off night and try ordering something else (never again for the spanakopita though, I'm nauseated just thinking about it), maybe a lunch special. In spite of their convenient location, Market Grille can't touch my other Greek spots.",

Maybe it's because I make Armenian food similar to how we taught the Greeks way back when (to any Greek's reading this, I love you, but you know it's True) so I'm a bit more critical than most. The dinner salad not so good. The Sarma, aka dolmadas/stuffed grape leaves, really salty. The gyros - what kind of tasteless, funky meat is that? Cat? Anyway, the BEST WAIT STAFF EVER still can't overcome the food issues. The avgolemono soup was absolutely delicious one day and then salty the next. Obviously, one of the cooks love salt. Lots and lots of salt. I'm getting thirsty just writing this. A sea of salt. I will go back and ask for no salt.",

    "text": "I LOVE Mediterranean food. I love gyro. So already, you can't go wrong when you  go to a greek family owned restaurant!  But the thing I absolutely have to review is their Saganaki appetizer. Their description is: \"greek imported cheese, simmered with lemon & brandy. Served tableside on a \"flaming\" iron skillet\". But what they should have said is: \"heaven in your mouth\".  This dish is such an explosion of flavor. It's a savory and a little tangy, and absolutely perfect. I could NOT stop commenting how wonderful it was with every bite. Even while I was eating, I was worried that soon the dish was going to be done. There is no way I can possibly describe this dish to it's full potential, so I highly recommend everyone to just go try it for themselves!  I was so happy I randomly ordered this dish. After I tried it the first time, I had to go back with a friend only ONE WEEK later to make them try it too! Happily, she also really enjoyed it.  I will review the other foods there another time, but this post is dedicated to my all time new favorite dish anywhere: Saganaki!",

There were lots of pick-up orders while we were waiting, but the dine-in area didn't fill up until 6:15 or so.  Initial service was prompt, taking our order was a little slow, but once placed the wine, beer and food came quickly.  The saganaki came, was flamed tableside and is delicious!  Our granddaughter had never had it before and, like us, loved it!  The rosemary-olive oil pita bread is to die for, crisp and flavorful, and is a recommended side dish. We had a veggie falafel wrap, a chicken gyro and a gyro meat gyro - all were excellent.  The staff were friendly and attentive after the initial pause in service, and I felt the price point was fair, the portions large.  While I prefer the in-house baked pita at Khoury's, overall I recommend Market Grill highly.",

    "text": "I HAVE NEVER BEEN SO HUMILIATED OR BELITTLED.  This was my first and last time coming here. I was so upset that I had to take a week before writing this review, so that I could be calm and honest about my experience. I came here with Ben S. on the evening of January 17th 2018 at around 7pm. As we walked in we were greeted by the hostess which took us to our table. Our waitress came and offered us drinks, I ordered a hot tea because I was sick and Ben a soda. She asked if we were ready to order, we were not since it was our first time and she didn't seem happy that we were still looking over the menu. It's ok, I didn't mind, we all have bad days, I still smiled and asked for her to come back. Soon a booth over to our right freed up and we asked the hostess if we could move to the booth because I was sick and the cold air from outside was hitting me. A booth would have provided a block from the cold and she was so kind in saying we could move. She helped me move my utensils and my tea over to the booth and we sat down again. Ben and I started talking and within what felt like 10 seconds a woman came charging at us and yelling from half way across the restaurant. \"You guys can't sit here, we were cleaning this table up for someone else!\" I wish I was exaggerating when I say that she came over yelling from half way across the restaurant. I wish I was making it up that she was making us get up and move our stuff to the first table we were at. I wish I could tell you that the tables around us weren't all staring at us as we were forced to walk back to our table. We didn't say anything, maybe because we were in shock as to how we were being treated, we quietly went back to our table and we sat down again. The hostess came over and deeply apologized because she didn't know they were cleaning the table for someone else, someone who had just walked in. Ben looked at her and told her \"Weren't we here first?\" she agreed but it was out of her hands and clearly she was intimidated by the woman who had come over and yelled at us. Soon our waitress came back to take our order, Ben asked her for the woman's name who had yelled at us and we were told it was Shelly. I don't know if it was her real name or not but she was an older caucasian woman with blonde hair who was over by the bar most of the time. Ben then proceeded to ask for the check for our drinks instead of placing a food order. Our waitress said ok without hesitating and came back with the bill. We paid for our drinks and left, on our way out catching a glance at a couple that were nodding their heads in disbelief. What they didn't know was that just two days prior we had experienced a loss in our family and this was the first time we had left the house. It took everything in me not to cry as I got up and left from the utter humiliation and disbelief. So many things went wrong here and nothing was done about it. No one on staff cared that we left except maybe the hostess who was very kind the entire visit. NEVER, EVER is it acceptable to treat a paying customer or any human being for that matter in this way. We were humiliated, sad, angry, and every other feeling you can feel when you are belittled in front of dozens of people. I understand when sometimes a restaurant needs to move people, it's happened to me before but they handled it much differently. By first coming over quietly, then asking if it is ok that we move, then offering something for the trouble. I don't even care they they offer a free dessert or not, it they just ask nicely I will gladly move, but that's just an example of what other places have done. All in all, that is what happened with all honesty and nothing more, nothing less.",

    "text": "If I had wanted fast food, I'd have gone to my local burger takeout joint.  But I didn't; I wanted to enjoy a leisurely dinner with my +1, having just returned home after a solo month on the east coast.  I hadn't been to Market Grille since shortly after they'd opened.  My husband had gone one time after with a friend and wasn't crazy about it, but we were both up for Greek food, so he agreed.  We were seated quickly; I ordered my customary Riesling (very stingy pour for $8.50) and hubby had a glass of Sangria, full of tasteless fruit and missing the kick of additional spirits.  We chose Pomegranate Chicken for me, and Moussaka for him.  He also ordered a bowl of Avgolemono soup.    Salads, which came with the meal, were delivered right away, with small cups of dressing on the side.  The two cups looked like Danny DeVito and Arnold Schwarzenegger in \"Twins.\"  One was a clear golden color, i.e. straight oil.  The other, dark and full of seasonings.  Strike one.  But they changed the pale twin.  It didn't help much - still bland.  Not 20 seconds after the salads hit the table, the soup was delivered.  And right behind that, without missing a beat, came the entrees.  Needless to say, we protested.  And the dishes returned from whence they came, probably to sit under a heat lamp.  The small salad was okay, but quite ordinary, except for the addition of a tiny bit of feta.  The soup had shredded chicken that seemed dry.  Avgolemono should be served with bread, and at every Greek restaurant I've ever eaten in a basket of pita is served at the beginning.  Not here.  The only pita in sight came as three tiny triangles on the entree plate which, if the serving pace had been correct, would have come AFTER the soup was finished.  Chintzy, for sure.  My Pomegranate Chicken looked pretty sitting on that white plate.  It was tender, but strangely tender, since it was also somewhat dry.  A big mound of rice and small cup of okay hummus came with it, along with those three pita bites.  They didn't bother to reheat the rice before re-serving my dish.  Growing up in New York and living in New Jersey, I'm no stranger to Greek, having cut my eyeteeth on Greek diners.  I've had moussaka in Astoria, Queens and in Greece.  And I've never seen a portion as tiny as the one served at Market Grille:  a single half-height layer, and half the width of any portion of moussaka in the free world.  Did hubby mistakenly order a kid's meal?  To make up for the woeful experience, the manager \"graciously\" offered to comp the soup and take 20% off the bill.  But really, it was just the soup that would be adjusted, since anyone checking in on Yelp can get that 20% discount.  Next time I need my Greek/Mediterranean fix, I'll go back to my beloved Crazy Pita, where I can get fresh veggies along with couscous, salad, hummus, and lot more pita for less cash.  And a staff that truly values my business.",

    "text": "Mediterranean dishes come to life here!  Let's begin with why I come here...the pomegranate chicken! This chicken is so moist and marinated in pomegranate juice and herbs, then topped with pomegranate glaze & walnuts. It's on the sweet side but I love it! My man gets my second favorite dish which is the Mama Mia's chicken and it's grilled olive oil-rosemary chicken topped with fig preserve, goat cheese, sun-dried tomatoes and balsamic reduction! Writing this is making me hungry for these dishes right now!  You can pick the perfectly cooked basmati rice or the lemon herb potatoes which are phenomenal. The Greek salads are always fresh and served with a tangy dressing. The soups here are also packed with flavor. I haven't had any that I didn't enjoy. From the avgolemono which is a traditional creamy lemon, chicken & rice soup to the pumpkin or creamy cauliflower ones! All very tasty!  Get 20% off your bill when you check in on Yelp and this is a family owned business that offers very friendly service. We enjoy our visits!",

    "text": "Located in Summerlin/North Las Vegas area, I only go when I'm working and for lunch. It's a pretty popular lunch place from what I've seen and they offer a nice lunch menu. My friend and I go and usually split something off that and get the hummus appetizer to go with it.   I came her for lunch on my birthday a couple months back and the owner happened to be there. She is awesome and so kind. She gave us discount cards for the first timers in the group to come again. She also gave me a slice of their Athena cheesecake. It is cheesecake with a baklava crust. It was good but not my favorite. I am very picky with cheesecake though because my own father makes a killer one from scratch. The baklava crust was lost on me and the others trying it. It just tasted like filo dough and was a bit tough. I'll take my cheesecake and baklava separate and possibly still at the same time.   The hummus is good, great texture and comes in a few different flavors. You can get one or an order of three. We usually just go with the one because it's two of us, but it's plenty. The Greek salad is made with fresh ingredients and is solid, but nothing stands out. They have a pomegranate chicken that is pretty delicious and worth getting if you like that or want to try something new.   The staff are always very friendly and efficient. They are clearing plates immediately and serving your food to the table as soon as it's ready. The kitchen is open so you can what's going on back there if you care to.   I like the ambience, the lunch crowd that isn't too crazy and quality food for an affordable price.",

    "text": "My first day driving my car in Las Vegas 110 degree heat and within 10 minutes, my AC died on me. I haven't had time to get it repaired, and between training, filling out paper works, and driving all over to get errands done, I was doing the Ace Ventura and driving with my head out the window to get some air!  I ended up going a full 24 hours without eating, being very dehydrated, overheated, and sore from training. Not a good idea in retrospect, but such is life. After finally getting a gallon of water in me, I decided to come here for lunch. I welcomed the cold A/C and was sat down right away. The waiter was quick and to the point, and I get my order in right away.   For starters, I had the falafel, that came out with hummus. First thing I tasted was the hummus, and it wasn't good. It was more pasty than creamy, and a jar of sabra hummus was way better than this, which isn't a good sign. The falafel was also doughy on the inside, and had a weird taste to it. Not horrible, but not good.  Next was a greek salad. This was good. Fresh and seasoned just right away. Was a welcome relief from the starter.  For my main, I had the pomegranate chicken entree. This was good too. The chicken was tender and flavorful. Nothing out of this world, but a good dish for sure. The rice that came with it was also good. The pita and hummus where a miss here too, and I just left them.  Finally, I had the aphrodite cheesecake. The idea of a baklava cheesecake was very intriguing, as I love baklava. Unfortunately, this was not a good rendition. The cheesecake was just a standard, run of the mill cheesecake. The baklava crust left a lot to be desired.  Overall, this was okay. But considering that I was starving, my taste buds should have magnified the flavor significantly. Instead, I was very underwhelmed. I won't be coming back. I may have been spoiled by Cleo, which U know is not a fair comparison to a place like this, but this is just too far below to justify coming.",

    "text": "I love their lunch menu! For $8.50 you get to pick a main dish, a side, and you also get a drink.  I almost always get the same exact thing: Mediterranean wrap with gyro meat and no tortilla wrap... Everything on it with yogurt dill sauce, a side Greek salad, and hot sauce on the side. The wrap has rice in it and so \"naked\" it pretty much is like a Chipotle bowl but Mediterranean syle.. lol The manager and cashiers are nice and they never complain or make a big deal about my special requests. The gyro meat doesn't have any weird gamey taste and isn't oily.  If you like lemon then definitely try their avgolemono soup, which has chicken, rice, and lemon!  For lunch, you order at the counter and then they bring your food to the table (like Panera).   Lunch menu: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.marketgrillecafe.com%2F%23%21lunch-menu%2Fc1oy0&s=5c0ef2dbf848db32145e5bcec36c48509f063f76fdd52222595031c411d0f557\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">marketgrillecafe.com/#!l...</a>  HOT TIP: Download the Epoxy App for the loyalty card. Every $10 you spend, gets you a stamp (they round up so you should get a stamp even for the lunch special) and every 10 stamps gets you a $10 credit.",

The first thing that struck me was the prices. I really wanted to spring for a kebab meal, but instead i went for their more economical lunch special. For 7.50 you can get your choice of traditional or chicken gyro, pomegranate chicken salad, or falafel appetizer with a soda. I sprung for the traditional gyro and soda.  It was pretty good. The meat was yummy, but wasn't browned at all. It was as if they sliced it right off the spit and put it on my pita. Still good though. I loved their hummus  and their pitas were very tasty and fresh as well.  Service was friendly too. A+ for the people working there!  Overall, I had a good experience. I can't say I was wowed though. I've definitely had much better mediterranean food, but if you're looking for quick lunch at an economical price, i would suggest this place.",

It is so close to my house I couldn't believe I haven't eaten here before.  Was eating alone so I decided to order to go and just chill at home to try out the food. Now I know most people are going to tell me this effects my dinning experience but whatever.. we are talking about the food here.  Ordered a Falafel wrap with a side Greek salad. I got it with the Tomato Basil wrap and their yogurt dill sauce. When I got home and started chowing down I was highly disappointed. The salad came with Balsamic dressing, yuck. The lettuce seemed grainy like it wasn't washed, and there was barley any feta cheese. The falafel was ok. I don't know if it was the sauce recipe or just the lack of it but the whole thing tasted really dry to me.   Now after all this and being mad that I didn't go somewhere else I still want to go back and try the Combination Platter, and maybe something else. It's a strange reaction but my stomach needs to find a a near by Greek place that reminds of the places back in New York.   So I will someday give it another try and maybe I will change my tune. We will see.",

    "text": "Market Grille has an extensive menu of Greek and Mediterranean dishes that have great taste, and are filling.  Last time I was here I got a filet gyro and it was delicious.  One tip for a gyro if you like the yummy yogurt sauce they will add some extra sauce for I believe a dollar extra.  Each time I come here I try something new.  Which is about once a month.  I have had lamb, gyros, many varieties available, Greek iced coffee, which hits the spot.  For the lamb kabob that I got I thought it was very good however the portion for dinner and for the price I would think two kabob sticks would be more appropriate.  The staff is super friendly and helpful with making a choice for your meal.  So I see on this app for Market Grille something about %20 off your entire bill after you write something?  Well it seems like I sadly could not take advantage of this deal because I like my privacy and do not want to have my location on for all my apps. Market Grille please contact me about how I can get this because me and my family are very loyal customers. Thank you and see you soon!  Ps I dine at the Lake Mead location.",

    "text": "AMAZING BEYOND WORDS.... I will admit that it has taken me longer than it should have to eat at the Market Grille Cafe, and I am sorry it took so long.  Describing the food as incredible just does not do it enough justice.  There are very few places that I have eaten at over my 40+ years that serve food that has so much depth of flavor.    I started with the pumpkin mushroom soup and honestly, I could have just eaten that all day long.  Quite possibly the best soup I have ever had.  I then moved into the entree where I had the pomogranate chicken and it about knocked me out of my chair.  The chicken was so tender, moist and the flavor was intoxicating.  I honestly could have eaten like 10 chicken breasts cooked this way.  Wow, what an amazing treat.  Then to finish off the experience I had the baklava cheesecake.  I was told that this dessert won an award at a food competition and I do not doubt it at all.  It was as lucious as it gets.  What an amazing way to finish.  The experience was basically a food orgasm.    The Market Grille Cafe is a family owned business with two locations in town and the service and hospitality of ALL of the people that work there is just as impressive as the food.  The MGC has it all, atmosphere, hospitality, and most importantly incredible food.  If that was not enough the prices for the food are as economically friendly as it can be.  The MGC is very wallet friendly.  I do not know how they do it for so little but they do. I spend just as much or more for fast food and do not get anything close to this in quality.    I am a huge Gyro fan so my next visit I am definitely going to try one.  I saw someone else having one and asked how it was and they said it was outstanding and the best they ever had.  I cannot say I am surprised.    I urge all of my Yelpers out there to visit the Market Grille Cafe and enjoy the same amazing experience I had.    Run, don't walk and get yourself into the Market Grille Cafe.",

    "text": "Best greek food I have had in Vegas so far.  Great service and clean environment.   Started with the appetizer sampler plate.  Falafel, greek salad, baba ganoush, hummus, and dolmades. The stuffed grape leaves were good.  The inside had so much flavor. The hummus was kinda runny and wasn't that great.  The salad is a salad, not much to say there.  The falafel and the baba ganoush were fantastic.  The falafel was so good.  Not dry whatsoever.  The baba ganoush had a lot of flavor as well.  Great eggplant flavor.   My wife ordered the lamb souvlaki entree. It came with rice and a vegetable skewer.  The rice was okay. The vegetable skewer had a great char on it and a great marinade.  The lamb was excellent.  So flavorful and had a nice lamb taste.  I ordered the entree sampler with spanakopita, moussaka, and a macaroni pie.  The pie was forgettable, but still had some flavor.  The moussaka was very cheesy and the eggplant and tomato sauce was fantastic.  The spanakopita was the best part of the meal.  The phyllo dough was baked to a nice brown color and the spinach inside was so good. It had the right amount of feta cheese to flavor the spinach.   This place is a must try.  If your looking for good greek food, you just found it.",

    "text": "There was a time when I really liked this place, at least this location anyway. But that changed after my last visit. Word to the wise: it doesn't pay to be a Frequent Diner Card holder, at least where the lunch specials are concerned.  I ordered off the lunch specials menu as I have done in the past and when the total came, I remembered that I had my Frequent Diner Card. I pulled it out and noticed I had all 10 punches, so yay me, free lunch, well give or take $1 and some change for the remaining balance. So the cashier called her manager over to get it squared away. The manager came over and after a few seconds of examination, she notified me that I couldn't use the $10 off card because I was ordering off the lunch specials menu which she mumbled something about it being already \"discounted\" and that I needed to use it on an entree instead. I think I gave her a death look and instead of immediately questioning the ridiculousness that she just stated which was NOWHERE WRITTEN ON THE LUNCH SPECIALS MENU NOR IN THE FINE PRINT OF MY FREQUENT DINER CARD, I grabbed my useless card from the manager and paid for my meal. I'm not a complete douchebag after all. It was lunch time, the lines were long, I was hungry, I'm sure the people behind me were hungry so there.    Yet, the more I thought about it, the more irritated I became. I re-read the card just to make sure I didn't miss something. About the only thing I think that would apply is the \"Management reserves all rights\" part. Perhaps her reservation with me being able to use that card, even toward the \"discounted\" lunch specials is that I wasn't paying for more than one lunch special. Then I got to thinking, the last time I came into this place, I ordered off the lunch specials menu and got the10th punch on my card. The card clearly states that you get one puch for every $10 purchase and even after ordering those \"discounted\" lunch specials, with a drink and tax, it comes out to a little over $10. So what's their policy again about using the card toward the lunch specials? Oh right. They don't really have one, do they??  I wanted to say something to the manager who denied me the $10 off but she was nowhere to be found after I was done with my meal and I had to get back to work. I decided to visit the website which is a wealth of information if one is looking to book them for their next event. Unfortunately, there is no comments section, just a card to fill out for catering purposes. But interestingly enough, I found the lunch specials are listed on the website at $7.50 and they are supposed to include a beverage. Why is it at this location (Lake Mead), the $7.50 does not include a beverage? I have always been charged for a drink. So basically, my \"discounted\" lunch special of $7.50 plus $2.25 for a drink plus tax came out to $11.08 for my lunch. Had I been able to use my $10 off card, I would've paid my remaining balance and left the cashier a nice fat tip which would've elicited a bell ringing followed by a hearty \"OPA!\" from the kitchen, as I've always done whenever I have visited. But that was not to be and at this point, it's doubtful I will ever return, at least to this location.   I must add, the quality of their food has also gone downhill. When I first started coming here, I really liked the Greek salad. But I noticed during my last couple of visits, the salad is completely bland with very few vegetables, olives, feta and the lettuce is always wilted as if it's a week old.  They're overcharging \"discounted\" specials that are supposed to include drinks, not honoring the frequent diner card and their food is mediocre fast food at best. That's a damn shame.",

    "text": "For the best experience at Market grille eat here for dinner. Lunch service is more casual and quick with customers ordering at the counter, but dinner consists of table side wait service.   Pumpkin fans have to try the pumpkin mushroom soup. Perfect for the cold weather, the smooth, creamy soup has a pronounced pumpkin flavor in this vegetable-based soup. The Greek salad that accompanied my entree was perfect for sharing. The chicken skewer entree comes with one skewer full of moist, well seasoned cubes of chicken and a veggie skewer with red and green peppers, onions, and mushrooms. The Greek trio entree was perfect for sampling the spanakopita, moussaka, and pastitsio. The spanakopita was excellent with its flaky layers of pastry covering gooey cheese and spinach. The moussaka showed some great flavors with beef, eggplant and potatoes covered in a bechamel sauce. Rice, typically an afterthought with most dishes, was buttery and soft with a lightness that is all too rare.  Dinner prices are affordable, service was friendly and efficient, and the execution of all our dishes was spot on. Market Grille may have made its way into my rotation of inexpensive dinners with one of the best Mediterranean meals I've had lately.",

We aren't eating carbs and they had no issues accommodating celery and cucumber instead of pita bread.   My husband and I both had the Greek salad with grilled chicken. The chicken was grilled perfectly and topped with a little bit of mint for nice flavor. We did say no tomatoes and ended up with tomatoes but we can pick those out easily so no problem.   Lunch service you order at the counter and dinner starts and four and is full service. Bathrooms are clean and service is pleasant. The owner served us. One thing I loved is the first time we came here it was the Durango location and the waitress introduced us to him, he gave us a coupon and invited us back. We live 30min away but if we are on this side of town and have an appetite we will surely come back again and again!",

Joe was always super friendly and made this a spot to celebrate special occasions. This is only my second time at Lake Mead restaurant. Same good food. But at this location, you have to go to a window and order and pay for your food. Your order is brought to the table when it's ready.  I think I like the table service better but I can see why it's done this way at lunch. The restaurant was super busy, everyone was friendly and the food came out hot. It was pretty noisy, a sore spot for me.  I don't know why these restaurants don't install sound deadening panels to keep it quieter.  Anyway, no fault in any of the employees. I would go there in a heartbeat, the food is fresh and healthy. The lunch specials were reasonably priced.  I especially like the pomegranate chicken, it is available several different ways.  I like this restaurant and I am picky. If the service is good and the food is hot and tasty, I like it.  I consider this a glowing review. Check it out for yourself.",

The service was great! Friendly and professional. Our server explained what some of the dishes were and also gave us recommendations. We started out with pita bread slices and a flaming cheese appetizer. Excellent! For our entrees, my husband had the pomegranate chicken and I had the traditional gyro platter. Everything was delicious but I know exactly what I'm ordering next time: Pomegranate chicken salad. OMG! That has to be the BEST chicken I've EVER had!  We ended up getting desserts to go after we got through with our meals. I ordered the pumpkin cheesecake with baklava crust and my husband got the cannoli. The cost of our meal was pretty reasonable -- less than $50 (before tip). That included two soft drinks, an appetizer (happy hour price), two entrees (salads included), and two desserts.   I'm writing this review while I'm laying in bed because the restaurant doesn't have recliners, pillows, and blankets for their customers after dinner. (Burp!!!) I'm looking forward to going back here again soon.",

I have had amazingly fantastic home made Greek food, and to be quite honest, nothing compares to that.  However, if you are looking for a sit down restaurant with very good Mediterranean food, this is the spot.    It also has a friendly neighborhood atmosphere with very nice employees.  The price is definitely fair, and as it happens if you are an LVAC member you get a 20% discount.  Which works quite well, because as I said, they have some good healthy home made style options, that are really quite fresh tasting.  Of course, just like any similar restaurant they have all of the high calorie options too, but even those taste like they use very high quality ingredients.",

Between the pasta dishes, the chicken entrees, and pizzas, and the kabobs, I could come here 3 to 4 days a week and eat different, semi healthy, and leave happy!  The first time I ever dined in, the manager noticed we had never been in before, and gave us a coupon to return. She's said hi every time since. I love the personalized service.  A couple of my personal favorites are the salmon skewers, and the mama Mia chicken. I also really enjoy the red pepper hummus.  Everything is made from scratch, in house, and they add no msg to anything! There are nightly specials for discounts on wine, which they have a pretty decent selection of. Prices and portions are on point and I've never had even close to mediocre service here. A rare Mediterranean gem, don't pass it up!",

    "text": "Oh, Market Grille. I've liked this place for a while, but a few things about the setup make it weird. As you enter, there's a nicely decorated dining room right in front of you, but huge menus to the left and a cashier. Sometimes a person will immediately ask to seat you for standard dine-in service where you pay at the end. Other times, I've gone all the way through the line, paid, then seated myself.  The temperature in here is always either too hot or abnormally cold. Last time was the latter. Caught a funky smell near the drink machines one day too, which kinda threw me.  The good part is the food. Slightly above average mediterranean with decent bang for the buck. Nice daily specials, too. I'm a fan of the chicken kotanini and pumpkin cheesecake, but opted for the chicken skewer this time. Very filling with the salad, veggies, rice, hummus, and pita.  If these guys can fine-tune the dining room experience and put a little more \"umph\" behind their \"OPA!\", they might be winning.",

We had the following:  Small plain hummus served with pita Small babaganoush with pita Side falafel Side gyro meat with pita bread Greek trio a la carte Baklava Rice pudding  The hummus was good but was surpassed by the babaganoush.  I liked the thickness of the babaganoush.  I thought the pita was mediocre.  The side of gyro meat was my other favorite of the night--not counting dessert.  There was a $.50 charge for the pita that we ordered with the meat.  The  meat was tender and flavored nicely.  The Greek trio was good with the mousaka being the stand out.  Both desserts were very good.  I liked that the baklava was not drenched in honey and nuts as many places do and the rice pudding was quite good.  Prices were good for the meal.",

The big baby and I were able to fit in a lunch hour before she left for her first business trip since her promotion.  Really... the lunch menu choices we ordered were Pomegranate chicken with pumpkin mushroom soup, and Gyro wrap with lemon chicken soup.  No joke on price and quality.  One of the best $8.50 you'll spend.  Service was super friendly and welcoming especially our first time in.  And a pleasant experience indeed for our first visit.  The manager gave us a 15% coupon for the next visit.  But Yelpers don't forget to check in since that actually gives you 20% off.  Saving mine for later ;)  Interior is really pretty - gives you the feel of being in another country.  You know I love stuff like that!  There was a mini waterfall at the beverages bar.  The floor also had grapevine decorations; and look above!  Its like an outside vineyard lounge.  Location is on Lake Mead right of the freeway.  There's ample parking considering how busy the lot appears and a variety of other services nearby in the plaza... Cupcakes a few doors down.  Good location!  Get over there already for lunchy munchies!",

Previous to dining at this location I had been to the location on Durrango where lunch was a sit down dining experience. This location does it differently with orders being placed at the counter and then brought to the table. I actually preferred this style for a weekend lunch.  I ordered a Falafel Mediterranean Wrap with Greek Salad. This was one of the lunch specials for less than $10. The wrap was large enough to take half home. The falafel was yummy and I loved the taste of all of the wrap ingredients together. The side salad was also a nice size and I liked their Greek dressing.  The food didn't take long to arrive and the staff continued to check on us and cleared plates. I was also offered a takeout box for my leftovers without having to ask for one.",

Wow! FANTASTIC is the only word that comes to mind.  As stated in my tip, to start with the aesthetics, it's a beautiful setting to dine in; ambiance is on point.  Then, the Yelp recommendations never fail me. The food reviews were great. I went with the traditional Gyro. I can only recall having one once or maybe twice in my life, so this was a adventurous choice. The breading wrap was like being forced to eat the best pillow you've ever slept on. Then you get to the ingredients on the inside - meat, salad, yogurt-dill sauce - magical! The amount, textures, flavor was perfect.  The second order was Pomagranate Chicken which was soooo unexpected, and Greek salad. This chicken was amazing! 6-8 slices of perfectly moist, perfectly tender meat that seemed to be flavored with the perfect hint of Pomagranate, as if the Pomagranate Chicken was a divinely created animal by God \"on the 5th day.\" Can anyone disprove that the Pomagranate Chicken hasn't always been around!?   I have never had anything like these dishes. But for this experience, I would regularly pass over Greek food lacking interest. This experience makes me look out for Greek food like I need my next fix. Thank you, LV!",

But this place feels like more of a restaurant. and I wanna peruse a menu Darn it!  However The food is really good so I can put my own weird preferences aside.   I've had their moussaka, seasoned fries, hummus plate and creamy cilantro soup and Ive loved all of it. I can't wait to go back and try more dishes.   The atmosphere is great, the colors and music, and light, the open style kitchen so you can see the cooks at work. Its awesome.   The best part is leaving a tip, everyone has to yell OPA!",

The gyro pizza was very unexpected when received. They're small pizzas with a chock full of sausage and weird things I could not contemplate. I will revise this review as soon as I get back and I'm less in a rush of things. Thus far, this place is fantastic considering the quality and price.",

But kinda cool because they remembered what I ordered the previous day.    I always get the first soup they have on the menu, I can't remember the name of it but it's the one with the rice in it!  I've tried numerous entree's too but always end up with the pomegranate chicken as the most flavorful.  The baklahva tastes the way it should, so much sugar and butter.  And I always love the hummus!    This place is clean, the hostesses are nice and hardworking.  When you walk in you'll be surprised at their giant menu and visual menu on the tv screens!

This past time I tried the chicken skewers which comes alone with rice or for a fee, as a platter with Greek salad and hummus with pita tips. The chicken was delicious and nicely seasoned and I liked that it came with grilled vegetables and even a few tiny grilled peaches. I also really liked the salad which was crunchy and tangy.",

The stuffed peppers didn't look too nice, but we did get it to-go. Didn't taste too bad, and the bed of rice it came with was pretty good. Came with a small salad as well that had a tasty balsamic vinaigrette. Downside is the side of dressing was in a thimble-sized cup. I didn't know they made sauce cups that small. The chicken was interesting. At first it tasted like Chinese BBQ, but then an overly sweet taste kicked in. Still not sure how much I liked it. It WAS different. Should have just got a gyro(jirow.

I found this place to be as described (Greek), which is not always the case for Mediterranean restaurants. I got their gyro. Very good. My girlfriend got the Spanankopita, which she loved. She tried their pumpkin soup, and loved that as well.  Their hummus tends to the garlicky side, which I like. I was not too impressed with the flavor and texture of the pita wedges that come with the hummus. I prefer the bread to be in larger pieces and less grilled.  I'm not too sure about the tv screens showing pictures of food. That seemed a little weird to me.  Overall a good experience, and we want to return when we are on that side of town again.",

We ordered the Mousaka, the Herb Roasted Chicken and the Saganaki appetizer. This restaurant is semi-fast food style and very casual.  You order and pay at the counter and they bring you your food. The saganaki (fire fried cheese) was too wet and not fire burnt.  The fire woudln't light. It seems the way they prepare it here (their other restaurant has been around for about for a few years) seems to be different from all other greek restaurants. My chicken tasted fine, but was too dry. My wife's Mousaka was ok-but not as good as she has had elsewhere.  She has been eating at Greek restaurants for years.  I think the real test is \"will we be back?\".  Maybe-but we will wait for them to work the 'bugs' out. I feel new businesses should always be given some slack. I would give them 2.5 if I could.

The atmosphere reminded me of my own mother's house! Clean and nicely decorated.  We went around 7pm so it was semi quiet. We ordered at the counter, which is fine with me. The Menus are right there on the wall for you with colorful pictures of the food displayed above. We decided to share and ordered two soups, the gyro stew and lentil soup with 1 lamb and 1 chicken Souvlaki (skewers) platters. We got our drinks and headed for a booth. The soup came to the table almost immediately and both were hot and delicious. Within 6-8 min after that, the Souvlaki's arrived. They came with grilled veggies and the meat was hot and so tender....yum!!! Platters come with rice, chopped greek salad, a side of hummus and soft pita bread. We were asked at least 4 times how we were doing. It may sound like overkill, but you never know when you might need something and they seem to try to keep you seated so your not having to wonder around and keep you happy enough that you aren't waving someone down. All you have to do for yourself is get your drink! We also decided that we were just a tad bit still hungry and ordered the kalamata and cheese. It was all so perfect!!! Very pleased. I, then, went for lunch with my brother and mother. Let the shinanagins begin. My family is pretty particular. We got in and I proceed to direct them through the menu and made suggestions and took charge of ordering (it's better that way! Trust me!) We got the falafal gyro, the traditional gyro (lamb/beef combo meat) platters and a greek salad with chicken. We sat down and in about 5 minutes our food came out. DELICIOUS!!! Our only complaint was that we aren't 'chopped salad' fans. Funny how I only notice this with my family!!! My brother quickly returned his salad and, almost as quick, got a chicken gyro. DELICIOUS!!! Great prices, fast, great service, great food, and clean!!! What more could ask for??? OPA!",

I ordered the filet skewer, which was about 12 dollars, and a drink, and the total came to about 15 bucks.  I also asked if I can have the yogurt sauce, thinking it would come with the food, as it's a Greek place and all.  I guess I was wrong, since they charged me fifty cents for it.  The food was delivered to my table fairly quickly, by a charming young man who definitely improves the experience here.  Anyhow, I took a bite of my potatoes and immediately, my face turned blue.  The flavoring was so off, and salty and sour, I was sure the potatoes were stuffed with sour patch kids.  So I shifted my attention to the beef that was on my plate, and it too was again, too salty and sour.  C'mon guys, lemons are pricey these days, quit squeezing five lemons on top of every plate!  I'll stop here while I'm still ahead (alive), because honestly, the owner looked pretty buff and scary.  Enjoy",

I have tried it both on the salad (yummy!) and the platter which comes with basmati rice, side salad and hummus with pita. I loved it both ways. My friends ordered the chicken and lamb gyros which they reported to be average.  The pumpkin baklava cheesecake is to die for!  Its unique and absolutely wonderful!",

    "text": "I ended up eating at this place by chance.  It happened to be located in the same small plaza as a couple of my other favorite eateries: Panera and Chipotle.  I pulled into the parking lot with the intention of eating at Panera, but because of the small concentration of popular establishments, there was no parking available directly in front of Panera.  So I found myself parked in front of a place called the Market Grille Cafe, advertising Greek and Mediterranean food.  Mmmm, I thought, that sounds good.  And in I went.  It's a similar style eatery as Panera.  You order and pay at the counter, and then you take a number and find your own table and sit down to wait for someone to bring you the food.  I liked the fact that Greek music was playing over the speakers.  It provided an authentic feel.  If I had not been determined to stick to my vegetarian and fish diet, I would have ordered the herb roasted chicken and potatoes, because that sounds truly awesome, but instead I ordered a veg-a-nini ($6.95) and a small village greek salad ($5.95). The veg-a-nini was served and cut like a miniature pizza on pita bread.  The toppings included spinach-basil pesto, chopped kalamata olives, grilled red onions, and crumbled feta cheese.  It was light and flavorful.  The only difference between the regular greek salad and the village greek salad is that the village greek salad contains no romaine lettuce.  I have nothing against romaine lettuce (in fact, I love it), but authentic greek salads don't contain any lettuce, and I thought this would be a rare opportunity to enjoy an authentic greek salad.  Alas, while the ingredients were authentic, the cucumber and tomatoes were served diced rather than sliced and in wedges.  The feta was also crumbled rather than served in chunks or in a large slice atop the salad.  Unfortunately, the way the ingredients are prepared and served changes the experience of the flavors and taste of the dish.  It still tasted good, but not as delicious as an authentic presentation would have been.  If I had known that the tomatoes and cucumber would be diced, I would have ordered the regular greek salad with the romaine lettuce for the same price, although I fear the romaine lettuce might be served shredded.  Before I left, I ordered baklava to go.  A generous portion of this sweet nutty dessert is $4.75.  I enjoyed it.  Based on the overall menu and my expectations, I really wanted to give this place four stars.  Based on my experience, I can only give it three.",

The servers were all very helpful and nice.  We found no problem with the prices and with the discount for gym members, you can pay for your gym membership with the money you can save if you eat there a few times a month.  Wine price was very reasonable and the decor was simple but warm and friendly.  We had a very good first time experience and will be back again.",

It's been awhile since I've visited Market Grille. I was so excited today because I was on the west side (since moving to Henderson in 2010) and I could go to Market Grille. I've always enjoyed their food. However, they have apparently gotten too big for their britches. I received 1 skewer of dime sized chunks of lamb and 1 skewer of tomatoes and onions. For the $13.00 price tag I usually get at least double the meat at my favorite Greek spot in Henderson (Greek Bistro) and it tastes just as good if not better. The service there is better as well, as I see the owner and her children every time I go there and not some random \"doesn't care\" cashier. Market Grille, in my opinion, has fallen off from what they used to be. Give your customers what they pay for. Good food, good portions, and Great service. The food was great but you fouled the bed in the other two departments.",

They regularly offer a 15% OFF coupon in the local VIEW newspaper, so keep an eye out.  i like that they have vegetarian and gluten free options.  This allows my entire family the chance to all agree on one place to eat out.  I like their hummus. Their falafel is/are excellent. Their lemon rice soup is very good, and so are their Greek fries.  Their Veginini is just OK, not quite worth what they're charging for it.    Their traditional gyro is very interesting.  Their sauce is made with dill, not cucumber.  That's good, because I HATE cucumber.  But I love gyros so much, I will tolerate it in the gyro sauce.  Don't have to worry about that here.  Only problem with their gyro is that the meat is always very dry.  The only thing I can figure is that not enough people order the gyro, so the meat dries out on the rotisserie, maybe?  But hey, slather enough sauce on it, and everything's OK.  :)  They keep the place clean.  The staff are friendly (and busy!).  The line moves well, and the wait for your food is short.  It's sometimes tough to find a parking spot during lunch time, but that's due to a few other restaurants being in the same shopping center.",

The Spanikopita is one of the best I've had, and the rice and hummus that accompany most dishes are delicious! If you order the entree, there is easily enough food to make a second meal out of leftovers! The decor/atmosphere is fun and relaxing - a great venue for family meals or casual lunch with friends.

The two girls working there were very helpful giving me suggestions of the different vegan options they have. I love how knowledgable they are with my special diet. For instance, they pointed out that their dolmades is actually cooked (the rice) with chicken broth. They also pointed out that their babaganoush and hummus had some dairy in it (which was disappointing since I love those dishes). I ended up ordering their tabouli and falafel. My friend ordered some babaganoush, hummus, dolmades and greek salad. The falafel was overwhelmingly flavorful (too much spices) and was too salty for both of our palates. The rest of the appetizers were just okay. My rating is mostly based on the service, cleanliness and location of the restaurant. Some of the dishes might be better so I'll give it another chance.",

You walk in and then order at the counter then go take a seat and when is ready they bring it to you.   The atmosphere is very welcoming. The service was pretty good too. Traditional, delicious Mediterranean fares to be found here. Great for meat and non-meat eaters alike. But be sute tocheck out that dessert menu!",

    "text": "I loved this place , especially my mom she was so giddy about the food and the atmosphere. We got the veggie gyro, with the platter of pita, rice, a salad. I feel the salad should be the whole spot light of the meal , because the dressing was more than to die for ! Best dressing ive ever had, the salad was so fresh and was gone in about 2 minutes. The gyro was splendid,  with the yogurt sauce, the rice was delicious. The pita itself was soft and still warm, but I didn't like the hummus at all .. it needed a little something to amp it up . But I did love the vanilla chai tea wowza, super good !I will be coming back very soon , loved the service.. The nice guy helped explain the menu, and once you order a joyous \"opa\" came from all the workers. After 4 , they serve you at your table .. There was beautiful hand painted artwork on the walls , and light and garland hung on the ceiling.",

    "text": "Always in the fight, but never a champion.  The Market Grill has a ton of good/safe options.  I come here regularly for lunch, and there are so many items that I can order and be content with.  The problem is that I never say to myself, \"Man, I'm really in the mood for _______ from Market Grill.\"   They will do in a pinch...and then some.  Plus, they often have a solid Yelp Check-in Offer or some other program going on.  I avoid the hummus here, but regularly take part in Gyros, Salads, Wraps, and Combo Plates.  I would give out 3 or 3.5 stars just on the food.  The service is always on though, they are accommodating here, and it is always clean...even during the lunch rush...so I settle at 4 stars.  Not authentic Greek or Mediterranean.  Certainly not my favorite for either, but one I frequent because it's convenient, I know what I'll get, and I appreciate friendly service.",

Luckily today I remedied that problem.   The cafe itself is so cutely decorated and homey feeling. The menu is quite diverse and seems to have everything I have ever heard of in Greek food. I had a traditional gyro and was quite pleased. You can ask for the yogurt and hummus on the side, so you can try both options. Both are yummy and I don't think I could decide which was better, so the option to get both is great!  My daughter got the cheesy pita and ate almost the whole thing. This is a big deal because she usually eats one bite and is done. So I think that is another point for this place.   I also felt very welcomed here as well. The staff is friendly and helpful. The manager stopped by my table several times to check on us, as well as chat a bit. It really feels like a neighborhood joint. I like this place! Go check it out when you have a minute.",

My friend and her mom who treated me to dinner have visited many many times though so I trusted their expertise in navigating the menu, which offered a lot of options. This visit, we all got gyros. I went the classic route and got gyro meat filling in mine  First off, that thing was massive. A chore to finish on its own and I can't imagine myself attempting it as a platter with all the sides. Soft warm pita with tons of fresh veggies and stuffed with a pile of gyro meat. Everything about this gyro was great except the meat, which was a bummer. Weird spongy texture, dry and flavorless. I can still recommend trying the gyros here, just not with this kinda mystery meat  Portion sizes are huge for the price and the HH prices are great. The restaurant is clean and although the decor seems outdated, it provides an endearing cozy feel. Service was pretty good too, although the servers seemed to be operating on autopilot. I feel that all these factors are worthy of bumping my rating up despite the questionable meat. I'll be back to try the pomegranate chicken coworkers who've worked here rave about and hopefully up this rating",

This would be super helpful for how popular it is now a days for people to see what kind of calories/macros they're taking in!",

    "text": "Solid lunch spot for me. They have lunch specials like wraps, gyros, and salads that come with a drink. The meals are really quite large and I usually have to get a box to go even at lunch. I've had the chicken wrap but recently tried the falafel gyro and it was awesome. The falafel was really soft on the inside and you can actually mash it up and spread it out so you don't have to bite into a giant ball every 4 bites. The service is always good, they typically have a manager that walks around and hands out silverware and asks if you need anything. You order at the counter and wait for it to be delivered to your table so you can get in and out quickly during lunch. Definitely recommend for a fast casual Greek meal.",

    "text": "I can't believe I lived near this Market Grille for 4 years and never stopped in for a bite until 3 years after I moved to the other side of the valley. Shame on me. But I did make it in the other day when a group of us from the office made the drive up the 95 for lunch. I must say I was impressed. The restaurant is small like a cafe as the name would suggest. But it is decorated well. It feels almost like somebody's backyard garden. The Greek music playing adds to the atmosphere.  For my lunch I ordered a traditional gyro with a Greek salad. The gyro was stuffed full of meat, lettuce, tomato, cucumber and onion all topped with a yogurt dill sauce. It was delicious and filling. All the stuff that fell out mixed well with the salad which had much of the same stuff. But it also had fetta cheese and olives. I can't not love that. It was a good solid meal. And the price was fair given the portions. No complaints in that department. I can't really complain about much of anything honestly. Sevice was good too. Friendly and quick the way it should be. It bothers me to pay for a bottle of water when most places have free water cups but whatever. I'm not going to hate on them over that.  I hope I get the chance to come back again in the future. Maybe on my own without the coworkers. A booth gets awful crowded with 4 fat a$$ dudes crammed in it. I'd be more comfortable dining solo.",

I got a gyro salad, which came with more of an Italian vinaigrette than a Greek dressing, the gyro meat was ok but I've definitely had better. The tzatziki and pita were weird. I can't explain why, but it wasn't very good. The second star is for the friendliness of the staff and the super quick service (probably because there were only 2 or 3 tables sat).",

We also add a side order of gyro meat to share on the side. The gyros are also really good as well as the Plato's potato's (their fries). The staff is always super friendly and the food always comes out fast and fresh. I recommend this place to people all the time.

I say that because I want to go to Greece one day and after I've had the real cuisine, I will be able to determine what's the True flavors of the country.   My favorite here is always the Traditional gyro or platter. I like that they have a lunch special which includes a gyro or wrap and your choice of filling, traditional , chicken, falafel or veggie. choice of salad, fries or basmati rice, and a drink all for $9.95  I've been here for dinner and had the trio with the Moussaka, Pastitsio, and spanakopita, the servings were smaller than I expected, as I was sharing this meal between the 3 of us so that we could have a taste and that's basically what we had  each was a bite. Although we did order a greek salad and an appetizer of hummus and pita.   The aphrodite's  cheesecake was good. Basically we were watching the video on the screen which showed how they were making it and on the recommendation of the worker we ordered it. It was very interesting to have the baklava crust. I would get it again if I have  any room that is.   staff is always friendly here, you get greeted when you arrive and when you leave and they shout \"Opa!\" when the food order is up.",

Third time trying it because I figured I would give it another chance since my first and second time was at the one in centennial and it sucked 4 years ago. This one is about the same and the food is mediocre.   Why do you ask?  ..Well, let's start with the Greek salad. The dressing is horrible. Almost like they put paprika or cinnamon in it. Just god awful and should never be labeled a \"Greek\" salad when the dressing tastes nothing like it. It's not authentic. It's gross, and they need to change it. In addition, the feta is salty and dry along with the under-ripe tomatoes. Olives were fine!   My advice: Change your dressing. Keep it simple with authentic Greek spice. If you're a True Greek, you will know what this means. Also, even the side Greek should come with pita bread. Coney islands do. Every salad comes with a pita. No exceptions!   The gyro meat was dry and very thin. I will say it was neartly sliced which made an attractive sandwich. Authentic gyro meat is nice and juicy! Not dry.   My advice: Throw some fries in the gyro. Make it authentic like they do in Greece, if you want a Greek presentation.",

It's dinner time and we're all very hungry. I order the Lamb Roast Cabernet, slow-roasted leg of lamb, complemented with a Cabernet reduction mushroom au jus sauce with a side of lemon herb roasted potatoes instead of rice; available upon request. My daughter ordered the Greek Trio, \"a selection of (their) most popular spanakopita, mousaka, and pastitsio\"; and my wife ordered Lamb Souvlaki, skewered cubes of lamb meat with rice. The bill came out to  $46 without the tip. So far so good? Yes, the service was very good. Malaysia our waitress was attentive, personal and knowledgeable about the menu. Gere is where the roller coaster ride begins its steep descent. The potatoes, skewered lamb and side dill dipping sauce were all terribly bland. The mousaka was fried and overcooked on the bottom, and not even a knife would cut through it. Too bad the kitchen doesn't rate as highly as its service, which in my experience is rare. My advice to management is that it's Greek food, so take some risks and spice it up a little. By the way, salt is not a spice. I'll may eat here again. I'd like to see if they change things up.

    "text": "This Mediterranean restaurant has great food. I especially love their homemade soups!  The downside:  There is no table service (i.e., no wait staff). You order and pay with the cashier, take a number, and wait for your food to be brought to you by a food runner. You also help yourself to the beverages at the beverage station. Some people may not mind that there isn't table service. For me, it just feels a little like I should be in a fast food restaurant.  The cost is not proportionate for the size of the food order. Quality is not an issue. The food tastes great. I had a small bowl of homemade Pumpkin Mushroom soup for $6.00. The soup was fantastic - all 5-6 spoonfuls of it! He had a small Pomegranate Chicken Spinach Salad for $10.50 that is served on a small 7\" plate. The salad was a very good, high priced appetizer. I had the Lamb Roast Cabernet, which was heavenly for $13.00. He had the Lamb Souvlaki, which is a grilled lamb skewer for $12.00. It does not come with enough lamb to be worthy of the price. Entree's come with a miniature greek salad, rice, hummus & pita bread.  The ultimate self-serve fountain station costs $3.00 per person. The ambiance is nice - no complaints there.",

I also ordered the spanakopita which I would pass on. Honestly go to Smiths frozen food section and you will find some tastier ones. I'm not a fan of the set up. You have to order and pay first (Carl's Jr. Style). The problem with this is that you may under order. I wanted to try dessert after my meal but I didn't want to go through the line and use my debit card again. I don't like to order my dessert before I have my meal because I'm not sure how I will feel after. I think it would be nicer as a sit down restaurant.",

I was really surprised by the lack of options for a place that advertises gluten free and veg options. It would have been nice for them to mark every menu item being GF and/or veg, but instead I had to cross compare them on the different sections. I was pretty disappointed that the hummus, falafal and baba ganoush weren't vegan (and so was my vegan kid who really wanted some hummus).   I ended up getting veggie skewers in a meal served over rice and with a Greek salad, hummus, and cucumber slices. The veggies were really great, actually, but the portions were pretty small for the price.  The restaurant itself was clean, nicely decorated, and great artwork on the walls. It's a bit out of the way while driving through Vegas, but still conviently off the 95. There are so many places to eat in Vegas that we'll probably not go out of our way to eat there again, but I would consider it if we are in the area.",

I had the pomegranate chicken entree, and my husband had the lamb. Everything was absolutely delicious from our Greek salads, to our entrees, and to our dessert! We shared a slice of Aphrodite's cheesecake and it was a great size for two, especially after inhaling our dinner! Next time I want my own slice though because it was seriously that delicious! They also have a tiramisu cheesecake I want to try on our next visit, which will be in the near future!!!! Thank you so much for the amazing food and fantastic service!!!

They were open later than similar options in the area, so that influenced my pick as well.   The setup was a little confusing at first glance, but we were able to figure it out. You can be seated or place a to go order. We were promptly seated and given a warm welcome. The menu has a variety of options. We decided to stick to the classics and ordered doulmades for our appetizer and gyros. The food was delicious and the doulmades were quite thick. We followed up our meal with a dessert gyro, which contained marscapone, toffee bits, chocolate sauce, and sliced strawberries. It was housed in a pita dusted with cinnamon sugar. Never had anything like it, that's for sure. It was amazing!  I especially loved the hospitality of the staff. Jessica was particularly lovely and made sure we were happy throughout the meal.   I would love to dine there again and try some more things. Highly recommended.",

I went during lunch so no table service, which was cool because i enjoy eating my food and not talking to waiters who know damn well i need more water. Now about that food... ya boy got four total kabobs. Two steak, one vegetable, and a chicken with a side of pita & hummus. The vegetables were crisp, the chicken was JUUicy with two U's. Now this steak, shyyyyt man. Prob the best steak I've had from a Mediterranean place. Cooked and flavored perfectly, had me like \"oo oo oo oo, yummy in my tummy\". The rice was cool I guess, but who's honestly going out for food on the sole condition the rice is good?   The actual establishment is fairly small, open seating with maybe 4 or so booths. Again i went after the lunch rush so it was quiet, and somewhat empty. Fountain Drink selection is standard coke products, and what one would call \"freshly brewed\"  Reasons i didn't rate 5 stars.  * I had to eat my rice with a fork.   * Not only did 90% of the rice fall off the fork before my mouth, what rice made it into my mouth was lukewarm. Possibly the constant falling motion from fork to plate super cooled the rice?   * The bread is whatever, it's not bad, it's not good. It's just there  Anyways, it's a cool spot. I'll be eating here again.  (Excuse any grammar/spelling errors, I'm multitasking)",

I decided to grab dinner tonight so he could try it and was extremely disappointed. My chicken skewer was dry and burnt, leaving a terrible after taste. His steak skewer was also overcooked and lacked flavor. He actually asked if it was supposed to come with a dipping sauce because it was so dry. The veggie skewers and salad were however tasty. Ultimately I ended up throwing out an entire chicken skewer (I ordered an extra one) and giving my dogs the remainder of mine. My husband's meal is sitting on the counter and we are headed out to grab a burger. Disappointed I wasted $35.",

    "text": "After trying the Durango location I saw that this location was actually closer to my house and figured I would try it. First and foremost: if you check in then you get 10% off. Make sure you do it upon arrival.   This isn't a regular restaurant set up like the other location like I was expecting. You actually go up to the front and order then pay up front.  They have you take a little number thing to a table and wait or you can order to go. I was brought my food and then never had anyone check on me again, which isn't a huge deal since the drinks are also self serve. However, while I was waiting for my food one of the owners (she said her family owned the 2 restaurants) walked up to the table next to me, asked how their food was and had a whole convo then gave them a 15% off coupon for next time. She proceeded to not say a word to me. She then was the one who brought me my food and still didn't speak to me other than to confirm it was for me. I normally wouldn't complain but if you are going to treat the customer 1 foot away from me a certain way and give them special treatment then I expect the same since I heard the entire thing and watched it happen.   As for the food, I ordered the lamb souvlaki entree. My lamb was kind of dry but the overall flavor wasn't bad. The veggie skewer was flavored well and I liked the dipping sauce provided. Rice was a tad bland but nothing a little salt and hot sauce couldn't solve. My salad was good but I would've liked just a bit more dressing on it because a few of bites I took tasted as if they had none. Overall it was all okay, but I will definitely stick to the other location on Durango because I had a far superior experience there the times I have went.",

I had the pomegranate chicken lunch special with fries for $10. The chicken was super delicious and not dry at all. It had a nice smoky flavor. Our server was super nice and attentive. The only downside is the price. There are plenty of fast food restaurants nearby, so I wouldn't necessarily eat here on a regular basis.",

They give you tons of flavorful meat in the gyros and I can drink the yogurt sauce by itself.  I love their Greek salad, so fresh and the dressing is amazing.  Their rice is fluffy and love the mint they put in it.  The hummus is ok. We always get an extra order of pita bread for $0.50.  Normally my husband and I would order different dishes and share when we order from restaurants but their beef and lamb gyro is so good , we have decided to get our own.  Overall, great value for the amount of quality food that we get.  Also, the staff are really great.  We have eaten at the restaurant before but order to go most of the time.",

The presentation was exactly the same but this time, it tasted great! The pastry was flaky and it had the right amount of saltiness. It looked kind of like a spinach lasagna. It was over a bed of rice pilaf. I did not care for the rice, it was lacking flavor and moisture. I also ordered their pumpkin cheesecake. Way too sweet. Even sweeter than the ones I order at the Cheesecake Factory. I would say 3.5 stars this time around.",

I rarely get chicken breast anything because it's usually so dry and blah at places. It's juicy and lightly done up with a slightly sweet sauce.   I'm surprised this location doesnt get as good reviews as Centennial on the food consistency. So far, we havent had anything off yet, but we normally don't go to this one.  We like how this one has booths which are more comfy than the small setup in the Centennial location.   Is it the most authentic food around? Well, no....it's kinda light on the spices that generally I come to expect  distinctively present in Mediterranean fare. It's good food- just not what I come to associate when I want Greek home cooking but what I associate with light and fresh choices if that makes sense.",

I learned that this place is a family owned and family run restauarnt and you can tell by the quailty of the food and the great service you get when you come. All the flavors are really fresh and flavorful. Some things I recommend:  Saganaki: it's literally flamming cheese! They bring it out on an iron skillet and light in on fire table side. Awesome presentation and even more awesome flavors. You eat the cheese with toasted pita bread and it was so delicious!! It's a great appetizer.   Pomegrante Chicken: I love it in the Gyros because I can eat it like a sandwich or over-sized taco. The chicken was very juicy and fresh. I couldn't taste the pomegrante flavor very much, but the dill dressing gave it a nice touch.   Pumpkin Baklava Cheesecake: can I say AMAZING!?!? If you love cheesecake and if you love anything Pumpkin, this is the perfect dessert for you! The crust is a baklava crust, which basically means it's flakey like a pie crust instead of crumbly like a normal cheesecake crust. So good!  Overall, this was a very nice, fresh, and overall very guilt-free meal. Everything was just so healthy (with an exception of the cheesecake) that I wouldn't feel guilty eating here multiple times a week!",

    "text": "Market Grill is like an Outkast song: so fresh and so clean. However, don't expect them to actually be bumpin' Big Boi and Dre on their subs. First, I don't think they have subs, and second, their speakers are reserved for Greek tunes. The opa tunes add to a festive, comfortable, complete atmosphere. By complete, I mean that every little detail here is oozing Greekness. From the moment you walk in, you know that the owner takes their business seriously. I like it.  Before placing your order at the counter, you can peruse the giant menus. On these super-sized menus I discovered one of my all time favorite things to order at a Mediterranean restaurant: a combination platter! Yes, I know: very authentic. It is prefect for indecisive me, as I don't know whether I want hummus, falafel, tabouleh, baba ganoush, dolmades, or a Greek salad. Well, I do know, that I don't want dolmades, but the nice lady let me get more falafel instead. At $10 and change, it was less expensive than the other place in town where I had seen a similar offering, so I decided to go for it!  Everything was fresh, and I really enjoyed the baba ganoush and hearty lentil soup (not part of combo platter, but part of husband's order). The pita was warm and soft. The other items were good, but not amazing. The falafel were a bit salty, but tasty. However, they were odd. They seemed almost as if they had been baked, not fried, and they were a little small. I enjoyed the flavor, but not necessarily the texture.  Little bonus items include filtered water, clearly marked Gluten-free and vegetarian options, and a frequent diner card. Get punches for each $10 you spend, and after 10 punches, get $10 off.   All in all I think the complete package is a keeper. I might not rush back for falafel, but it is the kind of place I would be happy to take my Southern mom to order some flaming cheese.",

    "text": "This establishment took the property in the Lake Mead Plaza that used to be Pei Wei.  They kept the skeleton of the previous restaurant and almost like waving a magic wand, made everything that was formerly Asian... the menu, decor, font... and made it Greek.    Friendly staff.  Clean Bathrooms.  Good food.  Reasonable prices.  The owner is friendly and approachable.  The format: Head in, choose off the menu, order, get your number, grab your drink, display the number, and your food arrives shortly.    Make sure you give them a heads up if you'd like your appetizer prior to your main entree as it sometimes arrives all at once.  When I visit, I usually drop in and have a Gyro around lunchtime... traditional, with hummus served on it.  Veggies are fresh, the meat slices are nice and hot.  For dinner I enjoy the Greek Trio Platter.  I enjoy the Greek dinner dishes with pasta and the like but sometimes it can be a lot of one flavor.  The Greek Trio platter is a sample of three of their main dishes with a bit of salad.  I also recommend the pomegranate chicken salad, my roommate's favorite on the menu.  The saganaki is pretty good, too.  It's not the best I've had, but it's not drowning in oil or greasy.  Love to eat it drenched on pitas.  The stuffed grape leaves and the pumpkin soup are also notable as delicious appetizers that I consistently enjoy.  I'm honestly not a huge fan of their hummus.  I think it could do with a pinch more flavoring and it's a little too smooth for me.  It works well as a complimentary taste on the pita but solo, not so much.  I recognize a few of the songs that they play in the background from My Big Fat Greek Wedding.  See if you notice which ones!  :)",

Food tastes much better when the restaurant isn't packed, maybe because they're in a rush, on the plus side, if you're a LVAC member, you get a discount when you show them your card, if you're ever in the neighborhood, give them a try, you won't be disappointed!",

Prices are reasonable and  yelper's often get a coupon (i.e., good deal!) upon checking in (the last coupon I used was for 20% off the bill).  Service is also quick, for lunch you order from the counter and for dinner they have sit-down service.",

You also have options for your pita bread of wheat and some other options. The Lamb and beef were fresh, the dill sauce was refreshing and wasn't overpowering. And they packed in the meat. The hummus was great and on par with other establishments.  A little weird that you order then they bring it to you. Would be better if you ordered at your table. Ohhh the desserts. I went with Aphrodite's cheesecake. It was huge with a baklava crust. Damn a great combination and delicious.",

Chicken skewers can be quite dry, so I would opt for the roasted chicken entree or the pomegranate chicken.   Seems that a lot of people on here are complaining about the sauces. Every Mediterranean restaurant has their own style, so if you are expecting humus like you buy in the store, then don't. Yes, their humus is a bit less thick than what most are used to, and their satziki sauce has a lot of garlic. But everything is homemade! Try telling your mom to modify her family recipe to match a store brand. Psh!  One of the staff forgot to include part of my order when I came to collect it, but they redeemed themselves by being overly apologetic and giving me a box of free cookies. Also, they have a rewards card as well. I'm a fan of any place that does this!",

    "text": "Ordering process: take a gander at their (bright and blinding) back-lit LED menus lined up in the entry-way, order your food at the counter, pay, they hand you a table number, take a seat, enjoy the smoke show (there was a cloud of smoke surrounding the restaurant, coming from the open kitchen - so much smoke! we felt like we were inside of a haunted mansion lol), they bring the food to your table.   After much consideration, my boyfriend and I chose the Gyros, which have: lettuce, chopped red onions, tomatoes, cucumber, feta stuffed into a warm pita bread and topped with the choice of yogurt dill sauce or hummus.  My boyfriend went with the Traditional (beef/lamb) beef gyro (with yogurt dill sauce) $7.75 - The meat was more-so on the salty side, but the yogurt dill sauce helped cut the saltiness nicely. The size of this gyro was huge - there was more than enough food for him to become full and satisfied.   I went with the Pomegranate chicken gyro (with yogurt dill sauce) $7.95 - The Pomegranate chicken had a pleasant, slight sweetness to it, but I could barely taste or make out any distinct \"pomegranate\" flavor. It was also charred black on some pieces, overcooked, tough and dry. This gyro was also a generous size - definitely big enough to stuff me silly. Although it was dry, I would most likely dabble in this gyro again.  For an additional $3.50, I turned my Gyro into a \"Gyro Platter\" which came with:  - Greek salad - the zesty dressing was very vinegary and they barely gave any feta cheese. Also, the olives tasted great, but they only give you 3 tiny baby olives.  - Basmati herb rice - the rice was very salty and the grains were extremely dried out.  - Hummus & pita - the ratio of hummus to pita was un-proportional. The hummus wasn't bad, but they only gave us the tiniest container of it - it's not even substantial enough to comment on. The pita was cut up into 4 tiny points and tasted average.   For a total of $11+ to turn the gyro into a platter, it wasn't worth it - the extras were not memorable. Just get the gyro, it's more than enough food to get filled up with.   The yogurt dill sauce is what made the gyros enjoyable. It was refreshing and creamy. Whatever you do, get that sauce and drench the dry pomegranate chicken or the salty gyro meat in it - you will love it!",

They have 2 locations, one on Lake Mead and one in Centennial I believe, but the the Lake Mead location is more convienant for us.  The place seems more family oriented, with a very friendly staff coming by to chat and make sure everything is perfect. Upon arriving we were greeted immediately. For lunch you need to order at the register and it's seat yourself. I believe the first time I went was for lunch and I was seated immediately and handed a menu. A server came over and took our orders then. Anyways, besides the point.  I ordered the traditional gyro platter with the dill yogurt sauce. The platter came with a Greek salad, pita bread, hummus and rice. More than enough for me!  My boyfriend ordered the lamb kabob platter, which came with a Greek salad, pita bread, and rice. The salads came out almost immediately. They were your typical Greek salads. A salad is a salad to me.  I love a good gyro and I enjoyed this just as much as any other. They packed in a good amount of meat, which I pulled out maybe half and ate later with the rice & pita bread. The dill yogurt sauce was very subtle, not too sour or overpowering.  My boyfriend enjoyed his lamb kabobs, found them to be very tender and a good amount of food for him.  At the end of the meal our server came over to make sure everything was to our liking and boxed up my leftover and we were on our way. Unfortunately, we left no room for dessert but the baklava with added ice cream and the tiramisu had caught our eye. I guess we will save that for next time. All in all it was fast and an enjoyable lunch for us!",

    "text": "I frequently think about this place when I go next door to Viet Bistro. I just never had the courage to go in and try the food. I'm not too big on Greek foods. I've ate it couple times but always had an experienced person with me to help me order.   After the gym one of my friends said this place was really good so we decided to eat here.   You order your food and then you sit down and they'll bring your food to you. I decided on the lunch special (around $8). There's a list of food you can choose from for the lunch special. I got a chicken gyro with avgolemono soup. It doesn't come with a drink so you have to order that separately.   Chicken gyro- chicken was kind of dry. The yogurt sauce that go with the gyro is usually my favorite part. But their yogurt sauce was a bit on the sour side so it wasn't the taste I was used to. The portion is pretty big though.   Avgolemono soup- it's a creamy lemon soup with chicken and rice. Oh I did not like that at all! It was way too sour for me.  The food didn't take too long but it didn't come out quick either. The workers were nice and helpful. I don't want to cross this place off my list just yet but I probably won't be returning any time soon.",

    "text": "I was on a mission to deliver some food for a starving friend and a quick search on Yelp led me here. Overall very pleased with the service and food!  Market Grille Cafe is located in a plaza on Rockspring Rd. and can easily be found with their humongous signage. Dine-in, take-out and catering available.   I ordered based on my friendly server's suggestion and got their Traditional Gyro (beef and lamb). Also picked up a soup since my starving friend is a huge soup connoisseur.    Their traditional gyro comes in 7-inch pita bread and is packed with loads of beef and lamb. They offer a choice of hummus or yogurt dill sauce but my server was kind enough to include both sauce on the side. Gyro itself is a big portion but this can also be made in a combo platter which comes with Greek salad, basmati rice, pita bread and hummus for additional charge of $4. Meaty, filling, and packed with flavor. Highly recommend.   The soup I picked up is called Avgolemono and is also known as lemon, chicken and rice soup. This soup is similar to porridge and it is very lemon sour. You can get this in small ($4) or large ($6).   Easily my top favorite place for gyro. Must try for any Mediterranean food lovers. And if you do decide to stop by, make sure to check-in on yelp for 20% off your order.",

    "text": "Pomegranate chicken gyro + 1/2 order of Plato's Potatoes = A-OK Chicken was very dry, and the main reason I got the gyro over the wrap was the addition of Feta- of which there was so little it didn't really matter. Fries were seasoned well, and paired with a spicy yogurt sauce. Fries were tastier without the sauce, but it wasn't bad.  Order was takeout, and staff present was just okay- walked in and wasn't addressed for a while, was helped by the manager who eventually asked if I was ready while other employees ignored me. I seemed to be interrupting their closing duties and conversation, my bad.  The spanakopita and avgolemeno soup sound tasty, but I'll likely try another location. I agree with Betty W's review calling their pricing \"ballsy'- $13 is a bit high for my meal, $4 to add on a veggie skewer is ri-donk.",

They make them clock in 5 mins before the actual time because their clocks are 5 minutes fast. Then at the end of the night they adjust the employees time taking away the 5 minutes even though they worked those 5 mins. They also do not pay overtime after 8 hours. My son brought up these illegal activities to the owner and he was told the law states overtime only after 40 hours. My son challenged him and told him it was supposed to be after 8 hours also, unless you make a high enough hourly wage, which he did not.  A couple days later he was  fired. The way they fired him was,  he had called in asking what day and time he was to work on the new schedule. They told him 6pm on a certain day. When he went in they said he was supposed to be at work at 12:30 earlier that day. So they set him up to be fired. Sleezy owners. I will never take my business there again, and never recommend them.",

I picked the pomegranate chicken and my friend got the traditional gyro wrap plate. It comes with a large drink. This place has enough staff to attend to you immediately. I've never waited for anything. It was my friends birthday and I ordered their gluten free pumpkin cake with a baklava crusting. It was the best! Very creamy and yet the whip cream wasn't too sweet. The waiter came with a candle and match! Very polite staff. I felt like I just sniffed my plate of pomegranate chicken, it disappeared ! Not even a dot of morsel left. I like the sauce and the sweet taste. Try this! And because I liked it a lot I even took a gyro sandwich home. I will definitely come back in this place.",

    "text": "If you're in the mood for greek food, this place is the place for you!  I was seriously craving gyros so my boyfriend and I decided to come here. As soon as we walk in we were greeted then sat down at a booth. It was a tuesday night so it was pretty slow, not many people there at the time which we kind of like. As soon as we sat down our server asked if we wanted any drinks and at the time we just ordered waters. After she left we realized they had a special that night for $2 off beers. So of course we were going to take advantage of that! We ordered to blue moons and they were on tap so they tasted sooo good. Everything on the menu sounded so good, but in the end I decided to get a lamb gyro platter, my boyfriend decided on the pasta angelo and we got platos potatoes to share.  The platos potatoes were really good, they're basic fries but the seasoning that was on them made them stand out. We couldn't stop eating them!  The lamb gyro platter was huge. It comes with the gyro, side of rice, side of pita bread and a side salad. They served the salad way ahead of the rest of the platter which was nice, it gave me time to eat it before the rest of my food came. The lamb gyro was AMAZING. The lamb was so tender and juicy, had a good amount of lettuce, tomato and sauce. It was exactly what I wanted! The rice was really good too. Nicely seasoned. The pita bread they gave me was plain jane but they gave me hummus to go with it so that was really nice too.  The pasta angelo plate seemed like it didn't come with a lot, but my boyfriend couldn't finish the dish it was so filling! He was pleasantly surprised. He loved the flavors, the pasta had spinach, mushrooms, tarragon and a nice buttery sauce.  All in all, this place is really good. It's a perfect place for a little date night, or if you're just really craving greek food. The service is nice, the food is great and filling. The portions here are huge so you definitely get what you pay for! I will be coming here more often for sure.",

    "text": "Ended up for lunch at Market Grille Cafe one day to get my Greek on.  It's OK!  Ordered off the 'Build Your Own' lunch menu for $7.50.  Comes with your choice of a main:  -Gyro (traditional beef & lamb, chicken, or veggie) -Pomegranate Chicken -Mediterranean Wrap (chicken, gyro, falafel, or veggie)  And choice of a side: -Fries (Greek seasoned) -Basmati Rice -Salad (spinach or Greek)  I ordered the traditional Gyro and a side of fries.  Didn't take long for our order to come to our table, maybe about 10 minutes.  I admit, it looked pretty darn good.  Serving size was alright.  I could have used a few more fries on my plate, those things were yummy!  Fresh, hot, and covered in Greek seasoning (which I think has some paprika) & fresh herbs.  The Gyro was good as well, lots of meat (little aftertaste of laaaaammmmmbbbbb), fresh tomatoes, a nice tangy tzatziki sauce, feta cheese, chopped parsley, and a load of red onions!  Like, lots of them!  Luckily, I like onions.  Others may have been a bit put off by them.  But what's Greek food without red onions?  Less stinky LOL.  My big gripe about this lunch menu?  Why doesn't this combo come with a damn drink??  For that much moolah you should get at least a small soda!  What am I gonna drink with all those onions?  I did ask for a water cup, which I was happily obliged.  But still, did it drown out my lovely onion breath?  Hell no!  Eh, and I resort to an Altoid.  Overall the Gyro was pretty tasty.  The lamb/beef meat combo was flavorful and not dry, but that freshness from the tzatziki sauce and parsley took it home.  The pita was supple and airy, but with enough heft to hold up all the ingredients.  I managed to finish my lunch up nicely.  I'd be back to Market Grill Cafe more if the price for a Gyro was a bit more reasonable.  I like Greek and Mediterranean food, but me being a cheapy eater leaves me with no qualms going to Chipotle a few doors down for a lower priced fatty burrito (believe me, I often break tortillas with fillings), or In N Out right across the street.  Market Grill Cafe...let me have a drink!  Opa!",

This eliminated the need for a server which was nice.",

The one on Lake Mead is now closest to me and great for stopping in for either a quick bite or to grab a to-go box.  They have great salads, gyros, fries, and the pumpkin soup is one of my favorites.  If you have room the pumpkin baklava cheesecake is really good but rich.  If you want something sweet but a little lighter the rice pudding is always spot on.  I also like that they offer gluten free, a vegetarian, and vegan dishes so that just about anyone can find something great.  Now that they're doing a happy hour, I may need to stop in more often.  Oh! Make sure to check in and you'll get a coupon.  I'll just save mine until next time which shouldn't be too long.",

The ordering process for lunch 11:30-3 is limited to a build your own menu. Place your order, pay, then sit ,and your food will be brought to you. Dinner is a sit down/full service/full menu type experience so make sure you check your watch before you come depending on what type of service you would like.  I like the vegetarian/ vegan options they offer.  I have had dine in and take out here. Both were of good quality with friendly service and food was fresh and very tasty. So yes, I will be back and I'll encourage my friends to join me.  PS. The parking lot is always busy so be prepared to drive slowly and carefully while you search for a spot.",

Finding a parking spot might be a task but one will eventually open.   The dining room area is decorated lovely.  It's open, clean and inviting.  Service is good.  It was nice to have people coming around to refill my water and clear any plates.  Very nice.    I ordered their lunch special of choosing two items for 7.50.  There is a check in deal that takes 20% off but you can't use it with the lunch deals. It's still a nice deal.  I chose the traditional gyro with the basmati rice.  The lamb and beef had a great flavor.  Tender and full of flavor.  The rice was light and airy.  It had a great flavor as well.    It's a nice place and wouldn't mind stopping in again.",

There's a large menu on the wall when you walk in and once you decide what you want, you can order at the cash register. They have AMAZING lunch specials for only $8.50... gyro, Mediterranean wraps, chicken & veggie kabob with a drink and your choice of sides: rice, fries, greek salad... If you check in on yelp you'll get 20% off which will bring your total to around $7.50 after tax.   The food comes out very quickly. I ordered the traditional gyro (beef and lamb) with the yogurt dill sauce & a greek salad. The pita bread that they use to wrap everything in was so soft. I've been to other places where the pita bread was very chewy and hard. They do give A LOT of meat and I had a hard time eating the gyro so I eventually dumped everything out on top of my salad. All the ingredients were super fresh and the dressing for the greek salad wasn't overwhelming.   My friend got the Mediterranean wrap with a spinach tortilla and pomegranate chicken. She got it with fries that came with a really good dipping sauce. The fries were crispy but not burnt and perfectly seasoned.   We also shared cannolis. I've only had cannolis twice before and didn't really like them. The cannoli here had a creamy cinnamon filling and a crunchy shell. I couldn't get enough of the filling!  I came here twice in a row and can not wait to come back.",

I like the gyros the hummus and the spinach pie but some of the pasta dishes leave a lot to be desired.  I find it insulting that they have to put a sign on the soda machine reminding the patrons with water cups not to steal soda.  And the \"opas\" for tips seems like orchestrated begging.  Service is good but parking is tough st lunch in this location.",

    "text": "I don't quiet understand all the good reviews for this place. If I could divide this review into two different categories of service and food, I would. I would give 4 stars to service. I went there for the first time and didn't know the menu. The lady behind the counter was very friendly and helped me pick something out of the menu. They had a lunch special but somehow we ended up paying way too much for just lunch. And that brings us to the second category: Food.   I'm not sure if this place is listed as Greek/ Mediterranean food; but if you have ever had authentic Mediterranean food, you would know that the tzatziki is a Greek yogurt sauce with tons of garlic. They call theirs \"dill sauce\" and it was yogurt with dill, no spices, no garlic, no flavor. Hubby and  I ordered the gyros, which was also too dry and without any flavor. Last but not least, the desert... We ordered a baklava.   First of all, the piece they sell you is huge and they charge about $5. There is no way anyone would be able to finish that piece by themselves and if they could, well, then they should reconsider their dietary choices. Second of all, if you have ever had baklava before then you would know that it shouldn't taste like you are licking cinnamon's butt hole. Excuse my language but there was so much cinnamon and sugar in that piece of baklava that hubby and I both almost chocked on our first and the only bite.   My recommendation: This place needs a serious revision of the menu. They should either stick with the Greek/ Mediterranean theme and learn how to make those dishes, or change their menu completely. Also, if you are looking for a more authentic taste of the Mediterranean cuisine, you might want to try Stephanos' or Baladie Cafe (my favorite).",

The wait staff is well-trained and highly motivated.    The young woman who served our table was beautiful with a highly cute personality.  You would attack Troy for her.

I'll eat them but I can't eat for several hours afterwords because it feels like a rock in my stomach. This place leaves me feeling full, but fresh. Love it. It's clear all of their foods are made with fresh ingredients. Little to no grease from what I order (pomegranate chicken gyro platter and hummus appetizer). Their salads are awesome, portions are good. And I cannot get pomegranate chicken anywhere else lol. I'm slightly addicted.  The service is ALWAYS friendly btw. I have been there numerous times in different times of the day and they are always very nice and attentive to me. Their ice tea tastes so fresh too! Pretty sure it's brewed. Too good to come from syrup.  I also work in fast food and I'm constantly trying to spot anything dirty (force of habit), but this place is always clean.  I would definitely recommend this place.  And for the specialized dieters, they have vegetarian, vegan, and gluten free options as well!!!!!",

Also an appetizer of stuffed (lamb, currants, rice, pinenuts, beef) grape leaves served warm with buttery lemon sauce, which was excellent !  The gyro salad & the traditional gyro were HUGE, and very flavorful. Great tasting,  perfectly seasoned. Pricing very fair for what you get,  eating here will not break the bank. Our meall came to $27 + tip.  Would I eat here again?  YES. Would I recommend?  YES. This food is \"\"home made \"\" .  The service staff was friendly and attentive. The atmosphere is casual .

The spanokopita isnt fresh. The filo dough which is supposed to be crispy was soft and mushy almost like it was premade yesterday and reheated. Even the basmati rice had a strange flavor and texture of instant rice. The tzaziki sauce like another reviewer said tasted only of dill. This is my 2nd time trying this place since I wanted to give them another chance and both times have disappointed me. I don't understand how this place is voted 'Best of Las Vegas' 5 years in a row. Again as stated in another review, try Yassou on West Charleston. The owner is Greek and the food is authentic. Also another good place is The Great Greek Grill in Henderson. I will never come here again.",

I just so happen to be frequenting some really delish joints as of late.  Love the ambiance of Market Grille Cafe.  Not too hoity-toity, yet not ultra casual either.  The woman taking my order was engaging and I asked her why the business had not ventured to the other side of town.  She reassured me that there was something in the works (hold tight East-siders!).  I ordered the Lunch Special Traditional Gyro which comes with a bottle of water or fountain drink for $7.50.  I never thought I would experience a gyro which was comparable to the gyros in my college town.  Call it college town elitism, but their gyros were seriously sensational.  I think those gyros have finally met their match.  The lamb meat mixture at Market Grille wasn't overly salty which I have found to be the case at Gyro Time.  The tzatziki sauce, oh the tzatziki sauce (they don't actually refer to their sauce as tzatziki but rather yogurt dill), was perfectly seasoned, just the right amount of dill as to not overpower the flavor of the lamb.  The gyro featured vegetables such as onions, cucumber, and lettuce.  They don't skimp on the meat and one gyro is enough for lunch.  I appreciated the less than 10 minute wait for my food considering how ravenous I was.  Can't wait for them to open a restaurant closer to home.  Thanks for a great meal!      Bonus: The Cupcakery is just a few stores down.  In my opinion, a Southern Bell cupcake is the perfect way to finish up any meal.",

    "text": "My husband and I recently moved to the area from Henderson and we admittedly have pretty high standards when it comes to Greek food. We decided to give Market Grille Cafe a try, based on the reviews and proximity to our house. The decor isn't exactly inviting or particularly Greek or Mediterranean, which should have been our first clue. The flow is a little weird; you order at the registers and they bring your food to your table for you. There isn't a ton of space in the register area and it gets congested quite easily. I did appreciate the Yelp check in offer, which I had no problem redeeming with the cashier. My husband and I had trouble locating a menu, but one of the girls eventually brought us a little brochure and we both decided on the Greek Gyro and an order of their seasoned fries. The cashier asked if we wanted yogurt sauce on our gyros, strike two! Gyros should always come with tzatziki sauce! I then ventured over to the corner to get some water from the fountain, there was a sign on the Soda Machine saying that Soda was not free. Seriously? I'm sure this is a minor issue in all restaurants, people saying that they would like water and then filling their cup with soda, but the soda costs virtually nothing. I have never seen this sign anywhere else and it was slightly offensive, let's not patronize our customers OK? When the food arrived it was lackluster at best. The gyro meat was cold and the yogurt sauce was just yogurt and dill. The fries were covered in Paprika and were served with a side of yogurt sauce with hot sauce mixed in, not good. The food was edible, but far from a delicious Greek meal and a definite disappointment.",
