(even tho it was a dollar or two more than the ramen house's i usually go to in chinatown) My ramen was super good, but the kimchi didnt seem so fresh to me.  I will be back , yum",

    "text": "We're so excited to have a ramen place in our neck of the woods...it's long overdue.  We tried the crunch roll sushi; it was fresh, just spicy enough without being too spicy, and a hit with everyone at the table.  My son had the tempura shrimp and veggies; I may or may not have stolen his onion ring.  The batter was crunchy and also a great consistency.  The fried rice was good, and I really enjoyed my tonkotsu ramen.  I was debating between mild and spicy; I found the mild to be spicy enough.  The portion was filling, and I ordered extra noodles but they really weren't necessary.  The broth was very good, and the noodles were a little on the thick side.  The service was attentive and everyone we talked to was very friendly.  It's just barely below Chinatown-caliber ramen, but seriously for location we can't beat it.  We'll be back soon!",

I have ordered takeout, dined in, and had ramen delivered on Door Dash from the Ichi Ramen House, and I have nothing but positive comments to make about every experience. I love the tonkotsu ramen, the sushi rolls, and the beverage selection. For each ramen dish, you get to choose how spicy and which ingredients to add or leave out. The noodles are cooked to perfection consistently. The wait staff is always polite, even when the restaurant is busy (and it definitely does get busy on weekend nights- calling ahead is a great idea!). I have eaten here SO many times, and I will definitely be back!",

The staff was well trained using the technology and they are fast. The price is right were you want to be for lunch. The ramen is priced just right just under $ 8 bucks a bowl and you get quite a bit.  The bar also has usb and regular outlets for phones. The water comes out in a glass  container and doesn't taste like tap water. That always is a plus when it doesnt smell and taste like chlorine. There were over 20 people waiting outside to get in for lunch when I left. The wait in line is worth the quality of food.   Great Place and we will be back.",

I had the black garlic ramen with California roll and hubby had seafood ramen and crunchy roll. Garlic ramen  mmmmmm, yummy. The rolls were good and good size considering it's included in a combo. The salad that was included had a ginger lemony dressing, which was great. Seafood ramen was ok, tomato broth  was super tomatoey  and overpowered other flavors. Will go back for sure especially with the weather getting colder. Oh... service was fast and friendly.",

However, they can improved it by adding a little bit more broth coz the bowl is about 1/3 full and it look anemic. The noodles are over-cooked and a little saggy.. lol like cup O noodles at Walmart, yuck... Needs improvement. The extra garlic chips becomes soft which is ok, but don't put to much. The half egg was overdone. The broth is actually good and very rich in taste.   For the price, it's ok. Employees are nice and little confuse sometimes. Maybe they're new.

Service was good and friendly. The dining room isn't very big so there was a 15 minute wait (not too bad) during the lunch rush on a Thursday.   The only negative was the mochi ice cream.

    "text": "What a great time of year to set up shop, especially a ramen noodle shop! We have our go-to's in the central valley area, but missed having a good ramen place in the northwest.  Ichi fills the need for us. As is the case with most ramen houses, it's a small location and can get very crowded with a long wait, especially on a Friday or Saturday date night. I was first there on a weekday late lunchtime and had no wait. But on the night hubby came with me, it was packed. There isn't much room inside to wait, so put your name on the list and let them know you'll be outside hanging around.    The wait was worth it for us--rewarded with bowls of steaming hot ramen in a miso broth for me and the original broth for him. The chashu was breakapart tender and tasty, the softly-boiled egg and garnishes as they should be.  I don't go to a noodle house to have sushi or gyoza, but if you are so inclined, those are also on the menu.  Once you're seated, their service is very attentive and prompt.  Hubby has been with me to Monta, Sora, and Jinya and he was understandably pleased to have somewhere nearby where we could get some good customer service along with a nice bowl of ramen.",

I could say their food was pretty good!! I ordered the ramen combo with the miso ramen with mild spice, salad, and gyozas. Came here on a weekday night an hour before closing, there was no wait. Food didn't take long to come out we were in and out, so it was a quick bite to eat. I enjoyed their ramen, my bf ordered the black garlic ramen with no spice...and I liked his also. Their portions were good size. Our total bill for 1 combo & 1 extra ramen was about $25. I can definitely count on coming back since it's less than 10 minutes away from home.",

Isn't it common sense to not smoke within a couple feet of the restaurant WITH THE DOOR OPEN? One of the customers stood up from their meal and had to close the back door. As for the vapist, I was able to see her cloud of smoke rush in through the door, into our dining area. She must have been smoking right next to the open door. As for the actual service, expect every.single.server. at the front of the house to come up to you every 5 minutes to ask you the same question. They seriously take turns and come at you every 2 mouthfuls.  Food: Miso ramen is too bland. Broth is pretty rich and a tad bit more saltiness would change the game.  Don't order karaage here thinking of the real deal. Their karaage is the size of popcorn shrimp, no joke. I felt so cheated because their meat doesn't even seem marinated. They just give you tons of sauce on the side. All of my takoyakis were crushed and you can just feel the sloppiness on each dish.",

Most Ramen places, while delicious, leave me feeling sick later because of the sodium/salt in the food. This is the first place that doesn't. I've tried the Black Garlic and the Classic and both were delicious without being overly salted. Makes me feel like the ingredients and broth is fresher.  Also, I don't know why this place has two $$ because most bowls are 7.95-11.95. Pretty affordable if you ask me! And the portion is PERFECT!!! I don't feel wasteful but I always leave full. You can also order extra noodles and other filling for like $2. The only problem I have is that the place is small so the line can get a little long... though we haven't waited longer than 15 min. I hope they expand as it's becoming a popular spot!!",

We both ordered combos that came with a salad and sushi roll.  The salad was the most melancholy thing I've ever seen as it only has lettuce and no other vegetable.  The sushi rolls were nice, but nothing amazing.  There wasn't any soy sauce left so they gave us take away packets.  The wasabi had no kick.  It was so weak it couldn't defend itself in a fight.  They got my friend's order wrong when she asked for no onions in her ramen so she had to send it back.  I ordered the tomato seafood ramen, which I enjoyed.  So in the end, the service wasn't too great, but their ramen is good.  We probably won't be back.",

    "text": "Busy, yes. Limited seating, yes. Which could be why it appears busier had it been alot more spacious in there. I've been to many ramen houses not only in the valley, but ramen houses in Japan...and honestly, they've all been pretty limited in seating. Does it suck having to wait in the brrrr because of a verryy verrrry limited seating area in the waiting area? Yeah. When it's busy, those waiting tend to stand behind those seated at the bar. If I were eating and there were people standing behind me...it'd ruin my vibe for real.   None-the-less, I've had to wait about a good 20mins before being seated, thankfully, not at the bar. I don't really recommend this place if you have a large group (7+) because your wait could be even longer, and most likely you'll be separated. I think to alleviate their lobby, they should seriously consider the beeper system so people don't feel the worry of missing their name being called.   I do appreciate the fact when their waiting area is crowded, a hostess will go around asking if everyone's name has been jotted down jussst incase, you know. There's always that one person who enters, that'll just stand there disoriented at all the busyness. Lol.  Each visit I have stuck with my order of the crispy rice tuna and the black garlic ramen. The first time my crispy rice tuna was not as crispy, so it did break on me while picking it up with my chopstick. While I was bummed about that...it was still good and at that point, tis all that mattered. Besides, crispy rice is merely texture. The next time I visited, they got the crispy rice on point. My tastebuds was amused.  If you like gah-lic at all...the black garlic ramen is the way to go. It was delicious on each visit, my ramen noodles were cooked fantastically, and that garlicky essence was present, annnd I have yet to experience a bland or salty visit. Lol. My broth came out at a nice temp to warm my chest and make me sniffle.   It could easily be a 3.5 star experience for many, but 4 stars for me because I'm not going to compare it with other places. We have a ramen joint in the NW, y'all. Appreciate -because it'll save you a drive. Our area is slowly but surely picking up on the food vibe. Parking is much easier than alot of other places, staff is busy but not neglectful and friendly.   Keep the stroller at home, parents. They do have high-chairs! Definitely recommend giving them a shot especially if you're in the area. I find it worth the try. I appreciate the fact that the prices doesn't seem to be inflated because of its advantage being the only ramen spot in the vicinity.   Enjoy!",

    "text": "I was really happy to see this place open close to home. Normally, we were stuck driving towards Henderson or the Southwest of Las Vegas to grab a piping hot bowl of ramen since we reside in greater Centennial area.  I have been to this spot a handful of times. On a few of vista, the wait was too long for my taste, so I ended up going elsewhere. This spot is super small so anticipate a wait on a weekend or evenings - over 30/45 minutes at times. To avoid this, we now call ahead before driving out to check on the line.   The few times I was able to sit down without much of a wait, I thought the service was good, and the prices were reasonable. Presentation, size, and the overall heartiness of the bowls we sampled were as just as expected.  To date, my husband and I enjoy the black garlic ramen. We are garlic lovers and really enjoyed our bowls. The broth and the garlic paired perfectly together and we slurped down our bowls quickly.   On a separate visit, we each sampled the Curry Ramen, and it fell short for us. The curry had thicker noodles, pork, and a thicker, spicier broth. It was not bad by any means - we both felt that the black garlic was more flavorful and enjoyable. This was just our preference.   This restaurant is a good ramen joint and a welcomed addition to the Northwest area. Although this spot is solid, I believe there are some amazing ramen joints in town that rank ahead of it in my mind. It is a solid  'A-OK' and we will still be back to enjoy the black garlic ramen bowls.",

As for the food, we ended up getting the black garlic ramen, which is one of the best ramen I have had here in Vegas! The flavor was perfect and it wasn't salty as some of the post has stated. I love garlic and you can definitely taste the garlic! I added corn and nori to mine.  We also ordered the gyoza, which is a tad smaller in size compared to other places. The chicken karaage was good with their mayo sauce, but again, it was small pieces compared to other places. However, on a positive note, it was the perfect size for my toddler to have as a meal.   We ordered the kids a regular miso with noodle only.  The flavors were just spot on! I guess I'm just use to the American portion size. I would definitely be coming back here everytime I come back into town! I highly recommend the black garlic ramen.",

They have chopsticks on table but if you can't eat your salad or soup with them just ask for forks!!   The food is amazing. This is our second time here and delicious both times.  We did order two orders of gyoza one was hot and the other was Luke warm. That was a bummer but still good.   The facility is clean and looks like they strive to keep it clean. The place is small not a lot of seating and it gets pretty busy. I don't think they anticipated they were going to be such a huge hit!! Maybe when it warms up they will open seating outside.   If you like ramen this is a great place to try!!",

I almost always get the Black Garlic Ramen. Tonkotsu broth is just right & the ingredients mesh well together. I do love love love their spicy sauce which I always have on the side. So I can dip my chashu well without compromising the flavor of the broth. I also use it as a dip for my sushi roll. Today, I highly complimented their ramen  Thank you for your great work.

Late Saturday afternoon rush was in effect hear, with 4 parties in front of us and two behind us and a full dining room...they must be doing something right.  I tried the Curry Ramen this visit along with edamame app. The broth was thick and creamy with delicious curry flavor that was enhanced as the the bottom of the bowl came near. The noodles are accompanied by chopped scallions, corn and a pan fried chicken breast sliced into 1\" strips.  The dish was served with a generous portion of noodles which I swear we're tied to the bottom of the bowl because I struggled to get them into my mouth. Or maybe I just suck at using chopsticks. I really enjoyed this bowl of curry broth goodness.  Edamame was typical of what you would expect anywhere. No sense in trying to get creative in the explaination, keep it simple like this dish with just a hint of sea salt.   Really excited to go back here. My better half wants to come everyday. She enjoyed her Vegetarian Ramen very much. Her favorite part was the large chunks of tempura broccoli and soft boiled egg add on.   So Delicious!!!",

    "text": "I've never been to a Ramen place before because well, I don't feel that I should spend a lot of money on Ramen that I can throw in a pot and cook at home for pennies. I saw this place had just opened not too long ago and it's down the street from me so I figured now's my chance to try it out and see what everybody says I've been missing.  I will say that I did actually enjoy the meal I had. I got the combination platter so I got a salad, a side of my choice and a big bowl of Ramen and it was decently priced. I got the Black Garlic Ramen and it was actually really good. It's VERY garlicy, but if you like garlic, you'll love it. We all tried different sides and different Ramen and they were all pretty good. The crunch roll and gyoza were good. The fried rice was good too. The chicken one however, I didn't think was that great. It tasted like the normal chicken Ramen that you would make at home, nothing special. I don't have any other restaurants to compare anything too, but it's worth checking.   Downside is that the place is very, very small and chances are you're going to have to wait. There's a few seats at the bar, a couple tables and some booths. I wouldn't recommend going with more than a party of 4 because of how small the place is and how tight the seating is. I think it makes a great date night spot though. Not a huge fan of their drinks either. They charge per can of soda, which can get pricey if you're eating something spicy or just tend to drink a lot.",

However we were on the northwest side of town and saw Ichi was still open and decided to try a new spot!   We ordered the Shishito peppers, Gyoza and 2 Spicy Miso Ramens. The shishito was good till we got to the bottom ones, they were drenched in the miso sauce which made them too sweet. The gyoza was flavorful, but softer than other gyoza's we are used to. The ramen was ok...it wasn't too salty and I like that. The broth wasn't too heavy, the noodles didn't seem fresh and kind of under cooked. Over all it wasn't too bad. I'd go again if I were ever on that side of town, but would not go out of my way for it.",

Staff was great, they just gave me the wrong ramen at first and then waited another 10 minutes to get the one I ordered. It's understandable since it was a busy Saturday night and mistakes happen. Anyways, I'm here for the Ramen, only tried some potstickers which were good as well, didn't try any other sides. It's so cold outside, I need to go back!",

The service is fast, and friendly and any slight issue we have had the in the past, management insisted on offering us something to make it right, even though we told him it wasn't necessary. It's on the small side so sometimes there's a wait during busier times but we don't mind because the turnover is generally pretty quick and the ramen is worth it. It's a filling portion although for meat eaters it is the smallest portion of meat (chashu)  amongst my top three ramen places, which is no matter to me as I'm not a big pork-eater anyway, but may be alarming to someone who is. They have Sapporo on draft which is a huge pro in my book and if ever you're in the mood for more than noodles and broth, they have appetizers/sushi to fill you up. They close earlier on Sunday at 9, which I wish they would reconsider, but they usually play K-pop so my teenager (and me I'll admit) is always down to go since the music is good!",

I'm only in centennial occasionally so I definitely make sure to stop in when in I'm the area and if they had one on blue Diamond I'd be in multiple times a week.",

The chasu rice seems to be good but the last time I got it I found a small piece of paper in it. The service is also okay. Our favorite ramen shops are still Sora and Monta. Hopefully they can work on thier consistency and flavor. For the time being, we will have to drive down to China town for Ramen.",

I ordered the miso ramen and my partner ordered the curry ramen with chicken. Her broth had more flavor than my miso but her chicken was flavorless as well... The only good thing was the shrimp tempura because of the sauce. Won't be coming here again",

There was no room to really wait while your food was prepared. It was just mass chaos. And this was during the week. I can only imagine what it's like on a weekend. Not to mention, all that wait for nothing. The broth was over oily and flavorless. Overall the food was just bland and kind of gross.",

They offer a meal where you can get ramen, a salad and appetizer. The ramen portion size was HUGE. The gyoza was really good, and the salad with their house dressing was excellent!

    "text": "Very solid Ramen House, and a welcome addition to the Centennial area.  Pros:  1. The Ramen here is very good. Good broth vs noodles/meat/veggies ratio, and the ingredients are always flavorful. Their black garlic dish is one of my favorites there, and its highly recommended.   2. Appetizers are solid. They also serve tako yaki here, which is a big bonus, and its done well. The sushi part is acceptable, but not great by any stretch as it's primarily standard california roll type stuff. But hey, you're not here for the sushi, right? There's a million and a half places in town for that.  3. Staff is always friendly and on the ball with your orders and general service.   4. Prices are on target, and you won't leave feeling like you broke the bank.  Cons:  1. It's tiny. Seating is always limited strictly due to the size of the place, meaning wait times are inevitable, especially on weekends when there's more customers. Expect a wait of around 15-45 minutes, give or take, during the evening. Short of knocking down the walls and expanding, there isn't much they can for that. Unavoidable as it is, I have to knock one star down for it, though I'd only knock a half one down if Yelp allowed.",

My seafood Ramen sadly only came with 3 nickel sized clams & 2 small shrimps-- so we paid an extra $5 for not even a palm size amount of seafood. I'll rather make the extra drive to China town and enjoy a bowl of money worth Ramen.  Their water was served at room temperature which sometimes people like but when it's 100+ degrees out a nice cold cup of water will be great. I had to ask for 2 cups full of ice and filled them up with water and waited a few minutes for my water to be cold & refreshing.",

At least the fried rice can be modified. It's worrisome that their yelp page claims to have vegan options, yet their staff seems to have no idea. The food was okay, the service was less than. The servers were friendly -- although they seemed a little lost? Possibly new hires -- and the restaurant was clean. We got there when it was fairly empty, yet somehow it took forever for someone to come take our order/refill our drinks (the check, however, took a matter of seconds.)  The servers seemed to be chatting around the register. The soup came out quickly, appetizers took a little bit longer. We got the shishito peppers (without the bonito flakes) and agedashi tofu, both were delicious. My date got the black garlic ramen, which she said was alright. This place came highly recommended, I'm sure on another day it could've been different or I would have felt better about my experience here buuutttttttt... it's unlikely that I'll be returning anytime soon. It honestly felt like everything was half-a$$ed.",

When walking in we were greeted by a really nice left handed guy who got ya on the waiting list sadly I didnt get his name because he literally was the only great service we received ... he got our name on the list and told us we had a 10 minute wait which was no problem . We got a to go menu to look at but while my mom was checking it out I received a phone call so I didn't get the chance to decide my food .  Once seated we had Soo who got our drink orders but from that moment on she was rushing us to order . I don't know about you but I hate feeling rushed especially when I patiently waited for my seat plus I was trying to decide on different appetizer choices and browse photos of items .  Anyhow we ended up getting the popcorn shrimp be the chicken appetizer plus I got a jalapeno bomb thing . All the appetizers were decent nothing amazing but the salad side with the chicken and shrimp were really good the dressing was bomb and the portions were pretty large .  I got the garlic ramen soup and it was really good I know others complained about salt but mine was tasty .  When our food was delivered by Ash it was my soup and jalapeno popper I asked for a fork not only was her attitude bad but no fork came when I finally got soo she got me a fork but I saw Ash continually being grumpy and over all it was her day .  Later the chicken and shrimp and my moms fried rice showed up ..  Once we were done I literally was waiting while my mom was in the restroom to try to get another soda but when I had to flag my server down I was so annoyed I opted to get to go boxes and the check.  For rushing me to order and then having to wait for my fork and then not getting the option to give them the 1.50 more for another soda and for having delays and such this was only two stars .  I'll probably be back again purely due to the location but I hope I get better service ...",

The creamy tonkatsu is my favorite. I love the broth and the toppings. Portion size isn't as big as other places, but still decent. I also tried the gyoza and kimchi fried rice, which were both yummy.   The restaurant is pretty small with limited seating. Every time I've come here it's been crazy packed with a long wait. I've only been for dinner though, so it may be different during lunch. The waiting area isn't that big, so if you don't snag a seat on the bench you'll probably find yourself waiting outside.   Definitely recommend this place especially if you live around the area.",

Carry out was quick to order and we were in our way.    We tried many different items off the menu since it was new to us.  We had the jalapeno bomb, gyoza potstickers, edamame, and shrimp tempura appetizers and would recommend them all!  I wondered how tempura would be as take out.  I was impressed with how light and crispy it was, not greasy at all.  For entrees, we tried the chicken ramen and the original spicy ramen.  My sons only complaint was that it wasn't spicy enough.  The ingredients were fresh and everything tasted great.  We will be going back again!  Parking is free and easy.  They share the lot with a few other food vendors, and a Walmart further back, so plenty of parking!  Suggestion to owners (hint:) They have a great patio area on the side, which I'm hoping they will add tables to for the spring and summer if their landlord will allow it.",

I would have given it 5 Stars, however they were a little skimpy on the seafood and the meat. And the chicken karaage was so so. My wife had the Tomato Seafood Ramen, The Taste was excellent but there was only one shrimp and one oyster. I had the black garlic Ramen and it was also fantastic, but it could have used a little more pork . I will come back again and again. Oh and the service was excellent as well.",

They are new so I understand being a little unorganized. It was just a bummer that the server avoided us until the food was ready, no apology for the long wait, and no explanation...after we finished he dropped the check and walked away, I don't know about you but I say have a good night, thank you after guests leave. So I really hope they can get their shit together so centennial hills can enjoy our damn ramen :-)   UPDATE:  Well It's been three weeks, we came back for the delicious food and it was still very good! Although sadly only half our order came out and the other two people we ate with didn't get their food until we were done :( The server didn't even notice the food hadn't come out and she had to put the order in again shortly after... still love it but still disappointed. We did notice however that there was a server (kevin) who went above and beyond and was on top of all of his tables. He even stopped to help us a few times. We will request him next time !",

Other than that, the customer service seemed to be great/friendly and the atmosphere/decoration was traditional and nice.

This ramen house is a legit ramen place, whenever I look for a good ramen I always look for a good broth. And this place has a pretty good broth, I would say about the same taste as monta ramen.  Now I really liked the broth but there is room for improvement, their soft boiled egg was not soft boiled. I know it's a new place but I love my soft boil egg, I don't want hard boiled egg in my ramen. Another room for improvement is their Chashu pork. I like the chashu pork really tender, I think they didn't slow cook their pork. Me and my girlfriend ordered a karaage as well and it's not bad, but it looks like chicken nuggets.  Overall I gave it 4 star.",

We are big fans of ramen and this place was great! They had lots of different things to choose from if you weren't up for ramen or not that hungry.  My family and I all tried different ramen, tonkatsu, black garlic, chicken broth (I think?), and the miso.  The tonkatsu and black garlic were definitely the best.  Prices were great and staff was amazing! Thankful we have this place so close to home!",

Friendly, fast and welcoming. They remembered my name too. Awesome.    Ramen was tasty. I had the miso ramen with some extras. I read other reviews and agree it was a bit salty. I was informed though if I like it less salty, I should choose either the chicken, creamy or vegetable broth since (as I learned) miso broths are typically on the salty side. My only suggestion would be to either address the complaints and adjust the salt level in the broths (guests can always add more, right??) or inform the guest that it's a little on the salty side when they order. No apps this time, just da souuuuuuuup. Gotta try the black garlic next time.   Clean decor and good prices. Great menu variety with some unique/not often found apps. It's a small place, so don't think you can just bum rush in there with 7 of y'all on a Friday night and expect to get sat immediately.  Plan appropriately.   Okay. Nap time.",

The results were Ichi Ramen House and although I have never purchased ramen to go, I had to in this instance and my wait time was approximately 35 minutes on a Sunday. Not too bad of a wait in my opinion for lunchtime on a weekend for a ramen restaurant with high reviews.  When I arrived to pick up my order, there was a slew of people waiting outside to be seated. This made me even more optimistic about the food here. When I arrived, my food was ready and it seemed like it had been ready for a hot minute because it was way in the back of the food orders that were ready to be picked up. I ordered the traditional ramen and when I got home I was pretty disappointed as soon as I opened it up. It didn't look traditional at all. The serving size was tiny and it looked like a creamy ramen broth, which is not my preference. I also requested the poached egg and it was definitely hard-boiled, not poached. The chicken was very dry and almost impossible to cut or separate with chopsticks. I was so disappointed overall. I may give this place a shot and try ordering in rather than requesting a to-go meal, but I've tried my fair share of ramen houses and this would be my last choice on the list.",

It won't be on the list of top 3 ramens in town, but broth is tasty, has a slight kick if you ask for it, and basic comes with a lot of goodies like bamboo shoot and egg.  The tonkatsu had more of a pork broth than your ramen/umami combo, so very good for the kids and those looking for an easy-going ramen.  Came with egg (well overcooked), bamboo shoot, and onion.  Noodles were basic and very closely resembled instant.  Ichi is pretty cheap under $10 and offers sake, beer, and soju.  Though they close early so not your typical drinking spot.  Line was insane at 8pm on a sunday with a 30 minute wait.  Place is tiny, but service was quick once seated.  Many people did take out which seemed like the way to go at Ichi.  Sapporo and Ichi are owned by the same company and both were very good - I hope this company keeps expanding with different cuisines, hopefully on the west side.",

Lol The black garlic ramen is off the hook! Soooo tasty and fresh. And the portions are huge! I also love the crispy rice with tuna. You can't often find places where you leave STUFFED for under $20 in such a clean place with a cool atmosphere and great service! The menu is simple but hits every flavor profile with just enough options. All three visits I made were on point and the dishes tasted exactly the same as before. There's a lot of options for ramen in Vegas but none like this. Make the drive to centennial and you won't be disappointed!!!",

I'm assuming this place is fairly new since none of us have ever heard of it before.   Anyways, the restaurant is pretty small. Tables on one side and a \"bar\" on the other. This place has more of a lunch feel to it rather than dinner type place. Despite the seating situation, we didn't wait that long for a table.   The black garlic ramen is what immediately caught my attention, so I tried that. The broth was surprisingly better than what I anticipated. The only problem was that they are skimpy on the meat and the egg is only soft boiled (not even marinated). I think they only serve thin ramen noodles as well (I prefer thick but oh well). Anyways this place is a solid 4/5 in my opinion. I would still come back for a quick bite here and there, but this place definitely is not comparable to Jinya.",

So far, I've had the Popcorn Shrimp, Brussel Sprouts Tempura, Miso Ramen, and Creamy Tonkotsu Ramen.  On the first visit, the Miso Ramen's chashu was perfect, tender and flavorful.  Yesterday's visit when I had the Creamy Tonkotsu Ramen, the chashu was thin and tough, so that was disappointing.  The Popcorn Shrimp is a generous portion and has a little kick to it, but not too spicy.  I also liked the Brussel Sprouts tempura appetizer, crispy but not greasy.  The service has been very attentive on both visits.  I can see myself coming back again, just hoping that yesterday's chashu experience was a fluke.",

    "text": "First off, their ramen is DELICIOUS. Especially the broth. Honestly one of my favorite ramen places ever and the only reason why I'm giving no less than 3 stars.  Unfortunately, I can't give them 5 stars despite how delicious their food is because honestly, the service is horrible. Now I don't know how long they've been open (maybe their staff isn't fully trained yet) or if we just happen to come by on a really bad day for them, but this was my experience last month:  First, we were not greeted. There was a stand with a piece of paper and pen with names written down so we just went up and added ourselves on to it. The greeter eventually came back for a minute before wondering off and doing nothing.  Second, there was a wait. For us, we waited about 30 minutes before we were seated (a party before us actually left because they were waiting for so long). With no greeter or any idea of how long the wait was, we almost caved into sitting at the bar that faces the wall.  Third, our waiter was not on top of it. Watched him go to one table twice before he even got around to our table or the party that was seated right before us. Waited about 10 minutes before we even got to order our drinks. He actually forgot my drink so I had to remind him after receiving our appetizers.  Fourth, after we were done eating, we sat. And sat. Just sat there with empty bowls in front of us for quite some time before we were given the check. You think considering how busy it was, he would have tried to get us up and out sooner?   During my constant periods of waiting, I could do nothing but watch the staff in chaos and shake my head at how unorganized everything was.  Despite all this, I still very much enjoy their food so when I do have my ramen craving, I order delivery. Have never had any problems with my delivery orders and everything still tastes amazing in the comfort of my own home where the only waiting I do is wait for my food to arrive.",

Their menu is good and relatively inexpensive. One thing that is weird to me is their few choices for drinks. This is one of the few Asian places I've been to that doesn't brew their own tea for iced tea. The oolong tea is good but the can is barely enough to last you through your meal.  We came here a lot over the winter and it has always been busy. Seems to have slowed down there a little since it's been so hot. I recommend this place to everyone I know in the area who enjoys ramen",

Sushi was also ok, nothing to special about it. I want to try this place one more time and eat there and see if my opinion changes.

There's a small waiting area for about 5-7 people, depending on how close they sit by each other. If you don't want to sit in a booth or table, there's a \"counter\" section for a party of one/two. Our wait time was about 15 minutes. We ordered the miso ramen, chicken ramen, crunchy roll and california roll. You save about a dollar each if you order a bowl and roll together. For dessert we had the green tea and mango cheesecake. The food portion was pretty fair for the price you pay. Our food was pretty much tasty and good and we left pretty satisfied and full. Customer service was great! Kevin, our waiter was polite and very friendly and took the time to explain the menu to us as it was our first time there. I would recommend people to come and try this place and would definitely come back and explore other foods in the menu.",

Instead they placed us 5 adults and 2 infants in one table for 4. My brother in law decided not to order anymore because he didn't have a place to sit in, instead he just got up and took my nephew for a walk. We could hardly enjoy our food but their food is not bad. We were hungry and in a rush to leave because we felt uncomfortable. Just a heads up, if you're planning to come with a baby in a car seat or stroller you will not enjoy your time because the place have no space - just like what happened to us today.",

The service is great, my only complaint is that the location is tiny, a long skinny floor for seating. The capacity limit is very small, and during lunch or dinner rush there is a line out the door. If you want something fun and new, and it isn't peak operating times stop in. If you have a large party it'll be hard to sit everyone together and you may have to be split up to accommodate everyone in your party. If you are coming in alone or just with a friend, you can probably find seating at the bar!",

I got the Creamy Tonkatsu ramen with mild spice, and I can definitely say that I'll come back for it soon. My friends tried the Black Garlic ramen (if I remember correctly) and it was so much lighter than other places that have a similar type.

Noodles were fine as well as most of the other ingredients, but the broth definitely needs work. As well as the pork slices, which were thin and  chewy.    The Agedashi, OTOH, was not good at all. Unlike any I have had, it was heavily battered, which might have been ok had the coating been fully cooked. Yecch. Skimpy sauce and no bonito at all - hardly Agedashi! A friend who has been here 4-5 times said he had previously ordered several of the appetizers (but not the Agedashi) and they were consistently sub-par.  Staff was super friendly and attentive enough. No complaint on that end. If they get the broth and the appetizers dialed, could be really good. Fingers crossed 'cuz it'd be nice to have a decent Ramen spot on the North side of Vegas.",

Their restaurant is small, & there's not very much seating so on a busy day the wait can be long.   I have had their spicy miso ramen & their spicy, creamy tonkatsu ramen. Both were definitely delicious, but I wish there was more! The reason why I didn't give them full five stars is because their serving sizes aren't as big as I would like them to be compared to what I usually pay for in Chinatown, and they have a small dining area -- which is why I usually opt to eat at home.   It's worth trying out if you're looking to explore new ramen restaurants.",

    "text": "Nice greeting as we walked in and rapid ordering and food service. We ordered the miso ramen, chicken and curry--all were tasty but on the saltier side. The kimchy rice had great flavor though not spicy, its white kimchi, not red but again great flavor. On the negative side our waiter never asked how our food was and when we asked someone else for a to-go box she seemed offended, uttered somethin... bothered that she had to help us.   I was treated to lunch so not sure the total of everything but the menu prices were fair, not overpriced or underpriced. Avg was $10 I believe and the bowls are very large, full of noodles. I would consider going back if there weren't other options in the area to try.",

I ordered the Miso Ramen bowl mild. My boyfriend got the Chicken Ramen bowl mild. You choose from original, mild or spicy. Both dishes were very very good! We just stuck with water, which I'm glad we did! We also order pot stickers. It has 4 of them with a side of soy sauce. Our total was $24. Which wasn't bad at all! I got super full! I went around 1pm on a Sunday. Food honestly didn't take long, from ordering it then it cooking then it being brought put to us was a total of 25 minuets? I just know that by the time we left it was only 2:15pm. I love this place and will continue to go here!",

The decor is very cool and hip. Unlike a traditional American restaurant [booth or a table with chairs] you are seated at a bench table with bench seating. Or you can be seated against this corner where you are on bar stools similar to a diner. I prefer prefer the tables though.  Everytime I've come the server immediately greeted me and brought out water for the table. The water is stored in this cool little wine bottle thing, I wish I took a picture.   The menu has various ramen styles. I usually go for the miso or the regular tonkotsu. You can add extras for a little more $$$. I usually like adding an extra egg and nori [seaweed] to mine   The apperizers are good. My GF likes the gyoza and I liked the takoyaki. They have limited sushi options too such as your classic California roll.",

    "text": "Ramen was average. Steamed tofu add-on was tough, not sure what tofu it was but soft tofu would be better for the soup as well as taste-wise since it's sweeter. There was too much texture from the curds. Gyoza was definitely rushed and undercooked. There was no crisp from pan-searing it, unless it was steamed... which would not be how traditional Japanese Gyoza is made; felt very soggy in the mouth. The rice in the Crispy Rice and Tuna wasn't a pleasant crisp. It tasted more like you were chewing seeds than a fluffy grain. Food experience was my main point of criticism, wouldn't say I'd preach about it. On the other hand, definitely a small restaurant, so if you go, plan on a wait since they only have about nice tables. They play upbeat K-Pop music which makes the atmosphere more lively. Not on my list to revisit anytime soon.",

So after going there so many times during day time and early nights , we decided to go little later but the place was still opened and they were still serving .   The two asian girls working that shift were super rude and were acting like its their first night serving . They kept questioning what we are ordering like we are from mars knowing that it is our 6th time there and we get the same thing every time .   However , no one was able to give me their names and they were rude with other employees and giving them looks about saying their names .  There are so many ramen places all over the city that can serve way better costumer service so i really don't recommend this place and specially at night time !!!!!! Stay away if u wanna stay calm !  They will piss u off and get u mad and irritated by the way they act as managers and servers .  Again this applies on night time shift !!!!!",

Food is always delicious!! Depending on what time you go you'll either get seated right away or have to wait (the longest I've waited was 20 mins with 8 people ahead of me.) You have the option to sit at a booth, a table, or the bar. This place is definitely on the smaller side but it's still nice, I'd recommend bringing somebody with you to talk to while you eat or so, the servers don't have time to really talk to you as they are always busy.",

I'm so disappointed. And for the first time I order the chicken karaage, but the karaage is not what I expected so I ask the Korean server if that is their karaage. Their karaage is look like a popcorn chicken, too small almost like a drip of batter. So I ask her to make or order me a new one. Then she throw the plate in the kitchen and I heard it cuz we're sitting beside the kitchen and the register. I am so disappointed with the server and the food taste. Change a lot in a bad way. They better change their chicken karaage name to popcorn chicken. I think they don't know what is CHICKEN KARAAGE Japanese style. Or maybe that's a KOREAN CHICKEN KARAAGE STYLE. Lol....I'm NOT GOING BACK IN THIS RAMEN PLACE.",

And the tempura veggies in it got soggy right away so it just tasted like wet, soggy, breaded veggies in my ramen.  I did have leftovers, so I ended up adding to it to make the broth taste yummier!  Besides the ramen, we did order the Tempura with veggies only!  That was good.  We also ordered the Shishito Peppers.  We didn't know until it came out that it had Fish Flakes.  I had to ask what it was when it arrived and then requested another without.   They were good!  Also, I noticed they had slippery floors while on my way to the bathroom.  They have polished marble tiles, which made it riskier to walk on while greasy.  Be careful folks!  Altogether, I'd probably go back if it was somebody else's idea.  But I still think Jinya is better!",

My most recent trip was pick up. I ordered extra soup and when I got home I realized the entire bowl had spilled out. First thought maybe the lid wasn't on correctly but looking closer I found a small cut on the bottom of the bowl.. super disappointed.   Original review: 5stars for food. The ramen was very good! Kevin was my server and he was super nice.  Why 3 stars? It was just me so I sat at the bar to avoid a wait and there were two things: Every time the door opened the air would come in and it's freezing, so I'm sure it'll be hot in the summer..  Second the bar stools were SOOOOOO uncomfortable! Seriously, horrible. I sat down and there was no stability at all. It took me 2 mins to \"kinda\" get situated. Then tried again by getting up and pulling he chair in, it was a disaster. Then the ladies sitting next to me commented that they had he same issue. Then a party of 2 girls came in and one was like \"omg, I'm gunna fall.\" THEN a guy sat directly next to me and did he exact same thing I did, trying to adjust his seat a million times. Even while I was eating it just didn't feel right.",

    "text": "Ramen?!?  Did someone mention RAMEN?!?  While in town visiting my daughter, I spotted a new ramen place near the Centennial Walmart, so I wasted no time and made a beeline for their door, dragging my daughter behind me. Unfortunately, the wait time was more than 45 mins the first time we tried, so we ventured back after lunch hours another day.  SCORE!  No line and we were seated immediately.  Our waitress dropped off menus and took our drink orders.  My daughter has celiac disease, so when we inquired about the gluten content of some of their items, she was kind enough to chat with the chef to ensure a selection that would meet her needs.  Unfortunately, this restaurant is NOT gluten friendly and has an extremely limited number of items that are gluten free.  She opted for the spicy tuna roll and edamame.  I chose the original Tonkotsu Ramen (spicy).  We also ordered crispy rice with tuna to start.  Our edamame was delivered first.  The shells were solidly green and impeccable fresh.  They had been perfectly steamed (no excess water drenching the pods) and sprinkled with coarse salt.  Our crispy rice was delivered as we munched on our edamame.  Mildly spicy tuna sat atop rice squares that had been fried until crispy, and then each piece was topped with a jalapeno slice.  Normally the dish is drizzled with eel sauce and chipotle mayo, but we asked to have the sauce on the side so my daughter could enjoy it.  Very nice dish, and the rice was perfectly chewy.  My ramen and my daughter's sushi roll was delivered shortly after we finished our appetizers.  My ramen was steaming hot and colored with a light orange hue indicating they had, indeed, added the spice I'd requested.  The broth was flavorful,  as were the accompaniments (Pork, soft boiled egg, veggies).  Was it the best ramen I've ever tried?  No.  Was it good?  Yes.  Would I return? You bet!  Good prices and good service guarantee I'll stop by next time I'm in town, because after 46 years in Vegas, you can take the girl out of Vegas, but you can't take Vegas out of the girl!  I'll be back!",

I heard some of my friends love this place, and one of my friend says the ramen is salty.  The place is moderately small compare to the other ramen shops. It was a nice experience visiting Ichi Ramen. I wouldn't mind going again. They were playing K-pop songs, some bringing back memories from my high school days~",

    "text": "A great ramen spot for the area! The food and service are great.  We arrived for an early dinner and only had a short wait for a table, but the line definitely grew as we dined. The dining room has less than a dozen tables and bar style seating as well. Take-out appeared to be a large part of their business as well.  To start the meal we shared Gyoza, Edamame, and Crispy Rice with Tuna. The Gyoza was tender with a nicely flavored filling. Edamame was soft and had the right amount of salt topping. The Crispy Rice with Tuna had more sauces than usually on this type of dish, but overall was good. It probably would have been better without so much sauce though.  My main entree was the Creamy Tonkotsu Ramen. This was delicious, especially the broth. I loved every individual ingredient as well as the overall flavor. The pork slices were thin which made it much easier to eat. My friend ordered the Classic Tonkotsu Ramen which I tasted and I loved the broth on this one as well.I really didn't have a favorite between the two because they were both great. The spice for both was served on the side so spice level could be added at the table. My friend did the combination option which added a salad and the gyoza to his meal. The salad dressing for his salad was amazing. It tasted like a great combination of ginger and garlic.  Our service was attentive and no time was wasted getting our orders in. The pricing was the real standout here. For two of us to have ramen and starters we left for around $40. I thought for sure that they forgot to charge me for something when I saw the total. Nope, the pricing really is that great.",

We came in and it was jam packed but we got our name on the list and were taken care of by Kevin and our actual waiter Keenan. Keenan was super nice and kept up with our sass and sarcasm all while waiting on us attentively. He definitely didn't fall into that monotony of a typical waiter. Both super sweet guys! The ramen was good but Keenan made this review 5 stars!",

So the to-go classic tonkatsu ramen spicy was impressive, broth was piping hot 4 slices of chashu and plenty of green onions and sprouts. So impressed we said hey let's go there and I bet it will be so good.  Next day... I order a ramen spicy combination plate comes with a side salad, and your choice of goyza, varieties of sushi or fried rice. I ordered a classic tonkatsu ramen with extra green onion (extra charge) and a spicy tuna roll.  Sushi roll comes out. Very good portion. Then the ramen came in to play. 2 small slices of chasu....The broth was warm It was not hot at all. Which was odd too me, so I let it pass. Broth was tasty and spicy. The green onion was barely there :(. Noodles are a little too thick in my opinion but good and half a plain boiled egg. Half way thru the meal I was thinking did I order this correctly because I didn't receive our side salad, then I asked and our waiter said oh yeah you ordered the combo. I rather get the food Togo if that's where I'm gonna get the quality. I'm still going to visit here and hope that they work out the kinks and hope that I came on a bad night.",

I don't know what those other people ate but the chicken ramen we had was quite possibly the worst food I've ever had in a restaurant.  Specifically, the soup base was so salty that after one or two spoonsful I couldn't take it any more.  Since I'd paid good money for this, I felt I should at least eat the solid stuff.  After a bottle and a half of water to wash it down, I finished the solid stuff and then went home and drank some orange juice to get the salt taste out of my mouth.  Speaking of the solid stuff, what my $8.95 bought was two slices of chicken breast 1/8\" thick, half a boiled egg and some noodles.  They must get about six bowls of soup out of each chicken breast.  With so little content, even if this soup had been delicious, I would have been better off to go to Teriyaki Madness nearby for a MUCH better value.  Better yet, I could have gone to about any Vietnamese place for a bowl of pho that wouldn't give me high blood pressure from all the salt.",

I tried to give it 4.5 stars but apparently I'm inept.  The only reason I docked them is because the service was a tad slow.  However, he later explained they just opened a week ago and were not prepared for the volume they were receiving.  Totally understandable, and we are so happy they are doing well already and that we have a dope ramen joint in the NW.  We had the Takoyaki (soooo good) Chicken Karaage, Shoyu Ramen and I had the Black Garlic.  I can't decide which was better honestly.  The quality was worth the wait, the ambiance was perfect.  The place was a little small and they had a long line but worth the wait.  Due to the wait, I don't suggest going there starving.  However, we left SUPER full and SUPER satisfied!!!  Can't wait to go back.  Keep up the good work!  Prices are reasonable as well!!!",

The young hostess was very nice and informed us it was going to be about 20 minutes or less to get seated. The wait ended up being 10 minutes. When I sat down I was greeted immediately by the server, who happened to be the hostess as well! Talk about multi-tasking! Anyways, ordered drinks and placed my order after she came back with our drinks. I ordered the Black Garlic Ramen for me and for my daughter, the chicken karaage. Food came out quick. The Black Garlic Ramen was amazing! The garlic chips and garlic oil they put in, really gives it that awesome kick ass flavor. My daughter also enjoyed her chicken karaage. The karaage was perfect for her. A bit on the small size, but for a kid it was perfect. Not only was the food great and met me and my daughter's expectations, service was also great! Kudos to the girl that was hosting, serving, and bussing, she was kicking ass! I will definitely be back to try the rest of their ramen!",

I'd been researching Ichi ramen for about a week before actually coming in reviews were decent enough. So I came in on lunch break and was instantly greeted in Japanese I might add(I just love restaurants that do that idk why lol) my waiter was very friendly terribly sorry I can't remember his name for the life of me. Anyways he was friendly and very knowledgeable and helped me decided which ramen to get. I ordered the spicy miso ramen with extra chasu. It was made and brought out to me a lot quicker than I expected. As soon as I took the first bite I fell in love! Most places I've been to the miso ramen is super salty! But ichi was just the right amount of salt I must've inhaled that bowl in less that 5 minutes it was so good. I love that they gave me a bottle of chilled filtered water to drink on the side as well as what I ordered to drink nice touch. Not a lot of places in Vegas have good water. It's also very inexpensive after all was said and done I spent about $13. End consensus I will be returning on my breaks to try out there other styles of ramen and some sushi. Arigato Ichi Ramen!",

They were fully staffed and we were quickly seated, and our waiter too our drink order right away. Another server brought us waters over with a cute bottle that was only half emptied when we filled our glasses, which was a nice touch. We quickly decided what we wanted, orderin an appetizer of Agadashi (deep fried tofu) and then a California Roll & Chashu Fried Rice for my son and a Curry Ramen bowl for myself.  They were very accommodating to my changing my ramen order, substituting fried tofu for the katsu pork. The food was fantastic, and came out quickly. The servers kept checking back asking if we needed anything, and clearing the table in a very timely fashion. If there was any complaint, it was that the soda my son ordered was in a can and over priced for that, and that my hot tea was a Lipton Green Tea Bag just dropped in a cup. No hot water refills, no soda refills.  Given that I'd still give this place a 9 out of 10!",

Upon walking in an employee told us that we could all be seated at the bar and have the whole bar bench to ourselves. She sat us down, put out menus, napkins, straws and glasses of water (10 sets mind you). Then more people start to come in, the manager tells them to sign in on a list of some sort (a list which we were not informed we had to sign). Then the manager says that everyone else has to be seated and served before we can be served even though we were there FIRST and ALREADY SEATED. We tried to tell the manager this and he didn't care and told us to leave our seats and wait OUTSIDE. I politely asked for the general managers number (as this was unacceptable) to which he very very rudely replied \"I am the manager, this is my number, you can call me right now if you'd like\" very sarcastic and rude to a customer with a party of 10 that would have brought you lots of money for the night. Just think 10 dollars per bowl, 10 customers, not including appetizers and or sides it's easily already 100+ dollars not including a tip that we would leave. So to be treated this way in such a rude manner with no regard for customer needs or satisfaction is ridiculous. Especially since it was a manager that was so rude to us (the rest of the staff was nice and understanding). Would like a general managers number or something for this issue to be resolved. Will be emailing the company until this is resolved in a reasonable manner.",

The presentation of the black garlic ramen was great and the black garlic sauce was tasty but i would like mine alittle more garlicy.  the cali roll was a cali roll..  The overall decor was nice inside except for the floor can be washed more often. Still is a great option for japanese ramen. Will be back to try the others",

Upon arrival, the restaurant was fairly spaced, we were seated immediately as we didn't mind sitting at the bar. The ramen itself was okay, however, I was not a fan of the slimy texture of the noodles and the super salty broth. On the plus side, the fried rice was really good! Can't say i like it enough to come back though. If you like Monta, its worth the drive to china town.",

Kevin was our server and he was incredibly pleasant, kind, and attentive. He did an awesome job. We started with some edamame & gyoza which were delicious. I got the creamy tonkotsu ramen and my husband went with the curry ramen. Mine was delicious...that soft boiled egg is to die for, man. My husband said the curry ramen was good but that next time he'll kick the spicy ness up a little bit. We skipped dessert this time, but we'll definitely be back. Stoked to have a ramen place in our 'hood finally! I want to try the sushi next time, and I'll definitely report back!",

    "text": "We were pretty excited for a Ramen restaurant in the Centennial area but left slightly disappointed. We came in  a little after the dinner rush and the place was still fairly packed. Waters came quickly but we had to wave someone down to take our order after sitting there with the menus closed for 10 minutes. The server had said he'd be right back to take orders when he brought out the water.  Service: Poor, pretty much non existent after taking our initial order. No check ups or anything after waiting over 30 minutes for the food to come out. My water cup was empty and they did not bring water until after the food arrived. I could've used a refill during the lull. The servers don't have specific sections so we were receiving overlapping service.  Food: Ordered the Agedashi Tofu and it was bad. Instead of the traditional thin layer of crispy starch, it was deep fried in tempura batter. The ramen Miso and Garlic Oil ramen were decently portioned for the price. I like that they include half an egg and spice for no additional charge. The egg however, is not seasoned and just plain boiled.   Overall: Truly it deserves two stars but I'll be nice since they are brand new and still going through growing pains. We're still thankful for a Ramen shop near home and will be back!",

Great Ramen and (sinus) spicy as I ordered. Big portion of Ramen, nice that the broth and noodles came separate, no mushy noodles, nice touch! Were considering Chinese then were so happy we went Ichi. Takeout Sushi is not to be expected but was fresh, a little small however but worth it good clean. The pot stickers were good. Brussels sprouts could of used a little salt but were not greasy and all in all very good. The fried rice would be the only change, just bland but maybe the type ordered. Will order again, for sure. Thank You Ichi Ramen House and Grub Hub for the very fast delivery! B++ rating for the $60 price tag and portions. (Again the Ramen was plenty big). Happy this time around!",

    "text": "I wish I could give half stars because they are definitely closer to a 3.5 than they are to a 3.  Anytime I review a Ramen place I always use Monta as my frame of reference. They're seriously the king of Ramen in Vegas. This place is so close to home & i've been meaning to try it for that reason. I would appreciate not having to drive all the way to Spring Mountain in order to get my Ramen fix. The menu is pretty extensive they have more options for standard bowls than Monta. The add-ons are also less expensive. In order to get an egg you will only pay one dollar (versus $1.50 at Monta). Not to mention in most of the bowls you actually already receive your first egg and corn included. WIN ON THAT FRONT!! The broth is solid. The add ins are tasty. The only reason they don't win a four or five? The NOODLES. That is after all the whole point of the trip. These noodles are more reminiscent of the packaged ones, than of most Ramen places. Don't get me wrong. They're thick, less likely to get soggy but they're definitely not the quality being used at other places. You can tell that by just looking at the way the noodle has that little Ramen curl.  Another downside for me is that they don't have chili oil or minced garlic. I've come to appreciate those little perks because they pair nicely as a dipping sauce for GYOZA!  All in all, I'll definitely be back, but for Ramen... my overall recommendation is still the king.

It was super packed & they didn't  get to me for awhile. I already ordered in advance on the phone, but they did not get my name or number. This caused confusion with other orders and they had to ask other people what their orders were. After picking up, I noticed the soup spilled all over the bag & my car. The soup container had holes in it! :( Thankfully there was some left to eat. The ramen and broth were very good, BUT it was missing the corn which was listed to be part of the creamy tonkostu ramen. :( Corn is one of my favorite additions to ramen so that was upsetting. I will be back for sure since the food is good. They'll probably tighten up soon.   ** Update 10/16/17  Ate in the restaurant this time. Good service & great food! We went near closing time so no long waits or anything. Definitely our new go to! All ramen restaurants seem to be small. Not sure if it's supposed to be part of the ramen house experience or what? lol Wish it was bigger. Will be back for sure. Love how it's right down the street from me.",

I've been wanting to try this place for some time, and I'm glad I finally did. I had the black garlic ramen and it was delicious. It had a generous portion of noodles and the broth was not too salty. My only complaint it that it was a little light on chashu. We were seated immediately when arriving, which was around 1700 on a Thursday. It got really busy about an hour later and people were waiting in line. Give this place a try.",

Once we were seated a waitress took our drink order and informed us there was no kid options. She did mention how we could make our noodle order kid friendly which was chicken broth with noodles. The waiter that took our order seemed to be in a rush - didn't offer to explain to us the mild chicken ramen had the sauce on the side and apparently didn't take our order right - because when we did receive our order it was incorrect.  They were able to remake our order in a timely fashion. However the only thing we all agreed to enjoy was the appetizer - spicy tuna Jalapenos which unfortunately enough only came in an order of two pieces.  Was a place to try - wouldn't return or recommend.",

I was starving or else I wouldn't have ordered them as an \"app\"-that should be before my meal comes. Anyway it's a small size bowl it was hearty w noodles but only got two tiny pieces of chicken. You have to pay extra $ for chicken or more noodles. The gyoza I got was a bit soggy but at that point I didn't wana mention it bc I didn't have time to wait for another order. I got regular chicken and it's pretty bland tasting so u May wana get the spicy red sauce on the side. It's a very small restaurant only about 8 Ian seats on the side/bar counter area and maybe 6 booths. Apparently I are supposed to write your name down for waiting lists the girl next to us said no one told her. I hope they start telling people so they don't get into arguments regarding who was there first. Otherwise I'd go back but it's pretty far out of my are(20+ min from Summerlin) so I'll go if we are already in the area. Hopefully the service will be more prompt and they won't forget my food lol. Wish they had lemons bc tap water is pretty blah without it lol. Decent prices -$8.95 for ramen bowl or they've got combos. I'm used to Cali prices @$6 For a bowl but it's doable. We will go back and check it out again.",

Ramen cravers... look forward to sweaty nose beads while slurping up your ramen.  Their crunch roll was satisfying. I should've stuck to that, and maybe ordered another. I didn't think their ramen was great. Two things I enjoyed: soup broth and the soft egg. Otherwise, I'll go back to my fave ramen spot on Jones.  Have the black bottle sake super chilled!",

I just tried their new fried soft shell crab and it was delicious! The lightly breaded crunchy sweet crab sits on a bed of carrot puree. As far as ramen goes, I love the black garlic ramen. It's well rounded flavor is heightened by the bits of black garlic. It has an egg and chasu along with some crunchy veggies. The noodles are thin and not over cooked. The only negative is that it gets packed! You may have to wait a while for a seat if you go during dinner time but their takeout is just as good!",

    "text": "I really liked this place. I did have a to go order but the restaurant looked nice and comfortable. I was really impressed with the food. I had the Tomato Seafood Ramen and it was delicious and had great flavor. My only wish would be for there to be more scallops. I only had a half of one and it was a small one.  Fair amount of shrimp(they are very small though) and clams.  My sister had the chicken ramen and she really liked hers too. We also got the tempora brussel sprouts but they were very hard and I have dentures and couldn't eat them. . I will definitely be back  This is the second time I have ordered from ichi through grubhub that my order has been messed up. One time they completely forgot an item which was my sisters dinner. That was not grubhubs fault that was ichi's fault. Right now I have waited over an hour for an order and I live 3 minutes from ichi!!!!!!!    I will never order with Grubhub again.  But Ichi's food can't be beat.",

Went in last night during peek hours, so I was subject to a 20min wait but it's a relatively small place and they were PACKED.   Walking in the place was very lively and I was greeted with some Japanese saying that I believe means help or welcome. Good music playing and the interior was pretty cool.  Atmosphere - 5 stars  I ordered the classic tonkatsu and chatshu fried rice. The fried rice was good and very flavorful. The tonkatsu was reallllyyy good. It's one of the best I've had. Deep flavors, good portion, good temperature. Overall really good Food - 5 stars  Service was decent. Not terrible but I've had better. They were very busy so I'm giving them a little slack. I was taken care of but just wasn't impressed with that part.  Services - 4 stars  Overall - 5 stars and recommend this place to everyone to try at least once!",

There are not many choices to pick from in the menu and the ramen was just okay. The restaurant is very cramped and you sit uncomfortably close to other customers. The waiting area is just a tiny corner at the front of the restaurant. The only thing I liked was the service. It's unlikely that I'll return. I guess I will have to go across town to get my ramen fix.",

Having worked in F&B  for the last 25 years it's hard to sit down in a restaurants and give an unbiased opinion on any amount of money that I am spending for a meal good or bad. This is also the only place for Ramen in a 10 mile radius so we will keep coming back for now. Also I noticed the \"Owners\" sitting at the back table counting their money I thought that was very tacky get an office.",

My 10 year old son that's barely 65 lbs was able to finish his reg size miso ramen and part of his appetizer.    There was nothing special about the soup base except there wasn't enough that came with the meal.  You have an option to purchase more soup which I think is a scam.  Since the noodles were overcooked and there was little soup, it seemed like a noodle stew instead of ramen.  I wasn't impressed.   I would rather drive the distance from centennial to Spring Mountain than eat there.",

You are looking at about 8.95 at the most for a bowl, it's an AMAZING deal and the food is on point!!

This place was nice inside, they have a few booths and a few tables you can make together for a bigger party. I've realized though that all ramen places are small..   They have all the classic ramens, which my favorite is the tonkatsu ramen. You can make it spicy or not spicy. Up to you! The broth was good, it didn't feel like it was overly salty. It didn't feel like I had the taste of fat in my mouth.. I've noticed that sometimes if the broth can be filled with too much fat on the top. I don't like it when my mouth has that taste in my mouth, this ramen didn't give me that mouth feeling. Which is good. Ha! It was just enough ramen for me. They have some deals on the menu that you can buy the ramen and also get a side of california roll or gyoza along with a side salad. They have a few other options too!  When I'm needing my quick ramen fix, I will be back :)",

Started with edamame, which was the usual salty suck and snack.   Ordered the Black Garlic Ramen, which came out pretty quickly. Very very heavy on the garlic, but I'm ok with that.   I also ordered some Pork Katsu to add to my Ramen, but they burned the hell out of it, so I sent it back.   We also tried the Miso Ramen which was great, good flavor without being overbearing. Noodles for both were great.   Service was good, very friendly staff.   Note: I mixed the Black Garlic Ramen before I took the photo, it's prettier than that.",

    "text": "5/9 2nd Visit Update: I had a crazy ramen craving and couldn't get to Chinatown, so I gave this place another shot to redeem my impression last time. Well- my stars aren't changing... (brrr). I was very hungry and ordered the black garlic ramen based on other reviews here and their \"chicken\" karaage. I quote \"chicken\" because I surmise there MAY have been a scrap or two of flesh somewhere in the small pile of over-fried, greasy, thick, unsalted, tasteless clumps. They were crisp and then as you got to the center oil flavor just kept coming. I even bit experimentally into 1-2 of the larger pieces looking for meat, and only saw thick, oil-soaked batter. Got queasy. Decided to move on to the soup, which incidentally, they served to me a good 5 minutes before the appetizer, with no utensils (someone else, not my waiter, noticed I was sitting there with a bowl of hot ramen and no chopsticks and did bring a pair over with an embarrassed chuckle). First thing- the entire surface of the broth was encased in oil. I've had delicious, deeply flavorsome black garlic ramen at other places in town and it's always garlic oil DROPS floating on the surface, with fried garlic slices. This was a veritable layer of oil on top and the fried garlic and shallots? onions? in the broth were exceedingly bitter. The brother had decent flavor but tasted weak, like it was watered down. As I was sitting at the bar trying to eat, my neighbor to the right, a lady, kept exclaiming to her dining partner that her broth was \"so salty, way too salty, yes, too salty for my taste\" and finally pushed it away. My final disappointment was the noodles. They weren't the same as the ramen noodles served last time, which was the one redeeming quality of the horrible seafood ramen I ordered last visit and a point of positivity that I was looking forward to. They were white, and looked and felt like thinner rice noodles, definitely over boiled with none of the fresh bounce and chew and yellow color that I noticed last time. All in all, to say I regret spending $18 here (yes, I tipped the waiter $2 though he never checked on me once after he took my order) is an understatement and I definitely won't be back. Save your money for gas and drive to Chinatown- Ramen Sora, Monta, or even Sapporo Revolving Sushi which unexpectedly has the best black garlic broth I have tasted recently.  ............  This was literally one of the worst meals I have had in a while. I should've re-evaluated my choice to order the tomato broth seafood ramen when most Ramen places are known for their Tonkatsu, but I wanted to have something a little lighter for lunch. I also ordered their tempura appetizer which was a shrimp/ veggie combo. So... the ramen. It came looking like a jumble of noodles and vague ingredients in a liquid that smelled and looked very startlingly like Campbell's tomatoes soup. Not nicely laid out with ingredients on top, and I could see chunks of raw onion, which was not listed on the ingredients. I poked into it, and a sweet-tomato-seafood smell wafted up. I don't know what I was expecting, but the sweet, super salty, almost ketchupy taste was not it. The ingredients were spare, but I just couldn't get over the broth. To make things worth, I had ordered extra broth like I usually do and I was completely enveloped in this sweet salty tomato soup smell. The tempura didn't fare any better- no light crispy batter here, it was heavily battered, almost like a thick beer batter, and the shrimp were tiny- the vegetables a joke (one of them was a heavily battered single green bean) and to add insult to injury, the tempura sauce was super salty as well. My 2 stars are only for the cleanliness, decent service, and texture of the noodles, which were decently springy and chewy even being the thin style of ramen noodleGiven we don't have ramen options at all in the north, in sheer desperation I may come back to try the regular tonkatsu broth / meat options, but take my word for it- steer clear of the seafood option and the tempura!",

    "text": "Came here twice just to see them in their busy vs slow time. It was an average ramen house.  During the busy weekend evening the wait time was about 30 min. Was surprised they don't really have a system to let you know when your wait time is over. There's a list you place your name on and wait to be called. Unfortunately it's so small there's no way everyone can wait there inside (it's January so it's too cold outside), but if you go wait in the car they don't take your phone number and there no buzzer so you'll just have to keep checking back.   As far as the food goes I ordered the traditional ramen combo. Pricing was great, as were the portions and the service. The salad and appetizer were average and unfortunately so was the ramen. The killer....the broth. It was watery and not very flavorful and I mean lets be real ramen without broth is just noodles.   If you live in the NW aliante and centennial areas as I do your options are pretty much this or Moko if you want ramen and don't want to go to Chinatown. I however might have to start making the drive.  Sidenote-watch the cleanliness of the glass water container they place at your table.",

All the ingredients in the bowl were very well balanced.   I only tried the black garlic ramen, but it was amazing. I dont know about other ramens, so I will definitely come again and try other ramens. I took their togo menu, the tomato seafood ramen looks delicious!

If there's one thing about this place that keeps it from getting to 4 stars, it's the service.   Let's start with the wins: the food here is consistently good. Not amazing, but good all the time. I usually get the tonkatsu or black garlic ramen and both are great. I don't know how they get the broth to be as good as it is, but it's better than other places I've had ramen. And the pork in the broth --- it's delicious. I wish they made sandwiches with that pork. And like I said before, I think the prices are fair. During our last dinner there, we spent $35 (including tip) for two people.   My only hesitation about coming to this place is sometimes we've come here and the service has been 10/10. Other times I've come here and the service has been 6/10. During our last visit, for example, we had to wait a little longer to get refills on our drinks than I would've liked. And when it came time to get the bill, that also took a little longer. Nothing to really complain about, but enough that I think this is an opportunity for improvement.   Will I return here? For sure. Food is good and it does not break the bank and service is A-OK. Three stars all the way.",

We had been to Sapporo revolving sushi and had the ramen there so had an idea what we were in for but we were surprised at how good the ramen was here. Since it was our first time we did a little tasting to try a bit of everything. First we ordered the tempura basket which has 5 veggies and 3 shrimp (5.95) It was cooked really well and had the standard fare, onion, sweet potato, carrot, zucchini, etc. Next I ordered the shishito peppers (3.95) but was told they were out of them. We ordered the crispy rice tuna (6.95) and the fried rice (4.95). The crispy rice tuna was excellent. Cooked perfectly and the sauce was yummy. The fried rice was enough for two with some left over. Very tasty and fresh. So much better than the typical stuff you get at a Chinese restaurant.   For ramen I had the black garlic (8.95) with added butter and corn (.75 each) and my wife got the miso ramen (8.95). Both were excellent. I usually get a bowl of the black garlic ramen at sopporo but this was much better. The noodles were fresh and it was really good. Wife loved the miso as well.    Service was quick even though place was jammed. Loved it and will be back.",

We were greeted promptly, there wasn't too much interaction between us and the server but she was kind. The menu seems a bit limited but I didn't order ramen so maybe that's why. I got the signature ichi roll (very good) and popcorn shrimp which was very crunchy with a creamy sauce on top. My husband ordered the fried stuffed jalapeno and shrimp fried rice which was pretty crunchy but not bad. All of our food was $25 and they do military discount. It's decorated nicely inside and clean. I didn't like how straws are automatically given as well as ginger and wasabi- it's all very wasteful in my opinion. Overall not a bad spot for a lunch date but not good for a romantic date because it's pretty loud.",

    "text": "That was quick.  Located across the Walmart plaza, my wife and I have been eyeing Ichi since it opened. It's soup weather today, so we finally made it, after how many years lol.  It's small. 5 booths and 3 tables and a wall bar. So comfortably they can seat about 52 people. With that said, we had about a 10 to 15 minute wait from when we walked in. When seated we we're handed our menus and left with 2 glasses of water and a pitcher. Uh oh, I sense laziness. Despite having to already wait for a table, we had another 10 min wait to order. No intro, is this your first time, have you tried ramen before, or invitation to try anything special on their menu. In fact no customer service at all. \"Are you ready to order?\" Was the extent of their courtesy.   What ordered: Creamy Tonkotsu ramen Black Garlic Ramen Takoyaki  Despite the long wait to sit and order, soup came out quick. I went with a safe soup today just to get a feel of how they do their layers, and the Creamy Tonkotsu was a safe choice. Minus the corn, this dish was made pretty good. Shy on thier chasu compared to other Ramen places, but the broth was rich. Maybe a little too rich and the butter was a bit much. Otherwise tasty. On the other hand, the Black Garlic was way overwhelming for me. Take in consideration, I said for me. My wife, a garlic lover, says it was alright. Like the Creamy Tonkotsu, shy on the meat, but rich in roasted garlic flavor.   All in all, it's an ok spot. We'll have to make more trips here to sample through the menu. Why the 2 stars? Customer service is lacking. Some work in that department can help. The price we paid for the ramen could have been used at KBB.  Take your chance, your experience may be different. Just not our flavor.",

I ordered the Black Garlic Ramen combo with gyoza (the combo also included a tiny bowl of toss salad). My husband got the Curry Ramen. My kids got the Shoyu and Miso ramen.   Oh...Em...Gee!!! The broths of all the ramens were so tasty!!! It wasn't bland and oily tasting like some other places are. The ramens came with the standard of bean sprouts, pork, bamboo shoots, hard boiled egg and green onions.   The portions are just enough!  I never had a chance to try the gyoza cause my kids whacked them all before I was able to eat any. I guess, you snooze, you lose right!   I would definitely recommend this place and we would definitely be going back!!!",

Took a min to be seated almost left actually,  But we were running late for our movie so we stayed.  We ordered crunchy spicy tuna rolls and gyoza for our apps, I ordered Mizo Ramen and she got black garlic tonkotsu ramen for our main course.   Just gonna review what I ate: GYOZA- the flavor was good, They could've cooked it a bit longer mine was too soft.  MIZO RAMEN- This was good, the flavor was on point and I really enjoyed all of the ingredients.   OVERALL- I enjoyed the experience, the staff was good the food was ok, and it really hit the spot for a quick ramen stop on a late date nite.   Keep up the good work Ichi Ramen!",

We all fully enjoyed each of our choices! Great service and staff. We did try to go once at night and it was really busy so we went again for lunch. It was still pretty busy, but we got sat right away. Definitely will become a regular! I saw take out orders waiting so very excited about that as well! Great new addition to the Centennial area!",

    "text": "Came here for a ramen fix with my husband. Nice that is super close to our house. We came in right when they opened so no wait. Our food came quickly as well. My husband had the garlic ramen and I had the miso ramen. Both were really good. Nice and hot which I like. The portions were very small compared to other ramen places we've been to. They do have an option for extra broth which is $2 more and another option for extra noodles which is also another $2. So an extra $4 if you want more I guess. That would make it about a $12 Bowl and that's not including other add ons you might want. Seems kind of pricy for the amount you get, but it was tasty. We ate every last drop of our bowls cause they were so small & We left hungry Maybe make the portions just a little bit more larger or even have a option for a small, medium or large bowl and or make the add ons a little more cheaper. We would come back. Hopefully the portions will be bigger by that time",

Chicken ramen soup was tasty and good.  Chashu tasted bland, and its texture was a bit firm compared to what you get at, say, Monta.  Gyoza was just OK.  Grade D for seating comfort:  we sat in a booth and found the seat to be unusually uncomfortable.  Perhaps it's too deep.  Maybe the counter chairs are more comfortable.  We wanted to eat fast and get up.  Maybe it's intended to be somewhat uncomfortable to speed up turnover.  The restaurant was packed on a Tuesday night around 5:30.  I suppose that's a good sign.",

It was really nice inside, and we got there 5 minutes after they opened at 11:35. We ordered Agedashi Tofu and I got the Vegetarian Ramen and my boyfriend got the black garlic ramen. At 12:20 we still hadn't even gotten our appetizer. After 45 minutes, our appetizer showed up and my boyfriend's ramen did too. I waited another 20 minutes for my ramen to come, to taste it and find that the ramen wasn't cooked fully, and everything in the ramen was mush. Our waitress didn't use her electronic order pad like she was supposed to so we ended up waiting for our food forever. I waited 1 hour and 10 minutes for ramen. Also, our waitress was screaming at the other workers. Needless to say, this place was horrible. I would really recommend going elsewhere. At least I didn't have to pay for my undercooked ramen...",

Took no longer than 15 min to get seated (noon on a Sunday), got our orders in less than 3 min. Food came out maybe 5 min after ordering. It's a busy ramen house so don't expect small talk and chit chat from your wait staff (which is the case in Japan. There's no small talk in a real ramen house lol). It's a small narrow restaurant so I would say no large groups. They have the capability to put some tables together. Just be careful of doing groups during busy hours.  All in all I'll be going back. Happy with the service, experience, and food",

We walked in and was a little confused because no one greeted us welcome.  We figured out that you have to sign in on a clipboard by the counter.  About 10 mins or so we got seated.  Menu pretty straight forward.  Decided to try the miso ramen with extra soft egg and a extra broth omg I was surprised that it was actually same size as your order.  The broth was delicious.  They have a few condiments you can use on the side if you want to make your broth spicier.  I guess it's an okay to place to go if we don't feel like driving 30 mins to our favorite ramen place.",

I've been to plenty of Ramen places (I used to go to Ramen Sora but since I live on this side of town) but this one is pretty great. Not the worlds best- but it won't disappoint.",

When we sat down the server was very respectful and nice and recommended us so choices. The reason I am giving them a one star is the fact that all of our food is cold. Our ramen was warm but people next to us had steam coming from there ramen. Second our popcorn shrimp was more like bread and there sauce there was no shrimp. This place is very inconsistent and it could be a 5 Star. What is really embarrassing is I recommended this place to a friend who happens to be a ramen lover and I was embarrassed inviting him. Another issue is the lack of spice or really anything to flavor the broth.",

I ordered edamame and the black garlic ramen combo which comes with a small salad and a side which I chose the crunch roll. Hubby got the chicken ramen combo with gyoza. We were very happy with the quality/taste of the food. I was happy to see the sizes of the soup, lots of noodles and broth! I was worried about the bad reviews that mentioned poor service and rude staff but I can honestly say their staff members were friendly and helpful. We'll be coming back for more!",

Should at least put in some carrots and grape tomatoes. Didn't even finish it. I asked for no green onion in my ramen and they ignored it and still put it in. Kudos for them making me a new one.

Haven't had any good ramen since I last visited Japan ( a year ago now)  To start to went with the tkakoyaki and Kim-chi fried rice and a hot green tea. The talk was good, not great but good for sure (kinda picky with my takoyaki). The fried rice was really good. Not too salty with a nice kimchi flavor.   For ramen, I went with the classic tonkatsu (of course). That was surprisingly good. Deep flavors in the broth. The chashu was very tender and the noodles held good flavor.   The best way to judge a ramen shop is by its tonkatsu and they hit a home run. I will be back with friends and family next time!!",

Told him I was there for a pick up order, then was handed over to another employee. These two were like night and day. She had zero personally. She seemed so unhappy to be there, as if she was forced to go to work. Fortunately, it wasn't something I had to deal since I was taking my dinner to go. I ordered a garlic ramen and shishito peppers. The one pro is the broth, super tasty. But then there's the rest. I'm no ramen expert, but I've had more than my share from all over. I respect that everyone had their own recipes, these weren't ramen noodles. They were thin, over cooked and flavorless. There was no bite or chew to them. Ran out of broth well before noodle because I had to compensate for the lack of flavor with each bite. As for the shishito peppers, they were disappointing. Sooooo mushy. Again, usually one would leave a little crunch on the pepper but these were seriously over cooked. Don't know what their deal is, but they should lower the cook time on some of their dishes.",

If you're look for fancy or fine dining, this isn't it. If you're looking for good food at reasonable prices, this place fits the bill. The shrimp appetizer is excellent.",

    "text": "I love ramen and Japanese food places. So when my wife and I stumbled upon this place I was immediately excited to go and try what they had. It's a Farley new spot and in the opposite corner of the Walmart parking lot in a subdivided building. The place is very clean and the staff is very friendly upon walking in, our waiter was Kevin and he wasn't the type to keep bugging you while you have food all in your mouth, but would make sure we are good. The menu is easy to navigate with just the right amount of choice to satisfy any palate.  I ordered the curry ramen, while my wife had the Tonkotsu ramen; we also ordered agedashi tofu, and spicy tube roll to share. I must say, this spot might be on my favorite ramen joint list. I know for sure I'm coming back to eat this tasty food. The chefs here know how to make a good ramen without overly seasoning the soup base. So far I am just loving this spot, with the whole atmosphere and everything.  Ohh and how could I forget, Kevin blessed us before we left with a $5 off card for next time which sweetens this place up more, not that it needs it. So if your looking for a bomb ramen spot out in the North west side try it and you will not regret that decision.",

Best kimchi fried rice I ever had here in Vegas so far was at 'Other Mama'. Pricey but worth it!  *just noticed that the menu pricing was different from what I actually paid! I paid nearly $2 more for the kimchi fried rice than what is listed on the menu! I'm so confused!!",

    "text": "Probably the best ramen place in Vegas right now. Friendly atmosphere, and the staff starts to recognize you.  First off, Vegas has horrible water, we all know that. Ramen is only as good as the water it is made in. They filter their water and not just for prep but you also get a glass bottle of chilled filtered water for the table. I couldn't count how many restaurants I've been to in Vegas that have absolutely disgusting water. Immediately turns me off from ever coming back.  Ichi Ramen has enough variety, it is low cost, and the portions are quite large. Getting two ramen with one being a combo is usually enough for two people. I also like that they give the spice on the side so you can make it as spicy or mild as you want.  The place is small, so they are short on seating. The place is also extremely popular so expect a wait during dinner time. The food comes out very fast on most days so the customer turnover is pretty good.  Their 'front desk' is actually back in the restaurant with a sign-in sheet up front. I can see how this confuses some patrons that aren't used to it. This is a very common method for seating at this type of restaurant. Go to LA and they all do it as they all have waits. They should probably have one staff member be more proactive in managing the wait list as I have seen plenty of people walk in and just stand around looking confused. Maybe better signage would help.  We've been going almost weekly for the past year.",

The restaurant is cramped and the draft when someone opens the door was horrible. The whole restaurant shook. I will come back as the food was good, location is convenient and I think they are improving or at least want to improve",

The only thing I wasn't as thrilled with was the pork chasu was cold. And it wasn't as tender as I was hoping. Otherwise, the miso broth is pretty good. The beers are cheap, the food is cheap, and it's a nice place to warm up with a bowl of ramen. They have a pretty decent selection as well.

    "text": "Craved ramen earlier today and decided to try them out since its only 10 mins from home. Waited for almost 20 mins to get a table for 2 and a baby. Place is super small and a bit cramped. Finally got a table and within a minute, we knew what to order. Waited again nearly 15 minutes, no water, no water, no order, no service at all! I can hold only so much patience. So guess what, we decided to leave.   I truly understand they just opened but hey these staff must be trained properly. Smile, be aggressive! While waiting, I've observed almost every little thing. You got a guest that's been waiting for his check at the bar area since we were waiting to be seated. Dirty dishes at the bar counter left for nearly 25 mins.Two servers served the same table while the three tables that they've sat are waiting to be serviced. The 3rd staff member is arranging the take out orders. Why not one take care of the order, the other runs the food, and the other cashier/to go orders. But instead, two of them were doing the same and no one took any orders. I wonder if they even noticed we left. Even to give us water to start while we looked at the menu. Nope that didn't happen.   Ramen joints are usually quick because I've been to several and they are fast. Service are top notch too. All the broths and toppings are pretty much prepped. It's a matter of just putting it together. They need to get themselves organized and situated or it's gonna be a problem. We are all customers/guests so as a restaurant worker, it's pretty much common sense on how to provide service. We all eat out somewhere so we pretty much know what's expected. It's a step by step process. From reviewers photos, their ramen sure looked good but sorry, lost an opportunity. So all I have is a one star, there is no ZERO lol!",

    "text": "Weird how when I was craving ramen since it's been a little chilly that by some divine miracle a ramen spot is open 10 mins away from me.   Ichi is tucked away in this new addition of Centennial where a lot of restaurants are opening (Wahoos and Rolled Ice Cream!).   So Ichi is a good spot, great interior & expansive menu with plenty of options. Ramen was good - flavor was there, but I will say that I'm a little disappointed with the portion. I felt a little skimped out on the broth. Now these bowls can be a little tricky since they look deep, but since I ordered extra chasu  it really seemed like there wasn't enough broth left in the bowl for me to enjoy .   As far as service goes, it was very average. You guys just opened - please seem motivated and happy that you have customers coming in for lunch! Will I come back? Sure, there's plenty on the menu I would love to try. Hope you take this and improve in the next coming weeks!",

We ordered all of the standard things that you would expect at a Ramen house. Gyoza, edamame, fried rice and yes the quintessential Ramen. All of the food was at best lackluster,  with no flavor and portion sizes were minuscule in comparison to some other Ramen shops that we have frequented here in the Las Vegas Valley. In my opinion this is the place that you do not have to frequent. Save your money!",

I wonder if they've ever eaten at an actual ramen spot, or if they're comparing it to actual TopRamen. This is the most mediocre ramen I have ever had, and it only has gotten progressively worse. Because it's in centennial (the only shop around) they are always busy, the staff is slow to clear tables/ serve, and honestly look like they would all rather talk in a huddle amongst themselves. Quality of meat is awful, miso both is bland, asking for spicy does nothing and to top it off it's priced than most ramen shops in Chinatown. To summarize: not worth it, a bummer, staff is lack luster, save your money and go elsewhere.",

Place is small like many ramen houses, but service was rather quick and the wait wasn't bad either (about 10 min). We tried the shoyu and the chicken ramen, both spicy. Spicy level wasn't spicy at all for us and my husband isn't too big on spicy food. From a scale of 1-10 I'd say the spicy was maybe a 5 at most? Overall the ramen tasted great but the shoyu broth was a bit too salty for my liking.   During this trip, we also tried the crispy rice with tuna and the crunch roll. Honestly, these were my favorite and definitely something that I will be ordering in the future. Looking forward to trying other things on the menu next visit.  I recommend this place if you're nearby and have a craving for ramen without wanting to drive to china town.",

They have Sapporo on Draft and even a variety of flavored Soju (Korean...but delicious)...Takoyaki. When ordering \"spicy\", the level of spice is admirable considering the typically bland US palet for anything other than salt and pepper. Bravo.   Cons: The chef should be ashamed at his attempt at Tako Yaki. I should lower my expectations when ordering a Japanese street food in a brick and mortar restaurant, but omitting the Katsuobushi is a mortal sin.   Sapporo is nice, but Asahi on draft is non-negotiable.   Overall - a damn delicious place to enjoy a bowl of Ramen and more than likely the best location in the area. I just wish the establishment would make the food more authentic - which in this case would actually make it better. Japanese art would go a long way in making the atmosphere feel less sterile.",

So amazing! The noodles are cooked perfectly, the broth is flavorful, and the spicy sauce is SOOO tasty! I've come here before and got the fried brussel sprouts and those were delicious as well. I love that that they offer vegan/vegetarian options.. sure makes it easy when I am sick and need something quick and delicious!  Thank you so much Ichi Ramen! You guys are awesome!",

We said we were okay with bar seating..big mistake because their bar literally butts up against the front door. After realizing we really wouldn't be happy sitting there, we ordered our food to go. We ordered vegetarian ramen, chicken ramen, and crispy rice spicy tuna.  The vegetarian broth was decent, but literally had 3 pieces of broccoli and 2 pieces of tofu l. Kind of disappointing. The crispy rice spiny tuna was more like just crispy rice...that wasn't even crispy. I didn't try the chicken ramen so I can't speak to that. Needless to say, I won't be coming back.   Mediocre food, cramped seating..not how I want to spend an evening",

I've tried the curry ramen and the creamy tonkatsu ramen on the spicy side and they tasted superb. The basic bowls are good themselves and like other ramen places, there are sides you can add to your bowl.  They have a combo where you can order a ramen bowl, salad and a side. (I got curry rice on my side)  The staff were great and friendly, one even greeted me remembering who I was when I used to go to their sister restaurant Sweet Poke.  Waiting time is great especially for me since I go alone and both times there was plenty of space on the bar table area.  All in all I'd give this place a 5. I was pleased with everything even the location since it's close to where I live. Going to try other food on the menu next time.  Only thing I didn't like was that they keep forgetting to give me a napkin and chopsticks. Otherwise, their service won't stop me from giving a 5 :) This place is new and I'm sure they'll be more efficient with the menial stuff.",

I also really like the yelling from the kitchen, it adds a gordon ramsey touch. I'll just wrap this review up with great food and good service. I will be back",

The broth was tasteless and there was a ton of tiny black flakes in the dish. When I picked up a group of noodles they were covered in black specks. Upon further investigation we realized there was no pork in either of our dishes and bamboo or bean sprouts and it had a sprinkle of chopped green onions on top. When I asked what all the black specks were he said it was the black garlic. Hmm! When we asked about the missing pork they had the kitchen prepare it. In their defense they tried to correct the error, but the food did not taste as wonderful as it had in the past. The soup was tasteless. I asked one waitress if they had a new cook in hopes it was a learning curve, but she said no. I even told the waiter it was the worst dish I had been served here. Very disappointed!",

    "text": "Didn't feel like tacos, korean, Hawaiian or breakfast since I missed it, so ramen was the next thing on the list for a lunch option. Kudos to northwest getting a ramen house, which meant I didn't have to drive down to Chinatown haha.   As I entered through the door, I was greeted with a very unenthusiastic \"Irasshaimase!\" However,  I was seated right away towards their bar seating which was facing the wall. No complaints here since they had an electrical outlet to plug my phone to charge. Plus they had USB adapters on the outlet itself in case you forget your charger base itself. Nay to not being offered a booth or table.   Nothing stood out on the menu. They offer your typical fare: tonkotsu, shoyu and miso broth with appetizers and simple sushi.  For their house specialties, they have a seafood tomato broth ramen, black garlic tonkotsu and a curry ramen. Not wanting to suffer from double the allergy attack of the seafood+soy allergy,  I just went with the black garlic.   I can see where guests would complain that it's too salty for their liking,  but I was more concerned with how fatty the dish is with no vinegar condiments to cut through the richness like other ramen houses I've been to. Chashu pork slice portions were very skimpy.   What would be 2 or 3 whole slices at other restaurants, theirs are 2 half pieces that make up 1 slice. The soft boiled egg is only a half piece. Where's my other half? Haha. The only redeeming quality was that I preordered extra noodles. The thin straight noodle which is vey similar if not the same ones that Monta serves. Thought this while time, the initial server didn't check in on me to see how my food was, but they checked on the other two guests sitting on the bar with me. They only inquired about my food when they came to pick up my card for payment.   The decoration is geared towards a modern style. Bathrooms were clean.   Last but not least,  there really was no fond good bye it any kind of \"welcome back, \" \"come back and see us again.\" However I did hear \"good bye\" being called out to me as i was already out the door. Should be no excuse not to invite a guest back to any establishment if you wish any guests to return. Definitely no excuse to acknowledge a departing guest even if a server is busy ringing people out. Makes me wonder if i even want to return and try any of their other dishes at all when I'm on this side of town again.   Service - 3 Food - 3 Decor - 5",

I'm very picky with takoyakis since it's one of my favorite foods, but theirs wasn't bad. It's way better compared to other places. I'm a huge garlic fan so I had to order the black garlic ramen, and it did not disappoint me. If not made right, garlic can overpower the entire bowl, but it wasn't with this case. I could still taste the other flavors of the bowl.   I'm definitely coming back to try the other foods.",

Ichi is good enough but to be honest it's not as good as few ramen establishments in China Town.  I tried creamy tonkotsu ramen, miso ramen, spicy tonkotsu and tomato seafood; all of them were solid. Noddle were properly cooked with good firmness. All the soup bases tasted fine.  As for appetizers they are not as good as the noodle. I tried gyoza, fried tofu, takoyaki, and chicken karaage. I wasn't impressed with any of them. Overall service was fine no problem there. Probably should be 3.5 star rating but I'm just happy I have a decent ramen shop by my neighborhood.",

Gyoza 3/5 stars  The sauce was ok and the gyoza itself was good but was kind of bland.   Karaage chicken 5/5  One of the dishes that was very good and would recommend getting. The chicken was crispy and flavorful. I really like the dipping sauce as well!   California rolls 4/5  I don't eat seafood but my boyfriend and his daughter enjoyed them.  Pork fried rice 3/5  The pork was tasty but I did not like the flavors of the fried rice.   Ramen 3/5 (1 medium spicy and 1 regular) The broth lacked salt (badly) the noodles were tender and the pork belly was good.",

I can say that as more and more people discover this place there tends to be a little wait as the place is not very big, but always worth it. I love that you can call in your order as well.

The venue looks very modern and stylish, however the sound system playing k-pop could've been turned down a little bit.    Ordered the Tonkotsu ramen, which turned out better than I thought since I've lived in Japan for a few years and it's pretty hard to find ramen in LV where corners haven't been cut.  The authenticity was pretty good and the spiciness had enough kick to it.    The gyoza was a bit of a disappointment, as it looked frozen and didn't spend enough time to get a crispy skin.    Overall this is a nice addition to the Centennial area instead of driving all the way to spring mountain.",

I placed a takeout order for the creamy ramen and it was ready about 10 minutes later (about the time it took me to get there).  In all - I was really pleased.  The ramen was packaged to go really well.  The broth was in one container and all of the noodles, veg, and meat were in a second container.  The ONLY downside to this is that one of the containers needed to be a little larger as I couldn't fit everything into a single bowl.  I'm not even taking a star away for that, because it was really good.  The noodles had an excellent texture, the veggies were fresh and crisp, the meat was very flavorful... and they managed to package an egg to go that stayed soft-boiled.  I killed it on my own by pouring the broth over it -- but that was me.  The bowl of ramen was hot and filling.  It kept me happy all afternoon.  Even better was the price.  $8.95 plus tax.  I was very pleased - the cost was for a complete bowl of ramen and they didn't try to upcharge me for every little thing.  I will certainly be back.",

We ordered 2 combinations which include a very small salad, a side dish and a bowl of Ramen which we found to be more of a complete meal.  Definetely recommend the Black Garlic Ramen and will be back for more!",

    "text": "Sorry Monta, you've been ousted as my top Ramen spot in the city. Bold words, I know.   We've been impatiently waiting for a ramen house to grace us here in Centennial Hills, and were pleasantly surprised when we ran into Ichi - a tiny spot in the corner of a plaza up in our neck of the woods. Decor is minimal and modern, with a few booths, tables and bar seating on the left hand side.   I got the classic Tonkatsu and my husband tried the chicken - both were a slam dunk. The flavor development in the broth is nothing short of phenomenal, noodles fresh with a bite and we found the perfect amount of additions to the bowl. Nothing is worse than when extras crowd the bowl and you have to search for broth. We've been back time and time again, we've even had it delivered because we crave their delicious flavor.   So why the missing star? Service. If you're taking the food to go - the guys at the counter are top notch. If you're at a table, you'll find yourself with time to scroll your IG feed before even placing your beverage order. In our opinion, the staff is slow to serve even if they appear to be running around like crazy. I'm not sure if it's a lack of table assignment - but three people ended up asking us if we've been taken care of... it took 17 minutes for us to get drinks.   Service is something that will be worked out with time - I hope they get it figured out sooner rather than later, because Ichi has become our favorite in the city, and we want it to stick around!",

It is a small place with eight or so booths and 4 person tables.  Our servers were Drew and Kevin and they were nice guys.  There may be a  wait until you are seated with your party.  The menu is small but I urge you to order the combination plate around $13.00.  It comes with the ramen of your choice, small bowl of salad drizzled with their signature sesame dressing and a sushi roll or gyoza, your choice.  I went with their signature pork katsu curry ramen and their crunch roll drizzled with katsu sauce and Japanese mayo.   My sibling got the tonkatsu ramen with spicy tuna roll for his combo.    My girlfriend I think got the tonkatsu ramen, signature rolls, Takoyaki balls.   Takoyaki balls can use more tako in it. I think it only had one to two pieces in it. The curry ramen was pretty good, different but good. The curry is not at Zen curry but everyone has to make it their own and I was fine with that.  You can ask for their spice to add and I went a little much with two scoops.  Do only one or you will be sweating.  It went well with my crunch rolls, the salad was okay.  I tried my girlfriend's signature roll and it tasted like my crunch roll.  I can't tell a huge difference  between the two.  I tried one spicy tuna roll and it was your normal.  I tried their broth on the tonkatsu ramen and it is like the jinya ramen just their twist.  The broth was perfect as nothing needs to be added.  Why 4 instead of 5? I still like Jinya Ramen more but no way I am complaining.  The Takoyaki needs more tako in it.  I will surely be back at Ichi Ramen when I am on Centennial.",

    "text": "Ramen in the NW?!  Thank you, baby J!  To say I was excited when I saw that Ichi had opened up is an understatement. Every time I drove by it, longing would wash over me, but I would keep driving, resolving to one day stop and enjoy a bowl of delicious brothy magic. That took longer than expected but I suggested this spot to my friend for lunch this weekend and she was all for it. YES! Finally.   We got there right when they opened on a Saturday at 11:30 a.m. and there were people waiting outside already. I felt a bit territorial. I was thinking \"yo, I don`t want to have to fight someone. I come here in peace, but I`m hungry\". When they opened up the doors, we walked into a clean, modern eating area with booths on the right hand side and a bar style seating area on the left. We snagged the first booth on the right. I need space to spread out all the food and joy I derive from eating it. Bar seating just does not provide that option.  Anyway, we were brought water pretty quickly. They give you handled cups with ice and then they have a cute farmhouse type bottle with water that you can pour from. It's probably tap water, but I ain't mad at their attempt to be fancy. I see you, Ichi. We also ordered some Sapporo because what else goes well with ramen? Come on people. Get on this level. Sapporo was as expected: cold, crisp, delicious. They brought us cups with the bottles and offered to pour it a moment too late because we were already doing it. No points deducted.   Our waiter came over soon after and I cannot remember his name but he is the nice young man with braces. Okay, I just felt hella old typing that, but yes, he was friendly and attentive. We had a few menu questions and in the end I ended up ordering the chicken ramen combo with spicy tuna roll and salad. My lunch date opted for the seafood ramen with vegetarian broth. She really wanted the curry ramen but it is made with pork broth. Suggestion: Offer the curry ramen with vegetarian broth somehow and that would be a great option for folks who do not eat pork.Just sayin'. Would be a great option for the menu, but hey what do I know? Everything, clearly. Lastly, we ordered the deep fried soft shell crab because it looked amazing on the menu and our nice young man with braces waiter said it was delicious. SOLD!  My chicken ramen was amazing. I really enjoyed it. The broth was deep and complex. That is my foodie way of saying I ate it all. Seriously, the broth was really good, comforting and really hit the spot. The egg was soft boiled, which was nice. Sometimes I get an overcooked egg and I do not have time for that nonsense in my ramen. Noodles were tender but had bite. My only gripe is that there was not enough chicken, but hey I get it. Overall, filling and very satisfying. They gave me some chili sauce on the side but I didn`t use it for some reason. Next time. They give you the option of mild, medium, and spicy. The spicy tuna roll was good. I read another review that said it was too salty? I don`t think so. I thought it was perfect and it was spicy. I had to replenish my fancy bottled tap water several times. Salad was fine with a light dressing on it. Gotta get those greens' y'all.   My friend got the seafood ramen with vegetable broth as I mentioned before and while she thought it was good, there was a turn off in the fact that Ichi did not shell the shrimp. It was just messy to eat having to stick your fingers into the bowl and retrieve the shrimp to peel it. If they had peeled it, I think it would have been a lot better. Take note Ichi: peel those shrimp, please. If we wanted to peel shrimp, we would have gone to Hot N Juicy. Overall, she said the flavors were good, though.  The crowning glory? That dang deep fried soft shell crab. Look, I would marry this appetizer if that were possible. It was fall apart soft once you got beyond that initial crunch. The carrot puree at the bottom was unexpected and divine. I`ll take ten more, thanks.  Overall, a solid three stars. Good service, decent prices, happy tummy food. Just peel those shrimp and get a vegetarian curry ramen option and I would not hesitate giving more stars. I will be back.   If you like ramen and have been waiting for a place on this side of town, this is it. Enjoy.",

Dumpling  weren't seasoned well , and the broth for my ramen tasted water down.

This place is a find that I hesitate to tell people about because I really don't want anyone else to find it. There is always a wait no matter what time you go and that's because the food is so good. If you don't want to wait for a booth the wait for seats at the counter is usually shorter and that is what we did tonight. My husband has his usual miso ramen and I had the salad (a little heavy on the salad dressing so I will have to remember to tell them to put it on the side next time), gyoza and the soft shell crab which was wonderful . Now that winter is here we will be visiting more frequently.",

That yum yum sauce and Chipotle mayo tossed with the bite size fried shrimps is an awesome combination. I'm glad I had someone to share it with. We also ordered the California Roll which my daughter enjoyed. I ordered the Black Garlic Ramen which sounded great in the menu. To be honest, it smelled delicious when it was delivered and it tasted fabulous but halfway through, the flavor just got to be too much. I think this would've been great if I had shared this with my friend. The ramen was a descent sized serving for one person. Service was ok. I get it, they were busy. Location is small with only a few tables, a small bar-like seating area, so again, you may have to wait especially during prime dining hours. While we sat and dined, there was always a crowd standing and waiting to be fed. I'd definitely come back and try their other ramen options.",

    "text": "Our family spent three years in Japan, and since returning to the states, we (unfortunately, to some) have developed a relatively \"elitist\" view on Japanese cuisine. (Lucky I'm Yelp Elite, right? ...Hello? Is this mic on...?)  I wholeheartedly agree with another Yelper on here - The food here is nearly as amazing - and authentic - as the ramen we had in Japan. But I'll get to the food in a moment...  We were immediately greeted when we walked in with a hearty \"irrashaimase\" (welcome!) by a staff member, who took our name down for their list. We only waited 15 minutes at about 7 pm; not really peak but they definitely had a longer wait list by the time we left. One issue I noted was there wasn't too much sitting space for people waiting - 5, maybe 6 people squeezed on 2 benches. Yes there was room outside, but it was still windy and chilly, so inside was preferable. While you're waiting inside, there is a running video/slideshow featuring some of the food - safe to say it was enticing and definitely inspired our meal choices.  Decor was great - dark grey-toned wood paneling was very modern and trendy, which gave the place a feel of 'old world traditional ramen meets 21st century spins.' They have a combination of bar seating, booths, and 'farm-style' tables with benches. Our one table had our backs to the walkway to the kitchen, so it saw a lot of traffic. It felt a bit crowded at the tables, which were pretty much back to back, but if you were at the booths or the bar, you had a bit more room between you and the next diners.  Service: Our server, Joshua, we on POINT. He was upbeat, very positive demeanor, very professional, and enthusiastic about Ichi Ramen. He knew the menu well and provided his recommendations, which, for our first time there, we followed many of them, but I'll get to that later. He was terrific. He even had a recommendation ready for my toddler (which she loved)! Other than asking for initial silverware/chopsticks, it was like he was reading our mind. We never had to ask for a beverage refill, he was quick to clear or table of empty plates/bowls AND little garbage (wrapper for the chopsticks, wrapper for the kids chopstick helper, etc.). He seemed to know - without being pushy or rushing - when we were about done, and brought us to-go containers, followed by the check, again ALL without having to ask or even wave him down! COLOR ME IMPRESSED!  Now, the FOOD (Finally. Sorry guys, but thanks for sitting through me painting the experience for you!): * The Creamy Tonkatsu Ramen was spectacular. Great soup base, and the noodles were PERFECT. Definitely comparable to the real thing. Thick without being too chewy, and didn't get soggy, even with our letovers the next day. The toppings definitely added to the textures and flavors as well. My one issue (and this is purely subjective due to comparisons) is that the chyasu (pork) is relatively small in size and a bit dry. In Japan, we would get these size-of-your-hand, thick cuts of pork with more fat/marbling on it that lends to the meat's added tenderness and melt-in-your mouth texture. This change would definitely get tha tlast star from me. * The Deep-fried Soft Shell Crab was amazing! Great crunch, very meaty, and was accompanied by some drizzles and some kind of slightly sweet, tangy topping that added to the savory flavor. * The Gyoza wasn't too salty or greasy, and the dip that accompanied it was very complimentary. My one issue with this was that I wish it had a bit more or a crisp/crunch to the gyoza (assuming they were pan-fried) - this would have made it a perfect 10 replica to the gyoza we've had at ramen houses in Japan. * Crispy Rice with Tuna: I personally loved this! You know when you fry rice and there's that really hard, crispy part at the bottom of the pan? It's like that, with soft tuna on top, with drizzles of sauces and a sliver of jalapeno. The flavors and textures WORKED: spicy, tangy, creamy soft tuna with crispy hard rice.. This was a personal favorite! * Popcorn Shrimp: Not bad! I half pictured something from KFC or similar, but this was much more akin to 'honey glazed prawns with walnuts' from a Chinese restaurant. I can't speak to the 'authenticity' of this because I don't think I've had anything like this in Japan, but it was pretty good! I was just so full at this point that I couldn't eat too much of it, but the breading and frying was light and airy, the shrimp was cooked to perfection, and the drizzle was light and sweet - not at all overbearing.   Overall, I loved it. a few changes would easily score this a perfect 5/5 stars for me. But I absolutely plan to visit here again and I highly recommend this place to others! Thank you again to Joshua for his OUTSTANDING, above and beyond service!",

    "text": "This ramen shop filled a deep void in the Centennial part of Las Vegas, which lacked a decent ramen shop.  I've been here twice now and am ready to share my review.  Please keep in mind I am a HUGE fan of Monta Japaneses Noodle House aka Monta Ramen.  So Monta Ramen is the golden standard for ramen in Las Vegas in my opinion.   1st off Ambience:  Nice and clean atmosphere.  The music is trendy and on the loud side. So don't come here if you're looking for a quiet meal.  2nd Service:  I went on the weekend this time.  So it was busy.  No one greeted me at the door because the waitress was busy taking orders.  So I was left standing at the door along with 2 other different parties for about 5 minutes before someone could properly greet me and inform me there was a wait.  The first time I was there was a weekday, and I was greeted and seated immediately.  I recommend an area where guests can sign in on their own while waiting to be assisted.  Besides the small wait, the servers were friendly and periodically checked on how I was doing.   3rd Quality of Food: The first time I went there,  I ordered the creamy tonkotsu ramen, but felt I couldn't give a fair review by comparing a creamy tonkotsu with a classic tonkotsu.  So this time I ordered a classic tonkotsu with no additional garnishes besides what it already came with.  I got the combo this time, which came with a salad with dressing, and I chose the spicy tuna roll from the choices listed.  The dressing on the salad was absolutely delicious.  It tasted like a citrus vinaigrette dressing.  Light and crisp yet savory in flavor.  Sadly, it was probably the highlight of my meal.  The spicy tuna was your basic roll with nothing overtly memorable about it, but it was suitable for it's purpose.  Then I had the tonkotsu ramen,  which I wanted to love with all my heart since Monta Ramen is far from where I live.  The accompanying chashu was slightly charred, which gave it nice flavor.  The noodles had a nice firmness and taste to them, but the ramen broth itself lacked the depth and flavor I had grown to expect and love at Monta Ramen.   Conclusion: Would I eat here again? Yes, I would because they are close by, and it will satisfy me if I need a quick ramen fix.  But if I'm craving to eat  ramen at it's best, I will just have to make the drive out to Monta Ramen.",

After we were seated we took a look at the menu, then noticed another couple walked in and had the same experience as us, no greeting, no acknowledgement, and they left. If we weren't hungry we would have done the same. Food was good, but my experience was already unenjoyable as soon as I walked in.   Teach your workers how to greet your customers, especially when the place isn't even busy. Or put a sign up that says \"seat yourself\" because you're losing business and it's not a surprise.",

Everything was intact and the perfect temp, but I have to say that the chicken ramen wasn't as good as I've had in other places, still good, but pretty average in flavor and not a lot of actual chicken. Wouldn't stop me from ordering something else from their menu though!",

Tonight our server KYLE didn't care at all, or no customer service at all!!! Just dropped our glasses of water, took our order and that's it!!! My husband has to get more napkins by the cashier and ask for another straw cos KYLE just gave us one piece of napkin and straw! Servers here can do more cos the place is so small,..very poor customer service esp KYLE!",

We ordered the Black Garlic and the Chicken Ramen.  The wife wasn't feel well, so she got the Chicken and was very pleased to have such a flavorful chicken Ramen. I had the Black Garlic and it was so savory with mulitiple flavors layered on one another. If you don't love garlic stay away from this one, but I loved it.  The best thing is we ordered it to go, got it home and it was still too hot to eat (had to blow on it). Bravo Ichi Ramen  There are many more flavors to try so I'll be back here again and again.",

The reason I subtracted a star was because it does take a while to get the food. Hopefully this gets better with time. I also wish they had a bigger selection of Ramen and a build your own Ramen dish.   Other than that I'd recommend eating here in the middle of the week when it's not so busy or getting your food to go.",

The restaurant decor is nice, it's very modern with stool seating, tables, and booths. The restaurant seats 62, which is small but normal for a ramen spot. My experience started on a sour note. After placing my name on the list for seating and waiting about 15 minutes, the server skipped me and tried to seat the party listed behind me. After I was seated, I ordered the shoyu ramen with corn and extra noodles. Every table gets their own pitcher of water which I appreciated. I felt from the time I ordered until the time I got my food was really long, especially for a ramen spot. Probably waited 20 minutes. I have a lot of the same complaints as other reviews about the ramen. It is very salty, the pieces of meat are very thin, and there is very little broth in your ramen. The only generous portion is the extra noodles which comes on a separate plate. This place isn't a terrible restaurant but I'll continue going to drive to Spring Mountain if I'm craving ramen.",

The noodles were of the same caliber as those packets that college students are so fond of. I ordered my Shoyu Ramen spicy and was disappointed. Spicy? I've had spicy Cheetos that are spicier. The chashu was hard when usually it should be tender.  I was so excited to have a ramen place near me buuuuuuuut we got this place instead. I'll gladly go to Chinatown for quality.",

Been here four times so far and all the food has been great. I have tried both the creamy tonkatsu and the black garlic ramen, and both were good, but the creamy is my fave. The chasu fried rice is one of the best I've had anywhere. My friend had the seafood ramen and she loved it.  The only reason I took away one star is because it is a tiny place with very little seating, and every time I have been there (variety of days and times) it has been super busy and there has been a wait. If you are by yourself, opt for the counter, it is usually not full.",

She sat other customers as well and she checked up on them a few times to make sure everything was good. She was very attentive to them and visited each table a few times except for ours. There were three of us and we ran out of water before we even got our food and nobody offered more. Not even at least once did she come and ask us if everything was okay. We were also waiting forever for our checks to come. I literally had to go up to the register myself, ask for our 3 separate checks, and also a bowl to go to take our Ramen home. When she wrote our order down, we told her that we wanted to pay separately and she STILL charged it all on one card because she claimed to not have felt the other trays that were underneath it. They were never even stacked to begin with and we had them layed out on the table. The food was amazing but honestly not good enough for us to come back. For what? More horrible service? It's a hard pass from all of us. She definitely lost customers.",

And the only recommendation I would have is to include more side Creature Comforts to add to broth like sesame seed oil and some dry or liquidy spice to spicing up the broth if we think it can go there. To end my passionate review and to give a reason for the one-star was for the nicely seasoned yet extremely thin slices of pork where I guess I'm normally used to nice thick slices from places like jinya or kokoro ramen.",

But once mixed together it honestly gives you a warm fuzzy feeling. I kinda wish there was a little more meat because I love protein in my ramen but one bowl filled me up and usually i eat 2-3 times the amount of noodles at monta. I love how they give you a whole bottle to fill your water cup instead of having to wait and ask for a refill, very efficient. I sat at the bar so there isn't a wall plug at the tables (or so I think). Friendly atmosphere, great music, CLEAN, service is on point! New favorite ramen spot. It honestly is \"HOT and NEW\"",

Tonkotsu and curry are tasty and really good. Couldn't say the same for black garlic since I compare it to the one in Silverlake Ramen, Los Angeles. I suggest the mgmt send a team out there to try it out and possibly mimic that recipe. Some people like it though, so I guess it's personal preference.   Side salad and gyoza are always good. Fried rice looks bomb but never really tried it. All other sides are simple yet fitting for a ramen house.   Service needs some shaping up but understandable since they just opened. I mostly care about food quality and value for money, so my rating is based on that.",

Chicken Karaage was nowhere near what it should be. It was like chicken bits in a breading that was too dense. Curry rice should be a plate of rice with curry spread over it, not rice drowning in curry. I must say that the curry was authentic Japanese curry though. Probably last time we'll visit here.",

    "text": "This place was pretty awesome! My family and I never heard of it and we were in the area, so we decided to try it out.  It was a late Thursday night and the place was really busy, so that gave us a good feeling like, \"Hey, this place MUST be good.\"  We got the table and our server, Joshua, greeted us with great energy and had my girls and me laughing.  He was courteous and, man, did he know the menu!  He had answers for every question I was going to ask before I asked them.  I was already set on getting the Black Garlic Ramen so I was laughing to myself when my girls made their orders and got the same thing.  Lord knows I love me some garlic in my food and this did not disappoint!  We also had some gyoza, tempura shrimp, and fried rice which were all enjoyable.  My girls and I would like to thank Joshua for his wonderful service.  This definitely will not be our last visit.",

Service was quick and friendly. Missing a star because parts of kitchen you could see from our seat were pretty dirty. They are fairly new though so we will give them another opportunity. Hopefully management gets the crew on a better cleaning schedule.",
