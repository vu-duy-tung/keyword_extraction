Make sure you call and get a reservation.  The place does have music playing that did seem loud at first but after getting seated it really was not even noticed.  One of the top items was the Chips and Salsa!!! Amazing.  I ordered Chicken Fajitas.  They were great the spice on the chicken was full of flavor but not too spicy.  My husband ordered TRIO DE ENCHILADAS DEL MAR he loves it three different items all full of seafood and cooked/season perfectly.  The only thing that was shocking was the Coke we ordered was In a bottle that was $8 each!! So our pops were more then one of our entries.  I get it but still shocked when we got the bill.  Service was good we did have to wait for refills of our water with was very noticeable.  The restaurant is very unique.",

Yes Javier's might be a little bit pricier than most, but worth every bite! I love the ambiance here as well. And their rice tastes like authentic Mexican rice, the kind my mom makes. Delicious! The carne asada tacos are great. The enchiladas verdes are my favorite and the sauce they use is to die for. Authentic quality food - worth the money.  I've been to their Newport Beach location and I still have to say the Vegas location is better. They are super friendly and accommodating as well.",

We made our journey down to the Aria to eat here specifically on my friends request because it's one of his favorite places to eat in California.  I ordered a chopped salad with chicken at $22 I was expecting one of the best salads I've ever had to come out of the kitchen, not the case.  Lacked dressing, portion was small and no wow factor.  I would have been much better off going to Chipotle and concocting my own salad creation and saving $15 lol.  My friend was saying the Vegas Javier's just isn't as on point as the one in Newport he frequents but he was still happy and really enjoyed his meal, which was a taco combination plate. (Why I gave them 3 stars, otherwise this would of been a solid 2 star experience)  Bottom line, the $$$ is no joke, this place is over priced, and the food was middle of the mall.",

I was craving for that spicy serrano bite. Still flavorful and enjoyable, but it just needed that \"in your face\" spice.  The CABO AZUL & TACOS DE CAMARON, I thought was deliciously...average. Good quality freshness in the seafood. I just wasn't blown away.   My $15 cocktail was really good though! Basically a margarita but I requested it with muddled jalapenos.

The mrs and I ordered the tablita that came with asada, chicken, and carnitas along with rice, beans, tortillas, guacamole, and grilled onions & peppers. The rice and beans were average. The best part of the meal was the carnitas. If I came back I would definitely order the carnitas plate. The tablita ran $50. We also got the jalapeno margaritas and they were really good.",

For $200 including the gratuity, we got: one margarita - per my daughter, it was amazing, octopus ceviche - was out of this world!, Enchilada platter - they were good, Grilled scallops with rice - was very good, Steak platter with enchilada and taquitos - Dad enjoyed it, Soft steak tacos - so, so  In my humble opinion, the dinner was not worth that much.

    "text": "If it were up to me, I'd probably give Javier's 2 stars, but since my dining companions didn't seem to have as strong of feelings as I did, I gave it an extra star. Situated off of the casino, you feel like you're worlds away inside the restaurant. Graceful arches punctuate the space while exposed beams and a variety of textures curate a dark and brooding, yet elegant ambiance. I really liked the setting itself, I just wasn't a fan of my entree.   I ordered, as I always do at Mexican restaurants, the chicken fajitas. The presentation was different from most in that there was no steaming skillet, but rather an artfully arranged mini tower of veggies and chicken on my plate. The chicken was marinated in adobo and tasted more like buffalo chicken than Mexican and was SPICY. I wasn't expecting it to be that spicy and was not a fan. It's also on the higher end for chicken fajitas at $27. My dining companions seemed to enjoy their meals so take my opinion with a grain of salt. The margarita was pretty good and reasonably priced at $12.   I am a frequent Vegas visitor but I doubt I'll return to Javier's. I think that for $250+ for four people there are a zillion other restaurants in Vegas where you get a lot higher quality food for your money. You can dress it up but at the end of the day, it's Mexican food and more expensive isn't always better.",

We made reservations (for two) got there on time, we were seated rigth away. Waiters were all friendly and fast.  Food was good i got the carnitas its served with rice, beans,salsa,tortillas,guacamole. Since its a fancy restaurant ($$) u get ur plate n everything is looking cute,pretty n smaller proportion, (im more the type of big portions served all over the plate lol)   Taste: carnitas were soft n moist, falling off the bone. Beans tasted homemade. Guacamole was good. Salsa was ok.   So we asked for the house spicier salsa if they had one n they did! and i mean spicy homemade salsa, (u only get it if u order it)  it was really good habanero salsa, do not order unless u like it super spicy .... otherwise stick with :it says hot in the bottle but its really not : cholula.  Javiers margarita was 15 bucks, pricey for a drink.... It was ok   Dessert: fried icecream, it was vanilla icecream on top of a mexican bunuelo  ( fried dough with cinammon n sugar) it was tasty.  Restaurant itself: this was the reason why we decide to dine here, the decor looks so cool n unique, comfy chairs.  So overall food is good - no complaints there, but pricey. It was round 100 bucks for our dinner, kinda pricey for me,  but if you like mexican food, good service and fancy ambient come here.",

Also, we still had to wait 15min for our table despite having a reservation.   Atmosphere: the decor was really interesting, including some fascinating wood carvings and a tequila tree. Unfortunately, tables were pretty close together, and it was almost too loud to even attempt talking.   Food: Mixed. I had carnitas which were pretty good (if a tad on the dry side).

Add some habanero if you dare & eat it on top of the salad or w/ the chips & ceviche!    I took one star off because out of all my reviews & loyalty to Javier's, my Octopus Ceviche as pictured versus the last two times clearly looks horrible.  It also tasted gritty.  The manager was no where to be found & I had to leave.  Mike the bartender is always fantastic.  What's up chef on Thursday 14th at 2:20pm?  Manager?    Mole Poblano, bone-in chicken, braised in a chocolatey mole w/ arroza, refritos & flour tortillas.  Delish!  Camrones Rancheros .. Wild premium Mexican White prawns sauteed in garlic butter, poblano, chiles, onions & tomato flavored w/ cilantro.   Trio de enchiladas Del Mar is a beautiful dish of a shrimp enchilada, crab enchilada & lobster enchilada w/ a lite tomatillo sauce that isn't overpowering.  Lite & delish.    Shredded Beef Enchiladas, Chile Rellenos & Shredded Chicken taco.  It's a combo & they cannot get the tacos right.  I love the grilled steak instead of beef enchiladas cause it has no caramelized veggies, which I hate.  Enchiladas de Mariscos stuffed w/ Dungeness Crab, shrimp, sauteed garlic butter & tomatillo sauce topped w/Monterey Jack Cheese.    Looking for A Vegan dish?  The Spinach Enchiladas & the Vegetarian Enchiladas are absolutely tasty & filling!  Huge starter that is cheesy & tasty is of course the Nachos de la casa & shredded chicken or beef.  Can't go wrong!    Add a Jalapeno Margarita, Mumm Rose or a beautiful glass of wine from the awesome wine list.  I've eaten here monthly since they opened, am an excellent critic of Javier's & love certain things.  Today was a bit off.    It's pricier than Mexican restaurants, but it's inside of Aria.  The food, drinks & ambience are totally different than our regular ma & pa's lovely restaurants.  I have regular favorites at both that I cannot find at either.  Irecommend sitting at Javier's bar or booths.  The chips & tasty salsa are fabulous, I usually ask for the Habanero.  Super HOT!",

I love them. But if you're going to call yourself \"upscale\" and charge over $30 for fucking fajitas, they better blow the wheels off a food truck) The only thing that saved our night at Javiers was our server who was an absolute delight, and the tamarindo margarita, which was one of the best drinks I've ever had.

    "text": "So my husband and i have been to numerous $$$$ type restaurants throughout LA & Vegas, and always wanted to try a high end Mexican restaurant. The decor: the inside looks amazing, we were literally considering redecorating parts of our house to look like this place.   The person who seated us (i believe a manager) was extremely professional and courteous he noticed we were looking at a piece of art on the wall, so he rearranged our seats so we could both look at it. Our waiter took our drink order and made it apparent that he was annoyed when my husband asked what they had for beers, the waiter let out a sigh and quickly rambled off the beers they had.   We didn't really think anything of it and ordered a Justin Cab ($18) & an IPA. We couldn't decide what to get so we wanted to started with trio of ceviche ($60) the ceviche gives 4 options of seafood but our waiter didn't care to ask which we would like. We didn't realize there were 4 flavors until he abruptly left after taking our order. We received the shrimp, ahi, & octopus ceviche from a bus boy who was very polite.   We should tell you that we've had ceviche several times & my husband has made it at home numerous times. We were disappointed to see that the ahi was just poke with some onions on it. The octopus was very tender but needed a little salt. The shrimp was a bit tough and rubbery. Honestly the taste was not bad for each of them but considering it was $60 for a trio, we realized there was nothing special to substantiate the price. We've had $10 ceviche that was much better. After we received the ceviche the waiter came by to check on us approximately 3-4 minutes later asking for our dinner orders we were in the middle of eating and laughed said sorry we were to busy enjoying the ceviche we haven't looked at the menu.   Apparently that was the wrong thing to say because it took him another 20-30 minutes before we saw him again. At this point we realized the highlight of the restaurant would most likely just be the decor.   Conclusion: ceviche shouldn't cost $60 unless a more unique version was made using superior ingredients. That wasn't a big issue as we were enjoying a night alone in Vegas kid free, but the service would not have been adequate for a chili's or Denny's. Honestly if our waiter was better we would have ordered more food. We were looking forward to margaritas and the rib eye.   We are a younger couple and maybe people don't think we have money (That was the vibe).  We both didn't say anything to each other until the end when we both spontaneously agreed \"This guy is kind of rude right?\"  My husband was in a suit and i had a dress on, so dress code wasn't an issue.  Sucks but oh well.  We sat their finishing the last of our beer and wine. Ceviche still on our platter.  A busboy approached us and reaches into our table while asking if we were done.  What do i say as he he's lunging toward the plate. It appeared to us that finishing my plate would be an inconveniance.   We hadnt had a date night in 4 months, drove from CA, and got a babysitter.  We picked the hotel based on the restaraunts.  Aria spa was great, Cosmo restaraunts had much better service.",

I have never seen a Mexican restaurant mess up fajitas before but congratulations Javier for managing to run the simplest of all dishes.  Legitimately, the Guacamole and martinis are most excellent but the rest of the food is just so bland. I would have preferred to eat at Taco Bell then going to Javier's.

    "text": "Been to Javier's a few times and in the past I've had less than a good experience but recently when I went, I don't know if their staff or chefs changed but everything we tried was beyond tasty and made to perfection.   Starting from their queso dip to their spicy salsa and their tasty enchiladas, all of their dishes were perfectly executed. What is great is you don't have to order an entire plate of enchiladas if you aren't too hungry and can do an a la cart style where you can order one enchilada with sauce. It's a pretty big portion. They have vegan options and gluten free options. The vegan and gluten free enchilada was a spinach, zucchini and corn enchilada with a. True vegan green sauce that doesn't have any animal by product wrapped in a corn tortilla. One of the best Mexican food restaurants in Vegas hands down. The ambiance is electric and eclectic. The dia de las muertes vibe adds a interesting feel to this restaurant.   Try their spicy margaritas with their assortment of tequilas from their tequila tree. You can thank me later!",

    "text": "Located in the Aria casino, this is a great spot if you're in the mood for Mexican. It is more upscale than the typical Mexican restaurant, but you could still dress casually and not feel awkward. The service was excellent, and you get complimentary chips and salsa like any good Mexican restaurant would offer. The chips were on point, but I was even more impressed with the salsa. It has just the right amount of spice and heat. I could've just had chips and salsa for dinner and been very happy.  My friend and I each got the enchilada and taco combo, which comes with refried beans and rice. The enchilada (I got mine with chicken and green sauce) and taco (I got mine crispy with beef) were both excellent. I'd say the beans and rice were a bit lacking in flavor, but I still ate them. As is typical for Vegas, you're going to pay more than is probably worth what you get, but at least since the food and service is excellent, you won't mind as much.",

The carnitas (they were ribs NOT the traditional Mexican carnitas) were very dry when my husband returned the plate (mind you he took a couple bites of 1 rib)  the manager came and said \"I saw the plate you can't return it, you ate it\" we were surprised being that he had 1 bite and the food was all there. Any case we weren't going to make a big deal over a meal and paid. FOOD SEAMS TO BE LEFT SITTING UNDER A WARMER FOR A LONG TIME! DOESN'T TASTE FRESH",

Start with one of their signature cocktails and enjoy their chips and salsa. Try the Tablita, a DIY taco platter served on a plank (this is enough for 3-4 to share or two extremely hungry people). You can try a combination of proteins (chicken, steak or pork) as well as corn or flour tortillas (ask for both). All of the flavors are well balanced but you can add jalapenos for that extra kick of spice.   Service is attentive and quite good.",

Finally I asked the server why Javier played the radio so loud? He brought who appeared to be the big boss over and they took it down a notch..

Unfortunately, the noise level is pretty intense, plus we had a group of about 10 sitting 2 tables away that were more than boisterous. A group across from us asked to be moved because of the noise.   The food: disappointing. We ordered the queso fundido as a starter, I had the carnitas and my wife had the skirt steak fajitas. The salsa was mild with  corn chps. I asked for spicy salsa and they brought an assortment of 4 salsas, each different. A nice thought, but the only spicy one was a pureed habanero salsa, thinned with water - not very imaginative. The salsas get a 3.   The queso was tasty, but very thick. It needed a bit of thinning to make it easier to serve. The queso gets a 4. The.carnitas are not really carnitas, but a slab of pork loin that's either been slow roasted, or braised, then browned. It was very dry and did not.have the flavor of True carnitas. The carnitas get a 1. The fajitas, in a departure from Tex-Mex are heavily marinated and.cooked with onion, tomatoes and pasillas - no bell peppers. They got a 3.   Service was good, shifted between a waiter.and bussers. For the money, we wouldn't.go back. No alcohol and, with tip, over 100 bucks for 2 people for Mexican food.",

Two shrimp tacos prepared Ensenada style in a flour tortilla with salsa fresca, shredded cabbage and a cilantro-jalapeno aioli. Served with black beans and white rice. While the shrimp in these tacos were good, they were not the best tacos I've had. The rice and beans were pretty bland too. I'm mainly giving this place 4 stars for the freakin' chips and salsa. That salsa was so addicting... I also ordered a side of haberno sauce for my tacos and they were SO spicy but SO delicious. Highly recommend getting that.  My friend also ordered the ahi ceviche which came out poke style. This was also good. Generous amounts of fresh fish AND avocados. Yum.  I'd come back here again for some drinks/snacks, but the food is just not something I'd crave (minus the salsa).",

Pork a little on the tough and dry side. Beans, guacamole & fresh tortillas were great.  Shrimp enchilada good but nothing out of this world.  Overall very good. Service was great at the bar even with how busy it was.",

One look at the bottle and I knew I was gonna need a third mortgage to pay for it. I ordered a qusadilla with chicken and a steak salad. Both unimpressive and if I had ordered that at a normal restaurant I would have expected to pay about 15 bucks the bill without tip was 54.00! A complete rip off. It was on a comp but seriously? I want some of what they are smoking. As soon as I mentioned it was a comp my server turned cold..little did she know I tipped 30% because it was a comp. I would never spend MY money in this place. Completely mediocre garbage. Why don't these places bother to put as much into what they serve as they do in the surroundings they are served in? The extra star was for my server she was pretty good until I mentioned it was a comp. Bet she felt like a moron when she saw what I left her...can you imagine the tabs for let's say 4 people who are drinkers..wow..tourist trap",

Think upscale with old macabre carvings, candlelight, and dark wood.  Sit in the horseshoe-shaped booths if you can - very romantic!  They started us out with chips and salsa - the chips were still hot and the salsa was perfection!  You can tell a lot about a place from the salsa.  I wish I could have tried a cocktail (and I suppose I could have) but it was noon and I still hadn't had my morning coffee.  In hindsight, go for the cocktail.  Chips and salsa + coffee = weird.  Chips and salsa + a margarita = just right.    My man had the Cabo Azul combination plate, and I filched more than a few bites.  Just the right touch with seafood and sauces!  I had the chile relleno with picadillo and that was also delicious.  The beans and rice were not an afterthought, either - they stood out on their own with the right seasoning and flavor.  Loved it!",

The signature margaritas are small, comprised of more than half ice and good but not spectacular. The tortilla chips are plentiful and tasty. The server helpfully steered me away from items that would have conflicted with my allergies, even checking on the marinade ingredients. My fish was perfectly cooked and delicious. The accompanying veggies were crisp and not at all an afterthought. My companion had an assortment of dishes and enjoyed them all. Each dish was fresh tasting, not heavy and canned as Mexican can sometimes be.    The prices are on the higher side, but they are commensurate with the quality of the food, if not the cocktails.",

    "text": "This review is based solely on the atmosphere, service, margaritas and chips and salsa. While walking through Aria looking for a bar to get a drink at we stumbled upon Javier's. There was plenty of open seats at the bar so we took two of them. The bar itself seems to be the centerpiece of the restaurant with a huge tent-like feel made of ropes. It was pretty cool. We got a drink menu right away and there were at least a dozen different margaritas to choose from. Real margaritas with fresh ingredients, good tequila and on the rocks (the only way). My wife had a pineapple margarita which was very good and not too sweet. I had their house margarita which was very good. The fresh squeezed limed juice gave it a great tangy and refreshing taste. It wasn't sweet at all which I enjoyed. It was just pure awesomeness.  What put this place over the top for me was their amazing chips and salsa. The chips were hot from the fryer (or oven to warm them) and not greasy at all. The salsa was probably the best I've ever had. Spicy, fresh and just chunky enough. It coated the chips perfectly. This is a big deal for me because I live in an area where Mexican food is about as good as you're going to get it outside of Mexico.  I could see how this place would turn into a loud tequila drinking college fest quite quickly late at night. I wouldn't make a trip here during late night hours.",

    "text": "I've been here twice and I have to tell you, it just gets better and better with each visit.   Initially, my mother, sister and I came here about 3 years ago on the recommendation of a friend we made at the pool, who said that this is probably one of the better restaurants in Las Vegas. He was NOT wrong, whatsoever. My mother and I ordered the Tablet, my sister something I can't remember, and it was such a beautiful, delicious experience with great service. Fast forward 3 years later, my group of friends and I were deciding on where to go for our fancy group dinner and I immediately remembered how fantastic Javier's was - they looked it up and agreed. Long story short, EVERYONE was super impressed, but long story is still below for your reading pleasure.  Located inside the newer Aria hotel, Javier's is straight on the first floor, not too deep into the casio. Unassuming from outside, you're greeted by a very kind hostess who takes you to your table. I do really suggest making a reservation, because you will wait, especially on a weekend dinner. We got our table immediately, since we were a larger party, and had a couple moments to really take in the restaurant and see if there was anything we'd like to drink which is always appreciated.  The ambiance of Javier's alone is enough to dine here, even if the food was mediocre (its not). Dim lighting throughout the high, arched ceilings, accentuate the sensual atmosphere. Architecturally, its very Spanish Hacienda with white walls, dark wood furniture, comfy warm leather booths. The bar in the middle is slightly modern, and there is a gorgeous, giant wall - handmade metal art, depicting skulls and a variety of beautiful art. Skim through the photos, it doesn't even do it justice how COOL IT IS. Everyone in our group was marvelling about how beautiful it is.  Service is fabulous as well. Our server was incredibly patient in answering all of our questions, especially with a group of 17. He was never pushy about upselling but did suggest things that could enhance our experience. We received our beverages quickly (considering there were at least 10 cocktails) and our food came out timely as well. Anything that wasn't finished was packed tableside for us. Bathrooms do have attendants; my fiance got me a single stem rose, which was nothing short of a fabulous surprise.   Drinks were delicious. Some in our group ordered beer or wine, I didn't pay attention to whether or not they liked it, but those of us who ordered cocktails were very pleased by how balanced they were, which is always a struggle. I chose a Prickly Pear Margarita which I do recommend, but if you like spicy, my fiance did love his Jalapeno Margarita. We ordered about two rounds each because it was just so fantastic.   Food! Where do I start! The guacamole was great, but I don't really remember much other than liking it. What I will talk about is that Tablet! Or whatever its called. You are doing yourself a giant disservice if you don't order that. We got it with Carnitas and Carne Asada and ordered 2 shrimp to go with it and Jesus H. Christ, I dream about that every once in a while. The Carnitas is on the bone, exquisitely crispy on the outside, yet delicious and soft the deeper you get into the bone - some of the best carnitas ever. The Carne Asada was cooked to a MR perfection and thinly sliced; the cut of meat itself was flavorful. The Shrimp were jumbo shrimp that really just tasted like lobster it was great. Everything else on the tablet was delicious as well, but you do get your money's worth. We didnt finish it; in fact, if you have smaller appetites, they say its for 2, but 3 people can easily share that. Get an appetizer if you're not sure how much you can eat, but trust me when I say that it is definitely a good portion of food.  All in all, I really can't wait to go back. It is an absolutely fun experience and you can truly enjoy yourself there with no rush.",

    "text": "I'm rounding up a bit and giving 4 stars.  So torn between 3 and 4, but I will go with 4 because the service was great!  First impression:  love the booths!  Super comfy.  They have a private dining room that looks like it can seat up to 12...oh my that room looks fancy!   Romantic mood overall.  Good for date night.  Being from San Diego, I have eaten a ton of Mexican food in my life.  Granted, I KNOW I'm on the strip.  I know that for sure.  I hate even mentioning price in reviews (unless it's in a good way) because it's on the strip, so I should know what I'm getting into.  I just think some of the menu was a lot higher than it could have been.  I reiterate, I knew this going into a strip restaurant, so I can't be that booty hurt about it.  The appetizer was just, meh.  We got the sampler plate.  The best part was the shrimp quesadilla.  The empanada was no bueno.  Maybe I'm used to the little old lady in San Diego who makes them in her house and fries them fresh right before we pick up, so honestly it's not even a fair comparison.    I got a shrimp salad that was very fresh and tasty.  My husband got a $52 carne asada plate.  He LOVED the black beans and roasted pepper.  The chips and salsa were decent.  Margaritas were yummy, but honestly, I don't think I've met a margarita I DIDN'T like (premixed Jose Cuervo included, hahaha).  All in all, great atmosphere and a good choice if you're going to see a show in Aria and want to stay in the same vicinity.  Great for date night.  Would I go out of my way to go here again?  Not sure, maybe just for margaritas and snacks.  But great if you're staying at Aria and don't want to leave property.",

Not so much.  It's always been mediocre, but recently we had such awful service I sent an email to the manager explaining our lack of attention, lack of apology & pure awful business lunch there recently. I politely offered some recommendations to ensure future diners do not have the same experience.  I expected some sort of response.  I waited.  I called and left a message for the manager. Sent a second email.  No response.  They must be accustomed to tourists and not concerned with locals/reoccurring business.  We will not be back.",

    "text": "I've had two good dining experiences here and everyone I was with liked what they ordered. They also liked their margaritas, which were quite strong.  The house special La Tablita is a make-your-own-taco platter that \"serves two.\" It easily could've served four. We ordered it with steak and carnitas.   Some of the carnitas were ribs--I've never seen that before--it's usually pork shoulder or butt. I love carnitas, theirs was good, but would've been better if the meat had been broken into chunks before browning. Instead, it was served it in two solid chunks so most of the meat was dry and not crispy from being fried up in oil or fat before serving.  Summary: Really good Mexican at ridiculous Vegas prices. And of course the place is ridiculously loud, like everywhere you go on the wacko Strip.",

Moises is a piece of work, when faced with a complaint he came over and gave a quick dismissal of my issue with an utterance of he can't do anything for me.  I was completely offended because I didn't ask for anything however I paid a $280.00 bill so if the experience wasn't to my liking I'd like to relay my issue to the boss for further notice.  Oddly they decided to have a photo shoot at the time I was dining, it wasn't a big deal until the staff started hovering over my table for about two hours.  I won't return to this location!  Time is money and I felt I wasted both, they definitely need to teach Moises the value of people who spend up to $300.00 for a meal and how that enables him to pay his personal bills.",

    "text": "Absolutely incredible. I almost want to fly back to Vegas just so I can eat here again.   Where do I start.   Huge selection of interesting margaritas, and when you order one it is very strong. The margaritas are a pretty big bang for your buck.   The table salsa was the best I've ever had at any Mexican restaurant. Full of flavor and served with warmed chips, we couldn't get enough of it. We probably ate 3-4 bowls of it, with each bowl costing nothing and empty bowls being frequently replaced by the wait staff.   And speaking of service, they were extremely nice and gave excellent recommendations.   We started off with Ceviche de Cameron and it was the best ceviche I've ever had. They probably had the shrimp marinating for several hours, as the whole thing was overwhelmingly delicious. Served with the familiar Tapatio hot sauce, the ceviche here had me licking the plate. Ceviche is probably what this place does best.  The entrees were also extremely rich. I got the Chile Negro and the beef was so incredibly tender and rich that I was also licking my plate by the end of it. My significant other got the Chile Rellenos and they were actually authentic and not drenched in cheese as most Mexican restaurants do. The peppers were loaded with tender beef and probably topped any Chile Relleno you'd get elsewhere.  The price was super expensive for two people, but I don't regret any of it. This place is truly a \"get what you pay for\" type of place, and I'll definitely be coming back.",

The drinks are excellent, pricey, but large and strong so worth it on a Vegas scale I'd say.  Minus one star because our host made a reservation and while we were promptly seated, drinks took forever, apps took forever, dinner took forever.  And we wanted a long meal, don't get me wrong, but I had to waive down the staff a number of times to just try to get what you wanted.  So they had a lot of staff working there but our party of 11 or 12 had to kind of keep the staff on their toes to get beers and we had to ask for everything, it wasn't a how's your meal or do you need more water or a drink.  Ceviche was good. Overall a pricey meal but unique enough dinner orders to justify it, thus the four stars.  I'd bet a smaller party would yield better service?",

The ceviche was too acidic, and you could tell none of the flavors were soaked together before they were tossed to go to your plate.

    "text": "Located inside the beautiful Aria Hotel & Casino you will find this fine dining Mexican restaurant Javier's. Last week I had some family in town that was staying at the Vdara hotel which is basically right next door to Aria. Majority of the party all agreed on wanting a good place that offered Mexican food on their last night in Las Vegas. With being so close to Aria I thought to myself well what better opportunity then now to schedule a reservation at Javier's.   I called into the MLife reservation line and was told that the next available reservation wasn't until 10:30 PM and at the time I called it was only around 8:15PM (ish). That wasn't going to fly with a bunch of hungry people but something told me to just try and do a walk in and yeah they were able to get us seated in not even less than 30 minutes. I thought this was odd especially because you would've thought that they'd offered better service to an MLife member over the phone...    Upon arrival we were kindly greeted and let the hostess know that we had literally just made reservations and were offered to check out the bar area until the table was ready. Half of our party went to wonder around and gamble and the remaining stayed at got some drinks and little bites to eat. The Jalapeno margarita was highlighted by one of the bartenders as one of their most popular drinks so we started with a round of those and wow they were delicious! In addition to the margaritas we also ordered the \"Trio de Ceviche\" which gives you a choice of either Camaron, Pulpo, Pescado or Ahi.. We selected everything but the Pulpo. Now ceviche is one of my favorite dishes and I have to be honest it was just okay.. I really didn't get that over the top taste and have had it at places a lot less fancier and it was better.. My aunt and uncle also agreed but by this time our table was ready!   Once we were finally seated our waiter came over who by the way was very nice and did a great job with giving us some recommendations. For me I have been on this Pescatarian diet for almost 6 months so I asked about what were some of the best seafood dishes. I ended up getting the \"Fideo Del Mar\" which is a Seafood linguine with shrimp and Dungeness crab in a spicy tomato cream sauce, topped with a wild Mexican white prawn and a fresh, wild scallop, garnished with Cojita cheese and green onion. I would give the dish 4/5 it was definitely good!   Overall I would have to say that the experience was great. Customer service can really make or break the experience and so I battled with going with 3 or 4 stars but the service from the hostess to the bartender to our server was all great and the average of 3 stars for the food bumped them up a star. I say an average of 3 stars food wise based of the \"so so\" answers of everybody at the table. We can all agree that it's pretty pricey for what you get in actuality.. However I always have to argue the fact of location location location!! I'm convinced that I should possibly return and give them another try to give me that WOW factor on the food side.",

    "text": "To start it off with - I came in with a friend for dinner pre concert at T-Mobile. The place was packed, as always, and we found ourselves in the back area considered bar seating since there was a ridiculous line to wait, but totally understandable based on the circumstances.   Anyways, took like 25 minutes for a cocktail waitress to take our order while another one ignored us. We got jalapeno margs (so good but a little too sweet for me) and shared a seafood quesadilla. Let me tell you - I was so skeptical but that thing was a delicious. Who would think cheese, crab, and shrimp in a quesadilla would be that delicious? I wasn't even hungry! And praise the man who brought us chips, salsa, and water while we waited for the cocktail waitress. He really held us over. Plus he was super sweet and the most attentive to us.   For two margs and a seafood quesadilla was around $85 after tip. A little pricey but it is the Aria/the strip and it was pretty good.   To be honest - I will most likely come back to do a full dining experience. It's just always packed and I think it's lame you can't open table a reservation. The enchiladas ordered by a gent at the table next to us looked delicious and there are plenty of items I'd love to try. I will most likely update my review if I ever get a chance to get a damn table in this place.   In their defense too - I've been on the other side - I've been working when it's super slammed and you're fully in the weeds but our cocktail waitress we ended up with was super nice and the girl she was working with was great at ignoring people and seemed lazy but their managers were busting their butts (very admirable).   Other than that - food and drinks are great - expensive and worth it. I would come check it out but couldn't give it 4 or 5 stars cause of the service. Hopefully that will change soon though!",

    "text": "The atmosphere at this hot spot in the Aria hotel is impressive for sure, with sparkling art fixtures like a tequila \"tree\" and giant wooden depiction of the Mayan creation myth set across a backdrop of elegant arches and dark leather. Absolutely worth stopping by for a drink if you can stomach the wait, acknowledging that you'll pay extra for the ambiance (but you're in Vegas, so that's a given).   The drinks were underwhelming - I ordered a spicy margarita that was so mild that we had to ask for extra chilies on the side. The salsa was delicious and actually packed a kick, which scored Javier's some points in the positive column. Table service was decent, especially given we had a massive party of 12, although the timing was inconsistent on bringing everyone's entrees.  But the key driver of my rating was naturally the food, which serves as a take on upscale authentic Mexican cuisine. At a $40 price point for the Cabo Azul, I needed the kitchen to bring the heat and, while the portions were respectable, I left feeling pretty meh about the meal. The Maine lobster enchilada topped with a zesty green sauce was by far the highlight of the dish although I thought they could have heaped more of said sauce over top. The chili relleno stuffed with shrimp and crab didn't really come together for me. It tasted exactly like it sounds, with none of the ingredients or flavors really complementing or elevating one another. The shrimp taco was a nice little appetizer, but it wasn't quite enough to capture my imagination. Others at the table seemed to really relish their dinner, even some who had the same dish as me, so take my review with a grain of salt. It was a good meal in my opinion, but not a great one, in a 5-star locale.",

    "text": "We ate at Javier's one recent evening after seeing a nearby show.  The restaurant was definitely set up to be on the romantic side with dim lighting and candles on the table.  The complimentary chips and salsa were great. Chips were good, but i thought that the salsa was outstanding. I had the chicken mole enchiladas which were very good. My wife had the combo with enchilada, taco and chile relleno. She was nice enough to share a bite of the taco which was good. She also had the mango margarita which was good and strong.  Service was friendly and efficient. Price for dinner was decent for strip hotel levels. Not inexpensive by any means, but when a dinner buffet for two at most of the strip hotels is $100 and weekend dinner at the fancy one at Caesar's is $150, it's all relative.  Four stars overall.",

    "text": "City center here in Las Vegas is a great location to find 5 star accommodations and great restaurants. One perk of my job is I get to represent my team at conferences here in town, being a local, work doesn't have to pay for flights, hotels or rental cars. With that said, I had a colleague coming to meet me for a conference and she had wanted to try Javiers for a while..  Food - Like the Javiers in Southern California, the food here was amazing. Everyone's meal came out and was great, Javiers always seems to have a great flavor to their traditional and fusion style offerings.   Service - This restaurant was really busy but you wouldn't know it by the service we received. Our wait staff took great care of us. It was little things like making sure our drinks stay full to fresh salsa, they were on point.  So great food, great service, why not a 5 star? The one thing is they were playing the music in the restaurant very loud, thus everyone was talking over the music so they can carry on their conversations. I get it, we were in a trendy restaurant at the Aria is a very nice hotel, just seemed the music volume could have been a little lower, but again this is just my opinion.   All in all, we both enjoy their food and hope to visit again soon",

Supposedly they were closed for maintenance but the table they sat us at looked really stained and dirty.  Best place to get a margarita. Or at least it was.

Bar tender made my wife a Tamarindo margarita which she enjoyed and he made me a Mezcal -Casamigos margarita which I really enjoyed. We get the phone call from restaurant confirming our table was ready and just walk over to our table. We were immediately waited by the young man who poured us water and brought more chips with that delicious homemade salsa. Just minutes later our waiter Jesus approach and ask if we had any questions and was honest with a few recommendations on the menu. We really enjoyed the service, the food, drinks and ambiance, with good music and much to appreciate with all decor. Definitely not our last time here and will recommend to all friends, Family & anyone looking for authentic Mexican food. A True hit for us",

Last time I was here, our food took over an hour when the restaurant was almost empty, and my food wasn't hot at all. However, this was definitely better than the last time we were here.   Even though they were packed, the hosts managed to seat us quickly, although there was some confusion as to who our server was. I got the tamarindo margarita, which was a little sweet for my taste, but it was pretty strong as well.   Their chips and salsa are freshly made. They do have a habanero salsa if you like things spicy. I am warning you, it is spicy. And I love spicy. So use with caution  Both Jacob and his dad ordered the chile verde which I believed they both loved as they left their plates empty when we left. The food did take around half an hour, but they were really clear about the time it would take.   I ordered the Cabo Azul and it is absolutely delicious. It is a big portion as it comes with a lobster and shrimp enchilada, lobster stuffed chile relleno, rice, beans and a fish taco. I do recommend either sharing this, or taking it home. The fish taco was amazing as well as the chile relleno, I did wish the stuffing for the enchilada had more flavor, but the sauce was really good. I would definitely recommend this place",

Once we sat, the bartender came over right away to get our drink order.  We ended up asking for his recommendations, and he did not steer us wrong! I ended up with one of the most well-made margaritas I've ever had! Unfortunately, I was not able to order another after that, as the bartender was no where to be found once our order was placed.  There were multiple bartenders running back and forth taking care of guests but none of them stopped to ask if we needed anything and we didn't see the one we had ordered from again.  We ended up having to stop a busser to get us a couple of things once we got our food and had to flag down a nearby bartender when we wanted our check.  The service went from amazing to abysmal very quickly.   As far as the food goes, we ordered guacamole as an appetizer.  It came out quickly. But I get better guac at Chipotle.  If I were to ever return, I would definitely not waste my money on it. For my entree, I opted for Relleno de Picadillo.  The beef was seasoned well and I did enjoy it.  It was a good size portion and, if my hotel had a fridge, I would've taken the rest to go.    Like I said, our service was horrible, even sitting at the bar.  That alone makes me not want to waste my time or money here on any future trip to Vegas.",

    "text": "We stumbled upon Javier's during our aggressive lounging fiasco. For those of you who are unfamiliar, aggressive lounging is when you hotel hop along the Vegas strip hitting up at least one lounge per hotel for a drink or appetizer.   First on our stop, Javier's at Aria Resort and Casino! We we're instantly drawn to the decor; a massive thick steeple with dangling ropes mid bar, also noticing the intimate executive personal party room with a beautiful wooden table, the \"tree of life,\" wall decor adorned with so many various bottles of expensive tequilas, and most of all the intricate chainsaw carved wall paneling of purgatory! We quickly invited our newly wed friends to join us!   Upon their arrival, we order, and my guest and I shared a plate. This is what we decided on:   ANTOJITOS SABOR A PROVINCIA Two Empanadas, two small Quesadillas, two Taquitos, two Sopes.  ENCHILADAS DE MARISCOS Two enchiladas stuffed with shrimp and Dungeness Crab sauteed in butter, garlic, onion and wine, then covered in a tomatillo sauce, melted Monterey Jack cheese and garnished with avocado slices and sour cream. Served with arroz and refritos.  CARNE TAMPIQUENA New York steak #1 prime center cut 6oz grilled, accompanied by a mole chicken enchilada, taquito, and refritos.  Highlights of Javier's has to be their  shockingly authentic Mexican flavors. From the salsa, to the margaritas, beans made with chorizo, authentic Mexican rice, flautas, and killer mole sauce, everything tasted homemade and delicious!  Located in the Aria, expect to pay a pretty penny. For 4 people, 3 dishes and drinks, our tab including tip was $200. Next time, I'm going to ask to be seated at the private party table! Lol!",

I was going to order some dessert but he wasn't around for some reason, yet the restaurant is actually not busy at all. When I decided to skip the dessert I had to get someone's attention to ask for my check. My waiter is not around. Such a shame. That's why I'm giving two stars even tho the food is pretty tasty.

It ran about $280 for 4 adults do make sure you're aware.  You could do that place for less but if you drink, just make sure you know.  Enchiladas Pueblo are to die for.  Lobster filled and absolutely delicious. Fresh avocado on each enchilada and every bite is delectable.  Also something that most people don't know about Strip restaurants... Usually they will take special requests since it is hospitality central. So if you see something you like but are allergic, ask. They might be able to accommodate.",

The food is good on the whole but my issue with this restaurant has nothing to do with the food or menu.  The thing is, this could be the best tasting food in the world but dining at javiers is very unpleasant and annoying.  Why?   They have an extreme identity crisis.  They don't know the difference between a restaurant and a dance club.  The music playing in the restaurant is so extremely loud you'll either find yourself yelling at each other just to be heard, or you simply give up and don't talk to each other at all.  So what you end up with is a restaurant that is blasting music at a dicibel rate higher than the output of a jumbo jet engine and a dining room full of people yelling over the incessant blasting noise of the music.  All this makes eating here extremely stressful and unpleasant to anyone seeking a nice peaceful dining experience.  The manager of this place must be deaf.  I hope he can read.",

Newly opened next to the casino floor in the Aria Hotel and Casino in City Center, Las Vegas, NV, Javier's is a beautiful facility. Mostly done in dark colors (black) with strategic lighting it is a comfortable place to dine. First impressions of any Mexican restaurant will be the salsa and chips--well after two full baskets of chips and two dishes of salsa, I can say that I approve of the salsa; in fact it is really good!  Javier's has a complex menu of choices including several house specials. Well, I'm a simple guy and ordered the Enchilada and Taco combination plate. Not your usual Taco Bell food! High quality food, well prepared and nicely presented. The taco was crisp and crunchy and tasted great. While higher priced than your local family joint, if you are in Vegas and looking for a great up-scale Mexican meal, I can highly recommend Javier's. In fact, on future visits to Aria, Javier's is on my list of things to do again. Oh, while you are in Javier's, make sure you get a close look at the back wall of all hand carved figures; a must see!",

I love Javier's because it is fresh , very citrusy, and more meat than liquid.   Another plus is that their drinks are strong, good strong like I can have one drink and not need a second one where usually I do get 2 at other restaurants. So even though the margarita are 14-16$ it's worth it when you get your money's worth of liquor. These margaritas aren't shy. Neither am I but I've never sent a drink back here. Really happy about that.  If I had to list a con about this place I would say just beware it's pretty dim so those with poor eye sight may need the assistance of a cell phone flash light or something equivalent to see the menu clearly. Otherwise, enjoy!",

Located at the Aria Hotel in Vegas, it's the perfect place to enjoy a meal and sip on delicious margaritas with an intimate feel.   In addition to experiencing the ambience, the food here is exceptionally tasteful.  No complaints here. Although eating high priced Mexican food can be questionable in terms of how creative can you get with rice and beans ? Well Javier's demonstrates that.  I dinned here simply because it is Kobe Bryant's favorite restaurant.  I was impressed with the ominous decor. The leather menu, leather tables, 3D like paintings, and all black everything made this place appealing.  The menu can be overwhelming since there too many items to mention but there is a large Sea Food portion on the menu. I ordered the Lobster Enchiladas and yes it was brilliant. Everything about the taste of the food was fresh and I assume it took time to make. The presentation of the food was ok, nothing to brag about. The portion was perfect and not to skimpy like most bougie restaurants.   Javier's is also famous for their Guacamole and I can't agree more since I liked it alot !   You get what you pay for and the service was excellent ! Please plan and reserve accordingly since this place does get overly booked.   I will definitely be returning soon :)",

Chips and salsa again just like in Cali! Service was efficient, had an early dinner at 4:30 or so.  Would have given 4.5-5 stars but the food was not hot, but I was famished. Plus no happy hour specials; come on people this is Vegas!!!",

The lobster enchiladas and chile rellenos were awesome! The only negative thing about this restaurant is how dark and loud it was. But, we were in Vegas so I cannot complain about those things when all else was so great!",

    "text": "I was in town a night prior to my group arriving and was looking for a \"fun\" environment with some interesting food. I was walking by Javier's and the place just pulled me in.  As I was dining alone, I was more than happy to take a seat at the bar. Unfortunately, the bar was packed, as was the dining room. I told the hostess I would wait for the bar as I did not want to tie up seating. Just as I said this, a server had cleared a small booth and insisted I sit down and enjoy myself.  Kara, my server, immediately came over and offered some chips while I checked out the menu. I asked her for some recommendations and then pondered my choices while she went to retrieve my margarita. The margarita arrived and was exceptional. Kara took my order and I munched on some fresh chips with a refreshing and flavorful homemade salsa.  When Kara came back to take my order, I asked her if it was possible to tweak the Quesadilla de Mariscos. She ran to the kitchen and to my delight, the chef was more than amicable about my request (not exactly common today, especially in a high volume restaurant). The order arrived and it looked and tasted great. The portion was more than enough for one person and could have easily fed a couple ( there was plenty left on my plate, only because I could not eat another bite). Texture was perfect and the flavors were incredible.  I was completely full but not ready to move just yet as I was really enjoying the people watching. I asked my server if she needed the table and she told me to relax and enjoy myself. I ordered another drink and stayed for about 10-15 minutes to enjoy it without any pressure to turn over the table.  Price is a bit expensive for Mexican food, but well worth it, at least in my eyes. I don't mind paying if I am getting exceptional service and food, and both where delivered here.  Just an additional note about my server as I hope management takes the time to read this. Kara truly went out of her way to make sure I was comfortable and kept company during my meal since I was dining alone. Her section was packed, but she came over numerous time to \"chat\" with me and make sure I felt comfortable there. Being a former food and beverage director as well as general manager of a restaurant, I know how hard it can be to find \"all stars,\" of which she is truly one.  Just a great overall experience and I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone visiting Las Vegas that would like to enjoy some serious and inventive Mexican cuisine.",

Long story short, bill was more than advertised menu price, brought to managers attention (white lady with blonde hair, think Tanya Harding mid-90s look and you will recognize her) she basically said too bad so sad, I said that's not acceptable for a quesadilla to be on the menu for $16.00 and you try to bill $20.00  She had no recourse or excuse, provided the bill without a pen. I asked for a pen and a waiter standing around (think Marc Anthony reject) threw a pen at me to sign. I immediately let Aria Conceirege know about the level of service being provided at Javier's and they immediately rectified the situation while letting the food and beverage manager know as well. Food was bland and average, nowhere near caliber of original Javier's in so cal.",

    "text": "Javier's Oh Javiers!! Muchas gracias is all I have to say, and thank you to Aria for putting in this new gem just in time for our weekend getaway. We came here 3 times in the weekend that we were here so that says something about our feelings for Javier's. The place has such a cool atmosphere, ropes coming out of the bar, an incredible panel of skulls and all things scary carved out of wood on one side of the restaurant, really a site to see. The place has this intimate dark feel with mexican music always playing, it's like you just want to be there.  Now onto the important stuff, la comida which means food in Spanish. BEST SALSA I have ever had in my life, no seriously, and I'm from Chicago where we have some of the best Mexican restaurants around like Mercadito and Rick Bayless's Frontera Grill, but Javier's salsa and warm chips were just perfection. It was spicy yet flavorful and the chips were thin but not too thin and super crispy and fresh. And it's bottomless so does it get better than that? The one thing we weren't impressed by is the guacamole, it was a tad on the bland side, so if Javier's can kick start it or add some of those salsa ingredients that would be fab-u-lous! Our friends got the seafood quesadillas, nachos, enchiladas and they really enjoyed all.  Now the very best part, the margaritas! Those drinks kept us coming back for more and more, we could not get enough of them. They were the perfect combo of sweet, sour, savory, right amount of tequilla, and they were the regular ones, OH EM GEE, just amazing, I'll be dreaming of them forever. Or I'll go to Cabo as the server recommended to Javier's on the beach. The service isn't the best as I would agree with some of the reviews, but they are definitely sweet people working there. We left full, happy, and tipsy. Javier's was our Aria's guilty pleasure and it is open till 2am so that's a big plus! Will definitely be back!!!",

Having been to the Newport Beach location, I can say that the food quality is as good in Vegas as the Southern Cali location. The scenery is much better at Crystal Cove, with a stunning view of the ocean, but Vegas offers the eye candy of the casino.  Simply said, the service, food and atmosphere were all great.  Yes, it is expensive, but if you want cheap Mexican go to Taco Bell.  Think about their overhead (rent, large staff to deliver great service, cost to build out a spectacular restaurant, and high quality ingredients) and adjust your expectations and you will have a great experience.",

I guess I expected a mind blowing experience and all I got was regular Mexican food. I mean, Las Margaritas does it better. But I digress. Looking back, the experience was pleasant so I have to rate it accordingly.  I bought into the hype and got the jalapeno margarita - It was exquisite! The freshness of the pepper, the underlying heat and the cool of the lime balance perfectly. I wanted to try the cucumber margarita too but I had already fallen for the sweet heat of the pepper. I had the enchiladas suizas (chicken with tomatillo sauce). It was tasty. Javier's gets the points for service and demand. So many people got denied requests for tables as I waited for my group's table to be prepared. That made me glad that I made the reservation months in advance:)",

    "text": "How does it go... \"People go to restaurants to eat, but they come back for the hospitality\" I definitely agree, hence, I will not be returning to Javier's.   As soon as we were seated I felt like our waiter didn't have the time of day us. He was rushing us through our meal, even though there was nobody waiting to be seated. In fact at the end of our meal, my husband asked to see the dessert menu and the waiter gave us our bill instead. Then when we asked him for a second time to see the dessert menu, he proceeded to verbally tell us the desserts. Maybe that was his way of telling us not to order dessert because the desserts are terrible.   For a restaurant of Javier's caliber it was a disappointment to see that they only had two mediocre desserts on their menu; deep fried ice cream and flan. Where were the churros and dulce de leche concoctions? Nonetheless, we shouldn't have ordered dessert because it was awful! Our dessert was described as 'deep fried ice cream covered in corn flakes' and we ended up getting bad quality store bought ice cream covered in corn flakes and plated in a stale deep fried shell. Horrible!  Our entrees were okay. I ended up getting the vegetarian enchiladas with tomatillo sauce and my husband got the cheese enchiladas with adobo sauce. Both were good, but nothing special so I don't see why they were $$$. Also, I don't want to be a prude but in a restaurant that is going to charge so much for a couple of enchiladas I'd expect to see beautifully plated entrees, but instead we were served NFK (nonfunctional garnishes) on our enchiladas in the form of canned olives and slices of red onion. Weird!  Overall, run of the mill Mexican food that can be found elsewhere for half of the price so don't bother dressing up and wasting your time coming to Javier's.",

    "text": "Only if my taste buds were on my eyes.  The place is astonishing! Love the white walls the dark woods the dark leather and the accent wrought iron. All in a some kind of Moroccan architecture with ogival arches and hanging ropes imitating giant draperies. There's also the largest chainsaw carved piece of art hanging on one of the walls that suppose to tell the history of the Mayans but all I saw was skeletons scattered all over, maybe it tells the Mayan present and not the past. still ....a real feast to my eyes! This is the place where you would probably find the most interesting man in the world having lunch!...... So I ordered a Dos Equis and asked for the menu.  The food.... where do I start? Oh yes! With the chips and salsa of course. The first rule to tell if a restaurant is committed to quality is with the chips. Room temperature chips = corner cutting restaurant. Warm chips = will go the extra mile for you restaurant. Well I'm happy to inform you that the chips were not only warm, they were also crispy and tasty! and that's before adding the salsa!....now to the not so great.   I was really hoping for something different on the menu since by looking at the place it is obvious that Javier wants to set himself apart from most typical Mexican restaurants but unlike the decor the menu at Javiers was as boring as any taco shop menu in town. To be fair they do serve steaks and some vegetarian items but you'll pay for that!  Yes the prices are a little bit high for a Mexican restaurant. Carne asada 50.00, filete ladrillo 60.00 filete antiguo 45.00 but like everyone else says...\"this is the strip!\".... I don't care, you just don't buy silver and pay for gold! ..oh yes, I've paid more for food before but for stuff that I couldn't pronounce and definitely not in a Mexican restaurant...call me el cheapo but I skipped those items and settled for a taco an enchilada and a chile relleno combo. Food came out kinda warm almost cold even though the plate felt hotter than the food which I didn't understand but I was hungry and it was warm enough and edible so I ate it but shouldn't be acceptable at those prices.   Service was kinda slow. I had to wait between beers and to order and the place wasn't busy at that time. I think they were saving their energy for rush hour or something. I didn't mind at the time since I wasn't in a hurry and also it gave me time to take some pictures. but at the end although I think the food is good but nothing that would make me go out of my way to get as if it was something that would go through a rolled one hundred dollar bill. I would probably try it again but only if I'm in the area.   I do have one complaint.....Javier, what's up with the music? That's the stuff you would listen to at Mariana's supermarket while pushing a shopping cart or at the broad acres swap meet while you bite into an elote. I'm sure you can come up with something a little bit more original. How about some Mana, Sin Banderas, or play some pandora....and get rid of all those eight tracks! In conclusion. This place gets 3.5 stars in my opinion. The food is decent, the place is beautiful, and so was the staff that was working at that time....if only my taste buds were on my eyes.   100th review!     *opens champagne*",

    "text": "No, you're not going to find any taco specials here. But yes, you can get your polished $20 tacos and eat it in a swank dining room.   Hate to say it, but my expectations going in were pretty low. The chatter on Javier's was  \"over-priced\" \"not worth it\" \"underwhelming\" \"not real Mexican food.\" How else was I to feel? After eating there not just once but three times, I'm happy to say that Javier's isn't so bad.  My Mexican friends are gonna kill me, but I actually like the food here! The selection isn't unique. You've got your usual meats, tacos, enchiladas, etc. Ingredients and recipes aren't creative masterpieces but the menu is easy to navigate and won't confuse you. The food tastes cleaner here--which can be expected. Meats and other ingredients are of a higher calibre and it really shows in the flavor. I can vouch for the Carne Tampiquena and the Cabo Azul. And since everyone's #1 question is \"is the Carne Asada worth it\"... No, it isn't. Not to say it isn't delicious but like kobe beef, I'm 99.9% sure its a gimmick to add intrigue. It worked on 2 of my friends so far!  Total date spot for sure. Its got the expensive, swanky feel without being overdone. The dark woods and leathers add to the luxurious ambiance but still make it warm and comfortable. The bar is under this massive rope chandelier and be sure to check out the world's largest chainsaw sculpture. It's actually pretty cool.  Service is up to fine-dining expectations and the bartenders are excellent. They've got a huge selection of tequila bordering the lines of ridiculousness. Some of them go up to $2,000. Of the ones I've tried, I highly recommend the Clase Azul. Sweet, smooth, and relatively reasonably priced at $20. I don't usually get mixed drinks, but they make a mean margarita. They run around $17 (if i remember correctly). I had one with cucumber and lime which was nice & refreshing.",

    "text": "3.5 stars if I could. Got a comp credit to this little gem inside Aria. The place ain't no taco bell, with beautiful decor and a nice \"liquor tree\". Very intimate and inviting atmosphere. This upscale-ness is certainly reflected in the price with many, entrees wavering around $20-much more than you would expect from a typical Mexican restaurant.   Free chips and salsa-Salsa was a little hot and that basket of chips was huge!  Didn't get to try any entrees since we were stuffed already from a pre-dinner. But we did get drinks and dessert.  Mango and strawberry margaritas---but their mango margarita was delicious! Blended nomnomness.    Caesar Salad-Caesar salad dressed up with little tortilla chips...Tiny, tiny portion. Not worth that dough my friends.   Also tried the flan and the fried ice cream. The flan was good, creamy and not too sweet, but I'm more used to a creamy, coffee flavored Vietnamese flan. The fried ice cream was much different than the tempura kind you find at Japanese joints. Vanilla ice cream covered in some kind of nuts in a fried bowl that was cinammon-sugar dusted.   Service was EXCELLENT. So kind and attentive. I would come back just for the service.  But that price...2 margaritas + 1 salad + 2 desserts = $60. Welcome to Vegas.",

    "text": "Went to Javier's on a whim after a long gamble at the Aria to grab some eats. Being from Texas and used to Tex-Mex I was excited to see what they had to offer. Note: I was told they have no relation to the Javier's in Dallas.  The ambiance is an old world Mexican cantina. White plaster walls and iron adorn the restaurant, while a round wooden bar sits well positioned at the entrance. The bathrooms are quite nice and have a rather chatty attendant... who isn't too intrusive but makes his presence known.  Obviously I had to try their margarita, which was great... not the best... but very good, nonetheless. The guacamole was small and perfect for two people to share. It lacked cilantro, which is a must in any guacamole I prepare myself. Good not great.  The chips and salsa were really the highlight. Very reminiscent of my childhood eating in Tex-Mex cantinas with my parents and welcome callback from my past. It's a little sweeter than most salsas, but it tasted quite fresh, I enjoyed it considerably. As I did the chips. They tasted fresh.  I had a taco enchilada platter that was very good. Everything tasted very Tex-Mex. Perfect seasoning, perfect heat, and the taste was very good.   I had seen reviews before I went that the service was very lacking. The restaurant was probably about a third full (it was early in the evening) and I was quite aware that our service may not be very good. But, I'm quite happy to report that the service was good to great.  I wish I could give it 5 stars... but it's more like a 4.5 star restaurant for me. The ambiance was a little too dark and the walls felt a little too cold and a little too bare for me. Overall, I really enjoyed the experience and the food and drink are very good quality Tex-Mex. Especially in Las Vegas. I will absolutely be returning and hope to make this a go-to spot in future Las Vegas visits.",

Dimly lit, it's a nice escape from the Aria (not that the Aria is anything to escape from) but you totally feel like you are not in Las Vegas, like LA or NYC.  Our waitress recommended the Carnitas to me.  Wow, what a dish.  Huge portion of carnitas, a piece of rib, and all the sides including guac.  Very tender and not fatty at all, which is great.  Can't stand mexican restaurants that serve non lean meat.  I also tried my friend's skirt steak.  Very tender, almost to the point that it was soft like fast food Chinese beef.  Kinda freaked me out a little, buy hey, what can you do??  As a local, I always seem to have low expectations of strip restaurants.  But, I was totally surprised.  Prices are decent, but they are well below strip prices.  (Minus the carne asada for $50)  I am actually very curious to see what that tastes like.  But I am willing to pay more since the restaurant is so eye catching, yet subtle at the same time.  Top new date spot on the strip!  5 stars all the way.",

We made a reservation for Saturday night since we were in Vegas for my bachelorette party. We often eat at the Newport location and we expected to have such a different experience. Our server only checked in with us once after we ordered and the was to tell us that our food was almost ready to come in 5 minutes. 15 minutes later one of our dishes came out. We waited to eat for the rest of my party to get food and ended up waiting 5 more minutes for 2 more plates. The remainder of our food came out 5 minutes after that. To make things worse, the food that was brought out later was cold, almost like it was sitting around waiting to be brought out. I split the La Tableta with another friend and it did taste good, but none of the other 5 girls liked their food. It tasted horrible. The manager came over and apologized but really seemed like he could care less. Later on that night one of my friends got really sick (before we even started drinking) and barely made it to the cab before she threw up her shrimp dish.   Although I love Javier's in Orange County, I will not be going to the Vegas one again. Do yourself a favor and visit a different restaurant with warmer and better food while in Vegas",

    "text": "Aria comes through yet again with another reason for me to frequent their property.  I was drawn to Javier's because of my knowledge of the Javier's in Dallas and was pretty convinced that this one in Las Vegas was somehow connected.  When I asked, I was told that they get asked that quite a bit from people in Texas but this particular Javier's is out of California and has no affiliation with the well-respected location in Dallas.  That was the only disappointment about my visit.  THIS Javier's was so enjoyable it somehow strayed me from my plan to go to the Todd English PUB afterwards, which is nearly impossible to do.  The oval-shaped bar is just off the casino floor and has plenty of seating to accomodate what was a very busy crowd, even for my visit on a Monday night.  Dining areas are immediately left, behind and right of this bar and looked intimate and unique.  I was on my own, so the bar was perfect for my needs and I enjoyed the friendly and attentive service from Felipe and Karen, who also has the perfect smile and personality to handle working with all the guys back there.   Chips and salsa were put in front of me as I ordered my drink and they are complimentary and plentiful. Other Yelpers have said the salsa is some of the best they've had in Vegas and I cannot dispute that. As a matter of fact, my eyes were watering because of the subtle heat that builds up from enjoying it.  While I went with one of their many Mexican style bottled beers, the bar is fully stocked with not only tons of tequilas but an excellent selection of other spirits. (I also appreciate when Johnny Blue is available, even though it probably does not get much action at around $42 a shot)  Thinking I would save room for some Happy Hour munchies at Todd English PUB, I ordered the taquitos appetizer and was offered chicken, beef or a combination. There were three on the plate and I was full by the time I finished them. Sadly, they may have ruined grocer's freezer taquitos for the rest of my life. Yes, that damn good.  Oh, I am not a fan of sour cream, so Felipe kindly removed it from my order which in turn meant that they drizzled even more guacamole on my taquitos. This was even better than I thought, because I could take chips and dip them in the additional guacamole and still have plenty of guac flavor to complement the taquitos.  My eyes were watering, my tummy was full and my respect for the Aria just continues to grow.",

    "text": "I was leery about Javier's at the Aria. It's Orange County namesake is a high-end, luxurious fiesta, and possibly the only Institution in a region bereft of heritage or culture. A high standard indeed, and I was wondering if Javier's had the hubris to compete with the other heavyweights on The Strip. After our huge party that was executed flawlessly by staff & kitchen, Javier's has proven to be beyond competitive, and an instant contender for best restaurant experience in Las Vegas.  We had 12 people, an instant clustermess for any restaurant, and we were seated on time on a Saturday night. The layout was spacious, and the raised ceilings allow for good acoustics, sight lines & style. Our server, Jose Luna, was one of the most efficient, professional servers with whom I've ever had the pleasure of interacting. He paced our table perfectly - no easy task at a rowdy bachelor party - without rushing us, keeping the stream of chips, surprisingly good (and spicy) table salsa, appetizers, meals and desserts at a steady clip.   Now the food? The food was just shy of excellent. Interesting, unique expressions of standard dishes with an emphasis on seafood, the sauces are a testament to the seriousness which Javier's treats it's cuisine. The Fideo Del Mar was not, as named, a True fideo noodle; that's satisfactory as the linguine was a natural vehicle for the crab, shrimp and scallop in a light tomatillo cream sauce. The carnitas were voluptuous and delicious; the asada juicy and tender with the right amount of char. Both lacked a tad bit of salt, interestingly enough, so they weren't perfect - but definitely tasty. The desserts included a deep, flavorful flan and a wonderful fried ice cream with a frightfully seductive thin layer of shell.   Worth noting specifically is the ceviche - fine, high-quality cuts of octopus, pescado (fish) and shrimp served in a piercingly acidic brine that highlights the succulence of the chemical-free, in-season seafood.  Really an outstanding meal, and worth every penny of the (relatively) high prices.",

Boyfriend had spinach enchiladas and couldn't stop talking about it. The guacamole is literally the best I have ever had.   Nice, intimate, low lights, perfect ambiance for date night.

The food is just like the other locations as you would expect.  The service is pretty good as well.  It fits nicely in Aria.  I was not too creative with my ordering.  I started out with the queso fundido as always.  I did vary a little with my order.  I ordered the beef taco plate instead of the enchilada with a taco.  Both items ordered were tasty.",

This much I will tell you, the salsa was fresh and to die for (we kept asking for more, I think it might have been complimentary which makes that fact even more greedy, but the chips were fresh and the salsa was delish so I'm pretty sure we cleaned them out).   Nevertheless, we all ordered the fajitas and none of us finished them. They were DIVINE!  We all ordered different types (I ordered beef) and everyone enjoyed their meal so much so, the girls and I were emailing about \"those good fajitas we had in Vegas\" last week, like little piggies.    Again, it was Vegas so that's all the detail I'm capable of providing due to the activities and atmosphere of said locale. You're welcome. Go there, it's good/",

    "text": "High Class Mexican food that simply does not skip on home-cooked flavor!  Chef Sosa and his team have found a way to elevate the flavors in Mexican cuisine so that it may suit the palate of any culture and or picky eaters.  Our meal started with a Trio of Ceviches, in which we chose on 2 fish and 1 octopus.  Boy did we regret not getting 2 octopus ceviches instead.  The  fish cevich is made with Halibut and is just amazing, but being Mexican and always eating fish ceviche, you kind of get used to the flavor., but the Octopus Ceviche was just beyond words delicious (hence the reason we regretted not getting 2 Octopus ceviches).  The flavors are distinct and unique but you know you are still having Mexican food.  As I sat there enjoying the Octopus I also worked on trying to figure out the ingredients to recreate at home (in my book, that is the True testament of how delicious food is).  Followed by Crispy Taco plate for my husband, which he raved about and I had the Enchilada Trio, which consisted of 1 shrimp enchilada, 1 crab enchilada, both bathed in a tomatillo sauce, and 1 lobster enchilada bathed in a creamy pasilla sauce.  I was in heaven!  We then ended our meal with one of the creamiest flans we have ever tasted and the absolute best Tres leches I have ever encountered.  We got excited to find out that we can enjoy this meal again out in Irvine, CA which is closer to us then Vegas, so we will definitely be visiting that location as well.    I must mentioned that I we also received the best service we have ever gotten in Las Vegas from Ivette A.  She and the rest of the servers were so attentive to our experience that we felt right at home.  Once more, we will definitely be visiting the other location and when in Vegas, we will be making a stop at Javier's!  Highly recommend is just not enough to explain how great the food, staff and the atmosphere is at this restaurant.",

But, with the speakers right above the bar it's louder than what you would expect, even in Vegas.   The service was great at the bar, and the bartenders keep an eye on all the seats.   For drinks the go to drink is the Banana Nut Martini, which is desert in a glass. No draft beers and the selection is small. Went with the guacamole which is not made tableside and is a small serving, but the chips are great. We had the Sabor A Provincia which is a sampler of taquitos, empanadas, quesadillas and sopas. This was filling for two.   I go down to 3 stars because it is what it is, a good restaurant in a high end casino in Vegas that charges too much.

My husband and I had previously come to this restaurant a couple of years ago and today was my fathers birthday so we decided to bring him here with the family. We waited 42 min.

While we waited for our food the server informed my father who ordered a $60 plate that included a steak, veggies and mash potatoes that they would not be able to serve him mash potatoes because the ones they had were not good. He asked if he could serve him some other type of potato dish. My father agreed. Once our food arrives my dads dish had no potatoes or mash potatoes and neither was he served anything on the side with it. After our food arrived. Our server was nowhere to be seen neither did he bother coming around to ask if everything was ok or if we needed something. He came around after we had all finishes our food. And we informed him my dads plate had no potatoes in it. And that he was also not able to eat the steamed vegetables that came with the steak because the veggies were all cold. He tried to bring us a side or warm veggies and he also brought out a side of French fries. Yes French Fries! That's where I just felt insulted the most because he ordered a $60 plate. He didn't want French fries. His expectations for plate  he ordered were  not met. And we will not be coming back to this place. Neither do we recommend anyone spending their time or money here.",

    "text": "The authentic flavors of Mexico elevated through ingredients to five star status.  Outstanding.  Quality ingredients are key.  From sustainably sourced seafood to USDA Prime beef, to the freshest produce.  It shows clearly in the simple chips and salsa they offer.  The salsa, incredibly fresh, ripe, sweet tomato, prominent flavor of chilies, herbaceous freshness of cilantro and end notes of sulfurous onion.  Made multiple times daily, it shows.  Tip:  Not all dishes are available on the lunch menu.  Ask if your heart is set on a particular dish. They may be able to accommodate you.  Incredible ceviche.  The pulpo (octopus), tender slices, whose gentle sweetness is brought out by the lime juice acidity.  Bright and refreshing.  For mains, the Chile Negro.  Two short ribs, braised until fall apart tender in a chile negro sauce.  The sauce, a complex blend of spices and chilies, permeates the beef to its core.  An acidic zing from tomato paste shines through.  Sweet, earthy, brooding, mind boggling complex.   Outstanding.  Both the mole poblano and mole verde served over bone in chicken breast are excellent.  Incredibly complex, both showing a spice earthiness.  The poblano, a hint of bitterness, and the unmistakable flavor of chilies.  The verde, a more pronounced earthiness and richness of pumpkin seeds with a slightly fresher finish of green chilies.  The top seafood dish remains the Cabo Azul.  The dish is a sampler.  A stunning Maine lobster enchilada (so named because the enchilada is stuffed full with nothing but Maine lobster) in a creamy pasilla sauce that brightens every bite.  A grilled chile relleno stuffed with jack cheese shrimp and a mountain of sweet Dungeness crab topped with a light, earthy relleno sauce.  And third, an ungodly good shrimp taco, the shrimp lightly dusted with flour and fried in clarified butter for an unexpected crispness.  Served in a warm flour tortilla on a simple bed of lettuce with sour cream.  An incredible dish.  Excellent, efficient but patient service.  Servers understand the menu can be both foreign and unfamiliar.  Let them guide you.  Outstanding, friendly and knowledgeable bar tenders.    Well chosen selection of tequila and mescal including some hard to find, rare gems.  Very well made margaritas.  The name sake Javiar, smooth, refreshing, and plenty strong to cut through any flavor and reset the palate well worth the premium price ($18).  Many repeat visits, always satisfying.  Highly recommended.",

The food was delicious and the waiter was very professional. When the check came out, I provided my M-life military status card. He brought back the check and I noticed that a military 10% discount was not applied. I asked the waiter why it wasn't applied and he just answered by saying, \"we don't give discounts\". OK, well that's not an acceptable reason. I paid my bill and found one of the managers and asked him about why Javier's didn't offer 10% military discount for M-life members at an MGM property. I have never been denied a 10% military discount at MGM properties when dining and I was a bit flabbergasted at this. The manager replied to me, \"we are not part of MGM\". Since when is a restaurant that is built into an MGM property NOT part of MGM? I don't understand that. Nor the waiter or the manager at Javier's were able to give me a valid reason as to why I was denied my military 10% discount at an MGM restaurant. I would love an answer to this question, thank you.",

It's difficult to find authentic upscale Mexican food that does not veer too far from traditional cuisine or ingredients. I believe Javier's changed that for us. Our waiter was fantastic! He was very sweet, knowledgeable, and attentive. The drinks were unique and delicious. We enjoyed everything we ordered! My father actually smiled and said, \"it's just the way I like it!\" My mom didn't say much at that moment but watching her scrape up every last piece of her desert  and finally leaning back in her chair with a huge smile...that was HUGE!

Went for lunch so no drinking involved, unfortunately, but tasty and filling nonetheless.  It was packed at lunch time on a Tuesday and for good reason.  Portion sizes are large (you are paying for them but it's Vegas) and free chips and salsa were solid.  I had the cabo azul which came with all assortments - shrimp taco, lobster and seafood empanada, shrimp-stuffed pepper, and beans and rice.  Also, the house habanero hot sauce is a must.  The shrimp taco was just quality all around.  Basic ingredients, but the shrimp had an unbelievable crunch and the soft taco was perfectly fresh.  The pepper itself was fine but again the shrimp innards were just fantastic - some of the best quality seafood I've had in a while.  The empanada was as good as it sounds.  Fresh seafood in a butter-like skin.  Each dish had its own sauce as well which made the plate colorful and added even more punch and flavor to each bite.  The meal was fantastic and well worth the $35 price tag.  Javier's is solid for meal or just to have a notorious margarita.  Great spot if you're looking for a Vegas Mexican experience.",

With that, we were seated VERY quickly, and were immediately greeted by a fantastic server. The chips and salsa was ALWAYS flowing onto our table, one after another. The margaritas (both house and jalepeno) were FANTASTIC. The food was 'okay'...maybe not the most \"authentic\" but it was still good. I had the spinach enchiladas - I felt like there was maybe just too too much spinach and it had a very wet taste to it. Maybe adding some cheese would have made it better.

Top notch service and food, excellent atmosphere, unique dishes. What more could you ask for? Maybe for it to be a little cheaper? Haha... good luck. But in the frame of reference for the prices of restaurants on the strip and in high end hotels... this place was fairly reasonable, and the food justified the cost.  The meal started off with some of the best chips and salsa I've ever had. The chips were crisp and flavorful, balanced out by fresh salsa with just the right amount of spice. We ordered some chori-queso dip to go with them, and that was amazing too... delicious cheese and tasty chorizo.  For my meal, I had a seafood trio of sorts. A lobster enchilada, a crab chile relleno, and a shrimp taco. The taco actually stole the show, filled with very large juicy shrimp, topped with a tasty sauce and fresh fillings that complemented it all perfectly. This isnt to say that both the enchilada and chile weren't awesome as well, I just didnt expect the one item that I have had elsewhere before to be my favorite of the three. I used the bottomless chips to scrape up every last remnant from my plate.  Other dishes around the table included some very tasty skirt steak fajitas and a southwestern creamy linguine dish with shrimp that all also received high marks from those eating them.  I would definitely recommend Javier's to anyone staying at or near the Aria, even for the price listed. The food quality/amount, and the service you receive are all in line with the top dollar you are paying.",

My first experience at a Javier's was in Cabo San Lucas at the Cabo Azul Resort and Spa and I have always been a big fan. The food was delicious and added a special touch to Valentines Day with my honey. They got us in last minute for a 10:30pm reservation. Originally we were going to a steakhouse downtown and changed our minds due to the rainy weather. We had the filet medium well and it just melted in our mouths like butter. It was accompanied on a bed of cooked spinach and baby potatoes and carrots. The white rice was seasoned to perfection and very good. He had the seared scallops and they were equally amazing. The white sauce drizzled on the top added some extra flavor. The chips and salsa were fresh and delicious as well. Love this place",

I always loved coming to dinner or even lunch here before hitting the strip! This place has the best filling food and the best drinks! They also do reservations for only 2 people which is prime! The location is a little small, but it never feels crowded and the workers are always helping someone out! I would definitely get the pepino (cucumber) margarita! This location also plays good music and they have the sports on in the bar area!",

We usually make reservations, but were not sure how late we would be due to traffic, so we took a chance and WOW!  The very nice wait staff told us it would be an hour wait or we could sit in the bar area, which does have some low loungey tables behind the main bar.  Not a seat to be found!  We circled around and decided to come back later, which is this review.   We arrived around 130pm, this time with a reservation and a request for a booth, and our late lunch strategy got us right next to the huge Popul Vuh carved wall sculpture.  Our waiter was extremely friendly and I ordered a Cadillac Margarita, with Silver Patron and Grand Marnier!  Brilliant drink arrived almost immediately!  We were hungry, and ordered from the lunch menu, which is the same as the dinner menu, using our phones to provide some additional light.     I got shrimp tacos with white rice and black beans, and my honey got a combination plate with a chicken enchilada and chicken taco with Spanish rice and beans.  We devoured our meal with relish, the tacos were warm and the enchilada tasty.  We enjoyed the quiet of the late afternoon, and boxed up half the portions to take home.  A very relaxing and refreshing afternoon.",

This year, we finally decided to make dinner reservations here, and were so happy we did. For dinner, I chose the Javier's chopped salad with grilled chicken. The salad had avocado, red onion, tomato, cucumber, sweet corn, jack cheese, and was tossed with a nice light champagne vinaigrette. It was delicious and tasted very fresh. I also had the sangria, which was very good, and not overly sweet. Before our food came out, our waiter brought over some complimentary chips and salsa. I think my boyfriend and I polished off almost all of them!! My boyfriend's dinner were the 'melt in your mouth' steak fajitas. The steak that Javier's uses is angus prime skirt steak, and I wished I had ordered the same dish after I tried a bite (and I am not a steak person). If you opt for the fajitas, they come with a nice side of refried beans, guacamole and sour cream. Javier's is a little more expensive than your typical Vegas dinner, but as it was our last evening in Vegas, we splurged and were so glad we did. Props to our waiter, Oscar, who was very helpful in all of his suggestions and who took great care of us.",

We followed this up with traditional mex dishes, Costa del Rey- osco busso in spices tomato and the chile Colorado, both at the servers recommendation. The dishes were delectable. This the first place I've eaten pinto beans from scratch and it was fabulous! The rice and beans both had hints of chicken broth and herbs, pair this with the warm succulent meat bathing in spiced tomato and you have a meal to remember. The service was spectacular . We got both dishes at the servers recommendation and he did not steer us wrong. All in all, a good place to enjoy some good food , bring your own lighting.",

I ate lighter fare, but for my customers who had never tried great Mole, their Mole with a steak was quite the hit. There are pages of items to choose from and it's pretty much guaranteed everyone will enjoy their food.  Their chips and salsa are always wonderful as is the table side guacamole. We had to have seconds on chips. Their handmade margaritas are great.   I still like the Newport Coast location the best because of the view, but this location is way better than the Irvine Spectrum! Prices are very reasonable.",

    "text": "There is something about going to an authentic little Mexican spot that passes down Grandmas recipes and you savor every bite.  Whether they have folded some paper napkins, or the server even speaks a word of English- you feel like you have been invited in as a guest and treated to a tasty dinner at often very low prices.  Now, if you are to take this wonderful experience and have admittedly some very nice tables and seating and throw fancy decorations on the wall, with mostly unauthentic servers, and have the same menu items at double or triple what it would normally cost AND your food doesn't taste near as good: that is what I experienced at Javier's.  At the end of the day I want to savor every bite.  I ordered the tampiquena- a dish I have had before and absolutely loved at a family owned higher end place near Philadelphia, and I can't even compare the two honestly.  I tried a bite of a friends burrito and it was average at best.  Save your money if you're in the mood for Mexican in Vegas, and skip Javier's.",

The service is impeccable and the food is outstanding! The decor is amazing, lots of skulls, but they are hidden in a not in your face kind of way. We ordered a couple margaritas and one was better than the other. I liked the jalapeno one the best! We ordered a tuna ceviche for appetizer and it was outstanding, very fresh and very delicious! For our main course we ordered the Carnitas and Cabo Azul ( lobster enchilada, crab chili relleno & shrimp taco). The carnitos were the best I ever had, crunch on the outside, moist on the inside. The seafood was very fresh and i can't even decide which one was better.  If you are ver in Vegas, this place is a MUST to check out!",

We received great service, the setting was very dim and romantic, and the food overall was good!  Started off with the Complimentary Chips and Salsa. So easy to get this wrong...but Javier's does it right!     Ceviche de Camaron ($18). Great ceviche...just spendy. Some of the best ceviche I've had was only $3-5 and served in a plastic cup...this doesn't fare much better esp for the money.   Shredded Beef Taquitos ($10): Avocado Sauce, Cotija Cheese, Sour Cream, Radish, Onion & Cilantro. There were 3 rolls here...pretty good!  Not sure if I would order them again though.  Eva went with the Cabo Azul ($30): Maine Lobster Enchilada in Creamy Pasilla Sauce, Grilled Chili Relleno with Monterey Jack, Shrimp and Dungeness Crab in Relleno, and Shrimp Taco Ensenada style. Lots going on here...everything was good, but I think the SHRIMP TACO was actually the best choice here.  Surprising I know!  I went with the Carnitas ($25): Michoacan style Pork served with Refritos, Guac, Salsa Quemada, Grilled Green Onions & Cilantro. This was delicious! SUPER flavorful carnitas...I've never had it like this before!  This dish would be highly recommended :P  Easily the most I've spent on Mexican food, but given the location, setting, flavor and service, it is a memorable dinner on the strip!",

    "text": "For a city where everything is bigger, the portions were surprisingly on point at this establishment.   The bartender was very forthcoming in letting me know what his favorite salad was which turned out to be a great recommendation, and he also recommended a reasonably priced aNejo tequila to sip on, which I appreciated.   The salad that was recommended was the Ensalada de Salpicon. The ingredients were really simple, and I was afraid perhaps too simple, but when it arrived, it was perfectly seasoned. The chicken was marinated as well as the cabbage itself and shredded, not wedges of cabbage as I was afraid it would be (you know how sometimes presentation is so focused on the aesthetic value that to eat it takes a village - it wasn't the case here).   The tequila also turned out to be delicious. I asked for a nice, sipping tequila and hoped for one that wouldn't cost me $50, and the Azunia Anejo came highly recommended, and throughout the meal, deeply enjoyed (yes, my feeling about tequila can come off as sexual).   Even though this was the most expensive $^&%&^$ cabbage I've ever had, I know it's Vegas, and needless to say, I wouldn't expect them to leave money on the table when everyone is charging really expensive prices. That's the only reason they didn't 5 stars (cause they weren't a \"bargain\").   If you like Mexican Food but can't make it down to Diablo's or wait for 20 hours to get seated, Javier's offers a chic and trendy experience with modern Mexican cuisine that's not ostentatious or overly priced.",

    "text": "Javiers usually provides a great food experience at thier other locations. In my opinion, don't waste your time even considering the Las Vegas location. It ranks far below the quality and service standards of the other Javiers locations. I've been to several of Javiers locations including Newport Beach, Irvine, and Las Vegas.   My favorite dishes are the Cabo Azul, and the Mole Poblano. I also usually splurge on a few tamarind margaritas as well.  I have had these dishes often enough to know when they are prepared properly and when the kitchen is cutting corners.  On this visit my wife decided to split the Cabo Azul. It is described as: \"A Maine lobster enchilada in a creamy pasilla sauce, a grilled chile relleno stuffed with Monterey Jack cheese, shrimp and fresh Dungeness crab topped with a light relleno sauce, and a shrimp taco on a flour tortilla prepared Ensenada style. Served with refried black beans and white rice.\"  When we got the dish, we were starved, even though we stuffed our faces with far too many chips with salsa. The dish was not as hot as it usually is. We just figured it sat under the warming lamps too long as the service was a little slow. We decided I would eat the shrimp taco, her the lobster enchilada and we would split the Chile Relleno. We also had 3 Tamarind Maragaritas at $18 a piece.  While we were eating the waitress came by to see how things were. Even though thedish wasn't as hot as I expected, I was fine with it and gave her an 'it's fine' grunt just wanting her to go away.  I grunted too soon. When my wife and I got to splitting the \"grilled chile relleno stuffed with Monterey Jack cheese, shrimp and fresh Dungeness crab topped with a light relleno sauce\" I was immediately disappointed. It was very difficult to cut the chile, as it cold and wasn't cooked at all. I managed to saw off a section and give it a try anyway. There was little to no cheese, the shrimp were no where to be found, the fresh Dungeness crab resembled and tasted like imitation Krab meat, and the sauce tasted like Cambells mushroom soup. I got the impression that they had a pile of ungrilled split Chiles in the kitchen where the chef grabs an icr cream scoop full of Krab filling and flings inside the Chile, spills some muchroom soup over it and trys to pass it off as Cabo Azul. Pure crap.   We complained to our waitress about that portion of the dish (when in reality it was all pretty much sub-par). She took our plates away, no doubt destroying the evidence. She returned again in a little while with our bill that had no adjustment for the crappy chile relleno. She was suprised that we expected something and meekingly squeaked that she thought the manager had already come by. So she scurried off to get the manager (again).   We waited what seemed like an eternity until 2 managers came by to set us straight about the order. There was a snooty middle-aged blonde woman and a young concern-feigning hispanic gentleman riding shotgun. She proceeded to scold us over not calling out the problem with the food when the waitress came by the first time (roughly 2 minutes after she set the plates down), and that we had ate some of the meal so it must have been good for us at the time. In her mind we were supposed to inspect and taste each portion of the plate and be ready sign a contract of acceptance moments after being given our meal. When we pointed out that might be a tad unreasonable, the hispanic gentleman explained that he would adjust the bill for that portion of the meal. Lets do some quick math and see what a reasonable person would expect. In Las Vegas the Cabo Azul is $36. Its made up of a Lobster Enchilada, a Dungeness Crab Chile Relleno, and a Shrimp Taco.  I would value them as Lobster: 14, Relleno 12, Taco 10.  They managed to give us a $6 credit.  We've been to this location twice now. Like I said, the others are far superior. There are far too many other places to go to in Las Vegas that take pride in thier meal preparation to ever bother going here again.",

Javier's is innovative in their food flavors as well and at the same time very traditional and example of that is the Poblano Enchiladas with Lobster meat , really LOBSTER in an enchilada? GENIUS simply GENIUS. The service was ok, the server was not as attentive as I would of hoped but perhaps it was because my party was not as dressed up as all the other people there.",

Again, fine, but different than billed.  It was also overcooked and dry.  Menu is lengthy.  Too lengthy.  Bartender was terrible.  Lacked knowledge of the menu, and was too busy for her capabilities, even though the bar area was less than 50% capacity.  Leaves a lot to be desired compared to the Laguna and Crystal Cove CA., locations.  With so many choices in Vegas, I would not go out of my way to eat here.

About half way thru the meal the manager lead a large group of party goers to four hastily pushed together tables. Not an unusual event for Vegas. The problem however was that the first wave of customers was followed more waves of loud intoxicated foul mouthed folks who were just left to mill around to piss and moan about not having a place to sit. The management had no answer and the mini mob stood about for over half an hour.  Our table was soon eyeballed as part of the solution to managements problem and we were aggressively serviced by table cleaning bus help who hovered close by.  This is not a first class restaurant it is a poorly managed over priced fast food operation.  No control on the seating process and expect to be treated like a credit card transaction not a valued customer.",

Lastly, the music was so loud! We couldn't talk and hear one another or your own thoughts. When we asked if they could turn down the music the server rudely stated that they don't do that here. When we asked someone else they stated when they are busy they turn the music louder. We were shocked!

We weren't very sure if it's the same Javier's as the one in Irvine, Ca.    So we decided to stop by just in case it is  because we love the one in Irvine.  Indeed it was, and boy are we glad we stopped by.    They have the best spicy salsas in this universe, not to mention, the best carnitas.   The service was on par and the restaurant is immaculate.  Probably the cleanest restroom I've ever seen at a restaurant.  It's a little pricy, but it's worth every penny.   Yay! One more great place to look forward to dine at whenever we are in Vegas.    Tips:  If you can't handle too much spicy, becareful, the Salsas is pretty spicy.  And I eat pretty darn spicy.

    "text": "Javier's is located on the casino floor at the Aria Hotel and Casino lobby level, just steps away from Alibi Bar and the hotel's tower room elevators! From the moment we got there, and before even entering Javier's, just standing there my initial thought was \"Now this is one hip, trendy, happening place!\"  Its' locale is perfect in the heart of the Aria! The ambiance is beautiful! The restaurant is warm, welcoming and inviting! This is a great place for fine Mexican food, or just hanging out with friends while having cocktails! The restaurant can get a bit loud, but then again it is Vegas, and situated on the casino floor! It is the perfect place for mingling, or even meeting new friends!  The dress attire is casual, however, this is Vegas! Most of the guys were wearing coats or dressed very trendy or stylish, just like Javier's! And the women? Dressed to impress and looking good all around!  We did not get a chance to dine here, since we had dinner earlier in the evening elsewhere, however, we were there for after dinner cocktails and just hanging out with, and meeting new friends in the process! Always a good thing! One thing led to another and a \"few cocktails\" led to a lot of cocktails! Teehee.... It's a good thing our room elevators are only skips away at the tower elevators! Hehe ;)  The next time I am at the Aria, I will surely look forward to dining here, as I have heard nothing but really good reviews as well as by word of mouth! I am already looking forward to my next Las Vegas trip and looking forward to returning to Javier's! Updated review on my dining experience forthcoming on my next visit! :)  There are ample parking in the Aria hotel parking lot, either by valet or self-park. Next time you are staying or passing through The Aria, be sure to check out Javier's!",

Sitting at the bar, you can easily view the decor ropes traveling up to the ceiling depicting a black hole gravity model.  Viewing the faraway sports screen would require binoculars- but that's ok.  It's a low light atmosphere with music that works well with a date or colleagues.  The reason for docking stars is the carnitas plate.  I was expecting a moist clump of pork.  What I got was mountain-pass wind-blown pork with a shell like a crab.  Drill into it and you will find trace amounts of moisture at its core.  I suppose I could soak the pork in my glass of water to simulate freshness.  It would look cool being magnified with the fork and all.  Someone should try this and post a picture.",

(Can't get over their salsa...!) my favorite items to get is their Ceviche trio, shrimp tacos! Their pineapple margaritas is also refreshing and delicious! Their hosts however can use some training in friendly customer service when you call to make reservations, and time to time some of the hosts can act very snobby!",

Very busy up-beat vibe and nice servers. We ordered the chicken fajitas and they were delicious! Ordered them again the second time! Removed a star due to not being able to get a table even when we called to book early on. But that's a good problem to have right? Will definitely be returning next time I'm in Vegas.

This place was amazing!! I LOVE me some good margaritas but boy good ones are hard to come by. Usually two sweet for my liking. These were perfect!! I loved the cucumber and the jalapeno margarita! Chips and salsa were out of this world. My hubby & I shared the combo sampler plate (I forgot what it was called) and I wish I was still hungry because I wanted to eat more food but I was so full!! Hands down best Mexican restaurant I have ever been to. This prices were a little on the higher side but reasonable in my opinion for the quality you are getting. Our service was absolutely amazing too. I hope the one in Irvine is as good because I need this in my life and don't want to have to go to Vegas to get it!",

We ordered guacamole . I've had better guacamole out of a plastic container from a grocery store. You'd think a high end Mexican restaurant would know how to make guacamole. I ordered Carnitas. It was very good. My wife and friends ordered tacos and enchiladas . They all commented there food was average. Service was so-so. Not great but not bad.

The best thing about the meal was the pineapple margarita which had WAY too much ice so you only got 4 or 5 slurps through the straw and I'm not a regular drinker.  Ha!  We mentioned there was a birthday at the table and not even a scoop of complimentary ice cream.  I would go back for drinks possibly if I was in the Aria but I wouldn't make it a point to go there.  The cafe inside of Cardenas supermarket is way better.  Extremely overpriced for Mexican food, but the atmosphere is gorgeous..",

Spoke to manager and he needed to speak to server first and I completely understand that. Clearly makes sense. Unfortunately,  no result or phone call back. This is a casino so the cameras will prove it...... A complete waste of money. Did I mention 6 to 8 employees passed by, setting tables, removing dishes, etc and nothing.. Billy, your service skills are absolutely terrible. (on receipt the name is as cashier, hopefully it is and if not I am sorry. If not, your computer system needs updates). Will not visit again. :(  Update - Called from room to manager that night and told he would call back. Wait for it.....next day and still no contact by management.",

Traditional Javier's margarita on the rocks-hit the spot--$18 worth of thirst quencher, party starter!  Chambord margarita was too sweet for my friend, but I willingly traded for my second traditional.   Why the 3 star rating, you ask.  Well, the food was not good.  5 soft tacos on a plate for $24--tried 2 beef, 2 chicken, 1 pork.  Dry, flavorless, even with adding cabbage and small amount of guac, which was provided on the side.  Go for drinks.  Bar had nice, energetic atmosphere.  Others seemed to like dinner, so maybe that's better than our one sampling.",

One, the place is beautiful, the hostesses were very nice and the bartender made my drinks just right. Two, when we finally got a table I walked thru checking out the decor which was fab!!! And Three, my meal was freaking fantastic and so was everyone else's meal who dined with me! I saw nothing but clean plates at the end of the meal. I ordered the Fineo Del Mar which was a linguine with seafood in a creamy pinkish sauce which was perfectly spicy! The shrimp and scallop were beautifully grilled and the green onion added perfect flavor. The waiter told me it would be DELISH and he was dead on! Our waiter was really great and really sweet and he kept telling me how good I smelled ;-). So needless to say, I spent a week in Vegas for work and really didn't get to eat out until my last night in town and I am so happy we chose Javier's! What a treat after a rough work week. Hey! You gotta check this place out!",

At 8:45, we inquired about our table and we were told that it would be another 15 minutes. At 9:00, we inquired again about our table and we were told it would be a \"minute or two.\" At 9:15, we inquired again and we were told we were \"next up\" on the list.   At this point we gave up and went to a local favorite called Firefly. We were seated immediately, the service was awesome and the food was just as great!

It was packed on a Friday nite, but a great place to enjoy some authentic and Mexican fusion dishes on the strip.   The cocktails were solid, and the food tasty, but like most Strip located joints, prices were a bit pricey.   Overall, the atmosphere and ambiance makes paying for a $18 margarita worth the squeeze.   Portions are a bit on the smaller size, so if you have a big appetite, you've got 3 choices.   1- eat a late lunch.  2- pick up some Cosmo Hidden Pizza next door afterwards.  3- double up on the dishes.  In the end, you can't lose!",

The food and drinks were incredible - every enchilada and fajita at our table was delicious and flavorful. But the margaritas were the highlight - from spicy, to fruity, to on the rocks, to frozen, all of them were made to perfection.   The one downfall was that our waitress was extremely overwhelmed and did not provide the best service - we understood it was packed, but we ordered apps and tequila shots that often never arrived. We had to continually remind her after long lengths of time, and she seemed quite forgetful. That was slightly frustrating at an upscale restaurant.   Overall, I recommend, but consider going at an off time!",

Our bar tender immediately came over with menus and chips and salsa. We put some drink orders in while we perused the menu.  The chips and salsa were so yummy which got me excited to order food. I ordered the carnitas and my better half ordered the carne asada. The food was soooooooo good I literally could not stop eating. The meat fell off the bones and was so delicious!!! The carne asada was perfectly cooked and also so incredibly yummy.  The only thing that stops me from giving this place 5 full stars is simply because this place is slightly over priced for cocktails even for Vegas. Come here for the food before the drinks. Would definitely go back!",

The ambiance is high energy as the casino floor is so close yet the mood is comfortable with low lighting.  The bar greets you with a great selection of tequilas. My biggest complaint was the weak pours in the Margaritas. A couple people in our group complained they were not feeling the buzz after two rounds of margaritas and I agreed. Why be stingy on $18 cocktails?!  The mood and ambiance make this the top high end Mexican eatery on the strip. The food doesn't disappoint. We had table side guacamole, fajitas, enchiladas, tacos and chopped salad. Everything was fresh and delicious.   The service was friendly but a bit slow. We were trying to make a show and asked for expedited service. They struggled to accommodate and butchered two guests orders. Oops! I personally received a chicken taco when I ordered beef. No biggie it was still good.  Will happily come back as I have already returned several times. Javier's don't be scared to share your tequila, $20 margarita drinkers tend to know their stuff and expect a kick!!",

The Newport Beach location is one of my favorites for people watching too. I've never seen so much plastic surgery or exotic cars in one restaurant.   Putting that aside, be sure to try their tacos as they are my favorite.",

Prices are high - and there is an additional fee tacked on (couldn't tell if is was a partial resort fee but definitely and extra tax) and soda is served in small bottles so like every other Vegas restaurant wanting more than one pop costs you.   I had the 2 shredded beef crispy taco lunch with refried beans (lard is used in them) and rice, with a side of guac (not listed on menu so no idea of price until bill comes) and the husband had chile verde (came with side of rice/beans and his choice of corn or flour tortillas-he chose the latter). My tacos were yummy, the guac was good (not spicy and a good contrast to the spicy salsa that is served with the chips) and the husband enjoyed his meal.   My taco lunch was $18 and his chile verde was around $24. Each Diet Coke (3 in total I think) were $4 each and then add the guac and service fee and lunch was $75 before tip.  Aside from the price, this was the best part of The Aria Hotel.",

    "text": "Javier's is not \"all fluff with no substance\".  In fact it's quite the opposite when it comes down to it.   We came as pre-booked large party of 19 of us.  There was some confusion in our reservation and the Manager (I failed to get his name) was a complete gentleman and professional about it, and accommodated us in the large private room without any additional ordering minimums.  AAA++ to the restaurant manager for this.  The food was excellent.  I tend to gravitate away from \"fancy\" Mexcian restaurants because I'm of the garden variety type street food lover.  You know, the whole in the wall type of restaurant that usually gets much acclaim and fanfare for being such?  Well, this place proved me wrong.  In all its glory it's appropriately located in a modern and upbeat Vegas casino in the center-side of the casino floor.   The warm, thin sliced, house made tortilla chips combined with the fresh made salsa never disappoints with a salt-brimmed margarita, exotic cocktail, or brown bottled Mexican beer.  They're addicting as usual, so don't over eat on first seating.  You'll want to save room for your main course.  A party of 19 will obviously yield many dishes amongst the group.  Everything from dishes of mole, carne asada, dishes of the sea, and your traditional recipes.  It was an overwhelming sentiment of two thumbs up for all the wonderful flavors and dishes. I decided to have the special of the day - the Sea Bass which was the best Sea Bass I've ever had.  Poached? Steamed? I forgot to ask the waiter/chef but it was phenomenal.  Really.   Service was impeccable for our group.  Attentive, respectful, and the right dose of care.  I'd definitely come back here - for everything -  food/drinks/ambiance/meal.",

If you are looking for some real Mexican food in a beautiful setting Javier's is your place.  Make no mistake, Javier's is probably one of the more pricey Mexican restaurants in town. Average plate runs upwards of $30 but don't expect to eat for less at a sit-down restaurant on the strip let alone Aria. The menu is extensive with a large selection of seafood entrees and vegetarian dishes. There really is something for everyone and the combo plates allow you to sample a wide variety of dishes. I recommend the stuffed relleno peppers and guacamole, the lobster enchiladas are also extremely popular. On a side note: no free refills on soft drinks, $6 for a small 11 ounce bottle. SMH!  Rest assured your money is going somewhere: the restaurant. Javier's is gorgeous. Big props to their interior designer. The white stone with dark wood, leather tables, massive wood carvings and a beautiful bar all come together to make it one of the best looking restaurants on the strip. The restaurant is huge, probably the biggest in City Center and you can see the attention to detail in every square inch.",

Chips and salsa to start were probably the best I've ever had. My mom got the Enchiladas Pueblos and I got the Enchiladas Poblanas. They were delicious and exactly what I was hoping for. I wish we had been a bigger party to experience some of the apps.   Everything was pretty pricey but in Vegas it's expected now. I'd say Javier's was worth the $$$.

To sum it up, you could go to your favorite Mexican joint, ask them to cut the serving size by 1/3, double the price, give you yesterday's stale taco shells, and ignore you all night, and you'd have about the experience I did at Javier's. We had to ask three different people to refill our waters, and we waited about 20 minutes for someone to come by after we asked for the check.

The last two times here, I waited 45 minutes for food to come out. I have no idea why it takes so long. I wasn't here on a weekend either. The first time it happened, we just walked out after paying for our drinks. We told the manager and he tried to get us to stay but it felt like it was because he didn't want to throw away the food that was being made. Last night it happened again. I ordered the Chile Colorado which was a thick piece of pork chop. After waiting 40 minutes, we asked our server what was taking so long, and he came back with some excuse that this particular dish takes this long to cook. Five minutes later, our food came out and both of our dishes were almost cold. That just tells me that it's been sitting for a while and it was forgotten. We had the manager come over this time and he apologized and offered us replacement dishes. I wanted to leave, but my friend was hungry so we agreed. Magically, this time it took 7 minutes to come out. Maybe I was still pissed off, but it didn't taste that great after all. At least it was hot.  The reason why I'm giving two stars instead of one is because the manager ended up comping our meal for our bad experience. I still don't know if I want to come back again. At the prices that Javier's charges, I expect nothing short of exceptional service. Not poor excuses. Since this was twice in a row that this happened to me, I'm thinking that this may be a regular thing here.",

Our check was more than $700 and all of us were seriously disappointed. :(  Please don't go to Javier's if you want to have a good dinner experience.   Also I have to say that not everything was horrible... their drinks are good.",

    "text": "Beautiful ambiance, excellent service, fantastic drinks, but for all vegetarians out there, your options here are limited, unless you want bland enchiladas.  Came here after reading the amazing reviews of this restaurant.  I also saw some tasty-sounding veg options on their menu in the form of enchiladas, salads, and guac!  I ordered (a couple of) the jalapeno margaritas...wow...so delicious. I have had very few of these that have been memorable and the ones at Javier's are spectacular.  My gal pal ordered a martini and enjoyed it as well.  We split the guac and I asked for some spicier salsas with the complimentary chips; I really liked the roasted tomato one that was brought...mmm!  For my main course, I was excited to go with the spinach enchiladas but our server, Andrew, kindly pointed out that if I am a pure vegetarian, the pasilla sauce had some meat stock in it. He offered to have the refried beans (that also had meat stock) to be substituted for the vegetarian black beans (which I thought was a great idea) and he said he could sub out the pasilla sauce for a tomato-based sauce. I asked if the tomatillo sauce that was on the other veg enchilada could be used instead but he said that had meat stock as well.  I trusted his judgment and appreciated being told about the meat stock and him having a plan in place to make sure I could still enjoy; however, when the entree arrived, it was not that great. The sauce was boring (like something I have had at a mediocre fast food joint). I ended up putting the roasted tomato salsa that I received with the chips on it to give more flavor.  I also doused some of our appetizer guac on the enchiladas as well.  Considering my entree was $22 (and our bill, in general, was pricey), I expected True flavor from here.  I was really disappointed in what was brought in front of me for my main course.  I don't blame Andrew at all. I think he was fantastic, but I do think Javier's needs to provide some tasty veg options or at least better veg sauces for the enchilads.  I felt somewhat cheated coming here.  I enjoyed my drink(s), the chips, the guac, and the roasted tomato salsa, but my enchiladas sucked.  I'm glad my gal pal really enjoyed her steak fajitas, though, but I'm not surprised because definitely the restaurant caters to meat-eaters.    I come to Vegas quite a bit and I love the Aria, but I am not sure if I would come to Javier's again for food... I'm hoping the menu changes to cater to all diets but until that time...I would prolly only come here for the jalapeno margarita and some guac.",

We were playing the nearby slots for approximately 30 minutes and they never sat another party at the table we had occupied. We are bringing our employees back to Vegas next weekend and we're going to bring them to Javier's, but after this, we will no longer come back.",

Chips and salsa here are above any chips and salsa I've had at other restaurants externally fresh and delicious  The service is seriously my favorite in all of Las Vegas extremely professional and very kind people! Seriously  every time I'm in Las Vegas I have to eat here. Other than that there quesadillas are great and the enchiladas are amazing! Very posh environment and love the decor.

    "text": "I went to Javier's last night before seeing Zarkana and I'm so glad I did.  After reading Rod U.'s review, I knew the Cabo Azul would be what I'd order.  I was seated promptly without reservation and I was soon brought water, iced tea, and chips with salsa.  I had a few minutes to study the menu once again--I really didn't have to--when the server came back to take my order.  The chips were warm and the salsa had a good flavor with lots of cilantro flavor and a small amount of bite.  The Cabo azul is a mixed seafood plate with a (1) grilled chile relleno stuffed with Dungeness crab, shrimp, and jack cheese, (2) a lobster enchilada in pasilla sauce, and (3) a shrimp taco served in a soft flour tortilla that's been slightly grilled.  The dish was wonderful!  It's a great selection of seafood.  There was no skimping on any of the fillings.  The enchilada had great tasting lobster.  The crab and shrimp in the chile relleno was plentiful, and the grilled shrimp in the taco were excellent!  The dish also had black beans and rice.  The chile wasn't hot at all.  Although I like hot peppers, I think it would have detracted from the crab and shrimp.  For dessert, I went with their fried ice cream which was standard and good.  Service was excellent.  My iced tea was refilled without asking, plates were cleared quickly, and a manager came by two times to see how things were and once to chat about the heat or lack of the chile.  The room is really nicely done with different decorations including a wall of carved wood that is quite interesting (see other peoples' photos).  This is a place I'll revisit!",

We had a reservation for 3 people and still had to wait about 30 minutes after our reservation for seating. The restaurant is absolutely gorgeous and I loved our booth and the ambiance. My favorite part of the whole evening was the chips and salsa. Damn that salsa was good and it kept getting hotter and hotter each time they brought it out.   The guacamole was nothing to write home about - bland and tasted like it was just made. My personal preference is guacamole that has had time to let the flavors meld together. My carne asada quesadilla was also bland although the steak was tender. The quesadillas at Taco Bell contain more flavor than this one. The house margarita was eh and it took forever for us to finish our drinks because they just weren't that good. None of us loved our dishes. My friend who ordered the seafood enchilada only got about 3 pieces of seafood.   Definitely disappointed after all the hype and wouldn't go back, unless it was for chips and salsa.",

Skeletal figures depicting the Spanish inquisition of Mexico's Aztec/spanish war.  Grizzly and thrilling to say the least.

    "text": "I was craving tacos, so after reading mixed reviews I decided to try Javier's. The decor and ambiance were super cool, and the service was great. I ordered the shrimp tacos which came with refried bean and arroz. The meal came with two tacos that were surprisingly bland and small. The arroz was hard and not very good. I ended up ordering an additional crunchy beef taco that was so tough, so I ended eating half of it with a fork. However, we also ordered the skirt steak fajitas that were flavorful and delicious. The menu is lengthy and diverse, but somewhat overwhelming. I would recommend staying away from the tacos and taking advantage of any of their other items which seemed to be better.",

    "text": "My server Suzanne made my experience at Javier's a bad one.  She was friendly at first.  She asked if it was our first time and since it was she explained the menu and gave some recommendations which we really appreciated.  My husband ordered the organica margarita which was delicious!  I'm a martini fan so I ordered the banana because it was a new flavor to me.  It was way too sweet.  When I told Suzanne I didn't like it she said \"we'll I could've told you it was sweet!\" With a really snarky attitude.  She should have mentioned that when I ordered it because in general martinis aren't sweet and she knew it was our first visit.  She reluctantly took the martini and brought me a margarita.  From that point our service got really slow.  We saw her hopping from table to table taking orders and what not but bypassed us for a good 30 minutes before taking our food order.  We ordered but decided to share since we weren't very hungry.  She gave a big sigh when we said we were going to share.  I really felt like it was a big put down.  We were in the restaurant over an hour before our food came.  The only time we saw Suzanne was when she came to say she was going on break.  Another very sweet and friendly waitress brought us our check.  We were still charged for the martini!  I have NEVER been to a restaurant that still charged for something that was sent back.  With the attitude that she had though, it was no surprise.  I am a super tipper usually but in this case I paid for the martini instead of leaving her a tip.",

The dish was not as specify on the menu ,portion not match the price.  I called the manager to complain, the manager decided to do absolutely nothing about it or even accommodate us or give us a substitute dish or compensation of dessert or anything in that matter. My experience with Javier is that the manager named \"Leah\" definitely unexperienced and should not be a manager, she needs to look for a different type of job where she does not give  customer service. Even more disappointing is that this place is at the Aria Hotel where it's a five-star hotel where you would expect to have a five star restaurants with a five-star customer service.  Hope this review helps others who would be experiencing Javier restaurant.",

But after asking for a $16+ vodka soda, which I explained to the bartender was flat, and he disagreed stating if he made me a new drink he would need to charge 2x, I was infuriated before I even sat down.  Once at the table, our waiter was much nicer.  However, I asked at length for the salmon to be rare to medium rare that I ordered, and it arrived close to well done.  The waiter also recommended this dish to me, which was disappointing because it lacked flavor and tasted like rubber (and was over $40).  Eventually he removed the salmon from our group's bill, but overall the experience wasn't great.  Definitely would not recommend Javier's.",

Sadly, this time (1/3/19), my wife got extremely ill after dinner and had terrible food poisoning. Made a report w Aria and Javiers. Aria said - \"this is between you and the restaurant.\" - disappointment #1. Then Javiers calls me and basically said \"your wife didn't get sick from our food because no one else did that night\". I can appreciate that, but she DID get sick from your food. And you won't offer to come the dinner, or do ANYTHING, even tho our entire vacation was ruined.  I wouldn't wish what my wife went through for those 28 hrs on my worst enemy. And no one seems to care or want to make it right. Extremely disappointed in the hotel and the restaurant. Never made a single complaint regarding the aria or any restaurant in the 15 times I've been to Vegas. Then when i finally have a problem, no one wants to make it right. Thanks for not caring.",

I asked the hostess and she confirmed it. ALL the waiters are male (oh -- except, of course, for the cocktail waitresses). ALL the hostesses are female. This is a high-end restaurant and tips are normally based on the price of entrees, so the waiters here are doubtless well paid. And those jobs are only open to men. I can't believe this is even legal in this day and age.   Food? Fantastic. Atmosphere? Romantic and classy. Drinks? I'm told that the Javier margarita is the best margarita in a tri-state area. LOL! So on the whole, I recommend Javier's. But Javier's, if you're listening, please change your hiring policies. I'd hate to have your doors closed by a class action lawsuit, because my husband and I count you as a \"don't miss\" Vegas experience that we look forward to every time we visit-!",

As we approached the restaurant and waited for our table I noticed that it was very \"Vegas\" with fancy decor. I knew it wouldn't be the same as a beachy restaurant in Southern California but it was almost too fancy.   We were seated inside and I was able to see this beautiful wood carved mural. I tried to get photos of it but there was so much going on that I couldn't get one.   The restaurant was very very loud.  Maybe it was just the acoustics, there wasn't loud music or anything like that it was just a lot of people talking very loudly and I couldn't hear my boyfriend across the table unless we talked loudly as well.    We started with the queso fundido. It was delicious, I loved the chorizo in this.  It got cold very quickly and it was difficult to eat but we made it work anyway.   He ordered the Milanesa de Pollo, and the chicken was very moist and perfectly cooked. My Mole Poblano dish was absolutely perfect. It's really hard to make mole well, and Javier's was excellent.   My only other complaint about the restaurant besides the loud atmosphere, was the fact that the prices were ridiculous compared to the prices I remember paying in Laguna Beach.  I know this is typical of restaurants inside of fancy strip hotels, and while neither of us is cheap, I do have to say that some of the best Mexican food is very inexpensive.",

We have been to many fancy 4 and 5 star restaurants in Vegas with a much higher price tag (though this place isn't inexpensive either) and yet the food here was far more delicious and memorable than most of those places plus the service was impeccable. We did have to wait 20-30 minutes to be seated but it was well worth it once seated. I was super impressed with the service being so great on a holiday weekend. Despite the wait to be seated, the food came quicker than typical and the waiters and staff checked on us often and were very friendly but polished. Their menu is huge and includes sustainably sourced seafood with daily specials. I had the chicken fajitas which were super tasty and then my boyfriend and I shared the cornbread with ice cream which was kick ass. He had the seafood trio enchiladas which he said were really good. I also appreciated that they boxed my leftovers in tiny side boxes (without my asking) versus those huge to go boxes places normally give you for tiny to go portions (rediculous). The ambience is lively with club-ish music but you can still talk to the people at your table. I loved it. Anyway, go here!",

    "text": "This review is based on the level of service, two items we ordered and the managers cocky attitude when I presented him with some feedback on our first Javier's experience.   I'm a local in Vegas and if I'm going out for Mexican food this wont be on my list. For a high end Mexican restaurant this place does not qualify. Save your $$$$$ and go somewhere else.   My group ordered 2 shrimp taco plates (2 on each plate) and both plates came out cold. We sent them both back and the plates came out cold again. When paying $$$ for 2 shrimp tacos you expect the kitchen to get it right 50% of the time.  Our other dishes came out fine ( quesadilla and enchilada) but even so not outrageously delicious. Our server didn't come check on us as often as one would expect and we were left dry for a fair amount of the time.   We got the bill and I was more than happy to pay but $181 for cold shrimp tacos, a quesadilla, an enchilada, and 2 rounds of drinks???  I asked to speak with the manager and he kept turning things back on me, like I did something wrong. His name was Omar, completely unprofessional and lacked the maturity of a manager for such a high end restaurant. He asked me if I ate all my cold food, I'm like, \"I was hungry.... I'm not gonna send my food back again and again and again to keep getting a cold dish\". His answer \"I'm not giving you a discount\". I didn't even ask for a discount but since he shoved that in my face instead of asking me \"how can I make your experience more enjoyable\", I said \"Why not?\".  He said \"we ate all our food\".  I'm trying to help you run your business by giving you constructive feedback and letting you know there was obviously something wrong in the kitchen, but he didn't seem, to care.   I'm done ranting on this place, hope everyone else has a better experience than we did, if this review does not turn you away. Otherwise there are a lot of restaurants in Vegas that give much better service and management actually cares what the customer has to say.",

If you don't eat the chips and salsa (we had a few, warm, salty and salsa a bit spicy) and free - nice, however the portion size on the veggie enchilada (if you don't eat white rice is a bit small ($20) tasty sauce, warm and full of calories!   The waiter did suggest veggie fajitas (not on the menu $24) not too bad, great selection of veggies. I would say high end but again my husband eats once a day 6 feet tall, 145 pounds, works out a lot and eats a lot if veggies...had hoped for more.  We did decide to indulge in drinks, I had the St. Francis Merlot ($12) very full bodied and full glass. My husband had the margarita ($12) very full and good tasting.  They offer two desserts:flan and fried ice cream, we did the ice cream. Funny - this was a larger portion, lightly fried (not heavy like some restaurants make) ($8) - fun to share - can share with four people!  Music not too loud, artwork around the restaurant detailed (reminded me a bit of the streets under Paris with the bones of the dead) - the back wall you should check out.",

I have never really found a margarita that I like, but based on the server recommendation I had a Tamarindo, then another...Yummy!  Also, several in our group said they didn't like mole, but again with server recommendation  they tried it and loved it.  I was one of those who claimed they didn't like it, but the mole was so good too!  It was a little loud to cover the casino noise, but the interior is beautiful,  great staff, and wonderful food.  I will definitely return next time I'm in Vegas.",

Time to pay the bill and they told me the computer will not accept it and they dont accept the comps anymore.  Got manager and she said same thing.  I told her why should i pay for your employees mistake?  She said sorry, but they cant do anything and they cant discount my bill.  Nice.  What that tells me is if they make a mistake i will pay for it.  If the food is cold, if it takes an hour, if its burnt... you will still pay or it.   When you have so many choices in town (and aria as well), why go there?",

The music was so loud that we had to lean in to hear each other. The bartender seems to think that a cosmopolitan is just a vodka cranberry served In a fancy glass. The shrimp cocktail was chewy and tasted like recently thawed frozen shrimp. While we were still chewing our first bite of shrimp, the entrees arrived....within 90 seconds of the appetizer.  That is a huge pet peeve.  It's just common sense that you don't serve the main course until the starter is completed.  Never again, Javier, never again.",

It had no flavor or seasoning of any kind other than some salt?  The beans tasted like el pollo loco pinto beans and were covered in water.  I can't even believe the cost of something that plain.  17 dollar margarita?  Yeah i know its not authentic and all that but if i can get better mexican food for a 6th the cost off an east oakland taco truck.  There's a problem.

As you can see, it's pretty rare that I post, but please be forewarned this establishment is NOT worth the price for the food quality, nor the service. The guacamole was bland, and not made table side a la Dos Caminos, or Rosa Mexicano. $12??? I don't think so.  We waited almost 45 mins for our food, only to have 3 of the 5 meals served. 5 mins later, mine arrived. After mentioning my concerns to two managers (in suits), the 5th and final meal arrived--lukewarm. Sadly we barely received an apology...other than \"the kitchen was behind\". For $30+ entrees, I don't believe anyone would accept this type of service. What made it worse was management didn't offer any type of goodwill gesture despite our gently provided comments. As someone who has worked in customer service/hospitality for over two decades, I can truly say I was extremely shocked.  Please do not frequent this sad excuse for a \"nice\" restaurant.  Was really hoping for an amazing experience. :(",

Husband got the chicken suizas - beware of the red onions as a topping.  When onions are really old - they are very potent. The chips and salsa were so salty - had to order two waters.

Mexican restaurants have a traditional standard of having amazing, hospitable waiters/waitresses, and Javier's was no different-- except great hospitality times 100.  My husband is a foodie critic. Seeing him pleasantly impressed with his dish of Mexican Carnitas told me everything about the food here. I ordered Carne Tampiquena and ate the BEST New York steak of my life-- so juicy, tender and savory. Their beans are so amazing (Refritos on the menu); they don't use pinto beans, they use Peruvian beans (hence, the delicious taste of authentic, Mexican retried beans). Their salsa is the best in Vegas. Definitely coming back.  They told us our wait would be 20 minutes, which ended up being only 10 mins. Free chips and salsa. FAST service. Funny, attentive staff. Great cocktails, like the large selection of mArgaritas, which include a Cucumber, Tamarindo, Jalapeno and the Original Javier mArgarita. Don't forget to ask for Tajin on the rim and to call ahead for a reservation!",

My Mexican coworkers talked about how all of the dishes were amazing, but I should be prepared to spend a pretty penny. Both of those things turned out to be True.   3 of us came in without a reservation and were seated immediately on a busy Saturday night.  The server was prompt and efficient in taking our order, and came back to get a drink order as we weren't quite ready. I HATE tequila but couldn't resist the guava margarita and don't regret it at all.   The food came out exceptionally fast, and the three of us devoured every last bite. While the room is romantically lit, it's a little too dark in loud for us to be able to comfortably have a conversation without yelling over the music. All in all, if I had a good night at work and had money to blow I would come back just for the enchiladas and margaritas!",

All of the food was super fresh and wonderful as always.  So glad I know now that there is an entire menu I can ask for when I go to the locations in Orange County.    Drinks: The margaritas are the best thing on the drink menu here.  Do not even look at anything else.  My favorites are the jalepeno and the tamarind, but my friends really enjoyed the pineapple one as well.    *side tip* This place, all the locations, is a great date spot.

Compliments to the chef which created these combinations. I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the chip & salsa as well.. perfectly salted warm chips paired with a super fresh salsa and perfect kick!

Plain and simple, Javier's is an over priced Mexican restaurant serving up traditional dishes with hand crafted cocktails.   Nonetheless, if you're ever going to over pay for Mexican food- do it here because Javier's is amazing! They do everything right. The spices, freshness, presentation and most importantly... taste- all done right.   Being of Mexican heritage myself, I have never been a fan of Mexican restaurants as I've always felt that none lived up to what momma would make. Javier's does.  My favorite dish is their enchiladas suisas. Chicken enchiladas in a sweet tomatillo cilantro(ish) sauce with a bit of fresh cream to top. They're almost identical to my mother's except now I don't have to beg her to make them for me.   Their handcrafted margaritas are great. I've been trying to drink everyone on the menu but I keep losing track.   Guacamole and chips- YES!   Even their rice and beans, which are my biggest gripe against Mexican restaurants, are delicious. Though, my family still makes better rice. However, I guess Javier's can't be perfect at everything or else they'd be that Valedictorian/ASB President/Drill Captain that everyone hated.",

    "text": "I came here for a friend's birthday and had hyped up the carnitas and margaritas since I have gone to Javier's Cantina in Laguna Beach and to the Crystal Cove and Irvine Spectrum locations. Boy, was I really disappointed!!!   My husband and I sat in the lounge area to enjoy a Cadillac Margarita before dinner... $24 just way overpriced. No bang for the buck. NO bang at all for a Cadillac Margarita.   Reservations were at 8:00 pm seated at 8:30 ish ... ordered the Carnitas dinner, a plate of fatty meat with some bones.. um... not edible at all. Also, ordered the shrimp tacos - 2 corn tortillas with 2 soggy breaded shrimp covered with a load of cabbage, horrible. Even the rice was bad, it was hard and cold.   The service at the lounge area was good, attentive, they came around often and offered more chips and salsa, filled the water glasses, and kept asking if we needed another drink. But the waiter at our table was in a mood... kept going to the back, and it seemed as if he was not into waiting on the table, bad night for him I guess.   Things are pricey especially in Vegas, but I expected a good drink, tasty food, and good service, that definitely did not happen here.",

    "text": "This is a two part review. I stayed at the Aria and went for lunch and then cocktails in the evening.   Lunch We had reservations and were seated quickly around noon. It was not packed, by pretty full when we were leaving around 1:30. The salsa and warm tortilla chips were addicting. I ordered the combination plat with a crunchy taco, chili relleno and chicken enchilada with red sauce.   Crunchy taco - terribly dry, stiff and hard, I didn't even eat it Chili relleno - good, but not great Chicken enchilada - good,but not great   Overall: 3 stars because food was good and not worth the $$$ price tag   Cocktails: It was loud and hard to chat, but clean and had good service. They again provided the yummy salsa and warm chips. My friends tried their margaritas at lunch and raved about how good and refreshing it was. So we went back for drinks before bed. I tried their pineapple margarita, it was ok and didn't taste as good as lunch.   Overall: 3-4 stars, I was the only one that wasn't happy  my drink, maybe my expectations were too high but everyone else was happy, so I may be a little bias. It tasted fine, but not great.",

I had the Chile Verde which was very tasty,  my husband ordered chicken fajitas which were not traditional fajitas.  No pan, no sizzle. They were just ok to me, but he liked them.  I would go here again to try other dishes because the service is excellent, and the menu looks great.",

The fish was fresh and the preparation had great flavor.  Their mole sauce with the chicken enchiladas was excellent. So was the red sauce with beef and the tomatillo sauce. Javier's features great margaritas and also did large non alcoholic versions for our girls.  We went with 4 vs 5 stars for two reasons: Their corn tortillas used for the tacos on 3 of our plates were tough. We didn't finish them as a result but we had plenty of other food on our plates that we didn't go hungry. The ambiance for dinner was dark and intimate. The only down side was the noise level. It was difficult to hear and we found ourselves talking louder to hear each other only adding to the noise level.   Overall we had a great evening. So much so that we're planning to visit again when there in September.",

Unfortunately this was also very dry. My problem wasn't as much as food not tasting up to par but more so than he fact that i had already expressed dissatisfaction with my original meal and accepted a recommendation provided by the waiter who never returned to ask me how things were. He never asked me what i thought of it or if it was to my liking which upsets me. Kinda made me think he just threw something out there to keep a price on a bill. That being said the difference in prices were deducted from his tip that i was going to leave sadly. Furthermore, i have decided to take my patronage else were dinning. Hopefully CATCH tonight is a better experience.",

We always get seated quickly, EVERY server has been extremely knowledgable and friendly, and the bussers are also very attentive and friendly as well. The chips and salsa are great but we always make sure to get the guacamole. Javier's just does guacamole right! If you like spicy, ask your server for a spicier salsa. They have an orange habanero salsa that we love and it has major KICKKK!!! You can't go wrong here but some of our favorites for entrees are:  - Carnitas (get it with the corn tortillas!) - Crab Enchiladas - Filete Costeno (8 oz Filet Mignon #1 Prime Center Cut, with choice of Dungeness crab or Maine lobster enchilada, but we always get it with crab!) - La Tablita (It's for 2 people per their menu but it's a BIG plate!) Prepare your own tacos with choice of two of the following - Angus Prime Skirt Steak, carnitas or grilled chicken. Served on a wooden platter with arroz, refritos, salsa quemada, guacamole, salsa fresca, jalapeno, grilled Mexican green onions and your choice of corn or flour tortillas.  For desserts, doesn't matter how full we are, we always order the Flan and the Fried Ice Cream! The flan isn't your run of the mill flan. It's hearty, rich, dense, eggy goodness! DO NOT pass this up. You'll thank me later. The fried ice cream isn't actually fried. The cinnamon sugar crust that the cornflake coated ball of ice cream sits in is what's actually fried. We've also tried the Pastel de Guayaba which had really nice authentic guava flavor, Pan de Elote which was moist and tender, and the Pastel Tres Leches (rich, decadent but not overly sweet, so good!)  We'll see you again soon! : )",

I've been to 3 locations of theirs and all were consistently great. My favorite menu item is the enchilada+ taco combo but I personally appreciate their amazing Pina margarita and their flan. To me, the trifecta of a good Mexican restaurant are good food, great margaritas and an authentic flan. But that's just me :) Buen provecho!",

Others reported their food was good but nobody was raving.  It has tastless beans and a chile stuff with cheese that was average. This steak for say $25-35 would be good, but for $55 I expect pretty top notch and while it was tender it lacked flavor.  Not my place, also SO SO noisy.  I probably not not be back. I see all these 5 stars, probably not Cali snooty people like me.",

But i guess, when you're in Vegas eating at a restaurant in a hotel/casino, that's to be expected. I mean one margarita is nearly as much as a meal (a cheaper meal). But when I'm spending over $150 on drinks and Mexican food, i expect it to be pretty damn good...but not the case here. Food was bland, portions were normal, but i wasn't even interested in taking our left overs, which says something for me This place was packed, and every time we walked by it, it seemed to be busy! The wait time is ridiculous! I would suggest going there an hour before you want to eat, put your name in, and then gamble, or wander the casino. There wasn't anything 'spectacular' about this place.",

The restaurant is very nice, it has a good atmosphere... and that's it. The service is extremely bad, we (group of 6) had a reservation for 9 pm, we had to wait until 10:20 pm.   \"Its ok, we will wait at the bar\" yet the bartender took 15 minutes to take our order and then forgot about half the drinks.   After complaining to the manager the problem was fixed.  Heard the margaritas here were great... but they really are nothing special. The ceviche was good, but the Guacamole was very dull and bland.  Once seated we ordered... the service was much better but the food wasn't. Honestly this is the most I have ever paid for bland Mexican food.  Its not bad, but I have experienced much better...",

Service was amazing (thank you Olivia) and the quality of great food paired with unique twists on margaritas enjoyed in a beautiful setting was a combination of perfection! Yes, by Mexican standards its a little bit more expensive than a typical restaurant but a solid splurge. The drinks add up quickly though at $15 each and they're small in size but not lacking in taste or a generous pour. We had everything! 2 shrimp cocktails (big Mexican reds), guacamole (light and fluffy), quest fundido (a bit to chipotleish for my taste), the Javier chop salad and had ordered the Shrimp ceviche but they were out of (?). Followed up the plethora of apps with a Bone in Ribeye and a Filet/Lobster combo-all delicious! You'd think that be it but no! Room to share a fried dulce du leche fried ice cream! Salsa is the real deal-perfectly balanced! It was a treat and this with 5 margaritas came to a total of $297 (gratuity exclusive)... With a comp for $300-we did our job maximizing its value!! I'm coming back for sure comp or not!",

We had to wait a long time to get in but not the worst situation, it is Vegas on a holiday weekend after all. My husband and I ordered the carne asada. We were so excited to get the full flavor one typically associates with carne asada with a traditional steak....well forgive the Vegas pun, no dice. See what I did there?   I ordered medium well, both steaks came out bloody, as in medium rare. We had waited almost an hour, I wasn't about to send it back and wait even longer. This is a 50 dollar meal per person for an improperly prepared, tough, flavorless steak. I have had much better prepared and flavorful steaks from outback.   Side note to the servers, give a steak knife when serving steak. This way when you serve tough steaks, your patrons fingers won't hurt when trying to cut their food.   Had the food been incredible, I would have said well worth the money. Food sucked, service not that much better. I would AVOID!",

We were starving when we arrived at 8:30, and almost dying by the time were seated 30 minutes later.  We were definitely getting cranky, but everything changed when he seated us at the most AWESOME group dining room ever!  It had a HUGE table, with large wooden chairs and an incredible ambiance.  It was the perfect size for our group and we had our own waiter who organized all the servers and busboys to keep us well attended.  The food was also very good.  Of course there was the chips-N-salsa (which we loved- the salsa had a nice flavor to it and was well-blended... also not too spicy).  The entrees were all a bit smaller than I would have expected, but no one complained about not having enough to eat.  Even though we were starving when we got there, I suppose we filled up on the chips and margaritas :)  The margaritas were very good (everyone tried a different type).  The strawberry one was like a smoothie (not sour at all), the pineapple was very tart, the tamarind was sweet (\"like an iced tea margarita!\").  The food was a little pricey, but definitely no complaints.  The service was amazing! (We were a large party, but they managed us very well).  The waiter even sported a stick-on mustache that we gave him so he would match the rest of us! (Very nice touch, props!)",

    "text": "My boyfriend loves the Javier's in Orange County, and so we were excited to see a Javier's when we came to Vegas. We had a really disappointing experience at this restaurant. The wait time we were given was 30-45 minutes. It was over an hour. We came right back when they called us. There was a line of people waiting to put their name on the list to get in, so we walked around to the side (where the hostess meets you to walk you to your table) and told them we were back. The woman we had initially talked to was nice to us (seriously, she was the best part of the whole experience), but the woman I encountered when I checked back in with them was really rude.   It took a long time to get any attention after we were seated, which was obnoxious because we were super hungry after our hour+ wait. The table next to us was seated after us, but got service way before us. On our other side was an 8 top with a bunch of young guys and some women we were pretty sure were escorts.   Our server wasn't very welcoming, nice, or helpful. He seemed annoyed when we didn't order drinks (they were pretty expensive and we were pretty much over drinking at that point in our trip!)  The guac we got was totally plain and boring. It was literally just smashed avocados and a dash of salt served on a wilted piece of lettuce.   My meal came out wrong. My enchiladas came out with NO SAUCE on them. They just brought me sauce on the side. I also was served the wrong kind of beans. When I mentioned this there was no apology of offer to correct it. I mentioned it twice and each time the person just said 'ok!' and walked away. I was really confused.   We got pretty much NO service from our server as he was busy with the 8 top next to us. We couldn't even flag him down. The bus boys were nice, but we still lacked the service and continuity that even a mediocre server gives.   Service ranked at zero stars, and I'd rate the food really low, too. My food wasn't good, but there were components that were tasty and I suspect that they can crank out some good stuff when they pull it together. Overall, though, the experience was really terrible. It's been a few weeks and I'm still thinking about how lame it was.   Also, it was super loud. This might be great if you're getting ready to party, but we were already partied out. We wanted to relax and have a good meal and this place was absolutely the wrong choice for that.",

The manager apologized the first time but did nothing to make the situation right..they removed the entrees off of the billl but meanwhile 2 hours of our evening was gone.

If I walked up to a bar and struck up a conversation with somebody, would my drink be added to their tab automatically? Major dislike points for this policy.   I'll spare the ad nauseam of every last detail, but I had a lunch here for 7 people. For $16, my enchiladas were okay, but not the most fantastic. Everyone else seemed just \"whelmed\" by their meal as well. Service on the slow side as well.   I would definitely come back to the bar (alone, obviously, or with cash because of their stupid no check splitting policy) for the excellent margaritas. I had the pineapple and the Javier--both were excellent. My friend had jalapeno--also excellent.   The ambiance is great, but with all the other details lacking, it would be hard for me to patronize this place again for a meal.",

It's always a quick and easy place to get into for lunch.   My complaint - the chairs in the bar. I mean, they are the biggest and heaviest chairs ever. We like to sit in the bar a lot. We usually order apps and drinks so the bar is perfect for us.  I love their seafood enchilada! Yummyy :) Oh and their green salsa with the avocado, just amazing, especially of you enjoy spicy!   All in all, it is a little overpriced food, but it's in the Aria, so we'll go again, I'm sure :)",

We started at the bar. We knew that they dont separate bills so we had to bring cash, but they also do that at the bar. No splitting! Everyone, except me, ordered margaritas, and everyone seemed to enjoy them.   We had a reservation so we were seated once we had everyone in our party there. The menu was nice, lots of different offerings.  Me and my friend ordered the seafood cocktail to start (shrimp, octopus and a delicious dressing....very tasty!), we also had a cesar salad (ok, nothing special), and our entree was recommended by the bartender. It was a 3 in 1. A lobster enchilada, a shrimp taco and a poblano pepper stuffed with crab and shrimp. Sadly, the lobster enchilada was eh as was the poblano pepper, however, the shrimp taco was FANTASTIC. Absolutely devine. I loved that the best of every single thing I tasted. The flavors were amazing. Wish we would have gotten that only. So so SOOOOOO good.  For dessert, the brought out a flan for Molly with a candle and we sung happy birthday. I wasn't impressed with the flan myself, but others did seem to enjoy.  I'd love to go back and try one of the margaritas that looked delish, and I will definitely get those shrimp tacos. They were GOOOOOOOOOOD!",

We came with an open mind, knowing that prices on the strip are much more than similar places off the strip.  It was a night out, so not a big deal.    We sat under the huge wood piece of the dead, which looks fantastic in a Mexican restaurant!  If it were anywhere else, I'd say let's go someplace else.  I ordered the fajitas de pollo, but it came out as the fajitas de beef.  Still, it was very tasty, so no complaints here.  Not a lot of food for the price, but I ate the hell outta their chips and salsa, so I was none too hungry.  Now I rarely drink, but I had to try their margarita de grenada, the pomegranate one.  For $15, it better have some kick to it.  Someone tell me why it was like drinking generic brand kool-aide?  Really!  It had about as much alcohol content as a bottle of water.  Pathetic.    So, it was somewhat of a nice dining experience, but truly, I have experienced better.  I think Javier's could get more stars from me if their bartenders weren't stingy.  Also, if they had a happy hour, or a set price group dining option.",

The bussers were always there at the right time to refill chips and salsa and water, and our waiter was there whenever we needed a menu or drink item.

    "text": "Ruined my wife's 30th Food- Tried the ceviche (very good) but nothing else. I will explain.   We decided to go to Javier's about 2 months before my wife's 30th B day. So I called in to make a reservation for 15, which was taken by the receptionist. Later on we called back and changed the reservation from a Friday to that Saturday. The receptionist accepted the request, so we thought everything was perfect. So it was time for dinner on Saturday and my wife and I are excited to be eating at a great location like Javier's in the ARIA. I let the receptionist know that we have a reservation at 8 under my wife's name. She tells us there is no such reservation, then she asked if we had a cake delivered, which we did from Jean Philippe (delicious by the way, recommend). We told her yes and she looked like someone just punched her dog. They told us that we need to wait until all the party arrived and they have a banquet room they could open up. We say the banquet room online and new it was beautiful so we got a little more optimistic that the night would not be ruined, we were wrong. Our party arrives and I let them know we are all here and they sat us down immediately. This was awesome, since there was a 2 hour wait. So we are soooo excited to be eating with friends and family especially because we got to eat in the beautiful banquet room, and we start to order drinks and our food. As we were ordering our food I could see the waiters face expression as to say \"that's all you're going to order\". Most of us liked the appetizer menu (Ceviche was great) and we were still waiting for 6 people that were still coming. The night was young and we had a lot of ordering to do, especially alcoholic beverages (Margaritas were average).  After the waiter leaves, we receive some of our appetizers and all our drinks, I observe a few guys in suits and ties and our waiter talking while they were pointing to our direction. The Suits started wondering around which for some reason made me wonder what they were doing. I bring it to my wives attention and she jokingly said \"What if they decide to move us\". We both gave a nervous giggle. About five minutes later one of the Suits comes walking up to me and says what we feared. \"We are going to have to move you\". He could have said a few other things after that but I did not hear any of it. I asked him to give us a few minutes and he said yes and walked off.  We were all a little shocked since we were halfway into our B day dinner night.  We all got up drink in hand and tentatively started to walked over to what we thought was our table, but they sat us down at the bar area to wait for the next available table. Mind you our food was done and ready to be served. My wife and our group were extremely embarrassed.  My wife was visibly upset so my sister in law decided to talk to the Manager. When they were in discussion the Manager said \"What it comes down to is you were not spending enough money to be in that room\" She came back to tell us what he had said and we were floored. My wife just decided to cut our losses and just leave. When we notified the manager we just wanted to leave because we have never been treated like this at any restaurant and pay for what we consumed he just replied \"OK\". No apologies, Nothing. The icing on the cake (no pun indented) was while this was going on a group of 6 women, yes I said 6, we counted were comfortably sat in the banquet room our party of 9 at the time but soon to be 15 was just exiled from.  We asked for our cake, paid our bill and walked out. I would never recommend Javier's. They have very, very Bad Management and obviously not very good at making reservations. We enjoyed my wife's delicious cake from Jean Philippe in the comfort of our room. In my sarcasm voice \"Thanks Javier's\"",

The food is just, ok and definitely not worth the price charged. We were told in advance that they were unable to split the check, which sucks when your going with a group of friends, but we went with it. Most of us had cash and paid accordingly, but there were two that used their cards. For some reason, when the cashier got the bill back she charged one card the entire $433. Completely ignoring the $350 that was in it. I'm unsure what she thought that $350 in cash was for at that point. On top of that, in trying to remedy the problem, they charged her the correct amount and double charged the other friend for her portion of the bill. When called over, the manager was in a word - INEFFECTIVE!! We were told that the $433 hold should drop from my friend's account....we'll see.",

There is another Mexico City style restaurant in the Shops at the Venetian that I like as much and the ambiance is great as it is next to the canal but this place is more romantic and a better dinner atmosphere. Margaritas were exceptional as well. Only comment is it was expensive, as are most things in Las Vegas but the quality and flavor were excellent.",

    "text": "We grabbed lunch at Javier's while staying at Vdara the week of New Year's. It was one of our favorite meals (the first being dinner at BarMASA). Javier's was so good that we almost returned the next day. Their menu is large and the cocktails were great (at least the margarita I had). My only complaint is the price. Yes, I know it is Vegas...we go often and eat at nice restaurants. However, I think $20 is a bit steep for 2 tacos -- but, the bartender informed me of their bar special where you can get 5 tacos for $26...so we did that and just took some home, which was a better deal. The shrimp ceviche was great, my steak and chicken tacos were also yummy, and my husband's carnitas quesadilla was also good. The guacamole was good, but nothing special. I'd probably skip it next time, but everything else was on point. Next time I want to try the shrimp tacos - the guys beside us were absolutely raving about them!",

The bartender was really nice, had a couple margaritas which were fantastic then ordered Carnitas for dinner.    When my food arrived the presentation was good but the meat was so incredibly dry I could barely pull it apart.   I complained twice  to the bar tender expecting him to offer  me something else and he just kind of shrugged and told me they are usually very tender.  I expected a litte more from  a place where you are paying $30 bucks a plate.   The fact that they didn't attempt to correct the problem really bothered me....$60 buck dinner tab which was pretty crappy all the way around.",

As our day progressed we realized we would not make it by the reservation time.  I was able to call and change it to an hour later with no problem.  That said, when we arrived at 8pm...the place appeared pretty much full.   We were seated promptly in a nice big, round booth...and from the moment I tasted the salsa for the chips....I knew this was going to be good!  The salsa had just the right mix of flavors and a lil kick at the end.   I am a big Mexican food lover.  I ordered enchiladas rojas..one chicken and one cheese.  Yummmm!!  My boyfriend is not nearly as much into Mexican food as I am, but this place had more than enough items on the menu that you would not find at a typical Mexican restaurant....so he had lots of options.  He went with the rib-eye(Filete Ladrillo)...and loved it!   This will definitely be one of my go-to places whenever I visit Vegas!",

I believe her exact words were \"you can't bring that thing in here\".  I had no choice but to change her at our dining table.  I'm sure the next customers to sit our table would love to know that there could possibly be poop left over on the table of this dark and dingy restaurant.  The food is way over priced and nothing special.  I've been to a Sharkey's restaurant with better quality of food.  The drink prices are ridiculous, $15 for the smallest and worst tasting cadillac margarita I've ever had.  If you don't have a baby, and like over paying for drinks and crap food Javier's Las Vegas is your place.",

    "text": "We love dining at Javier's when in vegas. We are from Orange County and love the Newport Beach location as well. Unfortunately, we won't be going back to the Las Vegas location. Last night we sat down and ordered drinks and I was carded, which is a compliment seeing as I'm a 34 year old mom of two. I didn't have my id as I haven't been carded in probably 5 years. My husband showed him his id (he's 35) and he still wouldn't allow me to order a drink. We asked to speak to a manager twice and no one would talk to us. I get it. I should have had my id. But it would have been nice of the manager to come over and see for himself that I clearly don't look like I'm 20. Instead he was schmoozing a table across the restaurant with shots of tequila. My issue isn't that they wouldn't serve me. Like I said, I should have had my id and I would never want to jeopardize the waiters job. My issue is that the manager was asked twice to come to our table and didn't have the decency to speak to us. Pretty crappy customer service if you ask me and the food wasn't that great last night either.",

    "text": "My wife and I went to try this place recently while we were on vacation during the month of June 2014. I'm a fan of the Jim Rome show and he raved about it on his radio show one recent morning so I figured I'd give it a try since I'd be coming out to Las Vegas. We ordered guacamole for the appetizer, the \"mole poblano and carne tampiquena\" for dinner. For drinks we had a couple of margaritas. I can't remember the actual name but they were made with some sort of top shelf tequila.  The ambiance was very dark but classy. It wasn't as busy as I thought it would be so this was nice. It was a Tuesday evening around 9pm when we arrived. The music over head was upbeat in English and Spanish and not to loud so that was a plus. The waiter was very attentive and talkative. He was very personable with us.  The guacamole appetizer was a decent portion and garnished decoratively with chips. However, it lacked flavor. I'm not a fan of salt but I needed to add some to give it more flavor than the soft avocado taste and light cheese sprinkled on. I must be used to seeing and tasting other spices and things (onion, tomato, cilantro, etc.) on guacamole so not seeing this I was a little surprised.  The margarita was decent. But not worth the price. I've had better margaritas at half the cost. If you are ever in Stockton Ca you should try Arroyos Cafe. They make good strong and flavorful margaritas. The mole was really good. The sauce was thick, dark and not runny with very good flavorful spices. It had a good bite in the end. Not spicy. Just made well with a variety of spices to give it that good mole flavor. No salt needed here. Unfortunately the rest of the items that were part of the meal were not so special. They were just ok and are not worthy of a recommendation. The waiter offered us a complimentary \"flan\" desert for our anniversary so we decided to try it. That too unfortunately lacked flavor. It needed more sauce because it was rather dry and the syrup was not very sweet in flavor. I guess if I had to describe this experience in one word I would have to say \"bland\". For two people it was $125 including the tip. It's Las Vegas so what do you expect. That's what I figured based on a few reviews I read before coming to dine here. I don't mind paying for a good meal but if Mexican food is what you're craving, I would recommend looking at other options before settling to dine here. If you're ever in Sacramento, I would recommend Zocalo in mid-town Sacramento for Mexican fine dining.  I read this establishment started in Southern California so if any of my SoCal trips in the future bring me near Javier's in SoCal, I would give it another try just because I want to make sure I give it a fair chance.",

The decor is very cool, and they even have what they call a \"tequilla tree\" near where we sat.  We had a nice, big, and comfortable booth to sit in.  First off, I want to say that the service here was absolutely fantastic.  Our server, whose name escapes me, took great care of us throughout our meal.  I had never had mole sauce, and he brought us all some to try before we ordered.  I was immediately sold on it and ordered the chicken enchiladas with mole sauce.  My wife ordered chicken tacos while my mom ordered the beef tacos.  It was a simple, yet very good lunch.  They give you chips and salsa when you sit down, so be careful not to fill up on those, as it's very good.  Everything here is very fresh and home made.  Our server even gave us a complimentary fried ice cream for dessert.  I will most definitely come back here again.",

Plus we just got done eating at Shake Shack so we were full....Javier's is quite possibly the best specialty dining Mexican food on the strip...specialty meaning in between fine dining and them casual restaurants like Chevy's and Border Grill.  For drinks we got a Organica and a Tamarindo Margarita. Both were good as fuck with Organica being pure and el naturale and strong as fuck and the Tamarindo being a citrusy type mah gah ree ta.  Chef brought out the Sabor a Provincia which is two empanadas, two small quesadillas, two taquitos, and two sopes:  Empanadas were overall good  Taquitos were a little bit tooo crispy (if there is such thing) but the meat inside was tender and nice  Sopes were decent with fresh ingredients on top but....  Them Quesadillas were <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.com&s=bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bomb.com</a>....i usually do not care for cooked or hot seafood but these seafood quesadillas were the business. Drunk bougie food that El Chapo probably ate on a daily basis after he got fucked up with his homies...  Honestly you can order that plate as an entree and get full.  Hopefully I will have a full dining experience there one day.",

    "text": "Javier's is a good Mexican restaurant located inside of Aria Hotel Casino. Some things to try are the Sabor a Provincia which are two Empanadas, two small Quesadillas, two Taquitos, two Sopes. Next I like the Nachos de la Casa they are made with Monterey Jack cheese, refritos, guacamole and sour cream, with your choice of shredded chicken, shredded beef or chorizo. Another favorite is the Fajitas you have the choice between Adobo marinated strips of natural chicken or Angus beef steak sauteed with pasilla chile, onion and tomato. Served with refritos, guacamole, sour cream and your choice of warm tortillas. The Enchiladas de Mariscos are also good you get Two enchiladas stuffed with shrimp and Dungeness Crab sauteed in butter, garlic, onion and wine, then covered in a tomatillo sauce, melted Monterey Jack cheese and garnished with avocado slices and sour cream. Served with arroz and refritos. All of the enchiladas are actually delicious but I don't have time to write all of them down for you so I just did one. The Carne Asada is also really good. It's made with New York Steak #1 prime center cut 12oz grilled and served with a grilled pasilla chile stuffed with cotija and Monterey Jack cheese. Served with refried black beans. The restaurant is located right on the casino floor which makes it nice and convenient if you're gambling and want to walk over and grab a bite to eat or  margarita.",

While our first bartender was friendly enough, he went on break shortly after he served our drinks and we didn't see him again. In his place was a surly man that clearly did not want to be there and hates his life. Our food came, and I did not like the dressing that came with my salad. When I asked the surly bartender to swap it out, he literally acted as if I was asking him for one of his kidneys. I asked for one of the other vinaigrettes that I saw came with a different salad, and he claimed it did not exist. He was literally looking at me and my friend as if he hated us, and we are quite pleasant people. Ha! Also, he only gave us the copy to sign when he brought us the bill. When I asked for a copy to take home, again he glared at us. Not a pleasant dining experience at all.  Food wise, my chopped salad likely would have been good if I had had a dressing to go with it. The one that was originally brought to me was way over seasoned with black pepper, so much so that I sneezed when I tasted it. They did include plenty of shrimp, so no complaints there. My friend said his mole chicken was just OK, so wouldn't recommend that. The chips were fresh and the salsa was tasty. I also really liked my organic margarita, probably because it was made by the friendly bartender and not the miserable one.",

They said it would be an hour and some wait for two. We sat at the bar ordered a drink got served chips but as soon as our drinks came out we got called no more than 10 minutes to our table!  It's loud with music like a lounge which makes it difficult to talk but that's the atmosphere, dim lighting so you have to use flash to take pictures. They are very attentive if you're running low on water , chips, and if you're down with your plate. Our waiter was great, and i can't find a bad thing to say about this place.

    "text": "My favorite find in Vegas this trip. We wandered in looking for some appetizers and drinks and sat in the bar. We got the queso fundido and margaritas (tamarind and Javier's). I would skip the queso next time - it was bland - but the chips/salsa and margaritas are worth the visit. Chips were thin, crispy and fresh and the salsa was absolutely delicious. The margaritas were the best we've ever had. Don't pay $8 for a sugary mess out at the casino bar - come here and spend the extra $ - you won't regret it.   The atmosphere here is so cool. They have the world's largest wood sculpture on the back wall and it was carved by a chainsaw artist from Oregon. I could stare at it for hours - it was amazing. The servers were also really knowledgable (how we learned about the art) and had a vast knowledge of their tequilas. When we were heading out the waitress asked if we wanted \"roadies\". Best suggestion ever. Would totally just come here to get a drink to walk with - they're that good. We came here twice in one day.",

It was refreshing and delicious.   The staff are super cool, accommodating and attentive.   The decor is beautiful. I must return again.   They have a HUGE room for private parties that sits 18-20 people for lunch or dinner. This room is so beautiful, private and breathtaking. If you have a private party, make sure to book Javier!!   The food is amazing!!  I got the vegetarian fajita! It was soooo good. The veggies were fresh and Healthy. The whole meal was light and yummy.   I will be back definitely.",

Got a great table and wonderful service. Ordered all three of the ceviches... they were so tasty! I never had ceviche like that.  I got the lobster enchiladas with crab stuffed poblano chile.. I forgot what the dish was called... something cruz? Anyways, it was so amazing. Sauce was on point. Poblano was cooked to perfection and lobster tasted so fresh.  Loved the guacamole... and everyone at the table enjoyed their food so much! I will def come back and eat there again! Already planning the next trip!",

    "text": "My family and I have always been big fans of Javier's. We live in Southern Cali and have attended the Irvine, Santa Monica, and NewPort Beach locations. The food has always been 5 stars no matter which location we attend. Customer service has always been friendly and very respectful.  We recently came on vacation to Las Vegas and visited the Javier's in the ARIA Casino. (not the first time) and we ordered like we always do. Food was amazing as it has always been. But this time the Carnitas Plate was very disappointing, it was all bone and only contained a small piece of Carnitas. Very disappointed in the dish, the plate has always been full of meat and has been filling. We told our server about this dish (Ricky S.) he offered to exchange our plate for an \"Arrachera\" since he noticed we liked that plate. So we said it was a nice gesture of him since the Carnitas plate was disappointing. So we accept his offer, and as we finished our dinner we asked for the check and noticed that he charged us for the Arrachera plate ($40.00) and not the Carnitas? He did not tell us he was going to charge us the full plate since the Carnitas plate was all bone and we didn't eat it.  We asked to speak with the manager. So the manager (Moises) comes to the table. We tell him the situation and he was completely rude. Making us feel as if we were liars, as if we invented the whole story. The manager responded saying that his employee will never offer to exchange anyone's plate and that they don't do exchanges. As my mom speaks to him he makes eye contact with her and just looks away and does not answer her questions. The manager kept denying over and over again what the server had told us and said that in Javier's they don't give out free food?! We were obviously not asking for free food we simply were overwhelmed and frustrated with the service and the lack of communication they provide to the clients. Very, VERY disappointing experience. They should teach managers better customer service skills and they should have all employees on the same page about situations like this? Why offer to exchange something and not make it clear that your gonna get charged for it. I will not be coming back to this location.",

Both are average for good Mexican, no complaints. The margs are $18 and I think the guac is $10. The place has a reputation for being pricey. In any case, the reason for the poor rating is the service. Possibly the worst bartenders I have ever interacted with in any bar on the planet. It sounds like hyperbole, but it's just this yelper's honest opinion. Couldn't get a drink order in; couldn't get my bill. Credit card handed back with slime on it.   If you read up on the story of the joint -- they're a chain from Orange Co., Calif. that caters to well-heeled diners -- you can see where the attitude comes from. It even extends to the weirdo bathroom attendant who talks your ear off. If you're trapped in the Aria and need a margarita, go to the casino bar off the gaming floor. They make a passable one with significantly less BS added in.",

This comes with your choice of flour or corn tortiallas. Comes with sour creme, cheese, pico de gallo, white refried beans and guac.  Portion is very large and can be shared.  The Enchilda with Mole sauce is also great tasting.  It comes with 2 enchilads, rice and refried beans. This is served on a fancy dish. Presentation is great.  Def try the guacamole ! They bring out complimentary chips and salsa, very fresh!  I wouldnt goto any other Mexican restuant in Vegas, dont waste your time and money.",

My wife started on hers and it was hard as a rock. I offered her mine and she passed on it. So, I bit in, or at least I tried to, mine was just as hard. We told the server and he said \"That's how we make them. We make a taco in a flour tortilla then deep fat fry it.\" I said, 'but, it's not sealed, that's why its hard as a rock and tastes like grease'. He just smiled and shrugged his shoulders. They did make it right and took it off the bill.   My only other suggestion, pay your electricity bill and turn on the lights. Everyone we saw was using their phone light to read the menu. Insane.",

Unfortunately, the food isn't on par with everything else. The chips and salsa is great with the drinks, but the seafood quesadilla that I ordered was quite salty. Some of the standard mexican dishes that other people ordered didn't seem to pop out either.  For an upscale mexican restaurant, I was more than happy with everything but the main entree. The food is much better at smaller family owned restaurants so unless you have a craving for mexican food in Vegas, I'd recommend going somewhere else for food.",

Each time I'm in town, I always stop by here for a delicious Tamarindo cocktail and the seafood enchiladas!  You can't ever go wrong...    Service here is impeccable and the quality is never lacking, this place is a bit more expensive then the Newport Beach location but I'm assuming its because of the cost to import the seafood.  Either way its definitely a great place to diner.  I like to visit this place during lunch time because its not as crowded and typically doesn't require a reservation.    If you want the more romantic and intimate experience, I would definitely suggest visiting during dinner.",

From the interior to the plating, nothing felt sloppy.   Satisfying & authentic food. Some items hit the mark more than others. My brother loved his Cabo Azul.  Good generally not served spicy. They have a salsa picante available and it is incredibly spicy. Definitely worth requesting if you like hot food. (Not tobasco hot. Habanero chili, your mouth will tingle spicy).   It is pricy. Not an everyday place, but a great experience when you can make the trip. Take a look at the bar and desserts, some interesting options.",

However once seated, service was prompt, drinks were good, and food exceeded expectations.  Very large menu, something for everyone. Just wish a better hostess experience which made for a bad initial first impression.",

I don't think it's that good unless your super hungover and want a fat burrito you will regret after eating. My opinion. We went with the three meat fajita platter for two. The meats we had were all unique in taste, very good marinades and were cooked to perfection. The beef was perfect, pink in the middle and seared on the outside, pork was perfectly seasoned and crisp on the outside too. The chicken, moist and grilled perfectly. The sides couldn't have complimented the meal any better than they did. If there was one restaurant anyone should try It is definitely this spot. Oh and before I forget, no gristle!!!!! No chunks of fat!!",

It's like crack, but slightly easier to get. I tried snorting it so that I could get a better high but the hostess looked at me funny and I stopped. I'm so serious. Even their house red salsa was fantastic. This place serves the second best complimentary chips and salsa that I've ever had in my life. There was a steak thing that was pretty good and a lobster enchilada thing that was pretty good but this review is all about the salsa. Salsa. Eat the Salsa. Eat it. Get full off of it you dumb tourist, you.",

I had the steak tacos for lunch (delicious!) and the carnitas as well as the steak taquitos for dinner. My mom had the enchiladas poblanas for both meals. We both loved our dishes. The guacamaole on my tacos and on the taquitos was fabulous. I will have dreams about the taquitos. The staff at Javier's is great. The restaurant is off the casino so it can be a bit noisy and the crowd it attracts may get noisy. There are also tvs in the restaurant and a bar. That being said, I loved it and I can't wait to go back to Vegas and go to this restaurant again. It's reasonably priced for the amount of food and the quality of food that you get. I highly recommend Javier's!",

I had the the steak fajitas my gf had enchiladas. She had a drink and I had a nice cold beer. The drinks were good and the environment made us want to back next time we're in Vegas.

Head over to Javier's, order any flavor of fresh margaritas, mine is the jalapeno, the Guacamole as an app, then for dinner, The Carnitas.  You'll leave full, and with a huge smile on your face.

    "text": "$50 Aria resort credit well spent on 3 mean margaritas!   We randomly stumbled in to this place because my girlfriend and her sister were attracted to the restaurant's ambiance and decor. The wide, dark-lit restaurant with the large rounded bar area overlooks the casino area. Even though this place looks all classy and flashy, I don't think I would come here for the food because I've been spoiled with all the great hole-in-the-wall spots in LA and San Diego. Plus, it's also about 4-5 times more expensive than the tacos/burritos I get at Alberto's. We did try the quesadilla though just to snack on, which was very good.  I would definitely come back for the margaritas! I don't drink a lot of margaritas but the ones they serve here are probably the best I've ever had. I like the concoction of the Pepito Cucumber margarita. Top shelf tequila with bits of cucumber mixed in, delish! I also like the Jalapeno margarita.. not spicy but has that kick and flare brought by the jalapeno. Just the drinks with chips and salsa was definitely a good recipe for a start of a good night!",

    "text": "*note: the one star is only given because of the look of the restaurant.  My partner called and made reservations on November 19 at 9pm.  The hostess was told that it was my birthday dinner and to make sure that the server knew.  We get to Javier's and not only do they have us waiting 20 minutes after our reservation but the hostess was some snobby girl who barely acknowledge us probably because we are young.  We get sat and notice that there was a lot of Latin Grammy directors/crew/etc. we were sat right in the middle of the restaurant but the servers seemed so very attentive to the people to the Latin Grammys that they forgot about us. Seriously?  *IF YOU LOOK LIKE YOU ARENT RICH OR YOU ARE YOUNG, THEN mOST LIKELY YOU WILL GET SHITTY SERVICE*  we finally get a server to get our drink order, then we have another server bringing our drinks and then had another server take out food order. Like who are we supposed to tip ?  We continue our \"dining experience\" and hope that the food is at least good considering that it is considered pricey Mexican food .  My best friend orders a shrimp quesadilla. She looked past the $30 PRICE FOR A QUESADILLA CONSISTING OF ONE LARGE TORTILLA. MONTEREY CHEESE AND RUBBERY SHRIMP. she clearly wasn't happy but didn't make a complain. I then order an Antojito platter.  Not only was the server too rushed to tell me what kind of meat the items came with (because the menu doesn't say) but the mini quesadillas CAME WITH SHRIMP!!!!! THE SERVER NEVER TOLD ME AND I ONLY FOUND OUT UNTIL I BIT INTO IT. I AM ALLERGIC TO SHRIMP AND MY LIPS STARTED SWELLING UP .  we told one of the servers and HE STILL DARED TO ASK ME IF I WAS REALLY ALLERGIC OR I JUST DIDNT LIKE IT. THE NERVE..... what's the worst was they just brought me a regular quesadilla with less cheese, no apology, no nothing. AND to think I was excited about celery rating my birthday here.  We finish eating, the food honestly could've been better and tastier from a hole in the wall off the strip or from Cabo wabo cantina at planet Hollywood . And for a lower, lower price.  The server didn't ask how everything was, was just pushing more drinks on us and we just wanted to go.  We got the check, THEY FORGOT IT WAS MY BIRTHDAY (Which we were told they would bring me a little something and sing for me) but nothing.  He dropped off the check, picked it up and then made a point that how could a beautiful lady like my best friend be paying for me !  MAYBE IF YOU WERE REMINDED THAT IT WAS MY BIRTHDAY OR EVEN ACTUALLY BOTHERED READING MY ID WHEN YOU ASK FOR IT ( which clearly you didn't even read how old I was) but YOU WOULDVE KNOWN WHY MY GIRL BESTFRIEND PAYED FOR MY FOOD.  We left with an unsettled stomach based on the food and the experience.  And to top it all off. The check came out to about 125 with taxes and we left well above 20% just to laugh at these servers faces who thought we didn't have money.  I'm sure they need that 25% tip way more than we did.  Definitely never coming back here and letting all our friends/family know since this was one of my favorite restaurants before .",

After spending the day at the pool, I was totally looking forward to getting the Cabo Azul at Javier's! Make a reservation because the wait is long, but the bar is open seating, and usually pretty empty.  They serve you warm chips and salsa first. Chips were perfect and the salsa was slightly spicy but refreshing. Came with 3 other friends and we all ordered the Cabo Azul! Definitely the best thing on the menu! Lobster enchilada with green sauce and sour cream, rice and refried black beans, crab stuffed green pepper and the best shrimp taco I've ever had. If you're looking for an alternative to a buffet for about the same price, I'd go here, because I was super full! and I didnt even finish everything! Totally worth it for $30, considering the enchilada and peppers were stuffed with seafood. The refried black beans were soft and sweet. I would say the shrimp taco was the best. The fried shrimp was crispy and the tortilla was quite delicious. Perfect bite every time too!  Def coming back again! Service was amazing, atmosphere was super nice! Good location, right next to the casino and lobby of the Aria.",

The chips and salsa here are second to none. I have yet to try the guacamole, but based on the little side that comes with the dishes it is incredible.   The carnitas are the best I've had. Ever. Anywhere. It is a must try. The Enchiladas poblanas are incredible. I am not generally a big fan of mole sauce, but this one hits the spot. The chicken fajitas are amazing too. I've had a number of other dishes as well (seafood enchiladas, chile verde..) all of which are well above average, but those 3 dishes are my favorite. I'm yet to try dessert because there's never any room left by the end of my meal, but I'm sure those are amazing too.  You're going to pay more than the average Mexican joint, with most entrees being around $25, but you get what you pay for. One last thing, the atmosphere here is great. Decor is unique, the booths are large and comfortable.",

The decorations were very dark featuring chainsaw wooden art in the seating area. Our waiter was very knowledgable and told us about the art's representation of life through the passage of time. Speaking of our waiter, he was very attentive and extremely helpful as their menu selection is great.   Yes, they're guacamole was awesome but pretty much everything on their menu is just as awesome. I got the chance to try their carnitas - it was slightly crispy on the outside and it was cooked so tenderly. The sauce it was served with was cilantro and limey and on point. Yum!  I ordered the cabo azul which features the star seafood entrees which include the lobster enchilada, crab and shrimp chile relleno, and the shrimp taco. Our waiter advised me to eat the shrimp taco first because of the coleslaw, and I was glad he told me so. It was refreshing and the fried shrimps were succulent and yummy. Lobster enchiladas were covered with this spicy green salsa that paired so nicely with the cool sour cream. The chile relleno was just okay, but I think it's just because chile relleno is generally not my most favorite Mexican option.   Yes, this place is priced well above traditional Mexican options, but it's Vegas, the food is quality, the service is great, and it's a place worth visiting before your fantastic night out.",

I have to admit i had my reservations about coming here at first as i had been burned by other 'Mexican' places out here in vegas. Coming from Los Angeles, i guess I'm a bit of a snob about my Mexican food. But this place did not disappoint, in fact, i was impressed. First off, hostess and waitress were super friendly, decor is not typical, its very modern. Salsa that comes with the complimentary chips is homemade and a hair spicy, just the way i like it. Menu extensive, which i give bonus points for over MESA GRILL, which has a very limited menu. I ordered one of the combination plates that comes with an enchilada (chorizo), crispy taco (beef) and chile relleno. I usually hate chile rellenos but have been converted due to Javiers. One thing I've never seen or had is that serve refried white beans. WOW! They're much smoother in taste and texture than pinto or black beans. Super good. I also ordered a tamarindo (tamarind) margarita. Im a light drinker so if i taste ANY alcohol in my drink, i hate it. This is the smoothest hard drink I've ever had.  I can go on and on about this place. I want to go try their  seafood now. Hope you guys go try this place out and have as great an experience as i did.  More places in Vegas should be as authentic in taste as this place.",

    "text": "Epic Fail!  My wife and I went there for after dinner drinks. I was buying $20 shots of Reserva Familia tequila with soda back. They were charging me $5 per soda, since they did not have a soda gun. Absolutely ridiculous!!! First of all, how can they not have a soda gun at such a nice hotel? In any other bar on planet earth, I get a mixer with booze for free. Javier's is not owned my Aria, so there was no recourse through the hotel management. The bartenders said, 'sorry...that's just how it it here.'  There was no one in the restaurant, even though it was a busy Thanksgiving weekend. Maybe arrogant service and overcharging explains it. I am writing to the hotel about this. It's totally wrong to treat people who are already paying heavily for their vacation like this.",

    "text": "Javier's in The Aria Resort and Casino is a Mexican restaurant that was just slightly above average for us. We dined there our second night in Las Vegas and although the margaritas were very good and the food was pretty good, our experience with our waiter was extremely poor (Unfortunately, I can't remember his name).  We had the ceviche with octopus and shrimp at it was pretty good although it was SWIMMING in lime juice(this was the first time that I have had ceviche, so maybe that is the was it is supposed to be served). My wife had a salad, which was fantastic and I had the seafood enchiladas, which were pretty good as well.   Our issue with the service was the fact that we were continually rushed through dinner. The entire experience felt like we were being hustled by a used car salesman. We were not impressed. Additionally, our waiter told us that if we were charging the meal to our room, we had to wait for him to come back and get the check so that he could run the charge AND THEN, we could leave. Now, I get the fact that there are \"dine and dashers\" out there, but don't expect me to wait around so that you can verify whatever it is you need to verify. We were staying in a penthouse sky suite at The Aria and charged everything to our room and never once were asked to wait for someone to verify our stay. The entire experience was very weird. I would not recommend Javier's to anyone based on our experience, but it might be worth a shot as long as not all of the wait staff conduct themselves like used car salesmen.  Visited July 2014",

Service was very friendly and attentive. Chips and salsa were a nice compliment to my potent margaritas and there was great people watching. The food was pretty good, nothing to write home about, but I kept it simple and ordered a taco/enchilada combo. To be honest, after the first margarita, I could have been eating taco bell and been happy, ha! But the food was good and I had to take my third margarita \"to-go\" (gotta love Las Vegas!!)  A little pricey, but that's to be expected at any Vegas resort.  Next time, I'll try something a little more fancy and unique ... with a nice margarita to go with it, naturally!",

    "text": "Javiers Mexican Food at: ARIA RESORT  Nice spacious surrounding, modern decor,  dim lighting for ambience, dark wood and comfy dark brown leather seating areas for an intimate setting, but an extremely noisy environment, it was hard to speak without shouting. They brought out the chips & salsa before filling our water glasses or giving us as much as a single menu. We asked a server if we could get some water and that's all that we got, not even a single ICE CUBE! Our waiter came over to take our order and noticed that we didn't even have menu's.   I asked the waiter and a server twice for some ice for our water before finally receiving any. The margaritas were very small approx. 8oz. after they add a ton of ice (how ironic) and is served in one size only, extremely disappointing for an upscale mexican restaurant, surprisingly my margarita was loaded with ICE CUBES!  The food was good, not great. The best part was the salsa, but make sure you order the ICE water first.   Overview: Poor Service, Expensive Food, small portions, both the food and the size of the 8oz. margaritas. BYOI- Bring Your Own Ice (unless you order a margarita). Loud, noisey environment. I wouldn't recommend bringing your date here if you're looking for a little peace & quiet. Great Chip's & Salsa though...  Bottomline:  Go to Willy & Jose's over at SAM'S TOWN,  (AYCE) ALL you can eat Taco's and ALL you can drink margaritas for only $10 Sun-Thurs. YES, I did say ALL YOU CAN DRINK MARGARITAS! and if you dine outside on the terrace a FREE lazer light water show that is simply awesome. Pretty hard to beat for only TEN Buck's!",

This place does not disappoint in that department! Crispy, extra crunchy chips and very flavorful, spicy salsa.   One meal was seafood nachos, the next seafood quesadillas, and lastly seafood enchilada trio.  Yes, seafood galore, I know. But it's fresh and tasty. The bar location is perfect to grab a bite or sit in the dining area and relax.   I don't understand why some people think this place is pricey. We pay these prices in Chicago. The portions seemed normal to me, not small. Perhaps it's just various demographics, but I recommended this place to anyone who would listen and even to some who wouldn't!   I know this place from Southern Cali and its just as good in Vegas. A must if you're staying at Aria and check it out if you are just in the area. I will definitely be back!",

    "text": "Our large party was seated in a gorgeous room, cocktail orders taken, water poured and then it all went downhill. I don't even recall being asked if I wanted water but I recall the waiter pouring me water along with the other 23 people I was with. At the end of our meal, the bill came with a $130 charge for bottled water. A waiter pointed me out as the person who asked for bottled water. I never drink bottled water anywhere. I resent being pointed out over an issue I had nothing to do with. People in our group mentioned how weird it was and what a waste it was that water was being poured from freshly opened bottles. So, before anything is ordered, be really clear about what kind of water you want. If you see a bottle and didn't order it, let them know immediately. I have read this is one of the biggest scams in so called up scale restaurants. We got scammed a 130 bucks worth. But, they got no tip on a $1200+ bill.   Our food was cool and cold for some and my enchiladas were tasteless. No spice or flavor just like the margaritas. I'm not picky unless picky means you want your food to be served the correct temp and your cocktails not to taste like water with lime.   The only good thing was the salsa. I loved that but feel scammed big time. And managers, don't offer me free food etc after reading this. I won't be back and I do not recommend this restaurant.",

The Shredded Beef Taquitos had just the right amount of crispness, and just the right amount of sauce so they didn't get soggy.  The Tres Enchiladas Del Mar came with three seafoods: crab, lobster, and shrimp, under a tasty sauce.  Quesadilla with Grilled Chicken was stuffed and quite filling.  The waiter was attentive and friendly, changing out our silverware as the appetizer plate was switched out for our main courses.  The only downside is that this place is popular and quite crowded, so there was an hour-long wait for a table for two. We'll probably make reservations the next time we visit.  Recommended.",

We had to order several of each. I ordered the carne y camerones which was $60. Very tasty but expensive!  If you are looking for casual Mexican this is not the place.  If you are looking for tasty expensive Mexican food and you want to impress your date then this is your spot.    The ambiance is great as it is open to the casino so you can easily people watch. If you have s large group and its the weekend I would suggest making a reservation.  You can also order food at the bar or the lounge area.",

We literally walked to the hostess at 11:45 p.m. and she was able to seat us. The next night though, we walked by and the restaurant was packed, so it might be wise to make a reservation. The chips and salsa, along with the margarita, were delicious.   The food here was good, but could have been better if some had not been overcooked. I had two tacos: one shrimp and one carne asada. The shrimp taco was perfectly cooked and really delicious. The carne asada was a pass: the meat was good but it was literally meat, avocado, and a little bit of onion, which made the taco too dry. I did like the sides of rice and beans though. The BF had the lobster enchilada. The lobster was a little dry and overcooked, and it was hard to taste the lobster with everything else going on in the dish. We wouldn't order this again.  Overall, it was a good experience, but too pricey in our opinion. I don't think most people will spend $$$ for tacos and enchiladas. I would only stop by again for drinks and some chips and salsa.",

I never had a cocktail when I was there and (Vegas had hit me a little too hard the night before) I can only imagine the margaritas are out of this world. The best thing about it, is the ambience. It is a very cool interior, as most Vegas restaurants have. I am a big fan of this place and I wonder what the lunch menu would look like. I stay at Vdara a lot and I dine at Aria and Cosmo a lot!

We mentioned the music was a little loud and did not expect anything would be done, but the manager came over and asked if we were okay with the volume after he turned it down in our section. Small things like this go a long way. It's a high end Mexican restaurant in a nice casino (The Aria) so it is priced accordingly. I would recommend you splurge and treat yourself. They have the best salsa I've ever had and I'm a fan of the Jalapeno Margarita.",

Staff was WONDERFUL every single time we came. The frozen mango margarita was seriously one of the best I have ever had. Being from Texas, where we judge one another and restaurants silently on Salsa, I was blown away with theirs. I even asked if they sold it by the bottle. I will always make it a point to come here when I am in town!",

It was huge with seating for over 20 people make of wooden and metal but quite exquisite.  The service was spectacular.  The servers/waiters attended to every detail.  Water was always full, drinks never lacking and overall amazing service.  While I wasn't drinking alcohol, the pineapple juice I ordered was one of the best I've had.  The menu was extensive with a great selection.  I ordered something simple, chicken fajitas and they were not simple in taste at all.  The chicken was wonderfully seasoned, the flour tortillas were warmed and toasted just right.  The guacamole was more perfect.  For dessert I ordered the flan.  I love flan and have had it all over the country.  This was one of the best I've had.  Highly recommend.  Someone in my party ordered the tres leches and they raved about it.  Overall, great meal and this Javier's is surely a step up in decor and experience.  Highly recommend visiting.",

The salad was the perfect sized with grilled chicken and cucumbers  The Asa Buco was tender and had lots of flavor!",

The land of $50 cover charges, $20 drinks, and $500 dinners replaced the $5 steak dinners and nearly free booze of long ago.  In exchange you get some very swanky places, gourmet food, and world class chefs...but you also get the worst kind of humans.  Javier's balanced all of this perfectly somehow.    The restaurant is in the Aria and is very sleek and modern.  The music, while a little loud, made the atmosphere upbeat and fun.  The service was solid, the crowd was upscale but not fake and, most importantly, the food was very good.  Now you're still paying $30 for enchiladas but in this setting you'd expect a lot more than $50 a person for dinner and a drink.  The margarita menu is pretty great even at $16-$18 each.    The Cabo Azul was a great dish and I left stuffed.  The chile rellano was my favorite part but all the way around the table the food was great.  I'd certainly come back.",

The food was GOOD and is consistent with the Cali locations, but the service leaves something to be desired. It was SLOW-EMPTY TABLE AFTER EMPTY TABLE and the server was slow and did not service our table-we ran out of water and had to beg someone to bring the check and then to pick up the payment once it was ready. It took at least 15 minutes for us to get salsa and chips. The staff did not seem to follow the model used in the Cali locations which have IMPECCABLE service and CARE about their customers and the service they receive at Javiers.   Now, I should say that I eat at Javier's Cali locations monthly and I am negatively affected by the review I have to give their Las Vegas location.   I called the next day to obtain information about having a party in their private room and was told that either the restaurant manager or the event manager would be able to help me but NEITHER or them was available. REALLY!!!!!! WOW!!! this is an extension of the horrible customer service received the day before expect I  would be spending thousands of dollars for it!!!!!!   To make matters worse when I went to the Manager the day after to get information about having a party in their private room he was very nonchalant and seemed uncaring about the inquiry. He walked us over to the room and told me to e-mail him to obtain the information about the room in writing. My thought, I am here, so why wouldn't you SEND ME the information since I am here to patronize your restaurant for a special occasion.  AGAIN!!!!!! Not a great experience and such a major epic fail for one of my fave Cali restaurants.",

When looking at the menu, your first thought, might be \"wow this is some overpriced Mexican food\" having eaten at some of my best meals throughout Mexico, I consider myself very selective when it comes to Mexican restaurants. But here at Javier's I was very pleased with my meal. From the start, the service was excellent. Our waiter was knowledgeable of the tequilas and the drink options, which was very helpful in selecting. We started our meal with the Ceviche de Pulpo (octopus) which was very good! The freshness of the ingredients, especially the pulpo, was amazing! Tasted the same as if I was eating it on the beach in Mexico. Our entree's were brought out quickly and the presentation was perfect. It didn't appear there was a single grain of rice out of place. The food was just as delicious as it looked. If I must find a flaw somewhere, my only criticism would be the beans. They were a little too simple and bland for me, but I still happily ate every single one. I am looking forward to returning, but because of the price, this might be more of a special occasion meal than a regular dinning experience and night out for me.",

We were expecting a step up from the Mexican food we get locally in the Bay Area, but it was mediocre at best.  The drinks were nice and the queso appetizer was interesting, but our crab and chicken enchiladas were mild in flavor and generic.  I had the crab, which was initially given to my partner, but due to the lack of flavor, it took us a couple bites to realize they messed up the plating. My enchiladas also had a few pieces of shell.   I still ate everything up as it was edible, but it reminded me of a Mexican restaurant where seniors go to eat because they don't have any taste buds left and it won't upset their stomachs. Except, seniors wouldn't eat here because the food is way too overpriced for what you get. Vegas is expensive and I understand the inflated prices, but I also expect an inflated experience.

Firstly we were told it would be 30-45 min wait to get a booth for 3 people and it was an hour wait after checking multiple times at the host stand and was told they would call us when our table was ready...never called. The ice water they serve is gross tasting unfiltered tap water and we ordered 2 cokes and a sprite and they came out as warm glass bottles and come to find out they cost $7 and $8!!! How ridiculously overpriced is that and no refills. I ordered the Cabo Azul and the only thing good was the shrimp taco. The Chile relleno was hard/crunchy and had nasty fishy tasting seafood inside. Told the server I didn't like it and he said sorry that's just the way it is cuz it's grilled. Replaced it with another shrimp n crab enchilada that wasn't good either. $42 wasted. The salad my mom ordered was tiny and $24. The sauce on my fiance's enchilada tasted like it was from a can. None of the food was hot and was extremely overpriced. Only thing good is the chips and salsa which isn't saying much. Also It's super loud with idiots screaming for no reason. Never coming back here!",

You can get better quality, larger quantity servings at any whole in the wall Mexican restaurant. The prices here are reallllly high for Mexican food. And i mean REALLY.   Other than the prices, we had to wait 2 hours to get seated. Not cool when you are starving. The hostesses were pretty rude when asking them if there is any way we can get seated sooner since we had a party of 11. My brother also burned his hand pretty badly on a hot plate. The servers brought the plates which are really hot, and after my brother grabs it and burns his hand pretty bad the server laughs and says \"oh ya it's a little hot\". He did not take that lightly since he was in pain. Not cool again. The only good thing I can honestly say about this restaurant was the cocktails. Very very good drinks at a decent price.  Overall, I had a pretty negative experience here from the hostesses, to the servers, to a family member being burned and being highly overcharged for ok food.  If you are in Vegas and want authentic food I would just yelp a little hope in the wall off the strip. You'll save around 20-30 dollars per person.",

The queso is fierce. It's liquid magma and gooey AF.   The margaritas don't disappoint, but I wouldn't call them special. Oddly, there is only one drink with mezcal. The waiter didn't know about this drink.   Chips are endless and the salsa is good, but nothing to yelp about... oops.   I would say 3 stars if this was a $$ establishment, but it's just not very good for the money.  Oh, the chainsaw art on the back wall is bone chilling. You have to see this.",

However, I have to say that our meals on this last visit were not great.  Three people out of the six people in our party ended up with serious upset stomachs later that evening and into the next morning that we attributed to our meals.  The food just wasn't as good as we had all experienced before.  Some undercooked and some lacked real authentic flavor.  Just overall fairly disappointing.  Not sure we would go back, unfortunately.  Maybe for cocktails, but likely not for dinner again.",

We sat in the bar area, had instant chips, salsa, and water, followed by quick drink service and prompt taking of our dinner order. No trouble getting a table in the late afternoon.  Location - inside Aria. Good vibe. Fun and slightly festive.   Food - fantastic. I had the chile verde. Wife had tacos. Everything was cooked just right. Tasty sauces and salsa. Excellent margaritas.   Only drawback - slightly pricey for the type of food, but somewhat expected for the location. Live a little and enjoy a good meal. You deserve it.   We will be back.",

    "text": "I was excited to visit Javier's during a recent weekend stay at the Aria, because I had heard incredible things about the SoCal-based restaurants - so I booked a reservation with high expectations. Out reservation was at 8:30pm on a Friday, and there was a bit of a wait at the hostess desk. We were seated at about 8:50pm.   That was a minor inconvenience, but a more pressing inconvenience was the noise level inside the restaurant. The music was almost impossibly loud. I've been in nightclubs with softer music. After the first course, my spouse and I essentially abandoned any attempts to be able to hear each other.   They have an impressive tequila menu, so connoisseurs will find plenty of options to savor. We tried one of their mezcal cocktails, which was excellent.  For a starter, we shared an order of Totopos (which worked out to be a traditional plate of nachos with shredded chicken); and it was delicious.   The menu is extensive, and we had a very hard time narrowing down to a final choice. If it had not been so loud, we definitely would have planned a second visit during our stay, to get to try our runner-up choices.   Ultimately, we settled on Camarones Mojo del Ajo (Mexican white prawns sauteed in butter, garlic, wine) and the Filete Costeno (8 oz. center cut filet mignon, and your choice of crab or lobster enchilada - I chose lobster - and served with two giant chiles stuffed with Cojita and Monterey Jack cheese).   The food was delicious, but at these prices for Mexican food (nearly $200 for two people - one cocktail each, no dessert), I feel like the meal should have been transcendent. Instead, it was was an excellent Mexican meal.",

If they can't make a proper margarita for $15 it's a problem. We got the shrimp ceviche which was tasty enough but not great. The carnitas were over cooked and over priced and the lobster enchiladas were again not good and over priced. The service was good and the place is beautiful but I still can't believe we payed $100 to eat that.",

Waited forever to be waited on and after finally placing our order a simple grilled shrimp taco with onions, cilantro and salsa on lettuce instead of a corn tortilla. Which should be very simple. When the food came out it was cold no seasoning and nothing on it. Pretty much a shrimp cocktail on lettuce. So I sent it back then the server tells me that's all they can do for me and places the dish in front of me. The shrimp is freezing cold. So I get the manager after waiting for 30 mins I had to raise my voice to tell a server I want to speak to manager (my gf has already finished her meal at this point btw) finally when the manager comes he starts trying to tell me this is how I ordered it and tries to give me insane attitude (Omar is the managers name) I canceled all the orders but my gf needed to pay for her meal so we now have been waiting for 30 mins and asked twice for it. I would not recommend anyone to eat at this establishment. Worst customer service I have ever seen in my life. Omar should be fired.",

If I were to complain about anything being overpriced here it would be their guacamole- as it was really pretty bland. As usual I filled up on chips and salsa by the time we ordered our entrees. As a result I didn't order anything special- just a two taco plate. I tried one chicken and one beef. Chicken was the better of the two. Nice crunchy shells that did not immediately disintegrate with the first bite. The surprise for me was the refried beans. Normally I find them to be awful and an unwelcome sight on my plate but the refried beans here were very good. The Chile Negro looked particularly appetizing. The interior of Javier's was very appealing with a cool wood carving on a back wall. Waiter was a bit pushy but efficient. I would like to go back and try some of the house specials.",

I was expecting a little more punch from the signature jalapeno margarita but after stabbing the chiles with my straw, I was able to extract a little more heat. The guac, spinach enchiladas, and Javier's salad were all good but not much more exciting than you get from your average good Mexican spot. I'll definitely go back the next time I'm at Aria because I love Mexican food but I wouldn't go too much out of your way to go here. Overall, go for lunch if you're staying at Aria.",

Even though it is in the middle of the casino, the noise level was very low, which we appreciated.  We started with the house special Margaritas.  The drinks were great with the fantastic complementary chips and salsa.  For our entries we had the Carnitas and Camarones al Mojo de Ajo.  Both were delicious.  The pork was very flavorful.  The shrimp were HUGE and cooked perfectly.  Our server Billy and the entire staff were very attentive and provided excellent service.  This place will do very well.

Surprisingly our wait to be seated wasn't that long but getting our food was a whole another story. We waited for fifty minutes until our food came and then service became nonexistent. My wife tried mentioning to the waiter about how long the food took and was basically told if we wanted him to take our food back and ordered cancelled. Lol. Crazy. What do u do. Needless to say I know I won't be going back there and. I'm sure neither will our friends.",

The service was not the best, but manager Julie made up for it.  We were seated at a table and asked to move about 10-15 minutes later because a large party was coming in.  After other frustrations with our hotel, this was an annoyance for us.  At our new table the staff forgot to bring me water and then later on in the meal someone took the salsa away as I had just grabbed several chips to dip in to it.  Julie did get us a round of drinks and dessert.  What I appreciate even more is that she listened to our frustrations and made us feel valued.  I will definitely come back again.",

This has never happened to me before at any Mexican restaurant. Javier's really has its stuff together!!!  AND the food is delicious. Really good to share and a ton of options.  Definitely a destination spot. Can't wait to try the California location.",

    "text": "I loved the ambiance and decor in this restaurant. Absolutely stunning. They have a massive hand carved piece towards the back, the rest of the walls throughout looked like salt walls, and the shape of the pillars gave it a cathedral feel.  Upon arrival (with a reservation) we waited at least 10 minutes. I didn't like how there was no seated waiting area, you're just standing, in the casino.  The lady who sat us was not friendly, didn't care to engage in any conversation or even give eye contact. Our waiter seemed as if he was sarcastic with us, like he was forcing himself to be nice. There was an incident where he seemed to be agitated that he had to repeat himself.  For drinks we ordered the signature Javier over ice with a salt rim. That was one strong drink! Very delicious.  The chips and salsa was also very delicious. I loved that the salsa had a nice garlic taste with a bit of spice.  For an appetizer we had the shrimp ceviche. It comes on a plate topped with Serrano peppers. It was just okay. It was a little fishier than I expected and the shrimp tasted as if was soaked in salt. For my main course, we ordered the pollo asado and the Cabo azul. I didn't try the pollo asado so I can't give a review on it, but it came with a side of guac, which was great. Very fresh. My Cabo azul was good. Very unique eating lobster enchiladas, I'd order it again. The shrimp taco had great flavor, the black beans and rice were very authentic also. For dessert we had Pastel De Chocolate. It was very delicious, the cake has a fudge texture. Regular vanilla ice cream inside a churro-like bowl. Overall the expierence was just okay and the food was good, but not stellar.",

Decor is updated and when you're in it, you feel like you're in a hip, cool place. This is great for a group, or one on one date, or even dinner w your parents.   Food & drinks are incredible. THE BEST CHIPS & SALSA EVER! Seriously. I'm a harsh critic and it isn't easy for me to say that. I could eat a basket on my own. The drinks are good too, they have about a dozen margarita flavors, try the jalapeno! They are a little pricey ($15) and not that big. The food is incredible. It's not your typical Mexican restaurant that basically covers everything in cheese and red sauce. It's light, fresh, and has unique flavors.   I've been to the Javier's in Newport, Irvine, and now Vegas and I can tell you, they are consistent, delicious, and hands down the best Mexican restaurant.   Only thing is, be prepared to pay up. The average food plate is about $30-$35, margaritas are $15, and guacamole is $13 (I think), so dinner and some drinks for 2 will easily run $120. Not bad but a little high for Mexican food - just a heads up so you're not surprised.",

Our waiter Javier was very nice and hot!   We started with guacamole and i would rate it an 8/10. I usually like my guacamole with more like and some spice. The portion was small for the $12 price. Chips and yummy salsa made up for it though.   Our food took a little longer than expected and we didn't order anything complicated. But the food was worth the wait! I ordered the Chile Verde (tender pork in green tomatillo sauce) and it was delicious. A little salty but the rice and beans balanced it out. A few things were wrong with our order but we didn't mention it. My friends ordered the carne tampiquena, soft tacos and shrimp enchiladas. We were so full and pleased with our choices.   They served premium tequila and the margaritas were on point! We ordered a mango, pineapple and rosa margarita. Martinis were good too. Drinks start at $15, which is about average for nice restaurants in Vegas.   The restaurant decor is rich in dark wood, dim lighting, and huge floral arrangements. Everything flows well together. They have this cool tequila tree displaying their selection. Beautiful! Would definitely come back for another special occasion. Thank you, Javier's!",

Last visit I had the cheese enchilada and crunchy beef taco combo... great meal!   We had a party of 8 for a bachelorette party and they were very accomodating. Our reservations were on time and our server was great! It was one of the girls birthdays so to make sure her birthday didn't get over shadowed by the bachelorette party we had arranged for a birthday cake to be delivered there (from a separate baker in the Aria) and it was ready as a surprise with a lighted candle after our meal. There was a cake cutting fee per person of about $4 per person I believe which I already knew so that didn't come as a surprise.   Great experience, food, and cocktails - exactly what I expect from this swanky Mexican restaurant!",

Once the order was placed, the food then took 45 minutes plus to come out but by then our drinks were empty and our server never asked if we wanted refills.

I was surprised to see that they offer chips, salsa, and guacamole free! Yum!  The specialty cocktail menu had interesting margarita drinks. I sampled the Jalapeno margarita one of our party ordered and it was tasty. For entrees we all ordered something a little different. I ordered the Fajitas de Carne o Pollo it was just ok.

The were both yummy, 12 to 16 bucks each, they better be be huh.  We had the guacamole, excellent and simple recipe. Then we split the azul plate crab enchalda, relleno, and taco, i also ordered a chicken taco on the side. Because Im always afraid of leaving hungry. The food was so rich and delicious we could barely finish. Yeah, its a little pricey, but great food, great service,  great experience. What more could you ask for on the strip. Cant wait to visit again",

The restaurant is beautiful and chic.   The hostess sat us quickly (we made reservations weeks in advance) and put us in a comfortable booth.   We ordered:  QUESO FUNDIDO:  - the melted monterey jack cheese was topped with chorizo and chile. It was a rich rich rich appetizer. We opted for the flour tortillas which tasted home made.   BEN MARCO MALBEC:  - this was a pleasant red wine that went well with our meal that night  CAMARONES AL MOJO DE AJO:  - there were 4 good sized shrimp to this order. The shrimp had a special garlic butter and wine sauce. The sauce was a bit bland. The order came with rice and I paid extra for a side of vegetables.  CARNE TAMPIQUENA:  - New York steak #1 prime center cut 6oz grilled, accompanied $34 by a mole chicken enchilada and taquito. Served with guacamole and refritos. The steak was a bit tough but the enchilada and taquito were tasty.   ENCHILADAS :  - I can't remember what friend ordered but hopefully the pic of the dish helps  Service was nice and helpful. There was no rush for us to finish the meal and the restaurant setting/decor was just so pretty.",

Firstly, the prices are jacked up because of course it's Vegas.  I ordered the Chile Relleno Picadilla and in the description, it stated the Chile being stuffed with ground beef, cheese, peppers, and potatoes.  When I cut into my relleno, there was nothing but GROUND BEEF.  I opened and picked at it with my utensils ans I see nothing else.  I asked my waiter about the ingredients and he INSISTED the potatoes are finely chopped.... I'm just thinking, DO YOU MEAN PURRED BECAUSE I DON'T SEE OR TASTE ANYTHING ELSE?! the dish was  $26 too so I expected much better attention to the preparation. He didn't even bother to check my plate and tried to convince me otherwise. My concern fell upon dead ears.  Needless to say, I lost my damn appetite trying to eat it because I hate wasting food. I hope the cooks take better care of making the meals.  I won't be ordering that dish again.    The silver lining:  the salsa was AMAZING AND SPICY.  Save your money and go to an authentic local Mexican joint.",

You're missing the outdoor seating and cafe lights. But service, drinks, and great food are still what they offer.   I always get the seafood chimichanga (fried burrito). It's not soggy here-- they don't put it in an Olympic size swimming pool of sauce. It stays crunchy from first bite to last bite.   Complimentary chips and salsa.

Home to many delicious Mexican and Tex-Mex restaurants with gargantuan portions.  None of which have nearly the prices that Javier's holds.  Granted, none are on the \"Strip\" as well.  Nonetheless, I feel that everything on the menu should have a lower price point.  Sure, you're also paying for ambiance and atmosphere.  And in those two areas, they excel.  It's dark, sexy, and high-energy.  It's a place to see and be-seen.  I love these things and I loved being here.  But the service... bleh.  And the food is good, not great.  I have higher expectations when things are more expensive.  Unfortunately this is where there is a disconnect.  We ordered guacamole for the table which was a disappointment.  I ordered the steak fajitas, which I recommend... but unfortunately they didn't blow me away.  I give Javier's four stars.  Price and service kept it from getting a five.   Javier's is great for dates.  Poor for foodies.",

As far as the food is concerned it's absolutely the best Mexican food I have had so far. The dining room service is top notch and the staff is very knowledgable about the menu. The front receptionist was cranky and I thought for a minute she might own the place but I was wrong. She was very rude but everyone has a bad day. I can't take it away from the rest of the staff who are very humble. (MGR) if your reading this, hiring a pretty face is great but do some one on one training so they know how much their snobby attitudes towards customers can hurt the overall greatness of your establishment. I recommend this place to put on your bucket list of must eat places. Keep up the excellent cooking. Cheers!",

    "text": "Went on a date to Javier's and oh, what a horrible experience. Poor service, overpriced food, & mediocre, at best, quality.   Poor Service: The restaurant was at maybe 10-20% capacity, so a restaurant inside Aria and priced at this level, one would expect decent service, not so. We did not receive a glass of water or cocktails (ordered soon after sitting down) until well after the food had arrived and a complaint was made. After the complaint, the server went to speak with the manager and all we got was a glance, smirk, & no apology or anything to remedy the service  Overpriced Food:  $120 for 2 people including 1 drink each is an expensive Mexican joint. Now don't get me wrong, we were fully aware of the price going in, but when one can get better service & food for $100 less...  Food Quality: All the food came out luke warm, and the chile relleno, undercooked. Actually, the re-fried beans did come out hot, 10 minutes after the rest of the food had already been dropped off.  Cutting into a chile relleno the consistency of rubber, using a butter knife, does not make for an enjoyable meal. After the waitress dropped off the food, she did not check up on us again until the re-fried beans were dropped off, It was then that she asked if everything was okay, and while we did mention the inedible relleno, we did not feel like waiting for another to arrive.   By the end of the meal, it was clear both my girlfriend and I were more than disappointed with the overall experience. We thought they may take care of at least the drinks or take a bit off the overall bill...nope, full bill & no apology.",

To start, margaritas were perfectly strong, chips were warm, and salsa was  delicious and had a kick to it.  For the food, we tried the nachos with shredded beef, steak picado, and arrachera.  All were cooked perfectly and served with fresh tortillas.  The server was nice but not overly attentive, yet there were enough other team members that we never really had to wait for anything.  The menu is large for those of you who are more on the picky side.",

Let me list a few places that serve better Mexican food than this place:  Chipotle, any local taco stand, and 1000's of small independent Mexican restaurants.  The food here is remarkably average and super overpriced.    We only ate here because we were in meetings all day and didn't want to venture outside of the hotel for dinner.  I can only deduce that captive hotel guests are the reason this place stays in business.",

    "text": "One of the worst most expensive Mexican restaurant I have ever been to. I live in Los Angeles and am used to good Mexican food and this was a disaster. I think I could find a taco truck that serves better Mexican food. The only good factor was the martini but at $17.00 it still left a lot to be desired. I ordered a chipotle chicken that was tiny, ice cold and at $28.00 a complete rip off. I had to send the meal back and was told it would only take a couple of minutes to get my Pollo Asado. Twenty minutes later I had not gotten it and my guest had already completed their meal. When the dish finally arrived it was a plain chicken breast, a side of beans, and a Chile pepper. It looked like something you would get at Baja Fresh.  Our bill was $85.00 for two entrees and two martinis. At these prices you would expect something unique. I have had better food at Chipotles and spent$ 10.00.",

    "text": "I am a really big fan of Javier's and I recommended this place for dinner for my out of town group. I hyped everyone up and I was pretty hyped myself to have dinner at one of my favs. It started out with dinner reservation that were set for 7:00pm. We arrived at 7:00 and had to wait for 20 mins to be seated as they claimed they had to prepare our table. We got seated at a booth that was way too small for our group size. By the way there were several tables and other booths that were surrounding that one which were empty, so basically not very busy at the time, so not sure why we had to wait the 20 minutes. Because our booth was to small they moved us to another table that was more appropriate for our needs. We then ordered drinks and guacamole. Our drinks came extremely fast, followed by chips and salsa. The waiter came back to get another drink order, so I asked what happened to the guacamole? I'll check on it he said. 10 more minutes goes by and still no guacamole. The waiter comes back and ask if we want more drinks? Still no guacamole, so I ask him to cancel it. I abruptly told him, I can't understand what takes so long to get guacamole. I said you keep bringing out the expensive drinks, why can't you grab the guacamole? He replied with I'm really sorry sir it's my mistake the guacamole is in the back prepared and all someone needed to do was bring it out. He now comes back with drinks and I ask, so why does that table across from us have their food when they ordered 15 minutes after us? He replies with, honestly what you ordered takes longer to prepare. Good answer I guess. So finally our food arrived, but only half our order. He says yours will be out shortly. 3-5 minutes later the rest of the order shows up. Well to my surprise mine, that takes so much longer to prepare is almost ice cold. I'm not sure I understand why considering mine was the reason for the delay. He said I'll tell the manager you are not satisfied. So we all finish our meals and no manager. I had to flag the waiter down to get the check. I'm convinced it was a bad night. However as a consumer I have a choice of where I dine and I most likely will not be dining here soon, if ever again.",

    "text": "If you're staying at any nearby hotels and are craving Mexican, this is a worthy choice whether you're looking for simple fare such as enchiladas or a Mole dish.    The latter is one that I particularly choose to critique to see if it meets my expectations.  It's a dish that is particularly challenging to make since it consists of an average of 20 ingredients if properly made and includes a variety of spices but most importantly:  chocolate, chili pepper, sesame seeds, tomatillos, garlic, and cumin to name a few.  It typically is served over meat such as poultry or pork.   Now you may think chocolate and chili peppers?  Yes, together they combine to make a unique taste that is not too hot nor too sweet.  It's an ideal combination of made correctly.    Now the mole poblano at Javier's was very good but didn't quite hit the mark for me since it was a bit too watery and didn't contain the spices I had hoped to hot the palate. The sauce was too bland and didn't have the hint of chili pepper that makes this dish so unique.   The presentation was superb and was best served with corn tortillas.  The chicken was moist but this too was bland.    As for the appetizer, I recommend the guacamole.  Chips were good but cool to the touch and best served warmer in my opinion.  Buen provecho!",

Very fresh chips and tasty salsa with a little kick to it. Yum.  The menu has a variety of items and prices. We went with the combination dinners because that's just what you do at Mexican restaurants. I was seriously Impressed with the quality and taste of everything I had. The shredded beef taco was fantastic and full of beef and cheese. No skimping on it.  So yes-pretty spends for a combo dinner, $25, but delicious food and super attentive service. It felt like we were in a fine dining restaurant. Great food, fantastic drinks and amazing service. We will definitely be back.",

    "text": "The wife decided to go here for a night out on the town. Great decor, good music, and attentive staff.  Quality of food Was great but overpriced. $32 for crab and shrimp quesadilla and same pricing for steak fajita's. I understand it's Vegas, but sheesh.  I must say though, the quality of the ingredients some what off sets the pricing, but the portions are regular.  I ordered the Javier margarita and I was disappointed by the quality as it tasted like a margarita from Applebee's versus a high end Mexican restaurant. I must say they made up for it with the Organic Margarita I reordered. Overall I give it 4 stars for the quality and taste of the food. But be prepared to pay $100+ for you and another person for 2 entrees and 2 drinks.  I would Definitely visit considering it's in the Aria and the experience is worth it. Great place to take the lady and people watch. Staff is nicely appointed as well.",

My bf had some tacos with guac which was great and they gave us a big bag of tortilla chips and salsa on the side to go! Definitely recommend this place. Been here a few other times and have yet to be disappointed. They play good music and the lights are pretty dim but that's no problem. Will def return.",

Came as a walk in and took about 20 mins for a table which isn't bad at all. we sat at the bar and ended up staying there and eating (they serve full menu at the bar). This bar is so beautiful. Has these gorgeous ropes all starting from the top and wrapping around the bar it's absolutely beautiful!!  They have a great selection of wine and every liquor you can imagine! The bartender was so cool he was showing us the most expensive drinks (a patron is 1,000 per glass)  They start you off with bottomless chips and salsa and you can order their gauc on the side! We both ordered the special of a enchilada and a taco for 25 bucks which is pretty reasonably priced. You can customize how you like your enchilada and they let you even have half and half red and green sauce. Their refried beans are the best I have ever tasted, super authentic!   Love this place and it's definitely my top 10!",

Being from Los Angeles, I will say when it comes to Mexican food, my expectations can be high.I understand at a nice hotel, higher prices are expected, but I would hope that the quality and taste of the food would match, and they surely did not. Great concept with the fusion, but very lacking in flavor. More \"Americanized\" for lack of a better word.  The guacamole lacked substance and flavor, as did the beans and rice. Enchiladas mariscos weren't bad, but also lacked in flavor in the sauce. Chopped salad was very blah.  The drink menu however was very creative and unique. I enjoyed all of the drinks I tried, including the pineapple margarita. Definitely a place I wouldn't mind coming back for a drink.  This location can get very busy, and the service can suffer. A couple people at our table got their orders wrong, or did not get all of their order served to them. It was difficult to get our server for the check, though when they did interact with us they were very friendly.",

The bar is okay too, but it's a walk up from the casino floor, so it's a little chaotic and near smoke, but does serve some food items offered in the restaurant.  During this stay at the Aria, we dined at the restaurant once and wound up at the bar 3 times (don't judge, but I may need to detox!).    On the restaurant visit, we didn't make a reservation & had a party of 8, so we had a 45 wait; which wasn't too bad considering how busy it was.  Once we were seated, service was on point.  The Javier's shaken margaritas were muy Bueno.  The chips and guac were fresh and addictive.  Javier's Chopped Salad- salad veggies, avocado, & cheese with chicken, shrimp, or skirt steak (we got shrimp) was delicious.    Filete Consteno- 8 oz Filet Prime Center Cut with dungeness crab or Maine lobster enchilada (I got the crab) was SO good.  I generally don't order a steak at a Mexican restaurant, but maybe I've been missing out because my filet was cooked and seasoned perfectly.  The crab enchilada was also very tasty.  According to the menu, my filet was \"corn-fed in Omaha, Nebraska, center cut and aged to perfection, then hand selected for JAVIER'S by protein specialist Raul Sanchez of Newport Meat Company\".  I'll buy it, because it was awesome.  For some reason, I didn't care for the grilled chicken quesadilla.  Someone ordered it at dinner and also at the bar and I didn't care for it either time.  The taquitos and crispy chicken tacos however were very good.",

I have gone here on two separate occasions and have been relatively impressed with the drinks and entrees when it comes to taste and presentation.   The enchilada entree was delicious while the quesadilla platter left a lot to be desired. I highly recommend the mango margarita with a salt rim if you're looking for a sweet beverage that'll slowly creep up on you! Overall, if you're looking for upscale Mexican food then this is definitely the place to go. It's got a full-service bar as well as a restaurant. They also have a private room if you're planning an event. For us, we celebrated my boyfriend's brother's graduation.  (40/100--2018)",

It felt like it was blended and soft, whereas I prefer my guac to be a litte more chunky.  My friend and I both got the Lobster Enchiladas and it was DIVINEEEEEE.

I had the carne asada (steak) with the chile relleno (stuffed pepper) and it did not dissapoint.  Best meal we've had in a while!  Last, for what they're know for. We were out for a good time so we literally tried every margarita they had to offer. They were all delicious, but our favorites were the guava and the cucumber margaritas.  They were a perfect blend and while they were decently strong, we didnt mind because the flavors were balanced so well!  Recommend to make a reservation as it does get really busy.

It's was nice and prices can be expensive.   We ordered the seafood ceviche and some combination dish(I totally forgot what it was it was chicken) and some fajitas along with some pineapple margarita. Let me tell you, they have one of the best margaritas there! I had a few ;D. For three fish and four margaritas, our tab was around $150-160, not including top.   The service was great and they do offer chips and dips for free while you are waiting for your food. My husband says the ceviche there was the best he had ever eaten. We will definitely be returning!",

This is a great place to go with big group to enjoy a dinner before a night out on the strip.    Although it is quite expensive for Mexican food, I have never been let down by any dish I have ordered here.  My go to order is La Tablita (para dos personas). Prepare your own tacos with your choice of $50 carne asada, carnitas or grilled natural chicken at your table. Served on a wooden platter with all the condiments: arroz, refritos, jalapenos, salsa fresca, guacamole, rajas, grilled green onions and your choice of warm tortillas.  This platter is enough to fill up 2 people easily and brings the cost to $25 dollars per person for the main entree.    I HIGHLY recommend ordering some Ceviche de Ahi and Guacamole as appetizers for the table.  The guacamole is made right in front of you and is absolutely fantastic.  Javier's is known for their notoriously good alcoholic beverages as well.  My favorites on the menu include:  margarita de granada (pomegranate), margarita de pepino (cucumber) and margarita de jalapeno.  You can also order from an assortment of martinis (although I am not a big martini drinker) I hear that they are excellent.    Be prepared to spend a bit of money if you come to Javier's an are ordering appetizers, an entree and drinks but I assure you, it is well worth it.  I am in love with the food and ambience of this restaurant.",

This includes management.   The decor is modern but has traditional Mexican elements. I like the design but wished lighting was a bit brighter.  The food:  Guacamole - the order was like two small scoops of gelato. While it was good, it did not blow me away.   Queso Fundido - this was cheesy good and I would order it again. I would also ask them to make it spicy somehow. It would have been better with bits of Chorizo in it.   Octopus and Shrimp Ceviche - Both were fresh and tasted great. Portions again were small. These would be good as tapas style plates.   Carnitas - The carnitas was surprisingly a larger portion. It came with a couple of medium size pork ribs and a chunk of pork butt. The flavors were good and there was a crunch from the deep-fried pork butt. It came with guacamole, tortillas, salsa, and pureed beans. These were some of the best beans I've had because it was luscious and creamy... I think from either lard or butter.   Other people on the table had the Camerones Ranchero, Seafood Enchilada, Carne Asada and everyone seemed to like their dishes.   No desserts because we were too full from everything else. But the server did tell us they has fried bananas and flan.   In the end, I do not see myself coming back. There are a lot of other good local Mexican restaurants. But for tourists that want Mexican food, they don't really have much of a choice.",

Chips and salsa arrive quickly as we decide on a casa margarita and jalapeno margarita.  Fancy handshaken margaritas for the win. I also try the Mexican margarita which is with fresh lime only which I prefer to the jalapeno margarita.  My shrimp Javier's chopped salad was yummy!! They managed not to overcook the shrimp.  My friend loves her crispy taco and enchilada combo.  Wish we could come back soon!! Aria has a great variety of spots.  This restaurant was happening and we really appreciated the lovely service and spacious booth for 2 female diners.",

We arrived around 7:00 on a Thursday night and our party of three was promptly seated even though the restaurant was quite full.  The dark wooden tables, rope canopy over the bar and metal tree of tequila lends a dark and sexy feel.  The chips and salsa are amazing, salsa is very hit or miss and this one was a hit. Food ordered was seafood (crap and lobster) enchiladas, one with red sauce, one with verde. Excellent. The chicken fajitas were good, they are not delivered on a sizzling platter as I think standard for fajitas, but whatever, they were still good. The chicken mole was commented as very good, too. Margaritas were bueno.  The service was great, the server was friendly and he accommodated the no dairy requests, even double checking the order to make sure.  I'd return to Javier's, even though I dread casinos in general.  Total bill, minus tip, $85-ish.",

I asked the waiter which pork dish he recommended, and I could not have been happier, because the Carnitas (Carnitas Fresh natural pork prepared Michoacan style. Served with refritos, guacamole, salsa quemada, cilantro and warm tortillas. - $27) was Awesome!  Atmosphere: Possibly the nicest designed location. It is in the Aria at City Center. Very cool interior, with intimate booths. The private room for large parties looks awesome.  Food: I really enjoyed mine so much that I ate too much. I tend to eat lightly at one time, and am a big box the rest to go fan. In vegas tho you ain't carrying to-go boxes around all night.. haha.  Drinks: Margaritas rocked! I only had 1, but wanted more *pants like a dog*  Staff: Professional, friendly, great.  Would give 5 stars, but others at my table were not as wowed as I was by their food. We had plenty on our plates to share around. Hearty, but not excessive portions.",

The meal quality is amazing- it is very fresh, very high quality ingredients and the atmosphere although is loud, has great attention to detail. The chips served when you are seated are the best out there. The chicken nachos have an incredible cheese, moist pieces of chicken and are baked to perfection.  Drinks are made strong- service is acceptable and meals served quick (although clearly made to order still). This is an example of what being in a 5 star resort like Aria should be - the prices are higher but 100% worth the cost. Wish that other Aria restaurants would take notice of how to operate a great location.",

Perfect heat, tomato, and chili combination with just the right consistency - We had the ceviche trio.  The shrimp ceviche was my favorite, which is rare because most shrimp ceviche has little flavor.  Javier's version was rich, tangy, and spicy - I had the costilla de res.  It was nice and tender.  The sauce was delicate, which you normally don't find in Mexican fare. I loved it.  Something needs to be done with the potatoes though.  Didn't seem to match well - The rice and beans were below average - Ok service.  Very polite, but there was a lot of confusion around which tables ordered what",

Having been there one time before with some work friends it lived up to the previous experience and then surpassed it.    Come for the food, and stay for the drinks.  I live in Los Angeles and we have all kinds of Mexican food, and while Javier's was as fresh as the freshest I have experienced there is something unique about the flavors while still satisfying any traditional urges you might have.  I had the carnitas plate and it was hands down the best carnitas I have had anywhere.  This is my favorite dish at most places so I have tried it dozens and dozens of times from many restaurants and it was to die for.  It was cooked perfectly.  We also split the Javier's Ensalada and it was superb, very fresh.  For drinks we tried a few of the Margaritas but our unanimous favorite was the cucumber jalapeno margarita.  The exact name is escaping me but it was very refreshing.  Finally, their chips and salsa was perfect.  Definitely don't miss this place!",

    "text": "Visited on 5/30/17 for dinner at 7pm. Made a reservation, but it wasn't really necessary...  It's sad when have your best restaurant visit on your first night in Las Vegas, but such was the case when we visited Javier's. Most would reserve their 5 star ratings for a stuffy, crusty, upscale restaurant - I'm giving my 5 to this one.   Javier's is located inside the Aria Resort and Casino, which is simply a beautiful property. The restaurant is easy to find, with it's oversize hammock ropes hanging throughout. The resort and casino has kind of a new hip vibe as does the restaurant. The restaurant is slightly dark and rich feeling.  The service was exceptional and the timing was excellent. Our waiter was Orlando, and he was excellent and welcoming.  I started with the ceviche de camarones (shrimp ceviche). I love ceviche and to tell you this was among the best I ever had isn't an understatement. The shrimp were incredibly fresh and the entire mix was on point. The one thing I truly appreciated is while I'm a ceviche fan, I'm not a huge avocado fan. But the avocados were diced into tiny cubes the same size as the other ingredients so, they were easy to eat.  Main course for me was the carnitas. Fresh pork with refritos and salsa quemada. Simple Mexican, but delicious. Wife had the filete antiguo, which she absolutely loved. Coupled with great service, the great food made the meal excellent.   As some other reviews likely state, the food is a bit pricey. For Mexican food in fact, it's high. But for the ambiance and the service - not to mention the suspension of judgement since you are in a high-end Las Vegas resort - it's a good deal.  Trust me - skip some of the other high name/high end restaurants and get a meal here. Javier's is the good stuff.",

It's a nice design, medium loud noise level, great decor.  But at the end of the day you are paying $100 per person or close to it for Mexican food.  Their food is not so cutting edge that it can justify charging what they do.  There are some decent menu items but everything is grossly overpriced from the drinks right on through the menu.  We had the octopus tostadas for appetizer and they were pretty good. Not great.  The main dishes were also good, but basically some prettied up versions of Mexican dishes.   If you don't care about your expense account, then it's serviceable. If you are forking out your hard earned money, you will be disappointed once you get the bill.",

The seafood inside the enchilada and the stuffed pepper was so overcooked it was rubber.  However, there was a seafood taco that came with my meal that was delicious.  Someone else in our party ordered the tabli, which is a large butcher block full of different kinds of meat.  The beef was delicious; however the pork and chicken were both very dry, tough and hard to eat.  The refried beans were absolutely disgusting and inedible.  I don't understand how this restaurant can get beans wrong.    Unbeknownst to me, my husband ordered bottled waters for the table.  I made a comment that it tasted like the tap water at our home, and he told it was bottled.  BEWARE!  The bottled waters they brought were bottles that were being refilled from a tap.  They were not labeled and were not opened in front of us (I'm sure that's because they are reusing the bottles).  The small bottles were 10$ each!  I don't know exactly what they are doing, but I highly suspect that it's some sort of scam.  I asked the waiter to bring me regular water so that I could see the difference, and the regular water actually tasted better!  hmmmmm.....  The music was so loud that it is very difficult to have a conversation with someone accross the table.  Definitely not the place for a date.  It was my daughter's last night before she left back for college and it was extremely frustrating not to be able to have a nice conversation over our last meal together.  I won't go back here unless someone else is paying.  As a local, it felt like a tourist trap.",

We sat at a table at the bar wait staff was friendly  and informative.  Suggested  the margaritas. Started with the jalapeno  margaritas  amazing!  Chips, salsa and guacamole  were good.  We had chicken  quesadillas  and beef enchiladas.  We had a fabulous  time.  Would recommend  for dinner and drinks lively  atmosphere",

Chile Verde, Shrimp Quesadilla, Carne Asada Quesadilla, and ceviche. The boyfriend also ordered a bloody mary, it was disgusting so we sent it back and ordered a shot of tequila instead.   Chile Verde, was passable. No thanks, two bites and we called it quits. The Carne Asada quesadilla was oily but I suppose perfect for the hangover he was nursing. The Shrimp Quesadilla was probably the only thing that we would order again. It was a decent enough size for the price. Lastly, the ceviche, eh. I'm from California, and I've had street ceviche that tasted much better.   Also, they do not have fountain sodas, so be prepared to pay 5 bucks for a bottled soda.   I understand that this is not the only location of Javier's and because the atmosphere was so nice, and the waitstaff super attentive, I would be willing to try this place again. Obviously, we were in Vegas so we weren't too upset about the prices, but if you're looking for quality food in Vegas, I'd pass on Javier's.",

I thought the food was great, however the ambiance was a little loud for a party our size (6) it was difficult to hear the other end of the table's conversation.  Decor was beautiful.  Started with the queso and guac. Both were good. Chips and salsa were good too, the salsa had a bit of a kick to it.  For my entree, I tried a sampler platter of a shrimp taco, Maine lobster enchilada, stuffed chile relleno. It was delicious!  This is upscale mexican food and the average entree was around $30. This was very similar pricing to all the restaurants in the aria hotel.",

However, I did get the jalapeno margarita and it was soooo spicy (too spicy for me, and I usually enjoy spicy jalapeno drinks). Over the course of close to an hour I only had a few sips. The bartender even dropped by to give my friend (almost done with her drink) a free drink (with no explanation). I should have spoken up, but I will opt for a nice glass of wine to enjoy this space next time.",

On a recent trip to Las Vegas, the restaurant was recommended but turned into the worst experience I have ever had. While the server was great, the food was delayed for over 30 mins and came out wrong then when it was sent back it took another 30 mins and came out wrong again. Upon discussing this with the person we thought was the manager, we quickly found out he was not in charge. When we asked to speak to the manager, we were told he was not willing to come to our table to discuss the events. This was the worst of all responses. We never got our meal and left with a horrible experience. This will be the last time we stay or go to an MGM property or restaurant.",

The food quality was just mind-blowing. The one thing I look for in restaurants is their ability to blow me away in any of several parts of the dining experience. I don't use this term loosely either.   The drinks (jalapeno margarita and margarita that had chambord and something else in it) were so perfect. The Seafood nachos with shrimp, guacamole, dungeness crab also blew me away. A must have appetizer. My date and I shared the most tender filet and lobster tail marinated in this incredible garlic, poblano, butter sauce that made it worth the $60 it cost us. Together, the bill including gratuity for 2 cost me $210 which was the most expensive dinner I ever had for 2 people..but it was worth it without any hesitation. Props to our server for being so friendly and chatting with us and helping us decide on our selections. I'm pretty sure his name was Juan. (he was hispanic, mid 20s, and ultra knowledgable).",

    "text": "This is a dark corner to enjoy.  My friend and I had a brief time to bridge one Strip destination and a ticketed show, so we ducked into Javier's for an appetizer and drink.    Javier's allure is its atmosphere as much as its convenient location in the svelte Aria.  Everything in Vegas that is worth seeking out is \"through the casino.\"  We passed raucous sports bars and slot machine cha-chinging walkups before choosing Javier's for its quieter mood.  It has metal studded ceilings, carved wood banquets, and heavy leather table tops and lounge seating  The piped in music was definitely an amusing background - looping on reggae during our hour's visit.    We added to the cosmopolitan mix by ordering French martinis - not cheap at $17 each.  A value totally underestimated until we rose to our feet and discovered the liquid power that could have launched us to  the ionosphere.  But since we only hoped to get to the show \"through the casino,\"  the libations were perfect rocket boosters.  Food served at the adjoining table showed impressive presentation.  I can only tell you about the chips that were served warm next to attractive cups of red and green salsa.  Speaking of feet.  Yes, see paragraph 3.  My friend was suffering from all those trips Through the Casino.  The kindly waitress dipped into her own purse and presented three bandaids to sooth the blister that surfaced while one toe fought with the other to be first on the escalator, tram, revolving door, taxi, carpet, marble floor, etcetera etcetera...An interesting, very girl-to-girl, hospitable way to earn a well-deserved tip.",

Our waitrress took forever to come over to greet us and our first drink order took 15 min to arrive. After that we ordered guacamole for an appetizer and then our entrees. The entrees arrived in about 10 minutes and at that time we ordered another round of drinks. 45 minutes later we finished eating... our guacamole never came and our second round of drinks hadn't arrived either. After a different waitress cleared our plates the manager showed up with our round of drinks and I made the comment \"oh we ordered those 45 minutes ago and we don't want them anymore. He literally put them all back on the tray, took them to the bar and dumped them out! He didn't once apologize that it took 45 minutes for 4 margartias or offer them to us since it took so long. Then we get the bill and notice all the drinks and guacamole were still on the bill when I brought it to the waiters attention she gave me an extreme attitude and took another 20 minutes to come back with the correct bill, never once apologizing. This restaurant and the Aria have lost my loyal business.",

    "text": "This place was disappointing! The service was fine and our waiter was friendly, but nothing spectacular. We went to dinner as a group of four and were promptly seated. The ambience wasn't bad, but we all hated how dark it was in the booth area we were in. We are all fairly young (mid-twenties to early thirties), yet felt like we had aged because it was so dark we couldn't read the menus printed on black paper. Turns out we weren't the only ones having issues as we saw other waiters turn on mini flash flights for other patrons to read their menus! Ridiculous.   We each had different margaritas and didn't think much of them. We didn't bother ordering additional rounds as we had all planned to. Can't remember the specific name of my dish, but the description in the menu sounded great so I ordered it. My friends had the beef fajitas. We got our plates and well... mine looked EXACTLY like theirs with the exception of having a small side of rice. A little frustrating when the descriptions AND prices were different. On top of that, the food was bland. I pretty much just poured the rest of the salsa (from the chips and salsa to start) to have some sort of taste. There was no flavor in anything and the steak pieces were dry and overcooked. It was truly a disappointing meal, especially given the price.   The only saving grace in this place were the chips and salsa. Those were definitely tasty, but that is not enough to return to this place.",

Got an early reservation but after shopping all day, we were plenty hungry.  Daughter ordered steak fajitas said they were the best she's ever had.  Hubby ordered the tres enchiladas and loved them.  I ordered the seafood plate with a  little of everything.  It had an enchilada, a fish taco & a chili relleno.  It was a lot of food, but we all managed to finish.  I also ordered one of the specialty martini's.  It was pretty good, but I hadn't realized it was $17!  That's the most I've ever paid for a drink, ever!  Usually expect to pay $12-13 for a specialty martini.  Service was great, ambiance is wonderful.  Love the decor!  Would definitely go back.",

I requested a booth and they sat us in the bar which was very noisy, when there were plenty of booths empty in the restaurant (and sat empty the entire time we dined).   Our server was very absent minded, she didn't really seem to be actually paying attention when we ordered, looking around the restaurant. Out of 2 entrees and 2 drinks the only thing that came correctly was one drink. Wrong dressing on the salad, wrong sides with the other entree, and my margarita had salt even though she asked twice and I said no salt. Server never came back around until we were done, and waiting, and getting irritated. Waited forever for the check, then she didn't include a room charge slip so we had to wait some more. Barely made our show when we should have had plenty of time.   The food was fine, nothing spectacular. The prices were not bad for Vegas, drinks were on the pricy side though. Probably won't be back next time, we'll explore other options for Mexican food.",

We went for a bachelorette party with 12 girls and they were very accommodating, went for a birthday and they made it extra special and even a regular dinner with no occasion feels like a special night out. The chips and salsa are addicting. My favorite item off the menu is the steak salad. Their cocktails are extremely strong, I had to ask if they would bring me some extra pineapple juice on the side so I can lighten it up a little. The prices are very reasonable for Vegas. Javier's never disappoints.   Note: Make a reservation and you won't have to wait. Speedy service, always!",

We just happened to stumble upon this one inside the Aria.  The food and drinks are delicious.  I have not been disappointed with anything that I have ever ordered.   I'm not a big Margarita person, but the Jalapeno margarita....BOMB!!   This restaurant is great for a group of friends or for just you and your special date.  Both locations are great, but I think I prefer the one in Vegas a little better.  Mainly because the one in Cali was super crowded and loud and the one in Vegas wasn't.  The next time I'm in Vegas I will definitely be back!",

Dim lights, GREAT music playing low in the background, & AMAZING service!  Aside from making sure we had EVERYTHING we needed, the server escorted my sister arm in arm to the restroom!! How awesome is that???? Now getting to the food.....SOOOOO GOOOOOD!!! We ordered the Queso Fundido, Chicken Taquitos, Seafood Nachos, Chile Negro, Lobster Enchiladas,Shrimp Tacos, Spinach Enchiladas & Enchiladas Suiza & ALLLLLL of it was AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS!!! Oh & the drinks & chips & salsa were equally amazing!! The chips & salsa were in the top 3 that I've ever had.  The margaritas were perfect & a little strong just like I like them.  My cousin ordered the Black Mamba drink & she said it was REALLY good & my other friend ordered the Lemon Drop that she said was good too. All in all, Javier's is definitely going to be a MUST visit every time I go to Vegas.",

    "text": "I cannot say enough about this place other than I really have nothing bad to say about it. I have eaten here probably around 10 times, and each time has been nothing short of fantastic.   The hostesses are ALWAYS accommodating with or without a reservation. On the off chance you have to wait a little bit (depending on when you go), the bar usually has ample space.   The service is spectacular. It honestly feels like the waiters/bus boys are watching your table constantly. I can honestly say they have never let our chip bowl even come close to empty before swapping it out with a fresh bowl...and they are endless. The chips come with salsa which is great, but if you're a regular you know to ask for ALL of their salsa options...they have a VERY spicy habenero and a mild tomatillo. They are also excellent at always making sure your water glasses are always full!  The food is unreal. I have never tried something I did not like. And, if they don't have something you want on the menu, they work with you to create it! My friend said he wanted the picture he saw on the strip which featured the chicken, beef, and veggie enchilada. That is not on the menu as an entree all together, and was only for picture purposes -but they made it happen. I have a few examples of this. If you have food sensitivities, or are gluten free you can easily find something you can eat, and if not, again - they will make it happen!  Some people are not a huge fan of the lighting - but I think the dimness pairs well with the decor and creates a sexy, intimate environment.   It is a but pricey, but you get what you pay for and it is worth it!  The bathrooms should be a little bigger based on the size of the restaurant, but it is not that big of a deal!  Love, love, love this place.",

    "text": "Javier's is muy bueno!    #1 best Chips and Salsa in my opinion in Las Vegas period.  I have been to every Mexican Restaurant in town.  Javier's is a little pricier than most Mexican restaurants but in my opinion well worth it.  If you are debating between Mexican Restaurants on the strip it blows Border Grill,and Diablos out of the water on every level.  If you are a Mexican food lover then i will say this is a must for you to try!  I have eaten here many times and have always had excellent professional service and a great experience.  The restaurant itself is beautiful and has the nicest mexican ambiance and decor i have seen.   The Food is excellent and what is really great about this place is that they have a lot of very sophisticated items on the menu that you don't typically find in most Mexican restaurants.   One dish thats different and I make sure somebody orders at the table  is the Camarones al mojo de ajo, or garlic shrimp. Another stand out is the Chile Verde special which is a pork dish and is most excellent.  I actually have them turn this into Chile Verde enchiladas when i go - a modification i highly recommend! :) The best appetizer is the chicken taquitos or the steak nachos.  The main dishes come with rice and beans and you have your choice of black/white refried or regular beans served in a cup.  Both are delicious! ( I prefer the white)  No matter what you select for your meal you will be very pleased.  They use all fresh ingredients and the kitchen definitely knows what they are doing.  Food comes out hot and perfectly cooked every time.     Buen Provecho!",

    "text": "Javier's is hit or miss at this location so that's why I gave four stars instead of five. I've been to them all practically, from Cabo, Mexico to Irvine to the one in the airport at John Wayne. Only Javier's I haven't been to is the one at Crystal Cove.   For whatever reason, sometimes the food at the Aria location tastes consistent with my five star reviews of all their other locations, and sometimes it just tastes off.   My first experience with this restaurant pissed me off and I almost didn't go back again. I ordered \"enchiladas de mariscos\" which is my favorite dish and what I order at all the other Javier's. I didn't think I even needed to look at the menu because I assumed it was the same as all the other locations, so I never bothered and just ordered away. I guess, in retrospect, I should have double-checked because the waiter brought me out chicken enchiladas instead of what I wanted. The second I tasted it I noticed something was not quite right but it was dark in there and I just assumed since this was a different Javier's and my first time, that maybe their cooks weren't up to speed out here in Vegas yet. The place was still somewhat new at the time. It didn't taste amazing like I was used to so I ate about half of one enchilada and then finally gave up, thinking another one bites the dust! I called the waiter over and told them that I was very disappointed with my dish (which I never do, for the record). I told him he must have brought me the wrong thing or the chef had no clue what was up and then he said, \"No, I brought you what you ordered, enchiladas suizas.\" and I said, \"No, I had ordered enchiladas de mariscos!\" So yeah, obvious miscommunication there! That explained the mystery of why it didn't taste right. However, the waiter didn't offer to fix the situation and instead told me not to tip him. No clue what that was all about. Maybe the management takes it out of the waiters' tips if they get the orders wrong. I dunno... I've never had that happen before. Just thought that was the most interesting customer service I had ever received to date, if you even want to call that customer service. So needless to say, I left there unhappy that night. Thank god I complained because had I not, I would have written this place off as a no go. And waiter guy still got a tip even though I shoulda stiffed him! I'm too nice...  Anyway... Note to everyone who is used to calling it Enchiladas de Mariscos: It's actually called \"Seafood Enchiladas\" here and only here. Why my waiter, who spoke Spanish mind you, didn't get this right is beyond me but whatever! Mariscos translates to \"seafood\". What's the problemo, senor? Since the staff doesn't get it, they should be told that at the other locations this particular dish is called something different so technically it has two names. And they should be told what that name is so as to avoid other Javier's professionals, like me, from getting chicken enchiladas when they want seafood. And one more thing, if the waiters get it wrong, they should credit you back the price of your dish or remake your food for you the right way, at least. None of that don't tip me BS because that still doesn't make up for your mistake!  Anywhoooo... hate to admit it but these aholes at Javier's sure make good food (sometimes at this location, not 100% consistent) so that's why I keep coming back and not boycotting, in spite of my bad first impression with this Aria location. And it's not like I'm about to take a four hour drive to Cali just to satisfy my Javier's craving elsewhere. So I guess they have me stuck eating here, from time to time, when my cravings hit.  I absolutely love their organic margaritas (cadillac style). I guess after a few of those I'm willing to accept any of the crap that jerk Javier wishes to dish at me. I'm such a sucker! Their chips and salsa are addictive so be careful. Mustn't be too full for when your entree arrives! Another thing, the atmosphere here is a 10! I love that dark, Guernica style carving along the back wall. This is a great place to take a date. *hint hint, nudge nudge* Hear that boys? Just pray that they don't get her order wrong or if they do, that your date is laid back.",

My mom and I were in Vegas on a girls trip and looking for something better than a fast food meal, but also not too ridiculously fancy and overpriced, and this was the absolute winner! We dressed more on the casual side of business casual and didn't feel out of place or looked down on like we did at some other restaurants. They give you chips and salsa to start out with (yay!). They have high end dishes as well as regular dishes to choose from. Delicious drinks. I tried the jalapeno margarita and it was amazing!! I couldn't decide between lobster enchiladas or shrimp enchiladas, so the waiter kindly let me get one of each without charging extra. He said \"no problem at all!\" and was such a sweetheart about it. Our waters were always full. We got a huge cozy booth all to ourselves. The ambience in their is dark, but so gorgeous and elegant. It's the type of place I would go for a casual dinner with my friend or boyfriend. But also nice enough to go to for a special occasion like a birthday, or bachelorette dinner. Highly recommend this place when you're in Vegas near the Aria hotel & casino.",

Their chips and salsa in the beginning was crisp and yummy as well. I loved the cups that had our ice water in it. It was a cute cup and I would drink water from it anytime !

They have lots of tequilas - both the standards you would expect as well as more unique varieties. You can't go wrong with any of the specialty margs offered but I recommend a classic Cadillac. The food was delicious - we had the enchiladas suizas and the Cabo Azul.",

The ambience lighting, mellow beat Spanish music & decorative architecture is a unique & pleasant combination. I proceeded to the bar alone for a Margarita or two before my girlfriend arrived to join me. The margaritas were very tasty & STRONG which added to the pleasant combination. My girlfriend & I enjoyed excellent service from both the bartenders & our waiter. My girlfriend & I were placed in a romantic setting booth which we enjoyed. The delivery of our food (appetizer chips & salsa/ plus entree) & drinks was timely efficient. We shared a taco platter & were both full of the amount of 1 entree which included 4 Tacos (2steak/2chicken) along with Spanish rice and refried beans. The food was delicious & filling. I paid with my MLife Rewards Credit balance and spent around $120 for us two which included 5 MARGARITAS Lol the price for margaritas was expensive but the dining experience will be well remembered",

The salsa is mediocre and so is the ceviche.  I'm Mexican so I know real Mexican food not \"upscale\" Mexican food.  I will keep trying maybe one day I'll find my favorite food item and stick to it !",

The excellent: Javier margarita, Jalapeno margarita, chips and salsa - all top notch.  The quest fundido was out of this world - rich, stringy cheese, mushrooms and spices with solid corn tortillas as a vessel. The pork with verde sauce was also wonderful. Tender chunks of pork and a complex verde sauce.   The OK: Catch of the day (halibut) Veracruz. The fish was over cooked.  The sauce was tasty but there was not enough for the portion of fish. Served with boring white rice. The red rice that accompanied the pork was just Ok as well - standard dive Mexican. Little flavor.   The terrible: Refried beans. Inedible. They tasted like glue.   I would go back for the drinks and queso. Pick wisely and you can have a wonderful meal.",

The seafood trio enchilada plate was underwhelming.  The lobster enchilada was fishy and inedible, the crab was very good, and the shrimp was just ok.  The Steak Picado was chewy and full of gristle.  The margaritas were very good though, which is to be expected when they're $18.  The music is about 50% too loud.  I'm now a believer that people who rate this place really high were drinking heavily.  The service staff were great, but the meal definitely did not warrant $150, not even close.",

I would rank it average. The chips were good but very greasy and the salsa was loaded with salt and very thin. I had the chicken chopped salad and it was very small not entree size like the waiters said. The salad was good tasting but again loaded with too much salt. The ambiance was very loud but you could not hear the casino floor. It was so loud with music you could not carry on a conversation. Mexican restaurants are a dime a dozen in this town there are many others better to try.",

From the time we arrived, the hostesses were extremely gracious in greeting us. The vibe and ambience was that Vegas, a little louder and grander but in a good way. The restaurant did a great job transporting you away and not feeling like you were in a Vegas hotel and Casino. Our servers was energetic and very personable. They made sure we never wanted for water or the chips and salsa that were endless go the point we were kind of full before the meal. The food was fresh and full of flavor. The plates are not massive portions and can be pricey but you know that going in so not and issue. The ambience and decor are amazing but not over the top in trying to hard to be super fancy. I highly recommend and will return next time I'm in Vegas.",

Unfortunately, after we were seated, it took about 30 minutes for out server to come to the table. My husband had to get another server to find our server Willie. Who then comes to the table and expand that he saw us eating and assumed our table was waited already. My 1 year old was the only one eating but she can't eat the food at Javier's. Willie did apologize but it was too late. We were already disappointed but did not let it show.  I did place my order to the dismay of my husband who just wanted to leave. But I was too hungry. I was ordered Enchiladas de Mariscos which was so delicious. It's just unfortunate that we had such a crappy first impression and did not return.",

We ordered  - Jalapeno Margaritas  - Queso Fundido - Camarenos Rancheros - Beef Fajitas  First of all, this margarita was wonderfully spicy, and delicious...if it wasn't mid day, I could have easily had another one...or two. The Queso Fundido is perfectly melted Monterey Jack cheese with sauteed onion, mushroom, and pasilla chile. It is then topped with chorizo and chipotle chile, and corn tortillas to wrap it up...so delicious. The Camarones Rancheros is one of Javier's most popular seafood dishes...there is a creaminess as the prawns are sauteed with garlic butter, but the dish is not at all greasy, it is surprisingly light, well-balanced, and refreshing with tomatos and cilantro. The Beef Fajitas at Javier's are some of the best I have experienced...oh, and the guacamole--so exciting!...tasty, with texture and bite.  All the staff was friendly and kind. I will come back to Javier's soon to taste other options to pair with my Jalapenos Margarita.  Walking through the Aria Hotel & Casino floor to get to Javier's is not a bad experience either. Aria is always well manicured for the seasonal occasions and seems almost smoke-free in the air.   p.s. I paid $13 to valet with the new fees in effect.  - 2017 Review #15 -",

    "text": "I've been here twice. Once, I just sat at the bar for lunch and ordered fajitas. Your mileage may vary, but they use the bottled real sugar Mexican Coca-Cola bottles, and I was only charged for one despite receiving three refills. I'm glad I wasn't charged for the extra bottles, because the one I was billed for was $6. The service and the food were great, although dangerously challenging their value with the high prices for most plates.  The high price issue faded a bit when my fiancee and I returned months later for dinner, where the place was packed and had a really cool social-meets-classy ambiance.  The menu needs SEVERE updating: At that meal, I was feeling like eating light, so I ordered the taquitos, which are billed in the menu as \"Beef or chicken.\" It doesn't even say cheese, but every taquito I've ever had in my life is just meat and cheese. When it came, it was covered in slaw, onions, guac and sour cream - things I guess that aren't uncommon in a Mexican restaurant, but things that I'm picky enough of an eater to not want to eat, especially when the menu didn't say that it came with all of that stuff. Fortunately, our server was understanding, took it back, allowed me to select something else from the menu (that still lacked an explanation of its ingredients, but he was able to provide them verbally so that I could be sure of what I was getting this time) and didn't charge me for the taquitos.  I think it's critical that the menu spell out what ingredients are in the item - not only does this usually help you sell the item and keep picky eaters like myself happy, but it also helps those with food allergies avoid certain items without having to pester their server with those types of things.  Considering the menu issue, I'd reduce them to 3 stars, but they recover to 4 on the customer service end on immediately rectifying the issue for me. I just hope they put a more long-term solution in place by rewriting the menu to be more verbose.",

The server apologized and got her the cheese enchiladas and we told her to please take the enchiladas off the bill and if she had an issue with that we would be happy to talk to her manager. The manager, Israel, comes over to our table and asks if my friend specified if she was vegetarian. She said no. He then proceeded to lecture her that it was her fault that she didn't say she was vegetarian and that if she had then they wouldn't have served her the chicken enchiladas... even though she ordered the cheese enchiladas BECAUSE SHE'S A VEGETARIAN. This manager was the rudest person I have ever met and would not stop arguing with her about it to the point she was almost in tears.

We've been to the Javier's in Irvine, and the Las Vegas location was just as good, if not better. The ambience is dark, cool, and transports you.   Advice: MAKE A RESERVATION. We thankfully had a 6pm reservation for Saturday night. Otherwise, it would've been a 90 minute wait. Yikes.  My husband got the Carnitas and got the Carnitas soft tacos combo plate. Wow. Some of the best, if not the best, carnitas we've ever had. Also, the chips and salsa were on point. The chips were salted and thin and the salsa has a little kick to it. The food was excellent and the service was great. People were constantly coming around to refill our waters, ask if we needed anything, etc.  The only kinda weird thing about this place was the restroom. They had an attendant in there, selling a bunch of little stuff like gum, perfume, lotion, whatever. You couldn't even use soap without her pumping some into your hand. I think that sort of thing is *really* tacky so that was kind of letdown.   Small disappointment: there was no recognition of my husband's birthday. Was kinda hoping for a small dessert or something, but it went unacknowledged. Oh well.  Other than that, we would absolutely come back to Javier's in the future!",

    "text": "1 star for the Spicy margarita mixed with tamarind 1 star for our server and... 1 star for chips & salsa  Listen, I KNOW everything at Aria is overpriced...but this food was just not worth it. I order the Cabo Azul, (maine lobster enchilada in a creamy pasilla sauce, a grilled chile relleno stuffed with Jack cheese, shrimp and Dungeness crab, topped with relleno sauce, and an Ensenada style shrimp taco on a flour tortilla). I did not want the taco, so I substituted it for a cheese enchilada. Maybe I went on a bad day, but for $43 you shouldn't have any bad days. The green sauce was so bitter and the chile relleno did not have the egg coating outside like the real thing. Flavors overall were just not there.   We had the Totopos de Mariscos for an appetizers and I was not impressed at all. Just chips, with some melted cheese, crab, finished off with green onion and black olives.  Margaritas were good, I did a spicy margarita with half tamarind.  Our server who's name I forgot was great, we sat at a table by the bar as we did not want to wait an hour for a booth.   Would I recommend this place, probably not. But I wouldn't mind coming back for drinks and chips and salsa.",

    "text": "I had a disappointing experience last night. First, when I made my reservation I asked if they do something special for birthdays, they told me yes and asked if my friend was a man or woman...so they would know whose birthday it was.   We were seated right away. The waiter was not attentive and we had to ask him for things multiple times. Getting water refilled and a box was a long process because he kept disappearing or just wouldn't bring what he asked for.   As for the food, it wasn't bad but it wasn't great either. My chicken quesadilla was $26 and didn't have much flavor. My friend found bones in his chicken. The staff didn't seem to care so maybe this is normal?   At the end of the meal, the waiter brought our check...no birthday dessert. I couldn't mention it in front of my friend because the whole thing is to be a secret. I planned ahead and attached it to my reservation so I wouldn't have to sneak to the front during dinner to mention it. Overall, this was a disappointing birthday dinner for my friend. As a Vegas local, I'm always looking for new restaurants and sadly I won't be returning to this one.",

Lots of symbolism, for sure. The Tequila \"trees\" are a nice touch.  My group and I came in on the Fourth of July for a late lunch / early dinner, and we were seated right away. There's complimentary chips and salsa to start, which is always a good way to start a meal at a Mexican restaurant.  Expect the menu to be a bit pricey -- especially since this is Vegas and Javier's is in Aria -- but the portions aren't bad. I wasn't too hungry, so I got the Ceviche de Ahi -- basically, tuna poke. I wish I would have tried the Octopus Ceviche instead, but there's always next time. My friends opted for the combination plates. I believe it was the Enchilada, Chile Relleno and Taco. It was a whole lot of food, but we were hungry and finished everything right there and then.  The food was so filling and flavorful, we joked that we needed to come back ASAP. Definitely a great choice.",

In fact, if I reviewed them without rose colored glasses, they'd definitely still earn a 4-4.5 with my only serious critique being the VERY loud music. Taylor's original plan was proposing at the end of dinner, but he \"called an audible\" and changed plans because the volume was not remotely suitable for popping the question.  The restaurant is beautiful. The bar is surrounded by an impressive rope installation and there are interesting displays throughout the dining room. The menu is definitely seafood focused, but there's enough options for the land lovers too. The enchilada trio was divine! Stuffed with plenty of meat and bathed in the most delicious green sauces I've ever had! I would probably just do the two lobster enchiladas next time, but this was the perfect way to try all of their specialties. Their house salsa is also really tasty, but on the spicer side; be advised if you're not keen on heat and perhaps they have a milder option if asked??   This place gets pretty busy (walk up wait times were over an hour the Saturday evening we went) and reservations also fill up well in advance, so give them a call directly a couple weeks beforehand to save your table!",

We ordered taquerias to start (just ok)... for entrees we chose the Dungeness crab enchiladas along with the most gargantuan scallops I've ever seen! My scallops were so enormous I wasn't even able to finish my whole dish! I was wanting a little extra kick so our server was so kind as to bring me some of their homemade habanero sauce. He told me to take great caution as the hot sauce was \"extremely spicy\"... man he wasn't kidding!!! Thank god I mixed it in with a little sour cream because that was probably the spiciest sauce I'd ever tried... could've given me 3rd degree burns to my tongue if I didn't take him seriously!!!

For the main I got the steak tacos which were so good. The steak was to die for, you could taste the charcoal it was cooked over, yum!!

My husband and I came here for lunch and we each ordered enchiladas and got a side of guacamole. He also ordered a beer. Our lunch was $100. Absurd right?   Even worse was that I requested my sauce to be on the sauce and it came smothered all over my enchiladas then my husband got an entirely different dish than he ordered. Our waitress didn't check on us much she was more concerned with the table of gentlemen ordering beers next to us and chatting it up with other bartenders.  The water boy wouldn't even crack a smile or say hi. It was the most rudest/awkward thing. I would have refilled my own water if I could.   Their guacamole is out of this world delicious and another plus of this place is that they offer complimentary chips and salsa. The food was very delicious but for $100 lunch was a little steep. We had food and beverage credit by staying at aria which is where this is conveniently located. I doubt we come back again just due to the lack of service we got here. Other places you can visit nearby that you get treated much better for a much cheaper price point.",

If you are looking to dine comfortably or with a larger party, it is absolutely necessary to make a reservation before hand. There will still be a wait even with a reservation.   The chips and salsa are very tasty and their fajitas are even tastier. Servers are very friendly although they are always rushing through everything.    The lounge area is where we sat. You can order main dishes there as well, it is just a less formal seating arrangement. It's more of a hang out, quick dinner/snack area before you go out to a club.   I go to Javier's in Newport Beach/Century City many many times and would recommend any location because the food is perfectly cooked!",

It's in the heart of Aria and worth getting there no better matter what hotel you're in.  The bar area is fantastic and the whole vibe is fantastic.  Shocker, I'll be going back on my next trip. :)",

This was my 2nd time coming here in the last 4 days and my mind was just blown, again, by these damn enchiladas! The seafood one is for sure my favorite but the chicken with brown mole is great in a completely different way. Today I ordered 1 seafood + 1 chicken but with the green tomatillo sauce instead and it was so freakin good! Every bite I was shakin my head in awe of everything going on in my mouth. Hands down my favorite Mexican spot of all time. COME HERE NOW!",

Dined at Javiers last night just before the Janet Jackson concert at the PARK MGM-   We shared their famous \" Tabla\" a wooden, simple tray loaded with choice of carnitas, chicken and/steak. We chose their carnitas and carne asada-   Carnitas were on point!!!!!!! We devoured them- carne asada was a bit dry, but we still ate it-   So this \" Tabla\" comes with Mexican rice, refried beans, fresh guacamole, pickled jalapenos, pico de gallo, queso fresco and choice of tortillas. Cost is $70, but fed us both and filled our tummies.   Service at Javiers- is second to none- so attentive and quick to serve you more water or anything you desire-   Supper impressed!!!!  We were in and out in time for the concert-   If you have never been in this establishment, it is absolutely gorgeous!!! Like a hidden cave, dark, classy Mexican Restaurant-   A must, must try if you come to Vegas-",

We both ordered the beef enchilada and chicken taco combo and were very impressed.  Food was hot and flavourful.  As amazing as everything was, we were most happy with the chips and salsa that were brought to our table when we sat down.  The salsa was absolutely to die for.  We couldn't stop eating it.  One thing that was super weird - there's a full length mirror on the inside of the stall door in the women's washroom.  Full length.  So when you sit down - you're just staring at yourself.  Anyway.. that was very strange but everything else was great! haha",

We did not have a reservation and had about a 30 minute wait.   Service: A++ After being seated we were promptly greeted by a server who provided water and offered drinks. The water was respectful of our conversation we were really chatty which caused a delay in ordering. My friend drinks water like a fish and they have 6oz water glasses I was impressed I never saw the bottom of her glass.  Server recommended food appropriately when we asked.   Food: Presentation spot on! Beautiful dishes. The beans and rice were amazing with flavor, nothing was bland. I ordered an enchilada and taco both were good and as expected. Serving size is kind of small compared to most Competitive Mexican Restaurants but I was satisfied.   Ambiance: perfect. Very modern. Lower light. Decor throughout",

We went in to celebrate my 40th birthday with 3 other couples. This was on a Sunday late night, so the restaurant was very slow. We had drinks, appetizers and out main meals. We were having a great time. The waiter was subpar with his service. We had to ask a lot for refills etc. We informed the waiter that it would be separated checks  and he said they can make it work.  He presents us with one bill and asked us to figure it out. Would not assist us with separate checks. This is a supposed 4 upscale restaurant in the Aria casino and they were treating us like we were high schoolers going to Denny's. No corporation or assisting us with the transaction. We were all ready to pay our bills but they will not break it down for us. We sat for over a half hour trying to figure out our portions then they told us they would only take one form of payment. It was awe full. I asked to speak with management abd they got very defensive. Ask to speak to casino host they would not guide us. Now it is 1:00 am and we are tired and still no assistance. Finally they allowed separate credit card payments but when they got to my husband we paid our bill and informed us that there was still over $40 owed on the bill. We have no idea who that balance that belonged to but when it was said and done we were stuck with the unpaid balance. We were there to celebrate my birthday and they made it a horrible experience. They were rude, condescending, they made me feel horrible and humiliated me with there disrespect. Word to the wise. They are very unprofessional unlike the Javier's in Newport Beach. Be ready to be pay what you did not eat.",

Took forever to get drink menus, the waiter was a scatter brain, and it looked like this was happening at every table. We ordered a lot of different drinks, it took forever to get them and they were HORRIBLE. They all tasted like water, no alcohol at all. When you are paying 17 for a martini, they better put some alcohol in it. The guacamole was good but they put a huge piece of Romaine Lettuce in it so it takes up half of the bowl. Totally not worth it and definitely not for more than 2 people. 2 people at our table ordered the same item for dinner and they both came out missing an item. Are you kidding me?? They didn't bring the items back to the table until we were finished eating. We were here for a birthday and they never brought out the birthday dessert. By the time we got home, I had food poisoning like you can not even imagine!! Thanks Javier's! Still feel sick, hoping this will go away soon. Save your money and eat at Taco Bell. It will be a much better experience.",

Our server Ciara was so sweet and took care of us with no delay. My drink was absolutely perfect!!! Pricey but perfect! We ordered the costillar de Rez.  OMG it was so amazing. The meat melts in your mouth! Overall this place offers gourmet Mexican food.  It is on the pricey side but to me it's worth it!",

    "text": "Ok so this place you have to make reservations in advance because is hard to get in specially if you make them last minute. forget trying to walk in they won't take you . Anyways I'm only giving it two stars because the manager changed our seats after we were seated at a table like Cheesecake Factory and you are basically on top of other people .she was very nice to me and my husband but other than that I would give it zero stars. Let  me start by saying the customer service here sucks and is out  the door . We arrived and basically they made us wait and after the hostess tried to seat us down at a table where it was pretty much you are eating with your neighbors. When we complaint about it and ask for her to change us she said that's all they had with an attitude and a poker face . She said we can go seat by the bar that's when I asked her to get the manager and you can read on the top of this review she was very nice and accommodating. Once we were seated at the new table the waiter was a disaster who took forever to get our order and to bring out the food mind you he didn't even checked on us to tell us anything . I ordered the beef tacos but when they came out it was steak beef not ground beef which was basically raw and he didn't say anything before I ordered that it was steak beef not ground beef . The food isn't that great and they act like is high end and is not . Save your self the trip Tijuana flats is cheaper and better . I will not be coming back .",

That being said, the ambience is much nicer. But its pretty, loud, dark, and I felt like our waiter was rushing us. I got the soft tacos, one steak, one chicken. They were nothing special but I like that they came with guac. You get comp chips and salsa which are also standard except the salsa was a little runnier than I like.",

    "text": "Javier's has spoiled me for any other Mexican restaurant, period. Another delicious meal yesterday... my mom and I went for lunch, the last meal of our 3-day trip in Vegas. I started with a jalapeno margarita (of course!) and we shared the lime infused shrimp ceviche. The chips are so thin and crispy, and the gorgeously red salsa has just the right amount of \"kick.\" She had the shredded chicken tacos with beans and rice, and I had the chopped salad with champagne vinaigrette. Everything was wonderful, as I have come to expect from Javier's! Eduardo, our server, and Ivan, our busser, took great care of us and were totally awesome. The only drawback is the cost: $90 including tip. It's definitely up there, but bottom line is that you are paying for quality. Sure, you can go somewhere cheaper but the food will probably also taste like slop. This is a splurge type of place and you just have to enjoy the experience, knowing it may be awhile until your next visit... ahhhh.",

My friends and I like to start our weekend off by coming in here on Friday night. The restaurant is beautiful, the menu is great and the drinks are good.  The ambiance is dark with metal and wood carvings and ropes. They play cool music and the food is delicious. They have traditional Mexican Fare. The service is fast and efficient.  If you are a fried ice cream fan, theirs is delicious. A unique twist is the addition of salted peanuts to the crispy outer coating which lends a nutty savory bite against the cold creamy ice cream. It is served in a fried tortilla shell coated in cinnamon and sugar and able to be enjoyed with each bite.",

The taquitos and the seafood enchiladas are delicious. I wish they had consome for their taquitos. Consome is the a broth, trust me the taquitos will taste better if you can dip them in a little hot broth. I am Mexican and don't like to eat at Mexican restaurants because it's never the same but this place is pretty good. Obviously not the same but one thing you guys need to know is that Mexican food is different depending on the state of Mexico. I am from Sinaloa :)",

    "text": "I will echo what many of the other reviewers have said- Javier's is a very solid dining experience. The dark, sultry decor is very inviting and makes a striking initial impression. Seating is a little tighter than I'd prefer, but it was not a major issue (except when the couple next to us overheard some of our conversation and were a bit appalled!)  They've got an interesting mix of music playing (lots of hip hop) At first, I couldn't tell if it was from the casino, but I am pretty sure it was actually from the restaurant. I didn't mind at all, but it was a bit unexpected in a Mexican restaurant.   The service was fantastic. Our waiter was quite knowledgable about almost everything on the menu, and able to give complete recommendations. He really gushed over how good everything was- and was quite believable! Our water and drinks were replenished frequently, the table side pour of my friend's beer was done with a flourish, and we were checked on periodically without feeling stifled or rushed.  The food was also quite good. I didn't consider the prices exceedingly high, especially for a relatively upscale restaurant on the Strip. Most entrees appeared to range from between $20-$45, although there were some more expensive items as well.   The chips and salsa were fresh and delicious, as was the guacamole. My strawberry margarita was  also very tasty. It wasn't overly sweet or syrupy, but yet remained flavorful and easy to drink.    I ordered the quesadilla marisco ($28), and my dining companion ordered the Cabo Azul ($30). They both were great meals, with generous portions. The quesadilla was everything it should be- cheesy and full of seafood. It was served with sour cream and guacamole on the side. The Cabo Azul was indeed a big meal, and well worth the price. It included a shrimp taco, lobster enchilada, beans and rice, and stuffed peppers. I was able to sample the shrimp taco and the enchilada, and thought they were both delicious.   I'd definitely consider Javier's again for upscale Mexican in a sexy atmosphere. Muy bien!",

They offer water of course I needed water and probably a Pedialyte but water and modelos were fine. chips and salsa were absolutely amazing and I'm not a fan of red salsa but damn .. I ordered a chicken enchilada with a shredded beef taco plate once again that was amazing my hubby had a chili something I don't remember but he did enjoy his food as he inhaled it.  Now the woman restroom! I could no believe all the supplies they had in there made my bathroom at home feel empty! But make sure you take a tip   Totally recommend this place I will be back in 4 months",

I ordered the Ahi tuna Ceviche as our appetizer but I eat this all the time at poke restaurants and the taste was just Ok, so my recommendation is to stay with normal Mexican ceviche. Now the main coarse for me was the Cabo Azul, enjoyed everything about it,  delicious chile relleno, shrimp taco, and enchilada. All well made. Also ordered the Jalapeno Margarita and it was OK, had better at BJs. Will definitely give this place another visit when I come back to Sin City",

I looked on their website and did not see an option to make a reservation online. They aren't on Open Table either so I called the restaurant to make a reservation since I was trying to squeeze dinner here in between an event and a show I had bought tickets for and knew I would be short on time.  When I got there they didn't have my reservation. It looked like the girl at the front counter was looking at a piece of paper with names printed on it and my name wasn't on her list. I was so bummed, I really wanted to try this place out and called weeks in advance to book a table a the time that I wanted. There was over an hour wait when I got there. Luckily, after explaining the situation to a manager they were able to get me a table after a short wait but this would not have been necessary if they had a more modernized system.  As for the food, it was all delicious. The lobster was one of the best I have ever had anywhere! But minus one star for the reservation snafu.",

It's generally not my favorite type of food and it's hard to find a authentic Mexican place in Warsaw (where I live), so to this very day I did not know that their food can taste so awesome!  I don't really understand why all restaurants in Vegas hotels are so dark - you can barely see the menu. But I guess they like it like that. The decor puts you in a good mood, they have very comfortable sofas and play great music. The waiters are really nice and professional. One time my fiance and I stayed a few minutes past the closing time to finish our drinks and we didn't feel rushed at all. I tried a few things from the menu and all of them were really good: the steak, the enchiladas, the quesadilla. We also had a superb fun creating our own tacos from the plate of ingredients (La Tablita)! And the margaritas there are great. I loved the mango one on the rocks.   To sum up, great place, tasty food, delicious drinks and friendly atmosphere. I would gladly visit again.",

    "text": "One word to describe the restaurant: sexy!  With super cool decor and some nice mood lighting, that is the first word that comes to my mind when I think of this restaurant.  On both of my visits I was lucky to be seated in a comfy, spacious booth in the back overlooking the whole place and was able to take in the ambiance.  That spot was great for people-watching!  They serve complimentary chips and salsa which taste amazing!  We totally could not stop eating them, even after our entrees came.  The salsa was tasty and the chips so crispy and not too greasy.  Yum!!  So good that we ended up coming back the next night as well!  Sorry, Chevys.  I now have a new favorite place for chips and salsa!     As for my entrees, the first night I got the combination plate with one cheese enchilada and one crispy chicken taco.  Rice and refried beans came with my meal as well.  I enjoyed the taco but I've had better enchiladas elsewhere, so the next night I ended up getting the taco dinner (crispy chicken tacos again).  To drink that night I ordered a virgin strawberry margarita, which was pricey at $10 but really good.   Other items we tried: their guacamole and fried ice cream.  Their guac was fine though not as tasty as their salsa and not quite up there with Dos Caminos guac.  Their ice cream was ok as well.  I think we just got some to be able to hang out there a little bit longer :p  This place is so much busier than the restaurant that was here before, and with good reason.  Great atmosphere, tacos, virgin margaritas, and chips and salsa = one of my new favorite restaurants in Las Vegas!",

Unfortunately our recent experience was horrible. 3 people in our party of 5 got food poisoning, all of which had shrimp in their dish. To add insult to injury, I have called 2 times to report the incident. Each time I called and talked with a manager they took my contact information and said they would call back but I have to ever received a call. Although it did ruin the remainder of our trip, my main concern is that they are aware and take corrective action. I would like to feel good about eating there in the future.

My wife and I were kindly seated in one of the cool booths which gave us a great view of those amazing wood carvings of the dead.  I'd love to know how much they actually cost.    We were in a rush to catch Zarkana so we didn't dilly dally with any appetizers but the salsa that came with the chips was muy delicioso.  My wife ordered the \"Cabo Azul\" which was basically a seafood combo.  The most eyecatching thing in the combo was the lobster enchilada but it turned out to be just OK.  The grilled chile relleno which was really big and stuffed with cheese, shrimp, crab and topped with tomatillo sauce was mouthfuls of awesomeness.  They actually served the shrimp taco on a separate plate and that was very good too.    I ordered the carnitas based on the waiter recommendation.  I didn't know what to expect since the priciest carnitas I'd ever had before this was $12.  But I was pleasantly surprised when he brought it over.  The plate featured 3 parts of the pig including ribs, tenderloin and shoulder.  SOO good!  The waiter informed me that the pork is marinated for 24 hours, deep fried and then finished in an oven.  If KFC started frying pork, it would kind of taste like this.  The was crispy, tender and juicy all at once.  I would order this again in a heartbeat.    This was a very enjoyable meal overall.  We both wished we could have stayed longer.  The atmosphere, food preparation, service and strong drinks will ensure our return.",

Coming from LA, this place is very pricey for Mexican food, but you are paying for the ambiance of this place. I really like the ornamentation of this place with large ropes that adorn the ceiling and perimeter surrounding the bar area. We even witnessed a couple getting \"friendly\" at one of the booths.  We decided to sit at the bar to have some good conversation. The employees here were really friendly. FYI, the chairs at the bar are extremely heavy. Anyhow, we were given some chips and salsa to start. We ordered this seafood ceviche as an appetizer which was decent although the lemon was overpowering. Then, we ordered some drinks and some tacos. At least the tacos were a reasonable size for the amount that you are paying for them.   Of course after a few drinks, I needed to use the restroom. There is an attendant in the restroom which I suppose in a high end restaurant is expected, although weirded me out initially.  I would say that this place would be great to bring a date as it is a great backdrop for a romantic evening.",

Guac was fresh but badly needed a squeeze of lime.  Beef tacos were not good  with soggy, chewy shells and rather squeaky meat - 3/10.  Beef fajitas were very good and had charred green onions and nice grilled tomato chunks with very thin raja pepper strips and minimal veg - 8/10.  Chicken fajitas were good but the meat was somewhat dry -7/10.  Lobster enchiladas with tomatillo  sauce were delish per the two ladies in group that ate them.  Flan we had for dessert was yummy, and nicely firm with great caramel sauce - 8/10.  Service was pretty good although they forgot one side dish we ordered.",

Great atmosphere, very busy & good music too.  Immediately had chips (yes, they are THE best) & salsa & our drink order taken: Cucumber, Tamarindo, Jalapeno Margaritas. All delicious, I tried them all. With a very generous amount of tequila in each one.   We shared: Ceviche de pescado, Carnitas, Cabo Azul & Carne Tampiquena. Plenty of food for the 4 of us, plus a little left over.   Everything tasted fresh & absolutely delicious. I also noticed that nothing was greasy & prepared with only the finest ingredients.  For dessert we had 1 of each of the offered desserts: fried ice cream & FLAN. I am a HUGE fan of Flan and order it every chance I get, but sometimes I'm disappointed. Not at Javier's, it was THE BEST FLAN I've ever had: not too sweet & the consistency was perfect!  Chris was one of our waiters, made us feel at home. The hospitality & service was out of this world AMAZING!  So if you're looking for a $6 burrito this is NOT the place for you. If you are looking for FINE MEXICAN Food that will be worth every penny, JAVIER'S is it!  Can't wait to visit Las Vegas again, Javier's will definitely be at the top of our dining list.",

    "text": "We came for a Friday evening dinner. Reservations were booked through our concierge at Aria. When we arrived, the restaurant for whatever reason did not have our reservation. Although the restaurant was clearly packed, the hostesses got us a table within 5 minutes. The food was delicious but even more importantly, I insist you try the cucumber margarita. I had one sip and ordered them to keep on coming. The only reason for the 4 stars is that at one point we didn't see our waitress for a solid 25-30 minutes and were sitting dry and waiting. Also, the guacamole is mediocre at best. And considering they expect $10 for a small bowl of it, it better be the best I've ever tried. Don't waste your money on it, it's disappointing!  Other than that, good place all around if you don't mind crowds.  It is BUSY!",

    "text": "I'm not ashamed to admit I've eaten my fair share of Mexican-American food. While Javier's claims to be authentic Mexican, they still serve free chips and salsa with every meal. Do not let that throw you off. First off, the salsa is MIND BLOWING. Secondly, the restaurant is still fairly classy. I came here with my boy and my parents (yes... my parents). We had a reservation and were promptly seated in a large booth near the bar.  Our waitress was a tad moody, but she gets points for knowing every detail about the entire menu.    All of our margaritas were AMAZING. I had 2 of the jalapeno margaritas and the four of us split the queso fundido as an app. It was a bit like melted mozzarella on a plate (in a good way) and was served with warm flour tortillas for dipping. I was already fairly full, so I ordered the ceviche de camaron. It was tasty, but nothing spectacular. However, the portion was much larger than expected. A lot of the other yelpers complained about the noise level. It was loud and sort of clubby, but that's part of the experience. Javier's is smack dab in the middle of Aria's casino floor... what did you expect?",

Very different vibe than the other location, but I love them both!! This one is in the middle of a casino floor so you'd expect it to not feel as intimate as it does, but I was pleasantly surprised! I supposed table location is important? The service is STELLAR! Food is delicious (I had the vegetable enchiladas) and the music was excellent (not sure if it was coming from the restaurant or the nearby casino floor?) I loved the fact that they had a large private dining room if you wanted to have a (semi) private party. The prices are a bit steep ($20+ for a salad??) but hey, you are in Vegas right  = )",

After taking a few bites, I noticed it was barely lukewarm and that there was no spinach in the enchiladas.  I flagged him down again to ask him if he brought me the spinach enchiladas, and it turned out he brought me the wrong ones.  He offered to have the cook prepare the correct ones, but  I didn't have time to wait, so I told him I'd eat what he brought.  It was bland and way overpriced.",

We started off with their house margaritas, which are made with el Jimador tequila. Pretty good, but they also have a great selection of others to choose from. We ordered a side of the guacamole to go with our chips and salsa which was so fresh and made perfectly. We both ordered the carne fajitas and they were delicious! We've been to the Newport and Irvine location, but our visit at the Vegas location has been, by far, our favorite of the 3. The food at Javiers at all locations have consistently been amazing, but what exceeded our expectations at the Vegas location was the service and the interaction with management. Our server, Ovidio, provided exceptional service. The manager, Charles, also spoke to our table and found out we were in town celebrating my birthday and made sure to send a dessert to our table. Little gestures like that go a long way and leave a lasting impression. We go to Vegas about 1-2 times a year, and are coming back in April. We definitely want to re- visit Javiers and hope that Ovidio and Charles will be there!",

Upon, arrival we were seated promptly and our server arrived at our table within a few minutes to take our drink order; however, the pleasantries ended shortly thereafter.  After waiting over 45 minutes for our dinner entrees and unable to locate our waiter, we approached the  manager, who was extremely rude to ask if there was a problem with our order.  After a few minutes she located our server, he stated that our food was almost ready and would be at the table within five minutes, but we still did not get our food until approximately 40 minutes later.  The food itself was good, although some of the items were cold.  When we received our bill, it stated we were a party of eight so they added an 18% gratuity to the bill when we were actually a party of seven.   I believe strongly in giving a good tip when it is warranted, but due to the inadequate service provided by our waiter, it should have been our option to decide what amount to give to him.  The manager at Javier's should also improve her attitude and be more courteous to the customers.  Her impolite and discourteous behavior is as poor example of how to conduct one's self in a cusdtomer-seviced based industry.",

We were sat in a large booth that made it seem very intimate which is nice because Vegas can be a little overwhelming so it's nice to have some quiet time. Also, I didn't mind the prices. It was actually cheaper than a lunch we had at the Wynn. However, it's still expensive in terms of Vegas, I just thought it was a slightly better deal and definitely more worth it.  Wish I had room for dessert. Don't miss this spot if you go to Vegas!",

    "text": "We were big fans of this restaurant and made it a point to return there when we were back in Las Vegas.  The food is good but the service made our overall experience extremely negative.  We requested the La Tablita, but were brought the frajitas.  Instead of just correcting the mistake, our waiter brought out the additional items that were not included in the frajitas entree and then had the nerve to up charge us MORE than the original Tablitia order that we didn't receive. We brought it to our waiter's attention and he said he would ask his manager to deduct the incorrect amount...which by the way was only $15.00...so it clearly was not about the money.   The manager, Julie came over and instead of just apologizing for the mistake and deducting the overcharge....problem resolved....she stood at our table for ten minutes and went through our bill line by line (we had drinks, appetizers, main courses..). She actually asked us to count how many shrimps we had on our plate to make sure she wasn't deducting an extra $5.00 from our $150 bill.   She reviewed the bill again and then said she will take off the incorrect overcharge and walked away.  She came back fifteen minutes later and wanted to go over the bill line by line AGAIN and we told her we were not spending another ten minutes with her at our table reviewing our bill.  We understand that mistakes occur, but Julie's attitude and extremely poor customer service completely ruined our meal.  Her complete lack of management ability to resolve a minor conflict resulted in Javier's losing us as loyal customers and our future recommendations. My recommendation....check your bill.",

The salsa is fresh, you can taste every ingredient while being in perfect harmony with the others & boasting just the right amount of heat. Really- it's THAT good. Hubby and I ordered the \"Tablita\" (sp?) for two. It's a trio of meats. Carne Assad we both will order again, so flavorful, carnitas, very flavorful but a little dry & chicken that was nothing special. The meal arrives on a plank of wood accompanied with rice (just ok, ho-hum) beans (so good we had to ask the waiter why they were so good), guacamole (yummy & fresh) onions, peppers, carrots etc... The concept is you make your own tacos with the tortillas. Such a quality meal & a value for two people. Plenty for both of us. Hub ordered 3 margarita's. The house (solid), Jalapeno (his favorite & then the Cadillac (loved it but more enjoyed the flavors of the jalapeno. We're locals that heard this place is great-they're right! We'll be back soon!!",

So I thought based on the ambiance that we would get not only the royal treatment but the food would be phenomenal!  Well so sad to say it was not! So extremely disappointed in this place, the food took an hour and some to come out , while we waited all we had was chips and salsa and no one really asked us if we wanted any drinks that maybe would have blurred the wait time for our food, when we asked how long before we get our food we got attitude from our waiter, people in our party we're older and feel the server should have offered and appetizer vs chips and salsa for the wait he said it was due to it being 4th of July, I have been a chef and owned a restaurant thus know they should be prepared, I am sad that they used an excuse rather than sent an appetizer for us to pay our meal, we were all mostly drinking water minus 2 people and we were a party of 12, the manager did Comp a lot of our meal because not only did we wIt along time for our food but it was cold when it finally came,  I ordered tacos and they were way over cooked not edible so dissipated my first time there and probably my last, so sad because the place looks incredible but definable fell short. Two stars was because the manager did his best to resolve the situation but he had only been informed a few minutes before I summoned him to our table, so sad about this",

I had Carne Asada while my wife had a trio of seafood enchiladas. I would definitely recommend both to anyone.   Having said this, The icing on the cake for me was the gentleman's restroom attendant. I cannot remember his name; however, he noticeably took pride in what he did. He provided a service that I believe is under appreciated. Soap in my hand, turning the water on for me, and having a towel ready to dry my hands. I know it sounds weird, but it made the experience that much better. My wife and I go to Vegas to \"treat ourselves\" to the luxuries we don't experience in our everyday lives raising three kids. This restaurant gave us that experience.

My mango margarita was the only redeeming grace.  If I had to find one positive, we didn't get sick from the food so I guess that's a win? But the food tasted more like cafeteria slop rather then what we recall from last year.  It's odd and I can't figure it out. Change of chef?

On this trip we had the La Tablita which is a build-your-own soft taco extravaganza for two people!  At first the price of $50 seems shocking, but you get more food than if you each were to order soft tacos on your own.  Plus they will bring out more soft tacos shells when you need them at no additional charge!  We were able to build 12 soft tacos out of all of the meat (chicken, pork and steak) and sauteed vegetables that came with the meal.  This is truly an awesome experience.  Arrive early to get in!",

    "text": "Absolutely love this place. Endless chips and salsa, great drinks, great atmosphere, and overall good Mexican food. I had the Enchiladas Suizas with the tomatillo sauce. The tomatillo sauce is nice and light, which is the way I like it so it doesn't overpower the taste of the meat and tortillas underneath it. The sour cream adds an additional creaminess that I really enjoyed.   The service is top notch just like most other places in the LV strip. The bartenders seemed to be well trained and were very attentive. The servers were always around making sure we were doing ok. I would definitely recommend stopping by for dinner a few drinks before hitting the strip for a night out.",

I don't even care about the wait times or slow service. I don't mind paying a slightly higher premium for AMAZING food. I ordered the Cabo Azul, which is a lobster enchilada, a crab stuffed chile relleno, shrimp taco, rice and beans. My best friend got the enchilada and taco combo. We split a side of guacamole and the chips and salsa.....We were found literally scraping our plates. EVERYTHING WAS AMAZING. Oh and I had the El Silencio Martini, AMAZING. Thank GOD we have you here in California. If we did not, Javier's would be a must-go stop, EVERYTIME we hit Vegas. GO HERE!!!!!!! NOW!!!!!",

I would bet on $50-70/person if you do a full meal with an appetizer, main course, and a drink. I started with a house margarita and it was only $12 which is an amazing deal in Vegas AND it was delicious and strong too. Then I got the queso fundido with chorizo which was savory and spicy. The queso, unlike most, did not solidify immediately and was good for about 15 minutes. Then I got the steak fajitas which was large enough for two people. The beans are made with lard which makes them a little heavier but the taste was fantastic. I used my left over chips and used the beans for a dip, which lightened them up a little bit. Also I was able to get all of that service and food within one hour of sitting down, which is rare if you are in Vegas. Overall- I'm going to make it a priority to bring my husband here next time we come to Vegas!",

But to be honest, I've had better tacos on a street taco stand.   The thing that really brought this place down to a 2 star restaurant, however, was the service. I asked when the waiter came around if I could had my water refilled. Shouldn't even have to asked, but all right. He heard me and said yes, then disappeared. Then he was helping out other tables. Eventually I asked again, and this time, the same thing. We were looking around and it didn't seem like they were understaffed, and in fact other tables got their water refilled and other needs tended to with no problem, albeit by different waiters. The service was just really horrible for no reason.",

    "text": "The chips and salsa here are excellent. Some people might like the setting. It is in the Aria Casino and you feel like you are having dinner in a loud nightclub. If you like a party atmosphere, you might like this place. If you want to be able to talk to your dinner mates like I do, then this is not the place for you. We noticed the loud factor right away but had reservations and were with another couple so rather than trying to find another place - we decided to grin and bear it thinking that the food will make up for the loud factor.  If we would have been by ourselves, we would have left.  However, we were with a couple and hungry for Mexican food.  Oh, I did ask if the music could be turned down and was told \"No.\" We both ordered the carnitas and were very disappointed. You don't get a choice of black beans or refried beans - but okay let that go.  The carnitas was three pieces of dry pork and a bone.  It wasn't the wonderful savory shredded carnitas that you can put in a tortilla and load up with other goodies.  Our friends seemed to enjoy their taquitos and their cheesy quesadilla and didn't mention the noise factor.  Advice:  stick to drinks, chips, snacks and a party atmosphere.  Don't try to have a savory, enjoyable meal with friends and good conversation.  And try something other than the carnitas.",

Perhaps like some others have said I'm spoiled with Mexican food back in California but it was simply okay. One person at our table ordered a $20 quesadilla which we assumed would be spectacular for $20... Nope. Just a quesadilla with a small amount of guac and sour cream on the side.  The worst part was the $18 margaritas. They basically tasted like sour mix and weren't large. I might as well have gone into the casino just out the door (remember it's a lounge as much as a restaurant) and gamble away my $18 and gotten a free house margarita with the 1% chance of winning something.  The service was good which was a bummer because I felt compelled to tip well since the expensive crappy food wasn't there fault. Oh the two stars are for the decent unlimited chips and salsa!!",

It was so good, we all had to stop eating them to not spoil our appetite for our entree!  And not to mention, the chips and salsa were never ending!  Very good!

Also no pitchers of margaritas here and  at $18 a pop for a Cadillac margarita  you couldn't even taste the alcohol. I have been a frequent customer since Javiers opened in California never had this terrible experience before! My advice is to save your money in Vegas or make a trip to California where they do it right!!!",

We sat down and if you have been to the Javier's in Newport its beautiful and the ambiance is amazing. The Vegas location lacked all that. My friend and I ordered the chicken tacos to share.  When the food arrived we noticed the tacos had guacamole on them. The menu didn't say that guacamole came on the tacos. My friend I was sharing with is allergic to avocado so we had to send them back. I asked for guacamole on the side since I wanted guacamole on my tacos. Another friend of mine was less than happy with her meal and didn't take more than 2 bits of her meal.  We asked to waitress to talk to the manager. The waitress was sweet but seemed new and didn't know much about the menu. The manager seemed afraid to come talk to us and didn't want to anything to help us with our issues. The manager, waitress and another man who looked like he may have been another manager stood at the computer for a good 15 minutes just staring and us and the computer. What's so hard about working with a customer who was not impressed with the restaurant at all. By this time we were pretty pissed off. A girlfriend of mine got up and went to talk to them one on one since she worked in the restaurant/nightlife industry. This is not rocket science. By the time we got the check they charged me for my side of guacamole which I was confused because guacamole supposedly came on the tacos. As we were about to leave a group of guys came over to us and offered to buy us drinks. We got the guys to buy us 2 bottles of Cristal spending well over $2,000 at the restaurant in 10 minutes. I hated to give them that kind of business but hey I guess they should have been thanking us and maybe treated us a little better earlier that night. Next time I'll take my business somewhere else and make them money.   I do recommend the Javier's in Newport",

It was not busy but we still waited too long to receive our drink order but the main problem for me was that after our server dropped of our meals, that was the last we saw of her until we asked for the check . No water was brought to the table after we asked nor did we get an offer for us buy another round of drinks. There were 3 of us dudes and we like to drink and here we are with empty glasses the whole time.",

    "text": "The server was great about accommodating my gluten free diet(I'm have celiac disease), and the chips & salsa were a delicious start. My husband ordered the beef taco & chicken enchilada combo, and per the server's recommendation I had the pescado del dia which was halibut with sauteed veggies and black beans. My husband was satisfied with his meal, because it tasted like El Cholo back in LA, which is our favorite mexican there. However, this was more pricey than El Cholo, and we expected more from Javier's.  My fish was overcooked, and under seasoned. Halibut should never taste fishy, but it did. My homemade black beans are way better seasoned, and the veggies were hardly sauteed. Supposedly they came with a light cream sauce but if it was there, it didn't add anything. My husband wanted to send it back but I was so hungry I just doused it in salsa and it was edible, but not worth anywhere near $40. I should've gone with the enchiladas despite the servers fish recommendation.  I wish I could recommend it because it was our first date night out just the 2 of us since we're here filming a movie and his parents are only in town for a couple days to babysit ;-( At least they didn't gluten poison me",

We left so satisfied that we were unable to order desert.  We were so impressed with our first visit that we decided to return specifically for dessert the next afternoon.  Unfortunately, the second time around, we were not even greeted by our server.  He never bothered to introduce himself (an older gentleman with thinning hair).  Perhaps he was disappointed by the fact that we were only ordering dessert.  Not only did he not introduce himself but he cut my husband off twice while speaking.  It's a shame, as we had such a pleasant experience the first time.  When we visit Vegas again, we will definitely visit Javier's simply because of the food and the wonderful treatment we received from Luis, our waiter, the first time.",

There are so many great restaurants in Vegas...so, I think there are better options if you're gonna throw down $100/person on a meal and drinks.

And to me it had no flavor all I could taste was the queso fresco on top.  I got the wrong enchiladas but ate them anyway because I hate to be that person to return food and also because I was starving. They were good for not liking green sauce but only able to eat 1 of the 2.  Beans and rice, I had 1 bite and didn't care for it.  Will be going back for desert and drinks and the tacos.",

If you are going to pour me a Prosecco because your sweet wines are non-existent, please leave me the little bottle I purchased. About 1/3 of what we paid for went back to the kitchen and maybe someone back there had a toast with it. Weird. The seafood trip of enchiladas needs help. The crab one was good, the shrimp and scallop one could have been anything, there was no taste. Our server we had that night needs retraining to be in the people industry.  For the prices, we would choose elsewhere. Just too many other choices in Vegas to settle on barely a 3 star experience.",

Tonight we dined in the main dining area adjacent to the dancing dead sculpture wall.  The food is always well prepared, the cuts of meat trimmed and aged properly and the ceviche appetizer was fresher and better than ever.  I need to return and try out the tomahawk pork chop... goals :) no pics this time.  The food speaks for itself.",

    "text": "On a recent trip to Vegas, we stopped in at Javier's about an hour and a half before closing. The restaurant was fairly full but not crazy busy. The hostess (who was very friendly and helpful) sat us right away in a large corner booth and answered some basic questions about the menu. David, our busser, was awesome. Always on top of everything, refilling our chips and salsa, making sure we had water, etc. and always had a huge smile on his face. Our food was incredible, probably some of the best Mexican food I've ever had/ I had the lobster enchiladas, my husband had grilled halibut with steamed veggies and both of us are still thinking about that food.  Our only problem the entire evening was our server and he was consistently a problem. He was unable to offer suggestions and alternatives to deal with my husband's food allergies until pressed several times for it. He brought us the sparkling water we ordered without bringing us glasses to drink it out of and we had to ask a passing manager to do it. He took forever to take our orders because we weren't ready when he asked us the first time (2 minutes after we sat down). We sat awkwardly with cleared plates for 20 minutes, after the restaurant had closed for the night and almost every patron was gone, given no opportunity to even consider dessert, while we waited and waited and waited for our bill. I will be happy to come back and, hopefully, they'll promote David to waiter so our service can be as amazing as our food.",

We did notice the music was a bit louder after 7:00pm not sure if that was just the night we were there. In case you are having a business meeting it will probably be hard to hear. It's perfect for a date night or a night out for dinner. I was absolutely delighted with the presentation and the flavors were all very yummy. I know they have a variety of Martinis and mixed drinks I wasn't brave enough to try any. I was being boring and had a glass of the Chalk Hill Pinot Noir with dinner. My friend ordered the Tomahawk pork chop and said it was delicious. I ordered the Camarones rancheros and those were delicious. We had the Halibut Ceviche and taquitos for appetizers and the tres leches and flan dessert. Everything was great the only thing I wouldn't order again was the flan and taquitos. The flan tastes too much like egg and the taquitos were a bit dry. Other than that a very pleasant experience!",

    "text": "Food 4.5! Nice dark ambiance for lovers. Fancy shmancy Mexican food. I ordered the trio that included Chile Relleno, enchilada (chicken) and soft beef taco (option hard shell).   To start, the chips were a tad bit salty and looked like it was fresh out of the bag. The house salsa was awesome with good heat and fresh tomatoes, herbs etc.  Chile Relleno is a must. The batter was very light, cheese soft and pepper was nicely grilled. The enchilada was typical with a good amount of chicken. The soft taco was very soft, and beef was nicely seasoned. Although it sounds like a mouthful, the portion size was perfect. They were half the size of what you'd get at a typical Mexican restaurant, but it was just enough.   The jalapeno margarita was really refreshing; a bit sweet and spicy. It creeps up on you, so drink lightly.   The restaurant is located in the Aria. It's accessible from the tram.   Overall, a nice restaurant. Our waitress was a bit talky with colleagues and other customers. She asked if we wanted dessert after handing over the bill.  The bus boy was efficient with refilling water.",

There's onion, corn, tomato, cheese inside the enchilada...and it makes a good combination. The sauce is green pasilla sauce, which is not spicy at all. The rice is white, but has flavor..and was a little mushy but not terrible.   Prices are a little higher, but the quality is better.",

I get that it's in the Aria but the prices reflect some of the more modern contemporary steakhouses on the strip.  Also confused that they play hip hop as their back ground music as it takes away from their ambiance.  Last thing, they don't have shrimp fajitas which was strange with all of their other shrimp & fish options.  Great place for an out of town date, but locals it's not worth the price or the parking.",

When I asked for a manager ( Moises) to share my experience with the camera crew leaning on our table and also hovering over us after a 280.00 tab he comes to the table assuming we we're asking for some comp off our bill. Hell no Moises, that ain't what we asked. We can pay for the tab, but when you come over assuming we're asking for a freebeeeee... It's insulting. When you tell us that you wish we had told you this earlier then you would have moved us, that's unacceptable since we had reservations, you sat us here before this photo Shoot even started.  Shame on you for ruining my experience on mother's day dinner!! As a manager you should have come to my table correct and not assumed anything and then making sure to tell us there is nothing you can do. #IWONTBEBACK.",

My husband ordered the steak and prawns which tasted phenomenal.  The reason for the two stars is the very poor service.   We had to ask twice for more salsa and we were not checked on after our food was delivered.  We then waited an extended amount of time for the bill.  Would not recommend.  For the price point I would expect much better service. Edited to add that aria sky suites management made this right by us.",

    "text": "Probably one of the more affordable restaurants in Aria. But with that said, you can expect to spend roughly $40-50 per person if you stick with a main entree and one alcoholic drink. With our $50 beverage and dining credit, I did some Yelpy research and figured that we could make like thieves and get away with an upscale dining experience for 2 for a grand total of $9.  At Javier's, the best meal to get is \"La Tablita\". You won't regret it. It can easily feed three adults, maybe even four. For $46, you get ample servings of rice, beans, rajas (roasted peppers), pico de gallo, guacamole, carnitas, chicken, steak, and tortillas. We knew we did good when we got lots of drooly stares as people passed us and got seated at their tables.   The carne asada steak was seriously the best steak I've had in my life thus far. Thin and smoky and juicy. The chips and salsa are also complimentary. They don't offer it straight up but ask for the \"green\" salsa (also complimentary). It's a tomatillo salsa - spicy and sour and sweet.  Dress nice or you'll stick out.",

The beef was amazing and the vegetables were cooked so good! What we also liked here was that the dishes that we ordered contained a little or no cheese so the food was not greasy, heavy, or unhealthy.  Expensive, but I would considered it as a top-level restaurant. Also, the service was very good: clean, attentive, and prompt. One reviewer said he or she was not impressed with the taste, and I am very surprised to see such a review. Perhaps, a person doesn't like the Mexican cuisine, but in my opinion it tasted amazing! Also, this place is reviewed as not kids friendly. We visited the restaurant with our 10-month baby and were given a cozy, quieter place which we enjoyed and had no complaints about. The restaurant warns at the front desk that there is no place to store strollers, so maybe this is the reason why it's considered as a not kids friendly place. Next time I am in Las Vegas, Javier's will be my first restaurant to visit.",

    "text": "I'm well versed with Javier's. I spent plenty of nights at the old Laguna Beach location, and when they relocated it to Newport Beach, we used to spend a fair amount of time there as well.  I'm familiar with their food and drinks, so I was expecting the same great menu here.  I was early to meet my party, so I decided to have a cocktail at the bar. I ordered the Jalepeno Margarita, which was excellent by the way. So my drink is $15, I give him a $20, he gives me a $5 bill back (he didn't break the $5 down). Ok, so my next drink is made by a female bartender. She gives me back $3. 78, right down to the pennies. She charged me tax on my drink. WTF? Tax is ALWAYS included. And who gives back dimes, nickles and pennies? Same drink, two different bartenders, two different prices. It was a little annoying.  Onto the meal. Same great food I've had before. I ordered the Seafood Enchiladas, nice pieces of lump crab meat and shrimp in every bite. Light sauce, not too heavy. The beans and rice that come with meal, beans were really good, not greasy at all. Chips & salsa were really good. Salsa is probably some of the freshest I've had.   Service, we were bombarded by three different people before and during our meal. It was too much. While we are still eating, he would come around and ask if we were done and if he could clear anything. Clearly we still have food on our plates, no we aren't done. I can't stand being rushed when I'm eating. If I want to talk during or after my meal, that's our business! Literally after seeing our plates empty, he came back around, starting clearing our plates and dropped our check off. Didn't offer coffee or dessert, he just made us feel rushed. Not cool.   Ambiance. I liked the feel, the dark wood, dim lighting, Dia De Los Muertos figurines, I also liked the lounge area near the bar as well. This wouldn't be a date spot like others have suggested, the music was really loud in here and it was a bit dificult to have a conversation with the person next to you.",

You get a lobster enchilada, shrimp and crab chile reno & lobster taco so great! My friend my 3 enchiladas 1 shrimp, crab and lobster she said it was beyond delicious.

Let me start with the decor and atmosphere. It's modern, yet sexy with a Mexican flare. The staff is friendly and the food is even better. My hubby and I go every time we are in town and have never had an issue here. I love to order taquitos with the Peruvian beans. Ahhmazing!  Yes, it's a little pricey but that's like any other restaurant in a casino on the Vegas strip. So worth the $. I suggest going here before watching a Cirque show. ;)",

I make better guac and I've only made it three times. Tastes like they scraped avocado out and mixed with the smallest amount of onion possible and nothing else. Needed lime, cilantro and salt. Horrible. People EXPECT good guac when they come to a nice Mexican restaurant. Asada tacos - tasteless. So disappointed. They have everything they need but aren't pulling it together. They know how to cook the steak well, but can't season it. DONT BE AFRAID OF SEASONING! Only saving grace is for 6 people it wasn't as expensive as I thought it would be. Also, all 5 other people at the table share these opinions. Totally fixable. Just have to try. Javier was a great server!",

    "text": "Avoid this place at all costs! The only thing \"upscale\" about this place is the decor and the prices.   The Food:  When you are in Vegas, it is understood that you pay a premium for good food; but the worst offense is when you pay a premium for bland and mediocre food. I visited this restaurant with 12 other people and we were all less than impressed with flavor and quality of the food. I got the the two shrimp tacos, with black beans and white rice for $22 and I am lucky if I even got a total of 6 shrimp between the two tiny tacos - but I don't know for sure since the shrimp were all chopped up. The black beans tasted like they were from a can and the white rice had ZERO flavor. I was extremely disappointed since the majority of the reviews rave about the food. I know that everyone has different likes and dislikes, but I have had better food at Taco Cabana.  The Service:  Let me preface this by saying that this place, is absolutely not a good place for groups to dine or celebrate special occasions. We went to Javier's to celebrate two of my friends' birthdays and we left in utter shock of the service we received. The dinner service was ok, nothing special, but I understand that there was a total of 13 of us and the restaurant was busy. The big shock came at the end of the evening when our server brought the check. We indicated to him that we wished to split the check 7 ways, at which point he stated that this is not something he could do. He stated that he was only allowed to split the check between 4 cards. Naturally, we were all annoyed at the situation. At no other point had this been brought to our attention; not when we made the reservation, not when we were seated, not when our orders were taken. We requested to speak with that manager hoping that we could get a better explanation as to why the checks could not be split and see what other options were available. When the manager finally made his way to our table, I was shocked by how unhelpful he was. He indicated that their point of sale system would only allow 4 cards to be processed on the same check and basically told us to figure it out. As someone who has previously worked in the restaurant and hospitality industry, I understand that there are sometimes system limitations. I asked if any of the checks could be transferred to \"open\" tables or \"to-go\" tickets so that they could be processed separately, he stated he could not do that. Again, we asked for any other suggestions and his answer over and over again was \"I don't know.\" By this time, we had grown increasingly frustrated and decided that we would all get cash and pay for our checks in cash. At this point, we were still trying to figure out who's was what and trying to add up everyone's individual totals. We asked the manager what the tax rate was so we could try to split the checks up and he didn't even know. He said he would try to find out and come and let us know. 20 minutes later with a pen, paper and a calculator we figured it out and we were able to pay for our bill in cash and get out of that place. The manager never came back by to tell us the tax rate or to apologize. My friends who were celebrating their birthdays left frustrated and embarrassed. Definitely, not how we hoped their dinner would go.   Being that this restaurant is located in the Aria Hotel we had great expectations when it came to the food and the service and we are sad to say that we were greatly disappointed and we left with a bad taste in our mouth --but maybe that was from the food.",

Pricier Mexican food but it's absolutely worth it and the service is above and beyond. Our salsa and chips never got past half empty before they were replaced with fresh ones. The same with our waters and margaritas. The food is incredible! We had the carnitas and steak picado, both excellent and not to be missed. Our server was very friendly and professional, excellent with timing, and made sure everything was perfect. Can't say enough about this place.",

    "text": "It's really hard not to fall in love with this place. As probably the most expensive mexican restaurant I've ever been to (coming from a guy who lives in Texas), I had really high expectations going in. Lets just say, Javier's over delivered.  Lets start with the good: - The decor of the place is absolutely stunning. Even considering that it's in Aria, Javier's look and feel of the restaurant is very modern and beautiful.  - The margaritas are perfect. Made with only top shelf tequila, you can assure that your $15 per drink won't go to waste.  Now to the great: - The service is on point. Filling my glass and refilling my sauce as soon as it's almost empty, and explained the overwhelming menu very well. - The sauce is redonkulous! Has a nice kick to it and isn't the ordinary blended sauce you will find in tex-mex establishments. Has a lot of flavor and chunks of great tomatoes in there.  And finally, the awesome: - My table did a little family style ordeal, so I was able to try a variety of dishes. Lets just say I wasn't disappointed by any of them, and each dish has it's own very authentic flavor. The seafood is very fresh, the meats are cooked perfectly, and there is some sort of latino flair in every dish that really puts it over the top.  Overall, this place is legendary. I would recommend Javier's to anyone.",

It was extremely crowded on a Saturday Night so reservations are highly recommended.  The bar was packed, but luckily our group had a table.  I ordered a delicious strawberry margarita.  For the entree, I had the taco plate with two shrimp, and one chicken tacos.  The entree comes with rice, beans, guacamole and sour cream.  The portion size was sufficient.  Someone in our party ordered the ceviche which was TINY.  The plate was children's size.  All in all, Javier's had delicious food, for an expensive price.  Most drinks are in the $18+ range and the main entree's are in the $40+ dollar range.  The service was average, but I would return again for the good food.",

I had to order my drink with two separate bar tenders before getting my orders fulfilled. Even on a slow night I waited 45 minutes for my medium filet Antiguo. Once my steak arrived it was extremely under cooked. When I sought my server he was extremely unapologetic and would take zero blame for their mistake. I went to find a manager and instead of resolving the situation he encouraged me to empathize with his servers mistake. The only resolution I received was my half eaten filet placed on the grill for a while longer. I  am thoroughly unimpressed and dissatisfied. Will not be a patron here again.",

As a Vegas local, those types of people are what makes this city go from classy to trashy. And for being such an impressive restaurant, you would think there should be a dress code and behavior code. Maybe if it was a little pricier the clientele would improve.",

My friends and I just went for appetizers and wine, so I can't comment on the entrees, but the foods we had to snack on were delicious. Even the chips and salsa were unusually good.

The service was excellent!  The food was perfectly seasoned, fresh and oh so flavorful.  The chips and salsas alone were a party in my mouth, and I had to hold myself back so I wasn't full by the time my entree showed up.  I ordered the Cabo Azul, based on the reviews I'd seen on Yelp, and it was fantastico! It seems like a lot of food, but everything was so light that the Maine lobster enchilada, grilled chile relleno (the pepper was a little undercooked but the flavor was still very good) stuffed with shrimp and crab, and a shrimp taco didn't make me feel weighed down.    Between the atmosphere (a little too dark in spots, making it hard to read the menu) -- if you can, sit back by the back wall and just stare at the wood carving and decipher the story it is telling -- and the service and food, there's just not too much to be disappointed with.  Being a local, the only drawback is the fact that I have to be Strip bound to get there.  Would love to see this gem in Downtown Summerlin hint hint nudge nudge",

I was a tad bit disappointed because I thought it would be table side guac, and they would make it in front of you like other mexican food places, but it wasn't. It was still good though.  I ordered fajitas, they were pretty good. My husband got Chile Rellenos combo plate and his food was realllllllllly good. His plate included an enchilada , a crunchy taco and a chile relleno.   We would def try this place again!",

    "text": "Very disappointing experience. I have eaten at all the Southern California locations, celebrating four of my last anniversaries at the Newport location, but this was a let down. We recently moved out of SoCal and had come to Vegas to see friends. Since we loved the other locations so much we thought it would be a great place to celebrate my birthday.  The service was very poor from start to finish. It took over 40 min to get our appetizer and almost as long to get drinks. Our water glasses sat empty more than they were full and the food was just average. By the end of the meal we just wanted to end this disaster so we gave the waiter our credit card and it took another 20 minutes and a follow up to get it processed. Not a birthday dinner I want to remember.",

So now I was expecting it to be well...amazing lol  We were seated right near the beautiful wood carving on the wall. For starters, I ordered the Pepino margarita and the shrimp ceviche. Both were great. For my meal, I ordered the Cabo Azul. It had just a bit of everything I wanted. Lobster enchilada, shrimp and crab chile relleno, and a shrimp taco with rice and beans on the side. It was all sooo good, I woke up today craving it. I also tried their jalapeno margarita, delicious, although I enjoyed the pepino a bit more. Definitely worth trying in Vegas!",

    "text": "Psychedelic decor, strong margaritas, attentive service, and healthy unhealthy food make Javier's a True Strip standout and a place worthy of repeat visits. The Javier's Margarita is strong and tasty - have a few and you just might sleep all the way home on your return flight to wherever you come from. The free chips come with a fresh salsa that packs a punch. The taco, enchilada, and relleno combo manages to be filling but not that \"I can't believe I ate all of that gloppy cheese\" kind of filling. The queso fundido and ceviche are good starters - although the ahi ceviche was a bit bland - and the corn cake with vanilla ice cream is a unique way to close the meal.  Service is attentive and very professional - as it should be for any spendy restaurant where prices far exceed normal Mexican fare. Last, but certainly not least: the restaurant's decor and design are out of this world and worthy of note. The tied rope chandelier (of sorts) over the bar would impress any badge seeking, knot tying Boy Scout, but the real piece de resistance is the intricate/disturbing/amazing wooden full wall installation that seems to be about the perils of colonialism. Edgy in a \"what restaurant would actually take this risk?\" sort of way. The indigenous (Aztec) wooden figures, the Spanish armada ship, the dia de los muertos skulls, it is not for the faint of heart and incredibly intricate and beautiful. It's also a sign that this place is next level in concept and delivery and worthy of your visit.",

    "text": "The only reason I ended up here on a random adventure is because my pops hit 2k at Aria within the first 5 minutes of being there. Random day indeed, but happy as ever. He treated us all to Javier's because he loves lobsters enchiladas like you wouldn't believe. He indeed had that and he said it was amazing. I cannot attest to that since I do not enjoy seafood much, but I will take his word for it.   As for me, BEST rice I have ever had thus far in my lifetime. I am a big big fan of (Spanish) rice. Anytime I can get it, I will. Unless I already know it sucks at a certain place, then that is a no go. However, Javier's is delicious, moist, mouth-watering. Whatever positive adjective you can think of, that is what it is. I wish I would have gotten more to go, but I was so full it didn't occur to me until later on when I was craving it.   The next best thing I had was the chicken enchilada and the crispy chicken taco combo. This is usually on most menus of the Mexican restaurants I go to, but of course I had to compare my favorite. The enchilada was good, but not exploding in my mouth good. The sauce was a bit on the spice side for my taste buds, but not too overpowering where I needed to drench my mouth with water. And the chicken taco was stuffed with crisp bites all the way. Usually tacos just have a little bit of chicken on the bottom and that's it, but this one had chicken with every bite. It was really good. And of course the beans were good, but not as good as the rice my friends!   Next, I washed it all down with a very delicious, but kind of on the small side, pomegranate margarita. They actually topped the drink with fresh pomegranate. It was very good, but for the price, I was expecting an actual margarita glass and not a rocks glass. Still good though.   Lastly, and my absolute favorite is the decor and atmosphere of Javier's. It is a dark glamour like feeling when you walk in. There was a lot of tree branch designs coming out of the walls, but my favorite was the one that held multiple bottles of what looked like tequila and other variations of liquor.  It was so pretty, I wish I could have it in my future house. The next best thing was the back wall mural of skulls and skeletons. It was just so mesmerizing to look at. I could stare at it for hours, just examining each piece (4).   This place is very expensive in some areas of their menu, but not too bad in others. My dish was only 19, not sure how much the drink was. I would save up to come here again for sure. Perfect for a nice date night. They also have a bar in the front. Such a neat place.",

Granted, it's not tex mex hot plate everything is drowned in 5 pounds of cheese Mexican food, but it's still Mexican food.   I would suggest not getting tacos or the same thing you get at your neighborhood cheapo joint. The steaks here are fantastic. The guac is very very good and is a must-order with anything.  I think if you're set on tacos or tostadas or something pretty similar to what you would order at Taco Bell, you're going to be disappointed with Javier's. If you're interested in fish and steak and other more adventurous options, you'll really like it.",

Today I called to book my bday party of just 12 and they are unable to accommodate separate checks. I won't be booking there.  I am sure their tourist business is good! Sadly, they are not embraced by locals and don't appreciate local business'. This isn't the OC!",

I ordered the Camarones con Rajas which he said were the spicier shrimp option, so I was slightly disappointed to find absolutely no heat whatsoever in the dish. It was good, just not spicy at all. My husband ordered the Fideo del Mar which he raved about, and my sister enjoyed the Carne Tampiquena. Her steak was not cooked to her liking but the flavors of the mole were very complex and delicious. Javier's Margarita was so fresh and wonderful and if you like mezcal then you definitely have to try the El Silencio martini. I was actually surprised there weren't more mezcal drinks on their menu.

I got shrimp ceviche and enchiladas Suizas. A shot of low end tequila was about 14 dollars ! I thought shot would make my margarita better but didn't. Food is made for a palate satisfied  by inauthentic Mexican cuisine, but it does look the part.

Hostess accommodated us 30 min before our reservation which was much appreciated. Place was packed but service remained attentive and rapid from promptly filled water glasses to menu recommendations. Food was good and fairly priced.   Pros: solid service, ambiance, food Cons: noise level a bit above average",

    "text": "Javier's is easily one of our favorite restaurants in Vegas.  On our last trip we dined here again and it was just as good as we remembered.  Reservations are usually not hard to get within a few days or hours of your visit, but if you have a large group be sure and make one.  The bar area is our favorite place to sit because it's a little quieter and brighter than a table in the back of the restaurant itself, and the bartenders and cocktail waitresses always have the best service skills!  The full menu is available in the bar, so you don't miss out on anything and actually get a pretty good view of the Casino to keep you entertained during your meal.  The food is always excellent, and this visit was no exception.  Guacamole was on point - creamy but with a little texture from the fresh tomatoes and onions, a perfect way to start our meal.  It's worth noting that the chips and salsa here are really delicious as well, but you really should try the guacamole if you are a guac fan.    Margaritas are always good - house on the rocks is a favorite of ours (simple, not too sweet, lots of lime flavor), and the skinny margarita is pretty good as well, but beware - the tequila flavor is strong, so if you need a little sweetness, just go with the house margarita and eat four less chips.  Pineapple margarita and blood orange margarita are our favorite fruit-flavored options, really smooth and packed with fresh fruit flavor.  Pretty much everything on the menu we have had is amazing, and they are happy to customize it however you'd like.  Ceviche on this trip was still fresh, flavorful, and a generous portion for a meal if you add a side of rice or beans with it.  The chicken tacos were light and nicely spiced - with fresh tortillas and some salsa for the top, they are a great lighter option if you are gearing up for a night at the tables.  Overall Javier's never disappoints every time we go.  While it does not have the best views of the Strip, it's definitely worth a visit if you are fan of Mexican food, or just really love a great margarita.  Cheers!",

It was cozy yet allowed us to people watch.  They serve a full menu in the bar area... so if you don't want to sit in the Dining area... grab a seat in the bar area.  It's just as nice.  We enjoyed a few fantastic Margaritas.  Not overly sweet... just the right balance of tequila, sweet, sour and tanginess.  Of course, we enjoyed the chips and salsa. Salsa is quite tasty... not too hot, not too sweet or tomato-y.  I ordered the Veggie Enchiladas for lunch.  YUM!  I'd totally get these again.  They were filling, but not heavy.   It's a bit pricey for lunch... of course, it might be all the margaritas we had too.  It's in a high-end hotel/casino bar so what do you expect?  I'm not complaining... merely stating that it is not a cheap place.",

ATMOSPHERE/ CUSTOMER SERVICE:  Once you walk into Javiers you actually forget its inside a casino, I went for dinner. It was dark with some Dias De Los Muerto like decor. Very unique and intimate, also a great selection of music. Loved the restaurant set up, I can't remember my waitors name but he was awesome, great attitude and positive vibe. Very much appreciated.   FOOD: Man oh man... I started off with the ceviche which I'm very very picky about. Super fresh and tender octopus, shrimp wasn't fishy, and had a nice citrus touch. I ordered the seafood enchiladas and my significant other ordered the carnitas. Both were outstanding. I'm not saying the enchiladas werent delicious but I definitely will be going back for my own carnitas. Cooked to perfection crispy outside and juicy inside, seasoned just right, best carnitas I've ever had in Vegas.  Let's not forget about the margaritas, nice and flavorful and strong. I got the jalapeno one, spicy kick, and the tamarind one was tangy. Recommend both. Even the salsa and chips were good here! All worth the price!   Will be going back for sure.",

I just moved here from Tucson, AZ so it has been a difficult adjustment when it comes to the lack of good Mexican food, to say the least. Javier's has been one of the better places to satisfy your craving for some south of the border cuisine.   The menu had classic Mexican dishes with original twists. One of my only complaints is that some of the dishes seemed to have a bit too much salt. The guacamole was amazing and you cannot have too many cucumber margaritas (except you definitely could because they are so strong.)   Great atmosphere as well. Really enjoyed it.",

It was the best Mexican food I have ever had!  We walked up without a reservation and did not have to wait for a table.  That was great.  We were quickly greeted with water and chips and salsa.  The salsa was so fresh, and delicious my husband did not even mind the cilantro in it (he usually hates cilantro)  The chips were crunchy and seemed freshly made.  Granted the food is a little expensive for Mexican food, but this is not expensive by Las Vegas standards.  I had the enchilada and taco combo, and I was not disappointed.  The food looked so nice on the plate and tasted even better.  The rice and beans were delicious also.  I had a strawberry margarita and was in heaven!  My DH had the combo with an enchilada, taco and chille relleno.  he loved every bite.  he had two margaritas and really enjoyed them.  Apparently the restaurant is known for their margaritas.  The bartenders were busy making them and from what I could tell, the whole restaurant was happy with them!  The service was great, the entire waistaff was dressed professionally in black ties and white dress shirts. They were quick to get you a refill and the food came out fast.  We are definitely going back to Javier's next time we are in Las Vegas!",

He put a combo together that wasn't on the menu so I could try both items I had asked about. I had the shrimp and crab enchilada and a steak taco. So good! My husband had the nachos as he wasn't hungry. He said the meat was perfect. Would come again and again!!!",

The steak was seasoned to perfection and was very tender. The beans were good and there was a nice accompaniment of veggies and condiments. The staff was very friendly and fast.  My only complaint is that of many other reviews, the food was good but not special enough to substantiate the cost. Our meal came to $65 and this was with no drinks.",

    "text": "We have eaten at Javier's 4 times and have loved the food and the Tamarind Margarita's which is why we chose to go back to Javier's in the Aria this past weekend while in Vegas.  We split the Cabo Azul which has been what we get each time we visit. This time when the dish arrived it was warm but not hot. I did not complain because I was hungry and it was not cold. My husband took the shrimp taco and I, the enchilada.   The waitress came by asked how everything was, we responded fine. Then we tried to split the relleno pepper, it was a tough pepper and difficult to cut. It was not thoroughly cooked, it was not soft or grilled as the item normally is nor was their much sauce atop of the dish. We ate a little bit of the inside on  1/2 the pepper. Then I said to myself for $36 this should be better and this dish is a 1/3 of what was ordered. We told our waitress, of our issue and she can also see the pepper and  1/2 the dish untouched. When she brought the bill I noticed there was no discount or any compensation for the bad food. I mentioned this to her and she said didn't my manager come over? We responded no. We waited over 10 minutes and had to tell her twice that no one had come to our table. Finally, 2 managers came by. (Meanwhile the restaurant was pretty full but not packed) We explained our complaint, their response was: We should have checked the pepper before telling our waitress everything was ok and also the waitress said some of the pepper was eaten. I explained I didn't think to try something I wasn't eating first, as I wouldn't want it to get cold and besides who would think it would not be cooked. They said they would make a bill adjustment and return. The bill adjustment was $6.00 off. Give me a break, Our 3 drinks were $48 and the bill still was over $80.00 and we get $6.00 off.  We told them this was our 3rd visit to this location and we've been to Newport Beach and recommended others. I do not think $6.00 off was enough, most companies do far more than what they need in order to make a good impression and have the customer leave with a good taste in their mouth wanting to come back. In Vegas there are choices and a ton of them. I will not give this location another chance, with poor management and handling off the problem they aren't worthy of our business. I understand things go wrong and aren't perfect, it is how someone handles the problem that counts.  Javier's in Vegas fell flat on their face.",

    "text": "I tried this place for the first time this past weekend for lunch and it was just ok. I might be spoiled with really good taquerias here in the bay area but the food was as good as mexican food at apple bees or something.  The salsa and chips they served were good. nothing special to write about except they were bottomless so it was a good appetizer. We did order some guac which was nice and smooth texture wise and stated creamy. It was pretty delicious.  A friend and I split / shared an order of shrimp enchiladas and an order of crab enchiladas. They were served wit refried beans, rice, and 2 enchiladas. The portions for rice and beans was small but they tasted just fine. The shrimp and crab meat was delicious but i think what threw me off was the favor of the enchilada sauce. The sauce tasted \"off\" but I can't really pin point what it was about the sauce but it just didn't taste right.   Comparing this place to almost any hole in the wall taqueria, this place had ok Mexican food but it was no where near the quality of a taqueria but costs double the price.   Overall, If you really want some mexican food, find a taqueria near by off the strip and you'll be better off. If you're really hungry and you're in the aria, I'd just go over to the aria cafe and order something there. While its not much cheaper, you have better options  for food at the cafe. Even if they had mexican food at the Aria Cafe, I'm sure the quality would be the same as Javier's.",

Javier's is just another Tex-Mex chain restaurant. People pay a lot of money $$$ & go here for the ambiance of the restaurant itself not the food. The Interior Design, the color scheme, Spacing, Lighting, & Sounds you see. The atmosphere comes at a cost. They make you feel comfortable and enjoy their experience so they'll have high levels of customer satisfaction & repeat customers, which means increased profit for them. The food on the other hand is no better then any low cost Tex-Mex chain like Chipotle, Baja Fresh, Qdoba, Moe's Southwest Grill, On the Border, El Pollo Loco, Chevys Fresh Mex, El Torito, Taco Cabana, or Pappasito's Cantina.",

Chips/salsa and nachos it is very American then mexican, nobody serve chips and salsa in Mexico it is tostada or bread. The place is only good for appetizers and drinks not main course. I judge quality of mexican restaurant by there mole sauce. It was very disappointing (worst I ever had) and chicken was hard like rock. Crispy tacos came with carnitas and restaurant was justifying it as beef and half a pound of non melted cheese. With this price point I would get amazing mexican food in bay area, I would suggest spend the money on slot machine you might get lucky.",

Dimly lit and intimate, this restaurant lives up to the hype.  And of course, they have a killer margarita menu full of all kinds of exotic flavors.  Here's what we ordered: We each had a margarita including one that was laced with jalepenos.  The margaritas are both power packed and unique.  They take some time to create but they are worth the wait. We started with the ceviche de camaron and of course the complimentary chips and salsa.  The table salsa is delectable and we gobbled it in a hurry with our drinks.  The ceviche is super rich in flavor and chunky.  Very tasty.  The serving size is enough to feed 2-3 people comfortably without being overstuffed. For dinner, I ordered the Pollo a la Chipotle.  Warning - if you've loaded up on the chips/salsa and anything else to eat before this, you will feel SUPER full.  This entree is delicious but it's seriously filling and rich in flavor.  The sauce is incredibly creamy and there is tons of it to lather the chicken in.  I passed on dessert because I was super full but I wouldn't doubt that it would be tasty!  Bring someone special here, you can enjoy a lovely candlelit dinner and some good eats while you're at it.  Sit near the door/windows and also people watch at the casino.  And of course, the service is exceptional.  You will love the treatment.",

    "text": "Definitely need to make reservation. This place is full 90%of the time !  This is a beautiful restaurant when it comes to decoration. I do personally think the tables are too close to each other, you can literally hear others' conversation even you don't want to by sitting right next to their table and also the booth seating is not facing the casino but rather facing another table. While we were there, we are a party of 3 girls and we had a booth. The whole time the couple, who were at the table right in front of us kept turning their heads to us. It is rather distracting for both tables. The restaurant has dark wood decor and their massive art piece at the very end on the wall. That's made by a famous Mexican Artist on a solid wood piece with a chainsaw. I highly recommend anybody who plans on visiting the restaurant or Aria check out this video : <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvegas.eater.com%2Farchives%2F2012%2F10%2F15%2Fwatch-the-worlds-largest-chainsaw-art-being-made.php&s=d8941cbb67b3f973f79b3ee813846d91f0a9c445a8cfd2558b1cbf2de90d5ff1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">vegas.eater.com/archives...</a>  When it comes to food, I am a big fan of their appetizers and frenshly made margaritas than their entrees. I ordered Seafood Enchiladas, it is fresh and tastes good but didn't really impress me or give me any wow moment. However, their cocktails are amazing. Between three of us, we had Jalepino Margarita, Cucumber Margarita and Tamary Margarita. They are all delicious. The bartender made them pretty strong too, and of course no complaints on that :-)  The service is the reason I only gave a 3 star for this restaurant. We were here for a work invite. Unlike any other restaurants, from the server, the busser to the manager, nobody knows what to do. The manager didn't come to the table and tried to \"sell\" the restaurant. The server didn't know how to handle the ordering. The busser came by 3 different times asking if we ordered bottle of water or tap water. I am not impressed at all. Another thing that I don't think this restaurant can rate itself as fine dining is that the server didn't bring our food together when serving, and they asked us who ordered what again after he had taken our orders.   I would come back for the drinks and appetizers for sure.",

We make reservations a week in advance and request a specific area and are often put at the bar area to be crowded in while spending $400+ on food and high end tequila. I love watching tourists be taken before us to the area we asked for and to be told we have to sit at the bar top where we have to stack our plates to eat! We come here so often the manager knows us but still we get treated like dirt. Yes we've tipped this guy and the hostess just so we don't have to deal with this and they act like they don't know us when we come! The food has gone downhill the last few months the steaks are chewy and waitresses don't give a crap about you. This last time the waitress didn't even check on us after the food had been delivered. This place has gone to the dumps and we refuse to eat here ever again! I will be telling all of my friends the opposite of what I used to say! It's so disappointing because we used to love coming here! You can tell this place relies on tourists FYI locals are what keep things going long term! Eat at Catch over here if you want to eat at aria this place is a waste!",

Beautiful ambiance in the place and a very cozy feel in the booths.   Staff is VERY attentive. Whether is was a manager, any of the servers, bussers, runners... there was always someone to take a plate away or replace our salsa. Our server was good! Food and drinks came out very quickly. When I felt my margarita was too strong he suggested a different margarita with a different tequila and I was quite happy. ** Get the pineapple margarita ** Margaritas range from $12-$16.   The chips were quite salty. Salsa ($0) & guacamole ($12) were excellent. Our enchilada entrees ($24-25) were good and no complaints really! Presentation is very nice. They weren't the best enchiladas we've had but good enough to eat most of our meal. The spinach enchilada is the gist of accommodating vegan/vegetarian diets, but better than just ordering a bunch of sides, right?! The chocolate cake was great with the dark chocolate ganache on top, but the ice cream on the side had a very \"icee\" texture to it.   May come here again for the perfect date night ambiance & the service.",

We actually had Javier's as a 'filler' restaurant since it was at the Aria where we were staying. It turned out to be one of the better experiences we had the entire trip!  It's said that it's difficult to screw up Mexican food - but I disagree. I believe it's difficult to get Mexican food right. Living in Texas, it's difficult to find good Mexican food outside of San Antonio, and even there it's difficult.  Surprisingly, Javier's does it right. This is not a dig on Javier's, but just an expectation to never find good Mexican food outside of Mexico, Baja California, or closer to Nogales, Arizona. Las Vegas was the LAST place I thought we'd find good Mexican food, but we were wrong!  We actually weren't that hungry, but we were thirsty so we started with a house special margarita and a jalapeno margarita. Added some chips, salsa, and guacamole to start. After a short conversation with our very friendly and knowledgeable server, we decided on the Mole Poblano and Steak Picado. It's difficult to judge a restaurant on just two dishes, but if these two were an indicator of the quality of the rest of the menu, we'll be back!  Overall, the food, decor, and service were excellent! Great Mexican food at rather palatable prices for being inside a Vegas hotel.",

We couldn't find a spot at the bar, an amazingly nice cocktail waitress saw us and pointed us to the lounge in the back that was open seating. Great job. Busser with the long mustache was a solid pro. Cleared the table, said hi and that he would be back you chips and water. She took our drink order, got us menus and treated us like VIP's even we we just had a couple of rounds of house margaritas( I actually enjoy jimador tequila). Amazing job, wish I could shadow the GM and floor manager. They do it right here.",

Unfortunately there food is very lack luster and mediocre at best. A friend of mine was playing poker at aria and suggested Javier's. I had only been there for cocktails in the past so I was excited to try the food. Boy was I let down. He ordered the lobster and crab enchiladas and asked for extra lobster and crab on the side, when the waiter brought it out he was wondering where the side of extra meat was. She stated that the cook had put it inside the enchiladas already. He was upset about that. I tasted it and they were extremely bland and underwhelming. The lobster was chewy and over cooked.I didn't have a huge appetite that night so I ordered an appetizer the chicken taquitos. Those were disappointing as well. I've honestly had better rolled tacos at Roberto's which I find odd being that this is an upscale restaurant. I have friends who've dined here a few times and they didnt care for the either. The service was decent not amazing. Overall I wouldn't recommend this place to a friend and I won't be back. It's extremely overpriced for what you get, they need to step there game up.",

    "text": "After having authentic Tex-Mex cuisine in Texas last summer, I thought it was time to have REAL \"Mexican\" food to see if it can be comparable to restaurants such as Anamia's in the Dallas/Fort Worth area.    That's where Javier's comes in.  I read that there are a couple of Southern California locations in both Irvine and Newport Beach, so Las Vegas shouldn't be any different.  My dad told me that [Javier's]' chips and salsa were to die for, and he was right.  The chips were crisp and hot, and the salsa had that nice \"cantina\" style taste like you would find in any Mexican restaurant.  For the appetizer, we did the Octopus Ceviche, which was GOOD.  The octopus didn't taste chewy, and it also included some scallop bits along with some vegetables such as cucumbers and avocados.  There was also a lemon wedge on the side in case you want a more citrusy taste to the Ceviche.  I ordered the Chili Negro which is a short-rib dish made with a chili negro sauce (hence the dish name \"Chili Negro), and the ribs had a really smoky taste to them, which I loved.  I was a bit disappointed that they didn't put a lot of rice on the dish (seemed like they only put one spoonful of rice on), and the sauce?  It's good, but people really need to know when to not overpowering the dish with such flavor (even though flavor can be a good thing).  Okay, I wouldn't want to fly (or drive, for that matter) all the way to Vegas for Javier's since they have a couple of Southern California locations in Irvine and Newport.  But, I'll definitely return to Javier's for Mexican food (just go to a place that's closer to me).",

I decided for my recent trip this past weekend, I'd try it out again. It was packed on a Friday night but we were seated promptly and I had to order my go to item cheese enchiladas with rice and beans. The waiter informed me there is lard in the refried beans but I didn't care because it is better than getting the regular black beans. We didn't have to wait too long and when our plate came out, I was in complete awe. The cheese enchiladas were plated nicely and taking one bite into it, I was in heaven. The cheese, sauce was perfection. The Spanish rice and beans which were on a separate plate were flavorful and authentic.  It was a good portion size and very filling! I hope we get a Javier's in San Francisco! Good service, great food this is one Mexican spot to check out!!",

When we were finally seated the wait staff was on top of things and very attentive.  The salsa was excellent and one of the best we have had at a mexican restaurant. The flan was also really good and the perfect texture but outside of those 2 items...food was mediocre and not worth over $100.  We tried the trio enchilada with the crab, lobster, and shrimp as well as the queso fundido and the fajitas de carne. All three of the items were served somewhat warm, not hot. The crab and lobster tasted a little fishy and I bit into a lobster shell in the enchilada...not cool. The shrimp was the best of the 3 enchiladas but not fantastic...especially since the plate was warmer than the actual food. The fajitas were ok but the meat was very greasy and again not hot but warm. The queso fundido didn't taste great...and was hard to eat because was again served somewhat warm so the cheese was like a big blob.   Overall I've had better quality mexican food but the biggest disappointment was that they didn't serve the food hot...it seemed like it had been sitting out a little while before it was served.",

The food was amazing, the server was ok.. seemed like he didn't care as much. What really made me upset was the fact that i went to the host stand and told them the restroom was a MESSSSS! Every stall was dirty, and had paper everywhere. I told them.... i came back 2 hour later for more drinks & then i had to use the restroom again & it was dirty !!!! I understand if it was busy, but it was 4pm & it wasn't busy at all and there was about 4 people in the front.   Food 5/5 Service 3/5 Environment was gorgeous but the restroom killed it 1/5",

The restaurant was packed so we didn't see him as much but everytime he was passing us by, he always asked if we were happy and made sure we got everything we needed. I'm very pleased :)   Now, food: We each ordered a house salad and steak fajitas to share.   House salad - ***** Absolutely fantastic! Crunchy lettuce, fresh tomatoes, radicchio, and ranch - so refreshing, light, and delicious! They also top their salads with cheese but I opted out, it wasn't necessary in my opinion.  Photo attached.   Steak Fajitas - ***** OMG! One of the best fajitas I've ever had (and I'm really picky!). Steak was perfectly cooked (medium, I highly recommend keeping it this way), juicy and tender; huge grilled juicy tomatoes (my mouth is watering, damn it....); perfectly sauteed scallions, onions, and bell peppers. Served with guac, sour cream, flour or corn tortillas, and refried beans. I don't eat beans so they sub'ed beans with Spanish rice. I didn't like Spanish rice much but fajitas were to die for!  Everything looked so good that I forgot to take a pic and remembered when everything was destroyed, sorry guys lol   They also serve chips and salsa as most Mexican restaurants do, but their salsa is delicious. Photo attached   It was a great experience, I will absolutely visit next restaurant next time I'm in Vegas.   Little tip: dont forget to give them your players club card when you're paying so that they add points to your account.   That's it, enjoy :)",

I even heard it is the best Mexican place around and a friend even boasted that another friend of his that was living in Mexico City would come to town and eat here! Having recently traveled to Mexico City (loved the food) I had to give it a try.   I was traveling for work and this restaurant is at the Aria, so super convenient.   Nutshell Service: Average Food: Disappointing Decor: Gorgeous  The truth of the matter is that the food is average and nothing to write home about. What's nice about this place? The decor.

We stayed at the Aria on this trip to Las Vegas and decided to give one of its many restaurants a try. My wife was dying for ceviche so off to Javier's we went.   The restaurant is located just off the gaming floor and has a really nice atmosphere, it has a bar with these ropes draped from the ceiling and it looks really nice. There are tables to eat at or you can eat at the bar and there is a lounge area in the restaurant, this is where we ate. It was very comfortable.   I had a beer and my wife had a water. They brought out chips and salsa. The chips were very fresh and crisp. The salsa was the best I ever had. It's had a great flavor and just the right amount of spice.   I wasn't that hungry and was more interested in a \"liquid\" lunch. The tasty chips were all I needed. My wife ordered the ceviche. The food came out quickly and she absolutely loved the ceviche so, we will be back to this restaurant next year when we return to Vegas. It was super spicy like she likes it. Perfect. The ceviche was reasonably priced At $55.   The customer service is top notch as with everywhere in the Aria. I don't know where they find all this great help but they need to send some of these people to Washington DC. So I can enjoy this great service at home.   I really like this place. It's a nice place to go and relax, have a cold drink and maybe watch a game on one of their TV's. Very Nice.",

This place is great for a romantic Vegas date or night out with a big group. The menu has so many great dishes it's hard to choose what to eat.  I believe the best judge of a Mexican restaurant is based on their chips and salsa. This place passed the test with flying colors! I have no clue how they make their salsa but I'd love to know. It's so addicting, it's nice and fresh with the perfect amount of spice. And most importantly they bring a fresh batch of chips in perfect timing they don't leave u waiting for half an hour.   The service has been great every time I've dined here. They bring the food in good amount of time. And they also offer burritos (not on the menu but if you ask they will make it, however I wouldn't recommend it stick to what's on the menu, the burrito was mostly tortilla, not much chicken inside). My fiance and I love this place and we make sure to eat here at least once every time we come to Vegas. So do yourself a favor and try it out!",

    "text": "The alluring atmosphere at Javier's called out to me. The curved architectural details fused with the white and dark colors presented an elegant Mission style ambiance that points to fine Mexican.  Wait, who am I kidding? it's the margaritas people!  Our 3 visits in a row is certainly a testament to their margaritas. If you're a margarita snob, this place certainly caters to your tastes: 14 different margarita combinations on the menu made with tequilas ranging from the affordable El Jimador to high end Casa Noble and even an organic one called Azunia!  Aiyayay. We just had to try several. The Casa one comes in cheapest at $13 and you can definitely taste the more grassy tones and sourness of the drink. Opt to pay the premium price of $18 for a well made Javier's: Patron Reposado, Grand Marnier and Triple sec. This was a smoother experience overall, but if you've been to Tommy's Mexican restaurant in SF, you'd probably say a margarita with Grand Marnier is essentially not an authentic one.   They also have fun flavors like the Jalapeno for a spicy kick, the Tamarindo and even a Paloma made with Casa Noble, if you're not in the margarita mood.   The complimentary crispy chips and red salsa with just enough kick kept my hand busy digging into the chips bowl. I love that I can carry a conversation here without having to scream to my partner and the service is always fantastic whether we sit at the bar or in one of the cozy leather booths.   Javier's got my heart racing for their hand shaken libations and my wallet crying every time I come here. I just close my eyes and pretend I'm on a beach somewhere in Mexico ...",

It has a nice Mexican facade when you see if from the gambling area and it has nice decor inside the restaurant.    Their guacamole and chips was excellent, after all it's pretty hard to screw up guacamole.  Service was excellent and their salad was good too but the main attraction for me was the main dish which was Osso Bucco.  It's listed as Ostilla De Res.  I found their menu hard to read cause everything was titled in Spanish and there were so many dishes to choose from.  Anyways, the Osso Bucco was excellent, the meat tender and flavorful with a bit of heat.  It was a great dish.  Margaritas were pretty good but could have been a little stronger for the price that was charged.    Overall, it was a good meal.",

Now that I'm a vegan, it is getting more difficult to frequent places that barely cater to vegans.  Although there are a few vegan options at Javier's, they mostly cater to non-vegans.  Luckily I have found vegan restaurants outside the strip.  I was disappointed recently when I asked one of the servers a question regarding the menu, he was a bit short with me. Most of the time, the servers are engaging and make the experience a memorable one.  Not this time.  I understand servers handle a lot of customers and it is a very stressful environment. However, next time I may break tradition and dine elsewhere.",

I love this place and come quite often maybe more then I should since I live 5 minuets away. I pretty much get the same thing the Steak Picada but they have this huge appetizer platter that I love as well. They have some secret salads you need to ask for.  So I don't really go into details about service or Decore because I'm here to eat food but the restaurant is top-notch, largest chainsaw wood carving in the country, big bar and service is always great and they are always ready and welcome to attended to every need.

You almost lose the casino/vegas feel right outside the door. The service was wonderful and we had no wait when we walked in at lunch for a table of 3.  We ordered the guacamole to compliment the chips and salsas we were given when we arrived. The guacamole was very good, but my one complaint is that it seemed like a smaller portion size than I was expecting for the price and when listed as a starter.  I had the chicken quesadilla for lunch. It was a massive portion and very tasty. The quesadilla was served with sour cream and guacamole on the side which was much appreciated. Others dining enjoyed two different salad options. All of the food was great!   I really also appreciate the quick service, we were in and out very quickly but at the same time didn't feel rushed.",

Javier while could be viewed as higher end Mexican/Spanish and not worth the price, I would disagree as they exceeded my expectations. Granted I came with were low expectations as the run of the mill Mexican places in every major city is all I know. This place is NOT that at higher prices, this place is a tasty, strong value restaurant in City Center.  We had the chile verde pork, skirt streak, taco/crab enchilada/lobster enchilada combo, skirt steak chopped salad, and ribeye.  All were expertly cooked and prepared.   Ribeye was medium pink all through. Significantly better than say my experience at CraftSteak. Pork chunks had a wonderful spicy sauce gravy kick Chopped salad was a very good blend of dressing, roasted corn, salad and skirt steak Cabo azul enchilada combo had PACKED lobster and crab, no fillers here.  You may not be a Mexican food fan like me, you may have a preconceived notion of how \"standard\" Mexican cuisine is like, but Javier's has made a lasting impression on quality Mexican cuisine and isn't just high priced because of location, it was because of quality as well.  Strong value. I'll be back.",

Literally no one came to our table 15 mins not even water service. Our 3 margaritas finally arrived just before 10:00pm, 25 mins for 3 of the speciality drinks.   The food took a while with no one popping by in between. 2/3 drinks were empty but service was nowhere to be found. Once arrived the food was amazing (shrimp enchiladas, crab enchiladas and the linguine pasta dish).  We sat there with our empty plates for 20 mins. The server looked at them multiple times but clearly relies on the busers for that so simply looked away.  I went to the front to ask a manager to help us check out and clear the dirty plates. I also let him know service was off.  He apologized and thanked me for letting him know but did nothing to bill to help compensate for a bad dining experience. Certainly not mandatory but having experience in the service industry it's very easy to take a round of drinks off the bill as an apology to show customers good faith. Our server gave us the bill and did not apologize for the service or lack there of.  Javiers is a great place but the service here leaves a lot to be desired, there are much better places in Las Vegas to get a great end to end dining experience that has both great food and good service.",

    "text": "Absolutely incredible! Definitely one of my favorite spots in town. Impeccable service, amazing food, and the most perfect ambience. All the excitement and fun you expect from a large mexican restaurant with the experience of an upscale dinner you hope for on The Strip. Javier's in the Aria executes everything to perfection and I can not be more impressed. Make sure to order the ceviche...the octopus is some of the freshest around. The carne tampiquena is delicious, and their popular Martini de Pera is a great addition to any meal. Chips & salsa are awesome...all of the wait staff work together so well, the experience is like no other. You will not be disappointed. Can't wait for many more experiences at Javier's!",

As soon you sit down,  chips and salsa comes to you. Refills are always on time and they always check to see how you are doing.  4.5/5  The food is okay.  Not worth the price due to the quality.  I ended up ordering costilla de res and ceviche de pulpo.  I know, this is a Mexican restaurant..  why would I order that?  Anyhow, The portion is great but if you are charging $42 for a short rib.  It better not be salty and tasting like salt.  I wasn't too please with the tasting.  But the  ceviche pulpo  was good.  3.5/5  Overall,  I will come back to actually try their Mexican food To give it a second try.  But I did enjoy their atmosphere and music.",

While the food matches in quality, the service is NO WHERE near as top notch as the other locations that I have been to.   We sat at the bar and waited 20 minutes before anyway asked what we wanted to drink.  We ordered margaritas, and then waited another 20 minutes....nothing.  We then tried to get any bar tenders' attention, to which we were ignored several times.  Once we finally got our tender's attention, we reminded him about our margaritas.  He said, \"oh yeah...\" and walked away.  Another 5 minutes later he hastily placed the margaritas in front of us and stomped away.  We then tried to ask for the check and were ignored so we just dropped cash and walked away.  This kind of service would never fly at the other locations and I was sad that our experience was not the best.  The margarita was good through.",

On to the food. We ate here twice. First and last night at Aria. That should speak for itself. La Tablita pork and steak. Margaritas are amazing.

It was dark, not too loud and overall very cozy.   We chose to sit at the bar and were we greeted and placed our drink orders very quickly. The bartender made our delicious drinks (Javier's Margaritas) right away and took our appetizer order of chips and guacamole. It came out quickly and was delicious.  The chips and salsa with the guacamole is a must order.   For diner, my wife ordered the carnitas and I ordered the enchiladas with chicken. Both were good but both were served at room temperature. If they would have been hot, we would have no complaints.   Overall, the drinks, food and service were all good. If you are staying in the Aria or across the street at the Vdara, I recommend giving it a try.",

Besides that, let's go with the ambience, the food, & most importantly the service.  1- Ambience was great, just a little dark, which means no good lighting for food pictures lol 2- Food: Chips & Salsa are great!! The 3 Plates we ordered were also great-(3 Taco Plate & the Enchilada+Taco+Chile Rellano Plate) only thing was that I wish my plate had more beans. It was like a spoonful :( 3- Service: Really good!! Our waters were never empty nor our salsa & chips.  Our food came out extremely fast & our server was on point!!   I definitely would recommend this place!!",

The reason for this review and the two stars is because their service is amongst the worst service ever, their waiters are rude and not accommodation at all, their hostess area is full of confused girls that have no clue about what they are doing. Their drinks are not the same and services staff is horrible. With so many good places in Vegas then this is rated amongst food court food and service when the other Javier's are amongst the best places in California.",

She was super helpful and very responsive to all my emails.   We were given the option to pick 5 entrees from a list of about 20 of their top plates to add to our prix fixe menu. Our guests were able to pick from a soup or salad, one entree, and choice of flan or fried ice cream for dessert. The price was fairly reasonable as well at $85 per head.... after doing my research and looking into several other spots in Vegas, many of the others had a minimum of $100 per head and their events managers weren't nearly as on top of things as Julie.  Our service was great..... two servers for our group. They were on top of everything, and no one ever felt like they were waiting on something for too long. Drinks were flowing so our guests were extremely happy.  I recommend Javier's to anyone planning a group event who's looking for fair pricing, great atmosphere, and awesome service. Will definitely be back!",

Aesthetics aside, the food tasted mass-produced.   I was with a group of 6 girlfriends and none of us were impressed. 2 of us ordered the $60 filet - I was immediately turned off by how over cooked it looked (both ordered medium rare), and watching both friends literally saw into it with their knives was painful. No amount of steak sauce could've revived the \"filet\". We were convinced that it was a cheaper cut of meat.   A great place to get drinks before a night out, but skip the meal!",

    "text": "Quick look: the hot / new \"upscale\" Mexican restaurant on the strip that is a scene as much as a great place to eat. Constantly busy during the dinner hours. reservations are suggested. Come prepared to eat and expect a loud, festive, environment!  In depth: Have eaten here twice and both times have been quality. Made a reservation last Wednesday night on the phone for the two of us. Arrive on time and the hostess cannot find a reservation under my name. Apparently the gent that answered the phone never put my reservation in the system. Rather than make us wait they did the right thing and got us sat immediately.   The service was prompt and they were on top of it. Seriously brought their A-Game and they worked well as a team. One would drop, one would clear, one would check on us etc. Was good to see a team properly trained. Or waiter was very professional and made two great suggestions for us. My lady ordered the Carnitas and I ordered a seafood mix that included crab. We also ordered some guacamole as an appetizer.   The guacamole was solid. This is a creamy guacamole and they definitely use sour cream in the mix. Could taste it. Was not prepared table side like other high-end restaurants do. Might have been too busy to consider doing that? Was quality though. Kudos.   The entrees were delivered with perfect timing. the first thing you will say is \"Wow!\" The proportions are massive and the presentation is over the top. They are served on very large plates and quite colorful. Really no complaints on the carnitas. They were amazing and cooked perfectly. My seafood dish was delicious and very filling!   Was no room for desert. I was in a food coma and struggled to regain my composure as we had to go meet some friends for drinks and table service at a nightclub at the Wynn. My advice, eat here if you know you will have a chance to rest afterwards. Mexican food is heavy and will weigh you down.   I would have given them 5 stars if not for the reservation hick-up. Love the room and the decor. Has great action at the bar. This is a quality high-end Mexican restaurant and I look forward to going back soon!!",

The food tasted good but I know I could get a combination plate and fajitas cheaper elsewhere.  My brother complained that the salsa they served tasted like it was from the jar, La Victoria and that they added a few cilantro leaves and peppers to make it appear fresh.  The plus side to this place is that they play really good music, the decor is cool to look at, and the service was good.  Overall, this place was A-ok in my book.",

It's located inside the Aria Casino, and its grand entrance with large ropes hanging over the open bar lure you inside. It's simply stunning! I never thought I would use the word \"pretty\" to describe the interior of a Mexican restaurant since so many are kitschy, but pretty it is.  My husband and I were seated in the bar area for lunch. We had a large rounded booth all to ourselves... in case we wanted to take a siesta after our meal, I suppose. The fresh chips and salsa are so addictive. We went through a basket and a half before our entrees arrived. What can I say? I'm a small girl with a large appetite.   I ordered three separate items... chile relleno, cheese enchilada, and chicken soft taco. The chile relleno was awesome! It had a crispy coating and a thick cheesy center. It was my favorite of the three, though all were extremely good. My husband ordered chicken mole, which came with flour tortillas and all the fixings. The chicken was still on the bone, but was so moist it just pulled right off. Both meals were served with rice and beans. I normally don't eat the rice and my husband usually doesn't eat the beans. On this occasion, we both cleared our plates. All ingredients were so fresh and the flavors just jumped out at you.  I would come here again in a heartbeat the next time I'm in Vegas. I need more Javier's in my life... Bring a location to St. Louis!",

For dinner, I ordered Carne Tampiquena. It's probably one of the top 5 steaks I've had in my adult life. It was tender, juicy, flavorful and perfectly cooked to medium. The Chicken enchilada and taquito that accompanied the dish were great as well. The house chips and salsa are addicting. I'll definitely dine here again.",

Managers leadership skills are terrible he needs to improve so many aspects of it.",

    "text": "Yes, it's more than you will pay for a taco at Los Tacos. Yes, the average entree is around $22. But, yes, that is how much it generally costs to eat on The Strip. With that out of the way, on to the important stuff: eats and environment.   The restaurant is expansive, open and sexy, which means it would make a solid date spot. Dark woods and conversation pieces, including an impressive rope centerpiece at the bar and a huge chainsaw carving, make dining here interesting and inviting. I have dined at a table and at the bar, and both spots were comfortable. And, we received great service at both.    The menu is extensive with options for everyone from a vegetarian to a steak lover to a pescatarian, so I think it will be easy to please everyone in a large party. Each meal starts with delicious chips and salsa, and if you want something with a strong kick, be sure to request the habanero salsa. The guac is not tableside, and it is pretty simple, but we have ordered it both times! As for entrees, my husband ordered the Azul trio which included a lobster enchilada, a relleno stuffed with crab and a shrimp taco. I could spy drool spilling from the corners of his mouth just looking at the plate. I have sampled the Chicken Picado (menu only has steak, but they made chicken by request) and the Mole. Both were fresh, well-prepared and generous.I can't say that the food is conquering new territories of culinary adventure, but they do Mexican well.   I also spied tables with the tablita, a giant tray for two people to share create your own tacos. Next time, I want to try that.   I haven't tried a margarita here, but listening to the bartenders, it sounds like they can make a primo one.   Overall, what really pushes Javier's into a spot worth trying is the amazing ambiance and solid service. If you get there and there is a wait, remember bar seating is all first come, first serve!",

I didn't eat the ceviche appetizer as I am a picky eater, but my co-workers loved it. We also enjoyed our margaritas, which were excellent. For the main course I had the filete costeno, which was an 8 oz filet mignon and a Maine lobster enchilada. The steak was nearly perfectly cooked, and the lobster enchilada was delicious. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to others.",

Not burning hot but enough to get your attention.  Enchilada's for dinner. Chicken with rice and beans. My wife had the chicken breast in a red sauce with home made tortillas. Now there was something special, I love home made, hot flour tortillas. Excellent.  One more thing, fantastic margarita's. Try the \"Javier\". Top shelf tequila, Cadillac style.  The service was good, and they made sure that you enjoyed your meal.  Long and short, it's a bit expensive but worth every penny.   They have a number of locations, got to believe they will be as good as Vegas.",

    "text": "I have been eagerly anticipating trying this new restaurant, as it is open late, at Aria, and I am a big fan of the Mexican restaurants at MGM properties (e.g. Diego, Border Grill) so I had high expectations.  The decor is similar to Lemongrass, with suspended rope effects and lots of wood. The dim atmosphere is very appealing, I prefer dark to light in a restaurant. The skull-themed chainsaw wood carvings on the East wall are a fantastic touch.  And the food? Some of the best fresh tortilla chips I've ever had, thin but not too thin. Perfect house salsa, again thin but not too thin, medium-ish spice. Amazingly, you can polish off this entire basket (it's inevitable) and not feel like you've ruined your appetite. As with other MGM Mexican spots, ask for the secret Habanero Salsa - the one at Javier's is cooked with a hint of butter, served warm and comes out orange.  Guacamole ($10) - a generous portion, and I prefer Javier's kitchen-made guac to others' tableside versions. Cabo Azul ($28) - Lobster Enchilada, Chile Relleno w/Dungeness Crab and Shrimp, Bonus Ensenada-style Shrimp Taco, Black Bean dip and Rice. Recommended by our server. Delicious and almost overwhelming in terms of deciding where to start and planning my last bite. A fun mini-buffet of Mexican-style seafood. A winner. Got to taste the Chicken Picado ($22) as well - very tasty char-broiled chicken flavor.  Cesar, our server, was friendly and made some great menu suggestions. All of the server assistants did a superb job at keeping our drinks and chips topped off.  Excited to try the rest of the menu. LOTS of appealing items on it. It would be easy for me to proclaim that this food is 'overpriced' and give it 4 stars instead of 5, but I think if you choose to eat here you know exactly what you're getting into. If you want 'cheap' Mexican food you probably know exactly where to get it. (My 'cheap' Mexican spot is Tacos La Mexicana on Decatur & Twain: $5.49 for 4 Tacos, Rice, Beans and a Drink!)  Las manzanas y las naranjas...",

The salsa that comes with the chips was flavorful.  The margaritas (especially the Granada, with pomegranate) were delicious.  And service was prompt and friendly.  It's a bit on the expensive side: $20 for 2 enchiladas and the standard sides of beans and rice.  I liked the drinks so much that I came in for happy hour a few days later.  This time, I sat at the bar, and despite the fact that there appeared to be as many bartenders as patrons (three), it took nearly 10 minutes to get someone's attention and place my order.  Still, the margaritas were again delicious.  Worth checking out, keeping the price point in mind.",

I arrived 25 mins late to my reservation (hard time catching cab)when we arrived they skipped us. Which is fine long as we get the next opening seating. We waiting over 1 hour and  I noticed people that had just signed in were being seating before me and my group. So I went to talk to the assist manager. Which was lady I asked why it was taking so long..  She gave me the worst attitude ever so I told her she was ruining my special day being that I was the bride to be.. She told me \"WELL NEXT TIME DON'T BE LATE TO YOUR OWN PARTY\" than walked away from me when I was talking. I was livid!!!! I seriously wanted to slap her! I never in my life been treated so badly! So I complain to the Restaurant manager and told him how horrible that assistant manager was treating me, than he tells me the assitant manager was his wife!!!?? What the heck?? So obvi hes not going to reprimand her cause they're married. Total BS. The manager tried to make things right and got me a drink at the bar, but the damage was already done. My party didn't want to wait any longer at another restaurant so we just stayed. By the time we sat and eat we had waited over 2 hours.   You would think I get best service being that it was my bachelorette party but no.   Totally ruined and put a damper on my night. Worst experience ever!! I tried to find a corporate number to complain but couldn't fine one..  HATE JAVIERS",

I highly recommend the margarita infused with cucumber--I had my reservations, but it was so refreshing, and offset the bitterness of the tequila perfectly. The quesadilla with shrimp and dungeoness crabs was nothing sort of miraculous.  The service was a bit slow (I was with a large party, and the servers weren't even close to getting everyone's food out on time--we all ate in shifts), and the food is somewhat pricey, but it's definitely a venue to visit.",

My chicken polbanas enchilada was on par with my favorite in Santa Fe and the scallops were fresh , seared perfectly and met the exacting standards of my wife, the persnickety Mingster. They charge a good buck for the food, but amazingly it was worth it.

It wasn't the BEST restaurant we hit up during our last stint in Vegas but it delivered what we expected; at the price we expected.   Ambiance is great, location is super convenient but really just stop in for the Jalapeno Margarita; it's totally worth the pitstop and they don't skimp on the alcohol.   PS: We also enjoyed nacho's, and tacos (carnitas and shrimp) but the margarita and chips were what we stopped in for; and remained the highlight of the meal.",

The decor is stunning - very modern gothic/ ranchero - with dimmed lights, not your typical Mexican restaurant. If you can, sit in the booths by the bar. They are very cozy and spacious. They have a good variety of drinks and food. Food prices start from about mid $20s for very filling and yummy dinner. I had steak picada and it was delicious. Even though my drink - Noche Azul martini - cost me almost as much as my entree (drink was $18), it was super tasty. Not too sweet and with a kick to it. If you're in the area, definitely give it a try. You won't regret it!",

But there were definitely others waiting in line trying to get in. The physical restaurant is nice, we got a booth for five, one of us had to sit in a chair in the aisle. But, EVERY, SINGLE thing that was served was great. Really enjoyed the crab and shrimp enchiladas, the beef dishes were great, the empanadas and just everything ruled. Everyone loved it, and most said it was the best Mexican food they've ever had. If you're in Las Vegas, you should definitely stop here if you enjoy Mexican food.",

Take your time perusing the menu.  They have a fantastic selection from meats, to seafood, to what I would call \"mexican combo\" plates but that would be a \"misnomer\" from what we are used to at normal tex-mex places.  This is a GREAT date place, too.  But make reservations.  It can get busy on a weekend.    The decorations are amazing and noteworthy.  The photo of the wood carving I'm attaching supposedly has the owners caricatured in the top right corner.  There is also a glass margarita tree that is part of the decor that looks a little Chihuly'ish, if you know who he is.    All in all can't miss place!!  Highly recommend everyone trying it.",

I think it's overpriced but truly innovative menu with well-executed traditional dishes as well.   But it's very good. My verde enchiladas were 22 and perfect. I don't think it's any better than Rosa Mexicano, however. And the chicken enchiladas suiza are 16 or 17 there and you get rice and beans on the side. I don't know how prices at the Aria branch compare to the Newport Beach location, but since I avoid the OC like an STD, I will never know.   I was at Fashion Island this summer and yes, that's a very pretty place to shop. But other than Laguna, I despise the OC except for the secondhand/designer resale which truly is outstanding both in terms of quality and value.   But I didn't like anything about Newport Beach, not even the beach and couldn't wait to return to WLA and cross the border back from the Orange Curtain back to civilized Los Angeles.   The spicy red salsa deserves all the praise it has received from Yelpers.   I didn't get adventurous with cocktails and in fact, didn't even drink wine. But everyone says their specialty cocktails and various margaritas are noteworthy.   It's wonderful food but you'll spend more than Rosa Mexicano in NYC or LA and, with a few exceptions (the lamb shank over orzo with the best greens you will ever eat), Montecito's Cava.   Bartender--Tina, I believe but it could be Tara so I apologize if I have gotten it wrong--is not only beautiful but smart and a great bartender with a great personality.",

The margaritas were fantastic as some on them are really strong.  The guacamole was just how I remembered it when I was in Mexico.  The service we had at the bar was second to none.  Definitely if your craving some good Mexican food check this place out you won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "--Rant---  BEST dining experience I've had in Vegas thus far.  Ok so this was Thanksgiving weekend so naturally it was super packed and wait was relatively reasonable as such (30+ mins). The front desk ladies were a little snooty but I guess that's natural given the hotel they are located in (perhaps its their assumption of uber-rich people 24-7 and my gf and I weren't exactly dressed-to-impress haha).  After being seated, we were immediately greeted by our waiter. Super friendly guy, great attitude and huge smile. Probably received a huge tip from the previous patrons!  Throughout the entire time, this guy came by and asked how we were doing, how the food came out and was cracking jokes.  Amazingly attentive and great sense of humor!  Ok so in terms of water, they come by plenty to make sure you are sufficiently hydrated.  I love this and always notice it when an establishment fails to provide me a full glass of water on a consistent basis, even to the extent that when I'm eating at a restaurant that does NOT do this well, I always ask for TWO glasses of water when they initially provide it!  As for the food, I had the seafood enchiladas...HOLY SHIT these were good.  I mean, beyond what I thought it would be. One lobster, one crab (I think?) and one shrimp. Whatever the sauce or seasonings used were, they must have been made with unicorn dust or cocaine or both. Even without the sauce, the freshness of ingredients and seasonings brought out the food's natural flavors beyond that of the sauce. A rather natural blend of flavors made for an extremely memorable food experience.  I forget what we had for dessert but it was like some vanilla ice cream with flan?  Something super sugary but equally delightful w.r.t. taste. Again, sprinkled with either unicorn dust, cocaine or both, I just remember it blowing my mind completely.  ---Overall---  Service: A+  Our waiter rocked. Service Game on point~  Food: A+ Unicorn Dust and Cocaine I kid you not...  Atmosphere: A. I didn't care for bar atmosphere so much but we were their for dining and the dining area was superb..  Value: A+. Again, BEST dining experience I've had in Vegas thus far. Value exceeds price paid.",

I figured since it was Mexican food that the portion sizes would be generous, and I was right. We were celebrating a 21st birthday and I needed a restaurant with a upbeat atmosphere but still had some class to it and I felt Javier's was perfect. The food was delicious, and the free chips and salsa while we waited were enjoyable. My husband ordered a Pineapple margarita and I got the pomegranate one. You could actually taste the alcohol and it was more than just mix! When making the reservation, I made them aware of the birthday we were celebrating and they brought to our table a plate of Flan with a candle on it. The flan was sweet and so cute! In total for for our two entrees (a carnitas plate and carne asada salad) , 2 drinks and a taquito appetizer we just hit $99 and I was extremely happy with that price along with the service and quality of food.",

Order it medium rare. It is so tender, you can literally cut it with a fork. It is served over a garlic buttery sauce and it is just amazing. The lobster is smothered in poblano peppers and onions. It is an amazing mexican twist on an American classic. GO.",

We were a group of 4 (all locals) dining before a show.  Two of us got there early and ordered drinks from the bar.  The bartender, Cara was VERY ACCOMMODATING, really nice and made us martinis that were not on the menu.  She took an idea of the flavors that we were looking for and she made a PERFECT Martini.  The other two in our party arrived, we closed out our tab with Cara ($14 per drink) and we were seated.   Luis was our waiter during dinner and did a fantastic job.  We ordered food and continued to order the same Martinis at dinner (we told Luis to go to Cara since she had made the original Martinis).  Dinner was good and then we received the bill.  The Martinis were now $17 instead of the $14 that we were charged at the bar.  I questioned Luis and he said that we were charged the wrong price at the bar and that $17 was the new and correct price.  I explained that it wasn't right to charge $14 at the bar and then $17 at dinner.   We thought that they were $14 and happily paid that at the bar and continued to order because we thought that they were $14.   He offered to get the manager, Guillermo.  Guillermo came over and we explained the situation that we had a couple Martinis at the bar for $14 and then at dinner, they were $17.  Guillermo said that $17 was the right and a fair price for the Martinis and that he would not change it.  I explained that it was not our fault if they charged us the wrong price at the bar but since we had already started drinking the Martinis at one price, didn't he think it would be fair THAT NIGHT to let us have the other two that we ordered at the same price.  He said, NO.  We explained that we were locals, frequented the restaurant and were disappointed in the way that he was handling the situation since we were now arguing over $6 and he said that he would not adjust the price for the Martinis, that was their price and it was a fair price for the Martinis.  He then went on to tell us that he would be writing up the bartender who made us the drink and she would be disciplined.  What manager does that?!?!?  Why in the world would he tell us about his disciplinary actions towards his employees!!!????  I made sure to tell them that even though Cara may have made a mistake on the price, she was certainly a very good bartender and she should not be written up.  We then told him that we would never return to that restaurant, and he said that was fine and walked away.  I was astonished that a MANAGER at a restaurant of that caliber would talk to us that way, give us his disciplinary action details and not adjust the price of their Martinis to a price that we had already been paying and argued with us over $6.  Our argument was based solely on principle....when you charge a customer one price for something and then less than one hour later charge them more for the same item, THAT IS WRONG and he could not and would not see that or change it.  What if the difference had been more than $6??  What if it had been food?  I just can't see how you can run a restaurant that way and we were certainly NOT looking for freebies or handouts....we were just looking for a manager to DO WHAT WAS RIGHT!!!   We asked our waiter, Luis for any other managers names so that we could make a complaint later and he gave us a couple of other names and we paid our bill and were about to leave.   As we were about to leave, the General Manager, Moises came over and asked what the problem was.  We explained again and he understood and offered us a drink at the bar since we had already paid our bill.  While we were explaining the situation to Moises, the people dining next to us were frustrated too and spoke up....so at that point, I think Javier's had two tables of four people that were not happy at all.  We had to be at the show in 15 minutes and could not accept his offer for a drink, so he gave us his card and said to call him before dining there again.   The problem is that I am not sure that I want to dine there again and I am not sure what he would even do to make this a better experience.   I really have a bad taste in my mouth from the manager, Guillermo and how he handled their customers.   I have NEVER seen a manager handle a situation like that before and was SUPER DISAPPOINTED (and we have all been in the industry in the past as well)!!  In my opinion, I think Guillermo needs some additional training on customer service before they allow him to deal with people in the future!!",

The only downside is the very expensive prices.  It's a delicious place to eat, but you may be able to do better for less down the road.",
