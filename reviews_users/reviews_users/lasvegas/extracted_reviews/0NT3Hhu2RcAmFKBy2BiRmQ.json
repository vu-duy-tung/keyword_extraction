    "text": "I wanted to try this spot for months! After seeing them featured on Diners Drive ins and Dives I've been salivating at the sheer thought of my arrival. So I finally made it there last weekend, cute spot has a cozy authentic diner feel. I wish the lighting in there was better though, I had a really hard time reading the menu. Our Server seemed very knowledgeable about the items and was able to make a few suggestions. I went with the spicy honey chicken biscuit and cheesy grits. My husband had pancakes and Turkey sausage, he was definitely pleased with the quality of both and even said their coffee was decent. My breakfast sandwich was ok....what made it for me was their buttery biscuit, the best I've ever had... I could do without the chicken however. The strawberry butter tasted artificial I'm not a fan. The cheesy grits were an epic fail, I'm a grits gal, and they totally messed up my grits. Too watery, and had too much black pepper. It was not good. Our waiter then started to drift off and was no longer attentive to our needs, he had the label Trainer on the back of his shirt but seemed to be gossiping with his coworkers instead of actually training smh...you would think if the customer mentions the only reason why they came in was because they seen it on Drive Ins Diners and Dives, it should be clear indication they would be writing a review about their experience after the fact , so wouldn't you want to be on your Ps n Qs? Maybe its just me",

I was happy to find that the same great food and service was also at this location. I think, I prefer the Richmond location, the Henderson location lived up to my high expectations.

    "text": "My first visit here was about 2 months ago. I'm not entirely sure when this place opened but I knew it was fairly new. Either way, I ordered the San Francisco Benedict. The atmosphere and everything seemed great. When my food arrived and I took a bite, I realized I had been given the wrong dish as this one was called the Sandi Benedict and had spinach in it. It wasn't a huge deal to me. I really just wanted avocado, so I let the waitress know I had been given the wrong plate. She said she'd fix it and went to the back. I decided to stop eating as I wasn't sure if they were just bringing avocado or if they were bringing a whole plate out. After about 5 minutes of my boyfriend eating and me waiting, a manager came over and asked if everything was okay. I replied that yes as the waitress said she was handling it. Another 5-10 go by and I hadn't heard anything. I was hungry and now my food was cold so I just started eating it. Finally, the waitress comes out and asks if the manager handled my issue. I told her that I told the manager she was handling it. She ran off to figure it out I guess. I ate my cold food and was very unhappy. The manager came over later and apologized and told me that the waitress hit the wrong item on the tablet and they are so busy with trainees that it was chaotic. She gave me a $13 voucher and did not charge me for my meal. She assured me that it isn't normally like that, so I accepted this and planned to return in the future. I would like to mention that the food was good, but the experience wasn't.  I returned just this last Saturday intending to use the voucher and give them go #2. We had a young male server this time. He was nice and polite. I asked him how their herbal tea is (as that is all it was listed as on menu) and he said he hadn't tried it but knows it's some sort of seasonal harvest blend. I agreed to try it. When he brought it and ran off, I noticed he brought me coffee. I waited for him to come back around. I'm really trying at this point to give this place a chance but it was striking out again already. When he finally returned I clarified that I asked for tea, to which he said he thought I asked for coffee and he said he'd bring the tea. When the tea came, the water in the pot was basically almost room temperature. It was just lukewarm. I was sort of done trying so I just lived with it. I ordered the same thing I intended to have the last time. When the food finally came, my hash browns were nice and hot, but the eggs were again room temperature. Not even the slightest bit warm. I didn't complain. I just ate my cold food and made the decision I won't be returning any time soon. Again, the food is good (Should be at least warm) but my experiences here have not been the best. Maybe I'll give this place a year or so to get things together before returning. I've never been anywhere where I have had back to back not so great experiences. I gave it 2 stars for the food being okay alone.",

They had a decent crowd already  there because duh the foods amazing! Idk if I can say the same for the staff there. Me n my daughter waited for 15 min for our waitress to come to the table. Her name was supposed to be Nina or somethin. I'm never met her. While I waited a waitress by the name of Ida asked if we've been helped. I told her no so she took our drink orders and said she'll have Nina come over to us. No Nina. Ida returned back and said no worries, I'll take your order and she also apologized for the wait. Wow. It wasn't even her fault. 2 different staff members brought us our food which was incorrect but I got more food than I was supposed to. As long as I wasn't charged. The lady placing the food in front of us told me to hurry up and grab my plate cause it's hot. HURRY UP???!  Well bitch ur a waitress wear a damn waitress sleeve. U can make them out of a sock! I eventually grabbed the plate but I was hesitant because it wasn't correct. Smh.. anyway I guess she tried to argue with me. Big no no. I just wanted to make sure i didn't have someone else's order from another table n i wanted butter not an argument. The manager is nice.. he walks around and ask how you doin. It's hard to pay before your food you might be interrupted by a rude waitress. I will return only because I want to be seated in Ida' s section.  She's a hustler a go getter n a hard worker! Corned beef hash was nasty af btw.",

The wife got the Monte Cristo and my daughter the Fruity Waffle. The proportions were good, although the waffle was just a Belgium waffle with a little fruit. She got a side of bacon making it the most expensive dish at the table. She said it was strangely dry inside and our waffles at home are better. The Monte Cristo was huge, but the batter was very thick and grease would run down her hand when she bit into it. My Reuben had a good amount of corned beef. I had mentioned that the photos on Yelp varied greatly as to the amount of meat. The waitress confirmed that it does vary a lot. I asked for the fuller version. The corned beef was good, but the sandwich as a whole was kinda strange. First of all it was very juicy for a sandwich. Juice (juice, grease, sauce?) would run down my chin when I bit into it. Usually you can easily identify the cheese, sauerkraut and sauce but in this I couldn't. It seemed like it was all one thing. It was also really strong and overpowered the meat. Very messy to eat. We went away very disappointed.",

Our server was helpful and we both picked the same entree in spite of all the choices. So...San Fran Eggs Benedict for both of us and I removed the Canadian bacon cause I wasn't paying attention or I would have asked for spinach instead. Asked for my eggs to be poached to a medium so the whites are done and they got that just right. They were good but we both thought the soggy English muffins were a bit of a bummer. Missed the crunchy texture because the eggs, tomato and avocado all soft, needed to be crisp muffin. Hash browns were crispy although a tad oily for me. All in all we both cleaned our plates and are looking forward to coming back and trying some other lunchie choices. Great place!",

From them moment I opened the door and the smell hit me I was happy.  Smelled so yummy.  The service was very nice friendly and knew their menu well.  Asked several questions and answers given right away.  Hate asking questions and getting the old I don't know I will find out.  The burger was soooo good...   Half pound of Angus beef burger topped with lettuce slaw (shredded lettuce, chopped pickle and mayo) in between two grilled cheese sandwiches stuffed with American cheese, ripe tomatoes and our own cherrywood smoked bacon.  Sooo yummy.  Try this place you will love it. I will be going back for sure...",

Janice had a southern omelette that comes  with toast and a bowl of melon and strawberries. Colleen had crispy bacon,  eggs and fresh hashbrowns that were absolute perfection. I opted for the meatloaf dinner that comes with mashed potatoes and grilled zucchini. The meatloaf,  along with the fried chicken and waffles are their most requested dinners and I can see why. Everyone of us absolutely loved the food....fresh, hot and perfectly done.  The only downside: the coffee could be a little richer with a little more body, but that's how we saw it.

    "text": "American diners- images of hot waffles, cups of coffee and hearty meals come to mind. Metro Diner certainly delivered to my expectations of diner comfort food. I have seen the location on Rainbow, but I am elated they opened another location in Henderson.   I went on a Sunday morning and it was packed, but was seated in about 2 minutes by a very friendly host. The server, Leah, was very sweet and knowledgeable. There was sincerity in the customer service I can appreciate. She went over the menu noting the items highlighted in green are items unique to their diner and/or has been featured in the Fiid Network's show-Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives. They also feature flavored coffee and flavor iced teas that changes daily. Also, breakfast is served all day and evening. There is plenty of staff working the kitchen and the dining area, which was great to see because it was so busy, but no one looked frazzled and patrons were checked up on frequently.  I tried the Monte Cristo and John's Senior's sandwich. The Monte Cristo was huge! Definietly a shareable plate. It came with a side of I think blackberry jam which added a bright and fruity note to the very filling battered and fried sandwich. The turkey was very moist and the ham was not too salty. Did I mention the jam? Be sure to dip the sandwich in it! It went surprisingly well together.   The John's Senior sandwich was named after the owner's father because he came up with it and was one of his favorites. It had bacon, swiss cheese, 2 sunny side eggs (cooked medium) and a slather of good ol' mayo. Served between two sliced multigrain bread. The egg yolks oozed ever so slightly and the tang of the mayo went well with the smoky bacon. For something so simple, it was done well.  Server came by with the tablet to pay. You can pay with plastic or cash. I was a little thrown off if I needed to pay a little early since I was still working on my meal, but I didn't mind since I was able to finish my meal at the end without feeling rushed.  All in all, service and food met my expectations of comfort diner food. Genuinely friendly and efficient staff. Plenty of other diner items to try in the future. Will be back for sure. Welcome to the neighborhood Metro Diner!",

After  a few minutes the server arrived, we placed our order and as she was walking away - we let her know what we wanted to drink - Yes she forgot to ask, before leaving the table. To our surprise they had flavored pumpkin spice coffee,  It was was very good.  I ordered the Western omelette, which I found flavorful but lacking any real amount of ham. Hash browns were good and crispy but the portion was small. Wifey liked her veggie omelette and the tomatoes that were served in place of her hash browns (she's always watching the carbs). She was offered fruit or tomatoes at no extra charge.   Service was good, maybe a little inexperienced but very nice.  Good thing we arrived early because by the time we left, people were lining up inside and out.  I'm not sure I'll be back for breakfast, but I will try their lunch / dinner menu. I was informed that they serve their entire menu breakfast/lunch/dinner all day.  No delivery at this time, but you can place an order and come pick it up.",

Going to checkout we asked if they do a military discount and the waitress said I think we do let me check. Minutes went by and we were still waiting. We just ended up walking up to the front to get our check and she said I'm sorry she still hasn't done it but it's only like 10%. I said at least it's something and she continues to say that her manager is always up there bothering them to do stuff she can't believe that she isn't up there. After saying that she gave us the bill and said so it's going to be x amount. I was amazed.   I work costumer service and am a manager at my job. Never do we speak badly about our managers especially to our customers.   Also, the food wasn't all that good either. Nothing to rave about and the lack of urgency just killed it all.   I was hoping this would be my new go to restaurant but I probably won't go back.",

The salad with chicken was a monstrosity. Veggies of a rather low quality overall. Classic burger was pedestrian. In short, there doesn't seem to be anything to distinguish this diner from any other in Vegas and it's no better (possibly worse) than a Denny's. Would try again for breakfast...maybe.",

We've gone to two different ones and the service was amazing regardless of location and the food was delicious. They have actual fried chicken here which is always a goal for me, it's a hard thing to find in Vegas. They range from average portions to \"omg I need to take this home\" portions.  They're only open until 8 which is kind of a bummer but personally I feel like it's all worth while.  No grumpy workers, food is on point, clean environment.  That's a win win for me! Their deserts are made daily and constantly changes and so do the specials, I've never tried the specials but the desserts are super yummy! I think the reason I enjoyed this place so much was because it had a small town diner feel to it, and it was super nice to experience that right down the street.  Check this place out if you happen to drive by. Honestly, you won't regret it. :)",

My daughter ordered the breakfast pie and a side of bacon and I ordered meat lovers omelet and a side of bacon and chose the biscuit for me bread. We both got the seasoned potatoes. After opening everything up at home we were shorted one if the sides of bacon.  Both of our eggs tasted so watery I have to believe they either came out of a carton or they use water to add volume to the eggs. Second the hashbrowns....not a speck of seasoning on them..the blandest potatoes I ever tasted. The larger pieces were hard in the middle. Omelet was ok...barely ok...eggs like I said were watery but the fillings were....so so...my daughter ciuldnt eat the breakfast pie....eggs were so watery..mushrooms were soggy. We gave hers to the dogs..they seemed to enjoy it. The biscuit was delicious. That was my favorite part of the meal. Maybe they cater more to dining in....I dont know. But for a $28.40 breakfast or 2 people I wont ever be back. Should have gone to sunrise cafe where i am always happy with what i get. They get the 2nd star because the lady who checked me out was a sweetheart. I was very close to bringing everything back...honestly not worth the wait or the effort.",

If this location were my introduction to the chain, I probably wouldn't return.  First visit, I came in solo. After taking my order, I never saw my server again. There was an error with my order, and the hassle of having to hunt down the staff made me suck it up and eat it anyway. The seasonal pumpkin spice coffee was awesome. But seriously? Service was the total opposite of Tropicana and Rainbow locations.  Second (and last) visit, I interacted with the manager who was just totally unprofessional. I was there about a promo they were running on social media, and apparently this location wasn't participating. He was rude and dismissive. Maybe it was an off day for him. My server was super sweet and attentive, but I won't be back: as a two star Yelp rating indicates, \"Meh. I've experienced better.\"",

I swear as soon as 12pm hit, it became super busy - all tables were filled! The staff were very friendly and had bubbly personalities! I ordered the 'Fried Chicken Plate', includes half a chicken - fried, mashed potatoes with gravy, grilled veggies and a biscuit. Dinner item for lunch, I know weird, but before ordering we kept seeing the chicken pass by and didn't want so much of the breakfast/lunch food, so that was the best bet. Definitely did not disappoint - chicken was super crispy and moist, mashed potatoes were buttery good, the grilled veggies were simple but nothing beats that grilled, charred taste, and those biscuits made from scratch daily, ughh *drool*! Also, had a side of onion rings.   Second visit was during dinner with family, it was SUPER packed! Informed a 15-20 minute wait, which wasn't too bad. Staff was still very friendly though! I decided to try the 'Chicken and Waffles with the Strawberry Butter'. I know I went opposite this time -- breakfast for dinner, lol! Chicken this time around was a bit salty. The waffles were perfectly crisp and that strawberry butter is amazing! Such a unique concoction!  Mom got the steak and eggs. TBH, we've had better - so this was just \"ok\" in our books. Stepdad got chicken fingers with fries. Brother got 'Bold City Burger', which has cheese, onions, bacon, sausage, jalapenos, lettuce, tomato on a brioche bun - this was soooo good! ALOT to take in (literally) but the toasted bun with all the ingredients together takes this burger to the next level! A MUST TRY!  Very pleased with both visits and like I've mentioned before, I LOVE comfort type of foods! Can't wait to try the rest of the menu!",

    "text": "So after reading the rave reviews of how good the food and service Metro Diners are known for throughout the U.S, I was curious to see what was all the fuss about this chain. Honestly, it's just a step up from Denny's. Their menu items offered here is better, ambiance is nicer, but that's just about it.  Came here couple times over the past few months, hoping I'd find something I can be excited about and tried different dishes each time. Nothing memorable to me, well, except pass on the grits here, the texture and taste are off. trust me.  Mr B loves their Monte Cristo. I had liked it too. But that last visit, it was heavy on the grease. The jam that it's served with was good too. I assumed it was made from scratch from what I read. But when I asked our server for more, she looked and pointed to the packaged jellies on our table and said just open those, they're the same thing. Okaay.  Service is friendly. Nothing more or less. It was on point when the servers had their trainers hovering over them. Last two visits, got seated right away, but it took more than five minutes for a server to acknowledge our existence. Plus they were forgetful.   And whoever was the lead giving their employees evaluations, should use a little more discretion. Like do not do the employee evals at the boothes with patrons within earshot. Real tacky.  Employee got rated 3 cause she \"needs to smile more\"... which may be True, but how about how unprofessional evaluator was? I didn't need to hear that.   Metro Diner still on the list to visit, just not as enthusiastic as others are.",

So I came on a holiday and the place was packed. 5 stars for the hostess and wait time. They have water and coffee available while you wait. The front of house was staff had a lot going on, but were very friendly and got us seated rather quickly. The decor of the place 5, its got a retro/cozy/modern diner feel. Something different and all in all it is a unique spot. The menu items all sounded yummy and when the food was brought it looked delicious. I ordered the famous Monte Cristo and gf ordered the Shrimp and grits (we got the heads up that theh are grits were cakes instead of a bowl of grits. Which was appreciated and we knew what to expect when the plate arrived). Both dishes lacked flavor. All I could taste on the Monte Cristo was the grease from the batter it was fried in. The shrimp was good, the sauce it came in was watery. Eating it when its so hot that it burns your mouth the flavor was there, once it cooled down so you could actually eat it the flavor was subpar. We spent more time waiting for our waitress to acknowledge us than we spent eating. Now I know it was busy so I was willing to chalk it up to that, but when she walked by starting at us and just continued on thats when I took it personal. We had 3 other servers assist us throughout the meal that were very friendly even though it was busy. All in all it was an experience. I dont get the hype behind it though.",

    "text": "I'm going to go with just okay for the Stephanie location of Metro Diner.  I vacillated between 2 and 3 stars, but I'm feeling generous.  I gave the W. Trop. location 3 stars as well, but I actually liked that set-up and service there better.    This location was very busy when we stopped by for dinner, so we sat at the counter to avoid the 45-60 minute wait.  Their counter seating is small and a little odd.  It's right next to the expediter, so we got a firsthand look at why they were so backed up.  He seemed truly lost and didn't want to listen to any of his servers who seemed to know more than he did.  I didn't like how rude he was to them.  The kitchen staff was very nice though.  They actually asked us a couple times what we had ordered because they could see how long we were waiting (over 35 minutes) for our food.  I ordered the Chicken Salad on a salad ($10.49).  It was filling, nothing special, but no complaints on flavor.  Everything was premade, so it should have taken less than 5 minutes to come out.  John got the Meatloaf Plate ($12.99 + $3.99) He asked if he could sub a garden salad for the potatoes and baguette.  The waitress said sure, but didn't mention that it would cost more.  It would have been nice to be told in advance that this was a $4 up charge.  Not a lot of money, but it's kind of crappy to add a charge without notice, especially since a garden salad is only 50 cents more than a side of mashed potatoes.    Our waitress was nowhere to be found for the majority of our visit.  I asked the hostess if we had one after about 10 minutes.  A server came over and took our order, but that's the last time we saw her.  We never got iced tea refills and the kitchen staff just handed us our plates over the counter (which we appreciated).  I had to ask the expediter for a copy of our bill so we could pay and leave.  Maybe we'll try again  in a couple months since the location is perfect for us.",

I ended up ordering the stuffing waffle which is basically a waffle made from stuffing that is topped with mashed potatoes and turkey with brown gravy. I decided to order this since it is currently one of their specials. The waffle itself was pretty good in terms of flavor because I was actually able to taste the stuffing. I loved how crispy the waffle was, but unfortunately half of the waffle ended up being soggy because of the moisture and heat from being covered by the mashed potatoes and turkey. I think the dish would have been better if everything was plated separately instead of on a stack. The portion is pretty big and I'd say it's enough for two people. The turkey was pretty dry and didn't have much flavor. I wish I had more gravy for my mashed potatoes because all of the gravy just ended up on the turkey itself. No one likes eating mashed potatoes without gravy right?   Overall the food was decent, but the service was pretty good. The waiter was very personable and kept an eye on our table. I'd probably come back here and try some of their other dishes.",

We expected a wait but must have beat the rush because there were only a handful of people there when we arrived.  Our server while nice, was pretty much non existent.  He said he would give us a minute to look at the menus and then left for over 20 min.  Even when we had our menus stacked on the edge of the table and made eye contact as he passed by he didn't come back.  We watched him check his phone and talk to the host and other employees while we were clearly waiting.  It put a bit of a damper on the visit.  Eventually we were able to order.  We got the Chicken n Waffles, Shrimp n Grits and off the specials board Key Lime Stuffed Waffle.  Food came out quick and tasted great.  A different server took over the remainder of our meal, not sure why no one said anything but she was way better so no complaints.",

The coffee is not done by a barista, but guess what? It's the best cup I've had in a long time. Orange juice was great too, served in a tall glass. Water was filled, coffee was filled, asked if we wanted anything, offered boxes, etc.  The prices were right and the portions were large. We both split the chicken and waffles and a bacon, egg, toast, potatoes, pancake breakfast. Yes, we took a lot home. The waffles were scrumptious, fluffy and light. The strawberry better was delicious. My only slight problem was that the chicken was too salty. I love salt. This was too much. I don't know if it was the batter or the after frying salt. I did eat it anyway because it was so juicy and the inside and nice and crunchy on the outside.  The other breakfast was solid. We will be back!!",

There isn't a long wait, and when they do see you they take your order right away. Not once did I have to ask them for a refill. And that's a big thing for me! My coffee never went empty. The waiter came over often to check on us, he even came over as my friend was talking. One of my friends likes to talk with huge gestures and it looked like he was waving his hand. I appreciate the waiter coming over to check on us even though we didn't ask for him to come over LOL. But that just shows they are always keeping an eye on their tables.    The Excellence doesn't stop at the service. The food is just as delicious as you would expect. It's no wonder this place is packed. My friend had the pound cake French toast and I had a breakfast pie. The breakfast pie was absolutely amazing, it came with a side of hash browns. They serve so much food I was unable to finish my meal, I left full.  I would definitely recommend this place for breakfast. Come hungry!",

I had the Holy Davoli burger....so much food yet so awesome. The burger was cooked perfectly, the plus was the \"lettuce slaw\" put the taste right over the edge. Great location, great food, great price with amazing servers a  very go again diner.",

Tried the hallah bread french toast as an appetizer and once again, amazing, soft deliciousness! Pot roast was great too. I really love the selection on the menu, and want to try the pastrami sandwich, meat loaf and one of their omelets next time.  Service: John A get's and A for service lol! A+ actually! He is super attentive and made great recommendations. Because of him and the amazing food, WE WILL BE BACK!",

In the past, we have totally enjoyed the fish & chips, as the fish has always been so tender and flaky. Our most recent order, however, was a total disappointment. The fish was burnt and totally dried out. If we had been dining in, we would have sent our meals back to the kitchen for replacement. Due to time constraints, driving back to complain was not an option. What disappoints us most is the fact there is no consistency in meal prep. From anything other than a fast food restaurant, we would always expect the quality to be the same time and again, whether eating in or out.",

My Aunt, Uncle, and I arrived around 5:30PM on a Tuesday evening to a good crowd in the dining room but with no wait for a table, a plus. We were seated right next to the kitchen near the wash area which was very noisy when in use, not a deal breaker but definitely annoying.   My family and I ordered the Minorcan Clam Chowder, Chicken Salad Salad, Blackend Chicken fingers, and a ruben. The clam chowder was very strange with a sour slightly spicy flavor (I wasn't a fan but that could be of the chowder style itself, not a reflection on Metro). My family liked their meals but I wasn't fond of the ruben. It had a strange sour flavor that wasn't from the kraut, possibly from the pastrami seasonings and they had munster cheese chunks (despite Swiss described on the menu) that weren't melted. I ate about half and threw in the towel.   It wasn't great, but it wouldn't stop me from returning to try something different...",

    "text": "After seeing a bunch of reviews on my timeline and becoming intrigued by the strawberry butter on their Fried Chicken and Waffles, my boyfriend and I decided it was a sign that it was time to try this establishment after they opened up a new location close to where we live. This restaurant chain has 3 locations across the valley (and according to their website, another one opening soon on Serene and Eastern). It specializes in big portions and comfort food.  Interior: Many tables and booths available. Like the name implies, it looks exactly like any other All-American diner. The decor is very cute and reminds me of all the lunches eaten in the middle of long road trips in small towns along the way to my destination.  Service: Service was pleasant. Our waitress was very nice, knowledgeable of the menu, and very accommodating. Food came out quickly.  Food: Bold City Burger ($12.99): Consisted of Provel cheese, caramelized onions, bacon, sausage, fried jalapenos, and garlic aioli on a brioche bun with a side of fries. My boyfriend ordered this and fell in love with it. The burger was gigantic and a lot more filling than he anticipated. He only finished half of it, and that's saying something considering he's a never-ending vacuum (still love him, though!).  Fried Chicken and Waffles ($15.99): Maybe I don't eat a lot, but this plate can easily feed two people. It comes with 3-4 giant pieces of fried chicken, a whole Belgian waffle sprinkled with powdered sugar on top, strawberry butter, and their signature sweet and spicy sauce (it's basically Louisiana hot sauce and syrup). They really meant it when the menu said it was half a chicken! The chicken was crispy and the breading was not too heavy. The sauce gives a good kick to it and you could add as much (or as little) hot sauce to your mixture as you need. Since the fluffy Belgian waffle already had powdered sugar on it, I was afraid that the strawberry butter would cause it to have a sweetness overload. Thankfully, the flavor of the strawberry butter was subtle.  I had my doubts considering this is a chain restaurant. However, I was pleasantly surprised. I will be returning here soon. This time, with an emptier stomach!",

Me and my girlfriend ate here twice while visiting my grandparents at the end of September, it was great service and great food, 4 or 5 stars is what they rated based off of the regular diner experience but what really impressed me was the kindness they showed in the wake of one of the most tragic nights of our lives. My girlfriend and I were trapped inside the route 91 harvest festival the night of the shooting, we endured a horrifying ordeal while escaping the venue that night, we hardly slept when we arrived at my grandparents house that night but as the dust settled the next day my grandparents took us here for breakfast. I ate maybe 3 bites of my food, my girlfriend maybe double that, through the course of normal waitress conversation and the fact this was world news and we were in the town next to it only 12 hours later the waitress found out what happened, she talked to her manager, she talked to the regional manager I believe it was who just happened to be stopping by. They paid for all of our meals and extended their thoughts to us in this terrible time, they didn't have to do any of that but they did, that's a company that is run by real people unlike many others nowadays. The Polaroid at the bottom of the collage is all of us on our first visit that weekend before the shooting.",

Metro Diner, Henderson, NV -Stephanie Road will be added to my favorite list.  A friendly welcome relief of delicious food and drink, for a solo business traveler seeking comfort.  Plus a great slow atmosphere before speeding into the rest of your day.  Interior photos to be added later. A very unassuming exterior, with delicious delightful food inside.  Similar to the warm and friendly feeling, I've always experienced in Southern USA. (Southern Cuisine)  Something for every palate: Organic choice teas, No-Carb option (egg & turkey sausage), crab egg hollandaise, to sinfully tasty looking waffles & pink ice cream. (didn't try-looked absolutely delicious).  Diner service from host/hostess, waitress, visiting regional manager, and the amazing COOK was phenomenal.

Can't wait to bring my husband here for good eats.  Much appreciation!  Metro Diner, Henderson.NV Stephanie Rd.",

Mine, not so much. I ordered the French Dip and the one I had at the Rainbow location was so good! Of course I order it again at the Stephanie location. I was so disappointed. The food tastes like cardboard. I don't know if the cheese was bad or the horseradish was expired but something was off. Thank goodness my friend's dinner was good because we went there off my recommendation. In the future, I will order one of their signature items instead of the same old staple.",

We each took one bite and threw it away. The broccoli was soggy and drenched in water. The Mac and cheese was the only decent thing. Waste of 40$.",

My husband orders his usual 4 eggs scrambled with cheese, grits, bacon and toast and pancakes. Again he was too full to eat the pancakes so he had a carry out too. Being that we are from the South, we screamed with excitement when we saw that they had grits. They were the best grits we have tasted in LV- they were cooked to perfection with a creamy taste just like back home. We are Metro Diner customers for life.",

All eats were meh; broccoli cheddar soup was just ok and luke warm, actually the biscuit was the best thing I had with butter and strawberry jam on it, coffee was weak but somewhat expected at a little breakfast place like this. I did have some of a hash brown that was accidentally brought instead of the home fries for the gf's dish they were also just eh-- definitely better with pepper and ketchup.  The main reason we came: gf was wanting crabs egg Benedict and to say the least she was disappointed and felt not too good after eating the dish. The hollandaise sauce was definitely broken and made wrong, crab cakes looked dry and she said they had an off taste to them, not bad, just off.   Service was awesome though! From the hostess to the servers to the bus boy. All hard working and very pleasant. When the hash browns came instead of the home fries he did everything to make it right quickly and with a smile on his face. And he was on it with the coffee refills.  We probably won't be coming back but it was worth a try... for crabs eggs Benedict we will stick to Hash House a go go.",

We decided to just get a side order of their chicken since we wanted to get other breakfast items. My friend and I decided to just get 1 drumstick each.  - They charged us $7 for the 2 small drumsticks. - Holy crap, it was near inedible as it was a complete salt bomb.  - My friend commented that they've been really inconsistent with their fried chicken lately.  1st time: It was \"delicious, the best fried chicken I've ever had.\"  2nd time he had it, he said it was \"super bland\", so bland that he had to add salt to it himself.  3rd time/yesterday: We damn near got high blood pressure. All you could taste was the salt.  BREAKFAST CROISSANT ($7):  You can't go wrong with eggs, bacon and cheese. Very generous with the eggs and cheese, it was basically spilling over. What I didn't like was getting only 2 dinky slices of bacon.   CRAB CAKE BENEDICT ($14): Best dish of the day. The two crab cakes were meaty and tasted delicious, the hash brown was crispy and lightly seasoned.   It took over 25 mins for us to get our food. The kitchen just couldn't keep up, you could see the servers all standing around by the window waiting to pick up their food. Our server was great in coming by frequently to update us on our orders, so an extra star for him and his friendly professional attitude. Metro Diner is lucky to have him.",

You pretty much get little to no attention from the servers. We got sat at a table that was still soaking wet from the last person that attempted to clean it. When it came time to getting refills, our server gave us someone else's drinks. Not quite sure how receiving the check here works, but our server placed it on our table as soon as he dropped off our food. I get that this place just opened and they're still trying to figure things out, but just blatantly ignoring guest is unacceptable. We were excited to come here after seeing all the great reviews and recommendations, but I doubt we will be coming back.",

I can understand the wait if it's busy, but this kind of service is unacceptable.

    "text": "UPDATE REGARDING MANAGEMENT-I am updating my review regarding Peter and Tony, the manager partners, who have gone above and beyond to rectify this situation. I truly appreciate their time and care they have shown regarding this situation. They both have reached out personally to ensure they could discuss this experience and I have updated my rating just purely because of the two of them.   Absolute WORST experience EVER. We visited the Rainbow location last year before all the other locations opened and it was great! And we've been to the one on Serene several times and love it!! Don't even waste your time to come to this store. The manager, Lynn, spends her time with two other employees staring at their expo screen confused yet smiling and laughing as they point around trying to figure out the mess of their kitchen while then harassing customers outside the restaurant after we left!  Waited a good 8-10 minutes for our drink order and just put in our food order as well because it took that long for her to come to us, but the waitress was not our issue this visit. We ordered two Philly cheese steaks no onions, a French dip and the \"holy divoli\" burger medium rare. Then waited at least 20 minutes for her to continually tell us \"it's coming don't worry they're a little slammed up there.\" Then we notice her talking to the manager, Lynn, as they are looking at the order screen with one other girl in a pink shirt all looking confused and pointing to the screen several times. Lynn then comes over to us to tell us the kitchen messed up the medium rare burger and over cooked it so \"I'm the Mom and I made the call to just remake everything but it's at the top of the screen it will be right out.\" That sounded kind of nice due to not wanting one person to wait to eat, but we were slightly curious as to how they even knew they over cooked the burger? And my husband isn't picky enough to throw a fit over a slightly over cooked burger if they would have just explained when they brought it out; but we sure threw a fit afterwards. It then took 25 more minutes and our order was still not there! We finally see the burger up there and one of the sandwiches. Wait a few more minutes. Then the one of the sandwiches gets taken to another table!!! Mind you 7 other tables who got there after us got their orders while we were waiting. As soon as that other sandwich got delivered to another table and the burger that started it all continued to sit up there the waitress came over and we said,\"this is just crazy. If that's not our food up there we are just going to leave.\" She just walked away. Three minutes later and still no food nor has Lynn or anyone come by to say anything at all, we got up and left. I turned around to come back and ask for the name of the manager (Lynn didn't have a name tag on and at that time I didn't know her name). She then proceeds to chase me as I walk out the door shouting \"MA'AM MA'AM!\" And then followed me outside harassing me saying, \"I already paid for your food myself and it's fine just come back in and eat it!\" We didn't go there because we couldn't afford our meal! We just wanted to have a nice dinner. The \"B\" food grade on the wall on the way out was another clear indicator we should have just went somewhere else. I have never been so upset by a poor restaurant or service I've received. I've worked in the food industry and completely understand things happen. But Lynn's manager skills and behavior was completely unacceptable. As I got in the car another customer walked out and said, \"I just want to apologize for that restaurant. She was completely out of line.\" Very True. I will be calling their \"manager partner,\" Peter tomorrow morning.",

Place was fairly empty when we got there, maybe 3 other tables.  The manager or whomever calls for the runners has a voice that just carried throughout the place; calling for runners, yelling to 'get to work.'   Just bothered me.   Not a very comfortable feeling sitting there.   Ordered the San Fran Benedict, it was pretty good.  Also, we got the avocado toast with poached eggs on the side.  The sliced tomato was super thinly cut and underneath the avocado 'mash' that was ICE FREAKING COLD.  Pretty unpleasant to say the least.   I would have preferred sliced avocado at room temp.   The coldness was too much.   My little one got the kids pancakes.  I think they were $3.79.  We added chocolate chips.  To my surprise, when the bill came; they were $1.79 extra!    Seems a little steep... I don't think we will be back. Who knows, but I doubt it.  None of us left feeling like anything we had was something we couldn't live without.  Unimpressed to say the least.    Gave 3 stars because the staff were friendly and busting their butts!",

A black and white check tile floor. Diner favorites such as fried chicken, meatloaf, pot pie and burgers. Even some oldies (late 60s and maybe early 70s) playing on the PA. The only thing not part of the throw back feel of Metro Diner is the tablet device the wait staff record your order on; which, to quote the waitress, \"is the worst invention.\" I tend to agree.  Any how, I ordered what is in my mind a trifecta burger. That is to say a bacon, mushroom and swiss burger. I ordered it cooked to medium and it came out as such. The juicy beef tasted fresh. The cheese was melted perfect and gooey. The three slices of bacon were thick cut and came perfectly crisp. The mushrooms were fresh and shroomy. The rest of the toppings were simply shredded lettuce and one slice of tomato. Really it was just a generic burger. But there is nothing wrong with a generic burger if it is done right. The fries on the side were fries. Thick cut and natural with skins on.  Usually I would stop with the burger and fries. But the entire time I was waiting for my food and eating I could not help but stare at the chalk board on the far side of the restaurant. One dessert written on the board was taunting me. Bananas foster cheesecake. Um, yes please. So I ordered dessert today. It was good but not as good as I had hoped it would be. Basically it was a cheese cake with bananas in it. It was like eating banana pudding with the texture of cheesecake. It would have been nice if it reflected a True bananas foster more with a booze flavor. Regardless, it was a good dessert.  The diner was about half full today. Fairly busy I suppose. And the entire wait staff was running around like mad serving everybody at every table. They were friendly and attentive. There is a sign above the bar that reads something along the lines of \"Where the locals eat.\" And there were obvious locals here. The waitress knew a group that came in when I was finishing my cheesecake. She knew them by name and knew their drink orders before they even sat down. This is a good measure of quality customer service. Metro Diner may be a chain but they truly feel like a neighborhood establishment. I'm a fan.",

Food is top notch and all home made, service was spectacular and the owner, Peter, also swung by the table to say hello and make sure we liked everything. Can't think of a single thing bad to say about this place other than they have created an addiction for me because now I have to repeatedly come back to try the other 5 things I wanted to order. We will be back, and if you are reading this, drop your phone and get in the car. No matter where you are coming from, it's worth the trip.",

    "text": "I really enjoyed my lunch experience here.  Especially notable was the friendly and enthusiastic service I received.  They really know how to make you feel welcome.  And the key is that it was genuine friendliness and enthusiasm; they weren't just going through the motions.  I had the avocado veggie wrap which includes fried jalapenos, carrots, spinach, avocado, sour cream, red onions, cheddar cheese, and chipotle ranch dressing.  It came with your choice of side; I had it with french fries that were cooked to my liking, not too crispy and not undercooked either.  The wrap was excellent! The diet coke I had was really good as well.  Sometimes fountain beverages don't have the proper fizz or don't taste right for some other reason, but this was one of the best diet coke's I've had!    The only negative is for me is that I'm a vegetarian and they don't really have any lunch or dinner choices for the vegetarian other than the aforementioned wrap and a grilled cheese sandwich.  I suppose you could also get a spinach salad and either hold or substitute the bacon for something else.  Another option is to get the macaroni and cheese along with some other side dishes such as cole slaw, sauteed veggies, and fresh fruit.  But otherwise I really loved it and look forward to coming back!",

The spicy honey chicken biscuit sounded great but the biscuit flaked apart and got soggy from their honey sauce, there was nothing to it but for $4.99 I left half and didn't bother to complain...my husband left half his meal and that alone spoke words (he rarely leaves food on the plate)! So, not sure why this place has so many positive reviews, but with great competition around the neighborhood - I don't see this place lasting long, then again Denny's is still around (Insert gross face)!",

I wanted the chicken and waffles, but wasn't willing to pay $16.99 for it. I got the philly cheesesteak, which was recommended to me.  Food 4/5. Onion rings were great, big,  crispy, and unsalted. The philly cheesesteak tho... meat was good, it was hot and fresh, provolone cheese melted, grilled onions. I wasn't a fan of the pickled jalapenos. The deal breaker was the untoasted bread. Just a bit sad.  Service 5/5. Fantastic. Quick, welcoming, attentive even as I was the last one for the night.    Overall 4/5 for the price. Metro diner doesn't seem special enough to justify the higher costs.",

The waitress wore bright pink, dangling ball earrings and always greater everyone with a sweet voice and a smile. Meals were delicious, affordable and ended with a piece of Bazooka! Today the Metro empire has grown to all parts of the Valley. That's a good thing...yes, there is a but. As the company has grown the quality of the meals has dropped. The cost of a pizza is now ridiculous!  I'm sad. We? the neighborhoods, have made you. Strip prices are not the way to thank us.",

    "text": "Stellar dining experience last night with my wife at Metro Diner! We were greeted immediately upon entering the restaurant and promptly seated. The restaurant had a positive energy, relaxed feel, and cool retro diner vibe. All the staff, including the management, were very friendly throughout the meal. Kiki our waitress arrived at our table promptly and asked if it was our first time dining with them. We said it was, and she explained the menu to us. She gave us time to review the menu and recorded our order on a tablet computer, instead of the old-school paper and pen method. I was surprised and pleased with the large variety of menu items. The prices were good and the portions exceeded my expectations. Prior to our food arriving we noticed a piece of food on one of our forks that didn't come off in the dishwasher. We were not upset but made sure to inform our waitress, who immediately informed the manager. Not sure if he was the store owner or manager, but he promptly stopped by our table and apologized, giving us two $5 off coupons to the restaurant. The manager was very congenial and chatted with us about our families for about five minutes...very cool guy! Kiki did a great job attending to us during the meal. The food was excellent and arrived at an appropriate temperature. Payment for the meal was done via debit card on the tablet computer, allowing for TIP addition. As we left the restaurant we were thanked by at least three Metro Diner staff and one of them held the door open for us as we left. VERY impressed with this restaurant...will definitely be back!",

    "text": "I'm very fond of diner food and this place had its good points and areas they can improve.   We were greeted right away and were given the option of seating. Our waitress arrived and took our drink orders and told us about the specials.   My Mother opted for breakfast and I had the fried chicken. The food arrived very quickly. Presentation could have been much better. Both of our meals were on plates too small for the amount of food offered. It made the plate look crowded and a bit unappetizing. My chicken came with potatoes, veggies and a biscuit. The chicken was well cooked, potatoes were good and the biscuit was ON POINT. The veggies we're swimming in grease/oil and completely inedible.   The service was good and friendly. There seemed to be a push for upgrades, soup, cheese on potatoes. Not necessarily the waitresses fault; I'm sure that at the direction of management.   I'll be back and try something else.",

My fiancee ordered the corned beef hash and that too way so good! Usually we shy away from ordering hash because it's too dry and gross. Not the case with metro diner!!! Customer service was good but only thing that bothered us was it seemed like our server was faking being nice too much. Nothing wrong with that but being genuine would be a lot better. Will definitely go eat here again though!!! Glad this opened up next to our house",

Regarding the food, I had avocado toast, which was basically guacamole spread on top of 4 slices of bread. They may need to work on the presentation.

Out of the 2 specials they were having she recommended the pulled pork waffles. I know, weird combo, but definitely delicious! Man, I wish they had one of these in Cali!

Very cool menu with traditional diner items and some interesting twist and innovative choices as well. Only complaint is that it's very loud/noisy (which I guess is to be expected in a busy diner) and the prices are about $2-$4 dollars too high on everything.  We ordered 2 eggs Benedict, coffee and a short stack and our bill was $50 with tip. That's a bit steep for breakfast for two. I'd definitely go back but on rare occasions due solely to the cost.",

We ordered chicken and waffles it came with strawberry butter that was so delicious I could have eaten it all alone ...another nice touch was the server brought hot sauce and syrup and mixed it at the table for a sweet and spicy sauce for the chicken. YUMMY!  When the order arrived it was plated beautiful and we couldn't wait to indulge!  The chicken was great,  tender inside, crispy outside and flavorful ..as a side note I thought there could have been a bit less salt but that's a personal preference and others may not feel the same, it was still good .. the Belgian waffle was perfect and the strawberry butter was an added treat that definitely kicked up the overall experience.  We also ordered the omelet with hash browns, biscuit and sausage gravy - everything tasted great as a matter of preference I would have liked for the meats to have been cooked in a bit with the omelet for more of an infused flavor --- it was prepared like the omelet was cooked fully and then meats and cheese added after .. so it was more like eating the fillings and then eggs - needless to say was still good.. the hash browns were perfect and the sausage gravy was good ..a bit mild I personally would have liked a more flavor from the sausage but again it was still good, had good consistency not too thin and not too thick and the biscuit was great! Buttery and fluffy it didn't need anything was great all by itself.  It was a nice touch that the owner Peter personally visited our table to check in on everything he was super awesome! The atmosphere was great, staff was great, restaurant and bathrooms were clean. There was a nice variety of menu options and had I the time I would have went back for lunch because I saw so many things I would have loved to try! It was a great experience and when I'm in Vegas again I will be stopping in again!",

My wife enjoyed her dinner as well, but I forgot what she had. I did notice something very cool while we were there: Someone had placed a HUGE to go order, like 15 dinners. As he was bagging them up, the manager opened each clamshell to check it for accuracy and even sent one back to be fixed. I love that attention to detail.",

We sent the club back as it had plastic on it, they never removed it from the cheese. Went with a burger instead and it was wasn't bad. A nice choice when you are looking for a basic meal, no thrills just diner-esque food.

The grandson (15) even commented on how nice everyone was.  My grandson got chicken and waffles and said the chicken tasted like his other grandma makes. Btw he really loves her chicken. He liked the waffle more than his other waffle place, which really surprized me.  I tasted the clam chowder after ordering the porato soup. Darn it if the spicy Manhattan clam chowder (really not a fan) wasn't fantastic. Don't get me wrong the potato soup was really good, it just didn't have the pop of that clam chowder.  We will be back in the near future.",

    "text": "I've seen Metro Diners around the valley, but I have never dined at one before. When I saw that there was going to be one down the street from me, I knew that this was going to be a good. Diners are my kind of thing. Breakfast all day!/  I've had this place bookmarked ever since I found out they have chicken and waffles. I FREAKIN' LOVE CHICKEN AND WAFFLES. Growing up in close proximity to a Roscoe's (Long Beach, waddup!) has altered my idea of chicken and waffles for life-- let's just say that the bar is set pretty high.   Metro Diner's chicken and waffles were top notch. I wouldn't say that they are my all time favorite, but the fried chicken was damn good. The skin was light and crispy, just the way I like it. The waffles were good. I enjoyed the strawberry butter on top, it was a nice addition to a classic combination. The server offered to make me a spicy sauce for my chicken (how am I supposed to say no to that, I love me some spicy!). She came back with a small saucer and poured in Louisiana hot sauce and maple syrup. I had my doubts but wow what a great combination for the fried chicken. The chicken and waffles meal is about $15 and is a decent enough portion to share. Our table also ordered the pot roast dinner. It was a little on the salty side, but I thought it was tender and juicy and went well with the hefty portion of mashed potatoes.  Overall, I was pleased with my experience at Metro and I'll be back again. The table next to us ordered the cobbler and that was enough to convince me to come back even if it was just for dessert. The service was friendly and it really did feel like a neighborhood diner. Metro Diner is a great addition to Stephanie Street. I'll be back again for breakfast!",

We were greeted immediately and drink orders were taken. The food we ordered came hot and fresh and everything that everyone had was delicious and cooked as requested. Our server was attentive, friendly and very good. I believe her name was Rianna or something along those lines. Either way she was amazing. In talking to get her she said things have slowed down. I am not sure if it is the location or what but this is easily one of the better breakfast in Henderson. The prices are par as anywhere else with nice size portions. I will definitely be back to try lunch and dinner too as many of the lunch plates we saw looked amazing. Take my advice and bring the family down and have a nice \"home cooked\" breakfast with friendly service at fair prices.  *Side note to owner - lower the price on sides or increase amount given. $4.29 for a side of bacon with 3 medium pieces isn't fair to patron. This could help get butts in the seats. Want this place to succeed.",

The biscuits were so crispy on the edges and soft on the inside (my fav) and the gravy had a good taste. Portions are very generous. I barely touched my potatoes, only had an egg, and maybe 2/4 of the biscuits. It was a lot and I was so stuffed. I was also able to try the strawberry butter (extra charge) with toast and butter and damn that was gooood.   Large portions, cheap prices, good service.. what more can you ask for?",

The interior and decor fits the old school diner sthick quite well. Kudos for that but I came here to grub so onto the eats. They have quite a large selection to choose from and bless their heart and my taste buds, they serve breakfast and lunch items all day. The time I went was later afternoon and i was famished so I opted for the special which i believe was called the Texas burger. All of their burgers are 1/2 pounders and it came with fries. The burger was pretty tasty as were my fries, my waitress was really kind and made the rounds rather quickly. Even though i have only made one trip here, I am hoping to return to try one of their staple meals. They made a good first impression on me so hopefully it will stay that way.",

During breakfast, we waited for an extended amount of time for our drinks.. having to ask multiple times for our hot tea and encountered wrong food orders being brought to our table and missing items. The second attempt for lunch was much better. Today we also dined in for lunch. I ordered the chicken salad, which was flavored decently, however I encountered a grisly piece which ended that meal. My husband and daughter both ordered chicken fingers which came over cooked and were hard. The service again was decent, drink refills were brought by without being prompted, it still felt as though our waitress was rushed, perhaps too many tables?!

I have been here several times and ordered several of the hamburgers.  They have all been excellent.  Prices on the various burgers vary from $9.99 to $12.99 and this is the general range for most of the breakfast lunch and dinner entrees (breakfast served any time).  The burgers are a half pound  and they are GOOD QUALITY MEAT.  They are not greasy messes (which causes the buns to become soggy).  They come with a wide assortment of sides from fries to mac and cheese to fresh fruit and several other items.  This is a far better burger than some of the big name burger joints on the strip that are twice as expensive.  Haven't tried breakfast yet, but I look forward to it!

    "text": "Okay so i took my son for his 9th birthday breakfast on Saturday February 24th. We were very disappointed in the food. The place was busy but there was no wait for a table the entire time we were there so it wasn't that busy. My sons hash browns were way over cooked and his toast was burnt, i gave him my hashbrowns cause they were okay. My eggs were not over hard they were slimy on one side and my toast was dry as hell with no butter at all. I asked for butter and after waiting for quite awhile i got totally burnt toast. I asked again for new toast and as we were about to leave i got one piece of okay toast. I was excited to bring my son for his bday breakfast but we were both very disappointed by the crap coming out of the kitchen. Also it seems like the old waitresses don't understand the pads they use to take your order. Unfortunately we will not be back and will go back to our regular breakfast spots, this time was horrible and will keep us away for good.....",

I very much appreciate Metro's decor, which harkens back to the original diners. enjoyed the chicken-fried steak and the hash. I wouldn't get the pot pie again, as they use rolled-out biscuit dough as crust. The best crust (and a flaky one) for pot pies is James Beard's recipe, which uses egg yolks as an enrichment. There will be plenty left over to take home. The waitpersons are trippy and very helpful. One day I asked for mashed potatoes....and they didn't have any...is that unforgivable for a diner? Stuck with fries again. I will definitely be trying their stuffing waffles sometime soon. We'll be getting a Metro Diner on Serene at Eastern (near WalMart and Home Depot), which will attract a lot of people down off the hill.",

The mashed potatoes were creamy and delicious. I got the Cajun chicken pasta which was one of their specials but it wasn't that great. It came out and the sauce looked thick and gritty which was exactly the texture I got. The flavor was ok but it was quite salty. I would certainly go back again but obviously I'm not getting the same thing.",

In Utah there's a place called the Italian place that is a hundred times better and you can get a huge sandwich for $10 and share it and not have to tip a server. I got the pastrami sandwich that had an egg on it and cheese and coleslaw. I didn't realize that it had Fry's on it too. I'm sorry but it just wasn't very good .  The bread was not toasted at all. It was these big slices of bread with all this stuff on it so it was really hard to eat. The Fry's that were on the sandwich were squished soggy and cold. The egg on the sandwich was cold . It did lot of meat on it though, but it has this really strong flavor like it it's been brining forever. I didn't get any mustard for the pastrami and the waitress didn't even ask me if I wanted any. Who eats pastrami without mustard ? Then my husband realized that he's lost his wallet and we had to leave. The waitress brought us our containers to put our food in and then I went up front because we were in a hurry and I didn't want to have to wait for her to get my credit card. She finally came up there and ran my card then left me standing there with the paperwork that I had signed and I had to wait for someone to come back up there to get it. So I tipped her $1 less then I was going to. I mean if she is going to leave me standing there when she knew I had an emergency then tough luck your not getting much of a tip from me. Seriously people if Guy Fieri's going to endorse your restaurant and live up to it!",

Usually I can only eat 1/2. Tonight I had to put all of the scrawny meat on one half. It was salty as heck and when I left I felt nauseous. I hope I don't puke later!! I will stay away for a while. I hate when a new place opens up and is amazing, then slowly goes down the toilet.",

The place only had three tables at dinner -again only open recently but in a Very busy shopping center-also a known name. Well the service was okay but they had three servers and at least four cooks on, Saying this as there was plenty of staff to wow anyone! I had the Special Stuffing Waffle which was good but the \"Roasted\" Turkey was sliced deli meat and the potatoes while being made fresh were bland and the gravy was from a can for sure.My wife's sandwich and soup combo - white bread was hard -not toasted-hard and her soup was putty! yes we could literally stand a spoon in it foe indefinite amounts of time. The manager she duid the right thing by offering to replace it. My wife is refused and she actually took it of the check so kusod to that. In Las Vegas you have to be on your game all the time. We are a food town and okay isn't okay you should have great food!",

Monday morning around 9:30 i came in for the first time to try the diner out. Surprised with how cozy the atmosphere was and there was also a number of people inside. I decided to sit at the bar/counter and here's where it almost went bad. I sat there for a good 5/6 minutes and no one had came over for a drink order or said welcome or anything. Luckily the kitchen staff alerted the manager who was working to get orders out to tables that I needed my order taken. She IMMEDIATELY came over and apologized, asked what I wanted, and she said that it would be right out. She must've pushed my order ahead or something cause it came out in like 2 minutes. I ordered buttered white toast, eggs over easy (perfectly cooked), and biscuits and gravy. Food was really good, nothing that wow'd me but i ordered biscuits and gravy so that's expected.   All in all. The metro diner is a cozy little diner with staff who have attention to detail and want to make sure you have a quality visit. They even held the door open for me on my way out. Hope that helps you out!!",

We've been everywhere and have tried burgers from many well known restaurants, so for him to say that this burger was amazing is a big deal.  We are definitely coming back and bringing the whole family next time. I'm excited to try more items on the menu.  I give this place two thumbs up!",

We were greeted warmly, seated promptly and our waitress was so joyful. She welcomed us as first timers, explained the specials and gave us recommendations.  I wanted to try the Yohala but I also wanted... breakfast (I need savory and sweet). Without me asking she offered to try and sub a half order of the Yohala for my pancake for a buck. SCORE! My husband had the fried chicken and waffles. Our waitress mixed the sweet and spicy sauce (maple syrup and hot sauce) for his chicken and the strawberry butter that came with the waffles was delicious!  Everything tasted SO GOOD. I wasn't sure what quality the food would be but it was far and above any other 'diner' I've been to. I took the bananas out of the Yohala and it was perfect. My husband said his meal was better than Roscoe's.  We will definitely visit again on our next trip to Nevada.",

The reviews for this place looked positive and it was close so we decided to give it a try. Walking in, it just smelled amazing. A positive right off the bat. There was no wait which was another plus even though the place seemed pretty busy. We were seated quickly and our waiter Andy greeted us quickly with water already in hand. We ordered and our food was quick to come out. It was delicious. The portions were huge and it tasted great. Andy was efficient and nice which made the experience as a whole very nice. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a good place for breakfast. And another plus, they serve breakfast, lunch and dinner all day! Give this place a try!",

This place was delicious. Clean, with a lot of help. Our server was John A and he was very nice and knowledgeable about the menu. Definitely seemed as though he had tried everything and was speaking from experience.   I ordered one of their blackboard specials, a stuffing waffle covered in mashed potatoes, turkey, and gravy. It was really good and humongous. My wife had the Monte cristo, which was deep fried and delicious.   I don't think I've been to a restaurant with such happy and nice staff before. They were all going over the top to make sure we were doing well. It was almost a little too much for my taste, but I can't fault them for that.    It's a solid place. You can tell they care. The menu is inventive. I would definitely go back.   Also, I would say it is very family friendly as well. We didn't have our 2 year old son with us, but it was absolutely a place I would feel comfortable with him.",

You barely get see your waiter at all after they serve your drink and your order. They've only come by 4 times and it was only for my drink and order. I would at least suspect them to come back and check up on you once in a while to ask how is your order or if you needed anything else. Especially today, I ordered a side of corn beef hash with my croissant and the corn beef hash smelled and tasted completely spoiled. I had stopped eating right after the first bite and had lost my appetite. After a while, I began feeling sick to my stomach. On behalf of that, the orders I've had is decent and the place is a good setting for a big family. Overall, this diner isn't really all that amazing and great as people say it is.",

We were immediately greeted before the door fully closed behind us! Our waitress was very informative and helpful. She knew we hadn't been before and the choices she recommended were perfect! When I tell you our food was the best breakfast we've had here in Vegas, I truly mean that! Hands down the best! Aside from the food being so delicious, We didn't even have to ask our waitress for refills on our drinks, she was on it! My family and I were extremely happy and impressed to see the owner walking around and mingling with the guests. He came to our table, introduced himself, made time to get to know a little about us and have a chat. You don't see that much anymore so that was a huge thing for us! The entire experience was excellent and we will definitely be coming back, probably every weekend :) Thank you Metro Diner!!",

We first walked in and were sat immediately, the diner was very busy and cleanly.. they have a open kitchen so you can watch staff make the entrees! The staff were nice but a little to attentive.. they literally came by about 8 times with in 20 mins I mean I appreciate it I really do but at least give me sometime to actually try to enjoy my food, also after placing our entrees down we literally received the bill 5 mins later -guess I didn't want to try dessert. The hazelnut coffee was unfortunately not on point it was very bland and watery. I ordered the western omelette and the presentation was nice the hash browns were delicious just the right amount of soft and crunch your looking for and the (egg) omelette itself was very fluffy and delicious .. but when cutting in to the omelette a bunch of liquid poured out I assume water from the soggy onions and tomatoes, the cubes of ham inside must have trapped the moisture??? The English muffin was good except for one side was a little burnt! I will have to give 1 more try, maybe when there not super busy!",

I'd rather pay a bit more for food and service that's good than discounted mediocrity.  Maybe that's just me.  Kyle helped us, he was very personal and anticipated everything we might need.  I had chicken & waffles and was not disappointed.  Husband had the protein breakfast and was just as happy.  Manager/Owner Peter came by and introduced himself.  We will be returning.",

I don't hate it but I don't love it either.    the service - maybe a little too attentive.  Please stop asking me if I'm ok every 5 minutes.  I haven't even tasted the food yet (clearly) and yet you ask if it's good.  Hmmm... Makes it feel a little forced and canned BUT it is better than being ignored.  the menu - great menu choices and specials.  I only wish my powers of observation were better as I may have ordered something that was on the special board (to my back).    the food - ok the food isn't bad it just wasn't like oh yum.  I really really liked the hash browns.  Perfectly crisp but soft inside and not oily at all.  But the benedict I got... let's say I would never order this again but eggs benedict is one of my death row items.  The hollandaise was broken and sooo salty and the avocado was hard as a rock.  If they aren't ripe just tell me and I'll order something else.  I also did not like the hazelnut coffee.  If I were you, I'd come in to give it a try because there is great potential here.  Until next time Metro!",

We have read the reviews and they are all positive with glowing write ups about the food and service. We decided to order the green eggs and ham special in honor of Dr Seuss. It was on special, written on their chalkboard on the back wall of the restaurant. We split it because the servings are large--they feed you here! Our waiter asked if we preferred our scrambled eggs to be soft or medium? We chose soft. The scrambled eggs had fresh spinach and small cubes of ham folded in with crispy hash browns.  It was a good size serving, served hot and fresh. The eggs were topped with feta cheese crumbles. It definitely didn't need any salt! It was a little too salty for both of us. The coffee was okay. I tried the chocolate coffee and my husband chose regular. I think this diner is a little pricey. We can say we tried it and the service was friendly but not my type of place to go for dining out.",

I don't know how long it has been there, but I didn't notice it until I was looking for it.  It is located just north of American Pacific on Stephanie.  The parking can be difficult if you are trying to get in on a Saturday morning; park in the lot just north of it.  Other times, like lunch or a weekday dinner, are quick and easy.  So, classic eggs beny is delightful.  Husband was satisfied with the Monte Cristo.  It was the right mix of meat to cheese and fried.  Been back a couple of times for other options and brought new fans with me.  The San Fran beny got high marks, as did the meat loaf.  We only have the chicken and waffles left to try.  Solid breakfast/lunch place with friendly staff.",

The menu is rampant with delicious options and the staff knows it's going to be tough deciding which to choose so they allow you some time to decide. I like having the quite to to mull over the options. With perfect timing they return asking \"have you decided?\"...and what can they get for you?   I ordered the 3 eggs breakfast with bacon, hashbrowns and sourdough toast with a short stack of pancakes. Expectations are set. Based on the star rating and number to reviews I just knew it was going to be special.   There were two in the short stack. A bit of a chew for my taste; not what I was hoping but good. I wanted it to be amazing.   The eggs were over medium but the heat too high as the edges were hard and golden. Hazards of a line cook managing multiple orders. I get it but I can't give high praise. Bacon was just standard bacon and thin.   Service was okay. No check up for satisfaction or coffee refill offer. I actually wanted to order a milk to go with the short stack but...  Not bad but was hoping and expecting more. I love to tip but I'm actually going to have to do math on this one so not to mislead the wait team.   All the best!",

Upon arrival our server was amazing, she was more than friendly and made us their special sweet and spicy sauce for the Fried Chicken Plate which was to die for! I do say though that the biscuit was pretty, but wasn't too tasty... very chewy.   We also ordered the Turkey Pot Pie. When it arrived I already noticed that the crust looked INCREDIBLY unappetizing. It was very doughy and seemed \"rushed\" which I will put to my late arrival. I just took the crust off and ate the goodness inside and was still pleasantly surprised.

Subtle layers of flavor. The steak was cooked well and the coffee (hazelnut) was brewed in house!  Not that syrup thing that Starbucks puts in. I thought I didn't like hazelnut coffee. I was wrong. I loved it.  What really drives this place to the top is the server. John A. He was attentive, gregarious, and funny. Actually everyone in the restaurant was friendly and thanked us for coming in. It's really one of those places that reminds me of how restaurants used to be. I felt like they actually cared if I enjoyed not only the food but the experience too.   Bonus points: playing Backstreet Boys as I'm writing this review. Good taste in music.",

    "text": "I was referred to Metro Diner by my cousin and diners, drive-ins, and dives. They seem to know what they're talking about. As soon as I walked in I was greeted with a smile and sat immediately at the counter. The counter seats look directly into the kitchen, and I really liked that I could watch the food being cooked and listen to the interactions between the servers and the kitchen staff. The kitchen staff even greeted me and interacted with me throughout my visit there, which I personally enjoy because it really makes me feel welcome. Service and comfort are the biggest things to me when it comes to rating and reviews, and this place nailed both categories.  The food was just as good! I had the challa french toast breakfast special, which came with eggs, bacon, has browns, french toast, and an English muffin. If I had eaten anything at all today, I would probably not have been able to finish it all. The French toast was delicious and the fruit on top of it added some good sweetness and tart to balance it out (bananas and strawberries). The bacon was perfect and the eggs were cooked just right. The hash browns were well done and a little too crispy for me, but this being my first time it was a learning experience. I'm sure if I ordered them differently they would have nailed it. Absolutely wonderful.  Overall, between the great service, friendly interactions, and delicious food, this place got an easy 5 star from me. I'll be back for sure and it will be an easy recommendation to make for friends/family looking for a good breakfast here in henderson.",

Long story short, I got home and had high hopes for the pasta, but it unfortunately fell short. The cheese topping was definitely shredded/grated cheese (the same one that's on salads, I believe it was cheddar cheese). Also the food was already cold when I took it back which was disappointing! Overall I felt like I was eating one of those microwavable pasta dinners and was disappointed.  For the price (Paid around $14~, can't remember), I definitely expected better. I wish I could give a higher rating for this place since I've seen reviews complimenting their service and food, so I'm not sure if I just picked up an order on an off day.",

I drove by this location while I was in town for work and didn't think it was affiliated but I decided to try anyway! I was surprised to find out they had 52 locations, mostly in the South but 2 of which are in the Vegas area. I had the buscuits and gravy in Jacksonville and it was delicious! I tried the Spicy chicken biscuit and a short stack of strawberry pancakes at this location. The pancakes are awesome! The buscuit was also yummy but not spicy at all, kinda tangy sweet. The 3 girls working (8:30am on 10/17/18) were very hospitable, including my server, she was great! I'll definitely be back next time I'm in town.",

    "text": "My son has raved about this place for well over a year.  Today my husband wanted to eat after hanging out at Sunset Station.  Metro showed up on  my Yelp search so we decided to try it out. We got there around 2:30 ish and we were seated right away because the place was empty.    I went to the restroom as soon as we got in and my husband looked at the menu. When I came back a blond server asked us if we wanted anything other than waters to drink.  I hadn't had any time to figure out what I wanted so I said not now.    A different server came later to take our order.  My husband was very sure of what he wanted.  I was still on the fence so I said the Monte Cristo mainly because I've eaten this before elsewhere.  She asked if fries were okay and I asked what other options I had.  She mentioned soup and salad and that made me take a second look at the menu.  I change my mind and ordered the Greek with shrimp.    For whatever reason, the server seemed annoyed.  She just started to walk away and I stopped her to ask if it would already have the dressing on the salad.  She literally rolled her eyes and wouldn't look at me to reply.    Amazingly, she had an employee of the month t-shirt on.  I hope this was a joke because this person is not a good representative of this restaurant.  She chose to sit down and play with a baby instead of returning to serve us during the remainder of our meal.  The blond server returned and gave us our food and check.  She was cordial and did her job well but I was over it by the time she arrived with our food.  There was zero explanation as to the reasons why the service changed and there is zero excuse for sassy attitudes from a server.  I didn't give her an attitude so she certainly didn't need to give me one.  There were literally only two other tables with customers in the restaurant and one of them appeared to be an employee.    I wanted to make this particular server and management aware that the customers aren't blind.  My husband and I both saw her roll her eyes and act snotty.  Good job, \"Employee Of The Month\"!   The salad was actually pretty good with large pieces of shrimp but the attitude was too nasty to come back.",

I was skeptical driving by but it's defiantly worth the stop. The food was out literally 2 minutes after we ordered it, it was flavorful and the service was 5 stars. Servers that stop by every two seconds grate on my nerves but the severs here we polite on time and most importantly came around with coffee refills every five minutes. My kids enjoyed it, we enjoyed it. We will definitely be back   Cons..only down size is the ac. It was super chilling..SUPER CHILLIEST..Im not sure if that's a con being that it's vegas and it 110 degrees outside but the kids where cold. Definitely a 5 star  dinner",

    "text": "Wowee -- excellent meal and excellent overall experience. Would definitely come back.  It's warm, cozy and casual, with lots of comfort food:  the epitome of a diner.    We were first blown away by how fast our food arrived.  It couldn't have been more then 5 min, after we ordered, and here comes Fairlight (yes, that's her name) with our food.   Couldn't believe my husband's huge meal of 2 LARGE biscuits with sausage gravy, eggs with cheese, with a very generous portion of hash browns; all for only $11.99.  For myself, I had an excellent meal of their meatloaf, mashed potatoes with gravy, and caramelized squash slices, priced at $12.99.    As we are from Los Angeles, visiting the Las Vegas area, we are used to very good restaurant food, but not for such portions, and at such reasonable prices   In addition, I ordered 2 pieces of deep fried chicken drumsticks.  Metro is apparently known for their fried chicken and waffles, so I wanted to try their fried chicken, but not their waffles and syrup that comes with it.  The fried chicken was quite good; moist and tender.  Was it the very best I've ever had -- in all honesty, I'm not sure I can say that.  Still it was excellent.  Fairlight's service was exceptional.  My husband said \"she's way too cheerful\".  I absolutely disagree; the world needs more people who are \"too cheerful\".  In this time of world turmoil, we need people who are cheerful and happy around us.  We all have had too much doom and gloom as it is.  I took the opportunity of speaking to the owner, Peter, congratulating him on his restaurant, and Fairlight's excellent service. He's the owner (Managing Partner?) of this particular Metro location.  Peter told me that Metro was a small chain of 12 restaurants, until 3 years ago, when they were purchased by the owner of Outback. Actually, in later looking it up, Outback purchased 100% of Metro's intellectual property.  Now Metro boasts 84 locations.    Will Metro ever open a location in Los Angeles?  Per Peter, this is not likely, due to the costs of doing business in Los Angeles.   Darn.  So, I guess we have to wait for the next time we come to the Las Vegas area to enjoy Metro's excellent food and service.",

A whole lot of goodness packed into a skillet! This is enough to share.  I did let our server know and she comped us a discount. I really appreciate her attentiveness and professionalism in this matter.  She was also very friendly and responsive.  The coffee was decent too. Plenty of parking.",

Food   Drink - Coffee.    Breakfast - I like trying to something that is unique.  The cinnamon swirl pancakes caught my eye.  Visually the pancakes had the classic swirl that you want.  The pancakes were not overly sweet which I appreciated and enjoyed.  I order two sausage patties as an additional item as I needed some morning protein to get me going.

Sometimes I like a bougie experience and other times I just want a quick turn and burn type of place as long as their food is delicious.  So, I just had a really good experience at Metro Diner, which is the epitome of a neighborhood diner.  All the servers were super friendly and efficient and touched the table quite a few times to make sure I had everything I needed.  I ordered a super basic 2 egg breakfast but they got all my requests right - I like my bacon extra crispy and my hash browns soft, egg whites instead of regular eggs - and they got it spot on.  Food came out fast and all the servers made you feel as if you're a regular even though this was my first time here.  Overall an exceptional experience here and I'm looking forward to being back.

There were available seats, seated quickly, ample time to look at the menu, which thankfully wasn't full with 1,000 choices.   Food came nice and warm right off the grill. You can see the cooks making it and calling the orders for the waitresses to come. The food itself was delicious, not overly salty, tasted fresh, and the portion were very generous.   Price point is great as well, not crazy expensive, I think our average was about $10-$12 per plate and we had a party of 5. Like I stated earlier the portions are generous so if your very hungry it's worth it, and if your full you can pack up what you didn't eat to go. Either way it's a win.   Waitresses came by frequently to check on us, offered refills, busboy took away our empty plates quickly. Manager checked on us as well.   Overall, the experience was excellent and we will definitely lbe coming back to eat here.",

The waffle was fluffy and perfectly cooked?  The fried chicken was excellent, crispy, and not too greasy.  The server added hot sauce to a cup of syrup.  That was the perfect complement.   I will now add hot sauce to syrup for fried chicken.    I highly recommend the Metro Diner.  I will definitely come back.",

This place is Clean, Service is quick even though it was crowded, the Waiters, Hostesses and Staff was so Friendly and Professional. We all ordered different food items and each meal was delicious, I recommend the Chicken and Waffles, with Chicken Biscuit on the side and Peach sweet tea. The Manager was very nice professional and welcoming more restaurants should have people like her and that staff. Thank you Metro Diner.",

She had the chicken and waffles and I had an omelette special (bacon, cheese and mushrooms.  I particularly liked the options on the hash browns and I had the onions which were almost a plentiful as the potatoes.  The chicken and waffles were quite good.  However, my wife stripped off the breading on the chicken and did not use the strawberry topping for the waffles.  I ate some of the breading (quite good!) and had the strawberry topping on my toast (also quite good).  Coffee was decent and they have Dickinson jellies (a plus). However, the best part of the meal was Jennifer, our server, who treated my wife like an old friend.  I was in the restaurant business for more than a few years and I wish I could have staffed my entire restaurant with Jennifer's.  In closing, I know this is a chain, but it seemed more like a one of a kind experience.  We'll be back!",

We had so much fun, we did have to wait for a few minutes but that was not Metros fault, it was all our buddies straggling in. There was 6 of us. We were seated and her came our server, Laura M. what a kick, friendly and very knowledgeable and very professional. We never disclosed the fact we were all old time waitresses. We just waited to see how we were treated, normally a bunch of women are not the best tippers.Our food was fabulous, a couple of ladies had salads, One had Chicken, a couple had breakfast and one had a cheeseburger. Hot and yummy. Our server Laura interacted with us even though quite busy.  Glad youre here Metro..Dynamite.  Our 3rd trip in was another mixed group, they all liked it and will be back, unfortunately didnt get her name this time, but service was great and a very sociable server also. I think her name was Wanda. It shoukld be noted my Brother and his wife have also been here numerous times also..And we will all be back.. Congratulations fine and fun Diner.",

    "text": "This was my first time at Metro Diner. I wanted something for brunch time that was close to the Galleria mall (my next destination). It was Saturday around 11am. There was ample parking in front and in the back of the building. There was a 20-25 min wait, but it ended up being less than that. There were many people on staff and everyone who helped us from taking our order to clearing plates was friendly and timely. The menu had a lot of options and I already have some ideas for when I come back! The food was delicious! We got the fruity waffle and breakfast burger for 10 and 14 dollars. And I will say, the food wasn't just good, it was a step up from your typical breakfast place. It was very good. Although I could have stood some more bacon on the burger. I also saw a lot of salad options going by and they all looked incredible. Overall very satisfied with the experience.   Part 2: I came back the following weekend because my first experience was so good. I was expecting it to be another great experience, but this time it was out of this world! I'm blown away. We ordered chicken and waffles and the bold city burger. Let me tell you, best burger, ever (added avocado). Greatest chicken and waffles ever (tied with Hash House for best dish) except Metro Diner has STRAWBERRY BUTTER! The waffles at Metro are the lightest most amazing waffles ever and I found a piece of real strawberry in my strawberry butter! I can't even express how delicious this meal was (we half/half both dishes via plate swapping) Even the very last bite of the burger had ALL THE TOPPINGS on it. That never happens. John, our server was hilarious and attentive. Never missed a beat. And have I mentioned the music? Everything about this place is superb. Go there. Now!",

I mentioned it to the server who intern told the manager. She took care of the dish but I didn't have time for them to remake it. I'm probably going to give this location one more more shot just bc of the location. I hope it was just a fluke :(",

    "text": "The pictures definitely sold me on trying Metro Diner however i wasn't really impressed after dining here. I ordered one of the special items on the board which was Blueberry Cheesecake Belgian Waffle which was nothing special. I was expecting something rich but the \"cheesecake\" portion was tasteless and cold. It was basically a ball of something similar to cool whip but not and frozen blueberries. Then all topped with blueberry compote which is the only part along with the waffle itself that i ended up eating.   Service wise our waitress was lovely but she had half the restaurant and was constantly interrupted by other guests trying to get her attention while she was waiting on us. It was also not helpful when we needed butter, it was almost impossible to make eye contact with anyone. Overall I unfortunately would not dine her again.",

Unfortunately the service didn't match the food. We were seated and quickly had our drinks. Then nothing. After too many minutes I went to the hostess station to try and find our server. He came and took our order and the food came out in a reasonable time period. Then, again, nothing. The server finally walked by and I had to call out to him to get a refill on my ice tea. It also took an extraordinarily long time to get our check.  We were disappointed in the service, especially from a server with the word 'TRAINER' on his shirt. He needs to learn to stop talking with the other servers and pay attention to his customers",

Our Grandson, Chase (an active Marine based in Camp Pendleton) and his girlfriend Denae had been at the Festival the night previous.  We had picked them up during the melee along with others on Tropicana Ave.  It had been a horrible night for all of us and we had stopped for a quick breakfast before going to the Lexus Hotel to recover belongings and for them to return home. We had previously dined here and loved it.  However, after dining on a super wonderful meal we asked our Server Patience for the check.  The onsite manager, Hanna, informed us their was not charge and they would take care of the check.  They thanked myself (a veteran) and my Grandson for our service and explained how sad they were for the events they had observed at the Festival.  What a wonderful gesture and pleasant surprise from a very concerned group of employees and employers.  I have in the past experienced wonderful service and food.  These people are incredibly gracious, attentive and professional.  It felt like family.  Just wish to thank them for their kindness and tell them they have a customer for life.  We plan to visit them often. They are exactly what a people business should be and they demonstrate great pride in our city and community.  We would recommend them to anyone interested in great food and service in Henderson.  Thank you all for being so wonderful, concerned and thankful. You are the best.

It should be ham, turkey, swiss on bread that is egg dipped and deep fried then sprinkled with powdered sugar.  Side for added flavor is either maple syrup or a sweet jelly/jam such as strawberry.  Well,  they got the ham, turkey and cheese ok (but not much of it) and the bread was like almost a whole loaf!  It was deep fried but you though you were eating slightly flavored bread.  They provided some sort of a berry \"dip\" to spread but overall it couldn't hold a candle to New York Deli (that burned down 10 years ago) or the Pine Tree Restaurant of Spring Mountain that CLOSED two years ago.  Short version... there's no where in Southern Nevada that knows how to make a Monte Cristo.  Part two...my wife had the bar-b-que sandwich which was ok BUT...they provided their version of a bar-b-que sauce that was the color, consistency and FLAVOR of catsup with a little bit of pickle in it.  She ate the sandwich but the sauce was a waste of time.  Service was very good but that's all this place had going for it.    Our one, and only, trip there.",

We had tried the one in the southwest part of Vegas and since this is now in walking distance if the need arises to actually walk some where. We arrived and were seated Immediately. Are waiter was really great, I forget his name, but he also works at Black Bear Diner so he was a familiar face. I had simple Sausage and egg breakfast with a side of B & G. Josie had Pancake Breakfast. The order came quickly and we enjoyed our meal. I will have to say the meals are not really stunning as Diner food goes. However, you get a great meal that fills the plate and your stomach. The staff is friendly and the wait for anything is minimal. Price wise it is on average with any diner in Vegas. Thank you for Dining at Metro Diner. We will definitely return here. We would like to try lunch or dinner as well. It is quick and easy to get to and food is good. If in Henderson and you would like a great meal, check them out you will not be disappointed.",

    "text": "WHERE THE LOCALS EAT!!!  Had to try this location because i had been to the one on rainbow and forgot to review it....so I took my staff here for our monthly luncheon! We had employees that helped the contractor who was building this location so we wanted to come support them. My 1st experience at the Rainbow location was good. The food was great but the atmosphere was a little less than I enjoyed. I know this is a diner but the person calling back the orders to the chefs was extremely loud and was very distracting from trying to have a conversation at my table. I ordered the burger that was made with 2 grilled cheese sandwiches and the burger in the middle. It was yummy. I have to say I am extremely picky when it comes to meat...this was good. Well seasoned. I like the lettuce slaw...mayo, lettuce and pickles...perfect idea. For me the only thing that could have made it better was if the crusts were cut off the grilled cheese sandwiches. It was a lot to try to wrap my mouth around and I was very disappointed in the mac N cheese. I thought at a diner it would have been amazing but it tasted like noodles with canned cheese on top. My man had the fried chicken plate. He said it was really good. Very tasty chicken and juicy. At the Stephanie location , although it was brand new, a lot of employees with trainers, the feeling and vibe was SO much better. The noise was just the patrons enjoying themselves not a man yelling out orders. Our waitress altough new was very pleasant and did a great job. Her trainer...omg...you guys need to promote him. I wish i remebered his name...he was from Rainbow he said and has only been with the company for 2 months. You would have thought he had been with you for 10 years. My staff all ordered something completely different.  Huevos rancheros with chocolate chip,banana pankcakes and the other was a burger with swiss,bacon and mushrooms. I ordered the pastrami sandwich on rye! As I stated i am very picky about meat so I was a little hesitant to try the pastrami and I am SOOOO glad I did. It was the best I have ever had!  I will definitely be returning to the Stephanie location!!! I will let my photos speak for themselves!",

My reuben sandwich was mouth watering perfection. It was exactly made New York style. Mac - cheese was cheesy delicious. Also had the mango ice tea .The staff is super friendly and accommodating. The diner was spotless.I highly recommend this place.",

    "text": "Went and took my Son to DMV and for passing his driving test we decided to take him out for breakfast. On the way to the DMV we saw Metro Diner and of course yelped it. They received good reviews so it was our turn to try it out. The place gets really busy but we were able to be seated right away. It's very clean and has a contemporary country type of feel. Every employee we met was energetic and friendly. Kyle our server was great. The bussers and the hostesses where real top-notch. Even the owner Peter came over and was super friendly and helpful and it's good to see the owner out there helping and in the public eye. There are lots of food choices and I apologize to my vegan friends but not too many vegan choices. I had the oatmeal with bananas, home fries and rye toast with jelly. I can't say enough about the service as it really was perfect. The food portions are large which is great because who doesn't love leftovers. My son got the scrambled eggs with hash browns and toast and my wifey ordered the veggie omelet with home fries and rye toast. Now my food was great mind you would doesn't seem like it's a difficult meal but I've seen people mess up oatmeal. It was absolutely good. I then have to go with my better Parts opinion and she was very happy with the food. My son really enjoyed his food too it's kind of hard getting a real opinion out of a teenager but by the way he ate I'm guessing he really liked it. We all said we would come back here again. So Henderson Metro Diner good job! Two thumbs up very high! You also get the Boom Shaka Laka Laka Boom award 4 an overall five star experience!",

The crust was not cooked through and was doughy inside. The chicken was cold and the remainder tasted like wallpaper paste. The meatloaf was OK but far from delicious . We sent back the pot pie and asked for a second meat loaf.  Before the new meal arrived we were presented with a check from our clueless server.  This restaurant is nothing special.  The manager did her best to apologize and even picked up our check and sent us away with a coupon towards a future visit. It will be a long time before we try this place again.",

John was actually our server and he was helpful and nice, he came to check on us a couple of times and made recommendations as to what we should eat since it was our fist time there. My mom and sister had the chicken and waffles and they were great, I ordered the frutty waffle and I loved it, it was huge. Great for a breakfast for sure, food came out super fast. Once we were almost done a gentleman came and asked us how everything was and if we had and complaints but we enjoyed everything from our meal to the service. The fruit on my waffle was fresh and my waffle was fluffy, my side of hash brows were crispy on the outside just like I like them. Great food and good prices!",

When I had took my first bite of my waffle it was so tasty and surprisingly very light. That explains why there's so much chicken!  And the sweet and spicy syrup went well with the strawberry butter. The chicken it self was so juicy. I couldn't put it down. Customer turn over was quick. I'm happily to say I'm coming back again.",

Our 5 yr old fell in love with the biscuits and gravy. My favorite is the meat lovers omelet. Our favorite Server John A. was there and welcomed us warmly.  He is always friendly and attentive and has a joke or silly story to share. We are usually there for breakfast and John always tries to push the cobbler. We finally went for dinner, the chicken and waffles is amazing, the Shrimp and grits are delicious and so is the peach cobbler.  I recommend for breakfast, lunch or dinner.",

When we got in it was pretty busy and there was a short 5-10 minute wait for our table. There was coffee and water in the waiting area which was a nice surprise.   We were greeted promptly by our server who was super friendly and energetic.   I settled on a breakfast burrito. When it came out I was overwhelmed by the size of it. As I dug in I quickly realized it was a classic example of quantity over quality. The burrito was covered with salsa which made it soggy on the bottom. I found that the egg whites inside were a little bland and needed salt. The burrito was filled with egg whites, green peppers, and black olives.   Service fell off towards the end with our drinks running empty.   The food was just OK. Maybe it was just what I ordered?",

I should've took a picture but a picture was the last thing on my mind since it looked so yummy and I was starving lol.  My grandparents ordered the fried chicken sandwich and that too was huge and delicious!  If you get to choose your waiter, John was pleasant/funny and very attentive.

    "text": "I was in the neighborhood at lunch time, and had heard good things from a couple of friends, so I thought I would give Metro Diner a try. The ambience is typical old-school Diner Ambience with lots of booths and specials written on a Blackboard on the far wall. The menu is pretty much breakfast and lunch Comfort Foods with nothing really exciting. Breakfast has lots of waffles pancakes and omelettes. Lunch menu has hamburgers and salads. I went with a western omelette. The Omelette was large and filled with typical western omelette goodies. It had a very tasty salsa on the side. I got a side of cut up fruit for a $0.50 up charge. Overall it was a filling tasty meal with pleasant service. If I lived in the neighborhood I probably would go back. But there's certainly nothing special about this Diner that would make me want to travel to it.",

    "text": "I've been a huge fan of Metro diner since their first original location here in Las Vegas. This location did not cease to impress or live up to their standards.  We went there couple of days for lunch. It was a Friday afternoon around 230 and it seems their lunch crowd had just left and their dinner rush had not yet begun. This location had the same warm inviting feel as the other locations. Very organized and very clean and definitely living up to the standards.  I went ahead and started off with the mango iced tea that was suggested. Perfectly sweet and refreshing for a warm day. My friend had the orange juice. Definitely not fresh squeezed but pretty good.  I want to head with the daily special and had the shrimp po boy. The whole sandwich was a hit from start to finish. Perfectly golden fried shrimp tossed in a spicy mayo. Fresh tomatoes and green onions on a perfectly fresh roll. Served with fries. For $12 this is a sure hit. Shrimp were fried perfectly and not greasy at all. Loved the chipotles ranch sauce that comes with it. Gave it a solid 5/5  My friend had the vegetable omelette without the cheese. Fresh vegetable medley filled this golden fluffy omelette. Served with Home style potatoes. Everything went well together. The potatoes were \"rejuvenated\". More than likely prepared early in the day and then heated. Way to dark and greasy but everything else was great.  Great place for breakfast lunch or dinner. Staff was friendly. Definitely a step above any regular coffee shop.",

The Turkey sausage links were u der cooked but in the plus side the eggs were scrambled lightly as requested.  The entire meal was $13 not including tip.  A little pricey for my liking.  If I do go again, it would have to be on someone elsea dime. I wanted to try the chicken and waffles but at $15, no way.",

The Charleston Shrimp & Grits is my favorite.  The roasted red pepper grit cakes are topped a delicious shrimp and sausage sauce.  It's a very generous dish with always leftovers to take home.    The Metro Club is also a nicely done sandwich with the amount of meat and ingredients piled into it.  It's lightly toasted bread tries to hold together the mile high sandwich.  I opted to try the Mac & Cheese with the sandwich.  It's decadent and creamy.  I would absolutely order it again as a good side dish.    Seriously the service here is so friendly.   Our drinks are always filled and multiple staff members check on our dining experience.  They truly seem to pride themselves on providing wonderful service to their patrons.

Metro does more than just breakfast, but so far I've only dined in for breakfast. The food is good, service is friendly, and it's a quick dine-in option.  Metro is on their game with efficiently serving up good food. We've never had to wait long for a table and the food is quick to arrive at the table. The front of the restaurant has a comfortable waiting area for busy times. The servers have been friendly and accommodating. The inside of the restaurant has an old school diner feel, but cleaner and more open.  I've enjoyed a Crab Cake Benedict and Sausage Gravy & Biscuits. Both were delicious and came out as generous portions. The hash browns on the side were tasty too. My orders have been correct and well prepared both times. Next time I'll have to try the signature Chicken & Waffles!",

My husband loves the food so much he usually orders something to take home. The first time I ordered a Yo Hala with a side of turkey sausage. All I have to say is YUM! The Yo Hala was pretty sweet, but the salt from the sausage balanced it out. My dad and husband got the chicken and waffles with strawberry butter. It comes with a lot of food so if you're hungry you will be satisfied. If you're not that hungry you can either share it with a friend or take home the leftovers. My husband ordered the Holy Davoli sandwich to go. He ate that for his late night dinner.   The second time we went I ordered a chicken pot pie. I loved it because it wasn't too thick or have too much crust like some I've tried before. My dad ordered the meatloaf and husband ordered the chicken & waffles again. My husband sampled the chicken pot pie and like it so much he cleaned the bowl for me (see pictures). lol. He also liked my dad's meatloaf so he ordered a meatloaf sandwich to go. We tried the strawberry cobbler for dessert. It had a hard piece of ice cream on top which melted with the warmth from the cobbler. It was a little sweet, but it went well with the ice cream.   I'd definitely order the same things again, but I want to explore more of the menu. I think we'll be going again today. I wonder what I'll get this time...",

    "text": "Metro Diner (Henderson, NV)  It really doesn't take much to please me when it comes to breakfast food.  Good food, large portions, great value, and superb customer service is enough to make me a repeat customer. Heck, it's enough to give an establishment 5 Stars.  I've been to all of the Metro Diner locations in Las Vegas.  A couple of things are guaranteed whenever I dine at Metro Diner  #1:  I am always going to order a cup of their broccoli and cheese soup #2:  I am always leaving stuffed #3:  The service is excellent  Metro Diner has a few signature items like the Chicken & Waffles, Monte Cristo, Chicken Pot Pie, Bold Burger, and Shrimp Grits.  The Chicken Pot Pie is a \"must try\" as well as their Chicken & Waffles.  My go-to meals at Metro Diner is their Meat Lover's Omelet and a cup of their broccoli and cheese soup.  The Meat Lover's Omelet is not on the menu, but they will create it upon request.  Metro Diner has also created a protein only breakfast for me, which consist of eggs, bacon, hamburger patty or chicken breast, and sausage.  The good stuff!!  Metro Diner is consistent when it comes to servicing their guest.  Regardless if they're jammed packed or dead slow, I have never received anything less than stellar service.   Great Job, Metro Diner!!  TIP #1:  Hours (Sun-Thurs 7:00 AM-8:00 PM, Fri-Sat 7:00 AM-9:00 PM) TIP #2:  Metro Diner is great about substitutions.  TIP #3:  Daily Double.  Two visits in one day equal a 10% discount on the 2nd visit.",

Our server Laura was an absolute delight and was so honest and helpful. I personally ordered the monte cristo and it was absolutely delicious! The plate was bigger than  expected. My partner had the Charleston Shrimp & Grits and it was so tasty. The rest of the table had the chicken and waffle with strawberry butter and spicy syrup. At first, that concoction seems like a stomach ache waiting to happen but the strawberry butter ties in the whole spicy syrup combo making a very unique and savory experience worth trying! This place is worth the time and you won't be disappointed!!! If you ever come in, ask for Laura and I guarantee you will enjoy your eating experience!",

Kids had yogurt with berries and granola and the portions were huge. And finally a side of cheesy grits with butter that were amazing! All the kids said eer have to come here more often. Think this will be replacing black bear for us.  *Second visit, seated immediately, server was extremely friendly and helpful.

    "text": "A year ago 10/2/17 I came in for breakfast with dirty clothes and birds nest hair from escaping the Route 91 shooting. My boyfriends grandparents took us out to breakfast cuz nothing makes things better like breakfast! But nothing was more upsetting than walking in and seeing smiling faces enjoying breakfast and the world going on after 58 people had just been murdered.   I cried when an employee asked if he could get us a drink and I cried when our server asked how we were all doing. They probably had no idea why I was crying until the grandparents told them we had just had the worst night of our lives. Our server was patient, understanding, soothing, and so kind. The food was probably delicious just like it was three days before when we went for breakfast, but I couldn't tell ya for sure due to being in shock. A manager bought our meal when she got word of our situation and her kindness made me cry even more, and it even shook my boyfriend up a bit who hardly ever cries. It was so nice to be met with such genuine kindness and care after losing faith in humanity.   I can't say enough thanks to the staff that morning that brought a bit of light into the oncoming dark months. It's been a year and I realized every time I think of that morning it makes me emotional because of the amazing staff that showed sympathy and care. THANK YOU METRO DINER for a wonderful memory in a cluster of terrible ones. Sorry I'm a year late.",

This was also my first time ordering the steak philly, which I do not recommend.  First the positive, the bun is soft and yummy.  Now the ick, the meat was burnt and lacked flavor.  Also, I have a mushroom allergy and after eating almost half the sandwich, the last couple bites tasted strange so I opened it to notice mushrooms.  I had to get my check and leave so I could take some meds.  The fries were really salty and seemed old, I'd say the pickle had less salt lol.   I will return to Metro, not this location and never will I order this sandwich.    I would highly recommend if you want a perfect philly, go to Peppermill, it's worth the drive.",

I was happy to see that this location opened up because it is closer to me than the other two locations in town.  Overall, the food was good with the exception of the fish and chips which were HORRIBLE. Small, thin, sad little pieces of fish with a weird texture. And the tartar sauce was just glorified relish. I couldn't bring myself to finish the dish.  We were seated promptly upon entering, but after that, the service was pretty terrible. One guy noticed we had been waiting awhile and announced that he wasn't actually our server, but would get us drinks. Ruby was our server and only came by our table to take our order and to take the bill. The first guy and bus boy checked on us more than she did. Plus she left me with the IPad after I paid instead of waiting the five seconds to wait for me to just sign and be done with it. Felt weird to be left with such important equipment. I also waited a good portion of time for her to bring the receipt, but it wasn't until I got fed up and started to walk out that she scurried over to our table and handed my mother the receipt.  I will give them 2 stars because the rest of the staff was AMAZING! People got the door for us and even though this first guy wasn't our server, he went out of his way to help us out.  I know this diner is new and they are still probably trying to figure things out, but I feel disappointed considering it has rave reviews from everyone else. I feel jipped.",

    "text": "Wow--what happened to the service here???  Decided to take my father, who was visiting from out of town, out to lunch here on a Sunday. We were seated right away, but everything else went downhill from there. We ordered a club sandwich and the fish and chips, a seemingly straightforward order. After waiting for our food and not having seen our waiter for about 25-30 minutes, my father finally was able to flag our waiter down and asked him when our food would be ready. The waiter seemed confused and said he did not see that our orders had been entered and asked us what we wanted again. After he was gone for a few minutes, he came back and informed us that the kitchen had told him our food would be out right away. We saw several tables who were seated after us receive their food. Probably after waiting another 5-10 minutes we decided it was time to go. We were getting up from the table when the waiter hurriedly delivered the club sandwich and said the fish would be out soon. We told him we would take our food to go. No way were we going to sit there for much longer. Someone, who was not our waiter, came and brought the boxed sandwich to our table and said, \"Sorry about the wait.\" Then finally, about 40-50 minutes after we placed our order (the first time?), the boxed fish and chips came out. The waiter apologized and said that the kitchen had \"burned the fish\" and that was the cause for the delay. He told us there would be no charge for our lunch.  I was so embarrassed to have brought my father to this place and I would certainly feel embarrassed and angry to return to eat here. The food tasted pretty good, but the terrible service is what stood out. I'm not sure if our order was lost, never entered, or the kitchen \"burned the fish\" that was the cause of a 40-50 minute wait time on a club sandwich and fish and chips. Ordinarily I'm pretty forgiving of sluggish service if the place is very crowded. While the diner was busy (but no wait time at the front), this long of a wait for a club sandwich and fish and chips seems kind of excessive (especially after seeing tables seated after us being served their food and finishing their meals all in this time span). Although I appreciate our waiter saying there would be no charge, it is kind of disappointing that unhappy customers were never apologized to by a manager. Funnily enough our waiter said he hoped we would come back another time at the end of all this! Sadly, I don't think I'll return.",

Kitchen, quiet, and the food is sub par; a FAR cry from what it was, and that's amazing considering there isn't much of a wait anymore and the kitchen cooked a lot better when it was busy!  Today, my \"special\" country fried steak breakfast was flat out BURNT and they tried to conceal that by putting the worst side down and hiding the rest of it under gravy. Problem is, burnt is burnt and you discover that when you first cut into the damn thing! It was SO bad, my server saw it and without even saying a word( she was totally embarrassed, so it's not like she was trying to be rude) she took it away to show management and the kitchen.  Problem is NO ONE from management came over to the table, NO ONE!!!! If they had, they'd have also discovered the hash browns were equally as offensive; SCORCHED!! Every since this \"Lynn\" became a manager at this location the place seems to have fallen apart, from the hostess station and hostesses and the kitchen.  We love the server crew, ALL of them are wonderful (shout out to Ida, Kyle and April, all of whom are top notch and apologies to the others we haven't had the pleasure of meeting) and you can see they bust their butts to make up for things. But folks, the experience starts at the hostess station and ends with the kitchen, and when 2 of the 3 fundamentals of making and keeping a great restaurant are as jacked up as this one is, it's over!  The writing is on the wall in this place, and it's fixable. Question is, will they?!  I was HIGHLY put off that this manager was talking to the next table about the fish and chips when I ate NOTHING and not so much as an apology or \"is there something else we can get you instead\"!  You may very well have lost my families business and we have been coming here at LEAST once a week for over a year and are HEAVY tippers!  There have been several other incidents in the past  I haven't mentioned, but like a bad marriage, you can love it, but there comes a time when you gotta leave it and move on.",

    "text": "Tried Metro out as wife said this place had great reviews and it was a brand new place. Hosts were nice and it was a short wait to get seated as it didn't look like they were too busy (Sunday afternoon).   After being seated we had to wait an extremely long time (~10 mins) before we were greeted by a server. Guy was very nice, took our drinks, and let us know that our actual server will check on us soon. During this wait we overheard the table next to us asking for a manager to complain about the service. Honestly, this should have been our first red flag. After waiting ANOTHER 5-10 mins our actual server showed up and took our orders. She didn't know how to work the ordering tool that well which was strange (Place just opened. Didn't you get trained?).  For the drinks, I tried the sweetened peach tea and it was super (extremely) sweet. Mixed it half and half with wife's water and it was still a bit too sweet but very tasty.  For the food, I got the Monte Cristo with chips which was excellent in taste and portion. The berry sauce it came with was equally amazing. I would recommend that dish if you're going to come here.   The wife got the fish and chips which were terrible. I thought she was exaggerating so I tried some but they really were awful. The fish were soggy on the outside instead of crispy, they were totally bland and the tater sauce tasted more like relish in a cup. Would not recommend that dish to anyone. My wife just ended up having part of my Monte Cristo and left almost the entirety of the fish and chips.   Mother-in-law got the bacon mushroom swiss burger with fries. She said the burger was extremely good but the fries were already cold when they reached the table. Brother-in-law got the bold city burger which he said was excellent (and looked excellent) but same issue with the fries.  During the meal we were checked up on by a few people, none of which were our server. Unfortunately no one refilled waters or sodas even once during the meal. The original person who took our drinks left the check for us which is weird (where is our server?). After finishing we waited another 5 minutes after the bus boy took our plates before the server sort of stumbled passed our table, noticed we were done, and asked us if we wanted a box for the fish and chips and took our payment.  In the end, this was a disappointing experience. The burgers and sandwiches may be good but a lot of work needs to be done with the service and I don't know how they could possibly fix the disgrace that they call their fish and chips.  Tl;Dr Service was bad. Burgers and sandwiches were good and the only thing that saved the meal. Fish and chips were a disgrace.",

    "text": "We were visiting from out of town and wanted to get breakfast before driving back to L.A. When we pulled into the parking lot there were two Henderson police cruisers parked in front of the restaurant. My friend said that was a good sign because cops usually know where the better places are to grab a bite. Well, he was right because it turned out to be the most delicious waffle breakfast I've had in a long time. They even served real maple syrup (not the fake stuff that claims it's real but is made in a factory.) The tea selection was on par with what you'd expect at an afternoon tea in Kensington. Our server was friendly and efficient. Food came out quickly yet we never felt rushed.  The manager even thanked us personally and held the door open for us on our way out. Lesson of the day: When in doubt, dine where the cops do :D",

Our food was really good. I got the chicken pot pie which was way too hot to eat for like 30mins I ate what I could and took the rest home. My fiance got the San Francisco Benedict which was really good! It was his first time eating it and he was pretty happy with it especially not knowing what to expect. But definitely a rip off for a really small, not even a full cup of apple juice charged us $3. Overall it's a good place to go for breakfast, lunch or dinner.",

I was super excited to eat here based on the reviews but the best I can give this restaurant is a 3. I ordered the huevos rancheros which came with chorizo and fried jalapenos. I had to salt pepper and add much hot sauce to give this any flavor at all. I'm going to give it at 3 because it wasn't bad it just wasn't good. My friend ordered the chicken and waffles and enjoyed her dinner much more than I enjoyed mine. She rated hers a 4.",

This place did not disappoint !! We were greeted promptly at hostess area and seated asap , seats were comfy and menus were presented , being hungry we really had to study it to decide what would satiate us ! There are so many great choices , our server was patient and great ( didn't get her name but she was Hispanic and very very helpful in narrowing our choices ) I opted for the American omelette with biscuit and a side of gravy my friend ordered a big breakfast plate and to start off we had to share a cup of baked potato soup, the soup came out piping hot and dressed with cheese and bacon and tasted amazing, along comes the omelette stuffed full of paper thin steak, mushrooms,onions and cheese ( I added American , it's the way to go ). It was also served with home fries which were big chunks of potatoes that were perfectly cooked and crispy on outside and hot and soft inside ! The combo of flavors in omelette were on point ! When my fork hit the cheese pockets I was in heaven !! My friend did share a piece of her waffle which was perfectly crisp and delicious , try it with strawberry butter !! All in all I will be back and try the monte Cristo sandwich !!",

Our server was not attetentive to our table although we were her only customers. She was to busy socializing and texting on her phone. So I had to constantly get her attention for refills on coffee and water. The food potion are not equal to the servings.  Overly priced.  I won't be returning.",

We had an exceptional waiter by the name of John A., he recommended that I try the customer favorite Chicken and Waffles. It was by far the best that I've ever had! John A. Made a special sweet and spicy sauce table-side, it went amazing with the chicken. And the waffles were perfect with banana and strawberry and whipped cream. Overall awesome experience!",

It's been hard to find good chicken and waffles here in Las Vegas all the places we have tried we don't like it but this place is the best. My honey got the egg benedict and he loved it but mainly loved my plate. Also the portions of their food is great , you leave with a full tummy.  New favorite spot for breakfast, definatley loved this place.",

We did not want to eat at the casino so I went to yelp and found the Metro diner. We were greeted by the hostess she sat us an said waitress would be right  the specials were on chalkboard in the back of the restaurant. I had the special which there was a great amount to choose from, breakfast lunch an dinner. All day long . I had the cheeseburger Benedict. Outstanding. Chorizo little to burnt for my liking but all around was really good. My only regret was filling up on soda before my meal came. Damn you Coca Cola for tasting so good.",

The food is very inventive and well cooked.  I was told that they don't have a microwave since they insist all the food is cooked completely fresh.  The staff is incredible and treats me as if I were a family member every time I come in.   Since this location opened I don't think I have been to another restaurant.  Food is very reasonably priced and always top notch.",
