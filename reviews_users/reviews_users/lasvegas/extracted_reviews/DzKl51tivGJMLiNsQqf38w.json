Once arriving at Island Sushi we waited for 10 minutes to be seated, we finally decided that our best course of action would be  to seat ourselves and only then did we receive acknowledgment from the staff which rudely told us to go back and wait to be seated while they rudely talked amongst each other. I give them a one star because of there horrific service",

It was super fishy and stale. When it came to the bill the manager informed us we had to pay for the uneaten scallop roll. We told him it was inedible, he informed us that they charge $2 a piece for the uneaten roll even if it is inedible. WTF. Will never go there again!",

I'm back at Island Sushi as a Las Vegas resident! Came here the other night... AYCE!!!  I'm a huge fan! Everything I love from seaweed salad, poke, lomi salmon, mochiko chicken, garlic chicken, teri beef, malasada, coco puffs, unique rolls with fun names... I'm sold!  I wish I.S. was closer to me... I would be there weekly for sure!   If you're looking for Hawaiian food and sushi with a local twist... Island Sushi is the hot spot!  I feel at home when I'm here... locals everywhere... Big Island pictures on the wall... including Hilo my hometown... one of the girls working there as a server is from Hilo... I love being around Hawaii people!  I'll be back for my Hawaiian fix... AYCE works for me!   A must while in Vegas!  Mahalo Island Sushi! -Miss Yelp 2011",

Poke lacked the awesome seasoning as other Hawaiian food restaurants in Las Vegas. Probably won't be back for another couple years.",

When I'm finally seated, the waiter comes to my table 15 minutes later asking how is everything. Well considering he hasn't even taken my order. I would say Everything is horrible! I get my first round of sushi. Then I sit and wait 30 more minutes without any service . I would not recommend this place to anyone. When I order all you can eat sushi that's what I expect to receive. Not two rolls and over and an hour of waiting. Save your money and not to mention I was so irritated I didn't even get dessert. This place is a joke. I will never waste my time again.",

    "text": "This review is for the sushi portion of dinner. The restaurant is located on Eastern past Serene, but before Richmar. If you get up to BJs, you've gone too far. Inside of the restaurant is sectioned off in to two areas. Entrance area seems to be designated for traditional Hawaiian grilled dishes, and the area thru the door on the right is the sit down sushi area. We came here on a Friday night and it was packed. They do have a wide selection of AYCE sushi and many sides to choose from (although the sides appear to be half of what you'd get if you were ordering a la carte).  The AYCE menu has two symbols that denote different things. Chopsticks next to the item indicate it is a dinner only item, while the sushi icon indicates it is one order per person.  The rolls were fine and fish relatively fresh. One thing to note is their speciality rolls were in fact not drenched in Yum sauce or mayo concoctions of any sort. A lot of what we ordered had their garlic sauce on the roll itself, and I wasn't a fan. It tasted like gin ...I know strange.    We sample several rolls: Joe's Special, Black Widow, Spicy Mexican, Lava Lover, Lasagna, Surf and Turf. I also had their scallop mayo and salmon nigiri. The salmon was fresh, the scallop mayo was very bland and forgettable. My favorite roll of the group was Spicy Mexican, the rest were decent, but nothing I would rush to eat again.  The service was fine, minus the initial hiccup. It took a little over 20 minutes to get our first three rolls to the table. I know that it wasn't our servers fault, and it was pretty packed in there. They didn't bring it out roll by roll so we had food coming throughout, instead they waited for all rolls to be made before they brought them out. I guess it makes more sense that way, especially with being so packed.  So although, famished by the time we got the food, I won't hold it against them.  I would recommend this place is you want more simple, non yum sauce heavy rolls with fresh fish and friendly service.",

Wiped out a rainbow roll, chicken katsu and the 808 Special (a humongous dessert with deep fried bananas, 2 scoops of ice cream, fruits and whipped cream).  Did I mention that their malasadas are the best that I've had on the mainland?  Cause they are!!  Okay, I've only been here one, but for that one visit....oh man!  They were so good!  I hope that the next time we go here, there malasadas are still scrumptiously divinely yummy!!  It is located off of the Strip so if you're visiting Vegas, then you'll have to drive or take a taxi.  It is worth it though!  If you are from Vegas, then check them out for yourself.",

The prices are standard for AYCE ($21.95 for lunch and $26.95 for dinner) and well worth it. You have many choices of appetizers/sides and my favorites are the ahi poke (from Poke Express), mochiko chicken, garlic chicken, sashimi salad, and kimchee fried rice. Good stuff. I like to order the hand rolls with hamachi (yellowtail) and sake (salmon). Fresh and delicious. My favorite specialty rolls are the Black Widow, Dragon, Island Special, Tiger, Kahuku, and Pauhana.  We celebrated my dad's birthday there last May and it was also Mother's Day so we participated in the AYCE Sushi plus Sunday brunch. The special menu featured breakfast favorites like pancakes and mimosas. There were also additional desserts that were unlimited like cream puffs and filled malasadas (they were both so, so good). I thought it was just for the holiday, but I saw a similar menu during another visit, so it may be a Sunday Brunch thing. Either way, I recommend a visit with the special menu because it made the meal so much better.",

Young lady in the front is always very cheerful and recommends faves of customers if you have no clue what to get. Desserts are so (Ono) delicious and my pick is always the malasadas filled with custard. At the poke counter you can find lots of island favorites like the ahi shoyu, tako, raw crab, dried aku, poi, and lots more (pupus) appetizers to please that hungry belly. My faves are the limu ahi and the Kim chi raw crab. They are decently priced in my opinion, but others may think otherwise. Im always satisfied!",

My mom ordered the garlic chicken (DO NOT ORDER IT!) as her choice in the combination, and it was greasy and unappetizing, she didn't even eat it.

Last time the food was pretty bad the sushi was really bad unfortunately it hasn't improved I think it's gotten worse.  The sushi is really terrible $21 lunch for all you can eat the miso soup is out of the machine or freeze dried a lot of the fish is obviously frozen. The shrimp tempura was greasy. The appetizer was frozen gyoza. The garlic chicken was burnt and greasy like you don't change the oil kind of greasy. I haven't had the take out part but the sit down food is  bad. How anybody gives this place more than two stars must have a low expectation of getting good food for their money.  I try to be fair but damn get your act together.",

They also have a legit all you can eat ($22 for lunch $27 for breakfast), but we chose to go a la carte. We ordered 5 rolls, all delicious: tempura roll, spider roll, tekka maki roll, salmon lover roll, and the poke roll. Final cost was $30 with tax and tip for 2 people and I was surely satisfied. The tuna was realllllyyyyy good and all the tempura was super crispy. Service was also awesome! Can't wait to visit again...probably for AYCE! Only bummer is its way off the strip and probably not worth the trek if you are in a strip hotel.",

    "text": "Despite my anticipation going in, I was underwhelmed.   This is an unassuming little place tucked in a strip mall on Eastern. When you walk in, you enter the grill side (order at counter). To the right, is the sushi side. Both sides have a sort of dive feel. And not that \"isn't this so neat\" dive feel. More of the \"where's the posted letter grade\" dive feel.  The servers were definitely friendly and the service was perfectly fine.   The menu is fairly lengthy with a good variety of different types of rolls. I tried 4 different sushi rolls and the edamame. All were just \"eh\". Everything was too squishy and nothing tasted particularly fresh. And I wasn't impressed by any of the flavor combinations (despite them sounding good).  Maybe I just ordered the wrong items? Neither the food nor the atmosphere made the mark for me. There are definitely far better strip mall sushi joints out there.",

However both myself and my dining companion ended up with upset stomachs shortly after leaving. The tables were very close together. In an almost empty restaurant, they sat us all in the same section. It did not give us much room to maneuver with a toddler and was not pleasant having to hear every word of the conversation of the people next to us. Half way through our meal, our waiter just disappeared. It took several minutes to get one of the people standing around to assist us. A very sweet and friendly waitress took over and assisted us took the end of our meal when our original waiter showed back up to hand us the bill with no explanation of his disappearance or apology. All in all, was very disappointed with my experience this time.",

There is a poke / seafood counter in here as well.  If you plan to order both food and poke you can tell the counter person and they will send it over to the \"food\" section and you will get rung up once.  There were authentic local Hawai'i people behind the counters at this place (I could tell) so you know they know what they're doing.  There is a place to sit inside very casually or you can go to the restaurant next door and dine in there - looks like a resto/sports bar atmosphere.    I got the Bento B, which comes with Garlic Ahi, (1) Chicken Option, Noodles, Takuwan, Furikake Rice, and 1 piece Spam.  I chose the Mochiko Chicken as my chicken option.  Lots of food in this bento and very filling.  Great taste, which reminds me of home, so it's a winner in my book.  Haven't tried the sushi, so I can't comment on that.",

Service - Not bad, not memorable, but I would say pleasant or neutral. 2.  Pricing -All you can eat is not bad at all, but they do limit some of the more expensive items like uni. 3.  Recommend- if you have kids under 10, go for the all you can eat. The appetizers have so many of the teriyaki chicken, beef and basics that kids will like and you do not have to order real sushi for them. 4.  Try the hawaiian grill items in the cafe next door. Great stuff. 5.  Overall - not a bad place. the authentic basic sushi's are great tasting.",

Because I wanted to record everything that happened because of their stupid phone service...  Minute 1:  Them: Island sushi and grill can I help you? Me: Hi can i place a take out order? Them: Ok can I put you on hold for a little? *finishes up taking an order*  Minute 2 - 4: *background noise*  Minute 5: *Them taking another order*  Minute 6: *someone drops dishes*  Minute 7: Them: Hello? 1 second later hangs up...  I'm a regular and unless their customer service improves I will not be returning here just the mere fact that their staff is incapable of \"completing an order before pissing the customer off\"",

    "text": "I've been frequenting Island Sushi for a good 6 or 7 years long before I ever Yelped. The Island atmosphere and sushi keep me coming back at least two to three times per year. I come most often with my work colleagues during lunch and they consistently get us in and out for a power AYCE lunch in less than an hour during the busiest times. The efficiency at lunch, the poke, and the desserts separate Island from some of the other AYCE sushi places.  I came for Tuesday lunch with my wife on my most recent visit and we had a very enjoyable meal. A California roll is the closest thing to sushi my wife will eat, but she still has plenty to choose from. The teishoku combination B is plenty of food for $14 (see picture). For AYCE, the ahi poke is a must. When I'm with my buddies, they order more rolls which are pretty standard at lunch, but I stick with nigiri. I'm not a sauce person for much of anything, and while the sake with orgasm sauce isn't quite orgasmic, it's a sauce that's creamy with some tart that I'll definitely make an exception for. The garlic tuna is another nigiri that we all like that is better than most places. I do like the white fishes like red snapper and halibut, but unfortunately, they don't carry these.  Make sure you save room for dessert too. I'll usually get the \"808\" Special and green tea ice cream. The tempura ice cream is solid, the creme brulee is a favorite of my daughter, and the malassada sundae is a dessert that is unique to Island.  Lunch AYCE is $21.95 and dinner is $26.95. They have discounted rolls and drinks during happy hour along with AYCD house sake for AYCE patrons. Service is mostly friendly and accommodating, as it was on our last visit. We've had occasional visits where service has been slow and I think that is completely dependent on who is serving you and if they are on island time or not.  The dining room is small and the sushi bar has about 5 or 6 seats so expect a wait during the peak times for dinner. A crowded lot with no spots will be the best indication of their volume. The longest we've waited was 30 minutes on a Friday night after we signed our name on the list. The advantage of coming in for dinner is that you get to have many of the items that are not available at lunch such as the raw crab poke, raw tako wasabi, and the kalbi ribs.  Island Sushi has been consistent for me for years and here's to many more.",

The Customer Service is excellent, everyone was so nice and greeted me and made sure I was helped. The Oxtail soup came out with 2 scoops of rice, green onions and ginger. Upon taking that first taste, I felt like I was on the Island. The flavors were all there and then I got to the oxtail, it fell off the bone and just melted in my mouth. This is the Oxtail soup I remembered when I was in Hawaii and I can't wait to have it again! It was a large portion so I had to pack half of it to-go. To top that off, I had 2 malasadas: Plain and Haupia. Both were amazing, very close to Leonard's Bakery. If you are having Island withdrawals and want some delicious food, this is the place to be.",

I ordered the slow roasted pork loco moco and my boyfriend got their Thai shrimp sushiritto and both were incredibly good!  The slow roasted pork loco moco was really tender and they gave a pretty generous amount (4 big slices)! it's served on a bed of white rice, covered in delicious brown gravy and topped with your choice of egg. It also comes with a side of macaroni! Such a great portion!  The sushiritto is made fresh to order, so it makes it so much more yummy! It is made tempura - style, so there's a nice crunch to every bite!  Also, definitely get the malasadas for dessert!! You can either get it with custard or chocolate filling or have it plain! Malasadas are almost like whole fat donuts rolled in cane sugar. Yummmmm! Try getting it fresh because that's when it's the best!!",

Our waiter gave us ok service but when he went on lunch the manager, I think her name was Stephanie which wasn't the best at giving us even a good service at that. Her vibe was totally negative and we just wanted out from there.  I think if we ever come back, we will just stick with the grilling side.",

I love the kalbi ribs, kimchi spam fried rice, and spam musabi. Their oxtail was not bad either. When it comes to dessert their coco puffs are delish, malasadas are yummy, and butter mochi is addicting. They had a pumpkin mochi in October that was amazing.  I highly recommend this restaurant, especially those who haven't experienced hawaiian food (like this Canadian).",

The pick up window section has standard Hawaiian plate lunches and a good selection of poke. The dine-in restaurant side of Island Sushi is small... Maybe 10 or so tables and a sushi bar.  Recently, we went on a Sunday for brunch. In addition to the standard AYCE lunch menu, they also included a special menu with items such as guava french toast, raw crab poke, & salmon skin salad. They even had bottomless mimosas for $7. The sushi was good and food came out fast. I would only wish that my mimosa would have been refilled faster but, all in all, I enjoyed brunch...!  FYI, there is a new poke place coming in the next center... I wonder how it will measure up to Island Sushi?",

    "text": "Came here over the weekend because my fellow 808 friends loves this place and swear that it's as close as it gets to home.  Us Mainlanders now gotta be on the lookout for Hawaii style cooking. :)  So for starters, they have daily specials and I wish it was a WEDNESDAY because they have Meat Jun.  Hopefully it tastes just as good as Dong Yang in my hometown in Wahiawa. Definitely need to make my way out to Vegas during the weekday.   Food:  Tako Poke Shoyu Poke with limu Spicy Ahi poke bowl Friday's special - Lau Lau plate with rice and long rice Fried Noodles with Kalbi And lastly for dessert 1 dozen malasadas  When you first walk in, there are dessert choices on the left hand side.  Also, looks like that's where you can order \"to go\" items.  Keep walking in and go straight to the POKE station where you'd find lots of different types of POKE.  On the right hand side is the dine in with a sushi bar.    Our server was alright and nothing really stood out.  Our food came quickly and everyone was really nice.  We even met the owner. Aloha!    For the food here's my opinion:  Poke was on point considering that I've had the opportunity to try all different places from San Diego's Best Poke and the infamous Foodland POKE so Island Sushi is good.  The lau lau was dry, unfortunately.  It was overcooked.   Fried Noodles and Kalbi was also good.  The kalbi was on point however the noodles lacked flavor which is fine so I added soy sauce. (I like salty food so that's my fault) Now for the malasadas.  Lots of places claim that they have good malasadas.  I will say that so far on the mainland, Island Sushi & Grill has the best.  We opt for 6 malasadas to eat at the table then took 6 to go.  It was good that I had to return before leaving Vegas for San Diego.  I called in my order and when I got there my order wasn't quite ready.  :( Which is fine so I waited.  The young lady (on a Sunday morning) grabbed a box from the warmer and filled a couple with custard.  This time around the malasadas wasn't as good.  Not sure why, it was also not as hot.  :(  I think I should've ordered when I got there instead. It probably would've been hot.    Aloha and Mahalo Island Sushi & Grill.  Definitely a restaurant I will return to when I'm in Vegas.   #islandgirlnette",

    "text": "I like Island Sushi & Grill because it is ideal for groups that include both sushi lovers and those that will not nosh on raw fish. While it is not my favorite place in town for sushi, it's a very solid option, and I have never been disappointed with any of the non-sushi items I've gotten.   Most of my visits to Island Sushi & Grill have been to pick up to go orders (and poke from Poke Express, located in the back) and these experiences have always been solid. To-go orders have always been ready when they said they would be, packaged up properly and handed over by a smiling employee.   On my most recent visit I took 3 out of towners: My brother-in-law and his wife aren't big on sushi so they got items from the grill side of the menu while a friend and I both did ACYE. Pricing for AYCE is in line with most spots in town. There are some limitations on the menu (the standards: certain items can only be ordered at dinner, some are limited to one per person, no sharing). All of the sushi we ordered was excellent, nigiri was cut well and had a good fish to rice ratio. My in-laws were pleased with their selections, and we all left happy and very full for a great price.  On Sundays, Island Sushi & Grill does an AYCE brunch that I am looking forward to trying soon.  If you love sushi but also love to dine with people are don't care for it, give Island Sushi & Grill a try.",

I called around 1:00 and the person who answered said they had just sold their last Guava cake. I asked if they would be able to bake another one. They said they would and it would be ready for pick up in two hours. the cake looked appealing with the shredded dry coconut flakes around the rim of the cake. The cake was the highlight of my entire dessert table and all my guests would not stop raving over how delicious it was. It was fairly priced at $20. Overall, I give my overall experience with this restaurant a 10/10 for their customer service and delicious bake goods! I will definitely be going back to try their Chantilly cake.",

Plate came with 2 scoops of rice, 2 slices of sweet bread and 2 eggs of choice. I felt that rice to meat ratio was off. SOOO much rice, which may be good for some but just felt that there wasn't enough sausage.   Everything served on styro containers which makes it easy to To-Go any left overs. No one else was dining at the time we were there (Sunday morning at 9am) but there were few people who came in for pick up and even more at the Poke counter.   What I would really like to RAVE about is the MALASADAS. I ordered the dozen (about $15) 6 plain, 2 custard filled, 2 choco filled and 2 haupia filled. I noticed they were pulled from a box stamped with there logo so I'm hoping this is there recipe and creation. I would die if I ever came and was told there were no more, waahhhhh ! Employee pulled out a large tub of custard and injected the plain ones.   They were so delicious, I'm tempted to type the rest of this review in all CAPS. They were moist, chewy, fluffy and soft. After bringing them home and being kept in the fridge, we would nuke em' in the micro for 30 seconds and they were just HEAVEN. Not tough or rubbery at all. Knowing this has encouraged me to take home at least 2 dozen next time.   Though the dishes didn't make my mouth water, I'll be back for some Poke and A LOT more Malasadas!",

The restaurant itself is a little bit too causal, the decor looks like cafeteria, i think which is good for friends & family, but please, please dont take your date there lol.    We sat at the bar, ordering the dinner AYCU during lunch hours because for my love, such as sweet shrimps, uni, sashimi salad, other appetizers that we interested belongs to the dinner AYCU category.  Food is good fish is fresh, still worth the money.  I believe they have happy hour all day, which is $8 pp all you can drink either beer or hot sake.  Awesome deal right!

You got poke express which is a company set aside on its own . Then two more sections that is just island sushi . One side is mainly the fast hawaiian food and one that is more sit down with the AYCE sushi option.   They've got a happy hour I like to go to every Monday - Wednesday all day that is half off select rolls. I love the surf & turf! I can't not come here without eating it . The food is really yummy , however the real let down is how they lack in service . It is just so-so and sometimes irritating. Whenever I come to the sit down section I can always expect service to be slow and mediocre. Usually it takes a long time for them to refill drinks and take your order, esp if your an AYCE . There not rude or anything there just extremely slow , which is why it didn't get 5 stars.   The atmosphere is nice , it clean with two tvs on either side. It also has a sort of mini billboard on at each of the side tables that advertises local businesses .   I LOVE the Togo/fast food side of this place. It's so yummy , everything that I've gotten from there . I especially love the bentos , can never go wrong with those. If your looking to buy poke I suggest going to the poke express counter .

The chefs are great at creating dishes for those who are picky and recently they've added a weekly specials menu to their all you can eat. If you're looking for a great environment it's the place for you. Make sure you stop by between 1130 and 3 on Sundays and do their brunch. You're missing out if you don't.",

You can get meals to go from the front and the back is where they sell poke, and they have a separate room on the right for dining in.",

Looks run down and outdated which had me iffy about the place before .. But it was the closes sushi joint from the gym so I gave them a chance.  We ordered.. Puhi Maki Roll (daily special) - spicy soft shell crab, assorted fish on top with garlic ponzu sauce (Very Tasty!) Salmon Skin Handrolls - crispy salmon skin, just enough sauce and not too much rice wrapped in seaweed (DELICIOUS!) Raw Crab Poke - fiance got this, looked appetizing and plentiful but I wasn't daring enough to try it.. Eggplant Fries - crispy, sliced, battered eggplant came with Spicy Miso Sauce, which I think didn't really compliment it, but I'm one who doesn't really care for dipping sauces. Baked Salmon Roll - it was good but nothing special about it, loved that it didn't have so much rice nor cheese on top!  Tofu Poke - so simple, yet sooo good! Fried tofu in their poke sauce with onions! (SOOO GOOD! Lol) Malasada Sundae - the malasada (aka Hawaiian donut) tasted like cardboard, was dry and seemed like it's been sitting there for days.. Strawberries were sweet and the vanilla ice cream.. Was just ice cream.. Not a fan.  Sushi chefs were attentive but the waiters/waitresses were not.. Service was slow from the waiters, i.e. took almost an hour to get my eggplant fries.. Bit of a turn off..  Overall satisfied with my meal and will def come back for the salmon skin handroll and tofu poke!",

    "text": "1 star for the poke bar 1 star for the yummy dessert bar  1 star for the all you can eat sushi option  We went in early evening and they had 3 parties ahead of us. 2 tops and we were a 4 top (2 adults and 2 kids). We waited in their front room, the restaurant was behind a lil curtain in its own room. We waited for about 30min. A little too long for only being the 3rd party on the list and with at least 5 open tables in the restaurant. The lady who was sitting people had called another party before us but we stood up and said, we got here before them and we still haven't been seated. She gestured for us to go ahead inside as well. We walked in the restaurant and they had at least 5 tables open.   We did the AYCE and ordered our girls their own individual bowls of rice and a couple appetizers for their dinner. There was a lot of waiting in between, waters not being filled in a timely manner (we had to ask a couple times for refills), and our server forgot one of our orders but made it seem like they were still making it. It was well over 20min and we ordered another roll after the fact and still got that before the first one. Then he charged us for 2 kids AYCE when they didn't even touch any of the rolls, just what we ordered them individually. That was another 5 or so minutes waiting for them to adjust our bill. We spent 2.5hrs at the restaurant. Half the time was us waiting on their service. We ate our food pretty quick, at the most we were eating for an hour. The rest of the time was waiting to be seated, waiting to order after being seated, waiting for the food, waiting for the bill (we had been done for a good 10min and no one had brought us a bill, we had to ask them), and then waiting for them to correct our bill for over billing us.   The food is not that great to be receiving such a service. They look busy, but they just have 2 servers for the whole restaurant. At least that's what I had noticed. Maybe hire a couple more servers and you'd provide faster service instead of guests waiting and waiting. Definitely not going back to the restaurant. There's other AYCE sushi places with better service and better tasting food. I do like their poke bar though, quick and friendly service every time I went there.",

I cant normally come during the day when theyre open and i usually do take out.   I have tried the poke bar in the back and the gentlemen was super helpful. He let us sample a fee things before we decided, which made it even harder because everything was marinated so well. The seaweed salad was delicious and had just the right amount of seasoning.   When i order take out i usually get the take out bento box a with garlic chicken. Sessa i think her name is, simply awesome. Super friendly and has great customer service. This place really gives the aloha spirit.   I love the desserts that they have too. The butter mochi i had ordered last time was superb and tastes just like my aunties.

The variety, quality and service for an all you can eat sushi restaurant is what makes this a great find. The $28 for all you can eat is about what you would spend for a buffet but the variety of food including Kalbi, mochiko chicken and sushi makes this a great sushi experience. I do confess to having a sushi coma recently after visiting here.   Go and enjoy.",

My favorite part about this ayce is their appetizers. Dishes ranging from baked mussels to kalbi and hamachi kama are all so yummy.

They are so welcoming it feels like i'm home! Garlic chicken is so awesome. I always get the bento with the teriyaki beef and choice of chicken which would always be the garlic chicken. I share with my son all the time and he absolutely loves it. He never leaves me any noodles though :(  Now that they have poke express, I'm totally in love! Spicy ago combo is my ultimate fave poke! Their limu is good too. I'm just sad it's far from my house. Malasadas are yummy with the fillings. There are other desserts too. So good! A good 15 mins but it's so worth going there.  *sushi side* All you can eat is great, i always have the scallop mayo, i can't find it anywhere else and that really reminds me of back home. they also have really good sides!  service is always good",

Very accommodating with the 10 friends we had, started with a couple appetizers for everybody: spicy tuna with pickled daikon, ahi poke, baked mussels, garlic chicken, Kim chii fried rice, yaki soba, spicy raw crab (yummy), hamachi Kama, sashimi salad and that's just appetizers.   On to the Nigri sushi all fresh and perfectly made: hamachi, yellowtail, Cajun albacore, ebi, amaebi, salmon skin hand roll.....whole lotta goodness in just two entrees. For the grand sushi rolls we ordered the maKaha, big island, kahuku and more than we can't seem to remember due to being comatose.   Oh let me mind you that they do offer an AYCD on sake!!!  What?!?!?!  Yes all you can drink sake!!!!  Great food and get drunk, how can you complain. Let's not forget the dessert: 808 special!!!  So yum yum and you can even take some cocoa puffs.   Hard to find great sushi spots and we've grown to love this place.  Will definitely keep going back especially with the start of their punch cards. Auryte!!!!!",

I'm now an official fan of AYCE sushi, at least if it's from Island sushi! $24.95 is a steal for the quality you're getting.   Starters: The mini fried octupus was awesome.. as was the gyoza... as was the seaweed salad. All fresh and top knotch.   Sushi: The owner had flown in some kampachi for our event.. WOW I wish he would add this to the menu because it was out of this world. I also tried hamachi off the menu, it was fresh and tasty. Not a hint of fishyness. The deep fried philly roll was delish, as was the island roll, and to be honest every roll I tried. I didn't bite into anything mushy or fishy tasting.   I couldn't eat dessert.. I was much too stuffed from all the awesome sushi!! The owner was super nice, as was all the staff. I definitely recommend this as a great AYCE sushi spot!",

Menu is so simple and clean and extra delicious! The servers take time to explain and recommend different items and are so quick to clear empty plates and replenish drinks.

I wanted to give it another chance, and the second time was even more disappointing. I ordered their chicken katsu curry. I have only had chicken katsu curry with white chicken meat, and this was the first time I've ever had it with dark chicken meat. I simply don't like dark meat; the texture/taste put me off and there wasn't enough curry sauce for the entire meal. My friends ordered the bento with salmon and beef; both of them were extremely dry and they couldn't finish their meals either. I was hoping for better meals considering how many stars this got on Yelp",

    "text": "BEWARE of ordering off their CATERING menu. I paid $90 for a FULL tray of Teriyaki Beef. I ended up with a HALF tray of Teriyaki-4 lbs of cooked Teri Beef. Menu says it can feed 25-30 people. Definitely NOT TRUE. What they fail to tell you is the FULL tray of Teri Beef is half in height-in essence NOT a FULL tray of beef. What a total disappointment!!! I ordered for my daughters graduation party and did not have enough for all my guests.   Also, my order was picked up at 1030am. Shrya called me at 1130am to ask when I would be picking up my order? She said it was still there. Which leads me to believe they gave me the wrong order. I spoke to Lee and he didn't help matters.   So basically, DO NOT order any catering from them. It is a HUGE ripoff. I paid $90 for 4lbs of Teri Beef. Terrible Service and False advertising!  This is my reply to Owner-Terrence Fong seems like a good excuse to me. I missed Steve's phone call as I was hosting a graduation party and trying to figure out how I would make up for the shortage of Teri Beef.   It is a FACT that the tray was  NOT up to value. No where on the catering menu did it say \"Full Tray is 8lbs\". That to me equals-FALSE Advertising. I also purchased a FULL TRAY of Deluxe Noodles and guess what? That tray weighed a lot more than 8 lbs. What is your excuse for that?   I always try to support local businesses. But, how can I when this is he result. Very sad that you decided to respond this way instead of trying to making it right. AUWE! Clearly you are not in the habit of running your business with Aloha and respect for your customers.",

Once in awhile they would have coconut custard pie and that's pretty good.  The poke is excellent one of the best in the area.  The deft touch on the shoyu for the poke is on point not too salty  Back in town again. Just got ordered the hamburger steak and something is different.   The beef was super dry and this could have been a mistake?  Is there a vegan version of the hamburger steak?  It was like chewing a a piece of cardboard.  There was no grill flavor to it or even a crust.  Did the staff change?  It was not a busy night so there should not be an issue of time to prepare it properly.  Or is this a different beef supplier?  This caught me off guard on how this was a big miss.",

    "text": "The $27.95 AYCE was not worth it. The sushi was alright. Service wasn't awful, but the problem came up when I pointed out to our waitress that we hadn't received two of our sushi rolls. She argued saying I had only ordered one. I let it go and toward the end I ordered a brownie dessert that comes with the AYCE. All others at my table received their desserts except me. I waited for about 10-15 minutes before deciding it probably wasn't going to come out. I tried several times to get her attention and she clearly knew I was calling for her because we made eye contact several times.I had to go up to her at the servers station and ask how much longer it would be to which she replied, \"Oh, let me put it in for you now\". Clearly, she forgot to put the order in and I decided I was ready to leave. It's already a higher than usual set price for an AYCE to only receive half the items you ordered. The rest of the staff was great.",

    "text": "My roommate and I had eaten here a few times throughout the year, with some meals being on the edible side and some being less than worth the money (which is a gamble one has to take with sushi in Henderson in general).  Since it's closer to home and we both miss sushi (always hoping that it'll be one of the better days for Island), we hadn't sworn this place off just because some of the meals were more lackluster.  Their menu can seem attractive, and on their good days, their nigiri is on par with every other AYCE place in town.  I feel compelled to write this in light of how many days have been on the fence, with today's experience being the straw that breaks the camel's back. I don't have a high standard for sushi in Henderson, and being AYCE allows for some extra slack in terms of quality.  But even from our first plate of garlic tuna that had two slices of nigiri that were entirely destroyed-- they honestly looked like they'd been thrown in a blender and slapped on top of sushi rice.  The flavor that followed is what you would expect.  I couldn't guarantee that the fish was outright spoiled, but the flavor and texture for that and everything that followed (since you order all at once) resembled fish that had been subject to some incredibly questionable safe handling mishaps (being left out in the sun, being frozen and reheated multiple times) that turned my stomach.  As more items came and more required me swallowing something that made me nauseous, we eventually got to the point where it seemed not worth the risk of food poisoning (which, I don't know if the fish was truly spoiled.  It just tasted SO off and had the worst texture of literally any sushi I've ever had).  Because it's customary to pay for anything you don't eat for AYCE, we were still charged for opting out of getting food poisoning. Our server was fine, but she offered to pass along this information so that hopefully it's corrected for next time, but fool me once... We won't be returning, and it felt necessary to warn people of this risk of not only eating sushi that would be concerning for food poisoning and the lack of responsibility exhibited by Island for being willing to serve such questionable quality items (again, in the context of Henderson sushi that's already pretty sketchy to begin with), let alone to be charged full price and then some for refusing to eat that biohazard.",

I come here for the AYCE option as there are a ton of choices that range from your typical sushi to fusion rolls and dishes.  Come on Sunday to experience their brunch section which is also available on AYCE.  I was very surprised that we were allowed to pick from the brunch menu.  I originally thought it was one or the other.  The options on the brunch menu seem to bend more towards the Hawaiian flavors and are more creative.  Definitely try them though as a lot of these are not to be missed, especially the Kalua pork nachos!  Everybody is always in a good mood here and it is just a nice place to come and feel welcomed while stuffing your face with delicious fusion flavors!",

Tight at the bar though. Parking is plenty. Located in a plaza off of Eastern, it is semi busy in the area. Brings in good traffic. The inside of the restaurant is a bit cramed away from the bar. I believe about 9 tables total. Yes pretty small. Because of the small space, it gets pretty loud with a full house. Both times we were there it took about 5-10 minutes for us to get greeted, which is very rare. Customer service is good. Enough to where the Mrs. did not complain.  What ordered:  Albacore Hamachi Sake Super white Sweet shrimp Green mussels Seaweed salad Miso soup Sashimi salad Raw crab poke Ahi poke Softshell crab Fried tamper Hamachi kama Eggplant fries  Pauhana roll  Malassada sundae Green tea ic  More rice than fish. Nothing stuck out enough to write about, which makes this my most simple review yet. It's a good spot to go if your in the area and need a \"Smith's\" style sushi fix.",

There are two sides: sushi side and grill side, but it doesn't really matter because you can order from both menus either way. I love coming here for 50% off rolls Monday-Wednesday. Just don't forget to tip on the regular price! Service is great, but not perfect. Out of the 20+ times I've been in only a couple \"off\" days had happened. I recommend their garlic chicken on this side of town, poke avocado bowl, pau hana roll, kahuku roll, negihama roll, and big island roll. I have never had bad sushi here...ever! It gets even better, they have dessert! Yummy malasadas with various fillings, whole and individual cake slices (guava, haupia, dobash, and chantilly). Also, seasonal offerings such as pumpkin mochi! The new renovation looks great!",

    "text": "I was told by a friend that this place is THE PLACE to go to for loco moco. So why not try it out? There is spacious parking in this lot. Upon entering this establishment, I was a bit confused because there was a hawaiian restaurant in front of me and then a divider on the right which seemed like a sit down sushi restaurant. I guess it was two restaurants in one establishment. Anyways, I came for the loco moco. I ended up ordering the pulled pork loco moco and the chicken katsu. The lady who took our order in the front counter seemed overwhelmed as she was taking customer orders as well as phone orders. It didn't bother me so much that she was working hard, but it's nice to be in the moment with someone you're talking to.  When the food arrived, oh boy did it look good. All in all, it was okay. It didn't really hit the spot as my go-to hawaiian restaurant in LA. It was filling no doubt, but it felt a little bland. It definitely needed salt. The egg on the loco moco was overcooked. I never had pulled pork in my loco moco and I thought it was an interesting meat to add on, but I think the gravy needed to be more flavorful for me to really enjoy the meal.   The Hawaiian side of this restaurant is small with long table seating and maybe 3-4 booths. There are TVs to keep you company while you wait for your food. In all, this place is alright, but I know there are other Hawaiian restaurants in the area that I might want to visit prior to returning here.",

That's something that is hard to get around. But one thing that has always stuck with me in importance above everything else is customer service.   I'm not easy to deal with sometimes. Not because I have an attitude, but because I can be an annoyingly picky eater. For that reason, it is easy to see frustration and eye rolling in a situation where someone would have to press a couple extra buttons to modify an order in a job they don't exactly enjoy.  I can tell at least for a Kapua, Chase, and Gino, that this is not only a job they enjoy, but an atmosphere that has already made me feel welcome like family. They have already remembered me by name, they have went out of their way to make recommendations, check on myself and the friends I have brought with me, and have yet to make any visit any less than fantastic. The three of them have been an invaluable asset to the restauraunt and  instrumental factors regarding my three returns, and all the returns after this review that are to come.  Thank you for the fantastic food and fantastic service!",

We opted to sit down and were greeted with friendly and fast service as well as an extensive menu for fish and non-fish eaters. The AYCE option seem popular, but my husband choose the ahi avocado poke bowl (yum!!!) and I choose the teriyaki chicken combo, which is only $11 and comes with miso soup, a salad, edaname, chicken, rice, and dessert!!! And that dessert option is no joke! Tempura ice cream, green tea ice cream, mochi, sundae... I choose the creme brulee. Everything tasted great and the prices are reasonable.

They do have some interesting rolls, like teriyaki chicken, that are different than what you usually find on a sushi menu, but they didn't really peak my interest.The saketini's were good, they are served cold with interesting flavors like white peach and lychee. I stopped by the dessert case on my way out and regret not getting anything. They had guava and chantilly cakes that looked pretty delicious.

    "text": "It's not bad, not the best either.  I was going to meet a friend at another sushi spot nearby but when she got there she told me they were closed and open only at night.  I told her to drive further north towards my favorite intersection in LV (215/Eastern) because I've always wanted to try Sunday brunch at Island Sushi.  We both had all you can eat, we had dinner pricing because we wanted some of the dinner only items as well.  They have a special Sunday Brunch pupus menu and I pretty much ordered all of it.  The one item per person on the pupus menu, crab poke something, had a nice spice kick to it and it's basically a small crab cut in half with that spicy sauce.   I'm the unlimited mimosas champagne, I mean champion, and I had that here as well.  Keep it coming man, keep pouring it.  Unfortunately the restaurant was busy and so service was spotty.  Luckily we sat on the table at the far south east end so servers always passed us but even so, it was somewhat hard to get their attention.  But back to my mimosa, I started with the guava mimosa and it just didn't work.  I ended my next 6 refills with regular champagne.  The thick guava syrup was just too sweet and settled on the bottom of the glass.  So do come and try Island Sushi but Sunday brunch (gotta have a taste for their pupus section) is a definite must try.  I'll definitely be back.",

This place never disappoints and has some or most of the best Hawaiian/Local style dishes outside of Hawaii. On my recent visit, they have changed up the interior decor and the format of the restaurant flow. Not that it needed it but it does make for a nicer addition and updated area. They now make Poke Bowls and have a selection of ingredients that rival the best of places in Hawaii that do the same. Their Local food selection and plate lunch variations are incredible and mighty tasty! The staff here has the best attitude and really knows how to provide the best customer service. Nothing can beat the unlimited cuisine and creativity of Hawaii restaurants but thank you for existing here in Vegas because you make me miss Hawaii food less and less.",

    "text": "This review is based on purchasing poke in the back.  ***THIS PLACE IS NO LONGER POKE EXPRESS*** First off, shame on you guys for taking down the sign that Poke Express moved to a different location.  A lot of old customers does not know (including myself) that Poke Express is no longer there.  Walked in thinking it was still Poke Express.  Quality and Service was horrible.  I order some poke along with a side of rice.  My order was just sitting there while the lady behind the counter catered to new customers.  My order came out after my friends order (he ordered a poke bowl), which he had placed after me.  How hard is it to scoop some poke and rice then have a customer pay for the damn thing instead of just having it sit there? It took 20 minutes for me to get my order.  The lady (sorry), which looked and sound like a man had some major attitude.  No smile what so ever.  We're from LA and we always order a ton of poke to bring back home.  We ordered a ton of Poke to bring back home and felt robbed.   I found it \"fishy\" after tasting the quality of the poke and also the amount of time it took to get our order, that this was no longer Poke Express.  I had to yelp to find out they had moved.  Eventually went to the new location in which they had advise us Island Sushi took down their sign that they moved.  Basically taking over their business making it seem like it was still Poke Express without anyone knowing.  Shameful.  Please be aware and stay away!!!",

The buffet included your choice of appetizers, sushi, and a choice of dessert. The food was pretty good for the price. We ordered lots of nigiri, different styles of poke, and 2 rolls - a total of 35 dishes. I loved the unagi, while my hubby enjoyed the uni. We had the ahi, fried tofu, kimchee tako, and raw crab poke. I liked the fried tofu and ahi poke the best. The desserts weren't very good. We had tempura ice cream and 808 special. The tempura batter fell off the ice cream.   Service was great! Our waitress kept on coming back to our table to see if we wanted to order more food. I'm glad that we weren't ignored.   One minor grip was that this restaurant charged for green tea - $1.50 per person. I'm not used to paying for green tea.   You need a car to get to this place since it is really far from the Strip. I would come back here again.",

The sushi is small and the spider roll that i order had a really strong fishy taste to it which is not normal. So that really brought it down another star.  Service was not good at all. There were only two sushi chefs and not alot of people, it took forever for the sushi to come out. The waitresses didn't even come by once to fill our water or anything.

Ever since trying this joint out a couple years back, every trip to Vegas is not complete until we have a dinner at Island Sushi!  The staff is so friendly and attentive, the food tastes great, and the atmosphere just feels homey.  The latest time around, I decided to get only nigirizushi.  No rolls at all.  The menu for this AYCE is huge.  I had three rounds of several types of nigiri each round and still didn't make it thru the whole nigiri menu.  I didn't come across one I totally didn't like either.  Favorites would be the mackerel and the super white.  Oh so delicious.    They have a huge appetizer menu as well.  For appetizers be sure to get a couple orders of the baked green mussels.  They add a little extra spiciness to theirs that make them so tasty.  If I remember correctly (from past visits) the rolls are pretty decent sized aren't heavy handed on the rice.  I like how they don't try to stuff you up with extra rice on rolls or even the nigirizushi.  They truly allow you an all you can eat experience.  Nothing ends a meal like a great dessert (again a decent size for an AYCE).  Only one per person, and you can't mix and match so, be sure to get the 808 special and the green tea ice cream.  Then you can have the 808 special with green tea ice cream!  Can't have a trip to Vegas anymore without stopping by here at least once.  Thanks Island Sushi for the wonderful food and hospitality!",

Las Vegas is dubbed an honorary island due to \"Local Kine\" diaspora/migration to the desert, and as a result, we get lots of Hawaiian eateries in the valley. Yay! I personally do not like macaroni salad, deep-fried rolls, any roll that contains cream cheese, and sweet sauces. All these preferences go against many Americanized sushi and Hawaiian food protocol. Take my review with a grain of salt.   Their poke is delicious (at $10/lbs for takeout). Me and spicy food are like kindred spirits. I recommend the Lava Lover and Spicy Mexican. The standard Rainbow roll is tasty as well. The all-you-can-eat is a good deal, as long as you can grub until you burst. I love how the rolls aren't stuffed with rice like other places, but I don't like how many of the rolls are doused with this sweet sauce (miso? eel? ponzu? not sure) which was not pleasant and weird. Now only if they didn't forget my rolls, I would highly recommend it.",

I've never eatten at the Sushi restaurant, only at the Hawaiian food and Poke Express.  The Poke is really awesome.  If you like Tagu, it is sweet and chewy and very authentic.  The shou Poke and spicy poke is great also.  If you are a poke fan, do try Poke Express.  I usually get the Bento Box A with Garlic Chicken.  It is a huge meal with rice, Teri beef, garlic chicken, spam and noodles.  Very flavorful and filling.  My wife gets the tuna bowl.  That is huge also.  Great flavors with the tuna and rice.  They have Oxtail soup on Saturdays all day and after 600pm other days.  I like this and it's very authentic.  You combine the rice and ginger and green onions and you have a cornucopia of flavors and textures in that oxtail soup.  It has been the best I could find so far in Las Vegas.  I would pass on the Saiman.  The noodles are good, but the broth is not as flavorful as the other places I've tried in LV.    Overall, the go-to spot for Hawaiian food this side of town.",

    "text": "AWESOME. AMAZING. BEST experience I've ever had. I recently went to Island Sushi after sifting through dozens of sugg's on Yelp. I was in town with family for a tradeshow and NONE of us were disappointed. In fact, we all agreed we'd Yelp about how amazing this place was. The server was awesome. My cousin asked if they had a roll with strawberries and they didnt, but about 10 minutes later the owner and sushi chef cam and asked what she was looking for. He custom made a roll for her.  We were all doing the all you can eat (I highly recc it), so to go out of his way to make a special roll even though we weren't paying more for us--was way too generous and was the icing on the cake.  If you are in town, live in town and want AMAZING, fresh quality sushi, check this place out.",

Everything we ordered was tasty but the rolls had way too much sauce on them. I'm not sure what the name of the sauce is but it was the sweet sauce that's usually on unagi. I would have given this place 4 starsif they would just go easy on the sauce. A lot of the rolls seems very similar so I wish that they had more variety.",

We were served often and we almost never had to wait for drinks or more food. The recommendations of the waitress were right on and we had some of the best rolls we have ever had. I don't remember all of them( this was a couple of months ago), but I do remember the candy cane and the island roll. Fantastic. Also loved the garlic chicken. Most surprising was the creme brulee. My mom is a big creme brulee snob and enjoyed this so much she wouldn't even let me try it! And the atmosphere made me feel like I was back home in Hawaii and that is a big plus! Will be coming back here on every visit to Vegas!",

    "text": "I just found out about this restaurant about a week ago and I've already been there 3 times!  I obviously really enjoyed it!  The first time my boyfriend and i sat at the sushi bar for late night happy hour which is from 9-close.  Half priced rolls and 1.50 for beers! Even imports like sapporo. My Favorite roll that i had to go back for was the alaskan roll. They put ikura on top which is a delicious twist.  So we ordered 4 rolls and my boyfriend had a beer and our bill was $20.  unbeatable price.  The sushi is good, and even really good for a local joint,  but i give it four stars b/c quality wise, it cant compete with places like nobu. The second time we tried out the grill part of the restaurant.  We ordered the saimen combo with garlic chicken and loco moco.  The loco moco was awesome.  The saimen, was so so, i've had a lot better.  The garlic chicken was also delicious.   The 3rd time we went back for the sushi happy hour and it was great.  We started with the tuna poke and miso soup, both very good.  Four sushi rolls and 3 beers.  The bill was thirty something dollars.   We will definitely go back if we are craving affordable sushi and dont feel like driving to the strip, but its not the best quality of sushi.",

The AYCE includes the awesomely delicious ahi poki, which to me alone is worth the trip (it's a bit far from our side of town). The baby tako were very yummy, too! The rolls were tasty and we ordered a LOT- to the point that I think our chef got frustrated, as we saw him walk off with a sour expression & another chef meekly replaced him. The rainbow roll was disappointing as others have said, but overall the food was tasty & the drink specials were great. Worth trying, and I'd like to go back soon~",

We often go to Poke Express and get their Poke Bowl, which is amazing, but my husband and I wanted to go out to sushi for our date night and decided to give Island Sushi and Grill a shot.  We were not disappointed at all, and it surpassed any expectation I had.  The staff was so incredibly nice and helpful.  They also were attentive and made sure everyone was taken care of.  Their wasn't an open seat in the place and I didn't feel that they were rushed or too busy for us (unlike other sushi places were you get your one order in and then your lucky to get ahold of the staff prior to getting your bill).  Another part I really liked was the way their seats are spread out.  It isn't a huge place, but I didn't have to share any elbow space with the table next to me.  Another big plus compared to other places.  We will definitely be back again!",

All the sushi we got was fresh and you can taste and feel the freshness. The vibe was really nice, with smooth reggae playing around. The staff was really nice. Our waitress was so nice we talked and asked questions and she was great all around. After stuffing our faces with sushi we got the 808 special. And usually when you get all you can eat they give you a piece of mochi cut in half or a sad excuse of a scoop of ice cream but the 808 special was a satisfying scoop of ice cream, tempura bananas, fresh strawberries, heap of whipped cream, and chocolate drizzle and it was perfection. The perfect end to a perfect dinner. with my drink my total was $28 which is completely reasonable. PS, when you buy 2 AYCE you get free sake. I don't know if it was everyday but it was nice.",

    "text": "This is by far MY FAVORITE AYCE sushi place!  It's not that close to the Las Vegas Strip, but driving here is totally worth it.  Upon entering, the first section you're in is their bake shop where you can order malasadas and wonderful treats like cocoa puffs.  To the right is the main dining area.  You can choose to order a la carte style or AYCE.  From their regular menu, we ordered their garlic chicken, mochiko chicken, and fried noodles.  ALL TASTED GREAAAAT!  From their sushi menu, we ordered ahi poke (tuna), tako poke (octopus), ebi (shrimp), ika (squid), masago (smelt roe), unagi (fresh water eel), amaebi (sweet shrimp), and their uni (sea urchin).  We also ordered a few specialty rolls.  All were very good and fresh!  Just writing this review makes me want to drive 4 hours just to eat here!  Okay, back to their review.  Their friendly staff did a great job in making sure we had enough food and when we would place an order, the food came out fresh and quick.  This AYCE isn't your typical buffet where you get up and serve yourself.  Your server comes around and you would inform them what menu item you'd like to order.  Simple as that!  When the place gets extremely busy, they have a 90 min. time limit.  The rules are noted on each table.  However when we were there, it was pretty packed and we stayed their longer than 90 minutes.  I guess they don't want you to practically live there and live off of their awesome food.  Also, they don't like it when you waste their awesome sushi.  So order accordingly.  It's an AYCE, so pace yourself.  DO NOT ORDER RICE OR ELSE YOU WILL GET FULL FAST!  For each person, it's about $24.  Don't come here expecting to eat crab legs all day.  For $24, that is a VERY good deal for fresh and great tasting sushi.  Their AYCE menu is extensive.  Did I mention that their mochiko and garlic chicken are both delicious?  I will most definitely eat here again.",

    "text": "HORRIBLE SERVICE.  My group waited 10 minutes to get seated when there empty tables available and the three servers walking around got the orders from everyone around us and didn't bother to ask if we wanted to order anything.  When they finally did, it took them near 20 minutes to get our first sushi orders to us.  I'm no sushi chef and I understand the restaurant gets a bit busy, but when all three servers are busy chatting away with everyone else and forgets to bring you the order you've been waiting for, 20 minutes is quite a long time to be waiting for a few sushi rolls.  Plus, the sushi rolls weren't even cut correctly and fell apart in a mess when we tried to eat the sushi.  After the first round of sushi, they asked once if we needed more sushi (and we said yes due to the pending 8 more sushi we ordered) and despite our long list of ordered sushi, it took about 30 minutes for one of the servers to come by and take our order again.  By this time I had lost my appetite and decided to pay the bill before I became even more pissed off due to their incompetence.  I'm from Hawai'i and when I saw 'Island Sushi' decided to stop in and check this place out, I really thought I would get that local island hospitality.  The only hospitality I got was \"Oh, sorry ah\" when they realized they forgot our table orders half and hour later.  Bad service and I definitely recommend this place if you're into spending your hard earned cash by sitting around and looking at other people eat.",

Also, I ordered teryaki chicken to go for my fiance. It took about an 45 min- hour to receive it. Our original waitress never checked  back with me about it. Finally a waiter came by so I could ask him why my togo order was taking so long. Finally a 3rd waitress brought it, no apology. My fiance thought the chicken was good but not teryaki sauce with it. If service was better, id consider going back.",

    "text": "I'm very disappointed since the majority of the reviews of this place are great. I'm thinking maybe employees (or people who know them) are writing reviews on this place. My boyfriend is obsessed with AYCES so we've been to A LOT of places in Vegas. I would like to think I knew what I was talking about. The menu was so small, I couldn't believe it. Especially since so many reviews are saying what a big selection they have. I don't like the fact that they don't have pictures of the rolls on their menu. I would like to see what I'm ordering. I personally don't eat raw fish so I like to order rolls that are baked or fried. Not one single item was like that. The menu does say baked and fried but they just cook the stuff on top so the rice is still cold. My boyfriend loves albacore tuna. We went at lunch time and they didn't have it so we had to pay dinner prices to get what we came for. He didn't like it at all. He said that the fish was room temperature. I thought that the shrimp and the unagi were fishy. The rolls were nothing special at all. I did like the fact that they were relatively bite size. Some places we go to they cut their rolls so big I have to struggle to get the darn thing in my mouth. My biggest complaint, only one desert per person. The whole reason I go to anything all you can eat is so I can get lots of desert. Luckily my boyfriend doesn't eat sweets too much so I got his. I absolutely love mochi but I didn't get any because the only flavors to choose from were strawberry and mango. I'm a vanilla and chocolate kind of girl. Maybe we'll come here for Hawaiian one day but we will definitely NOT be back for sushi.",

Everything else on the menu is A-OK, and so is the poke.  It isn't anything to rave about, but I do make do since I can't have it fresh like home.    On the sushi side, it's bueno! I think it's just me, but I love how the rice is.  It isn't too sticky or moist, it's just right.  Also, a keynote when ordering get the deep fried gesu.  OMG! It's amazing, especially with their mayo sauce.  It just makes everything taste better! I tend to think that the sashimi tastes better on sushi, so if you're craving raw fish.  Go for their sushi, it tastes a heck of a lot better.   Being from the Island, I say go here if you're craving the island food. It does live up to par, I just wish the poke came right from the ocean. Vegas needs a beach, so we can get a fish fresh!",

I felt like I was dealing with a crazy person.   the menu is pretty lackluster too.  once you order all you can eat, about 1/3rd the menu becomes off limits (not included in all you can eat) .",

They adapted to our screaming child who refused to go to sleep.  They have a 90 min. time limit on the AYCE part, which sucks.  But I can see why they do that since the place is pretty small.    Their ahi poke was yummy.  My hubby couldn't stop eating it!  I ate more than him and our other guy friend.  I ordered the tempura ice cream for dessert.

They also did not include my chicken katsu sauce. When I called I spoke to the manager named Angie & she was helpful but she said she had to talk to the kitchen manager.  The kitchen manager told her that I would have to bring the items back for her to look at it and determine if it was made up to standard or not. Are they seriously crazy that I would drive back just for them to look at the order!!! Is she really that insane to think that I would lie about something like that?!?  Unacceptable!!!  Obviously this kitchen manager was not in the business for a long time because this is unacceptable to treat your customers this way!!

Ive eaten at the sushi side a couple of times and just as it was before the service was eeeh ok at best, i expected better and faster service since its not always full capacity when we go.  I really enjoyed the extra pupus that you can order, my favorite was the \"seared garlic-peppered ahi belly\" that was the best thing on there, but the only bad thing was that it was limit one order per person, so i recommend getting that as one of the last of your sushi orders, my favorite dessert from the pupu menu was their small slush or ice cream float shot, the one on the menu this time as the green apple slush float shot, it was very very good i got a brain freeze after downing a couple lol. The rest of the menu was just ok nothing really special.  For the grill side i always used to drive 8 miles just to get their bento or malasadas, pretty far drive just for some food but its worth it when i have the Hawaii food craving, i don't go there much anymore since i always hit up the IslandbreezeLV truck which is almost always closer to me than Island Sushi.",

    "text": "I love Poke Express here, and also the grill for takeout has excellent service.  But, we received such poor service in the restaurant, we won't be going there again.  We were seated quickly and our drink orders were taken immediately by a very friendly gentleman.  We gave our order to the waitress.  We didn't want AYCE, so maybe we weren't worth her time.  Half our order came within 5 minutes.  The other half came 45 mins later.  A couple was seated 15 minutes AFTER us, got their food, ate, paid their bill and left before we received the rest of our order.  It was mochiko chicken, and other than being a little overcooked, it was delicious.  We then waited another 20 min after completely finishing our meal for our waitress to come back and get our order for dessert (which was included in the price of the meal I ordered) There were only 4 other tables occupied at this point....and at least 2 other wait staff.  This was a very insulting experience.  I can understand mistakes when a waitress is very busy, but being obviously ignored when she only had one other table was just too much.  I skipped dessert and just got the check.  To his credit, the man who took our drink orders ran to get us malasadas to go, which is the only reason I'm giving 2 stars.  Our waitress was nowhere to be seen and didn't apologize for the poor service once.  We spent nearly 2 hours there, and she spoke to us a total of 4 times.  I'll stick to the grill and Poke Express after this.  Unless we decide on AYCE, since that seems to be the only way to get service in the restaurant.",

My fiance and I ate by the sushi bar and based off the random rolls and nigiri pieces we picked out, I thought this place was \"ok\" as I judge my sushi by quality over quantity. (Though, I will say, it is expected that quality does go slightly down in an AYCE sushi place compared on one that isn't AYCE so my opinion might not be too fair.)  Finishing off my meal with the 808 dessert was quite a treat. The service didn't stand out to me and the inside of the restaurant doesn't appear to be anything special either.   On one last note, I do order breakfast with Island Sushi more frequently than I do sushi and love their menu. I usually order a two egg plate and malasadas. Their malasadas are made to order. I thought their malasadas are \"ok\" as well; it tastes too dense for me and the custard filled one kinda tastes like instant jello pudding mix.",

I appreciated the digital frames at tables near wall that flashed photos of food and patrons.  Servers were friendly but we were neglected as soon as it got busy and they forgot a few things we ordered. This maybe a problem for people since there is a 90min limit on AYCE sushi.     Now for the food:  Ahi Poke, 5 Star Fresh tasting with good color.   Garlic Chicken, 5 Star Juicy and flavorful.   Macaroni Salad, 1 Star It was too salty and eggy for my taste.  Fried Oysters, 2.5 Star On the burnt side losing the taste of the oyster. See my pic.  Sushi (Variety), 2.5 Star The taste and fresh color of the fish was not there, the presentation looked slapped together, rushed and mushy. Blah.  808 Special, 2.5 Star Nothing too special about a fried banana, vanilla ice cream, whip cream. It was just bland.  Malasada Sundae, 2.5 Star The malasada tasted old and hard. Vanilla ice cream and whip cream didn't do anything for it, either. Bland.  The drinks were on the bigger side which does not merit stars but definitely appreciated.    I don't have a reason to come back.",

I had their Malasadas for the first time today, super light and fluffy. Not too sweet. They are tasty except there was a slight odd aftertaste to them, can't quite explain it.   The prices are very reasonable.   The establishment could be in a better lot location, since parking space is a little tight if you have a large vehicle/truck.  Most of the staff members are helpful and friendly. There is seating for the sushi diners and grill diners. You can dine in, take it to-go, or order and pick up! Whenever I come here, there's always a considerable amount of customers and a wait time which is a good sign - people like it, hence they go here.   If you're around the Silverado Ranch area and want some good Sushi or Hawaiian food, go here!",

I'm so confused at what I just paid for. Oh, I know: Rice and Sysco MAYONNAISE. There was ZERO flavor here, and frankly, the temperature of the fish was disconcerting. Don't waste your money or risk your health.   In response to Terrance: You seem confused. Did you read my review?? I said your sushi was *COVERED* in mayonnaise and sauces. How is that protecting the \"integrity\" of your fish? I couldn't even taste the fish! All I could taste was that it was cheap quality and warm. Yuck. Go to Sushi Mon and see what a real, quality standard sushi place looks and tastes like.",

He was attentive and after telling him that it was our first time there, he ordered some of the most popular appetizers and rolls for us to try. They were all terrific!  FOOD While our server was super amazing, kitchen people were super slow. We waited over 30 minutes for our sushi. Yes I understand the place was packed but I've never waited that long at a sushi place. I was surprised to see that for AYCE, you only get 90 minutes limit. LOL are you kidding me. Half the time is spent waiting for food. Anyways, appetizers were good but sushi was ok. Some of my favorites were:  -Poke Roll -Garlic chicken (must try) -Salad (pieces of tuna and salmon in it. It was delicious!) -Joe's special  I felt like some of the sushi weren't that fresh. Having raised in Japan, I've had some good sushi and know what fresh sushi taste like-this wasn't it.  CONCLUSION Not the best but not the worst either. If you are not willing to wait 30 minutes for some sushi, I suggest Makinos for no wait & fresh sushi!",

The poke counter has a lot of choices, even if they run out in the evening they can make you some if you ask.  The poke is good and fresh and very similar to what we would get in Oahu. The sushi side is good as well, they do AYCE and also have a good brunch. You should also check out the desserts, they got pretty good malasadas and mochi. Definitely worth a try.",

    "text": "Needed my \"fix\" for some local grindz while in Vegas and chose Island Sushi & Grill because of the favorable ratings on Yelp.  Drove 16 miles (32 roundtrip) from DTLV out to ISG just to satisfy my yearning.  For the most part I wasn't disappointed, but I wasn't \"overly\" impressed.    It's a relatively clean place, but reminiscent of a local hole-in-the-wall diner back in the 808 - similar seats, stools, tables and floors.  Dine-in customers are still provided their meals in takeout containers, so that was a bit of a surprise. Typical local style, riiight?  Luckily the transplanted \"Hawaiian\" community hankering for island flavors are probably keeping this place open and in business.    I had the regular loco moco and my cousin had the poke chirashi. I love the fact that they make their own hamburger patties as the flavor was very good. The gravy was not generic and a nice change from what one might get at L&L. The mac salad was actually potato/mac, which anyone from the 808 would notice off the bat, so that was a nice distinction.    The poke bowl my cousin had was excellent. But, for the amount of poke provided it was priced maybe $2 more than it should have been.  It was good poke, no doubt...buuut, maybe a slightly bigger bowl for that price. This is why I won't eat at Tanioka's or Yama's Fish Market back on Oahu...  So why not 5 stars? Aside from the ambience (SO retro-local), it was the service we received...  Sorry.  Maybe because I'm in the service industry, but the staff - who look like kids of transplanted islanders - could perhaps meet/greet customers in a more friendlier tone and be a smidge more attentively as well.  It was taking a while for my plate, so I went back to the register and lo and behold, 3 workers chichatting in the kitchen about something with my order just sitting there. When one of them noticed me, he asked my name (???). WOW, how genius...we were the only ones in there - aside for some private party in the adjoining room.   Anyways, aside from service and price, this is a good place for local Hawaiians needing their 808 food fix.  Try it and enjoy...",

Cashier/server Shyra just dropped the food on our table and left in a rush after we waited for a long time. Then I wanted to try something from their bakery so I asked her what she would recommend. And she replied,\"Oh, I don't eat the pastries here\" Then I finally bought the custard pie and asked her if she could slice it and also give me some plates so I could eat it. She took the box, left it on the counter, and totally ignored me. After standing there for a long time, I decided to call the manager who then sliced the pie but I was so pissed that I just took the pie home. Please tell me you're gonna do something about your employee Shyra. She was very rude and need to have some manners.",

I do love that they have many Hawaiian dishes and styled sushi!",

The key is to go late at night so that parking and getting a table is pretty easy.   I love the ayce offerings. Its pretty much everything on the menu, including the daily specials. The only items it doesn't allow is sashimi. You can get soups, salads, appetizers, sushi rolls, entrees, and desserts. There is no way you can leave here hungry!  My favorite items are the garlic edamame, 007, and mona loa. Today they also had an apple cobbler for dessert which was fantastic!   The service is always wonderful and you can tell they genuinely want to see you satisfied and happy. Definitely recommend checking this place out...YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!",

Anyways you all know already food, sushi, drinks always great,and consistent, and why I was confident ISAG would not disappoint my friends. And awesome service as well! I think there were up to 15 or more, all I know is we took up that whole section along the wall.  The servers handled our crazy group beautifully. I won't hesitate to book our next get together again. Hopefully they'll ease up on the cc policy though.",

The restaurant is separated in two, one side is the sushi bar and the other is for the local food.  Food & service was great. Everything we ordered was tasty, so tasty that we ordered seconds of some of the same foods. My favorite was the eggplant fries & super white tuna. Soooo good. One thing I like about this place is they have tobiko! Some sushi spots only have masago so I was excited to have it here.   Not to mention they have happy hour on drinks during lunch time so feel to treat yourself! All you can eat also includes the desserts which is limited to two per person.   The only thing different about lunch is some of sushi rolls on the menu are not available. So it will be worth it to go back for dinner time!   Definitely will be back to try their local island food :)",

You can stay in the room that one first enters and order takeout. Cooked Hawaiian in the front, and poke in the back. Or if one chooses to eat in and have sushi, with a more complex meal, the room to the left allows you to be seated and eat there. Food is excellent for both though, the raw fish whether ordering poke or sushi is amazing for both parts of the restaurant, along with bento boxes. Spam is cooked to perfection, rice is amazing, along with sear on the bulgogi beef and spicy chicken. Been coming here all these years for a reason.",

    "text": "I'm a born and raised Hawaii girl and to my surprise this place was not how I expected. If you're gonna open a place that is supposed to be Hawaiian style start off by hiring workers who know what Aloha is. Seems like they have a lot of different things going on in this place and I didn't even know where to stand. My friend, his 1 year old daughter and I went in to the restaurant and our hostess/server walked us to a table and didn't even bother bringing us menus for over 5 minutes. When our server came around she let us know that AYCE sushi is $21.99 and asked us if the baby will be eating, (??? Of course she is???) and that they'd have to charge half amount if she eats some of the sushi. We decided to just order her a plate on the side since she obviously isn't going to be eating that much to begin with. Their rolls come out loaded with rice so that you get full and they can charge you extra for leftovers. Any time we needed something, it looked like we were such a bother to the servers when it wasn't even busy and there were 6 of them standing chatting on the side. In the end, we were full and decided to just pay the extra for the leftovers so I asked for a to go box to take home the rest of our food and our server walks back and forth asking what I'm assuming is her manager how much to charge for our leftovers and then if it's extra to take it home. If we're paying for the leftovers I don't understand why we wouldn't be able to just take it home. Well, our server came back and told us we can take our leftovers home, dropped our check and walked away with no thank you what so ever and nobody even said anything to us on the way out either. The food was okay but the service kind of ruins everything here.",

    "text": "I've been hitting up Island Sushi for years prior to the Yelp career.  It's time to show some Yelp love.  I'm yelping in regards to the AYCE sushi while sitting at the sushi bar..  Service: I've hit up their ayce sushi bar for Sunday brunch, weekend and weekday nights. The staff has always been GREAT! I'll usually sit at the sushi bar and the chefs are all cool but I want to give a shout out to Juan.  He's a great sushi chef who is friendly and is quick with getting your order out.  THe wait staff is awesome with keeping the bottomless mimosas or beers coming which I'll usually pair up with the ayce sushi.  There's a TV and they'll change the channel to the games you request as you throw down ayce and bottomless booze.  AYCE Sushi:  The Nigiri is always on point and I've never had a bad experience.  Everything we order is great but these are my favs: Yuzu Yellowtail, Salmon, Super White Tuna, Squid and the Garlic Tuna.  The Mount Charleston is bomb: California roll smothered with Spicy baked scallops and eel sauce.  Nigiri game is strong af here, everything is solid.  Ambiance: There's two parts to Island Sushi:  Pick up window dining and sit-down restaurant dining.  The Sushi Bar is in the Sit down restaurant which is directly to your right after you enter the Pick Up dining area.  The restaurant area is small and they pack a lot of tables so it's going to be noisy but nothing to derail from the dining experience.  This is my go to casual AYCE sushi joint.  Staff, service and the sushi has never failed me and I appreciate the consistency throughout the years.  It always seems to be crowded with regulars which is a testament to their performance so waits for parties of 5+ can occur.  However, if the sushi bar is empty, it's an easy sit down with no wait.  Keep up the great work Island Sushi, Mahalo! =)",

    "text": "Review for the grill side only.   I've been eating here for over 6 years now and I still haven't written a review for them?! What is wrong with me? I was first introduced to this place when my old roommate brought home their oxtail soup. Immediately then, I was hooked. I knew from then on, if the oxtail soup was good, everything else would be good.   So one side of the restaurant is a a sit down sushi joint while the other side is a grill making delicious Hawaiian fare. Like I said, I'll be writing about the grill side. They have large portions, enough to have leftovers the next day. Everything is cooked fresh. They have a display of desserts which include malasadas, chantilly cake, guava cake, mochi and other ono Hawaiian desserts. There is also a small poke counter to order freshly prepared fish. I have tried almost everything on the menu, and nothing has disappointed me. I do have my go-to favorites though...  Oxtail Soup: this is my #1 pick when eating here. The broth is rich and deep in flavor. The meat is fall-off-the-bone tender. They give you huge pieces of meat and 2 big scoops of rice. The ginger and garlic are on the side so you are able to customize your broth. Such a filling meal and very satisfying in the winter months.   Ahi Avocado Bowl: When I'm in need of a \"skinny-person\" meal, this is it. Although it's not really a skinny person meal because the bowl is absolutely huge. The fish is fresh. The avocados and a richness to the fish and rice. The cucumbers add that refreshing crunch. Plus it's extra delish if you add some soy sauce and sriracha on there.   Katsu Chicken: who doesn't love perfectly crunchy katsu?  That's exactly what this is! It's fried fresh. The chicken is juicy but not at all oily.   I can go on and on and name a few more delicious dishes like kalbi beef plate and a bowl of saimin, but I'm don't want to bore you.   Seating is limited, so try to come during non peak meal times or take it to-go. No matter, just come here and get your grub on. I think I'm going to get this for lunch tomorrow!",

The restaurant is separated into two areas: a section for plate lunches/poke and another section for sushi. Their menu contains a large selection of sushi rolls, poke, and island dishes to choose from. My all time favorite is the garlic chicken. I can never get tired of ordering it.  Since we were on this side of town today, my boyfriend and I decided to stop in for lunch. The second we walked through the door, we were immediately greeted by the friendly staff. My boyfriend ordered the fried noodle combo with mochiko chicken and I ordered the mini garlic chicken. Both plates came with a side of mac salad. The food was made fresh to order and it came out quick. The garlic chicken and mochiko chicken were crispy and extremely flavorful. The portions are huge (even with the mini plate I ordered) and the prices are reasonable. We had to bring our leftovers home. In addition, they have a variety of desserts that looked good but we were just too full to get any. My boyfriend and I love coming here and we will continue to come back. I highly recommend this place!",

The restaurant is divided into two areas, the sushi restaurant, and the Hawaiian food/poke section. We got a little bit of everything- poke, ox tail soup, beef teriyaki plate, malasadas, spam musubi. Everything tasted so good, food came out hot and fresh, poke was fatty and soft. I really have no complaints, and pricing was great too!",

    "text": "It was my first time going to Island Sushi today. First thing I noticed was the place is somewhat divided into two parts. For AYCE, you have to wait to be seated. We didn't wait very long and was seated right away which is a plus (; When it comes to ordering sushi you would have to write out the quantity on a piece of paper. And the servers would have to take your side dishes. It somewhat took them awhile to take our orders but compare to other sushi places our food came in pretty fast. Some rolls were put on the same plate and it got confusing which one is which. We asked the manager (since he served our food) and he explained in detailed. One of the servers forgot our dessert though & they already handed out our bill. We did let the manager know & they still served it to us.   I would totally recommend this place. $21 for AYCE here is definitely worth it.",

I was here during the 2010 New Year's weekend and looking to avoid the strip since there are a lot of people in town celebrating the New Year.  So decided to look into my trusted Yelp iPhone app and with a high rating of this place, I know I can't go wrong.  So I took the wife and kids and we went along with what was recommended, \"ALL YOU CAN EAT SUSHI\" for $24.95!!!  Just two servings of the AHI POKI pays for it self already, and that's just the appetizer.  I would also recommend Joe's Special roll, Ahi Fever, and the Island Special roll.    As for the kids, we were able to make it there before 5 PM so they had their usual California roll (my boys are 3 and 5 and already eating sushi!) and some Ebi sashimi.  After the meal we treated ourselves with some Malasada to go.  Good for kids and has a lot of parking.  The only complaint (reason I didn't give them a 5 star) was service, the waitress forgot some of my wife's order and ended up making the entire order again, but no problem since it was AYCE, it was all good for my tummy!",

But when you're as big of a sushi glutton as I am, you've tried it already and know it isn't very good or very fresh. Most places are run by indifferent Chinese or Korean people who just want to give you whatever can pass for sushi and then charge you as much as they can for it, or deep fry everything to mask the fact that none of the fish is very fresh.  Island Sushi is different. As far as I can tell, everything was nice and fresh, service was good, the appetizers were amazing (thus providing a more diversified AYCE experience than just eating roll after roll), and of course they still have to cut their losses somehow so there is a 90 minute time limit which I am totally okay with.  We stumbled out of this place satisfied and not feeling cheated, and went off to digest while firing AK47s at the Gun Store. Perfect day! :)",

The sushi rolls are made to order and super fresh. He Kalbi short ribs, garlic chicken and gyozas are amazing. Don't forget to order all you can eat dessert as well. My go to is the Malayalam sundae or the tempura fried banana with ice cream. There is an amazing oxtail soup that is separate from the all you can eat menu hat is a must order as well.

I do enjoy this place greatly for Hawaiian food, and it is probably the best in Las Vegas. the Plaza location is way better in though as far as consistency goes. I suggest going there if you want a larger variety of food along with tastier flavors.  The sushi here is sub par to the other sushi restaurants in Las Vegas. Definitely come here for the Hawaiian food and the tuna poke bar though (I will review this as well). It is worth a shot!",

This time we sat at the tables and not 1 employee out of probably 6 didn't even acknowledge us. We stood there for a solid 8 mins with no word from any employee!   After we got seated, took another 10 mins for our waitress to come to the table. She finally came over took our orders for all you can eat. My husband only likes California rolls and is from Maryland and loves crab! The crab was so filled with mayo it was terrible! We ended up eating everything cause we were starved besides maybe 3 pieces of one of my rolls that had imitation crab in it. I picked around it.   Server came back and said she would charge us $2 each piece because everything needs to be consumed not just parts of it. Listen I get it, but when it's full of mayo and doesn't taste good (which I told the server) you should prob just take the $6 off the bill as a gesture and not try and argue with us. The female \"manager\" came back with our check (which had the $6 charge on it) and said there's nothing she can do because it's the owners who implement that rule. My husband and I both work in hospitality and thinks it's crazy that not only wouldn't she take off the charge she laugh at us! At that point I couldn't even talk I had to walk out and left my husband to just pay the check and leave.  It was definitely our fault for not saying something about the taste of the crab in the first place.. But everything that happened tonight I will never go back and I will make sure to tell my friends about what poor \"laughing\" customer service they provide. Well you got your $6 bucks! Hope it was worth it versus having repeat customers. I will be taking my business elsewhere. I advice...hire new staff.",

They don't seem happy or helpful that your there. Opened the door and there's two rooms one for sushi and the other for Hawaiian food? We stood there waiting cause there was a wait to be seated sign didn't wait long but anything more then a min. Makes no sense you just feel like your being ignored its Monday at 530 maybe two tables were sat in the whole place. We finally sat got waters and waited for our delicious food to arrive. Must say everything we tried was the best very happy about that. Again just the overall friendliness with the staff and we had like three or four people help us? Wasn't sure who to ask for what but all helped us. Get the poke any roll and defiantly the creme' brula it's small but oh so good.",

We chose to eat at the bar so my companion could see the sushi cooks do there thing. It was her 1st time and are guide, sushi cook Jesus didn't let us down. He took us on a guided journey through the world of \"Island Sushi\" and all its tastes and flavors. We had both hot and cold saki. We tried both of their Japanese beer selections. We chose the all you can eat menu, and that we did. We ate spider rolls, spicy tuna, fried oysters, tempura shrimp, mussels, soft shell crab, mochi, tempura ice cream and my personal favorite the Kahlua pork tacos. We ate more but I dont have the space here to list all of our nights conquests. Needless to say we weren't hungry when we left. The food was amazing but the service was even better. The attention Jesus gave to me and my companion, even speaking to her in Spanish was above and beyond. He made us laugh he made us happy. We met the manager who stepped in and gave me the recommendation of the night, the Kahlua pork tacos. I just can't say enough about this place and the prices were very reasonable. Ill definitely be back for some more Island Sushi.",

It's fun to come here. Today I discovered that I was the only customer not wearing flip flops. The service is great; everyone there works hard, but Mac and Chuy are always at their best. Monday is Happy Hour all day and rolls are half price. 5 rolls, one big Sapporo and a couple of malasadas are a great meal  for 2 and won't put a hole in your wallet. All of the rolls are great; just tried the Spicy Mexican and Kilauea and loved them both! We'll be back.",

The chicken that was used I believe was left over Mochiko chicken from days ago that was very hard and dried out.  Lots of the pieces was all black on the outside.  Very disappointed!  When I first opened the plate box, you could see the chicken was all old and dried looking but I decided to not pre-judge before tasting but my first impression was confirmed when I first sticked my fork in the chicken.  Very tough!  Even with a knife it was still tough.    Overall the quality is a hit and miss.  I recommend if ordering take out, please take the time to open the box and see what your order looks like so you can at least make your comments while you are still there.",

    "text": "Ok. Can't be nice right now. Very bad representation of this restaurant. And come on guys, I recommend that everyone eats here. I am obsessed with your restaurant. But today my friend Lisa and I had the displeasure of being served by Mila and I have to say something about it. We were coming to get some sushi. Decided to do all you can eat and heard about all you can drink for $10. Awesome deal. We are both full time business women and wanted to unwind with a few beers and some good food. Mila explained that it's $10 all you can eat sake and beer. Cool. Then she later corrected that they are individual charges. We said fine, Lisa would get the beer and I'd get the sake. We could have it all! Mila corrected us, which was fine. That's her job. But being in the customer service industry, I welcome all feedback and use it as growth to improve every customers time in my store, and decided to tell Mila that I would appreciate if she could just give the feedback to the restaurant management that I feel it should be interchangeable. Just like getting all you can eat and sharing the rolls, getting all you can drink should follow the same structure. * if both parties are paying, then why not?*   She seemed to think my feedback was more funny than valuable, and proceeded to point at a table in the corner and say \"well they are all sitting over there, so-\" as if I wanted to stop my lunch to go relay the message.   All she would have have to do is say \"thank you for that feedback, I will make sure they hear it\".   From then on I just began to lose my desire to be there. Listen, all you can drink is a great idea, in an atmosphere where you facilitate an environment where people feel valued and welcomed. Mila sadly had a poor attitude the rest of our visit and did very routine \"check ins\" but obviously was following a script vs. any kind of genuine interest in our satisfaction as customers.   We were the only ones there too, and Mila kept going to the other table (the table full of the owners and managers) it made us feel like we were being talked about and it created less of a welcoming atmosphere. Remember, perception is reality. So be aware of your customers.   I'm so bummed about this experience. It was my friends first time here and I feel she had a very bad impression of what this restaurant stands for. Sure makes me think twice about coming here. The prices are the same anywhere, I come here equally because the food kicks ass, but mostly because of the environment and the amazing customer service. Well, this is not what I spent my money on today.",

We really need another airline that flies non-stop to Las Vegas.  We recommend that anyone who has not been there you won't regret it. There staff is also very friendly and always there to help if you have questions.  They are the BEST!!!!  The price that they charge for the AYCE is more than reasonable.

Neither time did the person who took my order (two different people) mention that I needed to provide a credit card number, nor ask me for a credit card, nor tell me payment was needed before the food would be prepared. Only when my husband went to pick up the order, did they start cooking the order. Yes, I realize this makes absolutely no sense. Why would someone call in an order if the restaurant only started cooking the order once you've arrived and paid? Why waste your time even calling ahead?  I left my phone number so they could've called me to ask for a credit card, if one was needed. I would've happily left a credit card number to save the 15-20 minutes waiting there for my order to be prepared, if only they asked for one.

I ordered the mini mochiko chicken bowl, spam musubi and a lychee green tea on my recent trip to Las Vegas. I had heard of Island Sushi a while back but had never been until then. I'm glad I finally went as the food, service and vibe of the place is what I look for when I seek out local food in Vegas. It's a chill place with good food. That's what I seek.  Located along Eastern Ave near the 215 FWY and in the same plaza as Red Rice. Parking lot is shared with the other businesses so just avoid the 30 min only parking spots.  The mochiko chicken was tasty. It had a seasoned batter on it and I really liked that the chicken was still moist on the inside. The only thing I would change is maybe dip the chicken in some katsu or teriyaki sauce next time. Other than that, I really liked it. It came with about 5-6 pieces of chicken, 1 scoop of rice and a side of mac salad. I recommend it for sure. The spam musubi was good and tasty. Cant go wrong with a musubi... The lychee green tea is my favorite of all the Hawaiian Sun drinks. So good. It's like the best flavor, best water ever.   Service is friendly. Food is cooked to order so dont mind the wait, it will be worth it. But definitely prepare to wait a little while especially during the lunch rush. Good food. I will definitely be back.",

    "text": "The first thing about Island Sushi is the vibe. It's a really cool laid back spot with reggae music playing in the background. We were seated quickly to our table. The restaurant had plenty of seating but we came in on a Thursday night. It could be very crowded on a weekend. Our waitress and the staff was very attentive and got our order up and running. They do have an AYCE sushi dinner for $26.95. However, since I was running with my daughter who doesn't eat much I couldn't justify the cost. Anyways, we ordered several rolls. We ordered two California rolls since my daughter is just getting into sushi. I also ordered a Poke roll and the Island roll. All the sushi was delicious. They also have Hawaiian food such as Kalbi ribs, kahlua pig, etc. The next time, I come here (and there will be a next time), I'm definitely going to try their other stuff. The amount of selection for sushi was huge and if you order the AYCE it does come with a dessert.",

I ordered my food for delivery and I'm so stoked to be enjoying this from my house but I cannot wait to dine in!   I ordered the oxtail soup because I saw it being raved about in the comments and trust me, the comments are REAL about this dish!! Even though I had it delivered, when I got it it was still nice and hot. They even wrapped the containers in Saran Wrap to make sure nothing spills!! I opened my container and holy, it smelled delicious. I saw 2-3 big and fatty pieces of oxtail. The cilantro and ginger came separately which I appreciated because I don't eat cilantro aha. It comes with 2 scoops of rice which tastes delicious with the soup.   I also got a side of kalbi. It's around 5 individual bone pieces. A little bit pricey imo but the flavor is really good. I'm addicted to rice so I can eat one piece with one bowl lol.  The malasada w custard is freaking BOMB. I only got one since I've never tried. But the custard is like the ones they put in asian bread and it was soft and chewy and came in it's own box.   Honestly from presentation to taste, everything was perfect! Definitely coming back really soon!",

Knowing the poke had furikake in the mix I again had to ask for it on the rice as well. As for the shoyu, they have never previously asked which shoyu i wanted and was making it difficult when I normally get regular aloha shoyu.

Bringing a large group and trying to finish your meal in the 1/ 1/2 time limit is a little tough. Your trying to enjoy the food and socialize at the same time not just scarf food down fast as I can because of the time restraint. When there are 20 plus in your group the food takes a while to come out also.   My friends who used to love Islands, also have had some bad experiences as the service not being as good as it used to be when they first opened up.    The food is pretty decent but because of the time restraint, it's not a good place for large groups in my opinion since I have tried. I know most Vegas sushi places the have a time limit for all you can eat and Islands is a little more generous with the time but huge groups it doesn't help.  I prefer to go to Sin city sushi across the street, even though Sin city is tiny there is no time limit on the all you can eat and we can relax socialize and enjoy the food without any pressure to hurry.  The food is just as good as Islands or better. The fish being fresher in my opinion.",

Being from San Jose, CA, it's hard to find good poke outside of the islands. Island sushi brought it! Thanks.  I think Monday through Wednesday is happy hour all day which means their sushi rolls are half off. I have become a regular so partner and i tried their all you can eat lunch for 21.95 and tasted (and finished) 6 different rolls and our favorites are: Mauna Kana, Island Special, and the Croc! Unagi on the Croc is crispy... MMMMM!!  Ahi poke bedded on seaweed salad is delicious but at times can be too chewy (possibly not cut correctly?).  Salmon sashimi orgasm is pretty good too. The mussels have too much mayo on it and was too chewy. kinda felt light headed after from that. I honestly have never ate at a sushi testaurant that cut the salmon so lean. Now for the dessert...  Malassadas with vanilla ice cream drizzled with guava sauce and cinnamin crisps was ok but I wouldnt order it again. The ice cream banana tempura smothered in chocolate was better.   If you check in on yelp the Plum bottle of wine was half off. My partner liked it but I personally am not fond of Plum wine.",

The mochiko chicken is crap, the katsu is fatty, the gravy is not good, etc. I mean I guess for up here it's alright but it honestly is not good but is decent. Meh...it's a place to settle for but not have high expectations. Not going lie but if island flavor was here I would hit that place up way more",

We got seated after 5 minutes of standing there, to the right through the shower curtain doors there was a hole in the wall sit down area. The little plates that they put on the table are cute but the little bowl for the soy sauce isn't even big enough to dip a piece of sushi.  Then when you finally figure it out the soy sauce didn't even taste like soy sauce. So I asked for kikkoman soy sauce and three different waitresses passed us by never bringing the kikkoman. We had to ask 3 different waitresses to finally get the soy sauce. So I sat and watched our waitress flirt and laugh with the other table as I was patiently waiting to get some soy sauce to eat my sushi. Wow. To top it off she left a table of 5 people (us) with a tiny dish of ginger and wasabi.... not nearly enough. When we were ready to leave we had to ask for our check and Togo box and wait... All the while another waitress acknowledges us and tells us that if we want to take our 8 pieces of sushi that we had left she was going to charge us full price (we came during happy hour). Wow. Never again, I'll take my business elsewhere, thanks but no thanks.... it didn't even taste all that great. I would rather drive 10 minutes to Samurai sushi, for half price all day long, then ever step foot in that hell hole again.",

The food came out relatively quickly but we had no way of remembering who ordered what (as is common with big sushi orders).  My end of the table continually received tons of sushi to the point where we asked if it was a mistake.  The server kept saying that this was what we ordered even after suggesting several times that perhaps it was for the other end of our large party who hadn't received most of the sushi they had ordered.  Since there is a time limit and a per piece charge for uneaten sushi we cancelled the remaining order for our end of the table.   Meanwhile, the other end of the table had only received one of the rolls out of the 5-6 they had ordered.  When it was brought to the servers attention, she said that it was coming.....but still didn't put it together that our end of the table had gotten way more than we ordered.   So, long story short, the owner came out and pretty much said \"too bad\" and that they could order more since it was all you can eat...  We were already past the 90 minute limit and most of the party was done eating.  Reality is that they were just unaccommodating.  The sushi was fine and the price was right...but I felt bad that some of our party left hungry and they still paid the same amount as the rest of us who were full of sushi.",

Liked it all! They had my favs and usuals, scallop roll, poke, and garlic tuna. Poke was good and they give a nice size amount for one serving, garlic tuna had too much ginger and the scallops were cooked, not what I'm used to but they were all pretty tasty. The dessert was pretty good on the AYCE too. I think it was called the Island Special, basically ice cream and fruit. Simple but refreshing!   The quality of the sushi was good, service was good and the restrooms were clean but c'mon, put some hand soap in the bathroom! They had a sink and paper towels but no soap, what in the heck?! Sorry, had to knock a star off for that, I'm a level 4 germ-a-phobe so it was real bothersome that I had to use my hand sanitizer rather than use what's supposed to be available to you by health department standards.   One other thing that I was pretty disappointed with what that this place is called Island Sushi and a majority of the people that come in to eat here get AYCE sushi but-- they didn't include the malasadas in the AYCE Menu. Not a big deal but I would've rather have had them... Been awhile since I've had them :(  Word to the wise... You have to decide whether or not you want AYCE right away, they're sticklers for it. My sister-in-law ordered edamame and then decided that she wanted AYCE after the order had been put in and and they said that they had to charge her for it because they \"can't\" change it out.",

Especially liked Mickey's rice, a genuine Da Kine comfort food. AYCE prices for dinner are pretty competitive. Will try again. Service could be just a little more responsive. Not really too bad, but the wait staff could be a little more tuned in the customers' needs. Only thing that kept me from grading 4 stars. So 3.5 stars would be a more accurate rating.   There are two parts to Island Sushi. One side of the business is a sit down sushi and grill joint with well spaced tables and a sushi bar. The other side is primarily a take out \"Poke Express\" that serves up different varieties of poke and other goodies, think Island Style small plates. We only tried the lunch time a la carte sushi side. Definitely will try the Island Style take out on a different occasion. If we can find some taro chips to go with the poke, it will be like the Princeville grocery on the north coast of Kauai. Looking forward to checking out Poke Express.   One tip if you plan to go. Parking is not good. Island Sushi is in an Eastern Ave strip mall with inadequate parking. Quite a few of the spaces are marked \"30 mins only\" and \"15 mins only\". We just had to ignore that and parked in a 30 minute spot. Another parking anomaly is that the handicapped parking was at the back of the parking lot. Never saw that before. Regardless, solving the parking dilemma is worth the trip.",

Delicious ahi poke, and a bunch of sides that I wouldn't normally get at sushi places puts this place over the top.  I went with my wife and kids and we just ordered a ton of food.

Portions were good and I would go back to give it a second chance.",

Their eel is always top-notch.  Their ahi poke is good, and it's nice that it comes with AYCE (one dish).  I'm extremely picky with it comes to poke (my Hawaiian pop makes some that is out of this world), but I would recommend it to others.  What gets me right in my sweet spot is their tempura ice cream.  Oh man, is it delicious.  The batter is just the right amount of sweetness, density and melt-in-your-mouth flavor that can make you want to eat 6 bowls of it.  Service can be hit or miss, sometimes slow and sometimes not.  Food is consistently tasty though, so I'll lean towards a 4/5 on this one.",

I was surprised to see how busy it was, being it was a Monday. Then again, they did have Monday night football on.  - Our orders came quickly. First with the appetizers. The sashimi salad is definitely a must try. Lots of flavor and sashimi pieces.  - There are certain items that you can only get once, so we got the soft shell crab. The soft shell crab was actually pretty big compared to other AYCEs around the area. Although, in the Sacramento area, there is no limit to soft shell crab. Nonetheless, it was great!  - The salmon skin roll is always on the top of my list when it comes to getting sushi. More salmon skin than actual pieces of salmon which was good, and not too oily.  - The dynamite wasn't the best I've had. Inaka tasted a bit better.  - The nigiri pieces were solid. Hamachi, salmon, sweet shrimp always rank.  - Out of the special rolls we got, I do regret getting the lava lover roll bc it a too mushy. The salmon lover was a hit. And the surf and turf was alright. Turf tasted like L&L bbq.  - Hamachi kama tasted like others. No bone. good.  - Service was quick and friendly. Bathrooms were clean.  - Best AYCE sushi buffet in the area. The change changer was their desserts! Tempura ice cream FTW. Fried banana! YUM!",

Literally everyone here is friendly, there aren't a bunch of places I can take my grandmother to, due to rude service or patrons, but this is always the go-to spot for us. I'm from hawaii so everything here is up my alley and I've been here so much I've practically had the entire menu, it's a great place to come, it can be busy if you come at lunch or their rush times. The sushi side is great too I've done that a couple times.  I always order Poke here, I've tried it literally anywhere I could in Vegas, this is the only place I recommend to get it. Even though it's frozen, they prepare it in a way that I can't taste that, everywhere else the texture is mush. Here the fish is always firm as if it just came off the boat I really appreciate that as I can't find it anywhere else for a decent price.  Great place to come. Great place for food. Five stars from me, keep up the great work!",

Since we seated at counter, the sushi chefs occasionally asked us if we needed anything which was nice. They recommended me malasadas, so I ordered 3 regular ones and 3 coconut ones.

It's sooooo good, that if you're on the all you can eat menu, you can only order one order per person.  That is definitely saying something.

Service was super crappy & the pregnant girl ( being me ) ordered 4 rolls and never got any of it. One of my cousins paid $27 all you can eat sushi she only received kapa roll seaweed salad and miso soup . Only thing that was good was the mochi ice cream packaged most likely. I will take my ass back to the bay and get some real sushi",

The rice was improperly cooked, lumpy and overcooked. The curry was bland and only onion, undercooked carrots and no potato. Thoughtful in the way they put the Macaroni salad in a seperate container so it won't get hot, BUT stale, probably a few days old MAC salad?! I never throw away macaroni, but this time it was a no go. Good friendly service, poor to go food quality.  Makes me want to go back to Ted's Bakery in Oahu, they are the BEST!  ----------------------------- I was in on Sept 24th around lunchtime, not sure why you ask when I was in there. If you have good cooks and bad cooks, you should know. Maybe the menu has too much variety to keep fresh? Simple items like Macaroni salad should be rotated to keep a fresh product. I've had food through here for years and it used to be much better. No complaints about Poke Express, they are ONO! It's a gamble going to Aloha grill or the sushi place, sometimes good, sometimes bad. How can you go to a place where it goes both ways? I sent you a message on the website.",

There are a lot of mediocre places in the 9th island but the \"broke da mouth\" places, there are only a few. Island Sushi & Grill is one of those places. They cater to the plate lunch seekers, poke enthusiasts and sushi lovers alike. Servings of aloha and food have the same standards - above and beyond. Prices don't make you broke at the end of the meal which makes them a \"winna\". Seriously with places like these in the valley, who really need Zippy's. This establishment brings the taste of the islands to our front door and creates a few more dishes with our islands staples. Weekly specials keep you coming back to see what they are gonna create next.",

I've had the poke from the counter a long time ago, and I used to stop by quite frequently but then the fish started tasting really fishy and I stopped. I decided to come back and give it another go because I love the homage to Hawaii in there and being there transports me back to Hawaii.   However I paid $9 for a half pound of spicy ahi combo poke and it was just super fishy again. Kind of a deal breaker. I'm gonna stick with other poke places for now. Other customers around me were not eating poke and had ordered hot food. I probably should've followed suit?",

My personal favorites were the salmon orgasm & the maguro nigiri that they torch with the sauce.  It's a new addition to the menu & it's phenomenal.    All of the desserts were spot on as well.  I tried the bread pudding, the fried brownie, AND the creme brulee.  You can't go wrong with any one of them.

The front room looks like more of a take out area with some tables and the Hawaiian food take out and the poke counter. Then there is a back room more set up like a restaurant and with a sushi bar included. The food is very good, I wouldn't say the best Hawaiian food in town but very well close too it. It was my first time seeing poke set up like that since out where I live, it's always just poke bowls with either ahi or salmon and then they make it into a bowl for you. Here you could just get the fish by the pound. We got the spicy avocado ahi and it was delicious but wasn't the freshest poke I have ever had and thats a huge factor for me. I got the chicken katsu plate since it had been so long since I have had it. Everything was good, even the potato Mac salad which was different than I was expecting but delicious. My cousin got the loco Moco and it was good but the gravy was way too light. Ohh yeah I almost forgot about the malasadas. They were friggin phenomenal! I really do love this place and if it wasn't for the little thing I would of given 5 stars in a heartbeat!",

I spoke to the restaurant and they confirmed they gave it to the driver- they basically said their liability ended there and I don't blame them for taking that position and I have no reason to not believe them.   My beef is with Yelp and Grubhub  I tried to reach Grubhub multiple times and waited on hold for 35 minutes and they never came to the phone.

    "text": "Island Sushi and Grill is a Hawaiian-Japanese fusion restaurant that also serves breakfast food. It is brightly-lit with lovely wooden seafood decorations (like you are surrounded by swimming fish, octopi, and turtles). At the entrance, there are baked goods like mochi, malassadas (runs out quickly), and various cakes (e.g. guava) displayed that you can order to go or eat for dessert.   The service varied based on who came to my table. The lady who took our orders never checked on us again, and there were different waiters who gave our food/refills/check/to go boxes. If you are Filipino, some of the servers speak Tagalog. I ordered green tea and refused a refill since I still had tea in my cup, but after that first refusal, I was not offered green tea again. My mom and aunt asked for forks because of their arthritis, but didn't get them until asking the 3rd time.  I ordered the Pauhana roll, which is a specialty roll only available during dinner. There is tempura shrimp inside with salmon, tuna, yellowtail, and avocado laid on top and some imitation crab in between. I didn't use ginger, soy sauce, or wasabi since the spicy aioli and ponzu on the roll were already very flavorful. I only felt a small heat on my tongue from random select bites of the roll. Overall, it tasted like a poke bowl presented in sushi form!    My cousin shared her chicken katsu with rice and macaroni salad with me. The breading was really crispy but the chicken meat was a little dry and bland. The dipping katsu sauce was sour and savory, so this made up for the lack of flavor in the entree. You could definitely taste the fried egg that the chicken was coated in. The rice was moist, soft, and sticky, a perfect complement to the chicken. The macaroni salad tasted a lot like mayonnaise and onions.  The other food pictured below are bento boxes type A, with the only difference being teriyaki chicken versus garlic fried chicken. Both boxes had stir-fried soft ramen noodles, teriyaki beef, a thick cut of spam, and white rice with furikake (their version was flavorless seaweed). I wasn't impressed bc the ramen noodles were a bit greasy while the teriyaki and garlic fried chicken sauces were way too sweet- felt like I was eating a dessert.   Onto dessert- I got the Dobash cake. It was a thick slice with moist cake, but the frosting was pasty and sticky.. My cousin let me try her creme brulee, and that is a dessert I recommend. It was really creamy with a crunchy top layer and whipped cream.   Overall, I would come back but not order the Bento boxes or cakes. The service was meh, but I might try the all you can eat sushi menu next time since I was impressed by the Pauhana roll.",

I stopped by after getting my lashes and brows done because personal maintenance makes me hungry apparently. I did not know what to expect when I walked in, maybe some Hawaiian food, sushi, Island food? Trust me, I am not that familiar with Island food although people think I am fully literate on this cuisine because I look Hawaiian or something like that. I do know what I like when it comes to certain Island cuisine and that is when the Island girl makes a guest appearance.  So on my visit, I decided to order the Spam Misubi which I never had until I moved to Vegas. I am not a connoisseur but I have eaten great ones and ones that I felt like saying \"I will never eat this again!\".  The Spam Misubi at Island Sushi was one of the great ones. It was warm and tightly wrapped and so yummy-yummy. I do love spam and rice, I am Fil-Am so I know it is in the DNA.  I also ordered the Specialty fried noodles with Spam and BAM, so spot on!! It tasted like the pansit my mother used to make once or twice a year for special occasions. It truly tasted like something from an Island Mother's kitchen or at least a Fil-Am mother who threw down Grilled Cheese sandwiches in front of me and Fil-food on some annual occasion.   Too bad this place isn't on my side of town as I have been looking for a Hawaiian/ Island like restaurant but that will not stop me from stopping in after getting my lashes glued on.   Mahalo!!",

    "text": "I have heard a lot of good thing about this place but last Friday night was the first time I came here. The restaurant is relatively small with simple decorations, it has a bar area with about 6 chairs. It is a good idea to go to the bar area when you don't have reservation here. We got seated at the bar and of course we got the AYCE ( 26.99 person). It has all kinds of sushi from regular rolls to special rolls and nigiri. I just wish they have more nigiri options but the current selection isn't bad. On top of that, they also have good appetizers and make sure to get their Hamachi Kama which is fried fish with ponzu sauce. Service is also excellent and exceptional. I couldn't ask for a better experience here.",

    "text": "I remember when this place used to be my favorite sushi restaurant in town, Koto. I've given this place a few tries. The food has improved but the service has not. AYCE susi with a taste of Hawaii. Hawaiians are known for being laidback and friendly.   There were plenty of empty tables when we got there yet, we had to wait for a table. Really? We placed out order. Some items took forever but some we never got. I guess our previous server was finishing up his shift but didn't notify us. We tried a few nigiri, rolls, teri beef sliders, garlic edamame, ahi poke, salmon katsu and malassadas. We didn't order that much but we spent 2 hours total here.  Lunch AYCE is from 11:30am-4pm for $21.95 and dinner AYCE is from 4pm-close for $26.95. There are certain items that are only available for dinner, limit 1/person, 2 desserts/person and there's a 90-minute limitfor AYCE. With service slower than molasses, you'll easily go over 90 minutes!   The food was good but the service really turned us off. My boyfriend is very calm and laidback and for him to even say something about the service says a lot. The female server was borderline rude. No smile on her face, no nothing. The servers don't even look up to see if anyone in the restaurant needs something. They walk around with their head down or pretending to be busy. 3 servers and 5 tables, c'mon!",

I usually order from grub hub but this time I had time to actually go a visit the place. Walked in and the guy named Jake was so rude just the way he talks to you. He wasn't only rude to me but waiting for my food after I paid he was rude to an old uncle who just asked for the special and guess what the special wasn't even ready and it was like 11:30am. They like people buy there special but it wasn't ready what is that?!?! Jake also didn't have the best hygiene his breathe was very bad I could smell it from where I was standing when paying. There a business from Hawaii but does not show any Aloha. I use to come see a nice lady named Sessa who was always smiling and nice to everyone where is she?",

Ordered a mini Kalua and Cabbage, spam musubi and some Malasadas for dessert.  I was a bit disappointed with the potato/mac salad, since it was a bit bland.  The kalua and cabbabe was good as was the spam musubi.  Filled the malasadas with custard and chocolate, which are always a great way to cap-off a meal.    Service was friendly and quick.  I'll have to try some other dishes upon my next trip to Vegas.",

They were hot and fluffy.  May not be as original as leonard's but they were very very good!!! Definitely will visit again when in Vegas again!!!!",

They should probably just call it Kalua and leave off \"cabbage\" because every single time they are chintzy with the cabbage.  I ordered it today with extra cabbage which is .75.  I have no problem paying extra but there wasn't any extra.  They did however, throw in the bottom core part of the cabbage . Thanks y'all.  Stinginess with the cabbage aside, this is a decent place to have some teri beef or Katsu.",

Aside from the rolls, the mochiko chicken was my favorite and had a crisp rice flour crust with tender juicy meat inside.    Sushi pieces were fresh but small cuts. No matter, it was all you can eat so that wasn't an issue.   Salmon and hamachi were popular with our table.    Poke was fine and I liked it.  Plan on eating dessert.  I had the 808 special and the malasadas sundae.  The malasadas are made fresh in house.  It was good with vanilla ice cream, fresh cut strawberries, whipped cream and chocolate drizzle.",

Fast forward to a few days later, I decided to give this place another chance for lunch and order to go since we live across the street. I called and the guy who answered the phone said \"please hold\". I was on hold for about 5 mins before I hung up and tried calling again. I received another \"please hold\" and continued to hold for another 5 minutes. At this point I'm just furious. I call back a third time and get the same \"please hold\" I ask the guy on the phone if they are even taking to go orders right now because it seems like they are not wanting any business. He says sorry that he had a big group come in and asked me to \"please hold\" once again. I hung up and will never ever bother trying this place. Don't waste your time. DON'T COME HERE!",

Once we stood up to get seated, the hostess apologized and stated that we had to wait just a bit longer because they accommodated a couple before us who wanted to occupy a 4-seat table so they can sit next to each other rather than face to face.  A total of 45 minutes passes by since we first arrive and I get the attention of a gentleman who seemed to be the manager. I asked how much longer and he states another 10 minutes. After nearly an hour of waiting, we finally get seated. The worst part, my son fell asleep during the wait time and did not get to eat while we were there. To top it off, the manager who was also our server, apparently left for the night but failed to notify another server to take over his duties of serving our table as we were left unattended for nearly 20 minutes. That was the last straw that caused us to ask for the check after only making two rounds of orders of All You Can Eat Sushi.",

    "text": "Today we wanted to take a trek to Henderson area to visit a friend. I've been wanting to try this and it's right by their house (lucky them!).   With so many AYCE places, it's hard to pick and choose. Even having tried many, I couldn't really pick a \"best\", but had more of they're all good, but here's the pros and cons of each particular place kind of answer (IE- some have bomb apps but meh sushi, great nigiri but rolls and apps are boring). I'll go on a limb that this is the best that I've had since it meets a lot of points.   First point- appetizers are interesting, and have a wide variety. Sure, sure. Come for nigiri to get \"moneys worth\" but it gets a bit repetitive that way. I think I get my worth through the variety of foods I get to eat.   Ahi Belly with Pepper Garlic- the sauce was light but not overwhelming that you can't taste the fish melty, fatty yumminess or the nice char. Deep Fried Geso- delicious!! perfectly cooked baby octopus is always a favorite for me. Salmon Lomi- it was just okay. It was more tomatos than anything. Ahi Poke- very nice version. ordered 2! Tako Kimchee- nice thin sliced octopus stirred in with kimchee. Hamachi Kama- I love kama and theirs had such a good char and perfectly crispy skin  Nigiri- the fish was fresh. The plus to me was that they do nigiri smaller than average (dont worry- the rice to fish ratio is very fairly proportional). Now some people might be taken aback since were all used to largesse given in cuts but, the smaller cut is perfectly bite sized and gives the opportunity to sample more variety. Some of these restaurants serve a two bite nigiri and with the BFs braces and jaw he dislikes how he has to bite in half and break it to eat.   Standouts: Escolar/Super White Tuna- pretty good.  Cajun Albacore- very nice seasoning and ponzu sauce Cajun Tuna- this has the seasoning and then has a wasabi aioli which was quite unique and good Yellowtail- this is one of my favorite fish and it was very fresh  All the rest were good too. Only one that was just okay was the mackerel which had a bit of a salty quality to it that isn't the norm.    We also got a special chef creation which was also a highlight of the night- it was a thin slab of rice on nori that was toasted to a crispy cake and topped with spicy chunks of tuna, thin slab of avocado, a dot of siracha, and a sweet sauce- probably eel sauce. It was very nice textures and flavors together.   Rolls- not usually into rolls but only because most places its 90% california roll with different toppings and sauce. Boring. They had some interesting rolls. We tried The Croc which combined a few favorite elements- it has some spice, it has soft shell crab, sweetness from some unagi. Pretty good. I would have gotten more, but between just the two of us, whole rolls is a lot to eat and we wanted variety. Next time when we bring our friends to share with. They don't do half rolls, except on your very last roll you want to order.  I kept getting my favorite handroll though- salmon skin which is lovely here.   Dessert- not just the standard ice cream or mochi, though they do offer that too. They have a malasada sundae, the 808 special and creme brulee. We got the malasada which was yummy and the creme brulee had nice flavors but it wasnt so solid as it should, more runny, but it was still good.   I like that this place can satisfy appetizer people, nigiri people, roll people and even dessert people. It's that reason why I think this is my favorite that we can bring all types of ayce people and their needs can be met. It's $24.95, cheaper by a few bucks than most dinner ayce and I think has better quality than those that hit the $30 mark. They give you 90 minutes which I don't really need, but I just like places where they're not timing you....I think here they realize people like to pace and sometimes, you're just waiting for food since it's all made-to-order stuff.   Did I mention the hospitality? The sushi chef/owner was very attentive, talkative and seems very cool. The staff never even let our ice teas hit halfway and came to check on us a few times to see if we want more appetizers from the kitchen.   Oooh if I lived on this side of town I will come by all the time! Since I don't, we just have to make day trips to Henderson more often!   Onolicious food, Hawaiian hospitality- whats not to love?!    ALOHA!",

We went as a group of 6.... all ordered AYCE.  We had to wait almost 40 minutes between our first order and our second.  That's really unacceptable.  As far as we could see, there were only 2 guys actually making the sushi.  On a Friday night at 6:30?  That's crazy.  And that would probably explain what the hold up was.  Our waitress wouldn't even come near us or make eye contact with us during that 40 minutes, while we were trying to get her attention to find out what was going on.  When we finally flagged down a DIFFERENT server to ask what the problem was, he acted like he couldn't care less.  \"Yeah, we know we're having problems.  You have 90 minutes, don't worry.\"  Lame.  There were still some very yummy rolls, but worth waiting an hour and a half for?  Not at all.    It was very disappointing.",

The sushi was comparable to other AYCE Sushi bars, except their sushi left a slight \"fishy\" taste.  But who am i to complain?.. it's sushi.  What did separate Island from the game was their Sunday Special AYCE \"Pupus\", which I am guessing the Hawaiian version of a tapa.  From French Toast Malasadas to Mahi Mahi Sliders with Wasabi Aioli, the Pupus is what made my 20 bucks worth spending.  If I ever make second rounds, it'll only be for the Mini Peanut Butter Malasadas.  Other than that, I'll probably only come back when I'm in the mood for french toast and raw fish.",

    "text": "Looking at all the good review of this place, I have a high expectation. Unfortunately, It's not as good as I expected.  Price is good, Monday-Tuesday 50 percent off for all the rolls, dine in only. They have breakfast and get 20 percent off from 7 am to 10 am Wednesday night, AYCE pay lunch price and get dinner value.  Quick summary of what I had:  Fried Tako and Octopus - overcook, taste a little bitter, it's been in the deep fryer too long.  Tuna poke - lots of tuna, very simple dish, pretty much tuna sashimi mix with seaweed salad. Nothing special  Kimchee tako, nothing special. Tako mix with kimchee..  Baked mussel. a little citrus flavor mix with spicy mayo baked. Not so special either...  Lomi Salmon, go get a salsa and mix it with salmon and salt. Not my favorite, can't finish it.  Miso soup, not good...  Sushi rolls looks not great, some rolls can't hold the shape, some okay. I will leave that to \"depends on the chef\".  Most rolls is okay, only 1 that I think is good. Island special roll. Other than that, just so so or not good.  Freshness, average 2-3 stars. Uni is the only one I think is okay.  Ama ebi not fresh, color has changed, Deep fried head, not crispy enough, if it's not crispy enough, it's hard to enjoy the head.   Beef teriyaki, better than expected. thin slice beef, tender with a little fat, almost like korean style beef barbeque.  Hamachi Kama, okay. Not too dry, a little crispy outside, pretty good.  Dessert is pretty good, creme brulee, 808 special (fried banana w ice cream), tempura ice cream.   Service is pretty good, considering on how busy it was, they did pretty good job, refilling the drinks. Although, they don't remember which sushi goes to which person, they almost don't care actually. They should care a little bit if they want to have a 5 star service.  If this is a regular sushi restaurant, only deserve 2 stars, but considering how busy they were and an all you can eat restaurant, 3 stars sounds like a better fit.  Will i be back? No... sorry.",

I must say we were thoroughly impressed! I'm not a sushi connoisseur by all means but I have had my share of sushi from all around the world within 39 years of my life and this place generated a big smile on my face when I left. Most AYCE sushi joints around Vegas can't compare to the quality and price of this place. The items you can order with the AYCE deal is extraordinary...especially when you can order kal bi and poke. To top it off, my 11 year old daughter and wife were so happy to be here and loved every bite. And finally, I want to say thank you for supporting the military and offering a military discount to our meal!!! There are few minor flaws about this place. 1. I wish the bathrooms were bigger. 2. I wish you guys would turn up the Hawaiian/Island music more. I couldn't hardly hear what was playing. 3. I wish you guys would open up another restaurant in the Centennial Hills area, or somewhere close to there. Thank you Island Sushi team for the superb experience. We'll be visiting again if we're ever on that side of town.",

This time, my two Hawaiian friends took Eric R. and I and another friend to the Hawaiian brunch! It is all you can eat pupus (appetizers) and desserts for $17.95, add $3 for AYCE sushi! We tried so many things.  We definitely loved the salmon lover roll.  Handrolls were okay (spider roll was overfried and came with krab which it wasn't supposed to but skipped kaiware and gobo which it was supposed to).  Nigiri was tiny but it is probably okay for AYCE since we could try more.  Saba wasn't my fave and that is usually my test of sushi quality. For pupus we had so many things - eggplant \"fries\" with spicy miso, fried tofu, crispy rice cake with spicy tuna and avocado, strawberry salad, cold green tea soba, grilled ahi belly and green onions, ginger chicken lettuce wrap, kimchi fried rice, ahi poke, raw crab poke, Hawaiian sweet roll French toast, and so many other things I can't remember.  Desserts: 808 special (tempura banana, ice cream, strawberries), blueberry tiramisu, warm mango mochi and coconut ice cream....the list goes on. I had iced green tea which was very good.  Service was decent considering the amount of groups and ordering tons of things.  They were hard to find sometimes to refill drinks but otherwise very pleasant.

As we were done with our lunch she came back with our check which was on the same bill, we asked her before we even started if we could have separate checks which she said ok.. we asked her again for separate checks so she went to the back to separate them.. my sister in-law overheared our server and the manager talking in the back about our checks, the manager which then said in a very loud and rude way \"well they should have sat on separate tables if they wanted separate checks\"... With that being said the manager which was a Japanese female came out towards our table and said \"before you start talking let me say what I have to say first\"... really?!! My sister-inlaw told her finally that she just wanted to pay her bill and leave then the manager said all the way across the restaurant \"yes you will pay your bill and never come back\" this was in front on everyone that was in the restaurant!! The bill was separated into 4 checks there was 6 of us, gratuity was places on all checks which was 10.00 so our bad server would have gotten 40.00 from us.. yeah right!! I would suggest to upper management that they train this particular servers and so called manager how to do their job right!! Again I have been going here for years and love the food but this experience has turned me away for a very long time.... gonna try island flavor heared they have better food and great customer service. ....",

The atmosphere is nice and friendly - it has a great casual Hawaiian vibe.  I would say that the bento box prices are slightly higher than other places, but they give you more food than most - so its pretty fair.  We ordered the one of the meals that came with 3 items (we got the fried scallops, the veggie tempura, and beef teriyaki).  The fried scallops were sooo good!  I would come back just for those... they were large and had a great flavor.  The veggie tempura was good (it came with two huge pieces of sweet potato which is my fav kind).  Beef teriyaki was better than most places, but nothing to rave about in my opinion.  We had California rolls and a tuna roll on the side - pretty standard.    For dessert, we got the 808 special.  It's like a banana split, but with fried banana.  LOVED it!  It came with our meal and I was impressed with the size of it considering most of the time meals don't even come with desert!  I would definitely recommend this place if you're looking for a chill place to have sushi.  We'll probably be back.",

I must say the food is definitely awesome and reminds me of home but then of course the owners are from Hawaii!!! Huge fan of the place and the owners are great as well. The food selection is huge and the prices cant be beat especially if you do buffet style for 20 some what dollar's. The service is also on point here and the staff is definitely super friendly and i would totally tell my friends to come here for there sushi cravings!  I do wish this place was closer to me then i would go a little more often haha but no matter, its still worth the drive!!!",

I've been to Island Sushi many times and think that it's the best AYCE sushi spot in vegas but I had never tried the grill side.  Tried it once and will never be back.  I got the bento with garlic ahi and mochiko chicken.  The ahi was over cooked beyond belief...dry as a cardboard and no garlic taste at all.  The mochiko chicken was soggy and tasted old.  The fried noodles that came with the bento was just that...fried noodles.  Not one green onion, onion, kamaboko, char siu...nothing.  The best thing in that bento was the spam.  The wife got the lau lau.  Horrible...dry and no taste at all.  It was like they didnt add any salt and the leaves were not moist at all either.  Came with lomi lomi salmon but no mac salad?! Blasphemy!   I'll be back to the sushi side but never again to the grill side.  Its sad cause I hear so many local peeps raving about this place.  If this is what theyre raving about, I need to open up my own plate lunch / bento spot and show these guys how its done! If this is the best plate lunch / bento place in vegas, thats sad....",

We had the Laihana Roll, Tempura California Roll and Cucumber Salad and Shrimp Tempura  The salad was fresh and enough for two people, mind you it is only cucumbers, sliced thin and a sesame dressing, but very good.  The Laihana Roll was awesome!  A California Roll topped with chicken and mushrooms and a special mayo sauce.    The Tempura California Roll was fantastic as was the Shrimp Tempura.  The tempura batter was not greasy, it was light and crispy!   All ingredients used were fresh, flavorful and abundant.    Price was average and well worth every penny, services was excellent and staff friendly.!",

They have a pretty good variety of poke but I reserve that for weekends since I work on the west side of town and can't get there on weekdays before they sell out!  It's quite a popular place as I see a lot of local people from Hawaii, so  hey, you know it's good.  One of my favorite dishes is just a plain ole bento (the one without the mahi mahi...nooooooo).  Try to make it there as a treat for dinner every pay period.  I'm never a let down.",

Not only do they have super sushi rolls, but the service is exceptional and friendly.  Chuy was our sushi chef and he really made sure to take care of my wife as she is with child and she can't have any fish that is not already cooked.  Chuy made what we call a Chuy Special it had Cream Cheese, Cooked Tempura Shrimp, Sesame, eel sauce and a bunch of other stuff that was so yummy & very tasty!!  Also our sever really went out of her way to hook us up with appetizers and gave us several recommendations of things to try and our water cups were full without asking the whole time.  What an exceptional value and service........next time you go don't forget to ask Chuy for the Chuy Special what a treat you will not be disappointed! Don't forget to pick-up some Hawaiian Custard Doughnuts on the way out...WOW!!",

    "text": "This is probably my favorite place to eat in Vegas. I usually eat on the grill side of the restaurant, and I've only been on the sushi side once, so this review is mostly about the plates they have.  I usually get a 2-item combo which is a dollar more than highest priced item...  Usually it's garlic chicken and and the chicken or pork with eggplant.  The garlic chicken is just perfect.  It's fried, and I want to drink the garlicky soy sauce that it's smothered in.  The eggplant is also really good and they can make it spicy for you.  I'm usually pretty sensitive to spicy food, but the spicyness isn't overwhelming and provides a tiny kick to your muth.  Your plate is really full of the food you order with two scoops of rice and a mac salad.  I've also tried the kalua pig and mochicko chicken.  I'm not from Hawaii, so I don't know how the kalua pig compares, but it's alright...  The mochicko chicken is really similar to the garlic chicken, but it's good in its own way.   There isn't much to say about the service since the grill side is more of a help yourself out, but the guys behind the register are all really cool, and if they were servers, I'm sure they'd be really good.  Also, the malasadas are great especially if they're fresh, and you can get them filled with custard, chocolate, or haupia cream.  They also have a ton of desserts displayed when you first walked in, and somehow I've managed to avoid them (usually because I'm too full to think of dessert when I'm done), but from the way they look, I'm sure they're great.  As for the sushi side, I've only gone once and didn't do the AYCE since back then they had a special for 50% off sushi on Mondays (I'm not sure if it's still there, but I doubt it).   It's been a while, but I think I really enjoyed the Hawaiian roll.  And the food and service on the sushi side is just as good as the grill side...  I can't wait to come back here and am always willing to drive across town to come here.",

Coming from Cali, I always worry about the freshness of fish when I'm less than an hour from the ocean :p So, we stuffed ourselves full. The rolls came out quick and were pretty creative. Best part, my son was 1/2 price because he was under 10 but he ate 20 pieces of salmon sushi :p",

It sucks that although the food was good I still leave a negative review but honestly I will not be back just because if the service me and my party received.  We had a party of 15 and most if us got the all you can eat sushi. We didn't even receive 1/3 of the sushi we ordered because she kept giving our rolls to other people in our party even though me and my wife were on a separate tab. She didn't offer us out desert and just asked us if we wanted the bill at the end- we felt like we were being rushed!   On top of all that she over charged us on our drinks and I when I tried explaining it to her she ignored me and started talking to another person in our party WHILE I WAS STILL TALKING. She rudely said \"fine I'll take it off the bill\". Are you serious!?!? Wth is that?   After she had someone else drop of the revised bill she NEVER came back to pick it up! Our entire party of 15 left because we were waiting so long and me and my wife ended up waiting by our selves until we finally decided to walk up to the cash resister and asked if someone could ring us up. Stephanie should NOT be working in a place where she has to be polite to paying customers or any service oriented job because it is not her cup of tea.. I will not be back here ever again!",

The Ahi poke bowl is just the right mix of spices and shoyu.  They also have a wide variety of flavors line wasabi ahi, furikake ahi poke, spicy avocado poke, salmon poke and even kimchee raw crab!    I also had the salmon skin bowl and that did not disappoint.  The salmon skin was crispy and just the right amount of saltiness.  Most salmon skin I've had were rubbery and hard to chew.    Lastly the malasadas are right on point.  I love haupia and they can fill the malasadas with vanilla chocolate and haupia filling.  Almost as good as Leonard's.    So if you have a craving for island eats, this won't disappoint!",

    "text": "I'm originally from Hawaii and have been here many times. However, the quality of their \"plate lunches\" has drastically dropped. For example, the garlic ahi was one of my favorites but now it's terrible. It's a few thin slices of ahi smothered in an awful, oily, overlooked mixture of shredded cabbage and onions. I scraped it all off and threw it away.   I was also very disappointed in the hamburger steak I ordered previously but I thought it was hard to screw up fried ahi. Boy was I wrong.   Whomever is cooking the dishes must not be tasting their cooking because the quality and flavors aren't close to what you can get at almost any eatery in Hawaii.  Response to owner: I can't remember the day I was there but it was about a week before my posting. To reiterate, fried ahi has enough taste on its own. Best to season it properly and if anything, place it on a thin bed of fresh shredded cabbage.  The ahi I got was smothered in an oily mess of overdone cabbage and onions. There was more cabbage and onions than ahi. Further, the Mac salad needs more flavor. Just mixing it in mayo doesn't cut it. Sorry for the negative rating but I was very disappointed with my meal and I remember it being better in the past. I even mentioned to my wife that you must have new fry cooks.",

Such large portions and great price as well!  The only disappointment was the spam musubi. We ordered the regular and that spam katsu musubi, and felt that there was lacking flavor. It was overpacked with rice, the slice of spam was tiny, and there wasn't any sauce on the inside. We ended up dipping our musubi with our loco moco gravy just to get some more flavor. There was so much rice in one of my musubi's that the seaweed didn't even wrap all the way around :(",

    "text": "I'm not big on giving 5 stars but I think this place deserves it. I have been searching for THE sushi place in Vegas and now I have found it! This is clear across town from where I live, but worth the drive every once in a while. I have been reading the reviews for the place and it had me so excited! Finally, for my bf's birthday, who is a sushi fanatic, we tried Island Sushi.  I like the idea of hawaiian fusion mix. We got here, a small sushi restaurant connected to Poke Express, and sat at the bar. We arrived around 4:15p, so it was still early and there weren't many people here at all. I think our sushi chef, Terrence, seemed like an owner or something. Not sure, but he was awesome! I told him it was our first time there and we had heard about it from Yelp, and he explained everything to us and gave us a special treat in the end.  So first off, we are Uni fans. HAD TO try the uni. It was fresh! Also had the hamachi and salmon. And some other stuff, don't remember. But everything was fresh. They also had a good variety of appetizers to choose from, different types of poke, some traditional sushi apps, and some hawaiian type apps. We ordered... hamachi kama (not a big fan but it wasn't bad), eggplant fries (YUM!!), crab poke (didn't know how to eat it!), little fried octopus (like calamari and it was super yummy! it looked cute too), also.. a couple other things. Can't remember it all, but nothing disappointed me at all. Some went far above expectations.  For the rolls, they had a decent variety and we couldn't decide what to try. They don't really do half orders (only on your last roll you can do a half). So Terrence asked us what we liked and just made some rolls for us. One had hamachi inside and outside and it was great. Also had the Big Island Roll. Did a half order of one the soft shell crab rolls (don't remember the name) and then there was another roll, but don't remember.  And then the desserts! We were limited to one dessert each which was a bummer. Yama Sushi is unlimited but they don't have the variety like Island Sushi! I got the 808 rolls after seeing all the pictures of it. Its deep fried banana with ice cream and whipped cream with fresh strawberries and chocolate syrup. My bf got malasadas (deep fried dough) with ice cream and whipped cream and strawberry sauce. Delicious! Not to mention they gave us mini puffs because we are yelpers! (well at least I am).  Overall, great experience. Their prices are decent. And they gave my bf half off since it was his birthday (we didn't even ask for it). Terrence is great! And the food was fresh and delicious. The servers were nice and the food came out quickly. If only they had a location closer to me, but you can't have everything right? I would go back to this place weekly if I could, but my waistline would not be happy with that. But I definitely recommend this place to everyone.  ALSO!! Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday they have 1/2 off rolls all day. Other days they have half off rolls certain hours for happy hour. Check their website for specials. And they have a full bakery attached to Poke Express (same place). Yum.",

Poke express is inside island sushi and I was strictly coming here for poke but decided to eat at island sushi also. This place is pretty good. Good customer service and good food. The lady that had helped me was nice. She explained all the questions I had and was very nice about it. I liked the Hawaiian food mix that they had going on.   I had the \"grilled\" side of island sushi.  I ordered the loco moco with Portuguese sausage. It was pretty good. I had tried stuff my group had gotten also. No complaints really.  I would recommend coming here just for the poke express but this place is a added bonus. Although it only says ISLAND SUSHI outside and a small poke express on the door when coming in. My food at poke express probably overshadowed how good the food is here so I will probably come back here and give an update if this place is even more awesome or not.",

Pork loco so dry the meat and so little bit, chicken eggplant was all fatty pieces and swimming in oil (this was so junk) and damn we paid $1.25 extra just for brown rice! Most places are free or maybe .50 charge....this seems so excessive! Everything else was ok....we used to rate this place pretty good but just seems with the service and prep that they don't really care anymore. I dunno I don't think we will be back anytime soon.

Favorite rolls off of the all-you-can-eat menu: Big Island  Island Special Black Widow  I wasn't a fan of the Surf and Turf, the roll with beef teriyaki outside/shrimp tempura inside. Just didn't like that mix of flavors but other people in my party did.   Had I done my homework, I would have tried the fried octopus and the spam sushi roll. How could I have Hawaiian food without Spam?   The Ahi belly was tasty. We ordered four of those, one for each of us. Even after 10 rolls, several appetizers, many plates of sushi, I polished off the Marssala dessert without even talking. I totally felt like a pig. I was a pig.  I heard Island Sushi has an awesome brunch. Can't wait to try it. I would rank this place higher than Sushi Mon, for sure.  There was no wait to get in, the service is better, and I think the rolls are more creative. I can't compare it to I Love or Momo (apples and oranges).",

The price is decent and the selection is average. If I want something quick and close by, this is a good bet.   The salmon was fresh and the sashimi salad was really good! Those two things stood out in my mind.   I might be back, however; in Vegas, the competition for SUSHI AYCE CROWN is definitely tough and I feel Island Sushi has some work to do.",

The saimin was normal; I liked that the noodles weren't overcooked. The spicy tuna roll was good, with a good chunk of tuna in each piece and the right amount of spice.  Lastly, we shared butter mochi. Which oddly is like biting into a stick of butter, except it's delicious.  The service was friendly and helpful, gleaming with aloha spirit!

We sat at the counter on a night with not a lot of customers and the food came out promptly.   Now the bad news. The sushi quality was not good... but i guess you can't complain if it's ayce? The cooked food was good but it was very filling so I don't recommend it if you are on the AYCE plan.  Another problem was that they used the \"ajitsuke\" nori (the sweet and spicy flavored nori) for the Uni sushi. I don't know if this is \"hawaiian style\" or they were just plain lazy, but this is the only sushi restaurant that I have been to that uses ajitsuke nori for their \"gunkan\" sushi. And because of the flavor in the nori, it killed the flavor in the uni.   The presentation of the sushi was not like other sushi places too, in a bad way... Even I could probably cut the fish the way the chefs did. It didn't affect the taste, but come on!, they should've taken better sushi-making lessons before they started working behind the counter.  If you want to have AYCE sushi, I would recommend Makino, which is cheaper, or Sushi Mon, which tastes better.",

All-You-Can-Eat Sushi for $24.95 along with $2 Sake Bombs, ALLLLLL DAYYYYY, sounds like a win-win situation in my case!   A few warnings before we get down to the nitty gritty part of my review: -A 90 minute time limit to the AYCE goodness (NOOOOOO!) -A surcharge for wasting food -Only one order of Uni and Sweet Shrimp per person  So, the food:  - The Uni: My first time having it, but I'm sure they did it right because the sweetness of the Sea Urchin and the gooey goodness made me want more than just two rolls. Yummy! - Garlic Chicken: flavor overload in my mouth! Couldn't get enough of this. - Ahi Poki: FRESH FRESH FRESH TUNA! It almost felt as if the fish were swimming in my mouth. - Tempura Philly Roll: Fried. Cream Cheese. Fresh Salmon. I can't ask for a better combination.  All their sushi is extremely fresh and they do sushi right. Make sure you order accordingly because they will charge your ass for leftovers. For dessert, make sure you get the \"808 Special\", tempura-battered bananas and strawberries topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream with a dallop of whipped cream. *drools.   With a party of 14, the service was exceptional. Our waitress kept us happy with our Sake Bombs and kept up with our nonstop demands for food.  They, also, have a pretty decent \"Happy Hour\", which consists of $1.50 Small Beers and $3.00 Big Beers. So, order a Big Beer and a round of Sake and you've got yourself set for about 10 Sake Bombs! Yes!  So, we walked into this place starving and left this place with our bellies full. We didn't even wanna walk the Strip, we just wanted go back to our hotel rooms and pass out. I toast Island Sushi with their $2 Sake Bombs! Yay! Island Sushi, you have got me hooked for life!",

    "text": "Okay kids, I got LOST in Las Vegas (isn't that a movie with that lame-o Nick Cage, I can be wrong, no wait, I was wrong, that's Leaving Las Vegas, and I'm not wrong about him being LAME). With the new car rental terminal thingy being miles away from the airport, I got lost and wound up going the wrong direction in search of the Strip. Don't laugh at me. I'm horrible with my bearings once I get anywhere, but once I get my internal GPS going, I'm good to go.  At any rate, we wound up consulting our Garmin to look for a sushi place and were actually looking for Koto Sushi (never been, but hell it came up on our search so why the hell not), but found that was Island Sushi instead. Scared as hell that sushi can be either BOMB or ASS, we entered in and knew that it wasn't all bad when everyone, well, almost everyone except us, were island folk! No shit! I was thrilled because you want to go to a restaurant that has the people there. Go to a Chinese restaurant that doesn't have chinese people? Are you high? Anyways, real Hawaiians, real ono food, you heard?  Husbandido ordered the chirashi and was NOT disappointed. Was thrilled when he couldn't finish it (take that SF chirashi!) and saw just how much rice there was to offer. I ordered chicken katsu dinner and lo and behold it came with dessert (808 special is a must have, people). So I give them mad props. I frequent SF sushi just as regularly as I frequent my home, and it's nice to find good, solid sushi and grinds as I would at home. I would dare to say not necessarily just good...but maybe better!  I highly recommend this, even if you're not lost. It's worth a drive out, and it's not too far off the freeway to scare the crap out of you.  You will definitely have enough scratch to hit the casinos afterward. Two hungry people fresh from the plane? $34. Baller status.  Oh and the peeps that work there are really COOL! Love 'em. Mahalo!",

    "text": "We have been going here for years, the service has always been okay. Tonight, it was the worst we ever had. We took our 13 year old there with our 18month old for dinner with another couple. We all took the all you can eat deal, except for the toddler of course. Our first two rolls came out about 25 minutes after we ordered them and we were okay with that. We ordered our second set of rolls. During the next 45 minutes, when the waitress checked on us (which was only twice) we let her know we had still not received our rolls. She passed by another 15 minutes later, and we let her know that we still had not received our roll, and asked that she just discount our check and close us out. Rather than doing so, which would be the minimum customer service we should have received, she sends someone from the kitchen to drop off the infamous roll. We said no thank you, we have to leave, just discount the check and we will take care of the bill. He states \" its all you can eat, there's no discount\" to which we reply, \" right, but it took over an hour for a roll to come out, and we cant continue to wait the entire night for every order\" he then stated again, \" so you dont want it? its all you can eat, theres no discount\". We were so frustrated and dealing with a very bored toddler at that point, we just left the money on the table and left. The other couple had paid and left long ago, having to be somewhere, but not before having to ask 3 times for their check. While putting our toddler in his car seat, the man came running out waiving the bill in our face saying \" so youre not going to pay your bill?\" to which we replied \" we left the cash on the table\" he said \" there were two checks\" which we had to explain \" we know, they already paid\" he says \" ok thanks\" and walks away. The complete lack of customer service was incredible. Coming from the service industry, my husband and I were disgusted. All the waitress had to do was offer us a 10% discount.. we are talking 5$ off our bill and an apology. We would have been totally okay with that. We are never going back.",

I hate wasting food so ordered ala carte with the Scotsman. Had miso, Salmon Lomi and garlic ahi tuna to start..the tuna had great flavour and was a fave right away.   For rolls we ordered the Big Island, Mauna Loa and another one with Cali roll topped with baked scallop and mushroom on top, the name escapes me cos I am working on 4 hours sleep while writing this after a night at the BJ tables in The Orleans.   Hats off to the fantastic staff at Island, answered all our questions, and since it was Monday we got 50% off our rolls, Bonus!",

Yes, they have a hawaiian slant to their preparation, and everything tastes okay.  But none of the fish was spectacular, fresh, or well-cut.    Most of the rolls had tons of sauce on top that overpowered the flavor.  The amaebi was not good, and the heads were overfried.    One issue which bugged all of us - the servers kept reminding us that we had to eat everything we ordered...and the sushi came out very slowly.  I wonder if they did that on purpose.    Anyways, right as we were paying the bill the whole restaurant filled with a strong scent of smoke.  We asked the waitress - she laughed and said the chef burnt a bunch of eel in the kitchen.    On the bright side, you don't have to wait an hour for a table like at Sushimon.  But maybe there's a reason for that.  This place would be two stars if it was in California, but being an all you can eat sushi restaurant in a landlocked state, I'll give them three.",

When we walked in, we thought we might be in the wrong place because the front door leads you to the take out counter for Hawaiian food. However, the sushi joint is connected.   During our order, my wife asked if they had any rolls that had sliced strawberries. Unfortunately, they didn't. However, the owner and sushi chef overheard the request and created a roll on the spot that had strawberries. That alone might warrant the 5-star rating, however, the service overall was fantastic as was the AYCE sushi.   The Nigiri sushi is a little smaller than what you normally get at a standard sushi bar, but it doesn't matter when its all you can eat!! The fusion of sushi and Hawaiian cuisine was a little intimidating at first, but after the first bite, it all made sense.  We are tourists and decided to try a local place and we are glad we did.

And considering it was $24.95, you bet I was gonna stuff myself. All you Henderson residents should be aware that its just down the 215, so there's no need to go deep into Vegas itself for places like this.   The place is rather small, and it was actually kinda packed for a Tuesday night. Thus, the people I went with were not allowed to sit at the bar because that section was already full. Service was pretty good though considering it was busy. Our waitress came by often to get us more water or take more orders for the all-you-can-eat dinner. If I remember it right, sake bomb shots were $2. Keep in mind it comes in a glass with the beer already.   Their salmon nigiri is pretty decent, and I'd usually get that with every order I made. I also enjoyed the yellowtail nigiri because the place I normally go to in the Bay Area doesn't have it. Noteworthy rolls include the Mauna Kea, Mt. Charleston, and the spicy Mexican. Had a rainbow roll as well, but yeah it was just like any subpar rainbow roll. Do yourself a favor and get the tempura ice cream for dessert. It's pretty damn awesome, so save room for that. Yeah. I'd go again, but I'd like to try something else too.",

Even though I already went on two other occassions earlier in the week, but it's all good.  For an AYCE, this is one of the better ones I've experienced.  Very extended menu for AYCE.  Included a wide array of appetizers, sushi, rolls, and desserts.  Only thing is that there are a few item which allowed 1 per person.  This was Uni, Amaebi, seared Ahi Toro, Hamachi Kama (large size, not small), Tako kim-chee, couple of rolls, and some other items. This place is where you ordefrfrom a menu , not a buffett line. Food is freshly made upon order.  Over all, it wasn't bad.  The uni was surprisingly fresh.  Amaebi...tolerable.  Other fish items, not bad...not the best quality, but again, this is AYCE.  It also included some dessert, 808 special...good. So was the malsadas and creme brulee.  Best to order one of each to share.  Of the 5 of us who ordered AYCE, we definitely got our moneys worth.  Better than the AYCE places here in LA (Joe's Sushi, todai).  Would I go back here if I return, yes if with a larger group who's not into paying $100 pp for omakase.  This place will do to get your fix for sushi...and then some.",

Not only did she double check, she would warn me each time she place a dish down that had either shrimp or crab. With so many people ordering, that was really going above and beyond. The food quality is very good. I was a little nervous going into an AYCE but it was really fresh. Everyone was happy with the food.There was not a bad dish on the table. I will definitely be back on my next visit to Las Vegas. Thank you Island Sushi and Grill!",

Roxanne came over and asked \"is everything okay\"? My husband and I both said no everything is not okay. She then asked what was wrong and we stated that the fish tasted sour and the rice tasted like it has been sitting out for a couple of days. Instead of being apologetic she said \"well the rice was made this morning, I know I was here and I'm not going to charge you for the extra for the leftovers\" with an attitude I might add. We asked for our bill and I told her we are not coming back and I did not give her a tip. You would think with our complaint they would have given us a discount or something. So I will not be coming back and I don't recommend this place at all.",

We have our \"usual\" & it's consistently good every time!   My boyfriend gets: - Salmon Sashimi w/ Orgasm Sauce - Salmon Lovers Roll - sometimes he'll order something different!   I ALWAYS get the Crunch Roll. I find myself craving it throughout the week. I'm not a sashimi fan, so I do stick with what I'm comfortable with.   As far as service goes, everyone is always friendly & smiling. They make you feel comfortable. Sandy will usually come to our table & say what's up; it's nice when the staff recognizes you!   I love this place. You have to try it! Oh, & the desserts...to die for. 808 Special & the Tempura Fried Ice Cream. Oh myyyy.",

    "text": "So my review is based upon some malasadas that the hubby brought home from  Vegas.  What are Malasadas say you? Malasada is a Portuguese type donut.  Malasadas are made of egg-sized balls of yeast dough that are deep-fried in oil and coated with granulated sugar. They are popular in Hawaii and since Las Vegas is considered the \"9th Island\" you can definitely find them in Vegas...  I was craving the famous Leonard's malasadas found in Oahu, so when my husband visited the in-laws in Vegas, I asked him to find some of these yummy treats and bring some back home to the Bay Area.  My only concern was the fear of being disappointed by what he brings back... boy was I happy!  He came back with some haupia filled Malasadas that felt like it weighed half a pound each.  Haupia is a type of coconut custard, and it was perfect inside these warm slightly crispy Malasadas.  The custard was not too sweet, therefore, i scarfed down like 4 of them... *oops!* **blush**was I supposed to save some for the kids? Overall, they are still not as good as Leonard's but they definitely \"fit the bill\" when it came to cravings..  I cannot wait to try the rest of the food here in person.  BOOKMARK!",

The garlic chicken was very tasty with a nice kick to it so was the garlic ahi. The service wasn't bad. The food came out pretty fast. Cool place overall.",

Had a craving for sushi while out shopping on a Sunday. Island Sushi was nearby so we stopped. SO glad we did. I had never been here for AYCE Sunday brunch and it was to die for. In addition to AYCE sushi covering most of the menu (including apps and cooked food), they also had a huge list of additional offerings including breakfast mains, Hawaiian favorites, special sushi rolls and desserts - all part of the AYCE menu. Banana bread french toast with coconut syrup? Yes, please. Spam omlette? Yes, please. Malasadas with guava syrup? Yes!  I am a very picky sushi eater, but every time I have been to Island Sushi the fish has been very fresh. I also appreciate they dont give you these huge clumps of sushi rice with AYCE in a cheap attempt to fill you up. The staff is always incredibly friendly and helpful and the atmosphere is relaxed. Overall, for the money, quality and service I dont think you can beat Island Sushi for sushi. Make sure you go for Sunday brunch!",

    "text": "A good friend of mine had been raving about this place for a long time, and we finally took a trip down from Salt Lake City in large part to eat here. He swore that he had done his best to oversell the place not just to us, but to many other people, and that nobody had ever been disappointed. Well...he was right. This place is amazing!  Normally, all you can eat sushi is more a matter of finding a place with decent sushi rather than anything great. But Island Sushi is simply fantastic. From the service to the food, I can't believe how good it was!  I'll admit, pulling up to this place, I was somewhat skeptical. It was pretty dark from the outside and didn't even really appear to be open. Even after coming inside, the initial welcome room was dark and pretty void of people. But once we got into the main eating area, it was on!  I knew that we were in for a treat when the sashimi salad and poke bowl came out. I could have eaten nothing but those two and been extremely happy. But my friend was ordering all of his favorites, and we ate all of them happily. The nigiri was perfect--a better ratio of fish to rice than most places. The cooked dishes we had, including soft-shelled crab, tempura shrimp, and beef of a couple of different varieties (one of which was right at the top of the best dishes there) were all perfectly cooked. I probably could have made a meal out of any individual dish I was served, so to have so many different delicious items made for a great experience. Dessert was pretty decent, too. You get your choice of 2 desserts (because you need 2 desserts after all you can eat sushi!), and they're all pretty interesting. There were 2 dishes involving bananas; any place that offers banana desserts gets points in my book.  The service was fantastic. I'm used to waiting long periods of time at any sushi restaurant, much less an all you can eat sushi restaurant, for each round of orders. But Island Sushi was bringing out dishes left and right, as they were prepared. We had a constant stream of food and were never left waiting. Excellent, friendly service!  And price-wise, this place is great. It's only around $25 for all you can eat (although they do limit the quantity of certain dishes that you can order).  Next time I'm in Vegas, I'm definitely coming back to Island Sushi!",

Typically, we would go to Goyemon for the AYCE, but Island Sushi is our next go to place if we don't want to trek to Goyemon.  The fish selection are great here too.  They are fresh and delicious.  What I like to order here are not just the egglants fries, but the crab tako.  I can chow down three order of these because the sauce and the raw crab goes so well together.    For dessert, we only get one order per person, so I typically chose wisely.  I would get the malasada if it was fresh, and not just a lump of stale dough.  If I asked and it has been sitting since earlier that day, I would default to the brownie and scoop of ice cream.  Overall, I am a fan and will return.  They also have a AYCE brunch menu that includes item like King's Hawaiian bread french toast, and other interesting items.  Check it out if you have not done so!",

    "text": "We tried Island Sushi a few times when they first opened and they only had a sit down restaurant. Back then they had so-so food (we had ok sushi) and average service. Unfortunately, we weren't that impressed and wrote them off. Then about a year ago a friend said that IS has opened up a grill section on the opposite side of the sit down restaurant with a very different menu filled with local plate lunch favorites. We heard a lot of good things about their plate lunches, so we had to give them a try.  We walked in during a lunch rush and the first thing I noticed is how empty the sushi and sit down area was and how packed the new grill section was.  I looked over the new menu and was impressed. They had everything...breakfast plates, saimin, burgers, bentos, and many of the plate lunches you would eat in Hawaii.  They also had a dessert case with all kinds of sweets...cakes (chantilly, guava, & haupia), mochi, cocoa puffs (don't do it, they are FAR from Liliha Bakery's gems!), and cookies. And they do make malasada's and they are pretty good. We also had AYCE ($20.99/ person) lunch sushi menu which was very good for the price. They also have a Poke Express in the back of the restaurant.  If you are hosting any party, this is where you should get your poke. They have a wide variety of poke dishes, ahi, tako, shoyu, crab, etc.  Our favorites: Garlic or Mochiko chicken Ahi Belly is ono Hamburger steak Bentos for $8 you can't go wrong.  Tako Poke  Love their breakfast menu- Loco Moco with fried rice  Island Sushi Specials: menu Happy Hour 50% off all sushi rolls + drinks specials Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday     All Day   Drink Specials $3.00 Large Beer $2.25 Hot Sake $4.00 Saketini #1.50 Small Beer $2.00 Sake Bomb   Sushi & Pupu (Appetizer) Brunch AYCE sushi plus Hawaiian pupu menu for $20.95 Sundays                    11:30 AM - 3:00 PM   AYCE Lunch & Dinner Lunch-$20.99 Dinner-$24.95  If you had an ok experience with IS, you should give them another shot. I'm glad we did. They stepped up their game and service.   Shaka brah",

They give you a pencil and paper where you mark down how much sushi rolls or entree's you want. We ordered a lot of food for a party of 18. We were constantly ordering hamachi and sushi rolls. I haven't been this full in forever. Like I couldnt stand up.  The food came in really fast. Coming from Maui on Hawaii, I never get to eat all the hamachi I want and there is not a single AYCE restaurant in Maui. When I come to Vegas, I look forward to AYCE sushi! This is one of my favorite AYCE sushi restaurants and I am coming back!",

I've never had an overall bad experience at a sushi place as there is usually something positive to focus on but this place is a clear exception.  1) Service was horrible from the start. The host was confused with the difference between per piece and all you can eat pricing. Once we were finally seated, it took over 10 mins for someone to come over and when the waitress finally did, just asked what we wanted and walked away. We asked for spicy mayo literally five times and when they finally brought it, only brought two even though we asked for individual ones.  2) I had the baked Tempura Roll and it made me deathly sick. It didn't taste bad but after I finished it, I had to rush to the rest room and still felt sick long after.  3) The place seemed run down and very low end. I like to give places the benefit of the doubt as some great places can be dives but this place takes the cake.  Horrible, horrible experience. Buyer beware!!",

The food is made to order so it takes a while to get your order.   Food: ordered the katsu and their pork loco moco. The food was good. The pork gravy was yummy but it didn't reach its full potential until it was reheated at home. The katsu was OK. It had more breading than chicken. My friends ordered a beef with sauce which they said was very good. I will try that next time. The food overall is just not comparable to some restaurants in Hawaii but it will do!  Staff: these ladies seemed extremely busy and didn't really smile much. I understand that they have things to do but it felt like I was a bother any time I needed something.  They upcharge 89 cents for teriyaki sauce. They only have soy sauce and ketchup on their condiment bar.  Table and chair seating for maybe 6 people per row. They have a bout 4 rows.  Overall, its a nice casual spot to get your Hawaiian fix but it doesn't necessarily trigger nostalgia that will transport you to hawaii --- the POKE side is great though",

The poke bar is all the way at the back and the guy was super nice and friendly. He didn't seem to get impatient as we wanted to sample everything and everything was delicious! He even gave great recommendations and would mix pokes for us.   We also saw that they had sushi so ordered a couple rolls, the sushi is not so great but the poke is to DIE for.

I mean nothing beats some of the joints back at home, but this place is great!  If you are every craving poke or Hawaiian or local food (yes, there is a difference between Hawaiian and local food), then this is a wonderful spot to go to.   I've been to both the plate lunch side and the sushi side and both are great dining options. The sushi side is especially good during happy hour where all of the rolls are 50% off! I believe happy hour is Mon-Wed all day! It's a great deal for delicious sushi. They also have an AYCE option but I've never tried it yet since I usually just go for happy hour!  As for the plate lunch side, I've had the bento boxes (which are really filling) and the spicy tuna bowl which I am a fan of, especially the taro chips inside.  The poke is also not bad. I really enjoyed the spicy tuna avocado one. The fish was good quality and had a nice texture but I wished there were more fish/avocado and less of the spicy mayo.   The parking lot can sometimes get crowded as can the restaurant so try and come early or later in the evening. Also, the sushi side of the restaurant does take reservations so call ahead if you can and know that you have a big party!",

Another trip for the malasadas and coco puffs. Dang this place has the best malasadas in town so far. Perfectly sugared, fried to perfection on the outside with a slight crispyness and then you hit that warm and luscious dough on the inside which gives a light but chewy goodness. Next time I'm ordering a dozen for myself. Coco puffs were quite tasty too. Chocolate pudding was good, the puff was nice and light, and the macadamia nut frosting on top was the closest I've had to Liliha bakery's mac nut butter.",

    "text": "One of the better AYCE sushi places I have tried. I came here for my daughter's 13th birthday because she wanted sushi.  I was thinking feeding a bunch of teenage girls, this could be expensive so I knew I wanted an AYCE option. I also wanted a place that served more than just sushi because let's face it, not everyone can get down on raw fish. I really think I chose the perfect place! Other than the shitty parking lot, and a few service hiccups, I would say we did pretty well.  There ended up being 10 of us. I only made a reservation for 8, and they accommodated us. It was a small squished area, and there was a bigger table they could have put us at, but whatever. It was my fault so I was not going to complain. Three of the girls went with a teriyaki chicken plate that was served with rice and mac salad. It was good. But I was there for the unlimited supply of garlic edamame, gyoza, tempura, tiger rolls, and oh my new favorite, the black widow roll. I did not even realized I like soft shell crab until this roll. They also had great dessert options like brownie sundaes, green tea ice cream, and creme brulee.  There were certain items you could only have one of, but AT LEAST they offer these items unlike other sushi places. (certain sashimis and desserts) And a few certain items that were only available for dinner. Which is a couple bucks more, but still a great price at $27 p/p.  The restaurant is small with a mix of Hawaiian and Japanese decor. The service was not bad. It was not amazing. They forgot a coke, and served us a roll 25 minutes after ordering it. They did not charge us for the 6 uneaten pieces of sushi which I was grateful for. Our total bill including 18% tip came to $300. For sure a decent price for 10 at a sushi spot.  I can't wait to return without the kids, and indulge in their half price happy hour.",

My favorites are the tako (octopus) limu, & the salmon poke (i usually just ask for it with onion, green onion / Hawaiian Style) try Pairing ur poke with the Taro chips they sell too! THEY HAVE THE BEST MALASADAS hands down, even better than the islandS. So, with all that said... aside from the POKE side,I'm posting this review because of the experience i had last night on the other side at ISLAND SUSHI in the actual all you can eat sushi spot. Our server's name was \"MAC\"...I've been in the hospitality industry for years & i must say my bf and i were impressed with his service. He was super cool, and kind, also suggestive & attentive. He was knowledgeable about the menu & i like how he'd suggest items when we didn't know what to order anymore! My family and I made sure we took care of him & tipped him more than appropriately. Everything we ate was so delicious & fresh, & the presentation was better than most AYCE places. This business/restaurant is the closest you'll get to REAL island flavor, I promise you.",

I've eaten here before and the service was excellent then, I don't know what has happened now. I came in and the girl who worked the counter took my order. I stood and waited because everyone else that came in, was dining. Just me and another man were waiting on our order. 20 minutes in neither one of us has gotten our food. I wished that they had a seating area for pickup. But the man got tired of waiting and from what I understand, they messed up and forgot his order, he waited... and he waited too long! So he demanded his money back after he waited an hour! I felt bad for them but understood why he was unhappy. He still had to wait to get his money back, but not in cash! In a gift certificate.. HA! Shows a lot of their character.  Should of been a hint to leave but I still waited and I decided to ask the girl how much longer because people who came in after me got their order and I still had not gotten mines. She responded to me \"what did you order?\" much to my dismay. She sees me standing there and didn't even bother to ask me anything. If in her mind she didn't remember me ordering, shouldn't she have assisted me to see what I needed? So I told her and then she remembers. She ran back to the kitchen and came to me and apologized and said a couple more minutes. I waited about another 15 minutes and my order still didn't come. And the girl just ignored me. I could have thrown a fit like the guy did but I realized how embarrassed they were after he did that. So I stayed patient. The owner comes to me and asks me again what was I waiting on. Are you kidding me? Did they forget my order again? After I tell them for the second time, I see him going back to scoop up my poke, literally 3 minutes later he finally comes with my order.   I will not be coming back. 40 minutes wait and the poke wasn't bad, but definitely not worth the wait. They need to learn how to run a business and be more punctual.",

This time we went for lunch on a Wednesday and it was a little busy. The sushi was great and again the Nigiri was fresh. After enjoying our rolls and Nigiri we had the 808 special. It tasted even better than last time. Island Sushi you lived up to what we had been craving since we visited last year. If you are looking for a good AYCE sushi place this is THE place to go in Las Vegas. We will go back to Island Sushi again next time we visit Las Vegas!",

    "text": "it's been a week since our vegas trip and our friend is still dreaming (literally) about their poke.  found this little unassuming place through yelp and we will definitely be coming back.  the lunch price was 20.95/person and includes hot appetizers, sushi rolls, and nigiri.  i love how this place is all-you-can-ORDER and not all-you-can-pick-through-leftovers-that's-been-sitting-there-for-god-knows-how-long.  the hot appetizer comes out hot because it's made to order.  you have to get the poke.  it was the highlight of my appetizer, entree, and dessert.  they even have a poke bar where you can buy poke by weight and that looked pretty delicious.  the rolls are not very big so you can try a bigger variety w/o being filled up after 1 roll.  i do think they can use a little more filling in the rolls though.  i would review each roll individually but the truth is that we had so many that i don't remember which was what.  the one that stood out to me was the one topped with slices of jalapeno peppers.. that was pretty yummy.  we tried the fried geso (whole octopus - head, tentacles and all) and that was interesting.  it's very chewy, more so than calamari, but it tasted pretty good.  i preferred the chicken with mochiko breading over the garlic chicken.  the mochiko chicken were lightly breaded, more lean, not as fried, flat pieces of chicken.  the garlic chicken looked like popcorn chicken and when i bit into it, all i saw were chunks of fat.  no thank you.  the gyoza was fried all over also, not pan fried.  i prefer the latter.  well actually i prefer the poke, i wish i had filled up the space the gyoza took with poke.  quality of the nigiri was pretty good as well.  the size of the slices of sashimi was decently proportioned to the amount of rice.  it is not top quality but you are also not paying $5-$10 per order of nigiri either.  if you wish you had more fish and less rice, then just order some more poke.  for desser we had the choice of ice cream, tempura ice cream, or the 808 special.  we just got ice cream cuz we were so full by the end of the meal and the 808 special just sounded too crazy: fried tempura banana with ice cream and whip cream etc.  it sounded like a meal in itself.  all in all we were very satisfied with our meal and glad we took the 15-min trip off the strip.  5 stars for getting what we got for the price we paid.  definitely come here with a group so you can try more stuff.  did i mention the poke was the bomb?",

We called asking if their poke station was still open around 7:45pm just to be sure our long drive was worth it. So we decided to order something from their grill section as well and also asked if we could go ahead and place an order for the poke but was told it had to be done in person which is understandable. May I also point out that the lady on the phone did not sound happy at all to talk over the phone. So we arrive there around 8:20 just to have them tell us their poke station is closed because they ran out of fish. Fish! What a horrible excuse. How can they operate their sushi section of the place if there's no fish. Since this is the only poke place that is even remotely close to us we now know better to order poke in the day because obviously they'll \"run out of fish\".",

As far as I know it's the only place in Vegas to get them and they are GOOOOOOD!  Okay, so they're not Leonard's, but they are almost as good.  Just a little more dense.  And they keep well, too.

When one of our friends that lives in Vegas brought us here we were  a bit hesitant about this place.  We walked in and I swear it felt like I just walked into a cafe from Hawaii.  The smell of the malasadas were awesome.  I love how there's a bakery on one side and the restaurant on the other.  So we sat down, a party of 14, and  all ordered AYCE... The faces on the sushi chefs were classic. Hahaha We ordered pretty much every roll they had and every single one was bomb.  I cant remember the names but damn they were good.  The one that got me was the Uni and kimchee fried rice.  Damn that uni was damn good.  I could eat tons of that kimchee fried rice.  So we came to the desert and first thing i see is the malasada ice cream sundae.  WHAT! oh hell yes I will take one pls.  Their malasada was so good we ordered 2 dozen before we left. Hahahaha not as good as Leonards in Hawaii but pretty damn close. The service was the best as close as you can get to the aloha spirit of Hawaii.  Some even still have their pidgin accent. Awesome.   I will definitely be coming here again.. Great place!!!",

YuP, we have a proof of what we ate from the final check. That's right we had 67 plates.   Here are what I thought was a must try:  - Sweet shrimp ( its limited 1 per person)  - Uni * Get it but its not 100% recommended, not as fresh as I wanted it to be *  - Egg plant tempura  - Their Dessert with Fried Banana and Ice Cream ( make sure you get it without the whip cream ) this is to DIE FOR! Definitely try this.   All of the other rolls and appetizers are all pretty decent but as far as what i thought was really good are what I had listed above.

It had a nice thin coating, and the garlic sauce was fucking delicious.  The Island Special roll with spicy soft crab and tuna was tasty as well. Our server, and sushi chef were very attentive even though it was busy. Make sure to go during happy hour (Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday) for %50 percent off all rolls, and drink specials. We ordered a bunch of rolls, and apps, but the bill was still below $50. What a deal!",

The theme of the evening was: small. Maybe Im not used to the AYCE portion sizes but the nigiri sushi and rolls were really small. Even my malasada sundae was small with only a little scoop of ice cream in a little cup.   Island sushi has a strict policy that you must pay for anything you don't finish so not sure why the portions are small. The fish was fresh and the rolls were good, nothing spectacular though. We also ordered the hamachi Kama which was nice to see on the menu (1 per person). You are also able to order many non-sushi items.  The service was very good and I also thought it was a pretty good value for $26.95 pp for dinner so that raised my rating to 3 stars. None of the sushi was outstanding or blew me away though.  I guess AYCE just isn't for me.",

The thing that started to bother me was every time we grab our pick up order, they ALWAYS forget things. Whether it's our somen salad dressing or Mac salad. Or they mess up our order. And we don't notice it til we open everything up when we get home. We usually brush it off and don't mind.  But today when my boyfriend grabbed our food, our combo hamburger meal came with a drink. My boyfriend didn't know. And I told him when he came home that we should've gotten a small drink. And we laughed at the sign that was stuck on the bag. We were like, really? It said they aren't responsible for the orders once the food leaves the restaurant.  Being that we are regulars at this establishment, and that they are ALWAYS FORGETTING things for our order. This was a slap in the face.   Why don't you guys just check the orders better. It's obvious this is a common mistake and that's why they put this note on all the food orders.   Unreal",

    "text": "Sigh. I'd really love to give this place five stars because the food is so bomb and the service on the dine-in side was so fun but I can't because I am 0 for 2 ordering food at the take out side.   First the good: the sushi here is SO GOOD. They have specialty rolls and during happy hour all rolls are half off. I would actually argue that this is as good if not a better deal than their AYCE option. With AYCE you feel obligated to stuff yourself and that hardly ever ends well for anyone. 50% off allows you to try a few things that you'll enjoy and if you stop at a reasonable point, you'll end up spending less than you would for all you can eat.   The service is also good on the restaurant side. Though I had some issues when I was there a couple weeks ago. We had AYCE and the wait staff sometimes took ages to bring out our food and sometimes put the order in twice so two of a given dish would come out (and with all you can eat there's some hazard to double ordering..). Anyway, both of those things happened twice which I didn't care for but the staff were all super sweet so it's hard to get annoyed.   The food is solid though and definitely the #1 reason I keep coming back. This is my favorite place for local food in this area..so give it a try! They also have daily specials on the take out side and some of them look REALLY good. Though if I'm here I like to do sushi. Yum.",

The teriyaki chicken was good and the amount of rice you get with this order was plenty. But the teriyaki beef was just okay. Honestly, we both agreed that we would have been happy ordering Bento C (choice of chicken, $5 prior to tax).   Anyways, the people taking our order were friendly. The wait for our food took a while though since it is cooked to order. There are limited tables in this little place.   Just also wanted to mention that there is a nice sit down restaurant area right next door that you can get their all you can eat special ($21.95 for lunch, $26.95 for dinner... both prices are prior to tax), which we may be interested in trying the next time we find our way here.

It's has a light glaze that is semi sweet with a little punch of garlic. The Mac salad was what you'd expect.  The caterpillar sushi roll was good and met my expectations. The fish was fresh and the sushi rice was as it should be.   Not much to say about my boyfriend being boring and ordering a cheeseburger but he cleaned his plate so that must be a good sign haha.

The cucumber salad was crisp, cold, and refreshing and the taro chips were a great textural variety in the bowl. The poke itself was fresh and perfectly seasoned, not overly salty but just right. The ratio of rice to poke/topping was good, at least that what I judge when I get poke bowls.",

One was Hawaiian food, the other was a Poke place, and the other was Sushi.  Our servers were Johnny and Mac. They are both very nice. Mac is so attentive and great with his customer service.  The food was very good, but I ordered Uni and it did not taste fresh. And for the AYCE, you only get 2 rounds to order food. Am used to having 3 rounds in other places. Some of the items on their menu, you get to only get to order once.",

    "text": "First impression. 3 stars. We entered around 6pm on a Monday. We noticed the Please Wait to be Seated sign with a sign-in log. It was confusing because we stood there...a family of 6 just standing there for a few minutes that felt like 15minutes. We were completely ignored as if the workers were deliberately not looking up just so that they don't have to acknowledge us. After a few minutes of awkward standing...my husband walks up to the guy by the register to ask what the deal is. Then he readily explains to my husband how it works. First off, it would have been nice to have been acknowledged. I understand things get busy but I come from a background of customer service that no matter how busy you are...you should keep a constant habit of looking up at your surroundings. I almost walked out, but hell...we drove from the North side, traffic and all, just to eat dinner there for my son's birthday...I was going to stick it out.  So, apparently the please wait to be seated sign along with the put your name down is for their sushi side. When we wrote our names down it was like magic. Someone came and sat us down. We opted to eat at the sushi side because we were planning on some sushi anyways. I honestly don't know if on the grill side you have to wait to be seated. I'm assuming you'd just order then sit at whatever tables are available.  Once seated, the servers were completely friendly and homely feeling. However, I couldn't shake off this weird vibe I was getting in there. Don't know if it was the aftershock from standing around waiting part, but whatever, and so we ordered.  Kids collectively ordered the classic Loco moco, mini chicken katsu, and side order of fries. I decided for just the spam saimin, while the husband ordered spicy tuna, spicy hamachi, and the spicy salmon roll. M-W is all day happy hour. 50% off their sushi rolls with the exception of their nigiris and hand rolls. That is an awesome deal! Such deal made their sushi taste even better. The husband enjoyed his. Typical.  My saimin was pretty much....saimin. There was nothing extra special or memorable. But, I wasn't expecting anything magical considering it's simply a spam saimin. I did wish my saimin was a little less mushy. It did the job on my saimin crave, though.   I can't tell you what the katsu tasted like but the husband said twas legit. My oldest kanacked off his Loco moco. He opted for all rice and boy was that plate serious. Couldn't tell you what that tasted like, but it looked homely put together.   The fries tasted like the frozen seasoned french fries you can buy yourself. I don't mind that taste so no biggy. It was nice and crispy and that's all the mattered.  Overall, we spent about 34bucks. The server that took care of us was right-on with it. It made up for what had lacked. Once you figure out what happens when you enter...you'll pretty much be taken care of. I did notice it was a man's world that evening. Male chefs, cooks, servers...thought that was kinda cool because that's not something I aways come across. Plus, they all seemed super nice.  I'd return for sure especially for their sushi happy hour if we are in the area or feel like going on a drive. I think it's great that our family has options. The kids can get their 808 fix while the hubs and I can get our sushi on. Overall, I can only give 3 stars because it honestly was just mediocre to me. Maybe in the future I can up a star.  Definitely kid friendly. Highchairs with working buckles, yay! But leave your stroller in the trunk especially if it's busy. For a Monday night...they were poppin'.",

    "text": "Went here last night for the All You Can Eat (AYCE) sushi dinner and I have to say that this was once of the better places I have been to in terms of the quality of sushi. I'd say probably in the top 3. The dinner is almost $30, but you do get a wider selection of choices known as the \"dinner selection items\" which are not available during lunch. Also items marked with a hashtag have a one item per person restriction.   I got about 25 items and I recommend getting the crunch and black widow roll. The eel, ebi, and salmon nigiri was really good too. The hot lava roll was not good at all because it didn't have much taste besides spiciness and the inside of the roll had a red paste texture.   Another highlight was each person gets up to two dessert items which was a first for me at an AYCE sushi. Be sure to try the green tea ice cream (strong green tea taste) and the malasada sundae! Malasada is kinda like a Hawaiian donut that reminds me of a cross between a donut and churro. The tempura ice cream was okay because they only have vanilla ice cream and the fried shell was kinda soggy.  Overall, the experience was very nice and I would go back here again. The only downer about this place is the appearance. When you first walk in it looks like a small bakery place with the main dining area on the right side. It has a hole in the wall sort of feel which is okay, but the other AYCE places I have been to have a more classy atmosphere and they even had lower prices haha. Either way the most important thing is the food right? Definitely give this place a try if you are craving sushi with a good selection of appetizers, side dishes, and desserts.",

We've checked this place out twice and have only been to the poke shack. First time we just got bought some ono poke by the pound to go and the second time we got delicious poke bowls. Both times the fish was great. Did not disappoint.  I see that the grill and the poke shack share space which is no problem at all. We had plenty space to sit while we dined there. We definitely are checking out the brunch special they have in the near future as well as the AYCE sushi. I've heard nothing but great things. Til then I'm a fan of this place and will continue to be a loyal customer.",

When I seen my plate and compared it to the mini garlic chicken, it was the same amount. Also to point out that I had a fried plastic piece with my chicken. My husband told the asian employee, I guess she was the manager or supervisor...she apologize but it wasn't sincere cause she was busy. I'll come back for the malasadas but not sure with the food.

I'm a small girl) Decided to get a REGULAR size garlic chicken this time around because HUNGRY! Literally just looks like a mini but in a bigger box. I'm scared to even order a mini now.  Let's get to the Poke:  First off, why do they have a mute worker at the poke station who didn't even say a SINGLE WORD except for when she was done making it and asked if we wanted anything else. Not even a \"I'll be right with you\" while she was standing there doing something and we're waiting awkwardly. (Also she looks like she absolutely hates her job)   Furikake Ahi is usually my go to. This time they didn't have any already marinated in the fridge so she had to make it. HORRIBLY MADE. Didn't even taste the same not because it wasn't marinated but the sauce literally tasted different. And she forgot the green onions.......... A MUST.  Will not be returning. Sad to say this place used to be one of my favs and now it's at the bottom of my list. Lol it is what it is",

    "text": "Hopefully Terence sees this review and does something about the slowly declining food and customer service.   We have been customers of Island Sushi since we moved here from Hawaii six years ago.  Sorry to say we had our last meal from you folks tonite.  We have seen the food quality and customer service go from stellar to unacceptable.   We ordered from Grubhub tonight and our order was delivered at 5:50 pm.  We had special instructions in our order for no furikake in the bento, which was overlooked.  When I called to let the restaurant know about the mistake, I was made to feel I was taking up their time. The girl I spoke to said I could call Grubhub for a refund. I said that's not the point. The point was that my granddaughter does not like furikake and now has no rice for her bento and there should be some type of quality control implemented every time an order is made.   To make matters worse I ordered the chicken and eggplant which was inedible due to the chicken being raw.  I have been ordering this dish for years and it has steadily become more greasy, mushy, and tonite was the worst with raw pieces of chicken.     This is not the first time our order has been wrong or the food has been unacceptable. We kept trying to give you folks extra chances because we really like your selections, variety and delicious desserts.   But sadly we are moving on.",

Sushi is decent, they also serve Hawaiian barbecue, some good island bakery eats, and also poke. The reason I'm only giving it 4 stars in mainly because of the poke. Don't get me wrong, a lot of my favorite legit poke spots here in Vegas close at 6 and I like that they close much later and still serve poke. They have furikake, shoyu, limu, spicy mayo, Hawaiian style. Now here's where the rating drops for me, the poke is good but they are more expensive. 15.95 opposed to Poke Express or Hawaiian Style and the taste is good but the quality of the ahi is noticeably frozen and does not taste fresh. I get off work at 6pm and I can only see myself coming back here for poke when I'm really craving and it's after 6pm and not my days off. All their other food options is fair game.",

I still can't bring myself to do the all you can eat because I don't eat that much but if you have the appetite I've been told that it's great. This time around we got poke and malasadas. Everyone who ate the poke loves it. Malasadas tastes just like home at Leonard's. Anyone who has eaten there knows what I'm taking about.",

Do away with the note and go through to-go orders with guests like so many other places do.",

I had plans to take my daughter and her friends to another AYCE sushi business but since it was my daughter's 21st b-day the night before, her friends were up, drinking and partying til late, that they woke up pass 1 pm. The original business had already closed for lunch.   I remember Island Sushi & Grill, when a high school classmate posted pictures of the food on social media. From Yelp ratings, reviews and pictures, I had a mother's instinct that my daughter will love Island Sushi & Grill. It was last minute decision and we just walked in with a party of 12. Since my daughter and her friends are locals and living away from the islands for college, I think this restaurant would be so perfect. I actually recommended they do the the AYCE but everyone decided to order off the menu and besides we dined so late for lunch it was actually Happy Hour, so they also ordered sushi off the HH menu.   When we arrived, we waited awhile for a table, I understand, we did walk in with a big party and it was last minute w/out reservations. We got our table and we did received great service. The menu consisted of tons of local foods. Everything sounded so great. I had a hard time deciding on my order. We finally order and WOW, everything looks so good. I looked at everyone's order and I wanted to try it all. I ended up getting the Saimin deluxe , since I was really missing saimin. I needed a saimin fix and this order just did it for me. I loved everything in the saimin and the noodles is like the real kind saimin noodles. While eating, I thought to myself, this saimin actually taste so much better than a popular business back in Hawaii. Everyone enjoyed what they ordered, especially my daughter, main thing, since we are celebrating her special day. My daughter and a few of her friends got the Teishoku set, I know what I will order the next time I visit.   The Teishoku set, no substitutions, includes  4 piece California roll, rice, miso soup, edamame, salad, dessert with your choice of saba, chicken katsu, fried scallops, garlic chicken, mochiko chicken, salmon katsu, mix sashimi, shrimp tempura, teri beef, teri chicken, teri salmon, vegtable tempura, or gyoza. For choice of 1,  11.00, Choice of 2, 14.00 & Choice of 3, 17.00. What a great set!!    All in all, Island Sushi & Grill has such great food. Lots of varieties. This place reminds me of all the local business that is in Hawaii,and all of it combined in to one = Island Sushi & Grill got it all. I will def. be back to try the Teishoku set, besides I paid for loyalty card and I already accumulated lots of points, I want to redeem my rewards. I will be back.",

Came by recently to check it out and recognized the interior, vaguely recalling a previous takeout order. Menu is large, with AYCE and a la carte options that include the usual apps, nigiri, and rolls plus poke and various hawaiian specialties.   Food was fresh across the board- eggplant fries were freshly fried, fish in my rolls was fresh, and everything came out quickly. The rolls themselves, though ordered from the specialty section, were not as impressive as elsewhere (presentation, size) but it was a decent meal. What did impress me was that the service was among the best I've received at an AYCE spot, with nearly every server in the dining room checking on me at least once even though I was sitting at the bar, where I am used to being forgotten elsewhere.",

My sister had a get together on New Year's Eve and ordered a good amount of desserts, including Coco puffs. I'm not a fan of coco puffs but decided to try it since the last time was in Hawaii 6 years ago. I bit into one, and there was a short hair in the chocolate filling, I almost threw up!!! That turned me off even more. I'll probably will never order anything here besides the Poke. I'll stick with other options on Eastern.",

Katsu breading around the spam!), creme puffs, malasadas, and the list goes on and on and on. I moved away from Hawaii 6 years ago so this is a great place to eat in between my trips back home.   I would come here more often if I didn't live on the opposite side of town. :) I normally just order to go but I've been here once for AYCE and that was pretty good. They also added the option to order online too! It's great because you can specify whether or not you want mac salad, all rice, etc. Then you can specify the time you want the pick up and you can also pay online. So easy!  All I have to say now is, get over here and try it. Even if you are not from Hawaii, you will love the food! Don't be afraid to try anything and everything!   Island Sushi - Thank you for always providing great food and excellent customer service!",

    "text": "I hope that anyone that reads my Yelps realizes that I usually review places that have rubbed me the wrong way. (Unless they rub me in a really good way and I've thoroughly enjoyed it.)   First off, this place is the pits. I've been coming here for a while now, and I've experienced quality degrade. The more I come, the less I want to be here. Today is the final nail in the coffin.   What a long wait time to even order food! I was in line for a good 7 minutes before I was given attention to place an order.   Prices are outrageous! For what I got, I would have preferred any other Hawaiian restaurant that's more filling and has better quality.  I got the garlic chicken and chicken katsu combo. My mom got a saimin. So what's easier? Two pieces of different styles of chicken and frying it, or putting noodles, some toppings in a bowl with broth? You tell me...  I got mine in 7 minutes after ordering and was told the saimin will be right out. Great! Then, we waited 7/8 more minutes before requesting a refund. I don't like eating in front of other people, and I don't like waiting so long for something so easy. From the time we ordered to the time I requested a refund... 30 minutes. There was a little wait to ask for a refund.   Maybe I was a little impatient, but don't bring out other people's order when a part of a party has already received their food and the rest haven't. Don't forget to season your customers' food.   We ended up going to Aloha Kitchen on Sunset road and it was only 7 minutes from the time we ordered for it to be bagged ready to go. And they were equally as busy as this failure.  The saving grace which allows for two really generous stars are for their malasadas and their poke. Besides that, you have plenty of Hawaiian favorites to choose from, don't go here if you want to wait and want to eat tasteless food.",

Oh the tempura ice cream is awesome and the island special roll is <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fgreat.my&s=109047f7af0246e7b3b38f47df81e7426b333b75d37dc6b7004597e383b31748\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">great.my</a> wife loves that they have hamachi kama (grilled yellowtail collar) which is bomb too.",

    "text": "Dined here on Friday night 3/2/12.  I was a little skeptical at first being that this place was in a shadier part of downtown Vegas.  My hubby and I had a number of sushi rolls which were all very good and fresh too.    What sticks out in my mind the most about this place however, were not the sushi rolls we ate, but the malasadas we ordered after dinner.  OMFG!  They were soooo insanely delicious!!!  My hubby ordered the plain malasada and I ordered the custard filled malasada.  So freaking good!  It was worth going to a shady area just to eat.  Best foodie find in a while.  They were fresh, soft and warm.  The custard was perfect, not too sweet or overpowering and very creamy.  It was so good, it made it worth while cheating on my diet!  The plain malasada was very tasty too, but the custard filled one was over the top.  A little piece of heaven in your mouth I tell you!  They also have chocolate and haupia filled malasadas too!  I would definitely dine here again as they have a pretty large Hawaiian food menu too.  They have very good prices for breakfast and lunch that I will for sure have to try the next time I am in Vegas.  VERDICT:  GO FOR THE CUSTARD FILLED MALASADAS!  Your taste buds will thank me! :)",

    "text": "\"Whoa, do all the ladies from Hawaii look like this?\" my poker buddy ask while showing me his phone.  \"ummmm....what?\" I say, lost, looking past the beautiful wahine and trying to see the food on the website.  \"Maybe she works there.  If the next flop is red, you're buying lunch\" my bud says excitedly.  \"Book it.\" I say and the rest is history.  It's the usual, great Vegas AYCE place.  Super creative rolls filled with lots of deep fried stuff (soft shell crab, shrimp tempura), stuff mixed with spicy mayo, usually coated with a sweet, teriyaki eel sauce.   Most of the fish taste previously frozen or gassed.  All good though if you skip the nigiri.  What sets this place apart is the local Hawaiian style flavors.  Paniolo roll (teri beef inside, miso sauce, outside) and the poke roll (as its name implies).  Only disappointment, the Maui Wowie. Dang it. (You're a better person if you don't get it.)  Oh yeah, plate lunches are as good as back home.  Local style mochiko chicken, teri beef, mixed plates, and fried noodle combos.    Usual AYCE prices.  Lunch $21, Dinner $25.  All day happy hour with 50% off all rolls (not the AYCE) Mon - Wed. for the lighter eater.  Plate lunches are very reasonable averaging $7.50.  Great place when you're jonesing for a taste of Hawaii.",

    "text": "Disclaimer: I am from Hawaii and love \"local\" (read: non-traditional) sushi!  I have only been in Las Vegas for about three months now, but Island Sushi is my ABSOLUTE FAVORITE restaurant so far!    I always go for dinner and have never waited longer than ten minutes for two people to be seated without reservations!  However, with a bigger group, reservations are recommended.  I always opt for all-you-can-eat sushi, which is $26.95 for dinner.  It's worth it for me because after you eat a couple of rolls, you end up saving money.  However, I know not everyone has my appetite...  What's great about this restaurant is that the sushi is not overloaded with rice, HOWEVER, most orders come with about eight large pieces of sushi.  The value is there because there is a fair amount of filling and toppings, but you may be surprised with the size/amount that comes in one order!  This is the only downside.  I typically order: California Deep Fried Roll, Island Special Roll, Poke Roll, Spam Roll, and the Town & Country Roll.  Yes, all at one time.  Yes, I get my money's worth.  Yes, I gain ten pounds immediately and roll myself home.  All of them are fresh, delicious, and feature a wonderful array of flavors that complement each other perfectly (e.g. sweet, spicy, salty - yum).  Beware that they do charge $2 per piece that you do not finish.  The strategy I found to have worked best is to order everything you think you want to eat at once.  If you wait to think about it, there could be a delay in your order, and once that food begins to settle... defeat is inevitable.  If I order the aforementioned all at once (read: 40 large pieces of sushi), I am able to finish it once I get on a roll (pun intended).  Also, remember to follow-up on your rolls!  Once they didn't bring a roll that I forgot about until the end, and I was so overwhelmed.  As for dessert, I always have the 808 Special!   I just love tempura banana - something I have never had before!  My friend had the tempura ice cream, but we both agreed it wasn't as flavorful.  If you're looking for a Hawaii-feel, the ambiance is great! I believe they play KWXX radio (read: Hawaiian/local music), and everyone is extremely friendly.  I know there's a take-out portion of this restaurant as well with plate lunches, poke bowls, and the like, but I have not tried that yet.  YOU NEED TO GO HERE!",

The fish is all very fresh and delicious.  The best part about the rolls and nigri is that they dont overload the rice and give a good balance of fish and rice, so you aren't getting ripped off.  You also get a variety of appetizers to choose from, and I highly recommend the fried geso (squid/octopus) and the garlic chicken.  Super good!  For dessert, the green tea ice cream or the 808 special are both good and you cannot go wrong with either one.    My friend and I went for lunch and paid 20.95, but after seeing the menu and tallying it up, we easily ate over $200, no lie.  The waitress was shocked on how much we consumed.  haha  On a side note, make sure you save just a tiny bit of space for their bakery next door.  The malasadas are very good.  The plain is the best, but the haupia (coconut) and chocolate filled ones are also very delicious.",

I've been here eight jillion times for AYCE sushi- the service is great, friendly, the sushi chefs are fast, smiling, ready to be of service no matter how busy they are, and I've been there when they've be REALLY busy~!  When you order from the servers the food comes out hot, or cold as the case may be, and quick- never had to remind a server \"we're waiting on,...\" ever.  The AYCE rules are reasonable, and, best of all, never get the feeling they're slowing down because you are doing AYCE -- Rolls are good, a good variety of everything- I developed a shrimp allergy, so even with that, the variety is outstanding, and they will make accommodations.  Not fancy, so don't get your hopes up that you're going to a place that's getting Michelin Stars- if you want a place that you can go, eat good food, relax and have a nice visit with friends and family, there ya go!",

If youre comming here for all you can eat, I dont really recommend here. I was turned off when I found out they give time limits and only cetain sushi for it. So I'd rather go to Sushi Factory on Eastern. DONT GO TO THE ONE ON TROPICANA, its gross there.   Also they have a conjointed hawaiian food place. Awesome malasadas!",

I was a huge fan of SUSHI Mon on Sahara ave earlier.  been there a total of 3 times and on the 3rd time, the sashimi on the rice was thin and lacking.  The food wasnt prepared right... some of the hot items were lukewarm instead.  Nigiri was falling apart so I went to Island Sushi after friend's suggestion.  Been there now the 5th time.  Same thing is happening.  At first, I love this place for its rolls.  It has all sorts of amazing sushi rolls... deep fried sushi with cream cheese, or Las Vegas rolls.  Its sashimi portion was generous while the rice was minimal.  No rice pushing.    The AYCE menu is awesome with many choices... typically the one time order for Uni, Sweet Shrimp and you can always put the sweet shrimp into the soup.  In addition, you can also have the POKE dishes which are awesome, i love the many cool items such as fish head, shrimp tempura.  On this visit, the rice was increasing and sashimi didnt look fresh.  The items came but it wasnt as appetizing as before.  The Unagi was horribly made, it was just a clump of fish and rice and wasnt beautifully presented like before.  Alot of rice in the hand rolls and overall food quality isnt as great.  Im afraid to say, maybe it was an off day, but I did notice an overall decrease in quality.  Its still good, just not as good.  So I will give a 2 star!",

Never ordered ahi poke to go like that.  We ordered a quarter lb of the poke furikake, hawaiian, and the spicy poke. Decent priced.   We also ordered to go... the teriyaki beef with noodle combo & the garlic chicken combo. I kinda felt like i should have asked, \"can i have some beef with my noodles?\" Don't get me wrong, the noodles were good, but I felt like there was just not enough beef.... or chicken.  The staff at the Poke Express area was very very nice. But the rest of the staff behind the grill and register are kinda rude and snoody. And from reading other reviews, it seems like these people have good days and bad days. Word of advice for those moody people.... please leave your bad attitude at home. Its a good thing that the food and the Poke Express person was nice, or i would give this place two stars.",

    "text": "Ok... So let's talk about this place :-)  I live in summerlin and decide to drive all the way out here to check this place out because my friend likes it. I'm always a bit leary because what a friend think's is good quality is completely different then what I think is good.    So... I walk inside and it's divided into 2 types of restaurants in 1 bldg with a wall dividing the two.  Inside the main entrance is the hawaiian side of the dining room with approx 3 tables and a counter area to order from just like aloha kitchen and L&L hawaiian.  On the other side of the wall is the sushi side of the restaurant with several tables and a sushi bar (both halves of this place are VERY small)  So after waiting a few minutes I get a seat at the sushi bar and they have 2 chefs and I think 2 or 3 servers and the place is full.  It is VERY easy to see right away that they are definitely under staffed for the amount of guests they have. After waiting approx 15 min we finally get to place our first order.  The menu looks good and the quality was fine (nothing great but certainly nothing bad at all)  But they were definitely VERY slow both the food and the servers and very cramped inside.  Once thing I will mention is when I ordered the uni (sea urchin) the first piece tasted very funny and odd and I thought ok maybe just maybe it was me.. I tried the 2nd piece and it was very noticeable.    Sorry, This place is definitely not worth going to. There are several places closer to me that I can get avg sushi and better service at.",

The nigiri had a big piece of raw fish over a small little nugget of rice (How sushi SHOULD be!)  Their plate lunches are winnahz too! I've gotten their saba and laulau plate before. They also have these bentos that come with choice of garlic or mochiko chicken and comes with garlic ahi, spam, rice and fried noodles!! All for $8. That beats Zippy's zip & surf pac anyday!! They also have a small bakery that has coco puffs and malasadas.  Definitely one of da best local places to eat in the valley!",

We ordered: Hamachi Kama- generous meaty yummy, Rainbow Roll- lots of fish on top, Mackerel Nigiri. The sushi has no frills. David S said something about the fish being warm. Mine was very room temperature, but nothing happened to me. The atmosphere is casual relative to other places. It's connected to Poke Express. On my way out I got dessert over there.

    "text": "The concept of AYCE Sushi is new to me moving here to Vegas.  At first it sounds too good to be True, followed by a sneaking suspicition of poor quality and limited selection.  Not at Island Sushi! For $20.99 at lunch ($24.95 for dinner), you get a large selection of rolls, nigiri, appetizers, and even desserts.  I mostly avoided the apps (ordered a miso soup and edamame), and stuck with the nigiri.  The fish was fresh and tasty, and the quality was just as good for the most part of some of the fancier sushi joints I have tried around the country.  If you come hungry, you definitely get you money's worth without sacrificing quality.  The atmosphere leaves a bit to be desired, as its in a strip mall and seating area is just cheap tables and chairs.  If you want a fancy dining experience, this is not the place.  I was by myself for lunch and the sushi bar has a small flatscreen TV to watch while I stuffed myself.  They also do quite a few happy hour type specials on rolls and sake bombs throughout the week if you aren't in the AYCE mood.  For your non-raw fish eating friends, the other half of the restrauant has a pretty extensive cooked Hawaiian menu.  However, I don't forsee myself trying that anytime soon.  The sushi deal here is just too good!  Just remember to save some room for that 808 Special dessert!",

If you order a breakfast meal it comes with a side of a delicious sweet bread.    Added bonus is that they make Malasadas daily which is basically a donut coated with sugar.  All my Hawaiian friends says it's the best in town, so i think it's just a \"Island\" thing.  I don't care for them personally, but i bet they're great treats that my Hawaiian friends would appreciate more so.

(i recommend the malasada sundae or the 808 special. both reeeeally good!!!  we went in on superbowl sunday for their AYCE. we caught it just in time for brunch, and their selection was perfect! its different every week, but we were lucky to try their ribs. soooo good!!! i like that they include AYCE desserts too. green tea tiramisu and creme brulee are favorites!!!  island sushi has tons of bakery items, as well as poke express, where they sell many different kinds of poke by weight, and make them to order.  now that im not on that side of town, i crave their food all the time. i try to come back as often as i can though!   i almost forgot - service is great! everyone is very nice and theyre really attentive to their guests, more so on the sushi side. probably best service i've had for AYCE sushi.",

The right side of the restaurant opens at 11:30.  We chose to sit at the sushi counter in front of chef Jason.  He was friendly and quick in preparation.  We had a great lunch thanks to him!   Since they have AYCE, it worked best for us to try several different creations.  Jason suggested the Hamachi which is yellowtail.  In the first bite there was a unique flavor.  We asked him what it was.  They combine orange and lemon into the yellowtail for this distinct flavor.  We immediately loved it.    The 007 was our second choice.  Crab and cucumber topped with shrimp, avocado and eel sauce certainly made this a winner.    The Island Special with soft shell crab topped with spicy tuna, spicy aioli and eel sauce did not disappoint.  Incredible flavors from each roll this far!   The cherry on top was our final order of the Baked Salmon.  This is a California roll topped with cream cheese, salmon and dynamite.  It just melted in your mouth.    I cannot wait to come back and try some of their other choices.  I have a feeling I'm going to enjoy every bite.",

First of all, my kid didn't even touch his Miso soup and had maybe, a couple of spoon fulls of rice (picky eater). And I get a $13 kids dinner charge? I was informed that the owner has updated the \"clause\" in the menu to \"children under 10\" must pay half price for all you can eat...so am I to understand that a 6mo old or a 1yr old - or a 2yr old will be charged $13? The hell is wrong with you? Seriously? I can see how an 8yr old or even a 6yr old could be a threat to your profits, but a 2yr old?  Please reconsider this absurd policy...because it makes you look petty. And your a better place than that. I hope.",

    "text": "The first time I called in to order, the girl working there suggested I try the Katsu Spam Musubi in addition to the regular spam musubi. She said it was really popular...so I did. It was yummy. The spam is fried like chicken katsu before it is rolled in the seaweed. It's more heavy than the regular spam...so I'm going to stick with the basics but I appreciated the suggestion! Prices seem low, which is an added bonus!   The people working here have always been friendly. I also noticed it's busy, so that's a good sign! One night I went in for sushi and there was a 45 minute wait. The sushi side of the restaurant is extremely small and it was packed! The other side of the restaurant (when you first walk in) is for non sushi items and it was busy as well. I think this is always a good sign, especially in this random little strip mall. The sushi was decent, not great. I will stick to the other menu items.  My favorites are the spam musubi, which is usually why I go here! Most times, I place a to go order for just this. I have also tried to kalbi ribs and teriyaki chicken, they are pretty good. I would def recommend calling ahead because even the line to place an order can be kind of ridiculous!",

The all you can eat selection and variety was everything we were looking for. Great customer service and I loved that we did not have to order full rolls, we could get half rolls. This was great as we were able to try more things. The AYCE option is great even for non-sushi lovers as they have great variety of other options. Will definitely come here next time I am in Las Vegas!",

Food: We loved the option to get $26 all you can eat! The sushi is delicious (even cooked options since I'm pregnant) and the portions are small enough that you can try an assortment of different things without completely stuffing yourself! I love the dynamite, kalbi beef, and crunchy shrimp roll.  You can eat plenty of food for the price and their rules (no sharing, no leaving food behind) worked out well.  Service: servers were friendly and helpful  Atmosphere: We liked how there was a takeout/to-go area near the front of the building and then there was also the sit down area. There was plenty of space and room for everyone to be comfortable.  We definitely want to come back and experience more of the all-you-can-eat menu!",

    "text": "My husband and I eat at Island Sushi at least 4 times a month. This time around I walked in at 3:00pm and they would not seat us because they didn't want us to sit on the  tables for \"larger parties\" they could've easily split the table so my friend and I could have lunch. Customer service isn't all that great. They had 16 seats available but could not spare two seats? See pic below..ohh and I asked if he could ask his manager to make an exception and they still said no to us. They simply stated that they needed to leave those table open for larger parties. We walked in 30min later and still no one was seated at those tables. They didn't even have any reservations. Anyways, we ended up eating at Sea Salt Sushi on Bermuda and Serene even better, they have fresh oysters, less busier, the ambiance was relaxing, open space, not as cramped like Island Sushi. Thank you to the hostess and manager who refused to give us an available seat and said the wait would be 30min. We wouldn't of came across a new sushi spot. What upset me even more was that they were laughing at us!",

Which i reply, \"well if i wasn't put on hold for 5 min, i would of been able to tell you before it was made.\" So she puts me on hold again. Now some guy answered and tells me the same thing she did. I said \"well than it's to be remade\". And then he puts me on hold for another FULL 5 mins! Comes back and said \"we were able to add it\".

    "text": "I've had this place bookmarked for a few weeks now and decided to try it yesterday. My friend just got back in town and we wanted to catch up over sushi and sake. I Love Sushi (also on Eastern) is our usual go to but I suggested to be adventurous and try somewhere new!  When you first walk in I believe you're in Poke Express, a separate quick service restaurant inside Island Sushi. There is a place to order to the left and casual seating straight ahead. To the right is an entrance that opens up to Island Sushi which is a pretty small restaurant. We waited to be seated and the host said it would be about 30 min for a table. We decided to get started on sake at the bar and was seated at a table shortly after.   We weren't starving so we ordered a la carte rather than AYCE. I had the spicy garlic edamame, tuna poke, and a spicy tuna hand roll. The tuna wasn't very fresh in either of my tuna entrees. Hand roll was pretty tasteless, so I doused it in soy sauce/wasabi. The tuna poke was highly disappointing!! It wasn't flavorful and the texture of the tuna honestly felt like it sat out for a few hours. Some pieces were dry and chewier than the norm. The tuna was on a bed of seaweed salad, which was also dry. SO dry that when I tried to gather some seaweed salad with my chopsticks, I picked up ALL of the seaweed salad in an large chunk instead.   The spicy garlic edamame wasn't bad, but didn't taste extraordinary enough to make me want to come back to this place...  No complaints with the service, however, the dishes I tried here weren't memorable or enjoyable. Doubtful I'll return.",

The wait was pretty long but they were able to seat us quickly if we sat at the bar. The restaurant is very small and cramped. The seating was especially tight at the bar.   I figured sitting at the bar, service would be better since we had direct access to the sushi chef, but I was wrong. It was hard to get his attention to order anything and there was a number of items we ordered and never received. The service from the kitchen was the same. Slow and on several occasions they brought out what we ordered to another table only to let us know and we were forced to wait a little longer for our items.   The service issues were enough to make me not interested in returning, but the food didn't really do it for me either. No standouts and almost every dish was something I've had better versions of at other sushi restaurants.",

The combination that my niece ordered came out with only half the items, and we seemed to inconvenience our server when we asked for the rest of her items. The first roll that we ordered which is my husband's favorite ended up coming out at the very end of our visit we had to ask twice about it, and when it finally came out it was, burnt, dried out and inedible. Thankfully the busser was good with filling our drinks because ordering was impossible all night. The service has really gone down. They used to be so friendly and fast even when it's busy.",

We chose this place last night for our final family dinner with my son before he leaves for boot camp.   The service has gone way downhill, and the tip that was tacked on to our bill was ridiculous, and not deserved.   There were 4 adults, and 2 small children. While I realize this was technically 6 people, the automatic tip was not warranted in my opinion. Especially since the two small children shared 1 plain noodle plate and drank water. The server didn't even have to help then again for the remainder of the night.   We arrived at 8pm. Got a table about 8:20. Weren't greeted by anyone for at least 10 minutes. Not even for water.   Finally placed our all you can eat order on the little sheet. We ordered a few nigiri, and 6 rolls total. Nigiri came out, and a plate with 3 rolls.   As time went on, we ate everything, but it was getting closer to closing. The server came back and said last call was coming if we wanted to order more. I explained that we were still waiting on 3 rolls. She seemed very confused. Unfortunately one of them was lasagna, which takes a while to make. She apparently never put the order in.  We finally got roll #4 and then the lasagna. She then asked if there was anything else we needed. I again explained that we ordered 6 rolls, and that we now had only gotten 5 of them. She had no idea what I was talking about. I asked if she still had our order sheet, as typically we get those back so we can order more, so I could show her. She didn't know where the sheet was.   FINALLY we got roll #6. It was almost closing time by this point, as we were sitting around forever. Couldn't order any more rolls. We begrudgingly ordered dessert, and then got the bill.   We discovered the automatic tip had been added to the bill. I am guessing due to us being 6 people. Like I explained above though, there were really only 4 adults.   I am writing this because I am pissed. In speaking with a friend of mine, she says the automatic tip can be disputed. With the level of service, I don't feel a $25 tip was warranted. Especially with only 4 adults eating 6 rolls. Ridiculous. That basically puts each roll we ate at $25 each with the $154 we paid.   I am hoping management sees this, and works to train their staff. Our favorite sever wasn't there last night. He always gives excellent service. This was my last dinner as a family with my son, and it was pretty much ruined.",

    "text": "Our favorite place to stop before heading back to Arizona. You can call me \"Fat gurl status\" when I am here because \"Yes, I order everything that I want to eat within the 24-48hrs of all my local kine grinds that I cannot get in Arizona. I mean granted their are a very little handful of places to get my local foods but, this is still my favorite place to stock up before making the road trip back. Some of our favorites are Fried Saimin, variety of our hawpoke - i love their spicy ahi combo and also their Tako wasabi, they also make their homemade Taro chips - sometimes I wish they sold it in bigger bags or zip loc bags but, its soo ono! Their custard pie is also really good and actually better than Zippys and cheaper! Lol - go figure!  I can keep going on and on about this place! Lol - but, you sorta get the picture! One day, Ill have to try their dine in restaurant because it always seem to be really busy and lots of local people/residence of LV either have reservations or are standing in line just to go eat in here!   Update: 8/11/2019  I took up Terrances advice the next time I would be in Vegas to hit up their sunday lunch buffett... Ohh my goodness what a huge feast! After roadtripping from Phoenix for 4 .5 hrs all morning, coming in hungry, and for sure Kanak attack the rest of my afternoon..Lol! Family texting and calling \"where u stay?\" Uuhhh its the saying \"Eh, I meet up with you guys tomorrow!\" I still no can move...Hahaha! What a bomb selection of all you can eat island sushi and local flavored meals, it keeps coming and coming!   Mahalo Bailey for taking great care of us and being on top of your game while running around and taking care of everyone else. Love how all the staff helps each other out... and so nice being surrounded by so many locals! Breathe of fresh air...Hahaha",

I went to pull up the article on my phone to show the cashier if they are still serving it. The cashier, said, NO. She said it was a special, one time only item that they were doing.  At first I was disappointed because the article about the Ube Malasadas was posted yesterday.   Then to my delight, she mentioned that they can make a few for they only have a little Ube cream left. (I just wanted 4 pieces). They made it for us!   I tried it and I give it 3 stars. Why you ask? The Ube cream was delicious, what I expected. It was the Malasada. The malasada tasted as if it was store bought. Didn't have the crispy crust, and the light airiness in the malasada.   I couldn't do 2 stars because the cashier provided excellent service and she did go out if her way to get the product for us.  So 4 stars for service, 2 stars for the malasada.",

    "text": "I've been dining at a Hawaiian spot near my house for a decade now and I'm happy with them but Brah at the gym highly recommended ISG on Eastern. I've been ogling their offerings here on yelp and IG so I decided today was the day for the 13 minute trek to Island Sushi &Grill Henderson.   They have three sections, a sit down section with wait staff, a Poke bar and the main section where you can order in or out with tables for dining or waiting for your order.   I was cheerfully greeted by two very nice young ladies with warm smiles. So not to feel rushed, I took a menu to a table and did my best to limit my order to one entree and those cream filled malasadas pastries.   I'm just gonna jump into the dessert here now. I messed up only getting one. Next time I'm going to get a dozen. May need to head back now before they close at 9pm. It was fresh, fluffy, cream filled gastronomic perfection.   For my entree I selected the garlic chicken with two scoops of steamed white rice and a salad of greens that had a balsamic sesame (???) dressing. Not sure what part of the chicken I was eating but I suspect it was a boneless thigh meat. It was fried with a sweet, tangy sauce with a garlic note. Basically fantastic that paired well with the steam rice. I would order again but there are so many tantalizing options that I want to try on my next 12 visits.   Support you local small businesses.",

One is the regular dining room for sushi, one is for poke only, and then I believe the third one was sort of like an a la cart to go. We dined in the main dining room since we were there to enjoy all you can eat sushi.  We sat at the bar, since there would be a 40 minute wait for a table. The place was pretty busy this particular night.  The sushi chef at the bar was very friendly and speedy. And the most important part was that all of our food had great flavor! The chef really did his thing!  The only opportunity I could mention would be with the servers. They seemed very overwhelmed and inattentive. Likely due to how busy they were.  Overall, it was a great dining experience.",

My favorite sushi roll would be one of the baked rolls, the Lahaina Roll. It consists of the California roll topped with baked chicken & mushrooms. Yes, it's something different but all of the flavors actually mesh together & I always get at least 3 or 4 of these at a time (to myself of course, lol). My husband also enjoys the Lahaina roll.

The food is amazing, the staff is nice, but one thing I would complain about is the wait after ordering (hence why I gave 4 stars). I will say however, the food is worth the wait considering I keep going back.",

    "text": "You bet your bottom dollar that whenever I visit a sushi joint, an All-You-Can-Eat is in order.  Today, we came here for lunch and that's just what I did.  The all you can eat was $21.95.  Here's what I got for lunch:  Chicken Katsu- Very good.  Light and crispy, their katsu sauce was sweet and AH-MAZE-ING!  Hamachi (yellow tail) Nigiri- I know it's fish, however, it tasted a lot more fishier than I'm used to.  This makes me think if it was fresh or not...  Ahi poke- I know there's a poke express right next door.  I don't think this poke was made from them.  I didn't think it was very good.  The Ahi seemed to be a little old.  Geso (fried squid legs with a spicy aioli)- This was GOOOODD!  Whenever I order fried calamari, I always enjoy eating the smaller calamari with legs.  This dish was just legs!  YUM-O.  The menu says spicy aioli but it wasn't spicy at all...BUT DELICIOUS.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!  Garlic Chicken- Sweet teriyaki and garlic sauce all over fried boneless chicken thigh pieces.  Sweet, savory and crispy all at the same time.  ON POINT!  Gyoza- Crispy fried pork pot stickers served with a ponzu (sweet/citrus based soy) sauce.  I love the thin, watery consistency of the ponzu.  Goes well with the crispy gyoza.  Malassada sundae- Definitely a MUST TRY!  First they cut the malassada (fried donuts without the hole and dusted with sugar) in four wedges and fan it out in a bowl.  A scoop of ice cream is placed in the center with a whipped cream topping and the dish is finished with a guava sauce and cut strawberries.  Such an AH-MAZE-ING ending!  I do enjoy the fact that Island sushi is separated into two sections.  One section for just the sushi bar and another section for plate lunch/bento/fast food type service and poke express.  These sections are night and day and appeals to all sorts of diners.  If you are looking for a place that exposes you to Hawaiian-local cuisine, this is definitely the place to go to.",

At $23 per person I expected better quality and bigger pieces of fish. The rolls I tried weren't very tasty either. I was okay with it thinking, I'll get my desserts and couldn't go wrong there right? Wrong again! The butter mochi needed more flavor, coconut milk maybe, the chantilly coco puffs were dry and horrible, tasted like frozen from the box kind, and the chantilly needs more sugar. I also tried the guava cake, again dry and missing the right flavors, my kids wouldn't even eat it! The only thing that was still amazing were their malasadas! Yes, they got that part right! That's unfortunately the only thing I can recommend. I haven't been here in years and it's nowhere near what I remember :(",

They were very understaffed (so, not really the waitstaff's problem) which translated into an annoying ordeal just to get our order taken, water refilled, or our food.  C+  Unfortunately, the food did not make up for the service.  We ordered the salmon sashimi with orgasm sauce ($8).  The salmon was drenched in the mayonnaise-based dressing and, even then, under all that crap, I could tell it wasn't the freshest fish.  Pass.  We also ordered the Joe's Special and Maui Wowie rolls.  I enjoyed the Maui Wowie (shrimp tempura, eel, avocado) but the Joe's Special was pretty underwhelming.  Also, once again, I wasn't impressed with the quality of the fish.  Maybe I was there on a bad day?  The only redeeming quality of our meal was the malasada sundae.  I really enjoyed the fresh malasada (portugese donut), vanilla ice cream, and guava sauce. However, I would not endure another dining experience here just for this dessert.  Which, is a shame, because it's delicious.  Overall: If I ever returned, I'd go to the take-out window and skip the restaurant.",

FOOD:  The quality and freshness of the to-go AHI POKE SALAD was very good, but I prefer poke with no suji or at least less pieces than I got in my serving. There's just something about ruining quality poke with pieces of suji to chew on. It was late so maybe that's all they had left to serve.   The next time I return to Island Sushi I will definitely give the ahi poke another try, definitely do the AYCE option, and order the highly spoken of garlic chicken. I would of never guessed that was a highlighted item there!   A-OK for now but for sure an update to four stars....soon!",

I recommend the ahi poke, joe's special roll and some Teri beef! Make sure not to skip out on dessert. Get the 808 special with tempura bananas! Staff is also amazing.

We had a one year old baby with us who is very picky with food so we had to bring fries with us from a fast food restaurant. The woman who brought us to our table told us that we cannot have outside food inside Island Sushi but I explained to her that it is just food for the baby and to please just let us keep it. She said she would have to ask her manager if that was okay. She spoke to the manager and he came to our table and told her our baby can't keep the food because it is their \"policy\". So for the next hour, our baby just sat there hungry while everyone ate.   So we ordered our food and our first roll got to our table. But none of us can eat because they didn't provide any plates. We sat for a while waiting for someone to come by and nobody came. My sister stood up and went to the front and told them we didn't have plates. They took 5 mins after to finally bring plates. Next, they brought my niece's fish but she couldn't eat it because they didn't bring any forks. We waited again for someone to come by and after 5 minutes, my husband stood up to ask for forks at the front. And it kept getting worse. We ordered rice with the fish but that didn't come until 15 minutes later after the fish. The miso soups didn't come until 20 minutes after we ordered (which if you go to sushi restaurants often, you know that's the first thing they place on your table). They did not give wasabi and ginger until we asked for it (again, sushi restaurants ALWAYS give this automatically) and when they gave us the wasabi, it didn't come with any bowls so my husband had to get up again to the sushi table to ask for one. In total, our family had already gotten up 3 times to ask for stuff. Halfway done through our food, we had to remind them that they still haven't brought 2 rolls that we ordered. Only the manager checked up on us once. Nobody else asked if we needed anything, which is weird considering there were only about 20 people in the restaurant so they weren't that busy for us to be ignored.   Worse yet, the food was horrible. The sushi tastes like the refrigerated ones you can buy at grocery stores. The raw fish were thin and dry. We paid half price for them because of Happy Hour but even so, their sushi is not worth it.   Never coming back to this place again. The only good thing about this place is that the employees were friendly, the manager especially. My guess is that they're just unorganized and forced to follow stupid rules by the owner.",

    "text": "I need to update my review.  Food is still excellent, but having been there 1-2 times per week for the past year, it gets harder more annoying when you realize that certain customers are treated like old friends, and certain customers are treated with complete indifference.  I am fed up with begging for refills, begging for my bill, and being virtually ignored while the manager is chatting up his pals and the wait staff is ignoring me.  If I do ever decide to go back, I will eat at the bar (the ONLY place where you get friendly, fast service), demand my bill immediately and tip the sushi bar workers.  I have always tipped the wait staff over the recommended amount, and still I am treated like a second rate citizen.  It's just not worth it anymore.   Sushi chefs are A+.  The wait staff absolutely ruin this place, and the manager I spoke to does not really seem to care.  Also, having read numerous reviews about the terrible service saddens me that nothing is actually done about it.  Again, I've been going weekly for over a year.  I have never once left thinking \"wow, that was great service.\"  Even when the manager chimes in on Yelp, he offers apology by NOTHING else.    I reiterate:  sit at the sushi bar, immediately ask for your bill, and bring cash so you are not stuck waiting endlessly for the apathetic wait staff.",

It took 10 minutes to order our food and another 15 minutes to get the food. The spicy tuna bowl tasted great, I just wished it looked like a bowl. The food wasn't presentable as I hoped it would be. I also wished they had more help because this place gets packed and it needs more seating arrangements.",

    "text": "After my first visit here, I came 2 more times to come back for more within the same week.  Yes, the stuff I ordered is that good.  Plus, I have an addictive personality.   When you walk in , you have 3 options.    1. Order from their fast food section complete with all your local Hawaiian favorites.  My favorite dish that I have ordered twice from there, is the Garlic Chicken.  If you like crispy fried chicken and garlic, this dish is for you!  It is delicious and will. make you want to come back for more!  The mini size is just the right portion for me.  2. Order from the Poke Express section complete with all your poke needs from Ahi, Salmon, Shrimp, Special combinations, and even cucumber kim chi for your veggie requirements.  My favorites are the Special Combination poke, and the Furikake poke.  The raw fish is fresh, and you can order by the 1/2 pound.  This gets pretty pricey though, and you can get pretty full if you just order a 1/2 pound of poke and maybe a 1/2 pound of cucumber kim chi.  Good for the no carb dieters!  3. Sit down in their sushi restuarant and order sushi.  This I can't comment on because I haven't actually ordered from their menu.     My stars are strictly for option 1 and 2.  If I try option and 3 and love it, I'll add my 5th star.  I'll be back for sure!!!!  Yelp Challenge! Started 8/20/2011 (64/365).",

Although they claim to be combined restaurants you are not allowed to eat in either one unless you're ordering from there.. even if there's no more room. We were already seated with water and they told us to get up and move.. And there was no people on that side. We ended up leaving.  The waiters on the sushi side are not nice at all and can't even accommodate you..  On the Hawaiian food side, I always ordering from a particular Asian girl with tats. She just doesn't make you feel welcome and comfortable and it's just seems like you're a hassle when she's taking your order.  Me and my friends pledged never to go there mainly because of the service",

For awhile, I've been looking for taegu that I used to eat as a kid back in Hawaii & this is the only place where I can find it!  I've been to the sushi side a few times (serves AYCE & more of a sit in restaurant), but I prefer the grill side (sit in & to go available). Bentos are served just like how you would get them in Hawaii & a pretty packed plate for the price. There's always poke bowls on the specials list, but when Poke Express is open that's where I usually order from. Spicy Ahi (tuna with masago & mayo) is the BEST! & if you're into octopus.. Tako with limu is my recommendation!  I probably should've written a review a long time ago, but I guess I was just too busy inhaling all my food. :D",

The fish is fresh and delicious, comparable to sushi I eat when visiting Cali.   Service is always prompt, and the AYCE menu is very comprehensive. I love that appetizers are included. The rolls are creative without being unappetizing, which unfortunately happens at a lot of \"creative\" sushi joints.  I always recommend sitting at the bar, and try to sit in front of Chuy if you can. All the chefs are great, but he is so sociable and nice! I don't think he remembers me from when I used to come here, but he acts like he does. And, that's more than I could ever ask for. Super nice dude.  What makes this place stand out from the rest is that there is a separate side of the restaurant devoted to Hawaiian/Pacific Islander type foods, like butter mochi. You can also buy poke, there!  In short, just go eat there. It's awesome and affordable.",

    "text": "I knew about Island Sushi and Grill because I order from their Poke Express every time I am in Vegas.  In addition to the poke I would order, I would sometimes order from the grill:   - Katsu musubi:  the spam is breaded with the same breading they use for chicken katsu.  Adds a yummy crunch to the block of delicious goodness that is spam, rice and sauce.   -  Goteburg musubi - The portuguese sausage also with rice. Yum! -  Malasadas - like a creme filled donut.    Ive recently also had them cater my sister's bachelorette party which was held at the Vdara.  Their catering menu is available online.  I ordered a small tray (feeds about 10-15 people) each of the:    -  kalbi ($70):  good quality beef perfectly grilled. No sogginess or rubberiness. -  chicken katsu ($36):  Still even crunchy after it was delivered.  -  garlic chicken ($36) :  So simple yet so flavorful -  mac salad ($24) and rice ($17): must haves when ordering Hawaiian food.  I also ordered 6 pounds of the amazing poke.  My order was delivered to the hotel at the time I had requested and without any issues.  I received a call when they were on their way and when the food arrived at the hotel.  The poke was delivered on ice.  Everything was delicious - as expected - and a big hit with the ladies.  I was a bit nervous that it would be too much food for 14 girls, but the small trays turned out to be the perfect amount.  We had enough for dinner, for a late night meal after hitting the club, and even for breakfast!    Needless to say, I highly recommend Island Sushi for a nice meal and/or for catered events.",

The great thing about this place (to me) is that it's away from the LV Strip.  Been there, done that, y'know? Sometimes off the beaten track is best and Island Sushi did not disappoint!  This place is a hole-in-the-wall. No doubt about that.  You want a Zen or tranquil or a sleek sushi house experience, this ain't it.  This is get-down-to-business-eat-your-sushi-or-Hawaiian-favorites kinda joint.   We had a fantastic experience.  The servers were great. Always checking on us, clearing plates, refilling glasses and making sure if we wanted more sushi--and not in a \"hurry up and order\" kind of way, but in a genuine \"would you like more to eat?\" kind of way.    This was my first time doing AYCE sushi (other than Todai which I hated, so I won't count that).  We made sure we understood the rules and then we ordered well.  Very well.  Everything was delicious. Well made and fresh.   We ordered Ahi Poke and Hammachi Kama.  The Ahi Poke was my favorite--the flavors so fresh. I wish I could re-create it at home because I'd eat it at least once a week. The Hammachi was delicious too. It reminded me of the grilled fish my dad serves.  Nigiri: Tuna, Cajun Tuna, Garlic Tuna, Super White Tuna, Albacore, Hammachi, Salmon, Ebi and Unagi.  Some we loved so much we ordered them twice (and 3 times in the case of Garlic Tuna)    Maki: Tiger, Spicy Mexican, Joe's Special.  All so good. If you like Jalapeno and Siracha, the Mexican roll is for you.  For me, it had a nice heat, not too spicy.  The Tiger Roll was my favorite because I love shrimp tempura and spicy tuna--well made and tasty. Joe's Special--I don't know who Joe is, but this is also a fine roll--shrimp tempura, cucumber and ahi.   Save room for dessert.  In fact, if you're full, order dessert anyway.  They're not huge portions but are certainly delicious.  I had the Malassada sundae, made with warm malassada donuts, vanilla ice cream, strawberries and guava sauce drizzle. Every bite was delicious.  I also got to try the warm brownie sundae--also very good. The brownie is dense and rich, almost like a flourless chocolate cake.   The bro is good at math so I had him check our AYCE price versus if we just paid a la carte--the AYCE is definitely a steal.  This is certainly better than any buffet style AYCE sushi because you can order off of 3 different pages of Nigiri and Maki and side dishes and everything is fresh to order.",

    "text": "Why was my visit here so horrible? The first time I came here the food was ehhhh alright, but tonight was just not good. Being from Hawaii you'd expect any place serving Hawaiian food with \"Island\" in it's name to have the flavor & service that reflects Hawaii. My family & I had all you can eat sushi here. Everything was fine until the end... When we're done eating we had some leftovers, we eat all you can eat sushi many times & understand how you may be fined if you leave leftovers. Our main server mentioned that we'd be charged for the leftovers. That was fine. She came back & told us a managers gona have to count each roll leftover. We were fine but getting impatient. Then ANOTHER server came to tell us that we'd be charged for the leftovers...OKAY Then to top it off she says, \"I know you guys are full but can you just eat the rest on that plate & we wont charge you for that one\" SERIOUSLY? Don't tell us what to eat especially if you know that we're full. But it doesn't end here folks. We split the bill in a certain way, the server ends up mixing the cards up & charging the wrong card to the wrong bill. We let her know its wrong. Instead of switching the cards to the correct bill. She halves the entire bill amongst the two cards. NOT how we wanted it in the first place. We were so irritated & frustrated with the service of this place we just left. The food can always be compromised by service but in this case it was both bad.",

    "text": "Big fan but very inconsistent. Sometimes my rice in my nigiri is small, other times it's the biggest ball of rice on this side of the Rockies.  Not in anyway demeaning the quality of fish or sides, but the rice to be honest, not that good. It's almost as if there is something added to the rice that just shouldn't be there. The rice to me, tastes funny, and I never complain because of how polite I am. So I will give them three stars until the quality and consistent size of rice improves.  Terry,  Fish is always great. Love the white tuna, hamachi, and unagi. I try to taste at least one order of each. Rice machines are great. Which is why I have upped my review to four stars.  All this place needs to get to five stars is top notch service. I feel like I come sometimes and the line will be out the door but tables and the bar are open.  Sushi Chefs are top notch and are always great. Some people like going to authentic places where all the chefs are shipped from overseas, but I don't speak Japanese so most conversations are just placing orders.",

Food: I asked them if they served a lot of rice with their nigiri and they told me no and believe me they serve a lot of rice. The sushi flavor is ok. Not the best that I tasted. Presentation: crap! You are serving food. And they are presenting food. It's not just to scarf down. It looked like they just plopped it on the plate. And also for desert they just scooped it in the bowl.

We enjoy this place, but it can at times be quite dirty due to the high volume of customers. It's important to note that you cannot bring discounted rolls home.",

    "text": "Hands down best sushi in town.  Their local Hawaiian food is also amazing.  And don't get me started on desserts.  The butter mochi and chocolate malasadas are to DIE for.    The AYCE sushi is the way that most people go but I never have enough of an appetite so on Mon-Wed I come for the 50% off rolls deal that they offer to locals.  It's a steal and is usually a better deal for someone like me who only gets 2-3 rolls max.  Only beef is that they don't do half rolls, which a lot of AYCE places will do to allow you to try more options.  I highly recommend the kahuku roll (topped with orgasm sauce) and the town and country roll (cali roll with garlic chicken on top).  I also love the lava lover for something spicy.  What I like most is that they don't skimp on fish quality and they don't pile on the rice, even when we do the AYCE.  Plus they have the most extensive AYCE menu out there to include all of their amazing side items--poke, cucumber salad, teri chicken, etc.  If you happen to be in the area on a Sunday and want a great brunch, head to Island Sushi.  They have all you can eat AND all you can drink mimosas.  Just get there early, there's almost always a wait from the time they open until the end of brunch.",

Yet the 2nd visit for lunch took them 1hr and 15 mins to get a 1 plate lunch and 1 mini plate lunch order correct, which they never need get right. In frustration, we just left with what they gave us.   Not worth even 1 star  Update..... 2/01/2016  called in  2 garlic chicken Mini to go, told 10-15mins. Arrived 16mins paid then waited additional 40 mins. Asked for refund, then told the plates where sitting here next to the dount machine for 30 mins. Never did hear from Terrance, yet noticed the abundance of sign which read\" Check your meal before you leave we are not responsible\". Apparently, that's the owners efforts to correct the lack of attention his staff has a handling his customers orders. BTW, It took the manager 22mins to refund my credit card. Of course, they offer the food for free and a box of donuts. I declined since the food sat on the counter forever. I told the cashier and manager, I prefer to pay for my food that way the restaurants stay in business. Several of the patrons waiting for there food nodded in agreement to my conversation with the manager.   I asked to have Terrance the owner call me, which he never did. I can't believe this is not an on going problem with Island Sushi, they wasted another 1hour plus of my day",

Of course we directed our interest to what Yelp had to say.  20.95 for all you can eat sushi PLUS side dishes PLUS Sunday specials!  What a steal!    I was really impressed with the flavors of the sushi and the taste of the food served here.  Of the three other \"all-you-can-eat\" sushi restaurants in Henderson, I have discovered Island Sushi to top it all!  You won't be disappointed!    One thing that I really enjoyed was that they do not flood each roll of sushi with white rice!  You get a significant amount of \"filling\" and \"topping\" on each of the rolls you order!  They aren't being cheap at all!    Also to all those locals from Hawaii out there, they have Poke here!  And it's GOOD!  They also have a extensive plate lunch menu and they serve saimin and bentos!    One suggestion to the fellow yelpers is to come on Sunday!  Those Sunday specials are a steal and are very delicious, particularly the Ahi Belly!    The only downside to this place and for me giving Island Sushi only 4 stars is that you are only limited to one dessert. Cmon!  Dessert is like the best part of a meal!! =P  Hopefully that rule changes!    Even so, I'd definitely be back to try this place!",

Its our 1st time here, and we REALLY don't like going to new sushi places bc we are pretty picky when it comes to sushi, but our usual sushi spot is very pricey and we are on a budget these days :p we ordered 5 rolls btwn the two of us and the sushi came out really fast, and it was very good for the prices! we paid an avg of $7 per roll, they were fresh and presentation was good... A little on the plain side, but we asked for some ponzu, screaming o sauce and siracha sauce and fixed em up a little the way we like them!  What won us over was the friendly and attentive service we got from the servers!! They were great !We will definitely be back!!",

Carbon copy of all the other AYCE sushi places in town for the most part. What this place has that others don't is the aloha spirit. The staff is super friendly and very helpful. Never an empty water cup. When I'm here, I feel like I'm at a friends house. Always feel welcomed.",

Boyfriend & I did AYCE around lunchtime. All the sushi were fresh, huge and delicious! I suggest getting the Chili Garlic Edemame as well! Service was terrific, loved the interior. Just a quaint little place with various Hawaiian decor.  Really appreciated the warm ALOOOOHA spirit, since my boyfriend & I are from Hawaii. Oh, and if you're looking for poke, look no further. Poke Express is next door!  You're welcome. :)",

    "text": "My Island Sushi cherry has officially been popped! My cousins have been telling me to try this place out for months, and finally we all got together to feast!! (I was the only newbie).  WHERE: Located on Eastern & Serene.  WHAT: As a first-timer, I had to do AYCE!! Wouldn't it be a waste if I didn't eat all I could?!! Ok so back to my experience.  I am in love with baked rolls, and the only downside to this place was that AYCE did not have ANY baked rolls whatsoever! I was bummed at first, but when I tried what they did have, my \"bummness level\" decreased.  WHAT I HAD:  The appetizers I had were: ahi poke (I might have to say that this is one of the best I've tasted in town! It was very fresh and tasty), mochiko chicken (ahh, I fell in love after the first bite!), seaweed salad (sweet & delishhhh), and baked mussels (always one of my favorites when on any menu).  Special Sushi rolls I had: -Mt. Charleston roll; Since they didn't have baked rolls, they did have baked scallops on this roll.  I had to take advantage because this was the closest thing to baked that I'd be getting that night. Haha, when I did get my roll, I was very pleased! -Ahi Poke roll; I apparently couldn't get enough of the tuna in my system, I needed more! Kudos to this roll though =). -Island Special roll; this roll was my all time favorite! Everyone must have this! It hit the spot indeed.  *NOTE: if you do decide to do AYCE, you get to choose a free dessert! I always have room for dessert in my tummy =D. There were malasada&icecream, brownie&icecream, just plain icecream, mochi, and I believe there were a couple more.  I settled for my mango mochi of course.  WHY: A lot of people have been comparing Island Sushi to 808 Sushi (because of the whole owner/chef switch, I actually am not so clear of it myself), but I have personally come to conclude that Island Sushi defeats 808 Sushi in my book.",

    "text": "This place is TERRIBLE, don't even waste your time or money here. I called in an order to go yesterday, 5 rolls, seaweed salad, and soup. I pick it up, pay and take it home-- not really trying to open every single box to check and make sure it looks good. My mistake obviously, I get home and open the boxes, and immediately I'm overwhelmed by the smell of fish... okay, I brush it off it IS sushi, I got 3 baked rolls, and 2 special rolls, the Mt Charleston roll was what really got me, I couldn't even eat it. The scallops on top were plain when in the picture it shows sauce, and they were GREY!!!! Scallops are not supposed to be grey. I'm immediately disgusted but brush it off and go to my tempura roll.... it tasted like salt water, which is COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE!! I'm extremely disappointed at this point, I go to eat a baked roll, it tasted like styrofoam. At this point I decided I wanted the $80 (or at least HALF of that) back for my troubles of wasting my time to go pick it up to basically be eating sushi that probably would've given us food poising if we continued to eat it. (Two of the 4 of us did end up getting sick off the 2 or 3 pieces of sushi we ate.)   I called the establishment and asked to speak with a manager, explained why I was disappointed, and she said \"well what would you like me to do?\" I told her I wanted at least half of my money refunded, in which she then told me she was unable to do so until her store manager came in tomorrow (today). I told her to forget it because I work 10-16 hours/day and cannot spend 20 minutes to speak with someone and explain my situation again. Which she then told me she would let her store manager know anyway and he would be giving me a call.   My question is what kind of establishment does not authorize a manager to provide refunds? Where is your customer recovery? I am unhappy and requesting a solution to my problem and your management who is typically responsible for these types of problems cannot even provide me with a solution? This is terrible, terrible food, terrible customer service. I have no IDEA as to how this place has the ratings it does.  It is now 4:45pm on the day that I was supposed to be contacted, and have not heard a single peep out of anyone from this establishment. I am so appalled. Do NOT waste time here.",

    "text": "I met a friend for lunch here yesterday.  We went into the main room with the sushi bar and were seated at a two top table.  Our server, Mariah, was there quickly with menus, took our drink orders, and brought us our iced teas quickly.  She answered the questions we had about items we were considering.  We order two sushi rolls and two side dishes.  The sushi rolls were the standard California roll and a Lava Lover roll which the menu describes as a spicy tuna cucumber roll topped w/ cajun ahi, chili paste & garlic ponzu.  Both rolls were good.  The more interesting of the two was the Lava Lovers roll.  It was not very spicy and carried just a small kick--wasabi being a good addition to the heat for me.  The two sides were mochiko chicken and teriyaki beef.  This was only the second time I had mochiko chicken and I liked it better than the first time I had it elsewhere.  There was not sweet sauce on the chicken.  Rather, it was served plain which was good.  The teriyaki beef was good with a topping of sesame seed for decoration and a small amount of flavor.  We couldn't leave without some dessert.  My friend ordered mango mochi and I got the malassada sundae.  My sundae was very good.  The malassada and the ice cream may have been overkill calorie wise, but ti was very tasty!  I checked out their case and I know where I can buy poke in the future without having to drive to North Las Vegas where I got it once before.   Island is a solid place for sushi and other items from the Pacific.",

It's all just under island sushi & grill.   When you come in, there's a counter for the Hawaiian a la carte food. Up ahead is the poke station. The room to the right is for AYCE sushi. I usually get the poke & it's the best in the valley, in my opinion. I get a fourth or half a pound of the spicy ahi with a side of rice with furikake. Soooo yums!! Their garlic chicken and spicy tuna bowl are fricken good too.   Before my recent visit, I haven't been since like maybe a year? Or 6 months? I'm not really sure. But seems like the people behind the poke station are a bit slower pace. The guy saw me standing there waiting to for someone to take my order but he just kept talking to his coworker... ???

    "text": "Recently I have been an adventurous eater set out to explore the Hawaiian restaurants in the ninth island of Las Vegas. It all started with a few visits to L&L Barbecue that got me hooked on the Hawaiian plate lunch. On a couple of recent weekends, my adventures in dining led me to Island Sushi and Grill.      Island Sushi and Grill is located along the thriving Eastern Avenue Corridor south of Interstate 215 between the signalized Serene and Richmar intersections on the east side. It is in a small shopping center that doesn't draw much attention to the business. The first impression of Island Sushi and Grill from the outside is that it is a fancy sushi restaurant. It is a False impression because inside Island Sushi and Grill is a diverse dining experience.      Island Sushi and Grill is really two different restaurants that are divided into two rooms. The first room when you enter is a Hawaiin restaurant with pastries and take out sushi. There are a few long tables and two counters. The counter close to the door is where you order the Hawaiin food. The counter toward the back by the condiments and beverage machine is the sushi counter. The room to the right is a full service restaurant offering sushi and other entrees. In summary Island Sushi and Grill is a restaurant specializing in two areas of food: sushi and Hawaiin food. Pertaining to my experiences I experienced the plate lunch dinners on my two visits prior to penning this review/reporting of experiences.      On visit number one, I exchanged around $10 for a garlic chicken plate lunch with fountain beverage then a week later on visit number two, I exchanged around $10 on a chicken with eggplant plate lunch with fountain beverage. Being that they are plate lunches they included white rice and macaroni salad. The food was served in a styrofoam box that I brought to the table after they called my order. On both visits the chicken met my expectations. For safe measure, I added schirachi sauce to it just as I added soy sauce to the rice. L&L has far better macaroni salad and Ross J's  Aloha Hawaiian Barbecue serves far larger portions. This is the first restaurant that my food adventures led me that offered chicken with eggplant. It seemed to be chicken over eggplant with a lot of white rice around it and a little cup of macaroni salad nearby.      Being an adventurous eater, I foresee many more restaurants to explore. Before I set sail for further dining adventures, my report on dining two times in Island Sushi and Grill is that it is a three star  experience.",

Then you look to the right and there's a curtain leading into the Sushi side of the restaurant, where you need to sign your name and wait for a greeter to come out.  We have yet to try the sushi, so I can't comment.   Back to the Grill.  You can always mix the plates for two meats, add brown rice for a fee.  Chicken katsu curry- breaded with panko, fried to a beautiful brown, then a scoopful of curry spread over the chicken.  The chicken evenly sliced and you could see a good cut of meat with just enough panko crust for a good crisp texture.   Lau Lau- Last I heard, they do fly it in from Hawaii, so you can't mess this one up since it's from a trusted brand.  Good chunk of meat, good small bit of butterfish and love the taro leaves.  Kalua Pork- This is one of my favorite.  It has a nice smokey flavor, good shredded pork and a small amount of cabbage (some times more cabbage, which I like).  A simple, yet flavorful and satisfying dish.  Come for saimin, oxtail soup, local moco, musubi or Korean bbq.  So far, this is my favorite place for authentic Hawaiian flavors.    They have malasadas (not a fan), haupia desserts, chocolate this, banana that, a whole display case that can be quite luring.    Pay $2 for the frequent customer loyalty card.  After you spend $250, they credit $25 for food here. (This card is not good for the poke counter, just for the kitchen food and sushi from the restaurant).",

    "text": "Favorite sushi place here in Las Gaygas! Hubby and I always come for AYCE. Our favorite rolls are the Kahuku, Mapuana, Dragon, 007 and lasagna. They also have a great selection of appetizers including shrimp tempura, kalbi ribs, seaweed salad, cucumber salad, and others. My favorite is the seafood dynamite. It's clams, scallops, and shrimp covered with spicy mayonnaise and onions and baked. Their desserts are also quite tasty. I always order the 808 special. It's a combination of strawberries and bananas fried in tempura batter with vanilla ice cream and whipped cream. My hubby ordered the creme brulee once and it was laughably small, slightly larger than a half dollar coin! Mocha ice cream is also very good.   The only reason I knocked off a star is because of the service. They always take forever to refill drinks and the waitress there is often rude. I understand that it's always busy but crack a smile once in awhile and don't be so short with the customers.",

Dessert case includes an amazing selection as well.   Came back the next day for lunch on the grill side. Ox tail is authentic, not fatty, and super delicious. My sisters ordered the garlic chicken bento box and teriyaki beef box. Teriyaki beef was not the usual flavor you would expect, but had a nice Hawaiian twist.   The poke bar at the back of the grill area had the best poke I've ever eaten. I got the shoyu ahi poke bowl with brown rice and it was THE BESTTTTTT THING THEY HAVE. I get poke wherever I go and this beats everything. The fish was fresh and flavorful. Portions were superb. The regular bowl was about $10 and filled me up.   Highly recommend this place if you're in the Vegas area. Service is great, bathrooms are clean, food is made fresh and sushi is amazing as well.",

I'm a sucker for sushi, and the fact that this place has an all-you-can-eat choice makes it more awesome. One of my favorite things to get, surprisingly, is the California roll. I don't know why. I just really like the way they make it. My other favorite thing to order is the salmon skin roll. Nice and crispy salmon skin with veggies in a sushi roll. Of course if you would rather order sushi without stuffing yourself with the sushi rolls, you can order things like ikura, scallop mayo, ika, unagi, and ahi. Service hasn't always been the best, but the servers are super busy, so you just need to be patient. This place definitely has the Hawaiian feels, so that's another reason I like coming here. I really wish Island Sushi was on Oahu.",

Also, sashimi salad and crab salad only available for the dinner price. The other sushi joints near the strip charges the lunch price and provides all of those.   Ordered a bunch of sushi: albacore, tuna, white tuna etc. The fish was a teeny tiny very thin slice of fish on a very large piece of cold, hard rice. I had trouble swallowing the sushi. The quality of fish was ok. I got the dinner price and ordered the crab salad and the sashimi salad, compared to some of the other AYCE sushi joints, the sashimi salad is tiny, and only had very few pieces of fish. Really disappointing quality compared to the other places. Also, I ordered the sweet shrimp which only came with 1 piece, other sushi places gives 2 pieces and charges less.   The service was good, sushi chef was nice, BUT I was charged extra for hot tea! Many sushi joints gives complimentary hot tea. Really disappointing and will not come back anymore.",

Try there special sushi like Candy Cane, Mauna Loa, Surf and Turf etc. Food is comes pretty quick and servers are pretty cool.",

It would just require reheating the grills and if we wouldn't mind the wait.

The place was not packed but they had a a good amount of people. However, the orders came out slow. One person received their food and 10 minutes later another person received theirs.   Does the staff not know that we need small dishes for soy sauce? Do they need to be asked to bring some ginger and wasabi? Hello, it is a sushi place and we are all ordering sushi.  So, the sushi was ok. Its not great and not bad.  Because we had a large group, we were charged 18% gratuity. The charge was on the pre-discounted amount plus tax. So, we really paid 29%. This might be the new norm but I think it is wrong.  The service was sub-par at best. It was hard to get the wait persons attention. I know they have a hard job and I am sure they are nice people.",

I fell in love at first site :) It was delicious (for you kimchee lovers). It separates into the Island Sushi room. A nice sit down, let's drink a glass of wine or a bottle of beer, area. There are 2 Tv's which usually has sports on (for you sports lovers) and a small bar where you can watch the chefs make sushi. If you are on a sushi fix, I recommend purchasing the \"all you can eat\" sushi menu. It is worth the price you pay! Noise level can get loud when there's a big sports event on TV.",

Our waitress was super friendly and nice; actually, all the waitresses were awesome.  I love the service and the food.  Our favorites are: Island Roll, Dragon Roll, Tuna Belly, Ahi Poke, Octopus Kim Chi. We ate more than $150 worth, but only paid the awesome price of $25/person.    We ate so much, we passed out in the car.  That didn't stop us from having the same sushi craving the next day.  Love Island Sushi!!!  We'll be sure to make it a ritual to come here every time we're in Vegas.",

    "text": "My cousin took us (and about 10 other members of my family) here for dinner.  3 stars for quality of food and additional star for selection of food. We all got the all you can eat sushi, and for 10 fatties, it was a great deal.. 90 minute time limit was more than enough to stuff our faces with sushi.  I have to admit that the Nigiri was totally worth it.. fish to rice ratio was great.  Big pieces of fish with smaller amounts of rice made the hamachi nigiri a go-to favorite of the night.  Another must is the eggplant fries! My boyfriend isn't a sushi fan, but he loved the garlic chicken and the eggplant fries.   Another aspect on their menu is the malasada sundae... and their desserts in general.  A lot of sushi places just have green tea or mochi ice cream as a dessert... Island Sushi has tempura ice cream, brownie sundaes... yum.   I would definitely come back on my next Vegas vacation.",

I love the Surf and Turf roll, Town and Country roll, and Big Island Roll, HOLY MAMA! The all you can eat menu is fabulous. The only thing is it's really hard to get a table. Once the big Hawaiians show up they ain't leaving until there times up. They sushi guys are awesome and Erin the waitress is super cool. When I'm not in the mood to be a cow, fried noodles are yummy, avocado poke bowl with taro chips are healthy good, garlic chicken plate is delicious and flavorful, the teri burger broke da mouth, and the custard pie hits the spot. I love this place! An absolute gem :)",

    "text": "I would have rated 2 stars, but because of the Sunday Brunch with added pupus/apps, it deserves the 3rd star.   I know it's called Island Sushi, and the owner is from Hawaii, but, I don't care much for the raw fish, sushi, or rolls here. I swear I've tasted much better, fresher fish. in addition, they DROWN their rolls in a watery, too sweet, unagi sauce. (I'm used to the kabayaki unagi sauce, which is dark and rich, and found at most other sushi restaurants here in Vegas,) The only roll that I can remember from here is the Candy Cane Roll, but, still, it's no big thing. But, in any case, I return here with my boyfriend every once in a great while to fill my tummy with pupus/appetizers galore! The selection of appetizers that they offer is VAST in comparison to many other sushi bars ON SUNDAYS. I like the mochiko chicken, eggplant fries, and their tempura sauce! It is sweeter than most places, which i happen to like as well. The Sunday list changes a lot, and it includes mini desserts too. I always get a creme brulee to finish.  The service is decent at best, some waitresses a little friendlier than the others, and the decor, is... well, i don't know how you would call it, but I guess, they're trying too hard for the local island feel. I am definitely not fond of the digital photo frames up next to our table, showcasing various rolls,random groups of people, and, then, seeing it in a never ending loop from the corner of your eye!   In any case, you just might find me there eating a plate lunch on the grill side. ;)",

The food was amazing as always, 3 rolls 4 beers and a sake for $50 and the only way they went wrong was the waitress....",

The Food I must say lacked flavor.  I ate the Mochiko Chicken and the Beef stew and they could use more flavor in the dishes.  It was pretty bland.   A few days later I decided to try the Sushi side and again it wasn't great but not bad.  the Rice was overcooked and they did not use enough sugar in their sushi rice vinegar which made it a little bitter.  and anyone who is a lover of great sushi knows the rice is the most important ingredient to sushi not the fish.  oh by the way the salmon was really bland.    I decided to take home some baked goods home so I can eat it after at home..  I got some Malasadas, a custard pie and guava cake.. I took it home and decided that i couldn't wait and ate them immidiately.  i'm sorry but the malasadas was hard as a rock.  Not fluffy at all.  The custard pie was good except the crust was too salty.  and the cake was good also but the cake part was very dry.    It seems that they do not have any quality check going on at this restaurant.  or they just don't care.",

After ordering a few things we told the sushi chef what we liked and he gave us a few things to try, he was right on with that and it was very much appreciated!   Now this was about a week and a half ago and we wanted to try it again!!! I had to be at work in 45 minutes so me and my husband decided to met there for a quick bite to eat... My only complaint is that the sushi bar is way to small, there were only about 3 seats left at the bar, 2 were together and one alone. Its very close in there and so there was not enough room for us to squeeze in there cause it would not have been comfortable. (not to mention my husband has a huge aversion to sitting next to other tables or people at restaurants, if they try to sit us next to another table and there is an open restaurant he freaks out!) and we didnt have time to sit at a table and be served so we had to leave!   We will defiantly be back again, this place is good and the dessert is good too and included (808 dessert was amazing).  We ended up rushing over to The Ka for a quick bite, always a good place either as a 1st choice (which it usually is for us, but we wanted something new) or as a backup!",

The sushi here is really fresh, the food is great, and the service is awesome too. When I came here, the waiter even gave me a discount too because the sushi was taking a bit longer than usual to come out from the kitchen since the place was packed and the kitchen was a bit backed up. They even have my favorite chuka seaweed salad here too which you can order as much as you want.  Keep in mind there is a time limit on how long you can eat. I think it was 1.5 hours but I'm not sure if they will enforce it or not. Also, you can only have 1 order per person for the sweet shrimp and uni sushi.  Excellent food, excellent service, and not overpriced. Make sure to check this place out.",

The restaurant is split into two sections: the grill side - which serves casual meals - and the actual sushi restaurant. Their poke orders in the grill side are always fresh, and my favorite food to get from there is the spicy tuna bowl! As for the sushi restaurant, the AYCE may be a bit pricey, but everything - and I mean EVERYTHING - on the menu is included in it. My favorite appetizer from there is the fried oysters. If you're sitting at the bar, one of the chefs may make a surprise dish for you, if you're lucky. Rolls are either hit or miss - they may be some \"interesting\" sushi rolls, but the rolls that are hits are very tasty! Customer service is also very good. I've been there in large groups several times before, and they definitely know how to handle them!",

We love the crunch roll, the 007 and the rainbow roll.  Friends tell me there poke bowls are super good too!  Sitting area is pretty small so it's frequently a short wait to get in.",

    "text": "There are so many AYCE sushi options in Las Vegas, and there are a few good ones that I have found, but this place is one of my favorites, in spite of it being really out of the way from where I live.   I actually came here with classmates awhile back, and I was hooked on the friendly atmosphere and service, and the great food!  I love the mochiko chicken appetizer, even though I know I should be getting my belly full on the sushi and the rolls.  It is definitely a restaurant that is best to visit with at least 3+ friends, so everyone can order and sample more variety of their specialty rolls.  There has also been a 1/3 ownership change in the past few months, and minor menu update with additional items added to the menu offering. So when you go, try the new items and see if any will become your new favorites.  For me, I love the fried baby octopus and the dipping sauce that it is served with.  I dare say that it is the BEST baby squid dish of Las Vegas and would totally fit in on the menu of izakaya restaurants like Ichicha or Ita-Cho (in Los Angeles).  AYCE Price: Lunch-$20.99 Dinner-$24.95  Sundays from 11:30 AM - 3:00 PM Sushi & Pupu (Appetizer) Brunch All you can eat sushi plus Hawaiian pupu menu for $20.95 (Have yet to try this, but hopefully I will soon)  They also have a Hawaiian lunch plate style restaurant, which you would actually walk into before going through the entry way on the right into the sushi bar part of the restaurant.",

They have a lot of options on the menu with unique-- but good rolls. My favorite rolls are the rainbow, makaha, baked salmon and black widow. Hawaiian food options such as chicken katsu and garlic chicken. Plus appetizers are all you can eat too!! Bring on the shrimp tempura! If you're not hungry enough for AYCE there's different hours depending on the day that's half off sushi rolls which is also a great option, you just need to call in and figure out the times. I highly recommend this place!",

Food is good and I always get Poke in the back of the restaurant from Poke Express. (Side Note: I first started coming here because my uncle and the owner of Poke Express went to the same church in Oahu. The owner of Poke Express was a well known chef back in Food Land.) The one thing I always come back for is the Garlic Chicken plate and the malasadas. They just upgraded the restaurant so it seems like business is doing well!!",

From the very first taste tasting, we were blown away at the professionalism and quality of service provided! My spouse and I were coming in from out of state to have our wedding in Las Vegas and had many obstacles, especially finding the perfect caterer, but Zenshin made it an easy choice from the beginning.  The management was extremely personable and detailed in the services they provided. We never felt pressured into anything we did not want and they genuinely made us feel like we were their most important customers. Additionally, there was a vast variety of food on the menu, and every single thing we ordered was delicious! It was hard to narrow down the choices because we wanted everything on the menu after we experienced the taste tasting. On our wedding day, the caterers were all set up and ready to go at our venue when an hour before the wedding started we had to move the reception across town, not only were they flexible, the rushed over to set up at the new location and their execution was FLAWLESS and they did not miss a beat! Everybody loved their food, especially their sushi and desserts! Zenshin saved the day and I would recommend this staff any day of the week!",

    "text": "The search continues to find a good AYCE sushi restaurant in Vegas...and Island Sushi and Grill has been getting quite a lot of attention as of late.  We had to see what the fuss was all about as well, so we came on a Monday night to enjoy their $24.95/pp AYCE sushi dinner.  (Lunch is $20.99/pp.)    When you first walk through the doors, you'll find yourself at a walk up counter.  This is just the 'grill' part of the restaurant serving up lots of Hawaiian plate options.  If you make a right, you'll enter the 'sushi' part of Island Sushi and Grill and if you want AYCE, this is where you want to be.  After being seated and our beverage orders were taken, the waitress came by to ask if we wanted to start with any appetizers.  She also gave us a sheet and pen to fill out for our nigiri and sushi roll options.    Appetizers:  * Ahi Belly, Garlic Pepper Sauce (limit one order per person) - A small portion, but tasty! * Ahi Poki - Pretty good! * Deep Fried Geso - Our favorite was the deep fried baby octopus.  It comes in an order of three with a dipping sauce.  Pretty good stuff! * Edamame * Garlic Chicken * Hamachi Kama (limit one order per person) * Pork Gyoza * Raw Crab Poke (limit one order per person) * Tako Kim Chee Poke (limit one order per person)  Nigiri - They do give you small pieces of fish on small mounds of rice, which is a good thing. It's AYCE after all, so you can order more.  But it can be discouraging when you first see it. * Albacore * Amaebi (limit one order per person) * Garlic Tuna * Hamachi  * Hirame * Ika * Ikura * Saba * Sake * Scallop Mayo * Tai * Uni (limit one order per person)  Things we forgot to order because we were so full: Eggplant Fries, Fried Tofu Poke, Lomi Salmon, Mochiko Chicken, and Salmon Kama.  Everyone seems to rave about their rolls, but we're not big on rolls with just the two of us.  So, we didn't have any.  But if we were with a larger party, there were definitely a few that we would consider.  I wouldn't say their sushi is the highest quality, but I think people come because they do have a few other items like mochiko chicken, garlic chicken deep friend baby octopus, ahi poke, raw crab, tako kim chee poke, etc.  Like many AYCE sushi joints in Vegas, it's about what appetizers and cooked items are offered as well.  They are quite specific about any charges for leftover food - $1 for nigiri and $3 for an 8 piece roll.  So take you time when ordering, especially if you're ordering rolls.     You are limited on one dessert option per person.  Everyone talks about the 808 Special, so we got one of those.  It's a deep-fried banana, ice cream, fresh strawberries, whipped cream, and chocolate sauce.  But our favorite was the Malasada Sundae.  One very delicious malasada cut into four pieces, ice cream, whipped cream, and guava(?) sauce.  Service was quite efficient and the waitresses were friendly.  We didn't have to wait long at all for any of our orders, which is definitely a plus.  Beverages were refilled without having to ask and any empty plates were cleared quickly as well, so no complaints about service at all.  They also offer a frequent eater card, ten AYCE and you get one free.  What makes this place a real locals' place is all the specials they offer.  You can tell there are a lot of regulars here - families, couples, singles, etc.  Some are here for the grill menu to go or the sit down sushi.    Happy Hour: 50% off all sushi rolls + drinks specials Mondays to Saturdays: 3:00 PM - 5:00 PM, 9:00 PM - Close Sunday: 3:00 PM - 5:00 PM, 8:00 PM - Close  Ladies' Night: Drink Specials Only Wednesdays: 3:00 PM - Close  Drink Specials:  $3.00 Large Beer $2.25 Hot Sake $4.00 Saketini $1.50 Small Beer $2.00 Sake Bomb  Sushi & Pupu (Appetizer) Brunch: AYCE sushi plus Hawaiian pupu menu for $20.95 Sundays: 11:30 AM - 3:00 PM",

Dine in-They burn the food, let alone takes forever for them to cook your food.  They never have malasadas.  They dont get your order right.  They forget simple items that come with your plate.  Pre-order/pick up-They dont tell you that there is certain items are out and they cant make what you ordered till you get there to pick up your food but they try to charge you for it.  Heres a thought call the person back to let them know, you do ask for a telephone number.  They lost all of their good chefs to other locations.

This is probably the first resto with 3 different spots: plate lunches, poke, and sushi (a sushi resto to be exact). Think L & L , Tanioka's, and Sushi Twister all combined into one. Was the AYCE worth it? I think so. You can order anything on the menu with a limit of 2 for desserts. The poke was great and had that melt in your mouth texture. My dad ordered around 3-4 small bowls of poke alone. The sushi was pretty good but I think still not as good as Yama Sushi. The only thing that I would say negative about this place is that the male waiters in the sushi resto were not really \"waiters.\" They were pretty much  there to take your order and give you your food. I would expect a waiter or waitress to be at least a little engaging and I don't think once did the guy ask \"How was the food?\". But the food is good and I'll come back to try their plate lunches.  Note: You know when you are next to Hawaiian locals when you hear the table across from you say, \"Uncle, sooooo....how was California Hotel?\" LOL",

Nothing over the top or colorful. This is more of a neighborhood sushi bar to get your fix with sushi if you're not looking for anything over the top.  Came here twice with a group of friends who sat in the dining area and with a friend who sat at the bar. Both times seating was ready and available. Waitresses were nice and so were the chefs at the bar. The only dispute I have is with the miso soup. Way, *way* too salty for its own good. Everything else tasted great, though. Even though Island Sushi is A-OK, I wouldn't mind stopping by here again if I'm in the neighborhood.",

Beautiful.  Sarie had a few rolls, loving every bite. She did the classic Sarie rolls (California, Spicy Tuna). What can I say, she knows what she likes... The service is always crazy good. This time we were laughing at our girl's description of the size of the mochi balls. God bless! ('I've had bigger balls' she tells me) Oh! And they have an AYCE punch card you guys! She brought one out for me at the end of my feast. Buy 10 AYCE, the 11th is a freebie.  I was grateful, but somewhat perturbed that I had been 3 times so far and never knew about the punchie. But hey, this is ISLAND SUSHI we're talking about. My beautiful server went back in time for me and gave me credit for those times too. Oh yeah, you guys, oh yeah.  By the way, The Bear and I will be working on punchhole #4 on Sunday night, so you better have that beautiful sushi man warmed up and ready to roll on my Black Widow baby!",

I don't mean to sound cheap, but the principle of being a sushi place and charging for dipping sauce is ridiculous! I've been going here for almost two years and I have never been charged for ponzu sauce! And the charge isn't listed on their menu. Island Sushi should think about getting rid of this ridiculous charge.",

    "text": "I can't believe I've never left a review before!  I've been here for many than my check-ins have would indicate.  I've never eaten the sushi.  I usually dine on the grill side.   This is BY FAR the best Hawaiian food I've eaten in Las Vegas.  Most places I've been have been similar by and large, but this place excels.  I'll comment on my favorite dish: Kalbi  Kalbi is basically the same thing as Korean-style short ribs.  The meat is tender and is flavor-packed with each bite.  I could eat two portions without blinking an eye and I can't really eat a lot of red meat.    My other favorite thing that I crave is their macaroni salad.  The macaroni salads I get at most Hawaiian places are usually very similar and for the most part a little too mayonnaisy for me... good, but mayonnaisy.    The macaroni salad here is PERFECT.  First off, it's like a mix between potato salad and macaroni salad and not oozing mayo.    Now that I'm back in this area I will be going a lot more.  UPDATE:  This time I tried the Classic Loco Moco and it was by far the best Loco Moco I've ever eaten.  The hamburger steak you can tell was made in-house and was absolutely delicious and super tasty gravy.",

I've been away from home (Hawaii) for 7 years and was really looking forward to some good local food but it's definitely lacking. The coco puffs are absolutely terrible!

I do want to try the sushi side and the poke though, I'm still hopeful based on the reviews and pictures but I won't eat from the grill again.",

    "text": "So happy to finally have good poke again!!!  So this will be an initial review because the only item we got here was the poke.  Location 5/5: So the 5 rating is if you live in the south part of the valley. It's also very easily accessible, right off the 215 on eastern, you'll head south on eastern and its about a quarter mile to the left behind Taco y Taco, and Smashburger.  Da Local 4/5: its a little bit confusing when you go inside, there is a sushi bar to the right, then the entrees as soon as you come in to the left, and finally the poke all the way in the back.  Customer Service 2/5: Even though I'm a Hapa Haole I didn't feel any of the love when walking in, the employees inside didn't greet us. While my wife and I were standing in front of the cashier trying to figure out where the poke bowls where at, non of the employees behind the counter tried to help us out. There were two guys standing behind the counter yet not a single one greeted us or offered his assistance.  Now when we figured out the poke stand was in the back, the lady there was very helpful and did an excellent job, because of her they get a 2/5.  Da Poke 5/5: Da poke was on point I got the spicy poke and it tasted da bomb, flavor so good it broke da mouth!!! My wife got the spicy tuna avocado, hers was just as good! the Flavor brought me right back to the islands. Something to mention about their poke which is very important is that their poke comes from POKE EXPRESS, located in North Vegas, Uncle makes the best Poke in the valley and its great that his poke make it all the way over here.   PS: the presentation of the poke stand took me back to Tamuras.  Da Rice 3/5: it was alright nothing too yummy nothing too bad just alright, I wish they made sushi rice but hey now we know.  Da Price 5/5: In Oahu, if you go to tamuras a pound of spicy tuna poke is $15:99, here at this mainland establishment it's the same price! This made me so happy because the prices where the SAME!!! I was expecting this type of poke in the valley to be more expensive.  Overall go to this place if you live in the south part of the valley. My advice is to bring your own rice, Teri sauce, and crunch, then buy half a pound of poke and poke salad...now you have created your own poke bowl which will be the bomb as long as you know how to make bomb ass rice.   If your looking for a really nice establishment but are not brown don't expect nice service here, you know what don't even expect them employees to even look at you. There is no Aloha here and that breaks my heart. Next time I go will be just to get the poke and then get go eat at home.",

There's 3 small pieces of kalbi and one medium piece of tonkatsu, plus Mac or tossed salad for $9 something. Overall decent and what I expected, but could have been more.

They had a birthday party going along the back wall, other tables with patrons, two long tables that were not occupied, and then open spots at the bar. We had our baby in the car seat with us or we would have sat at the sushi bar.  15 minutes & each server that came by told us that we would be seated when the party LEFT. They hadn't even started cake..... It was 8:30 by this point and I'm almost positive they close at 9. So we would have been rushed through our meal, just like they did to us the last time. Again... Two open tables we STILL there. Needless to say, we ended up leaving. Last time we'll ever stop there again.  The FIRST time we ate there we were rushed through our meal. Mind you there was 5 of us doing all you can eat & 4 of them were eating and sending drinks to the sushi chefs for the awesome food. You'd think this would end up giving them a kick ass review right? Well, the servers began coming by and taking plates off our table that had sushi on it. Our friend who had a couple pieces left on his plate told the server he wasn't done and she put another plate over it and squished his food. We asked to speak to manager on duty and we were told they didn't have one and that we needed to pay our check and go. I then asked to speak to a manager again and was asked what for. I explained to the other server about how ours was so disrespectful. He came back with a poor excuse of a gift certificate that covered ONE entree..... Gee thanks.   Thought we'd give you another chance.... Won't be doing that again  Two stars for food",

Broth was light and there was a good assortment of wonton, bbq pork and imitation crab meat. I didn't leave full though, so that was the downfall. My coworker enjoyed the teriyaki chicken which he ate all of.  I know I will be back to get some chantilly cake to go! They have a pastry selection that looked pretty delish, but can be pricy at $4.50 a slice.   We were in and out in 30 minutes and everyone was quite friendly.",

I personally wouldn't recommend the oxtail soup. I asked the girl and she said that they just heat it up when ordered. I paid about 12.50 and I got 3 good pieces of meat/bone. I'm not sure if it was because it wasn't fresh, but I don't think the flavor of the broth was too great.  Other than that, I can't wait to come back and try their other dishes and even their sushi. I will definitely be back for more poke! :)",

Sometimes you'll get lucky and get to sit up at sushi bar and watch them make your sushi rolls. It is a place you'll see a lot of local people from hawaii in here as it is so called the 9th Island for a reason. Just keep the conversation going and hear the pigeon come out in most of the people in the Restruant.  Nothing like good food, mokes, hanging out with friends and family. This is how we normally do it the islands anyways. Enjoy the great sushi and service....... ALOHA! and Mahalos for letting me share.",

The food is consistently delicious and I love getting the teishoku or all you can eat sushi! The teishoku comes with a main dish (or 2 or 3 choices for a main), salad, California roll, miso soup, edamame and a dessert all for $11!! WHAT?!? Crazy reasonable ($11 is for a one choice) and I always have food to take home! There are a number of desserts to choose from to pair with your teishoku and I can never decide.  The alll-you-can-eat is $21.95 for lunch and $26.95 for dinner. Great deals no matter what as the food is always tasty and fresh and the service is fabulous! They have a bakery section when you first enter the restaurant with favorites of Hawaii, such as dobash cakes, cream puffs, chocolate and butter mochi by the slice, guava cake, custard pie, and several other goodies!!  If I could give 10 stars I would!! We'll be back for our sushi fix!!",

The first I had to send back which was a simple Mochiko chicken (burnt and flavorless) I changed my order to the BBQ mixed plate which was the special and that too wasn't good at all. The meat was so salty I almost choked! If I wasn't starving from a long hike and drove 30 min to try it, I would have sent it back. The manager never bothered to come out and say anything to me personally but instead just stood behind the counter giving me dirty looks. The reason this place gets two stars is because the Poke I ordered in the back was fairly good.  The cook should get dirty lickens or maybe the owner should for allowing them to serve the plate lunches as Hawaiian food. It may be good for Vegas but living in the islands for most of my life I wouldn't go here again.",

Hubs and I shared the eggplant plate and the mochico chicken and shrimp plate.  The eggplant had great flavor but was insanely oily...it just sat in an inch of bright orange oil in my Styrofoam box.  The chicken and shrimp were nothing special.  The meals were served with a scoop of white rice and mac salad as expected.    Everything was fine but I've definitely experienced better.

    "text": "I'm not the type to leave a Yelp review typically, but I was so dissatisfied with their service that I felt the need to voice my opinion. I walked in at 9:30 (30 minutes before they are supposed to stop seating people). The hostess told me that all you can eat has ended already but told me I can still order sushi rolls for half price. We ended up sitting down anyways and I order 2 rolls... But then I try to order more and they refused to serve me. They said that they already put the food away and they are done making food for the night, yet there was still 20 minutes left to order food. They didn't even warn me that they were closing the sushi bar or offer to make me anything else before closing down. The sushi wasn't bad but I was extremely disappointed with the customer service. They lied to us and were too lazy to even serve me when they were supposed to be open. Worst service I have ever had. Next time I'm hungry for sushi I'll make sure Island Sushi is my last resort.",

They have very good customer service, they are on top of everything and very polite! I sat at the bar where you can watch them make the sushi rolls before your eyes! I tried Saki for the first time & I have to say it was AMAZING! Definitly coming back to this place often! Only thing I did not like is how small and crowded it feels in there! Overall though I don't mind it because their Sushi is certainly worth every second!",

Da firs time I came hea I was all stoked cuz da peepo on da bento/poke side when sound like me and was brown like me!  Since I when leave da 8o8 I been real homesick.  Brah, I was so happy I when find dis place!  Dey when rep aloha and I couldn't wait for go back. And deeen I went back.  Except dis time we went da sushi side.  Aye lawd, these chicks lucky my potagee maddah nevah come wit me cuz she woulda had one field day wit da pilau customer service.  We did da all you can eat sushi, but first da wahine when embarrass us, announcing to da whole place dat we when order choke food.  Den da rest of our visit, she when fly da plates at us and  den grab da empty ones off our table without sayin one word!  She nevah ask us if we like order more, she never ask us if we like more watah, nevah ask us if we like napkin, nothin!  She when drop/grab da plates den run away!  Da two wahines workin dat night only when cater to da peepo reppin da 808 shirts or all moked out.  Real unreal, i trip. As fo da grindz, was okay.  Get fat pieces in da rolls, and da soups is winnahz.  But if you like drink watah, bettah wear your aloha shirt or else nevah mine!  IN OTHER WORDS:  The customer service on the sushi side sucked.  If you want good customer service, you better wear an HI/AlohaArmy or a tribal print shirt.  Where the food lacked in quality, they made up for it in quantity (the rolls are pretty large).  I recommend the the miso and udon, they're pretty good.  Their desserts are cute and tasty, wish I got to try the malasadas!",

I did all you can eat both times during lunch  and there's an hour time period. Service: 0 out of 10 The service was horrible, to the point where I kinda just wanted to up and leave. We ordered our food and after 20 minutes there was still no food. I gave them some leeway as we ordered a lot of dishes and it was kinda busy. Around the 30 minute mark our food came out but by that point we were already kind of annoyed. I spied at the corner of my eye that a table that got there after I did had gotten their food on the spot and that annoyed me even more. After we had finished our food there we wanted to order again but waving down to staff to give our ticket too was impossible. By this point a lot of the other tables had left and there weren't that many people anymore which left me confused as to why they couldn't see my hand waving a piece of paper in front of their faces. They also missed some of our orders and we left rushed and disappointed. Food: 7 out of 10 The food was the saving grace of the day. The crunch roll was amazing to the point where we ordered four and devoured them all. The candy cane roll was also good and kinda sweet which is a plus for me. Everything else was so-so.",

    "text": "The second day of debauchery in Vegas involved the all-you-can-eat sushi lunch buffet. This place was absolutely amazing. For $20.99 for lunch, you can eat unlimited appetizers, unlimited sushi rolls and nigiri, and one dessert.  We came here STARVING. It was around 2pm, and we had just come back from swimming in the nice pool garden at the Venetian. So believe me when I say that we were incredibly hungry. The server took our order for appetizers, and we got miso soup, edamame, mochiko chicken, shrimp tempura, and maybe a few other things I don't remember. The shrimp tempura is only two pieces per order, so order several if you actually want to eat a decent amount. And who cares, it's unlimited anyway.  Notable rolls: Black Widow and the Mauna Loa. Although to be honest, we tried everything that had soft shell crab in it and that was amazing too. We must have put through a gajillion orders of rolls and they got vanquished within two minutes of being placed on the table. The nigiri came last, and avoid the squid because it's super rubbery. The salmon was decent, and that's pretty much all I tried because I was saving room for dessert.  I have made quite the convenient pairing, because the boyfriend doesn't like dessert and doesn't believe in always having room for it. I, meanwhile, had room for two desserts (I learned my lesson after the Mirage incident, see previous review). So I took my tempura ice cream (with vanilla ice cream, it was delicious) and then I took his green tea ice cream, which was a great way to round out the meal. After that, boy, was I full.  I would come here again in a heartbeat. The fish is great, the sweet sauce they use to cover it is not too overbearing, and for all you can eat, this can't be beat. I would take a taxi from the strip and endure the $$$$ cab ride just to eat here again.",

The hostess offered to seat us at the sushi bar because that was the only seating available. We said sure. Upon seating down my sense went into overdrive.   First: My chair was rocking back and forth and felt like it could collapse at any moment.  Second: The fish in front of us, the fish being used to make sushi, was not looking so hot.  Third: The smell coming from the fish made me sick to my tummy.  Fourth: The view we had of the kitchen, the one preparing raw fish, was dirty, dirty, dirty.  That was all it took. My husband looked at me, we both said \"okay\", got up and walked out.",

Their side dishes are really good you'll have to try all of  them . They also have over 20 rolls to choose from they kind of cut it tiny but i guess thats good if you want to try alot of their rolls.  i recommend the CANDYCANE roll:]           GESO!! omgahh you cannot go here without getting gesos (which are baby octopus goodness!)   The only down side would be their nigiri. Last time i ate there the salmon wasnt fresh :[. but sometimes it is. but if this place isnt all that if your crazy for nigiri ive had way better quality in other sushi joints. Also their service could be slow and youll have to be patient if there is alot of people, their really nice though.  But other than that this placeee is really really YUMMMY!!  The sushi chef even gave me and my boyfriend complimentary SAKE BOMBS!! woot.   and again. TRY THE GESO!!!",

We placed our original order (All You Can Eat) and  waited 20 minutes or so to receive it. Half of our order was brought out and watched as people came in after us starting receiving food we initially ordered. We asked the waiter but he didn't seem to care & never brought us the rest of our food. One person in our party received two items he ordered and that was it. We spoke to the Manager (Jesus) about the horrible service and he offered a 10% discount off ONE dinner, what an insult to us. I definitely wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone that is looking for good food and service. why would you insult your customer, instead of making it right and fixing the situation. There are many good restaurants to choose, why pick one that doesn't understand the value of customer service.",

    "text": "Came with the whole family to eat here for AYCE sushi lunch on Sunday afternoon and to my surprise with no wait..   I like how you can get AYCE sitting at a table & not only at the bar like how most Cali sushi places are.. super plus!  And unlike most AYCE sushi places in California (specifically the valley area) the food here was great and is sooo much better than the sushi i'm used to.   I liked how there was 3 pgs of food (basically everything) from the menu to choose from on the AYCE.. plus being Sunday there was a \"brunch\" option that included a few Hawaiian breakfast and special sushi options.  Try the Lechon from that menu!! It was f*cking delish, chopped crunchy pieces of pork with a vinegarry-soy sauce and pieces of onion and tomatoes, we had to order it 3 times it was so good! We really loved the yellowtail sushi, Salmon Sushi w/ Orgasm sauce, Kona roll, and especially loved that we got to try the Poke on the AYCE menu (limit 1 order each).  There was this roll with a sliver of jalapeno on top and sriracha that was freakin the best.. just can't remember the name of it.   Service-wise they were all awesome.. perhaps it was because we were a party of 7  and for groups of 5+ there's an automatic service charge of 18% so be advised of that.. but honestly they deserved it because they were so friendly and on it with the refills of drinks and the plates came out to us fast AF.  I love that sh*t, thank you! Will have to come here every time i'm in Vegas from now on.",

Did not care for the Mickey's Rice and IMO, if you are doing AYCE, you want to stay away from this because it is filling. Son loves the mochiko chicken and gets at least 2 each visit. My favorite roll is the Chuy. Favorite dessert is the 808 Special but the Brownie Delight comes in a close second.  Sometimes service seems a little slow and/or unorganized.  Sushi Chefs are always welcoming and greet many of the guests. Expect to wait at peak times as seating area is small. Any items besides the rolls may take a bit to get to the table it seems so order those ASAP before choosing your sushi so it can get started.",

Do the all you can eat cause a couple rolls and appetizer are same or more than the 21.95 price of AYCE",

We ordered 2 bentos and spam musubis and they came out hot and fresh for our appetites. The cashier or server KRISLYN rudely slammed our food and forks on our table like she didn't care and she lacked manners. I'm easy to please and usually let things slide but the way she treated my partner and I actually bothered me. I'm not sure if she was having a bad day or if she was too busy but she should know better than to slam customers' meals on the table and she also didn't explain which order is which that I had to go up and ask another server which bento had mochiko chicken and which had garlic chicken. No one there seemed welcoming AT ALL.  I'm more likely to return since I loved the food but I really DON'T want to experience a repeat of that shitty service. The ALOHA spirit here during this one visit was nonexistent. First impressions are LASTING impressions so I'll take a deep breath and kind of expect bad service here again even though I love the food.",

They seem to be always busy, but we never have to wait long to be seated. The restaurant is a little small and at times I feel cramped next to the party next to me, but it is a busy place! I wish they could move to a bigger location or combine the grill and restaurant together for a bigger space! Anyways, you must try their dragon roll and baked salmon roll! Both a must have. Also they have happy hour pretty much every day! I'm not sure the exact times, but just call and find out!",

You order at the counter first and they will bring your meal to the table.  We went during dinner time and there was 10 people already in line.  There's a sushi only section on the other side of this restaurant.  Crowds of people always stand in line to eat here.  We will have to go back and try their sushi next time.    The oxtail soup has a different tasting broth.  It's more like an udon tasting broth which we found to be very interesting.  The oxtail meat was very fatty which also made the broth quite oily.  My meat had A lot of fat attached versus what I would get at the California hotel.  Quality was lacking but it was good enough for us to eat for dinner at a reasonable time.    The chicken Kutsu was prepared just right and I am enjoyed eating this more than the ox tail soup.  The poke was good for what you'd get in Vegas where it is nowhere close to an ocean!  My mother-in-law got the garlic chicken and that was very flavorful!  Overall I would come here again when I'm visiting Vegas.  Good comfort food but avoid prime dinner hours!",

Prices per lb has definitely gone up. It is now $16/lb for the fish and $14/lb for tako. It used to be cheaper which is why I'm giving it a 3-star. Another reason is the quality has decreased a bit. I only got the poki - ahi, salmon, and tako. Sauce, fish, tako are all delicious however, they are not as nicely marinated as they used to be. Poki fish pieces are not cut into smaller cubes - which should make you think more surface area or marination but no. Tako pieces are actually chopped into bigger pieces and also not as flavorful as it was before. Place is clean and service was good.",

    "text": "First time eating here.  Decided to try it out based on a pretty good yelp rating and seeing all the food on IG. Service was awesome.  The counter help and the Poke guy in the back helped us out and answered our questions with a smile.  Ordered our food and it came out in a timely manner.  I ordered the Fried  Noodle Combo with Mochiko Chicken.  The chicken was crispy, juicy, and flavorful.  The rice, noodles, and Mac salad was less desirable.  The rice was hard, noodles were soggy and wasn't seasoned, and the macaroni in the mac salad had a weird texture.  My son had the corned beef hash breakfast.  He loved it except for the rice.  Same situation as my plate, the rice was hard.  My wife and daughter ordered Poke bowls.  The presentation was nice.  My wife enjoyed the sushi rice, my daughter not so much.  Poke had good flavor and the sides were good too.  Fresh and crisp Pickled cucumber and Crispy Taro chips.  The portions of the actual poke itself was disappointing.  It was about 2 teaspoons of fish.  We probably will order it by the pound next time.  We also ordered a dozen Malasada's.  6 haupia and 6 chocolate.  These Buggahz was MEEEEEAAAN!  No complaints here.  Aloha....",

There are two sides to the restaurant: a sushi side and what they call the \"grill\" side. I haven't been over to the sushi side yet, but can say that the grill side's food is great. Won ton min, poke bowl, loco moco, mix plate...all grindz. I'll also usually pick up a half dozen of their malasadas to take home; not quite Leonard's, but they're warm and hit the spot. However, I didn't care for the guava or chantilly cake when I got them.   We live in Summerlin but drive all the way to Henderson to eat here, because it's a little piece of the islands on the 9th island.",

    "text": "This used to be one of favorite Hawaiian/sushi places but the last few times I have ordered, the food wasn't that great.  The rice was over cooked, so mushy which made everything soak into it. For example the loco moco, the gravy soaked into the rice and made it even more mushy. Same with the sushi, the rice wasn't as great as other sushi joints, it lacked love and flavor. It could've been a bad day and that's ok, we all have our off days.   I believe the hardest way to keep the flavor and the food the best is when it's delivered. Postmates is a God send but the food doesn't taste as if I sat down there to eat a good meal.   My girlfriend and I order a lot of food from this place, whether it's the sushi, the desserts, the entrees or the poke, it varies.   I do have to say the poke is some of the best!",

I've been dining here for years and it is one of my favorite Hawai'an - 9th island restaurants in Vegas. I always feel like I'm back home when I'm here.   This review is mainly for the grill side of Island Sushi & Grill. I have had AYCE sushi here during Sunday Brunch and it was good, but it was a while back (5+ years ago). At that time it was a good price, lots of options for rolls and breakfast food. It may have changed since then.   GRILL SIDE:  - My favorites are the korean chicken, garlic chicken, chicken & eggplant, & teri beef plates.   - The ahi plate is a bit dry but can be improved.   - The malasadas are great. Freshly made and an assortment of filled malasadas to choose from: chocolate, haupia, and custard.   I love the renovations. It looks great! I like the option of quick service on the grill side with tables to dine in as well. I usually order takeout by phone and swing by to pick up when it's ready.",

The restaurant splits on one side you have sushi and the other you have local Hawaiian food with poke. The parking lot isn't huge but good enough.  Never had a hard time parking.",

    "text": "We stopped coming here after they burned our Kalbi order when my in laws were in town. The first time they came to visit, everything was perfect, we ate here two days in a row!   The second time they came to visit from CA, my husband went to pick up our takeout order. He got home, and all the meat was burned. I called to see if they could replace the order. They asked us to come back to the store with all of the food... Pieces of meat were eaten by my kids, so the \"manager\" at the time said something to the effect of \"it must have not been that bad,\" and would not replace the meals. Super disappointing. I left telling them we would never come back.   It's been over a year since we last ate there.  Maybe things are different, but since I stopped spending my money here, we have found much better places for AYCE sushi and kalbi plates.  Update:   Thank you Terence for your response to my review.   However, as a customer, I feel like if I order take out for pick up, over the phone, and send my husband to pick it up, do I really need him to hold up your staff, make them untie all the bags, pop open every take out container to make sure the cook staff did not burn my food? No. That's YOUR STAFF'S JOB. Quality control. What are you paying them for?  When we order takeout there is usually quite a few containers. I have three kids, they eat a lot of Kalbi.   Way to push the incident back on the customers. I will continue to drive by your establishment...",

I don't know if maybe the food wasn't prepared right but something was off about the food that night. Brought the food home. Wife, son and myself all ate and instantly my wife and I felt like crap after eat a quarter of our plate. I thought maybe I ate too fast but throughout the night, I was in and out the bathroom. Next day, my wife said she still felt very nauseous and just full but not in a good way and I felt the same way. My son on the other hand, got it worst than us. He ate half his mini plate the night before and the half for breakfast the next day. That's the only thing he ate until dinner time. Around 5/6pm he starts throwing up and going to the bathroom. I'm writing this review at 2:53am after my son just settled and fell asleep from using the bathroom again. Like I said, the food is usually great but just that particular night something wasn't right. Probably won't be going back sucks to say since my son loves that place.",

Once we walked in it was like hello, hello, welcome, welcome..There were so many workers there greeting us. I think that's normal though. They're a friendly bunch.  I wasn't too hungry so I didn't order anything but did try a few things from others. The poke bowl looks so good. The Tuna was on point and delicious and abundance. The plain ahi poke was also good but a bit too much soy sauce for me. Tasted salty.   The service was good and the food came fast. The main thing I liked was the malasadas. They did it right. It was fresh and hot and fluffy. We got the plain ones without filling and dang it was the best thing I ate all day. So good.   Side note: We came on our last day in Vegas and got some Malasadas to go. It was not the same at all. Was pretty disappointed. So when you do go get it ask for the fresh out of the fryer ones. =)",

    "text": "I don't know how I have not reviewed this place, I eat here more often then I should for my waistline. This review is for their grill side since I have not gone to their sushi spot in years so can't judge it. The grill side has a small amount of seating,  but it's set up more for takeout while the sushi side is more of a restaurant.   I do recall the sushi side had half off happy hour prices on certain days,  so I recommend investigating that before you go for that specifically.   So back to the grill... First of all this place is the best place to get poke.  Super fresh, great selection of flavors,  and although I have only ordered by the pound, I saw they now also hopped onto the poke bowl and burrito band wagon.    Their mac salad is possibly my favorite of all the Hawaiian restaurants in town,  and their garlic chicken is fried perfectly, so juicy, while packing a level of flavor that makes me happy dance when I devour it.  One item you can't miss is their malasadas,  it is a Portuguese donut that became popular and adopted in Hawaiian cuisine.   Fluffy round donuts rolled in sugar, and I always get mine filled with custard.   Their vanilla custard is so perfect and creamy.  It's honestly my favorite donut in the valley.  I have tried the haupia filling, but I found it a bit bland, and had a slightly off taste.   Overall this is the most solid Hawaiian restaurant I have been to,  and I find myself craving it often. Even when I go visit Hawaii I find myself preferring items here, so they are legit,  and I am so glad I live by them.",

I had to take a picture and send to all my peeps! Overdone dry tasteless just bad.   Update:  Food still wonderful but the service is going down hill- there's a local girl in there that's good but everyone else up front either needs more training or needs to go if they don't enjoy their jobs and have attitude or face all the time is time to get someone who really wants to be there and has the Aloha spirit the same way the food does!!  Also wanted to mention the poke section very fresh awesome flavor!  I love love love their noodles wet or dry they season perfectly and give lots, the Mochi chicken teri chicken just about everything on the menu is good!!! The sushi some is great and some not too good the use paste roll for example not so good.  The malasadas and mochi is good but don't order the chantilly cake! The cake is dry and tasteless and it is not chantilly!  You should be shame for calling it that! All in all I eat here all the time and it's worth it! I give the food 10 of 10 and desserts 7",

The Cajun in the Cajun albacore went back to Louisiana; this one had no spice and it had more of a perfume or flower flavor.  The highly recommended garlic chicken was ok.",

I always get bento box C with garlic chicken. It comes with rice, noodles, 3-4 pieces of fried chicken dipped in a sweet, slightly garlicky teriyaki-like sauce a slice of spam, and a slice of pickled radish. Small bento less than $6. Then go to the back and get the smallest size of the spicy Aki combo: Comes with ahi tuna, avocado, green onions, artificial crab, and spicy mayo. Makes for a delicious meal!",

We were enjoying our dinner up until my spouse found a dead baby fly floating in his soup. We immediately brought it to one of the servers attention and he brought it to the back. The manager David came straight out and offered us two options, to make us one fresh batch or a gift certificate for the amount of one oxtail soup. My spouse looked at me and we were both very confused. Being that we are cooks ourselves, we did not want to cause a scene, give no attitude or be rude because we understood that things go wrong. However, things like this should never be acceptable or taken lightly. I expected a full refund for both our meals but he only offered to compensate one. I believe that both our soups came from the same pot. Again, with no attitude or rudeness, we simply walked out of that restaurant. We could not stomach the way the situation was handled and it ruined our entire night. Especially since we drove 35 mins to their restaurant just for their oxtail soup.",

So far, of all the sushi restaurants we have been through, Island Sushi has the best uni!! The service was excellent and the manager was kind enough to check up on us as well as all other customers.

    "text": "I can't believe that I haven't written a review on this wonderful establishment. Every time I have mainland family visiting, a stop at this restaurant is a must. In Nov 2014, I think I spent over $200 visiting this restaurant because of all the family we had visiting.  I have been coming to this restaurant for the past four years, before I even moved to Vegas. Two reasons why:  1. I'm a noodle head and they have really good fried noodles. Noodles like I used to get from the manapua truck when I was a kid but with more char sui, spam and kamaboko 2. The POKE deli in the back. As far as I know, this is the only restaurant that has this, similar to all the supermarkets from HI. You can sample some of the different pokes they have. You even can choose to get a 1/4 lb of poke. This allows you to get all kinds of poke to taste!  And honestly, I would say that this is the original poke restaurant in Las Vegas. Although poke is the current trend in Las Vegas and all these poke bowl restaurants are opening up. If you want authentic, original Hawaiian style poke, come here. Forget the rice and all the vegetables and load up on poke. Before I forget, the poke counter closes early than the restaurant, at 8pm.  One of my family favorites, malasadas. When you visit this restaurant, be sure to put your order in asap as it does take time to fry up these bad boys. Try the different filled flavors. Be sure you leave room for these delights at the end of your meal as it is best when it is fresh.  And they did renovate the \"carry out\" portion of the restaurant. When I visited the restaurant last week, my family of 12 got there as soon as they opened up. We were able to take up two rows of tables with plenty of room for other patrons.  Because this is an extremely popular restaurant for the \"9th Islanders\", it is important that you plan ahead. Lunch, dinner and weekends, this place is poppin'.",

Typically service is great,  especially if you sit at the sushi bar.    Now on to the food...my favorite rolls are the Japanese lasagna, maui wowie, and tempura rolls. For apps I like beef teri, and the tempura.  When you go for brunch,  try the spam pancakes.  They're incredible. For finishers, I'm a big fan of the Malasada sundae. Sooo goooood.",

What ended up happening was the restaurant changed the rules during the challenge and kept the new information secret from all the eaters, out of fear everyone would stop eating. The funny thing is the dude they declared the winner aka 'last man standing' had been knocked out cold by the challenge 20 minutes prior to the time expiring. He sat there staring at all six scoops of rice, macaroni salad and malassada unable to continue and ended being declared the winner, all the while it was me who pushed through the pain like a True warrior eating until the point of no return. I finished everything except a couple scoops of rice. Even if they had added what I reversed to my plate and weighed it I still would have slaughtered the losers weight total by close to three pounds if not more and they had the asinine nerve to declare him the winner. I'm the True champion of this challenge and that is a fact that only a fool would dispute.",

Unfortunately there was a big change and I didn't realize Poke Express was no longer there. It looks exactly like Poke Express same setup and all,  but according to Yelp they moved? I got a poke bowl. The employee helping me was already wearing a glove when he came up to me to ask what I would like to order. I noticed him sweating, which always grosses me out because that means sweat has to be wiped and it is usually with a hand or arm. Gross. I ordered by bowl and he used the hand with the glove to make the poke bowl packing in the lettuce multiple times with that gloved hand. Later he took my cash with that same hand with the glove. I sat down and saw he still had on the glove and began to wipe down the area where food was being served. Then he proceeded to take a woman's order after me using that same glove that touched money, a dirty rag, and who knows what else! So disgusting! I am highly disappointed because Poke Express was my go to poke spot when I wanted poke that reminded me of Hawaii. It appears this poke spot is in the same location but the owner is the same for the whole store. I asked someone at the front and they confirmed it is not a different business. I called and spoke to a manager after and he said he would talk to the guy and that he is new but honestly there is no excuse. People can get really sick and I won't be coming back here.",

I order for pick up sometimes and they get so busy, you'll get frustrated waiting longer than what you're told over the phone when you get there. I don't know the girl's name, but she's always the one ringing me up at the take out register. She's always giving me a weird bitchy vibe.   Poke is hit or miss as far as the fishy taste. When it's not pungently fishy, I enjoy my occasional Shoyu Poke which I blend with some seaweed salad over a bed of warm white rice.",

    "text": "not sure what's happening with ISG but my last visit was terrible. this review is based solely on my visit on 7-20 @ 9:05pm I was craving a nice HOT bowl of saimin, hubby was agreeable so we stopped in at ISG. we both ordered the saimin deluxe with 4 extra wontons each and 6 vanilla malasadas. we sat ourselves and waited for our soup. and waited. and waited. 20 mins later we got of food. I understand if it was busy, but we were the only ones waiting and the other table was already eating. okay, whatever. I can get past this because their food is good. grabbed my spoon and dug in. and said WTF?!!??! this was lukewarm broth with cold wontons and cold char siu. I couldn't take another bite and took my bowl back up to the counter and asked them to please do something with this cause it's not hot. got it back 5 mins later - soup was warmer but a few wontons were still cold and stuck together. I just shook my head and ate. hubby's soup was no better but he was starving and just ate the noodles and char siu, left everything else.     it's so disappointing especially when you expect a certain level of service and quality of food. I don't think HOT soup is too much to ask for, no matter what time you come into an establishment. I'm sure each item/ingredient was refrigerated and heated as needed/per order, and that's fine, but what's not okay and unacceptable is to serve soup without making sure everything has come to proper temperature and is out of the food danger zone.",

The rolls were also really, really good. They just seemed of better quality and lighter than what I am used to back home. The AYCE menu is vast with many options. Great experience and very affordable.",

For the kids, they were excited to see Grandma & Grandpa...as for my wife and I, well, we wanted to stuff our faces.   Sushi Mon has been our spot for years but after some lobbying from my parents, we decided to give Island Sushi a shot... Plus, Sushi Mon can get SOOO crowded and busy sometimes. We ate at Island Sushi for my birthday and again about 3 days later. We were gonna go to Sushi Mon but I thought: \"Island Sushi's a Hawaiian sushi joint, so why not patronize my people, right?\"   Needless to say, we were not disappointed! First off their Sushi Buffet is cheaper than Sushi Mon. Second, they have that \"local\" taste. (Hawaiian-mainland transplants know what I talking about) Everything on the menu is O-N-O! Check out the pics I uploaded! Only thing I didn't take a picture of was the Garlic Mochiko chicken...we ate it so fast, I didn't have a chance! My personal favorite was the \"Island Special\"... Soft shell crab, topped with spicy tuna and eel sauce (sweet, creamy sauce) HO!!! Buss yo' Mowt!!! And it's all you can eat!!! That's just nutz... The owners name is Dean and he's a real cool, down to earth guy. He even brought out our orders when our waitress was busy...   Well, if you're ever in town or you live Vegas and wanna try out a new Sushi Buffet, you gotta check out Island Sushi!",

I know that quantity is not a substitution for quality, but Island was lacking.   The fish to rice ratio was good. Some of the fish came out at an alarming temperature. Felt that they were dangerously warm, as if they were not properly stored. The nigiri are smaller than other places, but that is usually better. If you like something, you can just order more, instead of getting a huge lump of rice. The rice also fell apart easily.   The one roll I tried, the croc, was small. I am used to soft shell crab rolls to be bigger and filled to the brim with crustacean-y goodness.   The best dishes were the side dishes. The ahi poke, garlic chicken, and seaweed salad were delicious, but can be found elsewhere.   The service was decent. Our waitress put in our order in a timely fashion, got refills once in a while, and took away dirty plates promptly.",

If you want great sushi go to Yama Sushi.  As for the grill side, the food is horrible. I had the Kalbi ribs and the teriyaki chicken. The Kalbi ribs tasted like old meat... it was gross. The teriyaki chicken had no teriyaki flavor whatsoever and it did not even come with teriyaki sauce. Also, the macaroni salad was the worst Hawaiian mac salad I have ever tasted. It was extremely bland. The food was so horrible it seemed as if it was prepared this way on purpose to keep people away. I just don't see how they could make the food so bad!  If you want good Hawaiian food go to Aloha Kitchen. I have tried tons of other Hawaiian joints and I keep going back to Aloha.  As for the service, it is decent. It does seem as if the service is steadily declining though.",

Their traditional rolls are good, but I recommend branching out and trying the Hawaiian fusion rolls. The Town & Country and Big Island rolls are both phenomenal, and the ahi belly is some of the best i've ever had. For desert, I've enjoyed the 808 special and the malasada sundae and thoroughly enjoyed them both.   I will definitely return!",

I do not eat meat and specifically ordered a vegetable roll and they gave me shrimp roll. Went back inside and re ordered. Left again in my car driving away when I checked again. Wrong again!!! I had to drive back come back inside as they gave me a slight attitude. As if i shouldn't be mad I've spent an hour here trading my food and haven't ate today.  I also ordered chicken katsu for my nephew which they were going to let me keep the old katsu that has been sitting for an hour already. Lastly someone came up to me saying that I bit into one of the wrong orders. Seriously furious. This place sucks and the management sucks do not come !",

I was surprised at how low the prices were.   The 007 was delicious! The fish all tasted fresh and they threw in a side of eel sauce for me without me even requesting it. I also ordered the Spicy Tuna roll and although it wasn't spicy enough for me, it was still tasty.   They put the dressing on the side for the cucumber salad so I didn't have to worry about the cucs being soggy. Overall, I was pleased. I'll have to try out the restaurant next time, I hear they have amazing desserts!",

This is another place that feels like home and the staff are always friendly and welcoming  I will be totally honest and say that I prefer sticking to the Sunday Brunch offerings and not so much their AYCE Sushi items. Flat out, the quality is just not as fresh as it should be, and I could really tell the difference as I have consumed a few thousand pieces here in Vegas alone.(True story!!!) That first order of nigiri was our last, and I just told the Chef that we were sticking to the brunch stuff.  He didn't seem too enthused about it, but hey, I ain't taking that kind of risk. I can't believe others at the bar eating sushi didn't detect that pretty sketchy quality. Anyway, back to the brunch items. We killed a good number of items from the whole list of offerings, like  Island Sushi Roll 008 Roll Red Velvet Pancakes X4 Hawaiian Sweet Bread French Toast X2 Egg in a Basket with Bacon Kim Chee Clam Dip with Malassada Chips Tempura Green Beans with Wasabi Nori Ranch Cold Ginger Chicken with Cilantro Pesto Chicken Curry Salad on malassada Chip Kim Chee and Lup Cheong Fried Rice Grilled Mongolian Beef Tips Crispy Pork Belly Bun Green Tea Tiramisu Vanilla Creme Brulee Cocoa Puff Malassada with Passionfruit Cream Cucumber and Melon Granita  All plates are tapas portions, and you can order as little or as many as you like. Sadly, the Cocoa Puff and Malassada kina come up short and I goitta wait to go home for the real deal at Leonard's and Liliha....ALOHA!!!  YELP 365 CHALLENGE-(261/365) \"Sunday Brunch Bash\"",

I will not put our first server on blast but our second server made up for it, she was ok. 2) we were seated aprox 20mins before a party that came in and ordered waaay before them and guess what, their sushi came out 15mins before ours. Pls tell me what's wrong with this picture? Probably because I don't have the scooops with the peeps at island sushi. 3) they weren't even busy when we went but service was slow and unacceptable. 4) I have notice their quality in their tuna and it's something I don't recommend.   Overall, unless you know the people at ISG, great! You'll have better service than the people that don't know anyone there but still tries to give them the business they do not deserve. I guess I'll never come back, not even to their grill side. Oh wells....",

The staff is so helpful and accommodating giving off the classic island hospitality.  We can only imagine how chaotic it was for the staff to cater our party, with all the al la carte and all you can eat options, but they did it with ease.  The food was delicious and well prepared and came out in a timely matter.  Our whole team was so impressed with the selection and quality of the food.

The selection is pretty huge but like Poke (I love! So need make stop again just too try it) and dessert only had room for lunch.   It interesting way store set up with one half being sit down restaurant style and other side local style find place sit down eat. Thankfully went late lunch because less then twenty seats.

Like melt in your mouth good! The baked mussel was a bit spicy but still good! Japanese lasagna? GOOD! The servers were super nice and attentive! They kept asking us if we needed anything and would bring us anything we needed. They were also super nice about allowing us share with our 2 year old. Granted we didn't share everything with her, just the dessert, but still it was nice of them to allow us to share. We will definitely be back!!!",

    "text": "Quick stop by this joint today for lunch after a morning full of Garage Sale hopping in Southern Highlands!   Our cousin said this place has bomb custard pie! If you're from Hawaii, you're used to getting bomb custard pie from Zippy's and Foodland or any other average Hawaii grocery store. Here in Vegas, custard pie isn't such a hot commodity, so when Your Cousin says \"custard pie\", you just reply, \"lead the way\"!   We arrived on a Saturday afternoon at around 1pm. The place was semi-packed, we were rushing so we opted for the take-out side of the restaurant. I ordered the kalua pig with poke plate, we shared a custard pie and a side of chicken katsu.   When you walk in, the place is kind of confusing...to the right you'll see a sign in sheet on a table with a sign directing Wait to Be Seated, straight ahead at the end of the take out side of the restaurant you'll see an ordering window with Poke Bowl only menu, and to the left you'll see the take out window with bakery showcase!   I was overwhelmed by all the signage, I just picked a seat and waited for my other half to order us lunch. It took a while to get our order but it was clear that the place was busy. Our food was good, I like that they had shoyu for us on the side next to the soda machine. I also like that they have free refills in the self serve soda machine. I was kind of disappointed that I didn't get to really take a look at the menu so I'll be back again. Next time I'll opt for the dine in side.",

    "text": "I really wanted to love this place. Their rolls are half price on Mondays and Tuesdays, so it would be a great sushi lunch option. Unfortunately, the sushi I experienced was incredibly disappointing.  I ordered an Unagi Roll, a Spider Roll, and their Ahi Fever Roll. I started with the Unagi. It was OK in flavor, but it was very loosely put together to the point of falling apart. It's really not a big deal, but it does detract from the sushi experience. I then moved on to the Spider Roll. This was the roll that made me question this place. It was flavorless and the soft-shell crab was slightly burnt. After making it through that roll, I finally got to the Ahi Fever. Thankfully, this roll was actually pretty good. I'm glad I saved it for last.  My rating for this place would actually be 2.5 stars. I've definitely experienced better, but I would probably return anyway simply because of the prices.",

There were a million rules that reminded me of catholic boarding school in Essex when I was a wee lad. But none of them scared us off. Usual crap: eat all the rolls. Eat the rice. Don't stay for more than 2 hours. One dessert per person.  The food: bomb. Quick. Not overly large rolls. The sushi chefs were nice and helpful. The specialty rolls were creative. Some new pairings I haven't seen before. The nigiri wasn't stingy on the fish. We had hamachi and salmon. Both were tender, fresh, and meaty.  One thing that was awesome about this place is that after 4 full rolls and 4 pieces of nigiri, the people were shocked we were ordering dessert. They wanted us to eat more. That says something about the service. They weren't trying to get us the fock out.   All in all, good place. The ayce for what we eat is probably what we would spend a-la-carte, but whatever.  Just remember, eat your rice. ;)",

    "text": "\"OnoLiscious!\"  Oh my God, when this place first opened it just had the sushi side to it, obviously they are sooo Ono that they opened a fast food side right next to it, with all the Lorcal dishes back home in Hawaii are also offered here, especially the Malasadas....sooo good!  run down:  All you can Eat sushi - So worth it - get the Poki, Lomi Lomi Salmon, garlic chicken , Heck Try all of the pupu side and sushi rolls.   My friend goes there just to eat poki and she orders literally 8 bowls, believe me you'd pay more for just 4 poke bowls normally.  Fast Food side - Bento Boxes are a good deal Saimin is good Malasada's custard filled are Delicious, taste just like Leonards in Hawaii.  Only things that I'm not impressed with is there Eel and Oyakudon bowls, they are soggy and literally when I tried twice to go there and order the Oyakudon (chicken/egg bowl)  they gave me the wrong one and I got stuck with eel.  But to be fair I had a large order both times, so on the 3rd time I just ordered the Oyakudon bowl alone, and I was dissappointed.  I guess I'm used to everything else, which is 98% of the food there 100% onoliscious.  I was hoping their Oyakudon bowl would be like Ichiza's (spring mt), but this dish isn't a staple in Local Hawaiian food, it's more Japanese, so for them just to offer it is remarkable in itself.  Their Guava cake is ono too, but pricey.  Love there breakfast..mmm...mmm...sooo ONO, I'm salivating for my Home food since moving to Denver. :-( can't wait to get back to Vegas.   Oh, forgot to mention the SERVICE is GREAT!  I've been to a lot of all you can eat sushi, actually literally every place in Vegas that has one, and some of the servers get annoyed when we order soo much and they have to keep going back.  I eat like a typical local girl, from a family where we are eating and then talking about what sounds good and what we want to eat later.  lol   Our culture , well atleast my family...We can EAT.  When you get Hawaiians and they have Puerto Rican and all the people who live to eat, you get one Hungry family.   :-)",

Luckily I wanted Sushi and the boy wanted Hawaiian so we drove a little out of our way for this place.  First off, let me say that the staff here, even though it seems young, was extremely friendly.  They all stopped what they were doing when we left and said good bye.  That's huge for me, it shows how much they care and I really appreciate that.    The food?  All good.  We got food to go, I got the spicy mexican roll which was a shrimp tempura roll with spicy hamachi on top and jalapenos.  Then I got hamachi sashimi, which, for 5 slices being only $10, was very well priced.  All the fish was fresh, sauces were balanced, it was beautifully displayed.  The boy got the garlic shrimp combo meal and he was very happy.  I wish this place was closer, I would go more often, but we will definitely have to make a trip back soon!",

So she decided to have her bachelorette in none-other, VEGAS!!!   Our first meal there was at Island Sushi. It was an L&L look alike.  Why we came here, I have no idea.  I can get this at home, really.  The food was not noteworthy.  However, what was disturbing was inside the restaurant.  The place looked so drabbed down I wouldn't want to be found dead here.  The question remains as to whether or not I would come back here again. The answer is probably no because I don't prefer plate lunches.  Environment: When you come here, it resembles so much like Hawai'i.  Didn't you know Las Vegas is the new safe house for former Hawai'i residents, who can't afford to live there?  Once inside, it wasn't too appealing in color.  You see all the metallic refrigerators, kitchen area.  The floors are drab, the walls are dark tinted yellow.  It is certainly meant for a quick and run kind of sit-in place.   Food: I had the Garlic Ahi and all brown rice.  It looked like 3 pieces of 3 oz of grilled ahi, once slice of lemon, and 2 cups of brown rice.  This will fill you up for the price.  The Garlic Ahi was a bit bland.  I would recommend having a garlic sauce to go with it to make it jump from mediocre to awesome. I should have opted out for the mini plate on this one, but because I was starving I didn't care. 3/5  Poke: Although, I didn't have this, the fish didn't look fresh.  It didn't have that shiny, unslimmy, I-Was-Just-Placed-Here kind of look to it.  Yikes! Joe and Phil decided to get it anyway.  Luckily, they chose something that was a little fresher, but the taste was not Hawai'I or my father's level of greatness. 2/5  Cost: My plate came out to be 9.95.  That's cheap, considering the brown rice was an extra $1.25.  Ridiculous.  However, what was uber expensive was the poke. $16.99 a pound!  Jesus Christ!  And if you read the latter information, you would know you were being gypped.   Employees: They were very nice.  The girl at the desk greeted with a smile.  Very courteous, it almost made me forget that the place was a POS.  Parking: This was by far the best feature of this place.  Because it's Vegas, meaning more land space, we had prime real estate, also known as right in front of the doors.",
