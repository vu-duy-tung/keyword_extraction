Atmosphere is great. The employees here are very welcoming, and have a lot of patience. This is the place where you wanna bring friends to catch up on life. I ordered the Chili Cheese dog with the lobster bun. Lobster bun is basically a buttery texas toast and it complimented the hot dog. Good food, good vibes. Would definitely come here again, and maybe spend time here a little longer if I'm not alone.",

Keep in mind three hot dogs shared between two is plenty and you could even get away with two since the hot dogs were above average size.  We weren't huge fans of the patty melt dog, the house was very good, but the best was the teriyaki dog.  Also, get the Mexican corn in a cup as well as the ice cream both were delicious, you won't be disappointed.   The young lady running the counter was not just friendly and helpful but really cared about meal and made several recommendations and accommodations.... not sure if she was the owner but either way she treated us like friends who just walked in off the street.   You should make your way here if you are in town, it's a quick 5-10 car ride from the strip.",

On our way to Cafe Zupas when we came up on Dirt Dog rather quickly, and I had seen this establishment on Yelp and had it bookmarked so when I noticed it on my right, I knew I just had to brake hard and make the right turn into the parking lot. As soon as my friend and I went in we were hit with some Tupac playing through the speakers. My friend was like, yeah this place has some flavor! So the menu is on the wall, with pictures to go with the description which I found very helpful, sometimes it's better to see  than read what you're ordering. My friend got the Dirt Dog, and I had the green dog and we ordered two tacos al pastor. The al pastor although good wasn't the best but this place is called Dirt Dog and we came for the dogs! Both our choices didn't disappoint, they were both delicious. They offer a choice of buns, I recommend the Portuguese bun for .50 cents more.  The staff were friendly and attentive, and multiple times asked how were doing and asked us how we heard about them. Dirt Dog is definitely a place we will frequent, make sure you give this place a visit!",

    "text": "Apart from the reallllllly long wait, I am huge fanatic of  Dirt Dog. It's hip, simple and inventive with selections ranging from vegetarian hotdogs to corn on a cob. I was smitten from my first visit as I choose from different styles of hotdogs. Who knew such a simple entree can be rather complex?   For dinner, I had torn between the brown dog or the green dog which gives me the reason to return in the future. I opted for The Brown Dog which had teriyaki sauce and sesame seed aioli. Can I just have this everyday of the week, please? The hotdog tasted juicy with noting flavors of sweet and salty. The combination between the two really hit it off as it was finished by caramelized onions.   I also had Dirty Corn which consisted of dirty crema, cotija cheese, chili powder, cilantro and bacon bits. For me, it was a 4/5. I think they could've made it just a tad better but this didn't exactly wow me. The corn was perfectly cooked but the ingredients didn't seem to mixed well together. Something was definitely missing there. Perhaps, a flare of heat?   My girlfriend and I also had the Dirty Chili Fries which was not bad! A bit on the salty side but I wouldn't mind getting it again.   As for dessert, we were offered anything we wanted on the menu due to the long wait. So we chose the Horchata Ice Cream. Delicious to say the least, and if I had a choice, I wouldn't share. Sorry, girlfriend!   The long service is what sort of puts me off from visiting again. The food is delicious but when you're ready to grub, there's no way I'm willing to wait as much as we did the first time around.",

They have 8 beer taps, most were craft beer (if that is something you like)Employees are super helpful friendly The place was very clean and the decor is way cool if you enjoyed the West Coast rap, music was perfect for this gal.

Very clean and very open. Loved the layout but it was a tad cold as in not temperature cold but not very inviting...4/5  Service was still off... Maybe I keep on getting them on off times. I entered and looked at the menu boards...I was greeted right away by a lady in the kitchen but the guy that was taking the order was busy doing something... I'm not sure what but there were only 2 tables and they already had their food. I waited a bit and he came and took my order. (3/5) the only reason why I have him a 3 is because he remembered that I asked for extra lime wedges and brought them out.  Food was sadly where they missed it this time. They are known for their hot dog wrapped bacon. Well this time the bacon was chewy and not crisp and no char at all. The lobster roll was toasted almost too dark but sadly the bacon was white since it was mainly fat and limp and just soggy and stringy. The hot dog had no char which added so much for to my dog last time. I got the mutt and the toppings were actually better then last time but the main part... The hot dog wrapped bacon was soooooo sad. :( And I waited almost 15 minutes for this dog. I understand that they are trying for quality over quantity...I get that and respect that... But when I wait 15 minutes and the dog and the bacon is soggy and limp.... The respect goes out the door and I have to wonder what the heck were they doing back there????? (1/5)  The dirty Esquite was the best thing I had today.  It was pretty good but even with all the kernels that get stuck in between my teeth...I stick with the dirty corn... It was good but it had too much crema for my taste it was on the verge of being too creamy. The corn still had great texture which was very glad for. (4/5)  Will I be back.... Maybe... They are very close to me but the hot dog was such a disappointment today. If I do come back it might just be for the corn... Not sure if I want to try the bacon wrapped dogs again with it being so inconsistent. :(",

We placed our order, asked a few questions, and sat down to wait.  After about 5 minutes our server arrived with the best food I've had in a long time. My friend hasn't stopped raving about the esquite and I couldn't get enough of the garlic fries. The dogs were amazing and the beer was cold.  I don't get what someone else was sayin about the price. 2 huge entrees, 2 sides, and 2 beers for $35 is a bargain.   I will definitely be back on my next trip.",

My friend ordered a dirt dog for us to split between both of us and two elotes. The food was amazing!! I loved the bacon bits, special sauce, bread used for their hot dogs, cheese, you name it! Foodgasm at its finest!   The food scene in Chicago is amazing and I really hope a place like this opens up in our city. I visited this place one more time before heading out towards my flight. The cashier was so friendly. Atmosphere there is pretty cool! They play good music, I wanted to get on the table and dance. I won't make a fool out of myself though. But yeah, everyone must try this place out!",

The portions were ample. The service was excellent. Definitely worth a stop by no matter how far you have to drive.",

One beer and one soda   Bad part of the place was they only had one cashier. The line took forever. The front door was right in the middle of the line.  So you had people waiting and people tying to leave.   Overall the food was good. Great beer selection as well   $46 for all of it.",

Walked in about 7:30 in the evening, and this place was packed!!! We had to wait about 15-20 minutes but worth it. I haven't seen hotdogs with the kind of toppings this place has.. definitely check it out if you're into something completely different than the typical hot dog meal. I played it safe and went with the dirty chili dog and it was amazing!! My friends went with the brown dog, and the elote dog and were equally impressed. They also have elotes and tacos available here!! We ordered carne Asada fries and filthy fries and it was so perfectly crispy and seasoned.. and we couldn't leave without the fried Oreos, which had a horchata cream with it. So good! Ambience is casual. Can't wait to come back",

Staff regularly checked to make sure my table wasn't cluttered devoured food baskets and would kindly ask if everything was going well. They even had a wall full of a variety of hot sauces for customers to choose from. The hotdogs and orders of fries we had were top notch and full of delicious flavors. I'll absolutely be coming back as a regular.",

So far I have tried: carne asada tacos, soyrizo tacos, the green dog, carne asada fries, the churro, horchata ice cream, and the deep fried oreos! All were amazing, but my go-to probably has to be the carne asada fries.   The servers are attentive and friendly. They get extremely busy, but still keep the place very clean.

Didn't do the small upgrade for lobster roll but seeing as I didn't enjoy the bun at all this time, I'm definitely going to try for the upgrade next time.  Wanted the Veggie Dog but they were out so opted for the Green Dog.  Went with 2 other friends and we each got a different kind of fries. I got the Dirty Fries and that was the best of the three. Friends got Garlic Fries, and Sea Salt & Pepper fries (quite bland). The seasonings are very light so we didn't really prefer them much. I will be back to try out their Dirty Corn next time as my side.  Gonna get a different Dog each time I come back, but for now, I would recommend the Dirty Fries if you're going to get any fries.",

    "text": "I love hot dogs. It's hard to find a good hot dog place in Vegas. Dirt Dog is a one of those places where they try to gourmet something that's not typically gourmet'ed. They do a fairy good job of it. To be honest I'm old school and prefer my hot dogs with everything Chicago style including tomatoes and celery salt. But you really can't find that here especially since Sammy hot dogs hut closed down. So you get some nasty one like at Nathan's. Or a cheap one like at Costco (get what you pay for), or go gourmet at dirt dog. I'll recommend gourmet out of those choices - weird but good.",

They have a huge map of Vegas on the wall so you can put where you in the valley you came from to eat here. Austin was super friendly and helpful with any questions we had. The tables were cleaned super fast after people left which was nice. We got the brown dog, the party melt dog and the house dog with a side of dirty fries. Overall it was pretty good. I would recommend this place for anyone. They also had street tacos and vegan and vegetarian options which I though was pretty cool.",

    "text": "I saw this place as being a suggestion on Instagram, saw all the great reviews and decided to try it. Walked in today (Sunday) and line wrapped around the bar. I figured since their menu was pretty small it wouldn't take that long to order. We spent 20 minutes in line just to order the food. Then stood for another 10 minutes waiting for an employee to clear and clean the tables so we could have a seat. Seating was very limited and cramped. After another 5 minutes we got our fries and another 5 mins after that we got our hot dogs. The toppings on the hot dogs were original and I've never had anything like them, but it wasn't worth the 40 minute overall wait time. Portuguese rolls were the best part of the hotdog. The employees were friendly but didn't have much pep in their step in terms of cleaning and getting the food out. We had to get napkins to re clean the seats after the employee came and wiped them down. The bathrooms were not clean. As I stated before, the majority of the tables weren't cleaned the entire time we had been waiting in line and we still had to wait for them to be cleaned after we ordered. Just a personal preference: it would have been nice to hear some music other than Tupac, maybe NWA or something else.... change it up a little.",

But I saw an add for this place come across my FB and it had more content  than just your simple Nathan's hot dog. So we came in and I'm glad we did!  The beauty in coming to a new spot with my spouse is we split. So I get to try more without stuffing myself. He ordered their red dog and I tried the green dog. We split the dirty corn, garlic fries and a Twinkie. Although it was so good we almost had to order two twinkles.  The red dog was great. Nice and spicy, covered in bacon and veggies.  The green dog was not spicy but had a zesty and refreshing flavor that calmed the spice from the red dog down.  The garlic fries are plain fries with a delicious garlic dipping sauce so you can control how much anti vampire flavor you want. I will be getting TWO sides of this on my next visit.....it was YUMMY!  The corn was missing the creaminess of the mayo that I'm accustomed to with street corn. That being said it was still very good. It came on a stick so it was easier to handle covered in cheese, bacon and cilantro.  And lastly, when you come in save room for desert! I might have to stop in just for late night fried Twinkie runs....this could be dangerous! They serve it with a light dipping sauce that really complements the Twinkie.  We've already picked out what we will be trying on our next visit!",

Red dog & mutt dog were so spicy we couldn't finish half probably due to the fact it looked like the red pepper shaker broke & opened while making it. Seriously about 4 tablespoons of red pepper flakes on a hot dog. Kind of a let down when they are $6.25 a hot dog. (Keep in mind a in n out burger is $3) Fries were pretty basic \"spicy ketchup\" was ketchup & tobasco. Kids meal was also a let down $7, 5 frozen nuggets & fries with oreos. Service was attentive & knew the menu which is why it got 3 stars. My suggestion include fries with dogs & make meal $7.",

First, service was exceptionally fast given the amount of customers that was there.  We had our food in about five minutes after ordering.  Second, the customer service was awesome!  Chester came to stop by and chat while we were waiting for our food.  Really nice cool dude, made us feel right at home.  As we ate, servers came by and checked in to see if we needed anything, and to remove the finished items from our table. Third, great music playlist!  Hey I'm a girl who loves some great music over food!     Amazing first impression, I will definitely be back!!",

Toppings o plenty that on some level take away from the delicious flavor of the hot dog.  They offer a nice range of draft beers too. A tad pricey for a hot dog though, unless your sprinkling gold flakes on that wiener.  It's worth a trip for sure if you want a loaded dog with fries to chipotle aioli.",

She gave me a quick run down on the menus and was able to make my first visit enjoyable. The food came in less than 5 minutes which is a bonus.   Food:   Flaming dog: dog was juicy and hot (temperature wise). Sadly it was not as spicy as i hoped it to be. But don't be discouraged in trying it, overall was a good dog with a good kick from the habanero sauce.  Recommended on a traditional bun. Caution: the dog can get messy.    Dirty chili dog: from my whole visit this one was my favorite. It reminded me of a sloppy joe. Ordered on a lobster bun (buttered and toasted on both sides). The only down side to this dog was the onions being too thick. But its more of my personal preference. Caution: the dog does have a tendency to go for a slip and slide.   Dirty elote: decided on the most basic corn. This item I would rate 3/5 partly because the elote back home (oxnard) has a special place in my heart.   Dessert: If I were to come back for one thing, it would be the dessert. The horchata ice cream is a must.   Drinks: wide beer selection, sadly was not able to try any this visit. House made horchata and melon fresca. Self service soda fountain as well.   Cons: If you have a big appetite the portions might be a tad bit small. Some tables weren't wiped down and spacing is quite tight.",

My girlfriend got the elote dog and it was good too. There's a reason why they call it dirty dogs, or a danger dog but of course I understand, this is a business and cleanliness and sanitation is very important. I feel almost weird saying all this like I'm not sure if people get me, because real dirty dogs in LA are super unsanitary but man they are so good. Regardless though the point I'm saying is it's no where near an actual dirty dog but regardless it's still super good. I'd go back. I really like the hot Cheetos they put and it had a nice crunch to it compared to this one other spot I go to called Zero Degrees and their hot Cheetos elote fries kind of suck. So this was good. Definitely want to try more.   Also the restroom is very reminiscent of LA with the the mirrors lol",

We ordered one house dog (with bacon thousand island dressing, which was still a little spicy despite removing the green chilie spread) and three patty melt dogs (which comes wrapped in bacon and topped with chipotle aioli, melted cheddar fries and bacon bits). Spring for the sweet lobster roll bread, which costs 50 cents extra -- your tastebuds will thank me later.  We opted not to order fries (although they looked delicious) and went straight to dessert.  Fried oreos (comes with two), a fried twinkie and churro topped off our meal.  All were tasty but the sleeper hit was the churro, which seemed like an excellent value.  Just a couple bites through our meal and we decreed that Dirt Dog would be on the list for future stops in Vegas (or LA).  That type of declaration does not happen so frequently.  So heed these words wisely -- a first visit to Dirt Dog will ruin other future hot dog eateries for the rest of your life.  It's a big risk to take, but one worth taking!",

Once you enter, the register is a few feet away and the wall menu is immediately to your right. You order your food, get a number, and seat yourself wherever you like.   The guy who took our order, Kevin, was amaazzingg! I was not too sure if he was a manager but he needs to be. He went over the menu with me too patiently, and I just had great service the entire time I was there. He even came over to our table a few times to make sure we liked everything.  For the food, I ordered the filthy fries and my friend had the Patty Melt Dog. The fries were so flavorful and the Patty Melt Dog was just woaaaah. Just try it. For the price and the quality, I would say this place gets a 11/10 + 4 thumbs up.  Kevin even talked me into trying one of their house made churros and it was delicious.  I brought my sister on a separate visit and we ordered the elotes with more filthy fries. It was just too good not to order again.  I'm sorry but everything was just too good. Thank you, I'll be back soon :-)",

The dogs are all beef and amazing. The toppings are so delicious. My friend and I ate here for the first time the other night. Line to the door the entire time we were there. It did move quickly though. The music and \"vibe\" of the place is so enjoyable. It felt so much like we were in happening LA. As we were eating, a young man came to our table to ask how everything was. I think he was a busboy. His name was Aaron and he was so sweet. Not your typical young kid. He had a great and friendly personality and genuinely wanted to know that we were enjoying our dinner. Shout out to Aaron!!!! So unusual to find a place with all of these positives. Can't wait to go back!!!! Thank you Dirt Dog!!!!",

You have a choice of buns you can put your hot dog on..from lobster roll (which is $0.50) more or Portuguese roll or regularbhot dog bun.   I ordered the red dogg. Which has chile sauce, peppers and chipotle aioli. It was pretty good. The peppers definitely gave it a good kick of spice. The toppings weren't overwhelming with alot of stuff so you can actually taste the juiciness of the hot dog. Yumm.  My friend ordered the mutt dog which is a mix between the red dogg and green dogg. He said it was pretty good.   I also ordered the filthy fries. Wasn't a huge fan of this one. It has cotija cheese, guacamole, cheese spread and fries. It didn't taste as great as it sounded. Next time I'll stick with regular fries.   Overall it's a good place to try. I would definitely recommend.",

My girlfriend and I both ordered their elote dog, and trying to eat it without spilling some food everywhere will be impossible (hence the first word of the place's name). Although the dog was a little pricey for the size ($7.25), the tasty, warm, and all the bacon bits and corn stuffed in and overflowing the bun kind of made up for it.   On the side we got some garlic fries, which were quite unmatched to any other garlic fries I've ever tried. To top this great experience all off the cashier was a nice dude.  Next thing I wanna try when I come back is their dirty corn.",

Apparently Dirt Dog hails from LA--but I only heard about it after moving out of LA. LOL! It's located in the very corner of a random plaza, so use your GPS like everyone else has said.  Shoutout to the waitress who was doing everything tonight: taking orders, bringing plates out, bussing tables. She was super friendly and gave us a quick run through of the menu. According to her, the house dog and green dog were their most popular dishes. So we got those and the dirty esquite, which is basically elote in a cup. The house dog was so flavorful--the sauce was so bomb. The green dog was also great and a little more tart, but house dog was my favorite. I do wish their dogs would have a crispy bite to them like the ones at Top Dog in Berkeley, CA. The esquite was actually just ok; the cheese was pretty monotonous, so I added some tapatio to change things up.  I took off a star because it's way too pricey for a fancy hot dog. This place is cool and I can see myself coming back when I have a hankering for fancy hot dogs (who knew that could even be a thing lol)",

I forgot to get a drink and had to wait in that awful line a second time. Be sure to order all your food when you get to the front because having to order more items is torture. Also make sure you know what you want when you get to the front of the line, the mob behind you might hang you. They have one cashier and minimal sitting. I don't recommend this place to people. I don't really speak of it or do I crave it when I think about it. it a cute concept, the decor is cute but thats about it. I didn't hate it, I just didn't like it either.",

I was a little lost when I came in but was quickly helped by a very friendly lady who explained me the different buns and what a few of the ingredients were. We ordered 4 dogs, being two wrapped bacon dogs; one house dog; and one elote dog without chili powder, and also garlic fries along with drinks.  The food came out pretty fast and OH MY GOD! I felt like I was in hot dog heaven! :) Everything was perfect and very, very tasty!  We were constantly checked on by one of the ladies which just made the whole experience better.  As for the place itself, it's s really cool place with lots of murals and the colors along with the decoration were very harmonious. The only one thing I didn't like much was the bathroom because it was a little too dark. I saw a baby changing station, which was great, but in a kinda dark place I think it would be a little uncomfortable to change a baby.  Still, it's a must try if you like gourmet hotdogs!",

This hot dog was supposed to be 1/2 green dog and 1/2 red dog. The red dog was so overpowering that I couldn't even tell it was a mixture, it felt like I only got the red dog. It was so spicy I couldn't even eat it. It  was so spicy I drank my water and also my boyfriend's water.   Chili cheese dog: it was good. Mostly just tasted like a standard chili cheese dog. The lobster roll on this one is was way better. I wasn't amazed by it.  Elote fries: pretty good, I liked the mixture.   The staff was pretty friendly and patient, which is always a plus.",

The vibe is really cool too, I loved the music they were playing and the artwork on the walls. This is a place that you absolutely have to visit especially if you're new to Vegas!",

I have eaten here 4 times and have not ordered the same thing twice and can easily give this place five stars. The line moves quickly the staff is friendly and the food is served promptly. You can adjust your order to your taste however I recommend trusting the Chef & Order directly from the menu the dogs are insanely good. The french fries are outstanding. This is not a location where you will go to stay on some sort of diet or eating plan. This is a place where you get an amazingly delicious fresh hot dog made like no other hot dog you've ever eaten. Recommended this too many friends and all have said the same thing this place is amazing!",

I liked their lobster roll- style bun as it helps keep it light and not overly burdened with bread, focusing your attention and appreciation on the toppings and the dog itself. I think my favorite thing between the fries, dog and elote corn-in-cup was the corn! But all in all a creative place to get your hot dog & beer fix.",

The only thing I didn't like was the price. I think they should raise the price of the dogs by $2.00 and give French fries.

There was 1 cashier and about 12 people in line and they were so backed up on orders...we waited 25min for our order after 20min in line. Maybe just a bad night?? We wanted a cold beer while we waited for our food but they were out of every beer on tap except for 2, Really? The entrance/exit to this place is crowded by all the people in line...odd placement.  The chili cheese fries were just a handful of lukewarm fries and a spoonful of chill and cheese on top. 4 fries off the top of the box later and my boyfriend just had to eat them plain. The cheese sauce had a powdery texture and just dried up in 5 minutes...kind of odd but that's processed food for you.  The elote cup was good and I thought the Churro was yummy until I got to the middle and tasted batter! It was totally raw.  I'm not sure why all the rest of the food just tasted kinda STALE.  Not all it's hyped up to be that's for sure.",

Delicious! Alex was amazing and brought food out as it became ready, which was great for us since we had the kids with us....they were busy on chowing on dirty corn while we waited for our dogs. I was able to sample a few beers to pick the one I liked most, which made it easier for me to enjoy. Alex was super friendly and made the atmosphere light.

Although it caters that theme by playing music that has roots in LA and incorporating art that can be found in the City of Angels, the dog does not hit the note of a True inner city street dog. Granted, the actual hot dog tasted fine (my dog was cold, my wife's was not) and the fries were spectacular, I would say I could come back to try some more.",

It's very tucked in this plaza & you'll probably miss it if you're not paying attention.   Anyway, I've been here a couple of times & I've ordered the same thing lol. They apparently have a secret menu & obviously it's not written anywhere in the establishment. I usually order the mutt dog & I believe that's a mixture of the green & red dog, but I'm not completely sure. The flavor is amazingggg though. It has a little kick. Throw it in a lobster bun & order some dirty fries & im pretty sure that's what heaven tastes like. I was really excited about having elotes near my house, but unfortunately I didn't like theirs. When I got mine, it was burnt... & I waited over 15 mins for it. I guess I'll have to keep making them at home for now.",

    "text": "I don't really miss Los Angeles, so trying this place was pretty low on my priorities. But I finally did and I'm happy with the experience here. It's pretty amusing to see an LA-themed restaurant here in Las Vegas. But I did love the 90s Rap/Hip Hop that's constantly playing. On a side note, there seems to be a Tupac Amaru Shakur tribute vibe here as well (as there should be!) I loved the ambience. They also have those angel wings painted on a wall of which girls love to pose in front of and post on instagram for the 999999th time. But hey, it's free hashtag advertising for this place, right? And they have some board games that you can play at your table while you are visiting.  You have a wide variety of choices and options here. You can get any dog with a choice of your normal bun, Texas toast, lobster bun, or Portuguese bun. I've never tried the Portuguese bun, so I got the Ranchero Dog with the Portuguese today. They also have a lot of other street food type items here as well such as nachos and tacos. And their desserts look fabulous. I didn't try any desserts this time because I could feel my love handles growing just by reading the dessert menu. The dogs themselves are not huge. They are normal length so they won't stuff you. In fact, if you have one of those big \"American\" appetites, one dog may not satisfy you.  I also had their garlic fries. Very good but a tad oily especially the fries on the bottom of the box.  My only gripe about this visit was that my fries took a while to come out. My dog came out and I finished eating it long before the fries came out. No biggie. I was in no rush. The staff was very cool and friendly so it was fine.  I'm looking forward to coming here again and trying more items. I only had this place a handful of times back in Los Angeles, so I'll try everything else here.",

Nine times out of ten it's for lunch. Nine times out of ten we say we are going to go to \"restaurant a\" and wind up going to \"restaurant b\" or \"restaurant c\". Always changing our minds.  BUT... thanks to YELP, I came across Dirt Dog, and we went straight there, no stopping. We says pictures of this place and had our minds made up. Turns out Dirt Dog's location is at a former hamburger joint that I just loved.  About 15 minutes after Dirt Dog opened for the day; we went inside and were immediately greeted. By a young lady in a halter top. If not for the fact that she was behind the counter, I would have thought her to be another customer. She was however very informative about the menu. Here's what we ordered.  Fran: The Green Dog: Chimichurri Sauce, Guacamole Spread with Garlic Fries  Porter: The Red Dog: Spicy Tomato Chile Sauce, Chipotle Sauce with Dirty Fires  The food is awesome people. The cost, just under twenty-five dollars!  Fountain drinks for beverages. Sodas, tea that sort. There is also a bar area.  The decor to Dirt Dog is pretty cool but seems unfinished. One wall has a floor to ceiling map of southwest Las Vegas. The other side of the room was a blank wall. Walking towards the restroom is an empty room. This appears to be a waiting room of sorts. A window for take-out at one end, door to the world on the other. A very large sticker of sorts is on a wall in this room. The sticker is of the Dirt Dog logo. But a good portion has come free of the wall.   So here's the plus side:  The Food  So here's what I consider to be a negatives: No staff uniforms, not even name tags Incomplete decorations on the walls.  If you find yourself in Southwest Las Vegas, venture down to Dirt Dog, the food alone is worth the effort and time.",

First impression the atmosphere is awesome we thought the long line for food would make the wait forever but it moves very fast. We waited about five minutes total to order food which was great. The music was awesome all the employees were very friendly and the cook time for food took about five minutes for all four of my groups large order! It all looked very good almost identical to the menus pictures. The cheesy corn left a lot to be desired and the garlic fries were a little overpowered with spices and garlic. The hot dog which is what I came for was very good. All in all I had a pleasant experience but the food did not live up to the hype. I can see this as a once in a blue moon place to grab food but nothing more than that.",

    "text": "Dirt Dog is fun, funky and delicious. The service was great and the food was definitely worth going back for. We were a group of 5. We ordered two kids meals, one chicken nuggets and one with corn dogs and the portions were quite generous, they loaded it with fries so my girls were happy. My son went for the patty melt hotdog and it was amazing, I had to sneak a bite because he was not interested in sharing. I ordered the carne asada fries and they did not disappoint, it was a good serving of fries and a large portion of carne asada and toppings. My husband ordered their elote esquite which is corn in a cup with bacon and he ordered the original dog, he also was not interested in sharing because it was so good but he is obligated to share so I can confirm it was as tasty as he claimed.   The only drawback - the restaurant is small and the place is popular so for a larger group like ours, we had a problem finding a place to sit and eat together. So as much as I would like to go again I need to find a better time when it is not as busy so we can eat without feeling rushed.",

I'm so glad we did, not only was I not disappointed but they exceeded my expectations! I was greeted with a smile order was placed and within 5 minutes of sitting I got my entire order! The hype is for sure real food looked exactly like the pictures and it was amazing! Someone came over asked how we were doing and said let him know if we need anything so polite very great customer service this is now a favorite spot to go to I'm a Vegas local however I live on the other side of town but it's totally worth the drive definitely!! I look forward to going again we even had to order 3 more of the flaming elote to go it's so delicious I advise to try this place out!",

    "text": "Had Dirt Dog first time last night. Ordered 4 dog (two green, one plain-with relish, and 1 cheese), 2 corn and dirty fries). Total was $55. It was tasty and I did enjoy it but the price is outrageous when you really think about what you've purchased - that is a cost of about a week's worth of groceries for a lot of people. For the price, it's not worth it at all, and it would not be something I frequent. I love hot dogs, I make them all the time, and I use Sucker Punch spicy pickles (I dice them into a relish), and it's my favorite fast food at home. With that said, I'm a bit picky with how I like them. I get the hype over this place but I do feel you're better off buying kosher or organic dogs and doing them at home.   Flavors are good and fun to have them every now and then, but again, it's just way too expensive for some wieners. I am happy, though, for the owners and their success.",

The BF and I wanted something low key for dinner so we made the trek down.  We almost didn't walk in because of the line to the door and it looked like no tables were available. I'm happy to say we stayed and I'm sooooooo glad we did! Variety of dogs and fries, even tacos, and corn! He had the dirty chili dog, I had the House dog and we each shared garlic and elote fries. Hands down best French fries I have ever had! Usually when you order garlic fries, midway through eating them, they turn soggy but not these ones! Seriously the best French fries I've ever eaten!  I was a tad confused by my house dog thinking it would have thousand island dressing, green chili sauce and the standard toppings. I did not expect the ketchup and mustard on it but regardless, it was delicious!  There are so many choices and all look spectacular so we'll definitely be back!",

I'm not sure how this company started, but I get the feeling they used to be a food truck.  Like one of those good food trucks that has a constant line.  Food was a little more expensive than I would normally pay for hot dogs and fries, but it was extremely worth the extra couple bucks.  If you like spicy, they've got plenty of menu options for you.  My wife doesn't do spicy, and she still found something she loved.  We watched the second half of a soccer match just sitting there talking.  Good atmosphere to hang out.  They also have a pretty good beer selection if you're into that.  Overall, recommend!",

I don't even know how to describe the taste other than amazing, you will not regret this one! The others we tried like the DUI fries, elote dog, and green dog were ehhh. The elote fries and flaming dog were an amazing duo. Highly recommend this place",

However as for dirty chilly or pastrami or cheese then this place rocks.  However they should consider the traditional.   Sometimes simple is best.    Fries were excellent.  Twice fried or at least they tasted like that.   Street corn was very good.   However, the biggest disappointment was the pastor taco.  It has ground beef.  WTF.  It's like they came up with an idea for left over chilly meat.   It almost took them down to 3 stars but the rest of the food was excellent and I really had to remember this was a hot dog place.   Or at last a dog without kraut place.",

    "text": "It took me a while to figure out if I like this place or not. I always got excited when I knew we were coming to eat here but some visits were a hit and other were just meh. You really need to try the menu and find out what you like and stick to those items. I've tried most of their hot dogs, tacos, corn and their dessert.  Hot dogs- they are hot or miss depending on what you like on your hot dog. Since this place is LA inspired I was hoping they would have the basic L.A street dog that I love so much. Dirt dog had one similar but it's not the same. I do notice that they put a lot of stuff on their dog and I appreciate it but sometimes all those flavors can be over powering or difficult to eat off a dog. I had the flaming dog which had hot Cheetos crumbs all over. It tasted good but the Cheetos kept falling off when I went for the bite some most of the Cheetos fell on the floor or fell in the basket but the dog is really good. I did find my favorite dog which is the dirty dog and I couldn't be happier.  Fries-I advice everyone to try the fries at this place. The carne asada fries are so good but the fries here are just so good on their own. Great texture, flavor and crisp.  Tacos- This place is not a taco shop, their tacos are ....... meh, not sure what it might be but they are not my favorite. If you are in the area and are wanting tacos I recommend these instead of going to Alberto's. Like I said , this isn't a taco shop, but I think they can make the tacos taste better to bring more people in ( not that they have issues with that, this place is always busy). I'll give their tacos a few more tries just to see what it is about them that isn't selling me or who know I might become a fan. Dessert- The desserts here are pretty good, I enjoy their churros. They also serve the churros with a cinnamon sugar cream which give it a nice taste.  Corn- their elote is good, personally I don't normally get it because they add a weird seasoning. Don't get me wrong I like the spice but here they serve it with a Cajun, cumin like seasoning and I'm not loving it. I like the traditional seasoning that the corn-man uses , you know the guy with the shopping cart. It's my preference others might really like the seasoning here but personally it's not my favorite. Drinks- They serve ALCOHOL!!! Sold! They also have agua frescas, my go to is the jamaica/hibiscus drink which is my favorite. I'll sometimes order it with milk just to just the tartness, give it a try, you might really enjoy it. Not sure if they ever serve hochata here, I think they should more often if they do, I swear my husband will be here all the time.  Locations it pretty nice, next to a few restaurants and nice neighborhood. Interior is very L.A, they love their Tupac R.I.P. Every time I'm here is reminds me of being back home in Orange County hanging out in DTSA so I love the vibe here. Great place to bring friends. The restaurant is a decent size, finding seating doesn't seems to be a problem. After eating here several times I can honestly say I'm a fan. They have good stuff, not everything is great, a few things can be hit or miss but it's definitely a place where I feel you might find your holy grail.",

What I ordered :  Patty melt dog on a lobster roll  Dirty esquite  Churro with the horchata whipped cream  1. Patty melt was not how it usually tastes. The chipotle aioli was incredibly spicy and overpowering the whole hotdog. There was barely any cheese... how does one make a melt with no cheese? I've ordered this so many times and I'm so sad it didn't taste as good as it usually does  2. The bacon bits of disappointment and sadness. Who enjoys BURNT bacon bits? Not me.   3. The dirty esquite was okay and the churro with the whipped cream is still pretty damn good",

There is no real simple hot dog here (I assume they would do it if you asked).  Rather they are savory and spicy combinations of different things.  The bun was soft but sturdy.  The dining room is not small but not big either and filled up fast while I was there.  Food came out quickly and service was friendly.  This place is a ways off the strip if you are just visiting but worth the trip.",

    "text": "It is not centrally located, so more than likely if you're a tourist or a local, you will have a trek. It is located in a non-descript strip mall, tucked away in the back.  Near a Vietnamese take out and across from a dog resort. (Yes, you read that right. And no, the irony is not lost on me). There is not much parking. But there is an adjacent dirt lot (yes, I see that one, too), that some make use of.  But yes, this is worth the effort. Cute and worthwhile concept of gourmet hot dogs, including creations with Argentinian chimichurri or Mexican guacamole. Fries with carne asada or chili. And other concoctions, too.  Mexican corn with cheese. Prices for hot dogs are over $6. Fries run between $3-7. We spent approximately $40 for two of us.  I DIG the carne asada fries! They come with cilantro, creme, avocado, and some spicy sauce. Tasted a little more like green chili than carne asada but it was much appreciated and served with lime. Use it! Adds a delicious tangy refreshment to the fried dish.  I found the \"Mutt Dog\" too spicy. It is a blend of their \"Red Dog\" (really spicy) and \"Green Dog\" (purportedly not spicy). But it tends toward more of the Red Dog, so I was reaching for my Hibiscus (called \"Jamaica\", pronounced \"HI-Myka\") drink to cool down. Try it. Also, they have the real sugar \"Mexican\" Coca-Colas, which are subtly different from the regular American cokes which are made with high fructose corn syrup. (If you have a refined palate, yes, you will taste the difference, and the Mexican one is better).  The horchata ice cream and churro is a nice finish, especially if you ordered a spicy dog. It is a little thick, but big enough to share. My only criticism of this is it should have had more of the nuts and rice Krispy toppings, and maybe a bigger or more churros. The ratio was a little bit off.  Service is terrific. Friendly order person and server. Yes! Felt like I was in a real service town, like LA or New York. You order and pay at the cashier (order person), but have the food brought out to you, and cleared by a hard-working, friendly server. ANISHA, you rock! Great smile and super attentive service!  Speaking of which, the venue is trendy, with photos and murals of Los Angeles (\"City of\", with colorful angel wings). A map of Clark County displays yellow tags to show how far you came to \"get dirty.\" Ask to post where YOU came from in the city to this little out of the way place. The music is 90s Hip-Hop. Surprised to see how family friendly this place is! Despite how trendy (and surreal portraits of Tupac, Ice Cube, and Kobe Bryant, for example), whole families come in, with little kids in tow.",

A family left and disintegrated bus their table, so the nice staff did for us. No problem.  We got our food. Dirty chili was great and spicy. Garlic fires were subtle and hot.  The corn dogs were awesome and it came with cookies.  My youngest devoured the fries.   Great service...the cleaners came over twice to check on us.   Will come back. Oh and catchy music in the back. All sorts of people here and all welcome.",

Definitely a crowded place so you have to find a table quick!   They have so many different options, who knew you could make a hotdog so many different ways. I got the elote dog, best thing ever. A little messy so don't wear your favorite clothes that day. Also got the garlic fries, fresh garlic on the top, so excellent.    The staff was all super friendly, and I was happy to see they had Stella cidre on tap! Definitely will be back for more!",

    "text": "Spending 6 hours at a bar you don't really want to order food from watching football is one way to work up an appetite, and that's exactly what I did last Sunday. Being in the state of borderline hangry status, I was very excited to finally try a dog at Dirt Dog.   Like a True Yelper, I was figuring out what I was going to order before I even arrived. Green dog...red dog...-errr...should I go with the Mutt? I even showed the menu to my peers to help me decide, because let's keep it real, no one should be ordering the same thing.   When I walked in, I FREAKED OUT when I saw there was a whole other menu (or 2) aside from what is listed online. \"There's an even dirtier dog?! And Tacos?! And dessert?!\" I found myself experiencing drive-through anxiety and ended up with the Elote dog on a lobster roll, with chili fries...and carne asada fries---- I dunno, it all happened so fast.   Long story, short, delicious dogs and fries. Definitely hit the spot. Their dogs are Nathan's all-beef (and bacon-wrapped), so...yum. The only reason why I'm not giving it a 5 is because Dog Haus exisits...and I'm a True sucker for Dog Haus (1. they make their own dogs, 2. they have smaller portions available one can sample everything, 3. well, I'll save this for another review).",

    "text": "We were very excited to finally try Dirt Dog. We stopped by the one on the Vegas strip but didn't like how you had to order on the go no where to sit and their menu is actually smaller selection. Anyway to start I ordered the Elote Dog, my wife was unsure what to order so she chose the House Dog. The cashier was nice, he removed the bacon for her by request since she can't have pork. We realized each hot dog was wrapped in bacon right before we ordered. We were appreciative they also have a Veggie dog but its soy based and not vegan. We also ordered an order of Dirty Fries which comes with some spicy ketchup. We'd like to have an extra cup of that ketchup because it definitely not enough lol. The hot dogs were delicious, wish I had ordered 2. Trust me don't try and be polite, the toppings will definitely get messy on the table, if you look around you'll notice this happens with everyone lol. My only suggestion if ever in the future think about adding turkey hot dogs as another alternative, that would be great! The only reason I gave a raiting of 4 instead of 5 is I don't like entry way. Once you come in there's 1 foot between the entry to the rope cords for the line which makes it kind of tight. Also I like how the bathroom has a LA feel with gravity and stickers but it also had a poor smell of urine like customers wanted to bring that feel a little bit too real into reality. Overall we'll definitely be back and I'm glad this one is away from the strip and not too far from our home.",

    "text": "Finallly! After weeks of me talking about how I wanted to try this place out and watching multiple foodies rave about this place. My BF and I made it to Dirt Dog.  I haven't been eating meat much and today was the day to indulge a little bit.   As we entered we were greeted by a girl at the counter, she was friendly and told us to order when we were ready. We stood there for a moment (since it was our first time) and checked out the menu. No one in line but us. My BF mentioned that it was our first time and asked suggestions and that's when the girl at the counter went over how it all works, gave us customer favorites, her favorites and was able to answer all our questions.   After drooling over their menu on the wall for several minutes, we finally made our decisions. I got the #DirtyChiliDog topped with their house made chili and melted bacon cheddar. My BF got the #PattyMelt topped with the melted cheddar fries and Chipotle Aioli Spread. Oh, and let's not forget the #DirtyChiliFries which is also topped with their house made chili.  We didn't wait long until our food came out. Everything looked so yummy as the food came to our table. Definitely an Instagram worthy type of lookin' food!?!@?  Overall, customer service was great! The restaurant was clean, love the decor and the music. Now, the food...It wasn't bad, nothing too special, I guess with all the hype, I was expecting more. My BF and I felt that the food was a little too salty for us which I think is the main reason why we didn't LOVE IT like we had thought we would.   Maybe we'll give it another go, there were some other items I'd like to try.",

I still have yet to try any desserts as they run out of the ones I ask for.   Was craving mexican corn one day and found out that this place had something similar. The service was good and the place is really nice inside. Haven't dined in yet, but I liked how they have their menu on the wall when you walk in.   For gourmet got dogs the prices were fair. I got the house dog and the corn. The corn was a bit on the salty side for my taste. The hot dog was pretty good though.   Next time I would like to try their desserts since they looked yummy!",

Unlike other restaurant, the vegetarian options mirrors those from the regular menu (you have different options for hot dog toppings).  This cafe style restaurant is based off of Los Angeles' street food. In addition to hot dogs, they serve fries and tacos and fried Oreos or Twinkies. There's also alcoholic options as well. It was packed on a Sunday night (for good reason) and there were literally no available seats upon ordering. Once a seat opened up, the employee was prompt and rushed over to clean the table.   Everyone that we interacted with, whether it was the cashier or server who brought the food, was positive and everyone was super friendly. I love the overall vibe of the restaurant.   The vegetarian hot dog was so good! Honestly, it tastes so much like meat. I already can't wait to come back.",

The atmosphere is something you'd expect in an urban center with friendly staff, ketchup and mustard dropped paint on the floor.    The staff is unbelievable. Kudos to a fun atmosphere, great food great dogs.   Definitely do the carne asada and filthy fries.",

You basically are walking straight into people in line. This whole setup seems like a fire code violation. Personally I feel like I can go to Costco get a better hot dog and drink for $1.75. We eat all over Vegas and working in F&B for over a decade this just was very underwhelming for me. 2 people $30 is insane! It's a hotdog lol! You are charging dodger dog prices..",

With a great hip hop ambiance and music selection. Today I had the patty melt dog. So good  big fan of chipotle aioli. Last time was the pastrami dog and my 1st time I had the Dirty chili cheese dog. All are delicious and do overs. I also got the lobster roll my first time, but I don't know that it needs it when it's packed with so much flavor in every bite. Definitely have to try the fries as well.",

My wife and I were thinking pizza or wings, I literally just looked out the car window and saw the sign. Best decision I ever made. This place reminds me of home and growing up in East Los. Elotes! Elote dogs! Elote fries! Elote cups! I died and went to heaven. Plus they serve beer and horchata. If you an LA native, come here, the food will not disappoint. Amazing service, good amount of seating, good selection of dog friendly beers, lots of tasty choices plus they serve street tacos. I'm drooling",

Super rich and full of flavor! The garlic fries seemed to have actual fried garlic on them which you normally dont see. And the patty melt dog was something diffrent in a tasty way!

    "text": "I was in Vegas last week and I was really excited to try this place. What caught my attention about this place is that it had really good reviews. The pictures of the food looked so delicious. I finally got to try it. My boyfriend and I ordered the elote dog and chili fries. Everything tasted excellent! The hot dog was nice and juicy. The portion is huge. I'd highly recommend everyone to check this place out if you're in Vegas. My boyfriend and I truly enjoyed this place!   However, the only thing that's keeping me from giving this place a 5 star, is that we found hair in our chili fries. I'm not the type of person to make a big deal about hair in my food. I would usually just pick it out and not eat the part of my food that the hair touched. But this time it wasn't just one strand of hair. It was two or three long strands. It was mixed in with the chili.. I just couldn't. To be honest, I lost my appetite. I didn't even bother trying to pull it out because I was just kind of disgusted actually.. we brought it back to the workers and they gave us a full refund of the meal. Which was really nice of them to do and I really appreciated that. While we were standing there waiting for the worker to do what they needed to, my boyfriend overheard a manager (I'd assume she was a manager) talking to the cashier lady that she needed to talk to her about \"this.\" So this made us wonder if the hair issue happens often here. I'd suggest for the management of this place to make the workers wear a hairnet in order to prevent this issue from occurring again.",

We got four hotdogs, two corns, elote fries, two tacos and four drinks (2 fountain, 2 Mexican cokes).  After eating decided on getting the horchata ice cream (very good)!  The hotdogs were pretty good.  Two of us got the lobster bun (50 cents extra) and the other two normal buns.  As for the corn, never as good as the elote man but still yummy. I got the dirty corn and my daughter wanted the hot Cheeto version with nothing on top.  The elote fries were interesting and good.  Moving on to why I only gave it a four star... the two tacos had a hair in it.  The waitress brought the manager over and they kindly refunded the two tacos on the card and made us two more. Other than that mishap... all and all was a nice restaurant and friendly staff and great food.",

    "text": "Awesome, awesome dogs; way, way understaffed.  Tried the veggie, mutt, house, and red dogs. Overall, the dog itself is flavorful, meaty, juicy, and it's got that great bite that makes hot dogs so great. And the dog is wrapped in bacon, but it doesn't interfere with the bite at all; just makes a crunchy, juicy, fatty wiener. Absolutely delicious.  They're stuffed with toppings, but not overfilled. Get the lobster bun; really buttery and soft to go with the hot, savory dog within. The toppings are reminiscent of the Chiptole fajita mix, with that grilled, mild Mexican flair.  RED DOG: This thing packs a very spicy punch. You can see the red pepper flakes lining every inch; really spicy but not excessively tongue-burning. I thought it was just right. There's a nice dressing/sauce underneath the wiener that brings the whole scrumptious thing together.  MUTT DOG: Tons of stuff going on here. Gotta get the lobster bun to sop up all the sauce coming underneath. It's got the heat of the red dog, with more spicy tomato sauce from the green dog part. The guac paired very nicely with the heat.  HOUSE DOG: Meh, what you'd expect from a hot dog with all of those toppings. Nothing crazy, not particularly memorable. Stick with the red/green/mutt.  The garlic fries were the bomb. Garlic for days. Their fries are really crispy and salty, but the garlic sauce just takes it to another level. A must-try.  The dirty corn is also great. If you're into carnival/fair style corn on the cob, make sure to get one of these.   This is a genuine competitor for Vegas' best dog with Windy City and Bulgogi's. Vegas hot dog lovers, meat lovers, food lovers alike: put Dirt Dog next on your foodie bucket list.",

    "text": "Been wanting to come here for a while now. So my boyfriend and our friend decide to stop in.  Me and my bf got the patty melt on a lobster roll.  We also got the elote fries, the elote and the fried oreos.  We got our number and maybe about 5 minutes later our dirty dogs came out . Great presentation , looked awesome. The nice lady said the rest will be out right now. So we took a bite and the first thing off the bat the food was cold. The cheese tasted as if it was sitting in the fridge that's how cold it seemed . The taste was great I just didn't care how cold it was for it to made fresh. So a few minutes go by and no eltoe fries or elote. It's been about 10  minutes since our dogs came out then my elote fries come, then we wait about 5 more minutes and the corn comes out. Not to crazy about the corn , tasted like it was chargrilleed so we had a few bites and that was it. Elote fries were a tad to salty but overall good.  Our friends daughter got the kids menu chicken nuggets. Shes only 4 so she takes a bite and she got corn dogs instead which she doesn't like but we weren't about to wait another 15 minutes for it. Few minutes later the employee comes back and says oops I gave you corn dogs by accident instead.  Will I be back ?maybe if I was in the area.  Overall dirty dogs were good but If you want them cold and one item brought out at a time . By all means go ahead.",

Most importantly, the food was BOMB. Everything looked just as pictured online and on the menu; the tastes were just as vibrant. I had the Elote Dog, and the Dirty Esquite... delicious.

This place is about the dog, but more than that, they're about the toppings and the bun.  TIPS:  1. Be prepared to wait a bit. Not because the place is ever slammed with customers, but because the quality of food they provide just takes a bit to finish. 2. GET THE LOBSTER ROLL. I personally think this should be the only bread option they offer because it's so much better than a regular bun. 3. Chips/Fries - these are just OK in my opinion, however, if you like seasoned fries/chips, they may be up your alley. 4. One hotdog is enough, unless you're a really big, super starving dude. I'd recommended bringing a friend, ordering two different dogs and splitting them. It's amazing how different they taste.  Favorite item - the green dog.",

Veggie dog was served to me barely cooked. Sent it back for new one.  Garlic fries were just fries with uncooked dry/hard bits of garlic from a shaker.   Only item on point was their dirty corn.

Best of all, a few good beers on tap to go with those spicy sauces and some bomb ass 90's hip hop, heavy on the 2Pac.  Never been a huge hot dog fan, but Dirty Dog has made me a believer.

Corn was delicious though! We went last night, Sunday around 7:30ish & it was a long wait to order. There was only 1 girl taking orders & she was going back & forth with the iPads taking different orders for customers. Our table was never cleaned, so we picked up after the last customer & grabbed a few napkins to get rid of the crumbs & stuff. Bummer. We drove about 30 mins to try this place out, so I'm not sure about a second time. 4 stars because we didn't horribly dislike the food. It was still very filling.",

The garlic fries are good! I had a brown dog and found sauce to be rather salty. I had the dirty corn which was very tender.  The decor is clean and sparse, and they serve beers and sodas. My husband had the deep fried oreo and enjoyed that. I was not overwhelmed but it is a fun place if you are a hot dog aficionado. I love that the space is such that no one is sitting too close to anyone else!!",

What really sold me were all the other deliciously \"dirty\" options.  The Veggie Dog ( green style w/ Portuguese bun) For lack of a better word.... it.. sucked. The chimichuri was not chimichuri it was something that made the bun a light green color and kept it super dry. I didn't mind the veggie dog itself, nice grill marks, but zero flavor. Just a soy tube. A little fat, salt/pepper can go a long way.   * They offer 3 types of buns (which are all egg washed so NO VEGAN option) a regular white, a Portuguese (which was described as sweet but really should just be described as SUCKS)  I did want to add that the cook noticed that I wasn't really into my meal and offered to make me something new but by that time I was already full. I will absolutely give this place another shot... even if its just for their delicious mexican corn",

The staff is super friendly and gives good recommendations. The prices are decent and reasonable, although I haven't been to a lot of specialty hot dog restaurants so I'm not sure how competitive they are.   I had the green dog and corn as my side. My foot came out about ten minutes after I ordered it, but our service mixed my side up with my fiances. On top of that, my fiances fries came out cold. Not lukewarm, but cold.   I might return, but it's not really a place I see myself frequenting. It is worth going once, though.",

    "text": "First the staff is nice... Well I should say the cook/chef in the back was very cool.   The bun was great and the hotdog was great . For 5.95??? Not that good. Now- if it came with fries and drink for say... $9.99 then fine. Still pricey but totally doable. Also didn't see any options for a plain dog w/just mustard or catsup..They should have that.  I don't drink beer. But if I did, $8 for a beer is higher then at Dodger stadium. Would love to see there sales for beer. I would bet a lot of money is not so good. With this location and in this town... Very few are going to pay. $8 for a beer.   Also love it's open until 11pm... But have a \"happy hour\" say 9pm to 11:00pm... Half off... You would kill it ....  The fried Oreo cookie . Is good. I mean Oreo cookies are one of the best things ever created... So it is almost impossible to mess up an Oreo...But only giving 2... Not so good. Dipping sauce is great. But I LOVE OREO and would never get this desert again.  Who doesn't like a churro? Would have been A LOT BETTER if it was twice the size and 1/10 the cinnamon sugar.  Overall the space is way to big and just doesn't fit the hot dog vibe. Also I love Tupac ... But completely out of place and threw the vibe off.  I hope he has free rent as the burger place that was there before had to move as it's the single worst location on Rainbow.  Another terrible thing......When u pay with debit or credit they turn the pad towards you (cool)  and first you must decide what % of tip to leave...5,10,15 or 20%. (NOT COOL) This is BEFORE YOU EVER GET FOOD OR SERVICE!!   Also they would like you just to leave your mess at the table and there are no garbage cans. Ok that's fine... But how about a sign telling me that?  This place could be AWESOME. But it's not and it will have to close and move to another location or make major changes...",

It's LA style with good old school hip hop playing as you eat. Variety of items to choose from, even street tacos. Churros aren't worth the price, very small, like two drops of dog poo. Sorry to sound mean bit disappointed in the size. Lol swap meet has better price and size. A craving is a craving though. The menu is full of every combo you can want to try. The elote dog was delicious.  Overall great experience. Next time I'll have to get their drinks.",

The team behind concocting these flavors are brilliant period. I would put money behind this awesome place.",

When we got our chili dogs they were good but i did not like the cheddar cheese sauce. It had a powdery texture and didn't look like real cheese. Real cheese shouldn't be powdery. Right? Carne asada fries were good but it could have used more guac and sour cream. There was only a little bit on the fries. The churros were way too small for the price. They were super skinny. Overall, if you want a hot dog and a delicious churro go to Costco. Not only is it delicious but you get it all including a drink for less than $5. Carne asada fries go to Robertos. I just feel that for the price they charge you don't get your money's worth.   I would say come here for the experience and try it out. Will i be rushing to go back? No. I wanted to see what all the hype was about but i wasn't that impressed.",

We ordered two  Dirty Chili Hotdogs. They both came with a few pieces of shredded cheddar cheese. ( literally only a few pieces). When I asked the cashier girl, why there is no melted cheese on the top, she said it doesn't come with melted cheese. Weird! If you check the menu it says clearly \"Melted Bacon Cheddar\". And after that I checked their website and the photos obviously show that they use melted cheese on this item. I don't know why they didn't use on ours. They were lazy maybe?  Top photo is my hotdog.

I just like hot dogs so that's why I wanted to check it out. I was pleasantly surprised to see it was a Mexican spot, I really like the idea of it. Mexican LA street food and hot dogs together is a cool combo.   I got the hot Cheeto dog with the lobster roll bun,my bf got the pastrami dog with the Portuguese bun, and we shared an order of the chili fries.   It was all very nicely done, the hot dog was perfectly cooked and juicy, the bacon wrapped around it was crispy but not overbearing, and the toppings were plentiful and flavorful. The fries were crispy, and the cheese sauce on them was bomb.   Would definitely come back again. It was busy when I visited and I can see why!",

I was traveling to Vegas with my boyfriend and we were craving something that was quick and fast but also cheap. We were on yelp looking for some food that was around us and we came across Dirt Dog. I ordered the pastrami dog (Left) and my boyfriend ordered the red dog, they were both so well-made with great ingredients. Everything was made perfectly and I especially like the banana peppers you get on the side. We also got garlic fries to add onto our meal and they were also well seasoned with a good amount of garlic and a good crunch. I'm so glad I have one of these restaurants back home but I'm glad I got to try it out for the first time at their Vegas location. The atmosphere was so social and lively. Thank you Dirt Dog!",

The menus here were extremely readable and you have more than a enough time in line to know what you want when you get to the cashier.   The cashier got everything correct in our order and made sure she repeated it so there was no mistake. Great cashier!   There is a sign attached to the straps that hold the line together. It says \"You cannot take a table unless you have paid for your order and got a number\". The reason for this is because there is only 10 tables in this place. No room at all.   We get our number and look around and there is a kid sitting at a big table all by himself. No parents, no food, or number on the table. The server brings our food and we pointed out that we needed that table and they weren't following the rules, that your business made. The server goes over and the boy tells her his family is in line. She comes back and doesn't do anything about it. She didnt wanna deal with it. So we stood there, with our food in our hand waiting for a table when there was one right in front of us but the employees wont inforce the rules.   We got a table right next to the kid and his family finally sat down 15 minutes later...   The food was great. No complaints there at all but I personally won't come back because that was completely disrespectful. You have rules, we are following them and you make us wait.   So my first time and only time coming to Dirt Dog.  Thanks for the great memories.",

They had several different card games that you could \"rent\" to play while you wait for your food. Although there was a long line and rude customers, the food actually got out fairly quick. Less than 10 minutes after ordering. I'm not a fan of all beef hotdogs, but if I was, I would say that it was decent. I didn't care for the bun, it made eating the hotdog nearly impossible without getting sauce all on your hands and face; therefore, I ultimately used a fork and knife. The corn in a cup was average. Putting lime on the corn gave it meaning.",

    "text": "This is some seriously supreme street food, but served in a stylish, enclosed diner-like atmosphere.  And never fear - vegan options are here!  I tried the vegan carnitas tacos. They were fantastic, and topped with guacamole and a few not-overly crunchy plantains. I believe they were $2.00 each taco.   I also was excited to test out the spicy elote which is basically just corn engulfed in hot cheetos along with the other standard elote toppings that street vendors usually include. I wasn't terribly impressed to be honest, but sometimes that happens when you get yourself too pumped up to try something new; you develop unrealistic expectations. However, it is a beautiful social media #foodporn photo post.  Speaking of social media, this location frequently utilizes Instagram to advertise their specialty items, and this successfully results in them being a thriving business. You may want to prepare for a large line at the register and no free tables, but maybe you'll get lucky?  I just love the art and alternative atmosphere. It's inspiring to see restaurants prosper when breaking away from traditional food service standards.",

    "text": "I was excited to get to try this place out as a friend suggested it had great food. Even for vegetarians and vegans, which is hard to come by!   Upon entering, you'll see this place has a very urban vibe to it. There's a corner of the wall that allows you to pin how far you drove to get there (all within the Las Vegas/Henderson valley, but it stops anywhere north of Charleston). Should extend the map to the ceiling!   I ordered a vegan taco and their elote fries without the bacon bits for roughly $8 all together.   It was delicious!! I thought $2 was expensive for 1 taco, especially once they finally served it to me because it was TINY. But it was all worth it at first bite. So flavorful, recommend trying it out.   Their elote fries were really good too. Comes with a lot for $5.50 and I couldn't even finish it all. Put some in a box and finished it once I got home.   Service was very fast and the cashier was super caring, ensuring each customer wasn't allergic to any of the ingredients in something they ordered (such as cilantro and citrus).   Overall, great food, great service, and great atmosphere. Very satisfied! Would return much more quickly if I lived closer.",

    "text": "My first time here, and I took it to go! The line may look intimidating but the cashier ushered through it pretty quickly. The atmosphere is great! Fun and lively. They have beers on tap, if that's your thing. It's not mine, but it's nice to know if I go here with my friends.   I ordered \"The House Dog\", \"Carne Asada Fries\", \"Dirty Corn\", and \"Dirty Esquite\". I wanted to try a little bit of everything. But I really came here looking for the elote or \"Dirty Corn\".   \"The House Dog\" is a bacon wrapped all beef hot dog with thousand island, onion, bell peppers, green chili spread, ketchup and mustard. I was a little skeptical of the ketchup and mustard, but it works. Absolutely delicious!!!  \"Carne Asada Fries\" is not to be passed up either. Yummy deliciousness in this brown little box. I couldn't wait to dive into the box and started eating them on the drive back to work. Pick de Gallo, crema, green onion, Carne Asada and fries. Maybe there was more to it. But this was soooo good!!  \"Dirty Esquite\" was just okay. Cup of corn, crema, cotija cheese, bacon, chili spices, cilantro and lime. I tasted some other flavors too.. but was overwhelmed by the saltiness. I'm going to have to pass on this one next time.  \"Dirty Corn\" .. the corn of my dream!!! Honestly, this dream will have to wait. I was so full from the other food that I couldn't stomach anymore!   \"Churro\" .. this one totally had promise! Fried choux pastry with cinnamon and sugar.. and don't skimp on the horchata whipped cream dippers thing. I took a bite and realized it was raw in the middle.   Overall, the food was reasonably priced. The House Dog is delicious! I'll have to try the street tacos next time. AND, if I had eaten the churro at the restaurant, I'm sure this would have been corrected.",

I understand the name and theme of your business is \"Dirt\" but that doesnt mean it actually has to be dirty and in this case filthy and disgusting.....  The theme is LA street food so I can look past all the graffiti in the bathrooms but they were dirty to the point of being a sanitary concern. Theres a ton of buildup and filth around the toilet and sink as well as the paper towel dispenser.   Fine it's a bathroom right? Doesnt end there sadly. The utinsels and the area surrounding doesnt look like it's been cleaned. Ever. Theres a layer of dust around all the forks and knives and I had to dig through half the stack of lids to find one that wasnt wet. No idea why 20 cup lids were wet but they were. Thankfully the straws are individually wrapped so I at least felt safe drinking from it.   The food was legit and is the only saving grace for this place and the only reason for 2 stars.",

This is the first time I've been back to Dirt Dog since they first opened their doors in Las Vegas - and may I just say, they have really stepped up their game!  Now in full disclosure the hot dog options were kind of...meh. The hot dog options never WOW me. Which is why I haven't been back in so long. The toppings overpowered the hot dog itself and I think it's completely pointless.   The Elote fries, however, are game changing! Man this stuff is good. I was a little skeptical at first, but Dirt Dog blew me out of the water with this one. The fries were crispy perfection and all the toppings perfectly blended together. Corn, lime mayo, cotija cheese, and freshly squeezed lime on top...I already can't wait to have it again.  I also had the garlic fries. Once again, fries were cooked to perfection. I think this dish would have been a lot better if it had MUCH more garlic. The garlic was almost non-existent. Which really sucks for a garlic lover like me. Maybe I'll ask for extra next time  I will be back. Even if only for elote fries alone.",

This place has you covered! When I first walked in I was almost in shock that it wasn't bigger. I saw a video on social media of this place so I guess I figured it would be bigger but it's just like any other restaurant. Its crazy because you get the feeling like you are really in LA. The wall art inside this place is amazing, the music they play is on point, and the food is just like if you are in downtown LA right in the fashion district.  The service is great and I definitely recommend this place to every foodie out there.",

    "text": "Theres been a lot of hype about this place so when i randomly found myself here for an afternoon bite, i was expecting a lot. Instead i found myself perusing a menu of various mexican inspired hotdogs and fries. Anything from elote fries to bacon wrapped jalapeno hot dogs topped with various sauces. I decided to start standard and got a basic bacon wrapped dog woth thousand island ketchup mustard and peppers. The hot dog itself is around $7 and then my basket of salt and pepper fries added on another $3 i just drank water. The food itself was ok. I wish i could find better words for it. I would go back to be a little more creative in my food choice but overall it wouldnt be the first place on my mind to.  UPDATE: dirt dog graciously let me come back and give their food another try. This time i had the elote dog same fries and fried oreos. I was much more satisfied with my meal. The hot dog itself is thick, and the butter bread really added to the flavor of the hot dog. I do feel like this is a place to take your bf or if you are hanging with the guys. But i would not oppose to stopping in again when i am in the area. Thanks alexis and priscilla for your suggestions and help!",

So many flavors going on, spicy, sweet, and salty. 2 of my friends in our party ordered their hot dog with the lobster roll bun, and they said it was so good. I had the original and thought it was good too. And the garlic fries were nice and crunchy, not too hard and not too soft. Our server also asked if we wanted complimentary ranch dips for the fries! Most places charge for sauce.. so that was a plus.  Nice size restaurant. Easy to find a seat and it was clean. The food came out fast! And the price was worth the food. Definitely keeping this place on my bookmarks.",

My friend and I care on a Monday morning after a weekend of partying. We needed something heavy to soak up all the alcohol we consumed. We walked in and loved the decor. There were wall murals and a nice painting of Ice Cube sitting near the cashier.  There were only a few people before us so we weren't in line long. I ordered The Elote Dog and fried Oreos, my friend ordered elotes, The Dirty Chili Dog and fried Oreos as well. I didn't want to share my Oreos with her anyway lol.   While waiting for food we sang a little bit because the music was jumping! Lots of 90's music. Some songs I hadn't heard in ages.  Both of our food was very delicious and  I'm glad i picked the elote dog because it combines my love for both. My fried was stuffed but we forced ourselves to eat dessert. The fried Oreos were EVERYTHING! The batter was light and the inside was so chocolatey. Ooh and the horchata cream that came with it was a perfect touch! When I come back to Las Vegas, Dirt Dog will definitely stay on my food list.",

    "text": "This was our second attempt visiting Dirt Dog, as the 1st time, they were so busy we couldn't step through the door! We realised after the fact, that there's a good reason they're so busy - they take what seems a simple concept, but they make it fun, relevant and they do it very well.  From what I understand, Dirt Dog is a business idea out of downtown LA and the influence of this area is seen all over the restaurant, from the wall murals, art and music. It lends itself to a relaxed, fun and interesting experience that you don't see so often in the valley.  Thankfully this time, it wasn't too busy as we walked in and we were greeted straight away by a really friendly staff member behind the till. She asked if we'd visited before and when we said no, she explained the menu, which is on the wall for everyone to see as they wait in line and she offered some recommendations.  My partner and I both went for the House Dog. While they use the simple, manufactured and frankfurter-style sausages that you see, the added ingredient, flavours and bacon-wrapped style they use really made it enjoyable and tasty! They were not stingy with any of the ingredients while at the same time didn't load everything on so much so that you couldn't appreciate the staple hotdog itself.  We also shared some elote fries which I thought were delicious! They were flavourful although the portion was a little smaller than I expected for the price. However, while saying that, they were loaded with toppings.  For an average appetite, a hotdog and shared portion of fries definitely filled me up but left me feeling comfortable and not bloated from any unnecessary grease and oils that I've found in other locations.  Definitely a treat, but a delicious one in an enjoyable and relevant space!",

I really could eat 3 in a sitting (and have, when my daughter and her little friend take two bites of theirs and I get to finish, haha)!!  So far, my fav is the red dog. I hate mayo or creamy things so I always forgo the aioli.   The garlic fries are super good too. I remember when Gordon Biersch was the only place I could find garlic fries. My, how times have changed!  I looooove the elote cups!  As much as I love Mexican street corn (without mayo barf), eating it in public whilst maintaining my lady like status is damn near impossible (I'm totally kidding; I'm not lady like esp if you've seen me with a Five Guys burger). But the cup of corn with the same stuff without having to eat off the Cobb is really what dreams are made of. Who has two thumbs and is giving this place two thumbs way up? This guy!",

Dirt dog has such a creative and diverse menu that makes each dog extremely unique and tasty. My boyfriend and I have been here a few times in the past and I definitely agree with the other reviews on here that this place is amazing. Since it does get pretty busy, especially during dinner time, we decided to call in an order for pick up tonight. We ordered the house dog, dirty chili dog, and a side of garlic fries. Once we got to the restaurant, there was a line that was nearly out the door. There was a little bit of a wait but it wasn't too bad once we finally made it to the cashier. The staff at the front were very nice and made sure that we had plenty of napkins and utensils once we got our food. Within minutes, we were out the door. We brought the food back home and devoured everything! I also loved the fact that the fries were left open in the container to prevent them from getting soggy. This place is a great spot for delicious hot dogs with excellent service. The prices are reasonable and the food is extremely filling. I highly recommend this place! We will be back for sure!",

Got two red dogs and dirty fries, $18. The hot dogs were ridiculously small and nothing special. Pictures were far better. Dirty fries were so so, but again, nothing special. They play music with cuss words, didn't bother me but beware if you have kids. Also, asked my toppings to be extra grilled, and they came out raw.        Giving them half a star for offering a veggie alternative, albeit if not 'sold out'. And for the small hot sauce selecetion. Borderline terrible otherwise, especially for the price. You can make 4x as good of hot dogs from your home microwave. Won't be back.",

And while we were sitting there eating somebody came out and said the kitchen made too much french fries would we like another. My friend and I were already splitting the container of fries , yes ,I said container. I told my friend just go ahead and bring those home for herself because I still had an almost full container after two people ate them.

The toppings of thousand island, bacon, and the Portuguese bun created a pretty sweet and savory meal, but very sweet. The veggie dog was a soy dog was basic and toppings took the show there, again, but was expected. The veggies were cooked with a good firmness. I was told the \"red\" was a mild spicy, but it came out a little too spicy. I would say an 8 out of 10 scale. My first veggie dog had an obvious hair on it when I opened the box, and it wasn't even busy. The staff was very accommodating and replaced it as well as refunded the entire bill (16 dollars was a surprise for two hot dogs) without me asking or fussing. I do appreciate that level of anticipation.",

    "text": "We went for the first time on Saturday. The cashier informed me they were out of corn which we were looking forward to their corn fries. I ordered garlic fries instead. Once I paid for our meal the cashier gave me the heads that our food would take about 25 minutes. We didn't mind, we were just excited to finally check this place out. We went during lunch so it was pretty packed but we were lucky to find a table quickly. 40 minutes later our first half of our order came out. I informed the server we were still waiting on our kids' meals. 15 minutes later he brought it out. The server informed me that there was a miscommunication and they would be paying for our food since we waited so long. The server was very nice and I appreciate they acknowledged how long we waited. I ordered the chili hot dog. It was worth the wait! Even though we did not get our food as quickly as others, we're still going back! We can't wait to try their corn fries!!",

This place uses hot dogs that would taste great on their own and are even better with all the cool toppings. Plus: horchata ice cream.   Also everyone was so friendly and sweet and have us some pumpkin spice ice cream to try. Super tasty!",

So when I heard about their Las Vegas location I was ecstatic. The cashier was attentive and did a good job of greeting us. We ordered 4 veggie dogs green style and fries. The fries were unappealing & tasted below average. Comparable to bad fast food fries. The veggie dogs came out impeccably horrible. Immediately the appearance was much different from my previous outing. The dogs themselves looked yellow. The toppings were poorly cut and the pieces were comically big. The dog was Las Vegas comparable dry. Very little sauce & the toppings were almost completely different than the Dirt Dog in LA we had a week prior. No salsa, very very little cilantro, bun was terrible, & the Veggie dog lacked any flavor and tasted like it was sitting in water for days. Wouldn't recommend this spot to anyone. It needs major research on its LA brethren.",

Ordered nuggets for my daughter yet they were completely burnt to where you can smell it. They should change their oil or pay attention to fryer more. Got a refund for her little meal. Ordered fried Twinkie and churro which were good though. Wouldn't recommend this place. Lots of nice advertising of their food but the quality wasn't there. Waiter who brought our food, young Asian kid was sincere and showed his concern when I showed him the burnt kids food. He offered to remake it but we had already waited 25 minutes and I felt bad she had to wait again. Ended up leaving unhappy but appreciative of the servers concern. Family and I won't be returning to Dirt Dog, would rather take the drive to Los Angeles for a real Dog. Wish I would of took pics of the nuggets but i was too concerned to feed my kid and rushed that dish back to the server. If you look closely at my elote dog you can see how dry it is, the hotdog itself is shrunken at the end.",

I'm a Vegas native and with the exception of one other hot dog resturant I have been repeatedly disappointed. Dirt Dog did not disappoint. They have the best hot dogs I've ever had in town. The resturant itself is really cool. Very clean and new. The staff was super friendly and Amber was a doll. We had the House dog and the Green dog. Both out of this world.We opted for the Green Dog on the butter Lobster roll which was phenomenal. For sides we had the street corn and the dirty fries. Both sides were perfect. And for dessert we tried the deep fried Oreos. Delicious. I literally do not have one bad thing to say about Dirt Dog except that I wish they had opened sooner :) great job. Hats off to the owners and operators you really should be proud.",

We ordered 2 hotdogs, 2 sides & 2 drinks. Total came to $27, that included tip, which I thought was kind of expensive! My hubby ordered the house dog & I ordered the teriyaki dog. When the hotdogs came I was disappointed b/c the buns were way bigger than the hotdog! I felt that my hotdog was a bit dried despite the fact it had teriyaki sauce on it. I would think they would top it off with lots of onions & bell peppers but it was short of it. I would normally would use a fork & knife at a hotdog gourmet place, but at this place I didn't have too. We also ordered chips & from the picture on the menu I thought it would be more like the chips you get from Buffalo Wild Wings, you know crispy on the outside but soft on the inside, it wasn't!   I think the best thing we ate was the corn esquite. Also, for a hotdog establishment I expected more beverage options, which they didn't have, however no big deal.   It was worth a try.",

I ordered it in a buttery lobster roll style bun which just made it even more gluttonous! The garlic fries were seasoned perfectly and the portion is definitely big enough to share. Beyond that they were playing such grest music. I look forward to my return!!",

I remembered seeing some friends check in here so I convinced him to come and check it out. The guy at the register was super friendly and walked us through the menu. I ordered the red dog and my husband got the green dog with a side of corn for my daughter. We decided to cut up both dogs when they arrived so we could both try each. We were blown away by the overall flavors and freshness of the dogs. I loved the red, definitely had a kick to it but the green was equally tasty in its own way. My daughter was a fan of the corn as well. We enjoyed the dogs so much that we decide we had to split the house dog and put in a second order in one sitting. It was delish but I still enjoyed the red the best. Highly recommend Dirt Dog for the food, ambience and awesome service.",

The service was painfully slow - and you order at a counter as you walk in. There was one other family in line and it took around 15 minutes for us to just place our order. Esquite was good, but again grossly overpriced, and the stupid expensive chili fries were soggy and bland. Will not be back.",

I had a vegetarian dog with a mixture of the green and red sauce with the lobster roll all the recommendation of the employee who was very helpful. YUM! The red sauce is pretty spicy and I like spice!   *disclamer for vegetarians, they make the veggie ones as ordered so it may take a while for yours.  Give the register guy a heads up if you're still looking at the menu but know for sure you're gonna get the veggie dog.    Their house made chips are bomb. The dirty fries are delicious and the sauce that comes with the garlic fries is really tasty.   The group before us bought all of the corn so it was a 30 minute wait for the next batch of corn to be roasted. We ended up staying long enough to get the cup of corn which was a nice (but kinda random) side dish.   Hubbs and his mom also enjoyed their hot dogs. I forget the one that the hubby got but he said it kinda tasted like a hamburger and that the bacon bits are legit. His mom had the teriyaki one that she gobbled up too. The menu isn't huge but I think it's enough to not be overwhelmed with choices. We will be back for sure, everything we had was good!",

Came in for my first dirt dog with my lady, the presentation is on point every thing that you order comes out looking like what they named it to the T. For me I guess I have had better hotdogs. It just seemed like the hotdog itself was extremely salty so any of the condiments or garnish you could possibly order you can't truly taste due to the saltiness. The idea is one of a kind I give 5 stars for creativity but the taste counts too! For example all I could taste on the Elote Dog was the cotija cheese and high amounts of sodium, usually corn is sweet  it was like extra filler corn very bland.",

Little did I know that when we did walk in, the place was completely empty. The only physical person we saw was one guy in the back in the kitchen area. I noticed that guy did glance at us but he didn't greet us until my boyfriend waved his hands in the air. We stood in the front scoping the menu for about ten minutes until a lady walked out from the back and told us \"She would be right with us.\" We we're in no rush so we didn't mind. It felt like another five minutes flew by until our order we finally taken. We were just questioning why it took so long to order and wondered if they just opened cause it looked like they were still preparing for the day.   When it came to the food, I got the Dirty Chili Dog. Right when it got served to me, I was very excited. The sauce was dripping down the bun and it overall looked stuffed. First bite, was outstanding! I got a taste of the flavors including the bacon bits. It was not until the middle of the dog that I realized that the bottom half of my bun was sort of hard. The only reason I didn't catch it right away was because the dog itself was covered in sauce. Other than that, my hot dog was pretty good. Not bad at all.   My boyfriend tried the tacos! $2 dollars a taco, he begs to differ. Out of the three tacos, he realized one of his tacos were cold. But the rest were like warm. Those were his only complaints about the tacos but overall they were pretty decent.   Would we come back to this place? Sure, if we were in the area and it was one of our last resort. This place was not bad at all.",

I brought the boo along this time and we came on a Saturday around 1 pm. The seating can fill up pretty quickly, but luckily we were able to grab a spot. I love the vibe, super chill and lots of Tupac.   This time around I also tried the garlic fries. I thought the taste of the fries were ok, but they were just missing some type of delicious dipping sauce. (3/5) The Elote Dog, my one True love, was just as good as I remembered. (5/5) You HAVE to get the lobster bun, it's so freaking good and no it doesn't actually have lobster in or on it.   I wish this place wasn't so far from my house, but maybe it's a good thing since I'd definitely be broke and 20 lbs heavier.",

The staff here is super nice and chill. I love that they have board/card games you can play while you wait for your food and/or eat!   The overall ambiance is fun and laid back, the food is great, the games are fun, but some things at Dirt Dog can be a bit pricey for those eating on a budget. I usually only go with one other person and we end up spending around $30, including drinks.  Dirt Dog is definitely one of my favorite places to get my grub on! It's totally on my list of restaurants when anybody asks me where they can get some good food with a fun ambiance! If you're craving something \"dirty\", go hit this place up!",

The fries were on point so crispy & fresh. The Elote was awesome & tasty. We ordered a lil bit of everything. I'm glad this place is near my sisters house. We definitely gonna come back w/the rest of the Fam Bam in San Diego. So on your next trip to Vegas you most definitely gotta check this place out. The music they got is bumpin old skool. From Debbie Deb to Biggie to Pac to Eminem. Bring it back way back",

I got the patty melt dog on a lobster roll and she got the ranchero dog on a regular bun and trust me it really hit the spot, plus neither of us had eaten all day and it filled us up so that's a plus! We also got the carneasada fries which were odd... I mean the fries were great, the meat was great, but together something seemed a little off. The more we ate it the more we questioned whether or not we really enjoyed them.   However 5 stars solely for the hot excuse me I mean dirty dogs! We will definitely be back and we look forward to trying their desserts which looked bomb to say the least!",

It was nothing but West Coast hip-hop from Tupac, Snoop, Dre and a few others sprinkled in there! I got the Elote Dog and the patty melt dog! Yum and for desert a fried Twinkie and homemade churro!

It's in an area that is newly built and we almost missed this place! It's hidden in the corner of this plaza area.  Wow the elote in a cup is awesome. We ordered 6 dogs between the two of us.  Told the hubby thats too much but he wanted to make sure we tried them all. We got the elote dog, dirty chili dog, house dog, red dog and honestly can't remember the last two. The ones I wasn't a fan of was the elote dog and one that had too much mayo on. The elote was better as a side cup and the one with with mayo, well too much mayo.  Now my hubby can say we came here. They do have good hot dogs and definitely get the elote in a cup, so worth it.",

To begin, this place is conveniently located on Rainbow Blvd right between Blue Diamond Road and 215 so it is really easy to access. There is also plenty of parking. The place is reasonably big and wasn't packed at all when I went there.  This place offers specialty hot-dogs for $5.95 and sides (Fries, corn, etc...) and desserts (Deep-Fried twinkies, oreos, and churros, etc...) for $2.95. But this place becomes even more interesting with their beer selection. Dirt Dog offers a rotating selection of craft beers that are absolutely amazing. Whether you like light or dark beers, citrus or grapefruit flavored beers, expect to find something you like there! Jesse was instrumental in introducing all these beers to us and making us have a great time there.   The atmosphere there is great and they even had a DJ and free cotton candy that day! In the end, I would definitely recommend this place as a must try in the Las Vegas area if you like hot-dogs and great craft beers. Feel free to message me for any additional details that you may need!",

Myself and another ordered the Patty Melt Dog on Texas toast, and a friend ordered the Elote Dog. The Patty Melt dog was to die for!! It was wrapped in bacon, topped with cheddar cheese fries and a chipotle aioli. Our friend said his elote dog was also delicious, the perfect balance between sweet & savory. We each ordered an elote, I got the classic Dirty Corn which did not skimp on the cotija cheese or yummy spices. We also ordered both of the new elote (not on the menu, it's the \"secret menu\" as the cashier told us). One was a Cheesy Cheeto elote, rolled in Cheetos and topped with melted cheddar cheese. The other was the Flamin' Hot Cheeto elote, rolled in Hot Cheetos and topped with melted cheddar cheese. Both were OUT OF THIS WORLD. They have soda in glass bottles, a good selection of beer, and did I mention Fried Twinkies?! We will definitely be back!!",

The servers were very nice and friendly, once you have finished placing your order, pick a table and they will bring the food to you.  I really enjoyed the food, but I wish they had a little bit more variety to choose from. The hotdog was huge, and the toppings really added to the flavor. The only thing I didn't quite enjoy was the dirty corn esquite elote because it was a lot smaller than what was pictured.",

I say this often, but being from NY I'm a food-snob about certain foods and hot dogs are definitely one of those items.  This place is legit!  I got the House Dog, the Red Dog and the Dirty Fries.    Both hot dogs were flavor explosions.  First off, one hot dog is a enough.  I ordered two because it was my cheat day and I couldn't decide, so I ate half of each.    The house dog with the bacon thousand island? Are you kidding me? Bacon Thousand Island? Then... more bacon? Soooooo good!  The Red dog just had such great flavor... smokey from the chipotle and some kick from the chili sauce...oh yeah, more bacon!  Can't pick a favorite here.  The only True winner was me since I got to try both.  The fries were solid, but I couldn't make my way through all of them.    They also have an impressive little beer list with a couple of nice craft beers.  This place is about twenty minutes from me, but it's worth the drive for another cheat day.",

There was great photo art on the walls of the hip hop legends. The menu looked amazing. I ended up ordering the Mutt (it was half and half...thought it would be a great way of tasting two hotdogs), garlic fries, and the Mexican street corn on the cob...I forget their name for it. So the corn came out first. It was really good. The only thing that was over the top for me is the bacon crumbles. I've NEVER seen that before. It wasn't terrible, I just like my corn the way it is supposed to come. The corn was still very good and I will definitely order it again. The hot dog and fries came next. I will get the fries out of the way. They started out 'okay'. I LOVE a good basket of fries topped with things and I was really leaning towards the Carne Asada fries or the corn fries, but since I was getting corn and a hot dog, I decided on the garlic fries since I also love garlic. The fries quickly went downhill as they were dripping in oil. They said all the fries are like that. They needed to be drained for a little while longer or something. I couldn't finish them because they were so gross and mad that I kept trying. Now on to the main event...the hot dog. The hot dog was good...yes. It was amazing...agree. It had a nice bite..like when you bite into a good hotdog, it shouldn't 'melt' and this one stood up under all of the stuff piled on top. The bread was perfectly toasted. The hot dog is a home run. I would give this place 3 stars because of the fries were that gross, but the hot dog, corn, and ambiance brought it back up to a solid 4 or even a 4.5. Just don't get the fries .",

I chose to get the veggie dog and my mom got the house dog and we also decided to try the elote  fries. They messed up our meal, but gave us the dog for free that they messed up on which was really nice of them. Everything was super delicious. I want to come back and definitely try the hot Cheetos elote. The decor was cool, music was on point, I will definitely be back. The only thing I wish they had was turkey dogs. I understand not everyone or a lot of people eat them, but I don't eat red meat or pig, and a turkey dog would've been amazing. The soy dog was ok, but turkey would've been good too. Either way, I'll be back.",

Anyway onto the new dog in the house .  First thing the employees were nice and the place was clean . 90's Hip Hop playin' , but not loud , Hip Hop Hooray . The decor is a little sparse , but it is a hot dog place . I got the House Dog on a Lobster Roll , Dirty Chili Fries , and Aqua Fresca for $17.05 , a little much .   The fries were really good and cooked just right and next time I want to get the corn . The hotdog was average size not a footlong or sausage , but wrapped in bacon . I like the peppers on it and the lobster roll was toasted just right . It was good , not great , but filling . I will try again and get that corn , it looks so good .",

I first ordered a house dog, I wasn't really a fan of mustard but Jayden described what was in it. I then got my hot dog and wasn't really a fan of the mustard, I felt so bad because she did tell me there was a lot of sauce in it. So my husband ate his elote dog and the house dog while I ordered another elote dog. I felt bad. Jayden turned it around and threw in another two fried Oreos with such superb service!!!! She needs to be promoted! She had a great smile as well and made me feel welcomed! Also the server with the red cornroll braids was such a sweetheart. I thanked them in advance. Great place to eat also the hot sauce wall is so cool and very great for an ideal hot dog place! Really awesome vibes here! Even beer was great!! Will def come back again with more people! Thanks Dirt dog!!!!",

I like that they have great tap beers and the cashier commented that he appreciates me exercizing my 2A rights and Nevada open carry (hurray for free states). I tried Dirty Fries and the hotdog that is like Mexican street corn (in fact it has corn in it) but the name escapes me at the moment. I definitely like the crazy flavor profiles of the fries and on the dog. I like that you can choose your bun, I like the lobster bun. There is nothing I don't like about the place. I'm glad it's 8 miles away or I'd be 500lbs! I definitely have to try all the rest of the dogs and fries, but the service and what I've tried so far have been awesome. I really do wish they had a plain hotdog option. Of course they might but I didn't look all that well.",

    "text": "Although I enjoy their food as stated before, I am still running into issues each time I visit. This time, I placed a phone order which I have done since visiting this establishment (over a year and a half). I normally order one or two items and with a toddler it is easier to call before to avoid long wait times. Upon arriving, I stood off the the side (at second cash register) as I have done in the past and have seen others do, only to be informed that even though I placed a phone order I would need to stand in the regular line (which we all know, is never short or quick.)   After standing in line, I asked the employee at the register, when they started implementing having to wait in the regular line for a phone order, and was informed that it has \"always been that way.\" Honestly at that point I wasn't surprised that I was questioned if I had ordered at the right place since they couldn't find my order as my name or number wasn't taken over the phone.   Food is great but honestly not worth the trouble as I ALWAYS run into something when I order from this establishment.  If you do choose to go, make sure you go with plenty of time and don't go if you are in a rush.",

I got the Carne Asada fries, fried Oreos, Dirty Esquite (elote corn in a cup basically) and my Fiance got one of the hot dogs. The Carne Asada fries are probably the best ones I've ever had, because the fries were so crispy! Even with all the toppings on them. I didn't finish them all and was able to take them home later and they were still crispy! The fried Oreos were amazing, I should've ordered more of them, since there are only two in each order. This place was bomb. We were in the area yesterday and decided to try it, but we are going to make the drive out here again just to eat here!",

Red dog was slightly sweet with a nice spicy flavor. Hot dog texture was perfect, and bun wasn't oily. Thumbs up here. The elote dog was tangy, sweet, and very savory. I also sampled the mutt dog and the dirty chilli dog. Out of the four, my favorite so far is the chilli dog. Fries came out crisp and a little oily at the bottom. They were lightly salted as well. Garlic fries use minced garlic and not powder. You get really nice bites.  Super worth.  If you need to eat hot dogs, this is a dope spot.  Will eat again!!",

People were trying to order them and 24 hours later the cashier with the green lipstick (WTF??) still hadn't gotten the word. The customers were arguing with her and the sign was still up, so she had to go check. Added another 2 minutes to my wait.   So when I finally got to order my garlic fries to go, Green Lips didn't tell me until AFTER I paid that there was going to be a wait for them because they \"just had a big order\". I asked how long, and she said 12 minutes. Had I known, I'd have walked, but maybe she suspected that and that's why she didn't tell me until it was too late.   So, 30 minutes out of my life for garlic fries. Admittedly they were good, and I originally gave Dirt Dog 3 stars for that reason. But writing this review got me all reeled up again and I'm taking away a star. Take that, you Dirty Dirt Dog!",

It's always a good experience here, I always love ordering a full meal as in a hot dog, fries, elote, a dessert and a drink. It's not terribly priced you get what you pay for.  The only thing I would caution about is the garlic fries are deadly and they aren't so unique. Just tons of minced and juiced garlic with fries, it's nothing special I wouldn't order it again.

I got the veggie dog and a friend of mine did the patty melt. I'll say I was disappointed with the veggie dog. It's pretty much the same soy dog you can buy at the grocery store and it taste like I had cooked it. A lot of places try putting vegan items on the menu and unfortunately can't really go pull it off. My friend who had the patty melt said it was phenomenal and even got another to go. Overall I'd say go it's very cute and food is supposed to be good. For my fellow vegan/vegetarians I'd say skip it and go to a place specifically for veggie lovers",

    "text": "Oh. My. God. I cannot say enough good about this establishment. My husband and I were searching for a place to eat for dinner on a Friday night, and we came across Dirt Dog online. It was 12 miles from us, but the reviews were overwhelmingly positive and it had been a while since we'd had a good hot dog; so we made the drive across town. We walked in around 7 PM, and the line was nearly out the door. We thought about coming back another time, but we had already driven all the way across town, so we stayed. And thank the good lord above that we did. The line moved much faster than we expected; and once we ordered, they had our food at our table in approximately 6 minutes - which was astounding, considering how busy they were.   We ordered two hot dogs, an order of dirty fries, and a churro with HORCHATA WHIPPED CREAM *screams internally*. This only set us back $23 (not bad for a Friday night dinner, in my humble opinion). Their Portuguese bread is perfectly sweet, and pairs wonderfully with the sweet corn and lime mayo on the Enote Dog; and the lobster bread (more buttery, and $0.50 more) was also very delicious and tasted splendid with the House Dog.   Needless to say we devoured our food - every bite of which was absolutely incredible. We will most certainly be coming back. A 12 mile drive is a small price to pay for one of the best hot dogs in the city.",

    "text": "THAT HOTCHATA SPREAD THOUGH.   Ive been wanting to check out Dirt Dog after seeing pictures all over IG. I knew they had an LA location so I was excited to see that they opened one here in Vegas.   Came here on a Saturday night around 5 pm. We started off with some elotes aka \"dirty corn.\" The elote was bomb dot com, spread with lime infused mayo and butter compote and topped with cotija cheese, cilantro, and chili powder! With every bite, I could taste all the ingredients. It was so flavorful, and I don't remember enjoying corn as much as I did here.   We tried a few of their hot dogs which included the Red Dog, Green Dog, Mutt Dog, and the House Dog. My favorite was the Mutt Dog, which is half Green Dog and half Red Dog. The Green Dog is topped with their homemade guac, chimichurri sauce, onions, bell peppers, and lime, while the Red Dog comes with a spicy tomato chile and chipotle aioli sauce. Besides all the fresh toppings and condiments, what makes these hot dogs so great is that all the sausages come bacon wrapped and placed in a lobster bun. The lobster bun adds some sweetness and butteriness to the hot dog and another level of awesome altogether.   The fries were also really good, perfectly crisp and crunchy. The Filthy Fries were straight up filthy (in positive terms). The cheddar sauce was freakin amazing, and I wanted to spread it all over my hot dog. Talking about spread, I gotta come back to that horchata spread. Oh man, the desserts here are off the charts! I would come back just for the desserts alone. The fried Oreos were to die for along with the fried Twinkie. The batter was killer, and it was the best fried oreo I've ever had. They both came with this Horchata whipped cream, and I don't wanna hype it, but that Horchata spread was so damn good that I wanted to shed a tear.   The entire staff was super friendly, and big ups to Tiffany for her excellent service and explaining every single dish down to all the nitty gritty details.   Excellent food and superior service. Doesn't get better than that. Dirt Dog is a place you do not want to miss here in Vegas.",

We only got the tacos and fries though.   Elote Fries: The fries were crispy and golden. They put a lot of cheese on the top and there was corn and bacon mixed in with the fries. The fries were decent, but I probably wouldn't order them again.   The House dog and dirty chili dog: All the hot dogs come wrapped in bacon, which adds a lot of flavor.  Overall, the hot dogs were okay. Definitely not the best hot dog I have ever eat, but it wasn't bad. A bit overpriced for one hot dog though.",

I don't eat meat but once every other month or so I might decided to indulged in some animal protein. Boy am I happy I picked this place. I ordered the house Dog. No belly issues either. The place is clean and very hype. Mixed crowd with old, young, family's, hipsters a little bit of everyone. The decor fits. It reminds me of being back home in Cali. LA style.. They have music playing too.  ORDER ON YOUR WAY THERE! There WILL be a long line.  Think about in and out...  They offer several types of bread for the dog. I opted for the butter toast. Omg!! Yes! The fries were crispy and delicious too. My husband said  his dog was perfect. So this is a gem guys. Go and get your hot dog on.. 5 stars",

    "text": "DIRT DOG IS F***ING AMAZING!   Tucked away in a small retail plaza on Rainbow just north of Blue Diamond, Dirt Dog offers some bomb-ass hot dogs, fries, and fried desserts.   The space is actually quite bigger than you'd expect, and they're actually not that busy...probably in part due to the remoteness of their location (but that's perfectly okay by me).   Get the Dirty Chili Dog. It's the best dog they offer. Bun, bacon-wrapped dog, hearty meaty chili (no beans), cheese, onions, cilantro, and chili aioli. Perfection. The chili has spice, but not heat. And if you can manage to get that perfect bite of everything together, you'll be a customer for like.  The second-best product Dirt Dog offers is the Deep-Fried Oreos. Seriously. You need these in your life. They offer the perfect contrast to everything you just experienced with your Dirty Chili Dog. They're not overly-battered or greasy, they're sweet, warm, and the perfect texture.   You NEED Dirt Dog in your life. Next time you're nearby, give it a go. You won't regret it. In fact, you'll probably be back next week.",

    "text": "Dirt Dog is a great option for a quick, affordable bite for lunch or dinner. Incredibly high quality bacon wrapped hot dogs and so much more!   They have a wide selection of over the top dogs; don't skip the lobster roll bun- it's delicious and helps to keeps all the toppings contained. The Elote Dog is my personal favorite, I have ordered it both times I have been there following a hosted event.   They have the usual suspects for sides, some also taken to the next level with toppings. But for a hot dog joint, the most notable thing on the menu is their vegan taco.. yes, you read that right- VEGAN TACO! They offer a few varieties of street tacos but the soyrizo is the best in my opinion, even for meat eaters.   They also offer a decent selection of beers, fried Oreo desserts, and a True to their LA roots atmosphere, complete with Tupac music and murals. They also have a fun map mural that serves as an interactive guestbook, allowing guests to pin where they live in the greater Las Vegas area.",

I've been meaning to try their other hotdog options but I can't get enough of the green dog. Bell peppers, bacon and a bunch of other goodness wrapped in your choice of roll. I prefer the lobster roll. Mmmmm..... I also enjoy their Dirty corn (Mexican style) and Horchata ice cream with a churro on the side. Again mmmmm... The atmosphere is very nice. Cute place that plays old school hip hop. The staff are always friendly when I come here. My only complaint or I shouldn't say complaint is I wish they had a location closer to my side of town. I only get to visit every blue moon when I'm running errands on the southwest side. Oh well.. (Shrugs shoulders). Great place! Great Food.",

Walked in the food was good but not a wow factor for the price i paid for my meal. I ordered the elote hot dog which i could have made myself. Which is just grilled corn with sour cream cotija cheese and cilantro and lime wedge for garnish on a hotdog. Looked pretty. A tiny little basket of fries over sauced to soggyness were decent nothing too over exaggerate about. All of this for about $20. Way to overpriced for a hotdog and fries joint. The place is pretty cool with the murals on the walls of LA and LA celebrities also part of those murals. I definitely went out of my way find this spot looking for the hype everyone speaks of. Located far on southwest side of town. If im ever in the area again i MIGHT stop bu just for a hotdog but not driving 30min out of my way just for this again.",

Also I noticed a lot of people did not like the 90s rap but if you don't like it don't eat there! It is clearly a CA owned business! Im from Cali! We love love love Tupac!

When i walked into the Rainbow LV location, first thing that caught my eye was the artwork and layout--- im an artist on the side myself and I can appreciate the art and layout.  The music gave me the feel of being in the SoCal area--- but we are here to talk about the food.  I moved to Vegas a year ago for my job and i'm enjoying myself (NorCal born and raised).  I've hit 28 out of 50 states in my travels and have tried great tastin dogs all over the US.  I went with the Elote Dog and right at my first bite, i was hooked.  The Dog isn t heavy or too overwhelmed with fixins...its just the right amount and the recipe and flavor combos are simply amazing.  I love corn kernels and the other fixins, sauces and spices were simply addicting!  I didnt want the experience of eating this dog to end!  Lol---I will tell all my coworkers and friends of this spot.  Keep up the great work people--- good stuff!!",

The cashier was very helpful in clarifying any questions we had about the items and in giving recommendations. I ended up going with the Elote Dog, my friend got the Flaming Dog, and we shared Al Pastor Fries. The Elote Dog was so good!! It was flavorful but not too salty, and squeezing some lime over it added a nice touch. The Flaming Dog was good as well (although I only had a bite since I'm not great with spicy). I really liked the Al Pastor fries. The fries were cooked nice and crispy, the meat was delicious, and the addition of pineapple was refreshing. While it was pretty filling, I didn't feel super heavy and weighed down afterward. I also appreciate that it didn't feel or taste overly greasy/oily. I'm definitely going to come back again to try more off the menu!",

Do y'know which ones I'm talking about? ...You probably do. They're almost pornographic, in a food way.  But, anyway: I ordered the House Dog on a Portuguese bun with a side of Elote Fries.  Both were astounding! The hotdog was massive and packed with flavor. I sorta wish I had been a little more daring with my choice of dog though. The House Dog was tame compared some other options on the menu... But still tasty nonetheless!  Truthfully, it was the side of fries that stole the show for me. Just imagine: crispy, salted fries soaking up all the flavor from the creamy, lime-y corn. It's almost as if the two were meant to be combined!  I'll definitely be back to try some more.",

I'm normally a plain dog eater, maayyybe a dot of mustard or kraut. So I was expecting a kick to the face of intense flavors. I was pleasantly surprised (shocked, even) that the dogs are balanced and not overpowering. They're delicious!! The Elote Dog is EVERYTHING. Also the best jamaica drink I've tried. And do yourself a favor and get some deep fried oreos with horchata whipped cream.   While I love the 2pac and old school tunes they play, I do wish they were the edited versions since I bring my kids here.  Tip: Allow yourself ample time when coming here. They prepare each item fresh and it's a smaller mom-n-pop-type shop, so they have a smaller staff. Don't expect to be in and out like you would getting a dog at sam's club.",

    "text": "\"Six-deuce every time, I never had the Heinz.  Fifty-seven can't ketchup to mines.\"  Jay-Z, Maybach Music 2 (Lost Verse)  L.A. loved and Vegas presented, Dirt Dog has spread its wings from The City of Angels and crash-landed in Sin City.  So hot!  We had just arrived in Vegas, buzzed and hungry, well past noon.  Southwest Airlines had a retiring pilot who ended up buying drinks for all the passengers on board in celebration of his retirement.  I guess when the pilot is buying, the flight attendants gets liberal with the booze because I needed food in me like 30-minutes ago.  After flipping through some bookmarks, Dirt Dog was chosen.  You know it hit the spot because we got dirty... so sooo dirty!  We got the Elote Dog on Texas toast [$7.25 + $0.50 for the lobster roll], a Dirty Chili Dog on Portuguese bun [$7.25], and one order of the Filthy Fries [$5.50].  That Texas toast was so buttery and crispy, it was hard trying not to moan with every bite.  If you love Mexican street corn, elote is for you.  The Dirty Chili Dog was a sodium bomb.  The Portuguese bun is slightly sweet so it helped off-set the saltiness a little bit.  Of the two dogs, I'd choose the Elote Dog over and over again.  As for the fries, they were amazing.  The Filthy Fries were topped with guacamole, chipotle aioli, cheddar, and cotija cheese.  I can imagine sitting back on a velvet couch with Chrissy Teigen in nothing but matching silk robes, eating these fries, while John Legend writes ballads on his piano about how awesome it is that I stole his wife.  He can keep Luna though.  She's cute but I ain't nobody's step-mom, okay?  So a place with 90's hip hop? Uh, yes please!  The staff is charismatic and friendly, the atmosphere is fun, and the food is great.    TL;DR  I believe Knockin' Boots said it best in, \"The Original Hip-Hop:\"  \"Ooh boy I love you so. Never ever ever gonna let you go, once I get my hands on you!\"",

I got the ranchero dog and it came with beans tortilla chips, a red sauce and a fried egg. It was definitely messy but in a very good way. The red sauce had a little kick to it that really balanced everything out. My one complaint is that I really couldn't taste the beans. I think if I could have it would have been the perfect hot dog.  My brother and I went in there on a Friday a 2 pm and the place was packed. I was prepared to wait at least 20 min for my food, but it only took 5 to 10 min.

We happened to be in the area and when someone suggested Dirt Dog for dinner, I immediately said yes! The menu is fun and attractive to the eye. We were torn between all the options. I personally ended up going for the Elote Dog on the butter toast. Having had authentic Mexican elotes many times in the past, I really had an expectation. Sadly, I was disappointed. I honestly didn't taste any of the \"corn\" flavor whatsoever. The hotdog overpowered all the toppings. That hotdog would've been good with regular hot dog toppings. I didn't try any of the other dogs at the table, so can't really say much there. I did have the horchata ice cream which was realllly good and actually tasted like horchata. Customer service was great, tables were clean, so no complaints there. Would I come back? Not unless I'm in the area and I am craving the horchata ice cream.",

Finally we decided to go one night. Walking into the place  I got an LA vibe, and was chill. The menu is posted on the wall next to the register with pictures and helpful descriptions of each item. The staff was cheerful and very helping. It could have maybe needed some more seating accommodations in the place do to the high volume. The food came out quicker than I thought. We both ended up getting the Elotes Dog and it was alright. It could have been a lot better with a signature sauce with the dog, but it was still very enjoyable. Now the fries were amazing. I was impressed by how they tasted. The chili fries were great. I would highly recommend them to all my friends. Overall I enjoyed it and felt very satisfied. Also it would be so convenient to open a location elsewhere around Vegas. I'll definitely be going to Dirt Dogs again.",

But let me tell you, this place is more than just hot dogs, they are dirty style type dogs. I ended up getting the green dog in a lobster roll type bun, chimichurri sauce, guacamole, sauteed onions, and grilled red peppers. It was packed with flavor, I pretty much ate the whole thing in under 5 minutes. I wanted to savor the flavors, but man it's a hot dog with a flavor punch. I also decided to go with their salt and pepper fries, elote (Mexican corn on a cob), and deep fried Twinkie! Hello! Everything was great, not overly greasy ( and that's including the deep fried Twinkees and fries ) and hey guys who live on the Southwest side of town, here is a great place to get an elote --- you don't have to drive all the way to the Eastside. Overall very informing cashier/server, service was good, it had a nice vibe with the throwback music, and just a place I want to throw a beer back with good eats.",

I would give 5 stars but it's pretty busy on a Friday almost so busy u could be having to take ur food to-go as there's no place to sit & eat. There should be an app to order & pick up for carry out as it would lessen the congestion during busy times. The atmosphere is dope with 90's hip-hop playin in the restaurant with radio friendly edits. The dedication to 2Pac is a nice touch as well. I did go there twice in 1 week so I must say I look to return soon to dive more into the menu!!!",

    "text": "If you're ever looking for a wonderful and unusual twist on a hotdog, then I have found the place for you! Dirt dog has been a local favorite in LA for years and has been coined \"The Official Hotdog of Los Angeles.\" Well guess what? It has finally come to Las Vegas! If you don't know what a Dirt dog is, here is a quick explanation. It is a 100% premium all beef weiner that is wrapped in a center cut slice of bacon, then served on your choice of bun and topped off with either the menu selection of toppings, or they allow you to create your own by mixing and matching for your own unique experience. This is Hands down the best Street dog I have ever tasted. The hotdog is never greasy and always tastey and served on a toasted, warm bun. Then they give you the perfect amount of topping to dog ratio and serve it to you al la carte or with a side of fries and drink if you choose. They are also open late for those of you who have a late night craving and they have a location on The Strip inside of Ballys. Seriously, this hotdog will curb any craving and your only regret is that you didn't buy 2",

The only problem for me is because Im such a picky eater its hard to order anything without asking them to leave one or more items off. For instance the first time I came I got the patty melt dog but the chipotle sauce was way too spicy for me. I'll have to ask for nada next time. Then I got the chili cheese fries.  Very good but I have to ask for no cilantro and probably no onion next time as well, as it became a bit overwhelming.    What I love with no issues here is the watermelon agua fresca. Perfect balance of sweet and fresh.  The kids meals are huge. My girls especially love the oreos included. I'm looking forward to trying some deep fried treats when I feel like being a heifer. I also just learned about an horchata ice cream or drink that I would love to try as well.   Overall,  i will definitely be a regular. Thanks for the tasty food and cool vibe inside.",

Hot dogs are cooked to perfection! Love that the bun isn't a \"bun\" in the traditional sense, giving you a different experience both in taste and texture. The toppings go from end to end, so you get a great hot dog-to-toppings ratio in each bite.

    "text": "I wanted to love this place but I just can't. We walked in to a bunch of people gathered around the menus posted on the wall. They told us to go ahead around them since it was their first time and they weren't ready yet. We told them that it was ours as well and stood behind them. Meanwhile, there are 3 employees behind the counter talking to each other. No one bothered to ask us if we needed help. As we were placing our order, a couple came in reeking of marijuana. This is obviously not the establishments fault and I'm not rating low because of this. I suppose it's unavoidable as the food that Dirt Dog serves qualifies as \"munchies\" material. Anyway, this caused my husband to rush the order and urge me to find a table and get away from the stench.   I got a chance to look around, decor is minimum with posters of rappers. There was a wall of hot sauce, loved that. We ended up choosing a table that was isolated so that we wouldn't end up near the couple that was high, I'm extremely sensitive to the smell and didn't think it would go well if I was to throw up mid meal.   Our order came quick enough and it looked just as appetizing as the pictures on the menu, which is rare so that was a nice surprise. We ordered an elote dog on a lobster roll, al pastor fries, and the horchata ice cream.   Elote dog- pretty good, we liked this better than the al pastor fries. The elote was decent, definitely not real Mexican quality but good enough. My husband, who had Dirt Dog before, said the lobster roll made a big difference.   Al Pastor fries- wayyyyyy too salty, fries were cooked well but fries are hard to mess up.  Horchata ice cream- not enough horchata flavor, it was more vanilla with a very slight taste of cinnamon. I've made horchata ice cream that tastes better. It was topped off with Rice Krispies and stale peanuts. The churro that was served with it had a good enough flavor but it was too dense.   Overall, the meal fell a little flat. If you're planning on ordering fries and a hot dog, I definitely recommend splitting it with someone as the servings are quite generous. We may return to try it out again and maybe order some different things but we won't be in a rush to do so.",

The fries however, I thought was so powdered that it could not really mix well with the fries.  At a certain point, I just felt like I was eating powder.  I was hoping it could mix or melt into the fries more.  Other than the fries, I had a good meal and made me feel very content.  There's not much else to say, it's just a good hotdog.

    "text": "In this review I will talk about the good, the bad, and the ugly. I was a little disappointed with Dirt Dog and it hurts me to say that. I am from East L.A. and bacon wrapped street hot dogs are famous all over L.A. So I was excited when I heard Dirt Dog was an L.A. style hot dog joint that opened in Las Vegas not too long ago.   First the good. The bacon bits and chorizo toppings on the hot dogs were an amazing combination. I ordered the Dirty Chili Dog and I never imagined that chile goes well with chorizo and bacon bits. The onions and cilantro on the hot dog were also a surprisingly good topping. I believe the toppings are the real winner here.    Now the bad. The flavor of the hot dog itself was just average and it did not leave much of an impression on  me. These are all beef Nathan's Hot Dogs? Hmmm... You get three choices of buns for your hot dogs. They are traditional, Portuguese, and lobster roll (not lobster flavor). I went with the traditional bun and I was in for unpleasant surprise. I grab the hot dog and after the first bite my hot dog sliped down through the bread and fell on my plate (see the pic).  I only had bread and toppings on my hands and strugggled to put the hot dog back in the buns. I wonder if the other hot dog buns hold the hot dog better. I also ordered the Dirty Chile Fries and found the fries dry and salty. This was a serious sodium overdose lol. I could not finish eating my food...what a bummer.   And finally the ugly. After I placed my order I walked around the dining area to get a table to sit at. I sat down and to my shock my table was dirty. I had to grab a few napkins to clean the top because it was full of crumbs. Yes I could have sat at another table but noticed the other tables had some debris on them as well. And finally the price of the food in my opinion was expensive. Almost 15 bucks for a hot dog, chile fries, and a soda...no bueno.   So there you have my honest review. I can not give this place one star because it has potential to really be a great place. If Dirt Dog had specials on specific days or 2 for 1 hot dogs this would get a higher rating from me. But for now it is what it is.",

The lobster roll style bun was also great. The dirty fries were okay, a bit too salty, but and a lot of them were overcooked and hard. The hot dog was good enough to keep this score at 5 stars, but improving the quality of the fries would be much appreciated. Overall I recommend, probably the best hot dogs in Vegas.",

I was going to a show at the South Point Hotel that evening so I took a bit of a detour to get there.  There's a sign for the restaurant facing Rainbow Boulevard but the entrance is on the other side of the building.  There is plenty of parking in this strip mall.  Enter from the parking lot.  You first come to a rope line for when it's busy.  There's a menu board on the wall to your right.  When you get to the register, place your order.  I ordered a red dog--a hot dog with spicy tomato chili sauce and chipotle aioli.  It also comes topped with bacon bits.  For my dirty side, I got garlic fries--tossed with house made garlic oil, garlic seasoning, and garlic bits. (It's for the garlic lover.  You'll be tasting garlic for a few hours.)  I also got an iced tea.    The person at the register will ask about dining in or to go.  If you're dining in, they'll give you a plastic number tag to place where you sit.  While they're doing their thing, go to the beverage area and get your drink.  That's also where you'll get plastic cutlery, napkins, and salt/pepper, etc.  I was just seated from getting my drink when a worker brought my dirt dog.  The red dog is spicy.  The dogs are moist and the toppings will get on your fingers so make sure you get enough napkins.  The fries were outstanding.  Crisp with lots of garlic.    I'll have to make this detour more times.  It's a good stop.",

    "text": "It's been a while so same drill as always: Customer Service, Ambiance, and - most importantly - FOOD!  Customer Service: Last time, I have to say I didn't have a good grasp of the customer service in this place. We ordered at the counter and it was brought to us the end but this time was different. When we ordered I had ordered a bottled coke to go with my meal but I was taking it home after. When the cashier realized this she offered to just put it in the fridge and I could grab it when I left so that it was cold. There were servers and both were fairly attentive. I wish they had name tags so I could thank them by name but both were great. The checked up on us and made sure we were good.   Ambiance: Nothing's changed about the way I feel about the place. It has bits and pieces of LA atmosphere and a very cool mural in the back of the restaurant. The one thing that I absolutely love though would be the huge map of vegas. Sadly it doesn't show my part of town but I love the concept of placing your mark at a place you've visited.   Food: I ordered a patty melt dog and an order of elotes fries. I loved the patty melt dog it was super messy but overall delicious. The elotes fries left something to be desired. I love the idea but there was nothing really sticking the corn and the cheese to the fries I was essentially eating fries and using a spoon to eat the corn and cheese. I wish there was something to have the corn and cheese stick to the fries. It might be a heck of a lot more messy but easier to eat everything together overall.  All in all, I will come back here in the future. I love the place as a whole and want to try everything on their menu gradually.",

It is a little overwhelming but the cashier was very helpful. I'd recommend going before rush hour or after for your first time because it does get busy and you don't want to hold up the line with questions.   They have a fairly small menu but it all looks good. They even have a veggie dog for those of you that don't eat meat.   Received my food really quickly! It was hot and delicious and went wonderfully with the beer. I'd go back to try other dogs and maybe even some of the desserts.",

Informed us what DD about, good things to try, etc. service is great here!  We decided to try the elote dog & carne asada fries. I thought the dog was very flavorful! Quality beef dog with great seasonings, creamy sauce. A bit messy to eat but good! The carne aside fries were pretty good. The fries themselves were the seasoned kind that I love! They were cooked perfectly. More carne asada & sauce would have made them even better.",

So many options to choose from with all menu items, there's likely to be something for everyone. Everything is unique, EVERYTHING is delicious.  Aside from good food, they had good service, the place was well kept, and the food was ready quickly. Overall, an \"A+\" experience. I wouldn't change anything about it. Can't wait to go back!",

    "text": "This hot dog joint is SoOooOoo DIRTY. In a good way!  Dirt Dog brings Its big fat fun Los Angeles street food menu to Southwest Las Vegas. Excellent! This side of town needed a shakeup from the big box food joints we've been seeing pop up over the years.   Almost everything on the Dirt Dog menu is piled with more stuff than you can shake a corn cob skewer at! The hot dogs are loaded, the corn on the cob is loaded, the fries were super crispy, and yep - LOADED WITH DIRTY GOODNESS  Our table ordered  Dirty Corn Garlic Fries Street Tacos (Chicken) The House Dog Dirty Chili Dog   The hot dog is sausage sized so the hot dog itself is gigantic. Depending on what type of dog you get, there is a heaping pile of stuff slapped on top. Prepared to get sloppy!  Everything was super tasty, the staff was really friendly and atmosphere was fun. It was packed on Sunday at 4:30.   Prepare for an 80's / 90's hip hop/rap vibe. I was really happy when Biz Markie hit the speakers \"OH BABY YOU - GOT WHEN I NEEEEED -YOU SAY SHES JUST A FRIEND....\"  The only problem with Dirt Dog is the location. It's located behind another store front off of Rainbow.  The parking is a little rough too. Lots of car jockeying going on.   Another small issue with our visit was that Dirt Dog's air conditioner was broken. You would think that alone would turn my fat ass away from the place, but I honestly didn't notice until the end of the meal when I was sweatin' n' eatin'!  I give Dirt Dog 3 stars because, let's face It, it's a street food joint with seats. If I was only rating hot dog joints, I would give Dirt Dog a solid 4.5 stars. I can't compare this place with a Chef Marc's.  I recommend everyone check out Dirt Dog. You'll have fun and eat some really flavorful things. Make sure you think of me if/when Biz Markie comes on the speakers.   :)",

They are creative with their food and you could eat there often and not burn out because of all the choices they offer.   We have tried a few of their hot dogs, our favorites being the patty melt, mutt dog and the dirt chili dog. Besides the hot dogs their dirty esquite, garlic fries and churro's are also favs.   They have a friendly staff, and when ordering they are always patient no matter how long the line is. When we visited today, they were packed with a steady flow of people lined up out the door and the service was still top notch, they seemed to thrive in the high paced environment.  With the amount of business they get, they may need to invest in more space, as there were no tables available to eat so you had to keep an eye out to rush to a table once it opened.",

We also shared the dirty chili cheese fries. It had chorizo in it- it was amazing ! Prices are not bad and it does fill up! Not a lot of sitting room. But if people come a lot that's a good thing!! I think if you expand you should come to Centennial area or the east side!",

This place primarily focuses on hot dogs so if you're a hot dog fan like me, you've come to the right place my friend. They have a variety of different dogs you can choose from. My personal favorite is the Red Dog but you really can't go wrong with any of them.  While their hot dogs are widely celebrated, their tacos are underrated and also very tasty. I always order one hot dog and taco because ordering just one doesn't quite fill me up. I admit the food takes a while to come out but once it does your patience will be rewarded!  Solid choice for lunch, you should check it out!",

The first thing that hits you is cumin and just has a stench to it. Definitely something you can't eat if you go back to office cause you're going to have an odor  Disappointed completely by the taste- and how they say LA street food. I got better elote from a vendor that used to stand outside my middle school. So not worth it. Rather make it myself",

When you first walk in, it's a little crammed from the front the entrance and where you order. The art work is nice and matches the music they play.   Once you order, you find a seat and they bring you your food. A lady also came by to give us utensils and napkins. They had quite a few people there but our food came out within 10 mins.   We ordered The House Dog, Dirty Chili, and Patty Melt. We each tried each other's dogs and 2 out of 3 of us liked the House Dog better but they were all very good. So good, they came back here two more times to try something different lol.   I am not someone who really enjoys hot dogs but this was actually pretty good.",

The dip was a bit bland but honestly the fries didn't need a dip.",

Sure they did an amazing job creating an awesome video, too bad the food does not replicate it. Overall, food was just so so. Certainly not worth $9 for a 6in hot dog.",

They enjoyed eating here and there were plenty of booths, so it was easier to take care of the little ones.   They offer five variations of dogs with three choices of buns and six sides. Although I wish they had more options, I was satisfied with my red dog (even though I'm not a big fan of hot dogs). I also had garlic fries and the elote in a cup - so good and easy to eat!!! They do offer veggie dogs as well, so that's helpful for anyone that's trying to decide with vegetarian friends where to go for lunch without having to settle for \"healthy food.\"  Outside, there is not much parking, but the other businesses don't have much traffic either.",

We had the original dirt dogs, the carne Asada fries, the garlic fries and the dirty esquite! It was heaven!!!! We finished everything but the fries(so heavy but yummy). But we took them to go! Throwing them babies in my over later for a snack!  Every single thing we are was ahhhhhhmazing!!!!! Topped off our meal with super delish deep fried Oreos! Omnomnom!!!!

Best hot dogs I've ever had, and the corn was seasoned to perfection. You can't be afraid to get a little messy because these hot dogs are definitely going to get your hands and face dirty with deliciousness.

I of course wanted to try everything there was.   Ordered the first 4 dogs on the menu, garlic fries and the horchata/churro dessert.  Verdict:  My favorite is the green dog. Chimichurri sauce is amazing. Red dog was spicy as f but then again, I don't often eat spicy foods. The traditional house dog was fabulous and my least favorite was the brown dog. The flavor didn't pop.   Garlic Fries - I prefer them nice and crispy. These are definitely not. And the garlic sauce that comes with it is okay. Maybe they need to chop the herbs in there a bit smaller.   The dessert came out looking all wrong. I guess they were having problems making the churro so first came the horchata ice cream and then then a really over done churro. Way over done. The ice cream tastes like a vanilla ice cream with bits of sprinkles. Have you ever tried the horchata at Taco y Taco? That's like Christmas in your mouth. That being said, the dessert was very disappointing.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying that I was referred to Dirt Dog by a good friend and fellow foodie from Chicago, so when the restaurant received his endorsement,  I was immediately intrigued.    My first question was could a dog shop, originally started in Los Angeles,  opening up doors in the desert of Las Vegas really be tgat good....Well, my friends, it is.   I of course read some fellow yelpers reviews before setting out. Many suggested the lobster bun and one review warned of long waits. When I pulled into the parking lot there were several people at the front door and I thought, dang, here comes the wait, at least I had mentally prepared. As I approached the door, the crowd moved away, and I realized they were standing there in food comas, not waiting to order.    Inside the business was clean and well lit, with a almost pub feel to it. There were several beers on tap. When I stepped up to order, I told the server it was my first visit and he immediately explained their simple, but delicious menu.   I order \"The Mutt\", which is not on the menu moard, but a combination of the red and the green. Spicey and full flavored. I also ordered the corn on the cobb, it comes street vendor style, very messy and with lots of flavor.  I ordered to go, and waited about ten minutes,  which I honestly did not think was bad, but when the server brought my order to me, he said they threw in one of their \"house\" dogs for my ling wait!   Needless to say, once I was home and the food was taste tested, it was a grade A hit. I highly recommend Dirt Dog for an early Sunday evening outing.",

I had seen advertisements and reviews that were good so what the heck. It was not the easiest to find in the shopping center, But I may have entered the wrong driveway. I walked in and went to the counter and I ordered the Dirty Chili Dog and the Dirty Corn as well as a drink. The Dog was wrapped in bacon and cooked perfectly covered in a semi spiced meaty chili. I can't say that I was wowed but I was impressed with the Dog. The wrapped in bacon part is a signature way they cook em. The Dirty corn was exactly what I was hoping for. Grilled corn topped with crema, cotija cheese, cilantro, bacon bits and chili powder. Served with slice of lime. The Menu describes it perfectly so might as well use theirs. Firm Crisp Corn with a sweat crema flavor and a bite of heat from chili powder. I opted to not use the lime, but one of the neighboring tables said that was the trick to it.  Thank you for dining  at Dirt Dog. I need to go here again and try the different varieties and take Josie for the corn. She would find it amazing. If in the area please go check it out. They have beer also by bottle and draft. I was going to a work meeting so I opted out of the adult beverage.",

    "text": "We finally made it in there, after learning of its existence a few weeks ago. My carnivorous teen was equally as excited about the asada fries as I was about the veggie dog, which was a plus. Also exciting was the fact that they had HPA on draft, which meant I got to finally try that too and YUM! The service, from the moment we entered, was great. The guy on the register was clearly new, but the girl helping him was super patient with him, as were we. As soon as I ordered my beer, she went to pour it while he entered the rest of the order. Another guy made a cute joke about me being under age, which will always earn points;) Between the 3 of us, we ordered 3 different hot dogs and fries and all of us we pleased w/our own orders...as well as each others'. Btw, the \"green\" style was surprisingly delicious! My only concern is actually for the servers/bussers. As efficient, friendly, on point as they were, I'm afraid their tip jar doesn't allow for them to be tipped as they deserve. Idk how they'd fix that, tho. We did tip as if we had a dedicated server, but most didn't and they certainly deserved it. Anyway, we didn't have dessert this time but do look forward to coming back to try more menu items soon. Worth the wait, and the drive!",

    "text": "IT IS DEFINITELY WORTH TRYING!!  My friend suggested we go here for lunch yesterday. I went into this with no real expectations. After all, she told me it was a hot dog restaurant. When we walked in, we were immediately greeted by staff. Though the menu is not extensive, there are several different options to choose from. I had the dirty chili dog, with garlic fries. They were both delicious. The only thing I could have asked for is, possibly, a spicier dog or chili. A little heat would have put that hot dog over the top. To cap off our lunch, we ordered the deep-fried Twinkie, Oreos and Churro. I had never had any of those. They, too, were delicious. When you think about a hot dog and fries, the prices are a little higher than what you would probably expect to pay. So, though it will not become a regular haunt for us, we will return occasionally for a hot dog, Twinkie and Oreo fix. Also, the music playing inside the restaurant was good. If I had an alcoholic beverage, I would have thought I was in a nightclub. They have added 3 more satisfied customers to their list.",

We love the artwork, music, and overall feel of it.  Akia at the register was wonderful!  She explained everything on the menu in detail and even gave a few recommendations.  It's only her third day working here, and I truly believe she could teach courses on customer service.  The kids loved their hotdogs and fries.  My son even ate all of his and most of mine!  (Again, I'm not a hotdog person.)  The only downsides were that there's mayo on the hotdogs, which wasn't listed on the menu.  There were also two menus next to the door that we didn't see: one for street tacos and taco fries.  Had we seen them, we might have ordered those instead.  We were so focused on the main menu on the wall, though, that we didn't see the other two menus behind us.  The food came out incredibly fast!  We were barely seated when the food came out hot & fresh.  After eating, we decided to order some of the goodies we initially missed.  We got a street taco (DELICIOUS) and the fried Oreos and a churro.  All were absolutely outstanding, piping hot and fresh!  We grownups will definitely come back for the street tacos and desserts, and the kids obviously loved their hotdogs.  The only tip I have is that if there are any foods that are off limits for you (like mayo) ask before ordering.  Not all ingredients are posted in the food descriptions.  Great place overall!!",

The Churro was by far the best and most try! It was crunch on the side and warm moist on the inside. The fries were crispy and perfect how I like it.

Mour only complaint. Our meals came out much sooner than the kids meal. So we waited to eat ours until she had hers and it was quite some time. Usually they make sure kids get there's first. Granted mini corn dogs sometimes take longer but they should make sure the items are all done at the same time or at least make sure kids meals come first . It was ok that the corn was done 20 minutes later .",

I was really tempted to order the fried oreos but I decided to save it for another day. The elote dog was good, but I was disappointed in the dirty corn, it looked like it would be bursting with flavor but instead it was bland. Maybe I just got a dud one, oh well I'll try again next time. The churro was decent, it just doesn't compare to Disney Land's churros, BUT the whip cream it came with was delicious.",

I've had several vegetarian/vegan hot dogs only to be let down by the flavor & texture, but Dirt Dog has figured the veggie dog out!  Friend #1 ordered a mutt dog while friend #2 tried a dirty chili dog. Loved it!  We all had a beer. We shared filthy fries, dirty corn & street tacos. Enjoyed all of it! No shortage of flavor.  The atmosphere is laid back. Cool artwork on the walls. Great place to enjoy beers & a bite to eat while listening to old school Hip-Hop.",

It was good not great. Had a trendy atmosphere but just to small of a space. In Vegas it's just too hot to cram so much into that small a place and all the body heat from the crowd just adds to it.  Would I go back ..maybe.... if a friend hasn't been there and wanted to go , but I wouldn't go on a Friday , weekend, or evening lol.   Check it out at-least once and if this is your jam more power to you.",

We've tried about half of the things on their menu so far but I keep coming back to a Green Dog on a lobster roll with sweet potato fries as my favorite. But we'll keep going back and trying other things to see if we can find more stuff that we like.   Parking: Ugh. If it's busy trying to find a place to park can be a pain. Getting back out on Rainbow if you want to go South is also a pain. But the friendly food and great service makes it worth the hassle. 4 Stars and no other complaints.",

This was the best decision. I was immediately greeted by Jada who was friendly and helpful and I decided on the Mutt Dog, and had Elote. I tried the churros for desert and it did not disappoint. Jada told me she can hold the order until I'm almost finished and Brian came by and asked if I was ready for my delightful churro. It was hot and tasty when he brought it to my table. I would highly suggest this place and location. Everyone was friendly.  The food was amazing. If I only had extra room in my tummy... Well I guess that means I have to return sooner than later!",

I am sorry for those who like this music but trying to talk over it and other people yelling to hear each other was a turn off of this place, I think next time I go I will get take out and go somewhere else to enjoy the food. The food was good and it was tasty, I got the Dirty Dog and the chili fries, they were good has some kick to them, but they have a lot of flavor and good quantity of food for the price. I will go back here but only as take out because the music is big issue, I don't want to eat while listening to cursing and other inappropriate things. I mean if they didn't have it blasting loudly maybe one could tune it out, we will see. I would say to try them they are different way to enjoy hot dogs.",

    "text": "Stopped by this spot for lunch since I was in the Blue Diamond area. A small little restaurant in the edge of a business complex just east of rainbow, it's bigger on the inside than it looks. Once you step in, you walk right up to the register and the menus are to your immediate right and to the left of the door. They have a photo for every menu item that gives you a visual of what you're ordering (might I add that the food really does come out like the photo). They play 90's hip-hop and R&B on the radio, and you can still hear yourself over the music. Three TV's are tuned to various sports and the artwork is all centered around, obviously, Los Angeles and its culture.  Since it's my first time here, I asked the cashier for reccomendations. She helped me decide on the Elote dog and Filthy fries.   I ordered the dog on Texas toast. The buttered bread holds the toppings on as well as it can (I see why they call it an extra dirty dog). The fries are made to order and came out extra crispy. The chipotle aioli sauce and semi-spicy guac gave it a great kick and still kept me from running to the fountain for a refill.  While these items were plenty to eat, I was curious about the street tacos and decided to try an Al Pastor and Vegan taco. A little underwhelming in size, but at such a low price point it's still worth it. I'm conflicted here. The vegan taco was good, tortillas were heated perfectly and the toppings were plentiful. Well executed. Now, on the other hand the al pastor taco was a bit disappointing. The meat was seasoned very well, but the tortilla was overcooked and too rough; I could not enjoy this taco as much as I'd hoped.  Despite a stale tortilla, overall experience was great, the employees were helpful and prompt in their service, plus managed to keep the place very clean. The food was well worth the price and the ambience was welcoming. I'll definitely be returning soon.",

Open now in the poppin' southwest area, Dirt Dog has a menu of bacon-wrapped street dogs, topped with peppers and onions and your choice of spreads and bun. Sides include street corn, dirty chips, garlic fries, and deep-fried desserts.   My pick is the classic house dog, on a lobster bun. My guy preferred the Green Dog with chimmichurri sauce and the Portuguese bun. The street corn was delicious, but we'll have to come back for the garlic fries. Deep-fried Oreos are served with a side of cinnamon frosting for dipping for a sweet ending to your meal.  Staff were super friendly and checked on us constantly. Location is clean with an industrial vibe. Signage is a little hard to see from the street, so just know it's in the same plaza as Pho Annie. Follow them on social media for discounts and event info- they have a beer tasting coming up next week!",

A big one is hot dogs, but I was going to take the high road and go. I am glad that I did because this place was awesome!   Service: The customer service was ridiculously good. The guy at the counter was very friendly. Forty minutes before closing, he still talked us through the menu. Even when we were eating he came to check on us and ask if we wanted dessert at 5 til close. You would have thought that we were there midday.   Food: I'm no hot dog expert, but I really loved the green dog. The churro with the horchata ice cream is one of the best I've had. The ice cream itself is outstanding. The tab selection has one of my favorites -- Xocoveza. (It's chocolate, coffee, vanilla, milk sugar, pepper, nutmeg, cinnamon to me. My favorite winter beer!) For my spicy lovers, this is an impressive hot sauce selection that actually has a kick. The dirty fries were fantastic with its cheddar bacon goodness.   Ambiance: I loved it. Clean, relaxed, and very L.A. I literally have nothing negative to say. For me, that is rare.",

    "text": "Lucky us! We decided to give Dirt Dogs a try last night and they were hosting a free tasting (whoop whoop!). Great way to try a few of their menu items so I know what to order on my next visit. Had the House, Brown, Green, Mutt (secret menu item) Dogs and the Dirty Corn. They also offered a Red Dog, but I was too full, lol.   The House Dog was my favorite. All the dogs are great tasting, quality ingredients, but the House Dog had all the right flavors and textures for my palette. The Green was also a hit for me. The Brown Dog had an Asian influence and the Mutt was just that...a \"mutt\" mixture of other dogs combined. Beware, it was really spicy! We skipped the Red Dog, but that too looked very spicy. The Dirty Corn was the highlight of the evening! Basically Mexican street corn, soooo good!  We also ordered Garlic Fries and Dirty Chips. Both were okay, the chips were slightly burnt for my taste and the fries didn't have a ton of flavor on its own. But the aioli dipping sauce that come with the Garlic Fries are a perfect complement and really elevated the flavor. My hubby tried the Deep Fried Twinkie which I wouldn't recommend - it was soaked in grease, perhaps cooked for too long, or at the wrong temperature.  The owner and chef spoke briefly during the tasting. The concept is street food style served in a sit down setting. They mentioned everything, down to the bacon bits, is house made.  All in all, hot dogs are excellent, highly recommend the Dirty Corn, but the other sides/dessert are just okay. Would definitely go back though!",

    "text": "Finally got to try this place out since I was in the area. I ordered a Mutt Dog and the Dirty Corn. The hot dog was super juicy and pretty tasty as well, although I did enjoy the Red Dog side more than the Green Dog. I loved the Portuguese roll and wish other hog dog places would use it as their bread as well! It was soft, chewy, slight crisp on the outside, and had just a hint of sweetness to balance out the saltiness of the hot dog. The line was also a nice touch since I added some of their extensive collection of hot sauces. They have so many types and it was definitely hard to choose! The one I pick was SUPER spicy though, and my mouth was on fire after a few drops. Fair warning to those who dare to try. The only complain I had about the Mutt Dog was the lack of toppings. I had a measly five or six slices of onion and I wish there were more.   For the Dirty Corn, I found it just okay. The corn was fresh and sweet, but there wasn't enough char. The few bites I had with the char were phenomenal and I just wish it was on the grill a bit longer. The toppings didn't taste very traditional to me, probably because of the lack of chili powder that I usually love to sprinkle generously on. The taste improved a lot with a spritz of lime.  My friend ordered a House Dog with an order of Garlic Fries, which she enjoyed. Overall I would give this place 4 out of 5 stars. The food was pretty tasty but would be greatly improved with more toppings. The ambiance was nice- kinda had a sports bar feel with a touch of urban and edgy. Something that also knocked down the rating was the weird storage area near the bathrooms in the back of the restaurant. It was a bit off putting to see and took away from the clean interior feel.",

To my surprise, Dirt Dog had no idea (cmon DD, market this day and fill up these empty seats!!!).    I love this place with a passion.  I have never experienced hot dogs prepared in this way before. They offer other ala cart items including Deep-Fried Twinkies, Dirty Corn, and assortment of fries. They offer alcohol if you wish. If you are looking for the ultimate comfort food, this is one of several places I recommend.   The restaurant is clean and tidy, you can tell that the owners spent extra time to the details in their craft.  From the wood flooring, brick wall design, artwork, and bar feel, I can see a diamond on the rough with this developing Rainbow area, and I hope that this restaurant grows.   Pros: quality Nathan's hot dogs, tasty food and flavor, quick customer service  Cons: not much customers even during lunch hour   This time next year, I expect a dancing Dirt Dog mascot, a live DJ, and bustling restaurant filled with hot dog enthusiasts willing to increase their cholesterol for one day.   Total 5/5 stars",

We are both pretty happy with a standard, good quality dog but none available on the menu...only 'creative' interpretations.  The best thing were the fries.  We had 2 types...garlic and salt & pepper and both were hot, crispy and fresh.  We each had a \"House Dog\" on a New England style bun.  Just way too much stuff on it and overdressed with sauce.  We shared a Cheetos crusted cob of corn (street style) and it was sub par at best.  And to top it off, 2 dogs, 2 orders of fries, 1 cob of corn and 1 regular Iced Tea cost just short of $30.00 (without tax and tip).  Needless to say, we won't return.  I would take 1/2 star off for the prices if I  could.",

It's the different aioli sauces that make these items legit. And if none of that is your food of choice, then their street tacos are amazing. The red salsa is a must with their guacamole. Definitely a place where ppl go to indulge, so bring your fat girl/boy appetite and be ready to grub. The environment and decor pays homage to iconic LA scenes and people, along with the music which is mostly west coast rap music - I dig it! Overall, a great place to get your cheat day fix and a really indulgent hot dog.",

Stood in line for 45 minutes watch the whole restaurant clear out the front door was held open the whole time so the inside of the restaurant became hotter to the point where I couldn't even sit and stay and enjoy my food and beer. I watched 4 other employees pace back and forth while a 2nd computer was available the whole time to clear the line that was out the front door and around the building. I watched as probably $1000.00 of business walked away after having to wait so long (based off my tab for 2 hot dogs, 2 fries, and a cold beer). Like I said the house dog and filthy fries I had and the dirty chili dog and fries my other half had were Really good, I have been looking forward to coming to this place since moving out here, but after watching this shit show take place, my beer getting hot , and not being able to finish or enjoy my food because the front door being open for over an hour and the restaurant heating up (mind you it's a cool 105 today) I'm very unhappy and dissatisfied. Again it's a shame I have to write this but the experience was one I had to write about",

The explosion of flavors you feel in your mouth is like nothing I can compare it to. I was so satisfied, I went up to order the corn and that was also mind blowing.  Also, the staff. I like those people. They're chill and the cashier greets you with, \"hey love\". I mean how cute? I would def. be back when I want to ruin my body. It's worth it. And when you're done it feels like the good kind of bloated, not the I wanna die bloated so that's a bonus.",

    "text": "The Dirt Dog hype is real! Their menu includes a variety of delicious gourmet dogs wrapped in bacon, tasty sides (dirty corn was fantastic), and house-made deep fried desserts.   So far, I've tried the both Mutt (spicy red and green dog combo on their secret menu) and the House Dog and can't wait to try the rest! Unfortunately, the kitchen was out of churros but substituted some fried Oreos on top of horchata ice cream and it was great. If a more traditional dog is your style, they are happy to accommodate for the picky eaters and kids.   A big plus for me had to be the craft beers available on draft, which included San Diego brews and local Vegas taps. Dirt Dog has a comfortable and bright dining area with booths and high top seating. Their west coast theme included a dope hip hop music playlist playing out the speakers and an urban city art motif reminiscent of the company's LA origins.   Can't wait to come back for the best dogs in town!",

The food looked delicious, and let me tell you....It tastes just as good as it looks. I had the mutt dog with elote and my SO had the dirt dog with garlic fries. My dog was a bit spicy, but the flavor packed a punch. And elote is always a weakness of mine so eating it here was a treat. The ranch that accompanies the fries is garlicky as well and we couldn't get enough of it. Topped the meal off with the horchata ice cream and we went home with more than happy stomachs. I would highly recommend this place for anyone that's in the mood for a quick, messy, yet tasty meal. We will be visiting again soon!",

And I mean FIRST CLASS haha. Totally unexpected. Jaden was working the register and she was a master of the menu. She made us feel like she was an advocate to our hot dog experience! Then there was Anisha who went out of her way knowing that we were checking out the map and she gave us cool little pins. We didn't even have to ask. Then Brian came up and cleared our table and checked in with us. The conversation went from the fried Oreos to a little on the history of Dirt Dog. Such a class act that guy is. Give these people a raise! Oh and the hot dogs were amazing haha. It was our first time and it's a 30 min drive but I TELL YOU WHAT. We'll be back number one because the customer service and number 2 because the food is solid. Thanks! Get a location in Northern Vegas! Aliante or centennial hills would be great",

We ordered the house dog, green dog, elote dog, S&P fries, churro, and the corn in a cup (apologies, forgot the name). Nothing was mouth-watering good. Also none of our dogs were bacon wrapped -all 3. When we told the lady she said that it would be hard to see if it was because of all the toppings on it but they were. I told her I actually removed the dog to feed my daughter and it absolutely was not. She was apologetic and offered a piece of bacon which I thought was funny and rude all at the same time. Plus bacon wrapped hot dog should be something that you could taste. I mean I know when I am eating bacon. It has such an overwhelmingly unique yet satisfying taste to it. So I guess check your dogs next time. Service was not bad and fast I will give them that. Enjoy!",

Bacon wrapped dogs with grilled onions and peppers.....where it gets good?  The bonus toppings!  House, green, red or brown.  I chose the Red Dog, upon ordering I was warned that it was spicy.  No lie there!  Spicy with a great flavor but certainly a lasting sting.  Paired with garlic fries complete with fried garlic it was a meal I would come back for.  Craft beers on tap, sweet!  I was able to sample the corn courtesy of my boyfriend and it puts street corn to shame!  Picture elote, just add bacon....bacon makes everything better, am I right??  And then the sweet, sweet finale to my meal....D-E-S-S-E-R-T! That's right, dessert!  Fried Twinkie and Oreos to be exact, paired with housemade horchata whipped cream and sprinkles, my inner fat kid was pleased.   If I didn't say enough about the food to have you venture to Dirt Dog, let me tell you about the staff and atmosphere.  The staff was friendly, offered a thorough detail of the menu, the back story of the restaurant and that was just when we walked in.  During our meal we were checked on by multiple staff members ensuring we enjoyed our meal.  There were suggestions for future visits on their favorite menu items as well.  The restaurant was clean and well kept, tables bussed and free of trash.  The 90's hip hop kept things nostalgic for me.  The only thing I would change, it was a smidge warm in the restaurant.  Not unbearable, but it wouldn't be pleasant for a sit down meal.",

Well, it turns out they are not.   I've tried every dog on the menu. My fav being the house Dog and the red dog(i love anything spicy).  All dogs are not created equal. I've been back 5 times. Diet out the window. The dogs are imaginative, delicious (cooked wrapped in bacon), and hearty (5/1).  I tried to even direct the different breads. Ex. Portuguese roll: I traditionally don't like. The texture, saltiness and taste left me nothing to complain about.  My favorite bread is the lobster roll. I think it's a must. Like driving in a Bentley. Its as good as it gets.",

Menu- Simple, easy to read menu w/ pictures as reference. Wish they had more variety of hot dogs though.   Service- Friendly. It's not really a restaurant style service. You just order when u walk in and sit down with your number & they bring you your food.   Ordered the House dog on Lobster roll & Red dog on Portuguese roll and asked for the chili flakes on the side because it looks overwhelming in the photos. The house dog had a little bit too much sauce for my liking but overall it was a good hot dog. The bread made it even better because it was a little buttery!   Sides- ordered the garlic fries that came with a garlic aioli. Wish there were more garlic on the fries though. The aioli was good. Very garlic-y   Really wanted to try the horchata ice cream & churro but I was tooooo stuffed! Next time.  I would definitely come back to try the other hot dogs because it's not that pricey & down the road from my house.",

Dirty Corn - Kind of disappointing, it looks super authentic and appetizing but it was very dry and the seasoning was not strong enough. I think if they added on cream or mayo rather than leaving it dry it would have had more flavor.  Horchata - Creamy frothy goodness and possibly the best in Vegas  Had a great time and would definitely go back again, staff was super nice and friendly. Needs more seating though",

Makes me feel like home. (We're from Denver, CO and we are so used to the urban cultures and local restaurants). Anyway, we shared the Al Pastor fries, dirty equite, the mutt dog and the chili dog. All were amazing and we were so full by the time we got done. We are going to have to go back again to try other stuff on the menu. I loved the mutt dog because it was wrapped in bacon. Delish!",

The first time we stopped in here was about a year or so ago for lunch with the kids. At that time they were kind of empty but the food was good! Yesterday we stopped in after my daughter's Volleyball game it was full but not annoyingly packed. I love the ambiance of this place, it very Cali-centric, with a huge graffiti mural and Pac playing in the background. But the food.. OOOHH let me tell you about the food! I had the house dog, which is their simplest of the dogs, but this thing was loaded. First off, all their dogs are wrapped in bacon, and served with sauteed onions and bell pepper. The house dog also has mayo mustard and ketchup. All the things I never knew I looveddd on a hot dog. It was really good. My only complaint- it was a little creamy with mayo and the onions and pepper being sauteed in a thousand island based sauce, next time I will do extre mustard or pickles or something to cut mayo. We shared the garlic fries which were extra garlic-y, which I loved. Skip these if you don't want to breath fire well after your meal. Hubby got a Dirty Chili Dog which looks amazing. Daughter got the Dirty Esquite, which is just Elotes in a cup, son got the mini corn dog kids meal. Which came with 2 Oreos and a cinnamon cream dipping sauce. Somewhere along the way, he decided the cinnamon cream was actually for his French fries.. . Great little lunch or dinner spot. If you live in the Southwest/Mountains Edge area and want something different than the chain spots, then you won't be disappointed!",

She provided kind and bubbly service as talked about Pokemon Go and the menu, of course. She was able to help us with all of our questions.   My boyfriend got the House Dog and a side of garlic fries.  House Dog w/ Lobster-style bread: Seemed like a normal hot dog, nothing too fancy.  Garlic Fries: He would get it again. I personally expected more, could skip.   My sister and I shared the Green Dog w/ Lobster-style bread and the Dirty Esquite (I call it the dirty corn in a cup). Green Dog: Very refreshing and light. The bread was toasty AND buttery.. the perfect combination.  Dirty Esquite: A street corn lover's dream. My sister has braces, so this was very convenient for her. The bacon added a nice crunch but would love more added into it!  Last but not least, you can't skip on dessert. \"Food is for the stomach; dessert is for the soul.\"  Horchata Ice Cream: For the price, there is a generous amount of pleasure in every bite. The horchata ice cream had a smooth, cinnamon flavor, along with Rice Krispie bits and some nuts (is available without nuts as well). The crunch definitely added to its consistency. With the churro on top, this dessert will definitely satisfy your sweet tooth.   Although there are some things that we would skip out on, we are looking forward to trying the rest of the menu and returning soon.",

What's more, I especially don't eat them out, because I tend to want more elaborate foods when I eat out or fancier ambiance than at home. However, Dirt Dog is a place where i actually am OK going to eat a hotdog. The decor is pretty welcoming for a casual place. Friendly staff. Delicious food! My favorite is probably the red dog, but really, I feel like you can't go wrong with whatever dog you choose. The elote is delicious as well!",

It's very clean everytime I come in and the staff is always very friendly and welcoming.    Menu The menu is small so easy to pick from. Four different hot dog flavors to choose from plus a veggie option. Three different bun choices from. There are 6 different sides and four dessert options.  Food The hot dogs are phenomenal!! I've had the green, red, and house so far. They have amazing flavors and the Portuguese bun is so yummy!  The red dog was very good and very spicy! I loved it.  I've had the dirty chips and the seasalt and pepper fries and both are to die for. The flavors used are so addicting!! I haven't had the desserts yet but it's definitely in the near future.  If your looking for something delicious to eat, look no further then dirt dog!!",

We ordered the House Dog, the Mutt Dog, The Chili Dog, filthy fries and the elote corn cup. My favorite was the house Dog with red and green peppers, onions and bacon thousand island. It was superb! We ordered the mutt dog because we couldn't decide between the red or green dog. Next time I will pick one or the other because the clash of flavors was a little much for the palate. Just enough spice. The chili dog was good but not what I was expecting. This place over does it a bit on the cilantro and bacon, but that's just my opinion. I would order it again just cheese onions and chili. The fries were delicious. Crispy fried and they didn't get soggy with all the condiments on top. I was surprised how spicy they were. The corn cup was good but again, I would do without the cilantro and bacon. No room for desert but I would love to try the horchata ice cream mmm. Would definitely recommend Dirt Dog!",

I walked out feeling like I needed to bust a cap or pick up so ho-ho's to get some street cred  Now to the food. It was most delicious.. I highly recommend the #1.. Thing was so dang good I would def come back just for that. The food is really good!!  Just know your crowd with the music... I would of given the place 5 stars but I'm going off the total ambiance.

Great music, fun vibe, my sons and I loved the games while we were waiting for our food! The food itself tasted great! All three of us loved it! Soooo.... this was our first time visiting. We took a minute to go over the menu, this seemed to immediately set a tone of annoyance with the girl at the counter. We did step aside so others (there weren't any) could order. When we finally decided my sons ordered first. With the first selection she asked what type of bun, my son asked what his options were, annoyed she recited them. Second son orders and again asks bun choices as he hadn't heard her. She is even more annoyed. I place my order and hand my card over to pay. She swipes it and literally flings it on the counter. Okay.... so, the same girl brings out our order of fries wayyyyyyy before the food arrives and simply drops them on the table. As for the dogs we ordered two house dogs and one ranchero. Again, they tasted great. Only the two house dogs were so different from one another they didn't even look like the same dog. One was clearly loaded up and the other had been skimped on. Why the inconsistency? I left feeling sad, and really don't know that I'll return.",

I highly recommend this place and will definitely be back!!",

    "text": "\"When I was.. a young boy, my father.. took me into the city, to see the\" dirtyyyy dog. Going to LA is one of my favorite experiences: relaxing at night on the beaches, trying all the great food, and indulging in the California lifestyle. One visit at the flea markets is when I first had the California dirty dogs. A mexican creation of a bacon wrapped hot dog topped with crema, avocados, and onions is what make childhood memories great. Hearing that we were having an establishment named after this delicious treat, makes me utter a phrase I thought I'd never say, \"I need some of that weiner!\"  Setting: Incredibly difficult to find, and placed in a terrible location. From blue diamond, it is the first plaza on the right where the bar and the pho place is. From 215 the last plaza on the right before you reach blue diamond.   Interior: Huge, and very open with tvs posted throughout the space.  Service: There was 2 parties in the restaurant and it took about 20 minutes for my food to come out. I mean for a hotdog and a corn on a stick you'd think they'd come out much sooner than that.  Food: I got the house dog and the loaded elote. Elote: super weak, it pretty much is just a normal piece of corn, decorated with flavorless ingredients and really disappointed me. The House dog was ok and the topping added it to it made it all taste the same rather than having each ingredient stand out.  Overall: I won't be coming back here, I hear steamie weenie has a jalapeno jelly hotdog with other fixins that I'm going to check out next.",

It always is. It's always worth the wait in line, which always goes surprisingly fast. We always find seating pretty easily, too! I've had a few different dogs, but once I had the elote, I have not been able to deviate. Before, I've always enjoyed the green or the mutt. I've been meaning to try the chili dog...someday. The service is always fantastic, especially for an at the counter restaurant. Seriously, they're the best. Everyone seems happy, helpful, and wanting to make your experience the best. Also, they always blast 90's era west coast rap. If that's not your thing, then I don't know what to say, because it rules!!!",

After finishing a training session, I came straight here to refuel. Simple menu, friendly staff, and orders come out pretty quick. I got the house dog and garlic fries.  The house dog was probably one of the best hot dogs I have been blessed to try. Nice and meaty hot dog on a delicious toaster bun with bacon, green chili, thousand island dressing, and grilled onions. Some of my favorite hot dogs were just ketchup, mustard, and crushed potato chips, so this is a good departure from that.  The garlic fries were good. I was expecting more garlic, as it was more like regular fries for me. I would probably try another topping next time.  Overall, I really enjoyed the hot dog and will be back for more.",

I asked the worker (Austin) for a recommendation and he said the elote dog.  I went with that, and I wasn't disappointed.  Nice mix of sweet, citrus, and textures.  Bread was good, not a typical hot dog bun.    We also tried the fried Twinkie and the garlic fries.  The spicy ketchup is good, nothing too crazy, just ketchup with a bit of a kick and heat at the end.   Coolest thing was, he didn't rush us out or wasn't in a hurry. Great customer service.",

We had noticed a booth that had an extra portion of a booth to keep our kid from escaping while we all ate. So we asked if we could sit in that booth that yes had to be wiped down in order to be used. He told us with attitude that there was another table that was clean and to just sit there. We explained to him about the keeping the kid in a confined area while we ate and he didn't want to hear it and continued to say to go sit elsewhere. We refused and waited for him just to wipe it and nothing else. He gave attitude the whole time and as we thanked him for doing that he just walked away and said nothing. This was our first time eating at this restaurant and it was our last not a fun experience at all. We even asked if he was a manager of some sort and was told no he's just a worker and always has an attitude and that coworkers don't like to work with him. Just before we were finished eating the guy that was giving us attitude came over to our table and explained that he wasn't being rude or giving attitude and never gave an apology and continued to defend himself while giving more attitude. I was completely shocked and surprised he came over and not the manager. With the amount of local specialty food restaurants around the area I'd like to think that each and every encounter with a customer that you guys would and will be having would make that person want to come back and tell his or her friends about you and the wonderful food but the service from one person can ruin it forever. Thanks for one great meal but that's all it's going to be. One. Oh btw the guys name is Jacob.",

I'm a pretty plain person so I had to ask if they'd do a plain dog on the Texas toast and I thought that was great. But my friend got one with chili, bacon, and cheese on Texas toast. The cheese tasted like it was a powder mix cheese instead of melted cheddar. So she wasn't to crazy about that. But she really liked the Flaming Corn on a stick! Mixed with hot Cheetos and again the same cheese. I got the Galic Fries and they were delicious. Then we couldn't pass up trying the churro. It was good, tasted like an average churro but the side sauce it came with was good.   We went on a Monday night and had to wait about 15 minutes to order. We weren't in a hurry so it wasn't a problem.  They also have beer which is pretty cool!   Overall cool place. Wish it was a little closer to where I lived.",

The atmosphere is a very underground hip-hop street food kind of place   We ordered the Flaming Dog (with the habanero sauce on the side because I'm not very good with spicy food), the Dirty Chili Dog with the lobster bun, the Dirty Corn, and the Horchata Ice Cream as our dessert.  Let me start by saying that the food came out surprisingly quick! We got it in about 3-5 minutes and it was delivered to us by the woman who took our order. The flaming dog was covered with a red powder which mountains the hot dog. To be quite honest, it was not easy to eat. It was hard to approach the  dog because of how much topping it had but luckily we had the option of cutting it in half.  The Dirty Chili Dog was very delicious, however the texture was what kind of brought the rating down for me. It was really the chili topping itself was tasty but very soggy. Napkins became a must to keep our hands clean but that didn't stop us from digging in!   I had high hopes for the Dirty corn but it's quite incomparable to the regular street vendor elite man. My girlfriend wasn't too appealed with it but  I generally enjoyed it. The ice cream was a definite surprise for us, it's sprinkled with a cinnamon powder and came with a churro!   Overall the service was quite remarkable. Priscilla was the person who took our order. She welcomed us in and asked us if it was our first time. She then went through a thorough explanation of the menu and convinced us to order what we ordered. We sat ourselves and the table was already kinda dirty because of the previous diners. We wiped it ourselves and waited for our food.",

It's a place where you can order gourmet hot dogs and wonderful corn filled with other ingredients like Elote to make a wonderful combination.  They play hip hop song with fits the theme since you see a picture of Tupac near cashier which sets the style of music they play.  It's a nice place to get your craving for delicious hot dogs with delicious desserts like Horchata Ice Cream and Churro.  Highly recommend these place! I ordered The House Dog and The Green Dog, both have a delicious flavor!",

I had an elote dog, which was so different but delicious. I also had a house dog which was a pretty damn good basic hot dog. They serve the dogs in lobster rolls which is so genius because they hold the dog and topping better than a regular bun and they taste great. I had their al pastor fries and those were also so good. I have to go back to try the churro with horchata ice cream. I was way too full last time but I am definitely going back. This place does get pretty packed thought. When I arrived there weren't very many tables open, and by the time I had finished ordering there was a line behind me almost out the door.",

The menu has expanded, and there's some really delicious dogs and even tacos now! Who ever decided to add the tacos was right on the money.   I was here for lunch and the place was packed with a like out the door the entire time. I wasn't too sure about the place last time I came, but i'm glad I came back.

One of the best parts besides the food was the 90's rap they play. The interior is interesting and there's plenty of art to look at. I can't wait to go back and gain 3 more pounds eating these amazing dogs. Oh and the staff is super friendly. Really don't have one bad thing to say about this place. Not sure why I haven't been back in over a month... think maybe we will go for lunch today lolol",

Located in a small strip center this place is unassuming from the front.  Easy to read menu boards and friendly staff.  Hubby and I ordered two dogs and a churro.... Finished them and had to order one more dog to share. The hot dogs are juicy and bacon wrapped and a very decent size dog.  The toppings were just enough that they had little falling of but enough that you got toppings in each bite.  You get to choose your bun, they come with a few set toppings (customizable..ex: no green bell pepper) and then extras that make each dog unique. Definitely worth checking this place out. They play good music too!",

Wanted to order the veggie dog which is on their site and when they said they don't have it they proceeded to ask me if I wanted a beef one instead. I'm pretty sure if your asking for a veggie dog, you most likely don't eat beef!",

We had the Green Dog, The Dirty Chili Dog, and a plain bacon wrapped hot dog (for my 6 year old) The Filthy Fries, two Dirty Corns and one Dirty Esquite. All that and not one complaint!! The flavors were amazing. Not only was the food outstanding the service was also impeccable. The lady at the register (who happens to be one of the owners) was incredibly helpful and explained all the items, as well as suggesting their popular items. This place was so good that if they didn't have one in LA I'd be super bummed! But knowing I can have this whenever I want once I'm back in LA makes me do a little happy food dance!!",

    "text": "A pretty decent place! Been there twice. First time by myself, second time brought a friend. The food definitely tastes good, but the portions are small, if you get just one hot dog, you'll leave hungry. A couple things I have to mention about this place that made it into 4 star instead of 5.  First of all, there is no menu at the table, the setup is more like McDonald's. But the problem is that people are very indecisive. It makes the wait extremely long, for example, last night, I had to wait about 15 minutes for just 2 people in front of me to order.. They were standing there, looking at the menu and couldn't decide what they wanted. This could be easily solved if there were either more cashiers (instead of just one), or even better, let people sit at a table and give them a menu so they can sit there as long as they want until they decide. This way others won't have to wait so long. Second thing is the restroom. The place can get pretty busy, the place serves beer and plays music. This means that people might want to stick around a little longer, but the restroom is only for one person at a time. This can get very uncomfortable. You have to wait even if you just want to go wash your hands. Otherwise it's a very nice place, cozy set up. Food doesn't take too long to prepare. I recommend",

Others tried the street tacos, the house dog and the several different dog names ( I can't remember them all) and the dirty fries. So many choices! We were too stuffed to try the dessert but maybe next time.The place was really crowded, lines out the door for the whole 2 hours we were there. They have a real small area to wait in line so even 10 people will fill it up. Had people cleaning tables constantly. The service was great. A waitress came and gave us silverware, water and extra napkins after I secured a few tables for our group even though they had not arrived yet! I would go again. I love the lobster rolls instead of hot dog buns. Just ups the taste a little. Lots of spice but not too much on most items. Great place and I understand they are opening 3 more spots. Must see where they will be. Only negative for me was the LOUD LOUD music. Music was rap but could have toned the volumn down a bit.",

We also got seasoned garlic fry's they where excellent.  Place was clean and friendly.  Liked it so much we came back on Monday 6th March.  We only got the Corn and green dogs with garlic fry's.  I will say still clean and friendly BUT food not even the same.  The dirty corn tasted good but not as good as Sat.  I came back specifically for the garlic fry's.  They where not seasoned, under cooked and raw garlic in a pile on top.  Now that said if that is how they normally are served then my bad.  The person who was cooking on Saturday around 3-4 ish  really knows how to cook and make people come back for more.  Consistency is the key and there was none in the food department.",

We tried the Dirty Fries and they could of used more chili and cheese and they were a bit on the salty side but, taste great! The hot dogs are delicious. I also ordered the Corn Mesquite and was a bit unsatisfied, the cup was literally filled half way, flavor was great though.....but for the price they could have filled the cup (just like pictured on the menu and what you see on IG). Place itself is nice, clean and spacious. Prices could be either lower or portions could be a bit more fuller/bigger.   All aside, great place and great flavors!",

The second time around the onions were grilled but the fries on the dog were ice cold. At that point I asked for the manager. However, she was too busy messing with the TV. We waited over 5 minutes for her to come over so we just got up and demanded a refund. Also both dogs were the exact same, yet looked completely different. Don't waste your time going here.",

It ended up making the two vegan tacos I ordered taste like they had actual chili in them. The corn in the cup was flavorless as well, and also tasted like chili. My fiance even said it when he tried it. He got the chili dog and said it wasn't good at all: there was no flavor at all. Everything was good quality and homemade BUT NO FLAVOR OR SPICE.   Although the atmosphere was nice (they played modern music and had board games to play), you go to a restaurant to eat and the food is not worth it and outweighs anything good about Dirt Dog. I'm sad, and the pictures looked so good. What a let down.",

This is my first time in this business and it will certainly be my last!!!  Just finished the hotdog and fries. And yep not worth it. The roll was dry and the dog seemed over cooked.

The dog I had was wrapped in bacon and topped with elote which I didn't expect to like but damn the combination of flavors tasted great. The dog was big and had nice flavor and the bun was slightly grilled in butter. I didn't care much for the al pastor tacos but the chicken tinga and asada were bomb af. The tinga was spicy and the flavors were good but the asada was the real winner for me I\"ll be back to plow through many more of those. The carne adasa nachos didn't last long at our table everybody really liked them the chips tasted so good. They serve beer here but I recommend the horchata. I wish I had room for some of the fried oreos but I'll have to save room next time.",

The dog was a bit dry for my taste and the fries was meh. I didn't think there was anything special for this place. The best thing of the place is the toast (lobster style). You must specify for that if you wanted that instead of the regular bun. As for the price, it seems fair (about $6.75) for each regular dog. It's worth a try but I've tasted better hot dog.",

My dad and I took a little Vegas vacay and this was seriously the highlight of the trip. We happened to be off the strip and in looking for a lunch spot and this popped up. They had me at bacon hot dogs, because they're absolutely magical. Anyone who disagrees hates puppies, babies, and rainbows. I had the elote dog and the dirty fries. I almost cried tears of joy if the dessert didn't dry them instantaneously. Dad still talks about it to this day. Anytime we sit down to eat he sighs and says, \"how good would a dirt dog be right now.\" and looks at his food so forlornly it's almost sad.  Thanks dirt dog.  I think you broke my dad. Lol.",

Hot dog was crisp when you bit into it which I liked but I never tasted nor saw any cheese.  Hubs got the chimmichurry and avocado dog. He did not finish it... just was not good... we also had the garlic fries, which we normally love but, not these... Way too much garlic and we love garlic!

Not a huge deal, I understand mistakes happen, but I decided to just drive back across town and get a refund.   They refused to give me a refund and said they'd just remake the food. I said no, so they brought over two more employees to verify what had collapsed on their end and once again they told me that they'd really just like to remake the food.   So, if you want a refund, you'll need to raise your voice, and if you want them to understand what the problem was, you'll need to wait eternity and look over everything four times because they still won't understand and they'll still say they'd feel more comfortable just remaking your food.",

However the downfall to my visit was the dear busboy,cashierJACOB. We had wanted a booth table that would accommodate and keep my 2 year old wrangled in. Unfortunatly the table was dirty so we were willing to wait for it to be cleaned. JACOB offered us another table but we explained why we preffered this table instead. WELL  that's when inconvianaced Jacob decided to huff and let it be known with his body language that we were making his job difficult with our request. When Thanking him he walked off as being dismissed from American Idol.. We did complain to the young kid who had originally taken our order. He made several apologies for Jacob's behavior. Even went as far to offer coupons and a free dessert. I denied them because I felt that this wasnt this young man's fault. WELL I guess then somehow word got back to Jacob  because he came back to our table to apologize but it really wasnt an apology. It was more defending himself , telling us how we read him wrong. I call it a half ass attempt at taking responsibility that maybe he was having a bad day..All  I know is it didnt leave me feeling happy.  I couldn't wait to get the hell out of there and not be in his presence.. If it wasnt for that expierance I'd say it was the perfect visit..",

I don't even like hot dogs but I have been wanting to return to Dirt Dog since trying it couple of weeks ago. I had the Patty Melt Dog, Garlic Fries, Dirty Corn, and a Churro. All were freaking good! It was a bit too much food for me but I was feeling greedy and wanted to try everything... Even aside from the toppings and the lobster roll bread and all the toppings, the bacon wrapped hot dog is the best I've ever had. This is the first time in my life, I am craving a hot dog!  The garlic fries is worth to crave as well. Not your typical garlic fries, it's fried to perfection and tossed in garlic oil (made in-house!). The restaurant seemed quite busy, with a steady flow of customers. There are tables and bar seating available. The restaurant also serves beer - perfect partner to a hot dog.",

I didn't mind sitting on the high chair and also I got a peek of who's working in the kitchen too!.

I liked the 4 hotdogs that we had (house dog, red dog, green dog and patty melt dog) but that was it. I was expecting a huge party in my mouth with tons of flavors but I missed the party.   Tupac was playing when I walked in and I felt like I was home, then I saw the board games and thought my 3 year old would have fun here. I got home with my to go order, ate and now I feel jipped.   The house dog had a ton of mayo on it which ruined it for me personally but it should be Great for you mayo lovers. The only thing I tasted on the patty melt was the fries. The red dog had the most flavor but was a little weird for me. The green dog was my fave but I needed more toppings, I was left with a handful of bread at the end. Speaking of bread; I tried all three options and everything was good but I'm not sure what the \"lobster\" in lobster bread was all about. Tasted like Texas toast to me. The only thing that knocked our socks off was the cashier who took my phone order and gave me my order, she was nice, and dessert. We really enjoyed the fried Twinkie, churros and Horchata ice cream.   I feel like I cant be the only person to not love this place so I'm going to go back and try some other items on the menu even though the bf doesn't want to go back. I was disappointed to find there are several more items on the menu in the restaurant than there were on the dirt dog website menu. I would have been all over some carne asada fries and maybe even the corn with the hot Cheetos!",

The dog itself it freaking delicious- doesn't matter what topping you might choose, the meat itself was not too greasy or fatty and has a great flavor.  We had the chili and it was NICE! I wasn't as impressed with the cheese sauce, it was a little gritty.  The corn on the cob was covered in a ton of cheese, and while that isn't my preference, some might live that. The corn itself was cooked very well (not chewy or over done)",

One thing to point out, they also serve delicious tacos! However, you would never know because the menu board with the tacos is located behind you and not next to the hot dog menu.   The food arrives pretty quickly.  The place is very clean too.  You not want to bring your kids here because the music they are playing is mostly from Tu-Pac (RIP) and his lyrics are a little raunchy.  I hope this place keeps up the good work. I'll keep returning if they do!",

Just standard, not great, hot dogs. The toppings actually made them worse, in my opinion. Even the fries were subpar... How do you mess up fries with garlic on them. I've had dozens of varieties of garlic fries and have never once had to complain about them. Sorry, but I just can't recommend this place. Would rather grill up my own dogs and have them plain as can be...plus save $20",

The food was amazing, it's the best part of experience and something I cannot get anywhere else. The fries were so good, they were very generous with the portions and had a lot of toppings on the carne asada fries. The hot dogs are what they're known for and they did not disappoint at all. The dog was so soft and had so much flavor to it while the toppings made the hot dog so unique. I would for sure come back to try different items on the menu.",

When I landed in LV I immediately saw an ad for Dirt Dog in my feed. What?? Weird. Anyway, I'm glad it happened. This place is awesome.   The dogs are so unique and even the desserts looked unique and tempting.   Ended up getting the carne asada tacos, garlic fries, and chili dog.   The tacos were good and were authentic style. No complaints.  They were full of flavor and the lime brought out the seasonings.   The chili dog was awesome. Full of toppings and the bun choice (lobster roll) was perfect. It was spicy but not too spicy. Could have gotten two of these easily.   Lastly, the garlic fries. They were good and flavorful with real minced garlic on top. The issue is they were sopping and sitting in a huge puddle of oil. Half of them weren't even edible.   Te service was great and everyone was friendly, professional and had a big smile.  I believe it was the manager who was out speaking to customers and clearing tables. She seems to really love her job and care about each customer. I believe her name starts with a B. She is stellar.",

The loaded fries are crazy delicious and the quality of those bacon wrapped dogs are great. Dirt Dog also has street tacos which are also delicious, strait up from LA!  Dirt Dog is located on Rainbow close to all the food action in the Enterprise area of Vegas. It is definitely worth the trip to eat dirty!",

    "text": "Whenever we're in the mood for an over the top hotdog, we go here.  We've tried almost every dog that they offer and they are all so good.  The hotdogs itself are juicy and the toppings just make it even better.  I highly recommend getting it in the lobster roll.  The soft buttery of it makes it 10 times better.  Oh and here's a tip - make sure to have a napkin close by cause it can get pretty messy.    The restaurant itself has a nice hip hop feel to it with hip hop music playing in the background.  They have murals all around including Tupac and Ice Cube.  Our favorite though is the City of Angels on the back wall.  It just gives it a nice socal homie feel.    Now, be prepared it can get pretty busy here.  The last couple times the line was out the door.  Its so busy sometimes that finding a table to enjoy your meal can be difficult.  If you have a big party, also be prepared to sit separately.  The first time we came we had to sit in two different tables cause there wasn't a big enough table to hold all of us.  Since we have a huge party most of the time, we like to sit down on a table to make sure that we have a table.  Unfortunately, you cannot do that here since there is a big sign that says no saving tables until you have your order number.   It was my husband's first visit the last time we came here and he loved it.  He says it reminds him of Pinks. I can't say I agree with him since I've only been there once.  That's pretty sad to say out loud considering I'm a socal native **don't judge me** . But yea, they don't only serve dogs, but elotes, fries, tacos, and fried desserts.  We still haven't tried their fried twinkies and/or oreos but plan to someday.  Overall the service, wait, and food was great.  Will definitely be back.",

The menu offers quite a variety of over the top hot dogs and French fries. I had the chili cheese dog and oh.em.gee was it delicious. The Texas toast is a must for a bun. I love that there are so many options and everything is different. The service was great, everyone was continuously asking if we needed help or if we had everything. I also tried the churro with horchata whipped cream and I highly suggest because it's amazing!   This is a place I will be returning to and anyone wanting to try it should stop in immediately!",

We are basic, and got a basic hot dog with ketchup, mustard and onions. The bun was delish and fresh with a yummy crisp to it. The hot dog itself was very filling.  The fries, garlic fries were yummy! Brought back memories of eating them at Dodger Stadium.  Lastly we tried the fried Oreos, which paired with the cream sauce was to die for.  All in all, a great experience. The atmosphere feels like your walking the streets of LA and the service is great. If you're looking for a new try, this is a great Vegas find!",

When I saw that there was a pho restaurant next door, I was ok. If the dogs did not work, can always go next door.   Located in the same plaza as The Lodge on Rainbow and Windmill, there is plenty of parking. Greeted with 6 screens of menus when we walked in, we definitely did not know what we were getting in to. Dirty dog, flaming dog, red dog, and mutt dogs, oh my. What is going on with these names? The atmosphere is dope. An indoor street feel with BEER. The music brought me back to my B-Boy days. As I'm writing this Planet Rock by Africabamba is playing. About to bust on the floor here. Oh, that's breakdancing for you millennials. Customer service here is very friendly and suggestive, if you just so not know what to get. Like me.  What ordered: Pastrami dog  Elote dog DUI fries Flaming corn  Obviously if your reading more, I stayed. Yup, I am now a fan of hot dogs. As long as it's smothered in pastrami, MJ cheese, bacon bits, sweet pepper, and pickles. 1 bite and that was it. As you can see in the pictures, I am happy. So if your ur in the NW, North, East side or wherever part of town and would like an out the ballpark dog, stop by.",

    "text": "It has been a few months since I've been here (I think around January and I remember because it was winter break for me). The last time I went here, it was FANTASTIC and UNIQUE. I'm going to go in depth, the end I will have a pro and con list if you really just want to skip over.  So, I went here and I walk in and the line is FILLED with people. I mean FILLED. We were barely at the entrance. I'm a very patient and excited person, so I didn't mind the wait at all. It was all worth the hype after all!  Food 5/5:  I ordered a normal Hot Dog and Carne Asada Fries. The quality of the food was super duper good. It was fresh and hot straight off the grill. I'm not really a huge fan of hotdogs, but I ate most of it anyways! It was really good. My favorite thing in the restaurant was actually the Carne Asada Fries. If there is anything I love to combine, its definitely Carne Asada and Fries. Dirt Dog just happened to perfectionize the food! It was just perfect, there is no other word to describe. Fries were crisp, the carne was perfectly juicy, the sauces and veggies were fresh, etc.   Customer Service 5/5: Like I said before, the place was very busy. There was a huge line, from the front of the cashier all the way to the door (Which isn't far apart from each other, but trust me when I say there was a lot of people). When my family & I got up to the cashier, they were very kind and took their time when it came to taking orders (We were quick anyways, since we had a lot of time to decide what we wanted from the menu, so its fine). The Employees were great, they're great chill people and I love that.   Atmosphere 5/5: I absolutely LOVE the atmosphere. They have a cool map where people outside of Vegas can pin where they came from (As in if you're from Austin, Texas, you would be able to put a small little baby flag pin with your initials if you really wanted to!). They also have a lot of good, original art that I'm sure has supported local artists (Which I absolutely adore because I, myself, am an artist and I love/am very passionate about local art). The music was old school hip hop and stuff. The style and everything about the place is just unique, different, and awesome. It's just filled with positive, chill energy. I loved it so much. It kind of felt like home away from home in a way. I wish more restaurants were more like this location. Instead of trying to be fancy and snazzy, they should be more authentic (like this place).   Pros -Wonderful food you're going to fall in love with -Good & nice employees -Creative and authentic style  -Good & Local art -Good old school music playing  Cons -Not really any, but if you're inpatient or have anxiety when it comes to being around a lot of people, I wouldn't come during busy hours  Things to consider -If you do not like Hip styled places, I do not recommend coming here (I know some older folks that do not like 'Hip, Youthful' styled places) -If you are inpatient and cannot handle waiting 10 minutes (to order), I wouldn't come during busy hours  -If you have anxiety being around a lot of people, I wouldn't come during busy hours either",

The tacos here are fantastic, I had the Al pastor and asada. The tortillas we're perfectly made. Then the elote... Which is called esquite or something when it's cut up and in a cup. It was good but could have used more mayo and butter. The veggie dog was a bit dry, but the pastrami dog rocked my world. Soooooo juicy! Get it with a lobster bun to experience perfection.   For dessert, we had horchata and a churro nothing that really stood out, I've had better, and I've had worse, but i came here for the dogs and I wasn't disappointed.",

Price might be a little high but the food is better than avg. so I don't have an issue with it. They play a lot of hip hop and hardcore rap classics. They have a few TVs and some board/table games.  The price isn't a point of contention. It could be better but that's not a big deal. The occasional congestion at the door and order counter is more concerning. Would also like to see a relatively healthy option or two that's as creative as some of your not-so-healthy options.  4/5 because of price for value and the ordering at register creates congestion at the main entry.

    "text": "Update: Dirt Dog reached out to my husband and me and asked for another chance, and we're so glad we did! We got the Elote Dog, Dirty Esquite, Dirty Corn, and Flaming Corn.   The Elote Dog was amazing! It has a cheesy base topped with a juicy dog smothered in sauced corn and bacon bits. Very rich and satisfying. The Dirty Corn is lightly grilled after steaming so it's got more complexity than standard street corn, a crisp bite and juicy sweetness that marries the salty, crunchy, savory bacon bits. The Dirty Esquite is the Dirty Corn in a cup so it's a perfect flavorful, to-go snack! The Flaming Corn is definitely hot when you eat the whole thing, so I was happy to have other items to eat with it.   The staff was outstanding, as usual. Every part of this meal was delicious! I recommend every item, and this meal more than redeemed our previous experiences. We will be back!!  - - - It was just ok. We went there just to try their corn, and they've been out both times we've gone. I had the green dog and my husband had the house dog. The house dog was better tasting, but they were both really dry. It looks nice when it comes to you, but the sauce is more decorative and soaks into the bun so fast that a few bites in, it just tastes like a dry hotdog with an occasional onion. The people behind the counter were very nice both times, though. N",

I was not a fan of their cheese sauce - was grainy - and everything else was kinda something I could have done on my own at home.

It was good, to me it wasn't anything too special. Just a basic good hot dog.   My husband got the green dog and that one was good! I love the guac and lime in it. Definitely different from what I've had before. We got garlic fries which were good too.  Best thing about this place is their elote! Oh man it was amazing. They grill their corn, it was so juicy and good. As good as your elote man for sure! Definitely would come back for the hot dogs and elote. My husbands new favorite place!",

Honestly i've only been to two different hotdog spots like this and I highly approve of the idea. This brings eating hotdogs to a whole new level.   I fell in love with the vibe as soon as I entered. They were bumping Pac in the back and had memorabilia of his genius. This is place is pretty lit and not too hard on the eyes.  So we ordered the Elote dog and some #Filthyfries. Both were amazing. They even gave us an extra ranchero dog on the side and man. I really appreciate that gesture because that one was my favorite. Be expecting me to head over again but don't get me wrong. I love the old Cheeburger Cheeburger spot however Dirt Dog became my new love. I'll be back to try the other dogs and fries.   Food is an adventure am I right?",

A little hard to eat because it was so big but that's not really a bad thing! The regular bun held up really well and was so soft and tasty even on it's own.   I also had the dirty corn which was ok, it wasn't the best thing ever and I would probably just order something else next time instead.   The horchata was really good.   We came on a Friday night and it was very busy so there was limited seating. The service was great everyone was very nice and helpful.",

Both were unique and tasty.  The oreos and the horchata ice cream were delicious as well. Only issue I see is the fries.  Now, maybe if you load them up with stuff they're good but, they leave much to be desired.  Oh almost forgot... the elote (corn) in the cup!!! Holy smokes is it delicious!!! Will come again.",

Have tried the Dirty Chili Dog, the House Dog and the Elote Dog and recommend the Hose Dog and the Elote Dog. The Dirty Chili Dog is good, had it on the Portuguese Roll, but I only slightly prefer Carney's or Pink's over it. The House and Elote dogs were great on the lobster roll.  Sauces, add ons, and condiments were a perfect match on both of these if ordered as is. Would suggest either of these as your first dog here on the lobster roll. The sweet Portuguese roll doesn't seem to work for me and may be why I wasn't sold on the chili dog on my first visit. Hint, ask them then to cut the dog in half and you can share with a friend and try a different dog.",

Their menu has a veggie dog option so I was def in!   Veggie dogs can go wrong real quick because they can be mushy and have no flavor. I ordered the veggie dog green style and dirty fries. They were a little slow but as soon as I saw the food I was like YUM!! This is one of the few times I can say the real food looks better than the photos on the menu!   The dog was soooo good!! The frank itself was a little bland but the texture was perfect. The toppings had so much flavor that the frank didn't even matter. The dirty fries were amazing!! I wanted more!! Definitely coming back to try more of their goodies!!",

Upon entering, we were greeted by a very friendly woman at the counter with bright pink hair. The dining room is very cool/hip/clean. The music is mix of something you'd hear in LA - some reggae, kayne, and sublime made for a relaxed feel (maybe not so much the kayne, but personal opinion ha!).   We were asked if we had been there before and said \"no.\" The cashier went on to tell us about their hot dogs and which things she enjoyed the most. I went with the Red Dog and asked for the chili flakes on the side (I get worried when cooks have the ability to scorch my mouth with pepper flakes), the \"Dirty Esquite,\" a fried Twinkie  and a fountain drink. Came to roughly $14 - not bad at all!  The hot dog was pretty spicy without the flakes on top for a garnish. It was super flavorful, had a nice snap/crunch, and the traditional bun was perfect with it. The Esquite was packed with flavor! It comes with a lime wedge, which you definitely want to use. The fried Twinkie was, well, a fried Twinkie. It was delicious. But what set it off was the horchata whipped cream! Can i have that on every dessert for the rest of my life please?!  I can't wait to come back and try new dogs, sides and I'll be hitting that fried Oreos and churros on the next go 'round! Well done, Dirt Dog! Well done, indeed!",

The girl that was working the register had a great attitude and helped us with all kinds of questions. That's pretty much why they got three stars out of me.   The food...le sigh...I wasn't that excited. It tasted alright. My husband ordered The Green Dog and it was flavorful but the bread was pretty hard. I ordered the Dirty Chili Dog and it was ehh...nothing out of the ordinary. I did order it with the lobster bread which if you do decide to try out this place I recommend trying the hot dogs with the lobster bread! Makes it much more better. We also ordered garlic fries and BOY did I regret it. I felt like I was eating the whole clove of garlic. Waaaaay to much.   I loved the atmosphere there. Very laid back. Would I return again...honestly no. Even though they were very friendly and customer service was great but the food wasn't so great.",

I love that they have vegan dogs too! And the price for them is not that bad. Their churros are pretty good!",

When we got there man it was busy but the staff is great so the line moves quick. Since it was our first time we wanted to try quite a bit so we ordered the patty melt dog, the dirty chili dog, the dirty corn, and the filthy fries. We held off on dessert to see how big the portions were. MAN these hot dogs are huge and sooooo good. Everything was amazing. We were both so full at the end of our meal we didn't get dessert.. BUT next time for sure. This place is amazing. Definitely go try it out for yourself. A+ all the way around.",

My husband and son got plain bacon wrapped dogs on a butter bun and seasalt fries. No complaints there. I had the brown dog and filthy fries. I just about died with every bite of the brown dog. The flavor profile was spot on; saltiness of the dog and the sweet and savory of the teriyaki and sesame on the Portuguese bun. I got the chipotle aoli on the side which was a good thing since the salt and pepper already added a nice kick to the fries. Ended up maxing out but happily full.  Next was the churros. This was the only reason we took off a star. They were kind of puny in size (that's what she said) and unfortunately while they looked tasty, they ended up being raw inside.  All in all a great meal. We will probably pass on dessert next time. The takeaway message here is that there will likely be a next time.",

    "text": "As we were waiting on line, we noticed that many people left their half eaten hot dogs and corn on the table... hmmm... not a good sign that they didn't want to finish their food...  This was our first time trying this place out & will be our last time.  Waiting on line got a bit aggravating as people were pushing while they were trying to leave.    My kids don't eat a lot of junk food so with that being said, they think hot dogs and mexican corn is a luxury and \"special\" treat so they waited with highened anticipation for their late lunch.    We ordered 2 chili dogs, 1 plain mexican corn and 1 order of fries.  We were given 1 chili dog and 1 plain dog with no chili.  The one that actually had chili only had 1 bean in the chili mix.  Ummm... that was a bit strange.    My son took one bite of the mexican corn and said it was no good.  So I tried it myself to see what he was fussing about and I too, did not like the taste of it.  It just tasted weird.  Just at that moment, I turned to the table next to ours and saw that they had left without finishing their corn... they actually just took one bite and didn't eat the rest.  Uhhh I should have followed my instincts and not ordered the corn but my boy was begging for it.  I actually make it myself at home but figured it was easier to just order one then firing up the grill.  Lesson learned.    So, the hot dogs had no flavor and was not worth the $8.00 price tag. I would have been happier with Costco's hot dogs or buying Nathan's. The fries were bad too.  Who would have thought that they could mess up fries?  But they did.  I don't know what the deal is with them but after eating one, no one wanted any more.  Especially the kids.  They usually would scruff down fries and hot dogs in a jiffy, but this time after only 1 bite, they didn't want anymore.  My boy kept saying that he'll have pho from the restaurant next door.    So the ordering and waiting system is a little weird.  I went to sit down with the kids as my husband went to order the food.  Apparently I couldn't sit with the kids until I ordered and got a number.  Then I noticed there was a sign that said, \"No room to wait on the line.\"  Right, so that's why I want to go sit... but I couldn't until I got a number... One of the staff members actually came over to me to tell me that I needed to get up and get a number. That I had to let the people with numbers sit first. I told her that my husband was ordering the food right now and that the kids were tired and hungry.  I didn't go there to take up space and hog a table.  I was waiting on food.  Geesh, is that how they really do business?  I mean, do I look homeless or something where I'm just there to hang out and not buy anything?  The floors were really dirty, no one really sweeping up.  Seems like the employees were just pushing the table scraps onto the floor.  Maybe they have a dog somewhere where it comes and eats it all up (haha, maybe that's where they came up with their name).  But in all seriousness, it was not cool the way they treated me and my kids especially since my husband was already ordering.  They couldn't just let us sit for a couple of minutes while he paid and got a number?  Seriously, totally uncalled for.    I won't be back to spend my hard earned money at a place that doesn't value their customers or even serve decent food.",

The line was out the door, so I knew this place was going to be good as everyone said it was! I ordered their elote, and two street tacos--one carne asada, the other al pastor.   The restaurant itself is a decent size, but because of their constant surplus of customers, my cousins and I had to stand around and wait for a table to clear up, as most of the other diners there were in big groups. However, we didn't wait too terribly long for our food to come out, which was brought to us by one of their friendly staff members. I opted out of getting the elote with the hot cheetos, but it was still very, very delicious! My tacos were likewise very flavorful. Sadly, they were smaller than I expected them to be, which was a little disappointing.   I definitely want to eat here again, hopefully to try one of their hot dogs and indulge on another elote! It would be great if they opened up another location, too!",

They have different selection of hotdogs with variety of toppings that come with it, as well as french fries with toppings as well. All staff were very friendly and nice, came around asking how we were all doing from time to time. They food comes out pretty quick and there are TV's for customers to watch.

I don't eat meat so I've never said yes. But I finally gave in. Upon searching the menu, I saw that they have a veggie dog (win for me). I got their mutt dog with a veggie dog. It was so good!! I savored every bite. It was of their red and green hot dog -- half citrusy and half spicy. My boyfriend had their elote dog. While good, he said there was too much going on.   We also had the flaming elote and dirty fries. And wow. I stuffed every last bite of everything. I let no fry or piece of corn go to waste. The flaming elote had hot Cheetos and some aioli on it. It had the perfect amount of spice and crunch and taste to it. The dirty fries came with chipotle ranch. And the seasoning was so good!!  I would recommend. I like that it is vegetarian friendly as well. Yuuummmm",

Brian came up to the line to ask if there was any first timers and out of the 20+ people in line, we were the only ones. He explained the menu to us, made recommendations, and then asked if we wanted to grab a seat. He sat us down, took our entire order at the table, and checked us out so we didn't have to wait in line. We had our toddler with us that we were holding so it was really appreciated! He came and checked on us a couple times as well. The customer service was really great.   The food was great too! I had the green dog, my husband got a chili dog, and we decided to split a house dog (which they cut for us before they brought it to the table). We also got a side of garlic fries and an Al pastor taco just because. Everything was really good and really filling.   We will definitely be going back because I want to try the elote dog next! Thank you Brian!",

    "text": "Craving food from the City of Angels? This is one if the places that originated from LA. Located in a small shopping center in Southwest Las Vegas, you will find locals and a lot of people from Cali checking this place out.   When you walk in, line to order is just ahead. Did not like that part as this creates heavy traffic that loops the line into the exit line and to the people entering the establishment. This makes it hard for new comers and repeated customers from deciding on what to order. The menus itself are displayed to the right side of the wall making it harder for people to take a look see at the menu.   Inside they is pretty small as well, especially for those who have families to eat dinner with. There is a capacity of up to 30 people or so. If you plan on eating there come before 6 oclock. My fiance and I got lucky. Right when we walked in we were able to order right away.   Now the menu. They are known for their hot dogs and the street foods. The street foods they offer: street tacos, fried foods (fried oreos, Twinkies), horchata ice cream w/churro, garlic fries, chips, elote, and a few things off the secret menu.   What we ordered: the extra dirty chilli dog. You can choose from three different buns, but the one we chose was the lobster roll. The dog was dressed with onions, cilantro, chilli cheese, and topped with bacon. I ordered the horchata ice cream w/churro. We waited not long for the hot dog, but literally waited for more than half an hr for the ice cream. The girl working the tables and serving the orders had a bit of a miscommunication that I already received my order. Knowing that it was busy, she got upset, but later apologized.   How the food tasted: the hot dog was a 3/5 as the dog looked wayyyy bigger in other pictures. Its smaller in person, and the taste was over hyped. The bacon was too chewy and the bun made it extremely greasy rather than that OMG factor in our mouth feeling. However, the horchata ice and churro made up for the rest of our visit. Churro was hot and just freshly made. Horchata ice cream concept made me enjoy every bite as the ice cream tasted like the drink. Cinnamon, the nuts, and flavor balance out well.  Overall, will come back to try the other food when it is less busy.",

I can't even finish the food as eating fast food is hard for me anyhow but man I wish I could gobble it all up and I'm sure I will eventually.   The dogs are excellent quality. The lobster rolls are everything and give me ultra life!!!!         I can't wait to bring my friends from the east and Midwest out here ! Especially my Chicago cousins.

I was with my friend, Minda and both of us enjoyed their food and the ambiance of their place. Except for the part that they almost forgot our dessert order.   Menu: House Dog - because we wanted to try their dog we just opt for the simplest one---doesnt have too much garnish. We don't want to go crazy because we are really looking forward in trying their elotes.  Elotes - must try!  Dirty Corn and Flaming Corn - if you are an elote fan like me, this is a must try on their menu. If you ask, they can also cut the corn  so it's easier to eat or if you are sharing.   Garlic Fries - Yummy!   Fried Oreos and Churros - it was ok but I felt overwhelmed after eating them. I think because I was so full after eating all the carbs.",

We got a mutt dog that was half the red and half the green dogs. It felt like i was eating a taco, but it was in the form of a hotdog. It definitely had a kick and was delicious! Im not a huge hot sog fan but i really wanted to try this place out. I ordered the filthy french fries and the elotes cup and deep fried oreos. French fries were BOMB. I just overall like the texture of their fries.  I didnt need everything on top but they definitely added more flavor and excitement. You also have to eat the fries fresh. Its not the same when its soggy. The workers kindly left the container open for me when i took it home. I wish they couldve done the same with the oreos because those were disappointing. Wouldnt get the oreos again because you only get 2 oreos. Didn't feel worth it. The horchata cream is very unique and my boyfriend loved it! The elotes in a cup was unfortunately devoured by my boyfriend so I have no comment :(  Definitely worth a shot!",

If I had to rank which I liked more to the least it would be the dirty corn, mutt dog, flaming dog then chili cheese fries. All very good but some things were better than others. Don't remember what exactly was on the mutt dog but flavor was on point and the hot dog had a nice snap to it (LOVE!). Let's talk about the elote though!!! The char on that, MMM and the lemony goodness?!?... man my mouth is watering talking about it! Flaming hot dog was good, like the crunchy texture of the hot cheetos and corn but taking a bite of that, everything just fell off. Lastly the fries, they were super fresh like everything else but there was very little chili on the fries which was disappointing but still very good :)   Not sure the the price tag on everything but it was well worth it! Going to have to head to LA to grab this once in awhile!",

My husband got the...dog with the pastrami on it and an elote.    I loved my meal.  The elote dog was delicious, and very rich.  The hot dog was juicy, and the bacon around it was perfect.  My husband wasn't thrilled with his, he said it was too rich and too much food.    Service was good and quick, and the location was pretty clean.    We do plan to come back, we want to try out some of the fries next time.",

I was a bit skeptical on what to think since I have never really been a big hot dog fan. Boy, this changed as soon as I walked in and saw all the different kinds of hot dogs and other things on the menu.   The menu was easy to read, the pictures of the food on the menu seemed so real I could pull them out of the screen and eat them. It was definitely a good touch to the place when you walk in, makes you hungry immediately!   I got the Elote Dog which was incredible! I did not want to eat to much so I smooched off of my buddies picks. He got the Garlic Fries. These fries were off the hook! Needless to say, the food was great and the atmosphere was busy but well organized. They have so many things to choose from I probably could have stared at the menu for about an hour or so. Definitely makes you want to go back and order more.   Again, there is so much more! Hot Dogs, Corns, fries, and desserts! I recommend Dirt Dog if your looking to devour a massive piece of meat! hahaha..   Dirt Dog on S. Rainbow, thanks for making my first experience a good one, when I get a cheat day here soon, maybe ill swing by and try another amazing thing off the menu!   See you soon!",

    "text": "Dirt dog is a relatively large, but extremely busy place to dine in. Good thing people don't really order a lot, because customers are always standing up to leave. Just wait a bit, and you will find a seat in time.  Just know that it will take a good amount of time for your food to come out, especially when there is a relatively long line. It does get a little cramped in front of the cash register when there is a lot of people.   However, the workers understand the struggle, and are always willing to help! The customer service here deserves a 5/5 star rating!   Food: definitely amazing. Their carne asada fries are to die for and are one of my favorites in the entire city. All the hot dogs are seriously great, too. Hot dogs aren't even my favorite food, but I really dig this place. My favorite part of Dirt Dog is that they have a wall of different hot sauces that you can take back to your seat to give your food a bigger kick.   This place rocks and I can't wait to go back!",

So kind! I noticed that they treated everyone who walked in like family. We ordered the Flaming Dog, Elote Fries, Veggie Dog Patty Melt Style, Elote, Deep Fried Oreos & Churros. Everything was freakin' amazing!! They really take their time constructing the hot dogs and making it look instagramable! LOL! Generous toppings on everything. The crumbles on the flaming dog was perfectly crumbled. While taking a bite, just be cautious and not blow it off your dog lol. Seen someone so excited and probably took a deep breath while blowing out of their nose lol! Patty melt style had this spicy chipotle sauce along with creamy cheese and crunchy fries on it. Perfect!!!! They also made our desserts closer to when we were done and came to check up on us to see if we wanted them to make it right when we were halfway finished. Did that make sense? Because when I get excited I kinda type all over the place hah! The Churro was crunchy and soft + the horchata whip cream... YUM!!!! Wish it was a bit bigger like some Costco stuff! Anyways, the decor and music is awesome. So while you're enjoying your food, you see snoop dog on the wall looking at you along with Eminem. Haha pretty dope art work! This place is very open. Good amount of seating and you can see them prep your stuff in the kitchen. I gave this place a 5 star because I seriously love their customer service. One of the employees helped bring in a lady in a wheel chair along with her family to get a table. She sat down next to them to take their order to make them more comfortable. Didn't even expect them to get up to order and just literally made them feel at home. I wish I got her name! She helped us too and I was just in aw'd with how kind she is towards others. You don't see servers do that as often anymore. Going above and beyond for people. Human kindness at its finest!! Happy eating and happy dining my fellow Yelpers!!!!",

They had a very limited selection compared to their menu at their restaurant and the food really wasn't very good so I recommend making the drive to their S. Rainbow location.   They have a variety of choices for hotdogs and almost as many for their fries, all of which are fantastic. My personal favorite is the elote dog along with the fries. It might be slightly on the pricey end but the food has been phenomenal every time and the portions are generous so it's worth it in my eyes. The service is reasonably quick and unlike most places, the end result looks exactly as it does in the menu pictures.",

Also, there are different bun options, I order the lobster roll. A group of us ended up order one order of fries and fried Oreos. I sure recommend the fried Oreos they come with a side of cream that has like a hint of cinnamon.   They got real busy around 7-8 and the staff handled everything very well.

Ordered the dirty fries, a house dog on a lobster roll, a house dog on an original bun, and a green dog on an original bun. The house dogs were very messy but so tasty. The dirty fries reminded me of Five Guys Cajun fries. The green dog was my personal favorite- guac and chimichurri are great flavors to pair with a hot dog.   The atmosphere is definitely geared toward the younger crowd, with rap and house music.   Sadly, they forgot all about my dad's dog. Mom and I were almost done so my dad decided to ask about his. They apologized and made one right away. Also gave my dad a free drink to make up for it. Great service, nice guys.",

    "text": "So when we first walked in I was skeptical about $6 hotdogs (no side or drink included) and only a few options. The menu is as simple as it looks, but it works. I had The Green Dog, with chimichurri sauce and avocado spread, on a Portuguese bun, which is a slightly sweet bread. It was delicious. My husband had The Original, which is wrapped in bacon and topped with 1000 Island, ketchup and mustard, also on the sweet Portuguese bun. It was also delicious, though I liked mine better. We got a side of the chili and limon fries, that came with a spicy ketchup. They were good, and I think the ketchup definitely made them better. We also got the side of corn with cheese, though I can't remember what it was called. I didn't care for it, my husband liked it, and I think it would have been better mixed instead of layered. I might try it again. They couldn't serve beer last night because their machine wasn't cooling it. We both had the bottled, Mexican, Coke. The Coke was good of course, but we were disappointed that there wasn't any beer available. Luckily the food was good enough on its own. Other than the beer not being available there was one more negative and it had to do with cleanliness. It's a pet peeve of mine, but tables and seats had crumbs on them as we walked pass. Also, some of the staff was sitting and chatting, when someone should have taken the time to make a pass to clean up more.  The staff was all very friendly, even the ones sitting around for a bit. They played 90s music that was little loud, had sports plating on TVs, and had a big picture of Tupac on top of the soda fridge. Their only other location is in LA. I really enjoyed the food, and will for sure be back for another $6 hotdog. And who knows. Maybe the tables and seats no one is sitting at will all be clean as a bonus.",

    "text": "I had the Dirt Dog location in LA bookmarked, so I was excited to see they opened not just this location, but another one on the Strip (Grand Bazaar Shops) with more possible locations coming in the future. This location isn't on my side of town however the trek was well worth it! Maybe just maybe one day they will open closer to me! Inside was clean and the staff was very friendly and happy to answer questions I had about the menu. You can get your order to-go or they have a good amount of tables/seating inside. Tacos are a newer addition to the Dirt Dog menu and I thought they were pretty good. The dogs are really where it's at for me, but it's nice to have options.  Chicken Tinga Taco ($2) - Chipotle tomato sauce, onions and cilantro. Corn tortillas are currently the only option for the tacos, no flour. Holy shit this was a spicy taco! I loved the flavor and even though I seriously had sweat rolling down my face, I couldn't help but keep taking another bite.   Al Pastor Taco ($2) - The meat is marinated and grilled pineapples and onions are what tops this taco. Al Pastor is usually my taco of choice so I was really looking forward to trying this one. Sadly it wasn't good at all. When I picked up the taco it fell it was so soggy that all the fillings just fell through. The pineapple seemed canned, so not sure how it's getting grilled. I prefer fresh pineapple that you see getting sliced over a spit or grill.  Carne Asada Taco ($2) - Pico de Gallo and scallions top this red chile cilantro marinated asada. Good flavor and especially well liked by my hubby. They have some really tasty sauces/salsas here that pair nicely with this taco.   Dirt Dogs are about $6 each and come fully loaded. They don't skimp on toppings and have great flavor. I love the slightly buttered and grilled split-top buns (aka new england or lobster bun) and the bread holds the dog and toppings nicely. They also have Portuguese and traditional buns as an option.    The Dirty Chips are very good and I recommend adding cheese and meat of your choice it really takes these tasty chips up another level. Dirty Corn is reasonably priced and I didn't think it was bad, but I didn't think it was great either. My drink of choice here is the Horchata it's very good and better than I have had at other places recently. Oh yes, they also serve beer! For dessert you can choose from fried oreos or twinkies, horchata ice cream and churros. It's worth nothing for all the vegan eaters out there that they also have a vegan taco ($2) on the menu.",

The soy one tastes just like the real thing and I would never know the difference.  Although, Their elote in a cup is okay. Every time I've ordered it, it had way too much mayonnaise where I couldn't even finish it. This place is good don't get me wrong, but nothing mind blowing. It's definitely over-hyped & I wouldn't go out of my way to come here.",

    "text": "This place is literally hype due to social media marketing. I've even given the place a couple tries. The price is fine but for the food quality It doesn't fit. The food is all cosmetic. Basically what you see on the outside... And normally looks mouth watering but once you take that initial bite, its mediocre at best. With that said....maybe lower the prices. Not too mention the workers looked blitzed out their mind and once sat down the entire table party have to yell at eachother due to the excessive amount of a Tupac played in the background. ( Can't stand Tupac by the way) so never helps especially when im a fan of Hip Hop and know theres a huge variety out there. Tupac isn't the only rapper on the planet ok? Somebody is a die hard though due to the huge Mural painted on the wall. Lets lose the kid painting on the wall also yah? Just some parts look like a elementary cafeteria school art project.   Enough said. Mediocre at best. Food is a 5/10  Music too loud.",

Both served very fresh. The kids especially loved that their meals came with Oreos and sweet whipped cream to the side!  Now onto the staff. As if this place couldn't get any better... the staff is on it! They were all so polite and accommodating. I even saw a lady checking the temperature of each and every single of the small cups of cream (the sweet cream that was served with the Oreos). The hard work really shows here! Thank you and we will be back!",

They have the most creative style menu for hot dogs and tacos! Your taste buds will thank you!   The restaurant is not that large but is very hip! The counter is right when you open the door so a line can build up quickly. They have board games available like battle ship, monopoly, etc for you to enjoy with friends. The decor of the restaurant has some cool artsy designs on the wall. They are also opened late which is awesome! When I'm having a late night munchies craving this is the place to satisfy my hunger!  The staff is super cool! Very nice and friendly!   The hot dogs are nice and juicy. I've tried the Elote Dog, Chili Dog, and House Dog! I'm determined to try all the dogs they have! For desert I always get the churro! It's so good when it's warm and fresh!   Will definitely be back to complete my eat all hot dog mission!",

But You can't go wrong if you like hotdogs. There are s few buns to choose from and my buns are always great because I ask the staff which they recommend for each dog. The street corn in a cup is nice and clean but it does not compare to the flavor of the hot cheetoes street corn! A must if you like hot cheetoes!!! Also a must, the horchata ice cream!!!  The ice cream is shareable & It comes with a churro. The only problem is they are so busy, you have to order with your food order or wait forever in line again. The staff is pretty good about bringing it to you later after you've eaten. Originally from LA, you've got to check this place out.",

    "text": "How the heck can a hot dog be this good?    I mean, seriously.  It's like a whole new level of hot dog.  Unfailingly delicious and innovative toppings elevate these bacon wrapped dogs to heights heretofore unimagined.  Best sellers are the Red Dog and the Green Dog.  But why pick one or the other?  You can get both by ordering a Mutt.  Aye, that's the stuff!  You've gotta get the Dirty Chips.  They're dusted with just the right amount of seasoning.  Be SURE to try house made spicy ketchup.  They've got ranch, too, of course.  Woooo!  Chef Joana remembered me from my first visit.  I told her I've been jonesing for one of her Dirt Dog's ever since my last visit in July.  She made me a Mutt Dog that just couldn't be beat.    The location of Dirt Dog is sort of off the beaten path, but don't let that stop you from visiting.  This place is well worth the drive.  Dirt Dog doesn't disappoint!  Mikey C says: Love me some Dirt Dog!",

The service was good all friendly staff but for $35 it just wasnt worth it. We also got the deep fried oreos which were a total disappointment. Kinda sad was expecting so much more for everything I heard about this place. Another positive is they have 12 beers on tap...",

My husband is a big fan of Dog Haus so as soon as I saw this place I knew we just had to try it!       Although small and quaint the atmosphere was very chill and relaxed. Menu was posted on the wall to the right as you come in the door so no confusion or fuss as to what to choose. Also the staff is very nice and helpful with answering any questions you may have.I had their House Dog which was excellent and my husband had the Green Dog with a substituted soy dog in place of the beef. Between the two of us we shared the dirty fries.      I love the fact that the menu is short, simple, and to the point. I can't wait to go back and try it again. Especially that dirty corn and horchata ice cream!  *I gave this place only 4 stars  because it is not very kid friendly. My husband and I had our daughter with us who is just a toddler. I asked if there was any way to just purchase half a hot dog with no toppings. The man working the front informed me that I would be charged full price *$5.95 and that a kids menu was in the works. That's fine and all but full price for a half hot dog for a toddler? That's a bit much in my opinion but we made do and just shared what we ordered with our daughter. Also there is no changing table in the women's bathroom, I'm going to guess that there will be parents bringing their toddlers and babies in sometime that may need to be changed. So it's a good idea to have one installed in both the women AND men's bathrooms. They at least had high chairs, so good job on that! Other than that excellent service, food, and overall experience.",

We both got fries and then ordered dessert. We ordered the churro with horchata ice cream. They were out of churro batter but made up for it by giving us deep fried Oreos and a deep fried Twinkie. I'm not big on twinkies, but throw a little batter on anything and toss it in a deep fryer and apparently that makes it delicious. ;). The ice cream was really good and the dipping sauce that came with the Twinkie was divine!! Horchata flavored whipped cream. Overall a really good experience!",

It took 35 minutes to get my order of a hotdog and fries. It's a hotdog. Second, the food is overpriced. $6.25 for a hotdog and the biggest rip Off is $3.25 for French fries that were frozen then fried. I wouldn't pay $1 for those fries. Third, food was ok but again a hotdog. Fried Oreos were good. Overall, if you want to save yourself an hour and overpaying for average food, avoid this place.",

The service was good and everyone was attentive and made sure we were satisfied.   I decided to order the Green Dog and the Mexican corn in a dish as a side. You are able to pick the bun you want with your hot dog so I picked the Lobster bun based off the recommendation of the server. The roll has nothing to do with lobster so if you aren't a sea food fan do not let this scare you away. I was glad I did because it was really soft and buttery.  The hot dog itself was pretty good. The only recommendation I can give is to grill hotdogs. They taste so much better when they are grilled and I think it would really enhance the flavor. I also wished they put the guacamole on the top of the dog instead of in the roll because it was hard to taste that way.  The corn was good as well but I wish there was a little less cheese because it overpowered the corn.   Overall it was ok, just wish they were able to grill the hot dogs.",

The proprietors of this establishment should really consider buying the land adjacent to this location to expand the parking lot or, at the least, put some lights in the parking lot. It's nearly pitch black out there and even as one that has good eyes, it is hard to see.  Inside, I was impressed. The layout was nice and chill. I was surprised by the hip-hop influence in everything from the music selection to the art work on the walls. Someone is a huge 2Pac fan; I loved it. The tables are plentiful and the dining area is spacious. Folks weren't on top of each other, but it still felt intimate.  My partner and I ordered our food with unfettered excitement. I don't remember the name of what I had, but I recall getting the lobster bun. That part was absolutely delicious. It was buttered on both sides and so soft. The taste of the dog itself was okay. Admittedly, I will say it was probably a poor selection. It had nacho cheese and bacon bits on it, but the dog wasn't very big and I found myself still hungry. This would've been okay had I not spent so much for the experience.  I also ordered the loaded fries that guacamole on them and that was terrible. The guac was waaaaay to smooth and creamy, so much so that it seemed like a guacamole puree. That added a taste that completely ruined the rest of the fries and I ended up throwing them away.  I would go back to try something else. I am hopeful that I'd have a better experience next time, if I choose a different menu item and stick to the basic fries.",

I was searching for cheap eats and this place popped up.   The cashier asked if it was our first time, then proceeded to tell us more about the items on the menu. Every dog comes wrapped in bacon. They also have tacos. I went with the house dog, which is the closest thing to an LA street dog. Got it on texas toast! It was simple, yet really fresh and satisfying. I took a bite of the hubby's chilli dog, which was just ok. The winner was the elote in a cup. Convenient and delicious.   One star off because it seems like the workers try to rush you out by clearing your table when you clearly have more food left. I get it. It gets busy, but let me enjoy my food. Also, modern places never have fresh aguas frescas...why?! A refreshing strawberry, pineapple or cantaloupe frescas would hit the spot.",

I had the dirty fries (housemade Chile and limon seasoning with spicy ketchup). We had it late at night and I was craving fries and didn't want anything too heavy. If it was for lunch or dinner, I would definitely try the other dogs or the elote fries. I was satisfied!",

I ordered the plain bacon wrapped dog with the veggies (bell peppers and onions). It was good and the bread they use, the put butter on it and grill it. Nice touch!  The 5 Stars is really for the service.  I was there on 12/16 The front counter girl is awesome, great service! There's a girl that was working there that impressed me. She's short (like me) and had curly, dark hair. I don't know her name but that girl was on point in delivering food to the tables and getting the tables clean, all while smiling and being personable! She deserves a raise! Next time I go in, I'll ask her name so I can post it here.",

My friend got the al pastor fries and I got the elote dog both of which were SO GOOD. Service was very friendly, giving us great recommendations and they even gave me options for the type of bun which was cool. Although it was super messy to eat, the flavor was the absolute best!!

From the quality of meat, to the detailed presentation, and the impeccable service, this place has nailed the epitome of the perfect casual dining experience.  When my family arrived, we were absolutely clueless about what to order. Everything looked amazing, and were trying to narrow our options down. Luckily, the cashier was more than pleasantly helpful. She patiently and enthusiastically explained the menu. That kind of service is rare in in casual establishments. We ordered the mutt dog, the red dog, corn, carne asada fries and horchata ice cream.  I dont have one negative critique. Everything was phenomenal.  I only wish my stomach would have had more room for another hotdog.",

    "text": "Lemme start by saying I LOVE the food I ate here. I had the \"green dog\" and Dirty Corn.  Firstly, the dirty corn was probably the best elote I have had in Las Vegas. The dog was really good. A high quality dog with house made avocado, grilled onions and bell peppers, chimichurri sauce and sprinkled with bacon. It was very good. I will be coming back , but I wont be setting any speed records in doing so. Although I did receive friendly service, It was also sloooooooow service. I was there on a Saturday night at 730 pm...so that could be considered a busy time. There was a rush of about eleven customers who showed up near the same time that I showed up, and the entire place almost came to a stand still. Yes, part of the slow down was the customers, who after 9 minutes of standing in line inches away from a wall display that showed all the menu items and prices, suddenly could not decide what they wanted when they approached the register. But the other factor was the employees who absolutely displayed no hustle whatsover. As previously mentioned, they were friendly, just slow. I stayed long enough after I ate, and after the rush of people died down, to see that there was no difference in the hustle of the employees between the times when there was a rush of people, and the time when the crowd had died down and they were serving one or two customers. They all had one speed and it wasnt fast. If your team cant pull it together for the 20 minute rush crowd, and pick up the pace to get everyone ordered  and served, then you probably will have problems with customer satisfaction and repeat business. Again, I LOVED the food, and will be back. I just wont return if there seem to be more than 4 people in line because it will take FOREVER.",

The dog itself was VERY JUICY, and has that \"SNAP\" when you bite into it.  The bun was a sweet roll...compliments the dog perfectly. I don't really eat fries, unless they're frozen from the grocery store, or McDonalds. These fries tho...they have a crispy batter, and are tender on the inside. They were simply seasoned with sea salt & pepper.   If you have one near you, go see them. You won't be disappointed!",

The salt and pepper fries are just that, salt and pepper fries.  Nothing special, but not bad.  We tried the dirty chili dog and the green dog and left completely satisfied.  We also got the taco al pastor and it was extremely flavorful.  Would we return?  Absolutely!  We gotta get dirty again!",

But next time I will be trying the elote dog one cause that looked amazing. My bf tried the patty melt dog and it had just the right kick of spice to it with fries and bacon and cheese. And that was good as well. & being from Cali you know we had to get the elote too. There corn tasted super fresh! We will be coming back here forsures! Also the workers were super nice & all happy with smiles on there face. & that's what I enjoy most about going to places to eat the most.",

The Horchata was a little TOO sweet for my liking but I simply just added water and it fixed the problem ;)  Also, since I got the elote Dog, I got the loose elote in a cup so for every bite of the hot dog, I added more of that elote corn.  Check it out! They have cool inside and they play good music :D the cashier was really nice too. If you wanna gage on how much it would be.. for me and my boyfriend, we spent around $35",

It's very little and there's not enough spots to accommodate the businesses there. The staff inside was friendly. They were nice enough to move some tables for us so we could fit everybody since there was very limited space left in the place. They have a good variety of options to choose from. I tried out the pastrami dog and the al pastor fries. Originally when my order came out, they got it wrong and put onions and mayo on mine when I can't eat those things. But they were nice enough to make new ones for me and I was able to give my sister in law the ones I couldn't eat. It's a lot bigger portions than  I thought it would be after all of the toppings get put on. The price are a little high, a bit pricey for a hot dog, but the flavors are good. I think my hot dog, fries and drink were close to $20. They also have an option for a few different buns that you can choose from. I tried their I believe frescas and their cantaloupe one was actually pretty good. I'm sad that there isn't any locations in the NW or anywhere near me so my husband can try the place out. It's quite a long drive from us, but I will stop in again next time i'm on that side of town to try something else.",

I had a brown dog which was teriyaki and sesame aioli -Yum The husband had the extra dirty dog- loaded with chili ( mild) bacon and melted cheddar cheese. And he loved every bite!       Can't wait for another trip to Vegas. We will definitely go back and try another flavor. We also tried the ice cream but we didn't have enough time to take a picture because we ate it!

Their Specialty Hotdogs (Dirt dogs) are all priced between $6.25-$7.25, and they aren't your average hotdogs, these are loaded with the good stuff. My favorite is the House Dog ( bacon thousand island, onion, bell peppers, green chile, of course bacon bits! , ketchup, mayo and mustard) and you can even choose a lobster bun for that!   Sides - pleaseee get the Dirty Esquite! (Corn in a cup with cotija cheese, cilantro and chili powder) amazzingg! And the Filthy Fries (guac, chipotle aioli, cheddar and cotija cheese ) another one for the win!   And of course, a meal won't be complete without dessert, at least for me, I ordered the Deep Fried Oreos served with Horchata Ice Cream and sprinkles, the oreo was not oily, and its freakin delicious!!   There's few seating near by,but some days they fill up fast. Location is in the Grand Bazaar Shops, you can type in the address and it will take you there.   The service is great!

I got the flaming dog, my wife got the elote dog, the elote corn,and we got parmesan fries to share.  Both dogs were good and juicy, but the fries were dry and felt old.  Also, the elote corn wasn't the traditional elote we are used to.   There was no mayo layered on the corn before the cheese and chili was put on there, so it made it feel as if we were eating just regular corn on the cob with cheese and chili dust.  Oh, almost forgot, we got the fried oreos to share for dessert.   Even though we saw them come straight from the kitchen. They tasted cold, and the outside interior was really doughy and cold.  EDITED: 12/10/2018  After Melbony contacted me regarding my experience. Nicole and Daniel from Dirt Dog remade our whole order, and everything came out like it was supposed to.  This has definitely restored our faith in Dirt Dog, and have made us returning customers.  Rock On Dirt Dog!",

    "text": "Update: I went back tonight and I'm happy to report that my first review did not do this place justice. My reasons are below. I do want to note, in the interest of full disclosure, that Timothy (owner) did invite me back but the food was so good this time around that I offered to pay (twice!). It says a lot about a business when the owner is willing to stand by his product. So thanks for hosting me Timothy and let's get into it!  1) House Dog- I tried this on my last visit and wasn't sold on the lobster roll bun. This time I opted for the Portuguese bread and what a difference! It was toasted perfectly and it stood up to the sauces... home run!   2) Al Pastor Fries- I'm pleased to report that the seasoning on the fries has been adjusted and is no longer overly salty! I did prefer the Al Pastor over the Asada fries from my last visit. One suggestion: if they were to leave the meat on the grill just a little longer so it gets that nice char this would be perfection!   3) Dirty Esquite- this was reason I wanted to come back! I had never tried it with a bit of lime or bacon. It was different but quite tasty! The change elevates street food nicely.   4) Horchata Ice Cream & Churro- this is the stuff dreams are made of! I'm still kicking myself for not trying this on my first visit. The ice cream has the perfect balance of sweetness to the vanilla. It's topped with puffed rice and almonds for crunch. The warm churro as a contrast is golden and delicious.  If they sold the ice cream in pints, I would buy it!",

We got the veggie green dogs (soy-based dog with chimichurri sauce & guac & grilled veggies), vegan fries (with soyrizo and guac), garlic fries (again of course), and the vegan street tacos. OMG so full and so good! I definitely recommend this as a vegan/plant-based go-to for awesome \"hot dogs!\"  Also, service is still great and there is such a beautiful, fun waitress who was tending to everyone eating. She was dancing and having a great time! It made the whole place seem more lively. Love this place for a good American meal!  The only thing I wish they had was a vegan mayo to add in their awesome sauces!",

I absolutely hated it imagine mouthfuls of chipotle mayo on a hot dog and that is the patty melt. I thought it would be cheesy goodness but it was just a painful amount of chipotle mayo. Almost everything had chipotle mayo on it and nobody can enjoy that much chipotle mayo and be sane. I wish they developed flavors more instead of squirting some Kroger's chipotle aoili on the whole thing.",

Steps down from soap box. Now the bad...the Brown Dog was super duper, like burn my tongue...salty. My hubby couldn't even eat it. I ate the dog after I scraped everything off of it and ate it alone. Then we got a Deep Fried Twinkie, the Horchata whipped cream was yummy. The Twinkie would've been yummy if it wasn't drenched in grease, we ate most of it but couldn't stand the layer of grease left in our mouths. Price on par with all the other hot dog joints in town. I'd go back just because its close to home.  In my book, Buldogis is still #1 for hotdogs in LV.",

    "text": "I really wanted to like this place. I am such a fan of good hot dogs! I kept seeing this place pop up on my YELP as a \"NEW and HOT Business\"  and being that it's on the southwest area of town made it kind of convenient to drive to since I'm not that far away. I assumed this until I actually got into the car and start driving here. It's located in a pretty random area and not to mention a bit tricky to find depending on which way you are coming from. I had to ask myself \"No why would they put this location way out here\" Anyways so I finally located this place and pulled in.  Service is so HUGE in my book especially when you are a new establishment. I have to say that I wasn't impressed at all with the level on friendliness or service. I've had better service and hot dogs from Wienerschnitzel's.. No Shade! For starters, when I walked in I wasn't acknowledged and finally when somebody did come from the back they just looked at me look at the menu. No \" Hello!...Welcome!...Any questions on the menu?...\" you know the key components that I thought come pretty standard in a business. With you being a new place you usually have people make suggestions on the menu or hell even ask do you have any questions?. When I was finally greeted my order was taken and the guy who took my order went right back to talking to his friend or maybe a co-worker that was sitting at the counter about personal plans for the weekend. He was more concerned with getting back to that conversation than worrying about my first experience here. Not a good start at all. I ordered the House Dog... Red Dog... Sea Salt Fries.. Ran me a little over $15 and some change. Wait time on the food was quick. I opened my bag to make sure that the order was correct which it was. When I was on the way home of course I wanted to nibble on some fries only to find they weren't as fresh as I know they probably could've been. I was pretty much over it at this point and a little sorry I made the trip to try it out. The hot dogs were just OK.. Just didn't give me that WOW factor. You could tell they'd been sitting for a while and tasted maybe even a tad bit overcooked? Idk maybe I should've tried it on a different bun or maybe I didn't do that because it wasn't even suggested at the time of ordering. In my mind I feel if you have 3 different buns to offer I'm sure some of these buns are probably paired better with different type of hot dogs that the employee can kindly suggest. That didn't happen. I have to mention all this because these are simple things that can cost people from wanting to even come here to dine. I can't say that I'd be back anytime soon too many cons than pros...And if I do hopefully the experience will be a lot better.",

Cashier was serving food and sweeping after we ordered. I had the chorizo tacos, they're okay nothing I can't do at home. Hubby is a big fan of hotdogs and wasn't amazed he said there was nothing special. I took the corn cup to go and didn't like it, it had \"OIL\" in it and too much cheese just didn't tasted right. I guess the highlight of the order was the fries.",

But, the cup of elote had a little too much mayo in it for my taste, next time I'll just get the cob version. I will certainly be back. Let me mention one more thing, most of my good experience came from my interaction with Akia, one of the employees. She was an absolute delight!! Someone get that girl a raise!!!",

My business partner had never had Jamaica so she offered to let us so taste it first!  They went above and beyond to make sure is picky and particular diners had an rave-worthy dining experience.  Too many good choices to choose from on the menu.  We ended up getting the patty melt dog and dirty corn!! Both were amazing! The lobster roll is definitely worth the extra $0.50. I had horchata and my friend ended up having the Jamaica! The only thing I left disappointed about was the fact that I didn't leave room for dessert lol!! We'll definitely be back...I can't wait to bring the family!",

    "text": "Shout out too my partner and yelper Suzy H for telling me about Dirt Dog. We decided to go on there soft opening date. I know not the most ideal time check out brand new restaurant. They had some kinks that needed work out. None of the taps were running, fountain machine was down, and most of the bottle drinks never had time chill. It was expected so NONE of it bothered me. Really the star of the show was the Dirt Dogs.   So one thing always count on dining with Suzy H we make sure try the menu. We got three different dogs. The Green, Red, and the Mutt dog combination of the two (also secret menu item). The Red Dog stole the show out of the three. At first thinking not that spicy after the first couple bites. Talk about subtle just kick you right in the mouth. By the end was hurting needed take breather before started on the second Green Dog. I like spicy food. It not crazy over the top heat but just be warned some kick too it. Green Dog fan of the chimichurri sauce. Overall nothing that stood out or worked for me compare to the Red Dog. Or maybe the Red Dog killed my taste buds. lol!!! The Mutt Dog if looking try both really great option.   The base of all the hot dogs are bacon wrapped Nathans brand hot dogs. I have seen before but not whole menu based alone on the concept. I love the concept!! The bacon nice crispy on the outside. It gives the hot dog more body and keep Nathans hot dog more moist/hot. The topping on both dogs really complimented the whole dog. The Green Dog not make as much of lasting impact compare to the Red. The buns that another Dirt Dog concept or one of the options lobster style roll. I think lobster roll should be given with any Dirt Dog. It not only reminded me of quality lobster roll sandwich. It adds so much more flavor then regular hot dog bun. Talk about reasonable priced. Not only reasonable compare to basic hot dog on any strip casino or casino. The quality your getting speaks for itself. The simplicity of the menu fan of three different parts Dogs, Sides, and Desserts. Less think about and for me everything had was awesome or solid. The sides we got the Garlic Fries and Mexican Corn. Both solid.   The desserts that FIVE star da bomb. I came back on second visit ONLY for desserts. Nothing could damper the fact had my first Deep Fried Twinkie. Deep Fried Oreo enough said. They ran out of Horachata Ice Cream. I like the fact they make it fresh every day and went at the end of service . They ran out. Just gives me another reason come back!!! Second visit came with my cousins visiting and doing out tradition food tours around Vegas. Dirt Dog was perfect dessert spot on my radar and talking about Deep Fried goodness. It was heavenly. The Twinkie the cream that came running out on was awesome. They have sauce for both but truth neither one needs it.   The service every person came in contact with was friendly, awesome, and the manager very much around checking on guests. Five star service both times I visited.   One thing find the place is if looking for it at night. The sign no lighting around it. If anything look for Sparklings well lit sign and its in the same parking lot.",

I Ordered the Green Dog and it was amazing to say the least. The Dirty Corn is a must have. We also ordered Horchata IceCream and churro. My husband said he would come here just for that dessert. On top of all that, they were playing the jammmms! A mix of some 90s RB, some Elvis, Ben E. King...some super chill vibes! Definitely coming back and bringing some friends!",

My favorites were of course the corn + the horchata ice cream!!! The ice cream came with a warm churro on top plus rice crispies mixed in with everything. The prices were reasonable not bad at all.

Also, there's not a whole lot of seating areas for a place so popular, I would have loved for this place to have had a patio to sit at. On nice days/evenings it would be cool to have a patio option.

The menu is simple but each variation has such a different and delicious flavor profile. Each hotdog is around 7$ which may seem pricey; however, quality surpasses the cost by a mile. I have been here multiple times and I am always impressed.   I ordered the green dog and the red dog. The green dog was not spicy and had guacamole as one of the ingredients. The red dog had chili flakes and onions and peppers. I would order both again! This last time, I ordered the horchata and churro ice cream dessert. And omg the ice cream was out of this world. The churro was small and kind of just added a nice crunch to the dish.   If you're in the southwest area, I highly recommend checking this place out!",

From my husband: I can honestly say they have one of the best chili dogs I have had since moving back to the west.  I hope it does well there is also one on the strip in front of Ballys!!  So in short, my husband will be back but I won't. Overpriced for my limited taste buds.",

The cheese was a perfect amount not skimpy and not over the top. We also had the garlic fries which were very crisp and wasn't overwhelming topped with garlic chunks which I appreciated. The girl who took our order was very pleasant and went over the whole menu with us. The atmosphere was super cool with Los Angeles inspired murals and a large city map. There also is a giant wall of hot sauces about every kind you could think of that you can pick from to use on your hot dog, we will definitely be making the trip to eat here every time we are in town!",

Service with a smile, and they will take your dogs to you, if you're seated nearby. Thanks, Dirt Dog",

(I love hippies, and meat) the House Dog was kick ass, #TheDirtyCorn, dirty chips, dirty fries, pattymelt dog, everything was amazing (the fam & hippy friends gave good reviews). I also liked the huge map on the wall and the whole concept of putting a sticker where you lived. It's fun urban hot dog joint with great quality food, and great service. 5 stars for DirtDog",

I got the Veggie dog which is soy based! The price and portion for the food is decent. If you're big fan of Elote, try their dirty corn! I really enjoyed their fries. There are numerous sauce you can use. Try getting the garlic sauce! Best time to come is before 2/3 before the high schoolers across the street come out. Anything after that time during the weekdays, expect it to be packed! Overall, it was a nice place for lunch with throwback RnB musics playing in the background!",

And elote corn on the cob also awesome.  Beer on tap a nice thing too   Problem is, my hot dog came out looked great so I started eating it and I had one but left when the French fries canes ten minutes later. The French fries were scorching hot right out of the deep fryer which imo is good and bad. Good cuz it's cooked fresh but bad cuz my hot dog was gone and I have Fries that are too hot to eat right away. And then the corn came 5 min later.   I recommend bringing the food out together not in pieces as their ready. Had they done that even if the fries were warm instead of hot it would've been a more enjoyable meal.   All in all great place I'll be back.",

    "text": "LA is one of my favorite cities for so many reasons. The convenience of getting a street dog out there after events, concerts, games, and even just shopping is just one of them lol. As many times as I tried to re-create the LA dirty dog, alley dog, Tijuana dog, whatever you want to call it, it just doesn't hit the palate the same way.   Having Dirt Dog just 10 min away has been a great way to suffice my cravings. Honestly, all the hotdog variations we've tried have been really good. I usually go for the one that closely resembles the OG LA dog. We tried their horchata ice cream when they first opened, and omg that was pretty darn amazing. My kids love, love their deep fried Oreos.  One star docked off because of a few things. First of all, the garlic fries sounds so good, but when they come out, they are not that great. I am an elote fanatic! I'm an original customer of the ones that used to come around my neighborhood in Cali that are sold in carts. The elote here I feel like is missing some of its authenticity. It's just a little too Americanized. Can't explain but my feelings are real lol. Lastly, for hotdogs, it's pretty pricey. Even for a plain bacon wrapped hotdogs for the kids, it's the same price.  In conclusion, we will continue to come back. We just know what to get and what not to get now. Service has always been great. We love the music played there. Totally our era!!",

The best hot dog I've ordered anywhere. My wife ordered the carne asada fries and they were ok, to me the asada tasted like chipped beef but my wife is super picky and she liked them. They also had Coke from Mexico, which I love. It's a bit expensive but to me as an every once in a while place it's worth it. Even if you don't like hot dogs you should try this place cause it might change you mind about them. To me the best hot dog place in the whole Vegas area.",

Don't even bother to get it without the lobster bun, because I think that's what complemented the dogs in a perfect way.   The corn on the cob was out of the world. However, my second attempt, they somewhat skimped on the sauce and cheese, so it wasn't as good.   The horchata whip cream is like crack. The deep fried oreos and twinkies were amazing, and by far the best I've had. As for the churros, they seemed a bit burnt. The second time I ordered it, it was the same, so must be something about the dough/temperature of the oil.  The fries were legit, and so were the chips. You can't go wrong here, and the price is reasonable as well.",

    "text": "Oh my flippin gosh.... Stepping inside, the scent of onion and cilantro welcome you into their warm embrace. It smelled delicious in here!!! The menus were lit, clearly placed, and had high definition photos of each food selection. The cashier was explaining the food to the couple in front of us and was very friendly.   Food: They have a menu created from the famous LA Street Dog (Los Angeles). Being an LA native, I can attest that those Bacon wrapped hot dogs with grilled onions, mayo, ketchup, mustard is to die for!!! But the Po-Po be chasing them off and the city of Los Angeles bans them!! That's because they were sold by illegal immigrants. This establishment has hot dogs (including a Veggie Dog), but they also have different kinds of fries, as well as Tacos. They even have Jamaica (Hibiscus punch) and Horchata, Coke fountain drinks, AND a BAR! We got a Green Dog, Al Pastor Fries, and an Elote (corn on the cob). AY CHIHUAHA!  DIOS MIO!! My hot dog was in a toasted, warm, buttery lobster roll (you choose the type of roll you want from 3 selections). Flavors were ON POINT. The Al Pastor Fries were my absolute FAVORITE (so far, this was my first visit after all). There were big chunks of pineapple, thick chunks of pork (literally tasted like Chorizo to me), sour cream, cilantro, lime, oh yeah and french fries. And it was enough for 2 people to share! The Elote was delicious!   Ambiance: It was Urban. Graffiti artwork on the walls, gangsta rap/ West Coast rap/90s hip hop. The cashier was tatted up. The crowd was Urban (mostly minorities) but to my surprise older White people were there too. The restaurant was pretty full and a long line was formed after we sat. 2 big flat screen TVs. Even games to play at your table (cards, Jenga, etc) while you wait. Even the floors had artwork on them. There was a section of a wall full of hot sauces!!! They had my fave brand, Marie Sharps.   Overall I had a great experience. The only negative was an obnoxious customer snapping pictures of everything. He even asked me to move so he could take a photo of the artwork at the register. OBNOXIOUS.   I highly recommend this joint, it really embodies LA, the Latin flavors and spirit. It's a very chill place! The cooks were also professionally dressed too, so it is very evident that they take pride in this business and that the Chefs are allowed to create magic.",

    "text": "We had been looking forward to this place after all the amazing photos on Pinterest.  Inside the decor is amazing. It's convered in great artwork on all the walls. You enter and had 9 to the register to give your order. Every menu item on the wall has a picture giving you a great display of what to expect. After purchasing you find a seat, get your drinks and utensils and they'll bring you your meal.  A nice extra here is that they have an assortment of games you can check out with your ID so you can have a fun time with friends. They also have a wall of hot sauces to try and a large map where you can  where you are from.  We went as a family and everyone tried something different. We tried 3 different hot dogs, loaded fries and elotes cob and cup style. No one was thrilled with their meal. We even switched and tried each other's. It was all a bust.  Elotes- this is a city where you can get great elotes just about anywhere. I've tried them with mayo and with crema.  I don't know what way they did theirs but it was flat out not good. The flavor was just way off. Even the cob corn wasn't good. It had very little flavor and the kernels were super small and barely a nibble. No one finished theirs. And my step dad is one of those people that will eat anything if he spent money on it. If he can't finish it he takes it home for later or for the dogs.   We didn't take anything home.  Hotdogs- the big deal about the dogs is that they are wrapped in bacon and grilled. Sounds so delicious but everyone said they couldn't even taste the bacon. It just was cooked to nothing. The toppings looked better than they tasted. Was underwhelming.  Fries- got the carne asada fries. The fries had a battered coating on them when they picture plain cut fries. So that was it for me. Can't do coated fries. The carne was tough and chewy and didn't have a good flavor. The sauce was good though.   The place is really popular though. Seems  busy but for this family...it was a huge no. 5 out of 5 of us said they can't do elotes right.  Really tasted like over priced carnival food. There's nothing to entice us ever to return. We were so disappointed",

Definitely unique food and great service (especially the hard working guy that was waiting on the tables, talking to customers, cleaning up, doing a great job! (sorry I missed your name!)) . Chimichurri on a hot dog was really different and tastey.  Would like to come back to try all the different combos.  -1 star for the really loud rap music.  I totally get it that the music is all part of the vibe, just not so loud to make us (and the table next to us) in a hurry to leave.",

Now on to my experience- I had the Elote Dog, a must have from all the envious pictures that I've seen craving this place! I loved the juicy dog and the crunchy \"Lobster Roll\" bun. The elote corn was lightly sweet and tangy from the slice of lime that accompanied. I will say that the sauce on this dog already has lime in it making the dog just a tad bit over-limey. BUT Still a great lunch/dinner spot! I can't wait to come back and try dessert next time! Thanks Dirt Dog! I'll be back!",

    "text": "We've drove by this place plenty of times and finally decided to try it out.  Once you pull into the plaza it's hidden in the corner so if you see the Pho place it's right next to there (hopefully the Pho place doesn't close so you can still find it).    Cons (reason for non-five star rating) The bun.  My fiance and I both ordered our hot dogs with an original bun and both were a bit hard, which made it hard to bite into. When we picked up our hot dog, the bun was completely split in half, like two pieces of bread with a hot dog in-between.  I'm not sure if it's supposed to be like that, but it made the hot dog definitely hard to eat and super messy because everything was falling apart.  I think for a hot dog place, the hot dog and bun should not disappoint.   I ended up having to use a fork and knife.   What's the fun in that !    Pros 1.  Friendly service.  Right when we walked in we were immediately acknowledged and she asked us if we've been there before.   We told her it was our first time and she gave us a breakdown of the menu.  Definitely a plus !   2.  Great choice of music.  There were plenty of times when my fiance and I said, \"man I haven't heard this song in a minute.\"  Definitely old school hip hop with a combination of current music genres.     3.  The dirty corn aka their version of the elote.  I definitely enjoyed the spices they put on it and the corn was cooked just right !   4.  Garlic fries, I would've preferred more garlic or salt on the actual fries, but I think it was a pro because I enjoyed the housemade garlic dip that it came with.  Overall, great first experience and I would like to come back to try other items on the menu and perhaps the hot dogs are better on the lobster roll versus an original.  I'll be sure to keep you updated !",

The food is pretty American.  Like in the 90s when all your parents fed you were hot dogs and pizzas and burgers xD  Imagine that but better.  They have like a vegan dog but it's aight.  The other stuff is better but even then I don't think the price is justified.  Been here only a handful of times with an empty stomach and some time to visit but I think this place caters to many that just really obsess over hot dogs.  People who casually eat or just like that rustic or lots of toppings, hot sauces will feel at home.  Anyone looking for more, won't find it here I think.",

I wasn't sure what to order so I asked Anisha what she recommended. She recommended the \"Green Dog\" and the Chili Dog. I decided to order the Chili dog on the lobster roll bun, Al Pastor taco, and the Horchata Ice Cream with a Churro.   The Chili Dog - was made with a house made spicy aioli, bacon and cheddar cheese. I didn't realize until after the fact that it had Aioli. I must say that I hate Aioli or Mayo. However, it was really good.  The Al Pastor - was marinated and seasoned really well with onions, and pineapples.   The Churro and Horchata Ice Cream - was one of the best Churros that I've had in a long time. It was super moist in the inside and crunchy on the outside.   Anisha, made my experience a Dirt Dog a memorable one. She went above and beyond with making sure I enjoyed my food, she also informed me of the other location as well, since, I'm new to the Las Vegas area. I will definitely come back again.",

This place does not skimp on the ingredients. And it will fill. you. up. We like spicy so I got the Red Dog and my fiance got the Chili Dog, with a side of the Dirty Corn. I recommend this combo if you're a person who can't do a meal without a spicy kick to it. I'd give the hot dogs themselves 4 stars for flavor and satiation. Sadly we have to deduct a star because we both felt very sick the next morning and had weird poops from it the next day as well. We probably won't ever go back due to that morning after experience but I can say we're both glad we got to have at least one dirt dog in our life before we die.",

The corn tasted like kerosene. I thought I would be eating the corn similar to the LA (Santee alley) mexi corn but nope! Tried a simple bacon wrapped hot dog, it was just ok. Garlic fries was supposed to be well done but came out not crispy at all. Spent about $35 on my family but wished I didn't. The place possibly has some potential but definitely  lacking in the wow factor.",

The chili has a very unique flavor that is delicious, pair it with the lobster bun and its mouth watering. Garlic fries with the meal are a must and the dirty corn is very good as well. For those that are brace they have a bunch of custom hot sauces including Carolina Reaper Pepper sauce, and to try to tame the flames in your mouth the horchata ice cream is just the way to go. Overall this place is very good, but feels a little overpriced. Definitely worth a try if your in the southwest.",

The fries were ok, but I would have loved more seasoning. The only hotdog place in town I think is better than Dirt Dog is Buldogis. Dirt Dog has a very different flavor profile though, more south of the border flavors and that's good it makes them stand out. The food comes out hot and fast and the service is always friendly.",

I tried two other spots for elotes today and this by far was the best,3rd time is a charm. It is a clean restaurant and very spacious. They have the perfect person working the front. Forgot his name but he was a great guy!!!! Please please see photos, tho they don't do t justice and go here to eat some great food. Oh also had the chili fries bomb and the deep fried Twinkie and horchata ice cream. I mean damn..... just good.",

    "text": "Hot Diggity Dog! Delish! Straight from LA to LV is the newly opened Dirt Dog & they can make a delicious Hot Dog bursting with flavor. A Chicago dog was requested in the car so I immediately thought of trying this place out. No Chicago Dogs here though, instead we found hot dog choices with with unique toppings & flavors. I tried the Brown Dog which is a bacon wrapped hot dog topped with grilled onions & peppers in Teriyaki Sauce topped with Sesame Seeds & Bacon Bits. Yes, more bacon.... I got this dog in a lobster bun which is a buttered grilled bun like you would use for a lobster roll. The Red/Spicy Dog, Green Dog & Garlic Fries were also tried at my table. There's definitely an LA feel to this place especially with an LA radio station playing while you eat. The servers were friendly & attentive. I did mention that sprinkled salt on the fries would add flavor if you didnt want to dip your fries in the yummy garlic dip. It was also hot inside, I guess if the front door closed it would automatically lock so it was kept open for a bit. I'm sure they are working on that but in the Vegas Summer Heat doors must remain closed! Also I didnt know that every hot dog is wrapped in bacon. My server told me that I should've been told that while ordering. Knowing that this place just opened & keeping in mind that everyone is new & learning, I wasn't upset & obviously I don't mind bacon because I ordered a hot dog that has bacon bits on it. Yes, we will return & I will be spreading the word about Dirt Dog. Who's ready to get dirty????",

Co workers took me to this place for lunch figuring it would be quick. 3 of us ordered at the same time and only one of us got our food within 5 minutes. Myself and the other guy got part of our food 20-30 minutes after and still wasn't complete. Our last item that we had ordered didn't come out till 45 min after which by then we had only 15 minutes left before heading back to work so we asked if we can just get it to go. To make things worse 2 guys walked in just before we left and they received their complete meals within a few minutes. I'm not one to get upset but this experience really made me not want to ever set foot there again. Staff at times showed great customer service and engaged with customers but at times also looked confused and seemed as if they didn't have a set plan to get food out to the customers within a reasonable time.  Aside from that the food does taste great. I have no complaints there. Maybe I'll give it a shot at a different time & day and hopefully I can have a  all around great experience.   House dog, pepper fries and dirty corn all tasted amazing. Very flavorful!",

This is our third time coming here and it is very cool,  I always get very filled up as my wife and I usually each get a dog(veggie one for me) and fries but we added the esquite corn and it was a complete meal.  The best thing about Dirt Dog is they have a soy frank but they will cook it on a separate grill so you don't get any meat lingerings from other orders.  The music tonight was pumping and two different football games on so just I don't get what their target audience is but nonetheless,  You want good hot dogs and are on the westside of town,  you will not find better.

The atmosphere is great they even have games you can check out but I feel like the hotdogs fell kinda short. Maybe I just had high expectations from all the hype I saw on this place. I only been here once and the hotdog I tried is called the red dog, it was just ok. Let's just say I wouldn't travel across town for another one. Another thing that was a disappointment was the  corn on the cob, it had way too much lemon and not enough spice. I rather get it from a Mexican creamery or on the street from a elotero.",

    "text": "With all the hype and great reviews friends had of this place I was a little disappointed. First off the music was so loud we could barely hear the cashier.    The place was clean but seems like there are serious growing pains with pans and dishes piled in service windows. Now to the food. I had a brown dog and it was tasty but really salty!  I like salt but it was overkill. I also feel like my dog was over cooked, really chewy and tough.  Maybe it's the kind of meat, not really sure. Friends also ordered the garlic fries which in the menu picture looked amazing.  Too bad we didn't get that.  Our fries were greasy and had raw garlic thrown on top.  I love garlic but not raw!  I doubt I will go back.  I've crossed it off my list so no need to revisit.",

I ordered the dirty corn and the house dog and the hub ordered the green dog and dirty fries. The fries, corn and green dog was delicious but the house dog didn't deliver. I didn't even finish it, the ketchup, mustard and mayo(not listed on the menu in store but is shown online)overwhelmed the bacon thousand island sauce and peppers so I ordered a green dog and it was delicious. The parking is terrible and it could be kind of hard to find since it's in a crowded plaza and hidden in the very back. I think we'll definitely come back because there are plenty of options.",

    "text": "Ok first off what I make at home with the corn is way more similar to the real deal then this place. It lacked the spiciness and flair then the original corn from the streets. They turned a authentic food item into a washed out over priced thing. This place wasn't worth the hype and I'll be happy if I never return. I'd rather take my money to the grocery store to purchase the ingredients I'll need to make the corn the PROPER way and I'll more than likely be saving some money from doing so. The deserts weren't all that either. I was totally let down and I'm sorry but I just can't recommend this place and I can admit that I have no idea what other people who left positive comments about this place were even talking about at all....unless of course they haven't had the REAL DEAL! Save your money till you find the guy pushing a grocery cart with an ice chest Because this is what it's about! And by the way no guy I know of who has ever sold this corn has ever put bacon on it!!! That was a disgrace to what this corn is even about. Thanks but NO thanks!!! I'll stick to the real deal and my suggestion is for you to as well",

I'm ready to drop down on a knee and propose to y'all! Get your minds out the gutter!  Naw but for real though this is now my favorite hot dog place ever. I'm from the bay area so all my baydestrians know that there's nothing like top dog and then I lived in so cal for a minute and was faithful to dog haus but then dirt dog came in to my life thanks to a very high night while browsin Instagram &ish and I don't think I could ever go back to either joints. It'd feel like I'm cheating now. I have a very serious relationship with dirt dog now. They're menu is filled with  literally anything for anyone . They even had elote & beer! Igot that pastrami dog....boyyyyyyyyyyy everything about it was perfect I got it on a lobster bun too best. decision. of .my. life. I couldn't put that thing down and then I got some garlic fries and they were so fresh with actual garlic on them and enough spread throughout the entire fries so I wasn't sitting there with just some plain ass fries. Yes!!!! On point. I also got a churro and it came with horchata whip cream !!! Uhhhh I didn't even know that shit existed but let me tell you I'm glad it's blessed my life. Lol the customer service was so friendly and quick too plus you can check out board games if you're dining in so it's a very welcoming and chill environment. They also had fried Twinkies and Oreos that I didn't get to try out on my first visit...but like I said I'm in a committed relationship with dirt dog now so y'all know I'm coming back for my seconds and thirdssssss! Y'all definitely need to go check my bae out.",

The music was an array of 90's hip hop and the volume was perfect. All the food was outstanding, the highlight for me was the horchata ice cream, It's was amazingly savory. Be careful with the hot sauces as I unknowingly poured a healthy amount Trinidad scorpion sauce on my hotdog and then wondered why I couldn't stop coughing. xD Super hot, but satisfying experience for my hot tooth needs. Can't wait to return and try the tacos and more of their amazing street style cuisine.",

    "text": "My friend summed this up for me.. \"Dirt Dog was a basket of disappointment.\"  We'd eagerly planned our trip to Dirt Dog for weeks, looked at Instagram and Facebook videos, and had our mouths and taste buds all ready for some decadent deliciousness. But alas, it was not to be.   The line was long, but moved swiftly. You place your order at the counter and your food is delivered to your table. Service was pleasant and our food took about 10 min to arrive. Two of the dirty dogs and an order of filthy fries cost about $22.   Now, the food.. that's the disappointing part. My friend got the patty melt dog, I got the elote dog,and my boyfriend got the chili dog. We split an order of the filthy fries. The fries were definitely the best part of the meal. Covered with melted cheese, bacon bits, and guacamole, they were a treat. They weren't as hot as I'd like, but that was in part because of the cool guacamole on top.  The dogs though.. they were more like sad puppies. They weren't fully wrapped in bacon, and the lobster butter rolls definitely weren't buttery as promised. My dog had the most \"stuff\" on it, but it didn't really make sense- it just was a lot of corn that didn't really taste like anything , the cheese was overpowering in flavor, and the hot dog was WAY too salty. It just felt like a waste of calories and elevated blood pressure .  My friend was similarly disappointed by her patty melt dog. Not enough cheese and the bun was also not buttery and was dry. My boyfriend gave the chili dog another blah review.   Just felt meh all around and I won't be going out of my way to walk these dogs anytime soon.",

I arrived maybe around 8, with my brother and his son. We were going to meet friends to have dinner there and see how good it was finally. My brother has a infant so we tried to get a booth before ordering so the child wouldn't be fussy. I approached a worker cleaning a table near me. When I told him the booth was dirty and that we were just arriving with the baby, the guy rolled his eyes as if I asked him to give me some kind of special treatment. All I was asking is if the booth could be cleaned.  He then proceeded to clean, i thanked him, then he came back and told me of we weren't in line we couldn't get the booth despite having an infant.   There was no host to inform us we needed to order first and we didnt see any signs that made this a rule. I found it very rude and turned me off. So we left.   The reputation of this place was great but this situation is unreal. I work in hospitality on the strip and if we ever treated someone that way it wouldn't be accepted.   I hope to be able to try the food one day but as for now I think it needs to be known that infants and families may not be as welcomed. I was in complete shock and it literally turned me away.   I get we all have bad days or hard jobs. But that's no excuse to have such a bad attitude towards people who have nothing to do with you.",

Arrived here Friday night with the family and we ordered 2 kids meals, elote fries, dirty esquite (elote in a cup), dirty dog, green dog with fries and drinks. The bill came to about $40, which was a little pricey for just 2 hot dogs, 2 sides, and 2 kids meals, with 5 drinks.  Break down: Dirty Dog and Green Dog tasted very salty and not sure if that is how it is supposed to be or if the cook had a very off day. My wife and I couldn't continue with the punishment.  Dirty Esquite and elote fries was ok  kid's meal #1 mini corn dogs with fries and oreos - looks like Vienna sausages battered; was a hit, my son loved it  Kid's meal #2 chicken nuggets with fries and oreos.  My daughter said yuck to the chicken nuggets and will not order again.  All in I don't think I see myself driving back here a second time.  Thanks Dirt Dog, I love the atmosphere and the place looks great, but Yelp is about food and I don't see higher than two stars.",

It was tasty but a bit much for my basic taste buds.   I wish they had a mixture of fancy and regular options. The wait time is a bit lengthy but hey it's obviously a well put together dog so you can't rush it. I wouldn't recommend coming on a 20min lunch break.

I don't blame the employees who were obviously frustrated towards the people coming in 45 minutes before closing, because that's understandable, I blame management for allowing their schedules to end the same time the restaurant closes. If the restaurant closes at 11 pm, make the employees end their shift at 12 am or later  to ensure that the customers who come in at 10:30 or 5 minutes till close are not treated badly. And being that I'm from Los Angeles, it was unfortunately a disappointing experience.",

I love that they offer the elote cup in case you don't want to get a bunch of kernels stuck in your teeth. The tacos are on point as well! Carne asada, chicken tinga (more like grilled chicken, but still very good) are my usual go to's. There's soo much more I want to try but haven't gotten the chance yet. The horchata ice cream looks sooo yummy! Next time, for sure! Worth the trip every time!",

The customers standing in line to order food are literally blocking the entrance/exit door so getting in and out is a little more of a hassle than it should be.  Vegetarian options are available. We got the vegetarian hot dog with red sauce. The hot dog and everything on and around it was delicious. Tons of flavor and the spice level was up there so be sure to have a drink ready (coming from someone who loves spicy food).  I'm honestly not really a hot dog loving kind of guy but I did it for the yelp!! XD",

But instead I will talk about the churro :)  The churro is only $2 and it is fresh and crunchy and moist in the middle and has plenty of cinnamon sugar which is a must for churros and there is even lots at the bottom of the basket that you can pick up and keep making it rain goodness all over your churro . I personally like to take my time and continue to dress my churro up and make sure every bit is covered with the special dust so I never get a naked bite lol. And to top of the churro they send it out with a whipped cinnamon cream that kinda taste like horchata which just really puts the finishing touch on the churro. If you need a desert look no further and you also have the option to have a horchata ice cream to go with it or just add one of their fabulous horchata drinks which are rich and smooth",

    "text": "The selection of food looks really appealing. Going there for the first time it was hard to decide what to get. My husband and I made a choice for the House Dog and the Patty Melt Dog. We wanted to start there. If we still got hungry, we would look into the Corn and French Fries. While we waited on the food we found our seat at a booth. I hope they choose to get the seats replaced because they are ripped and gross looking. The Patty Melt was the one I had. It was pretty tasty. Once I got halfway done there was a shift. There became an overwhelming taste of lime, and the fact the entire wedge was sitting there, gave an overwhelming taste that came rushing at once. My husband's House Dog tasted real good and I think that's what I will have next time. If you cant handle the heat of these dogs though, I would skip it. They do have aiolis and condiments that really packs a punch.  Once we finished the dogs, we went back to try some fries and dessert. To keep it safe I just tried the Dirty Fries. I'm glad I did because that was better to handle, but I had to have regular ketchup as dipping sauce cause I am a whimp. I never had a Fried Oreo in my life, but I'm so glad I did! My husband just got vanilla ice cream and was just and good.   Overall this will be a good meal to have if you can handle the heat of what the food comes with. It's nice to experience a place that specializes in hot dogs. They also have board games to play making this place great for social gatherings. :)",

They offer a variety of different hot dog creations, fries deep fried desserts. Everything was delicious, the hot dogs were juicy, beefy and cooked just right. Fries were crispy and the Al Pastor meat was tender and paired perfect with the fries. We also enjoyed the Mexican street corn in a cup, you can get it in a hot dog or fries too. Can't wait to come back next time we are in town.",

I Saw my order was ready the moment I walked in but since there was 8 people in front of me the food was already cold. Spent over $15 bucks for a hot dog and fries. Maybe it would of been better if I ate it there. The service was long and there was people still waiting for their food when I left.",

    "text": "My husband,friend and I decided to come try these guys after a video was shared with us about their corn. We absolutely love elote and couldn't pass this up. Plus hotdogs and tacos? Score! We ordered dirty esquite, 4 carne asada tacos, 3 pastor tacos, 1 elote dog, 1 filthy fry, and a dirty elote and some drinks. My first issue was that the dirty elote (pretty much a traditional elote style corn) and one of the carne asada tacos never came. When we finally checked the receipt we realized the cashier hadn't charged us so my husband went back to order it and see how long it was going to be, he decided it wasn't worth the wait as he'd already finished his hot dog (not a huge deal since we weren't charged but my husband was bummed). The elote dog was pretty bland. I didn't really taste the corn over the beef flavor of the dog. The dirty esquite felt like they had just added a bunch of cotjia to a cup of corn and it was kind of dry. The tacos also didn't pack much flavor. They came with a wedge of lime and some red salsa that was kind of an average salsa. Now I will say the filthy fries were pretty good. They had guacamole, chipotle aioli, cotija, and some melted cheese. I really enjoyed the chipotle aioli and think they could've added that to the elote dog for a kick. The fries were all our favorites and agreed we'd eat them again but that the rest of the food wasn't worth the drive from centennial out to blue diamond. It wasn't a total bust for a one time trip. Overall we just felt a little rushed ordering and the cashier not hearing parts of the order was disappointing. The order also wasn't read back to us so we didn't realize the mistake. The tables had order numbers left and we couldn't tel which tables were taken and had trash left behind as well so we had to clean off a table for ourselves. I'd say try them but it didn't live up to the hype and the videos people shared with us.",

It truly was delicious - light and fluffy on the inside, and even the leftover was delicious the next day after warming it in the toaster. Unfortunately, I never got to taste the cream dip that was supposed to go with it. Kudos to the gal up front for being so very friendly and welcoming. And working the register and serving everyone is likely overwhelming. But she gave my order to the customer who came after me. I waited about 15 min for garlic fries and a churro, mind you. That customer luckily came back because we ordered different foods. But the dipping sauce I received..probably was meant for her hot dog and not my churro since it was a spicy dip. So...friendly place, some kinks to work out, but what new business doesn't have that.",

The brown dog was our favorite. All of the hotdogs were good, though. The only thing I didn't like was the cleanliness and wait time. There were a handful of people already in the restaurant when we arrived. They had already been served. It took a good 20 minutes just for our order to come out. I mean..its just hotdogs right? The floor and booths were covered in crumbs and food. We couldn't sit down without wiping everything down. When we were finished eating, we went to throw our trash away and there wasn't a trash can. We asked and they said they don't have one for us to throw food away. That's odd but whatever. I would say the best part was the dessert. We got the deep fried Oreos and the horchata churro. Both were amazing. So much so, that I would return just for dessert.  If you like hotdogs, definitely try.",

I had the house dog on the lobster roll.....don't waste the 50 cents extra....hubby had it on a regular roll and said it was extra good. The onions were barely cooked certainly not caramelized and I didn't have any bell peppers.....wrapped in bacon no but there were bacon bits.  Still it was very good. Now...I had the dirty chips and my husband had the (or tried to have) fries with cracked pepper.  The first food out was the hot dogs.  Then my chips came (they were over cooked and tasteless) and then, after talking to two waiters we got my husbands fries.....should have kept our mouth shut.....they weren't good at all.  Mind you we were 3/4 way thru our meal.  The manager came out and compensated the meal.  I hate that....it's like you complained in order to get free food.  She offered to give us free items when we came the next time, comp our meal, etc.  BUT never gave us a chance to talk it over.  My husband took the free meal.

I ordered  and I will not lie I was surprised at the size and the ability of the cooks to fashion this piece of art on a Texas toast bun. Literally, the food came out and my clothes came on. I was very aroused by my food. The ladies behind the counter warned me to put my clothing back in and so I obliged. Then enjoyed my delicious food. The hot dogs and their topping complimented one another how a Victoria secret models wings, panties, and bra compliment their bodies. As my food was demolished in by inch and the dogs and beer made their way down to my belly like George Washington attacking the British red coats. I was finished and satisfied. The sexy hot dogs had made their way down the runway and back. Residing now in my belly. Then came my deep fried Oreos with honey butter (I believe). I nearly fell out of my chair and offered my body as sacrifice to the aztec god quetzalcoatl. They made love to me orally and washed down elegantly. I will say I was spent after my indulgence here.

I like the fact that the dog itself is a premium dog and not just some run of the mill dog.  The bacon wrapping doesn't overwhelm the dog, rather it complements the overall flavor.  The fries were done well and the garlic wasn't overpowering.   Just the right amount of flavor.  The only reason you're not getting 5 stars is because you ran out of Twinkies!  :)  Took the fried Oreos instead and they were just fine.",

When we arrived the fries were sitting open and were obviously freezing cold. They agreed to make news ones, which took 10 whole minutes. We got back to the office an hour after leaving (so upsetting no time to eat lunch) and began to question if my bosses hot dog was really vegetarian. After a few more bites she conceded, it was meat. How disturbing for a vegetarian? I can only imagine. Not to mention my hotdog was spice level H-E Double Hockey Sticks on a scale of 1-10. I love spicy food but holy moly, this should come with a disclaimer. \"Hard to eat. Will cause tears.\" Any how. Bad experience overall. Fried Oreos were soggy. But maybe you will enjoy...",

THE SETTING: staff is friendly and the restaurant is very urban with lots of room to sit... be prepared for a little line to order, but didn't take to long to get our food.   OVER ALL: This place has great food but bring your big wallet because the average dog is $6/$7 and if you have a small army like I do the bill is easily over $50. I was upsold on the type of bun I got and wasn't told there would be a price difference between what's displayed in the picture and what it comes with.   Over all I give it 4 stars because I was upsold without being told the extra charge to have what was displayed  on the menu & I think it's a little pricy for a hotdog. Wouldn't take much to make this place 5 Stars...",

This year was no exception, met some great folks while eating my green dog and drinking my beer from Sin City brewery :)",

    "text": "Come to Vegas and skip this gem? Oh not on my watch! These were the best crafted hot dogs we have ever had in our lives. The flavors perfectly crafted. It's like having two in one greatnesses. The hotdogs are wrapped in bacon. We opted out because we don't eat pork. The dogs are 100% beef. They are grilled to perfection. I had the Mexican corn hotdog. OMG! It was served on a lobster roll. Everything was so fresh. My boyfriend had the chili pepper hotdog and then their regular dog. He got the guacamole on the side for me to have and it was actually fresh. His hotdogs were delicious. Dirt Dog also has the best fries in Vegas. I don't know what they add to them but they were literally the best that I had during my 4 days there. Honestly probably some of the best fries I've ever had. All in all Dirt Dog is a must have.",

In addition to the food here, the speed was excellent as well.  The restaurant had a very \"laid back\" atmosphere, especially with the staff, the decor, and the music. They really did their best at creating an \"LA\" style restaurant.",

Originally from Los Angeles, this place has that LA vibe, complete with South LA music, a little Snoop Dog, Tupac and Cube. There are several types of buns you can choose from for your dog, along with different toppings. I went with the toasted pretzel bun. We had to share the fries, the hot dogs are big! The corn came in a cup, (or you can have the traditional cob) and it had a mixture of butter, spices and cheese. Very delicious! I will be back! Nom!",

I was stuck between getting the elote dog, but ended up getting the dirty corn. Probably one of the best elotes I've ever had. You can taste the grill, and the corn was juicy, fresh and crisp. The flavors blend very well together. Also got the DUI fries and the pastrami reminded me of thick bacon. The pineapple fresca was also very delicious. Really good stuff here and I'm typically not a fan of hot dogs. Looking forward to coming back :)",

Dirt Dog is an LA-based franchise specialising in LA streetfood but has quickly made a home for itself in Las Vegas. They serve the most outrageous loaded hotdogs (and sides) you can think of that any 'dog fan like us would really appreciate. Our lunch visit saw the place packed, but since the crew are very efficient, the line just kept moving without a long off-putting wait. We decided to get the House Dog (beef hotdog, bacon thousand island, green chile spread), Elote Dog (topped with elote--corn, Mexican crema, cotija cheese, chili powder, cilantro and bacon bits), loaded Garlic Fries, loaded \"Dirty Corn\" (Mexican crema, cotija cheese, chili powder, cilantro, bacon bits) and a few drinks and we all came out very happy and satisfied with our meal. The hotdogs by itself was snappy, beefy without being too salty, it's sandwiched by butter-toasted buns and then piled on with goodness, messy dirty dogs, but so good. If you love fries and garlic, then this place has you covered as well. I'm sure we'll visit again and try out the other hotdog concoctions (and the tacos!) and then decide on a favorite!",

There are cards and board games you can play while you wait but considering how fast they move even when it was busy you won't have much time to kill.  Service-so friendly, so fast, table was vacated, cleared and wiped down within minutes while we waited to sit. And the place was full!  Each thing we finished was whisked away promptly and politely. I don't see service this terrific even at fancy restaurants. Super impressive.  Food - this is why the place was PACKED even at 3 pm on a Sunday. So so so great. I will crave this food. The filthy fries are delicious and, for those of us who don't eat beef hot dogs, they have a SOY-BASED HOT DOG you can swap out for the beef dog on any of their dishes. Amazing! Oh yeah, pretty good horchata too :) I will be back again and again. You can't go wrong here.",

It's a really chill spot you can hang out with the friends at to grab a quick bite or sit down and dine. It's on the smaller side but you could get a small group of friends in.  Then menu consist of different gourmet hotdog creations that seem to be themed around Mexican flavors. They also had different types of fries, elote, churros and draft beer.  All their hotdogs are all beef dogs wrapped in bacon with your choice of white bun, Portuguese or Texas toast.   I had the elote dog and it was pretty tasty. It had corn, lime, special sauce, cotija cheese, and few other things I can't remember.    All in all I thought it was pretty good! I would definitely go back!",

    "text": "This tiny nook is a bit of an Easter Egg hunt. It's located deep within the Grand Bazaar Shops of the Bally's Resort, across from Wahlburgers and next door to Fuel Bar and Sin City Brewing Co. You could walk right past it if you're not paying attention. The eminating french fry smell was what caught my attention and made me stop to look around, after which I spotted their hot dog display.  The place is so compact that it reminds me of a hole-in-the-wall I might find in New York City.    I decided to try their House Dog (first item on the menu) with a side of lime seasoned Dirty Fries. The hot dog was juicy and the bread--which was grilled to a light crust--was soft and warm. The fries were fresh and delicious, albeit a tad too salty (they could have dialed back the seasoning). The dog's chile spread (a combination of what appeared to be chipotle mayo, green and red peppers, bacon bits and onions) was tasty but very messy. Although every bite was pleasant, it was a struggle keeping my hands clean. The \"dirty\" namesake makes more sense now.  If you like hot dogs, are looking for something quick, or are in dire need of an alternative to the plethora of overhyped and overpriced restaurants in the area, then Dirt Dog is your answer. Hot dog, fries and bottled water... $13. That's a steal of a deal on the Vegas strip.",

We got the churro which was tasty ( I only got one bite because my children wanted it) but what completes it is the cinnamon whipped cream that it comes with. I definitely ate all of that with my finger. Next time I want to try the garlic fries and a street corn. They both looked and smelled amazing.",

The restaurant itself is a bit hidden if you're not familiar with the side of town. My sister and I drove all the way down from North Vegas to check this place off of our list. Smaller place, beers on draft, but they don't just have hot dogs. Their menu includes Tacos and \"Taco Fries\". I ordered their Brown Dog which had a sweet teriyaki sauce and a sesame aioli with onions, bell peppers and bacon bits. One added bonus is you get to choose the type of bread your jot dog goes on. If you're a fan of anything teriyaki this is your hot dog. Their dirty fries are dusted with chili limon and are addictive. My sister ordered the Patty Melt Dog and said I had to try it when we return. We were both pretty hungry, so there wasn't much sharing.   Service was nice and very polite. Our food came out quick. I noticed a stack of board games by the bar. Great place to just hang out with some friends have a snack and some laughs.",

The girl taking orders was taking drinks while she was taking my order. Then the line was long and one woman was just standing in the back, while another was cleaning tables. I understand that the tables do need to be clean, that is one  for sure. But again it's that no one helped bring the line down. I waited five minutes with just two people in front of me.  One hinge I absolutely hate about this place is the music. I absolutely don't mind the type of music, I love the 90s but it was too too loud. Is it that way because you he employees in the back want to hear it? It doesn't help me when I can't even hear he cashier or other person call me to place and grab my order.  I do appreciate that they were friendly, they did the generic greeting \"hi welcome to dirt dog\", and the \"have a great day\". But I don't see any thing special about this place.  My opinion is that I don't like blasting music playing when I'm trying to eat or order food. And that's me.",

I had to put ketchup and hot sauce on it for any flavor.  Everyone else who got the non veggie item said the same thing. All were dry with barely any sauce.  The \"cook\" had a weird awkward smirk on his face while making it and the vibe of the place seemed uncomfortable.  My bun also tasted burnt.  I ate half and put it down.  The dirty corn was AWESOME though I will say that and that's the ONLY reason why I will give it 2 stars was the corn.  Boring and dry for me and 3 other patrons having the same opinion. I don't see why this place has a high rating... maybe we came on a OFF night. Cooks seemed young and rude and the food was bland and dry.  Doubt I'll be back.  Maybe for the corn, and that's it.",

I was sort of expecting a grittier, younger version of Pinks hot dogs. I mean, they both originate in LA, they're hot dogs, kinda trendy hang out type spots, and each one has made a home in Vegas.  The Yelp reviews were good, pictures solid, menu I thought \"eh, not very extensive\" when compared to the OG Pink's.  When I arrived, I thought the vibe was great. Board games, a game on TV, west coast rap over the speakers. I ordered an Elote dog, the person I was with ordered a chili dog.  We had to wait 20 min, but didn't have anything better to do, so we happily sat around.  When we got our dogs, the first thing I noticed (and did NOT expect as a first timer) was that the dogs are enveloped in a Texas toast/hot dog bun hybrid.  Two of the thickest, most buttery, fresh and slightly toasted slices of Texas toast, but welded together towards the bottom to create this masterpiece of ingenuity.  The Hot dog by the way (it's a hot dog place, afterall) was INSANE. Way better than what we're getting at Pinks. Guaranteed.  The toppings on the Elote Dog. That's really a site and taste to behold. The perfect balance.  As I was eating my dog...... I was already deciding which other menu item I would get to next.  GO DIRT DOG and RIP to Pinks.",

This place is about a 30-35 minute drive across town for me & thankfully I can say it was completely worth it.   First off, the restaurant has such a cool vibe to it. The decor is nice, the staff is great & I loved the music; old school hip hop & some other music genres mixed in. Very open seating, so you don't feel cramped at all.   Now onto the food...Oh. My. Goodness! Everything we ate was amazing. We got 4 different dogs. The spicy one being my favorite but all delicious. The fries were crisp & cooked/flavored perfectly. Dessert did not disappoint at all! I loved the horchata ice cream & the portion size was perfect for my boyfriend & I to share. The homemade churros were soooo much better than your standard churro & it came with a great cream to dip it in that complimented the flavor well. Deep fried Oreos were awesome.   I will 100% be back again & the one thing I loved was that I didn't feel gross after all that food. Usually with hot dogs & sweets you feel heavy, bloated, greasy, etc & I felt great. I think that speaks to the quality of the food & the way it's cooked. Everyone must try this place!",

The servers are so friendly and give great suggestions. This was me and my families first time visiting and we don't regret it. The paintings are probably one of the best parts. Beautiful paintings are everywhere you look in this fantastic restaurant. I definitely recommend getting the Carne Asada fries, they were delicious. Also the Horchata ice cream and whipped cream were scrumptious! I definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a good time. Our server, Ryan was one of the best servers i've ever had. :)",

    "text": "I thought the food was alright. We ordered filthy fries, carne asada tacos, tacos al pastor, chicken tinga tacos, elote and their esquite as well. We also ordered 2 coronas, which didn't come with limes, so we had to ask for-however, we were only given 1 single lime. When we asked for more limes, they decided to bring another one-piece of lime-what a waste of labor and energy.  The fries were salty, but somehow they lacked in flavor. The tacos were alright, but they were not that good to die for- I personally liked the chicken tinga the most-as it was the most flavorful one. The elote was bomb actually though, and so were the esquites-even thugh they were a little too watery.   The complaint I had was about their service. Apparently, my friends who have previously visited this place mentioned their service was good and so were their food. However, the service on the night we went was just mediocre. The server was slow, and nowhere to be found when needed. Our table was not cleaned in time. The floors were dirty, and not a single bottle of sauces were refilled.   It is very conveniently located from my house, so I would definitely come back, but I wish they had table service in order to offer better service, or better service in general at least .",

    "text": "UGH. I wanted to love this place SO. BAD.   The good:  The customer service was outstanding. The cashier must list all the buns they have to every customer she helps all day everyday, but when I asked what types of buns they offered she was super patient and explained everything with a smile on her face. We were also approached a few times during our meal to see how everything was going and to clear any trash we had.   My order was delivered to my table super quick. I placed my number on my table, walked away to grab napkins, and when I returned it was at my table waiting for me.   The bad:  My food was cold. The hot dog had good components, and I feel like it would have been really good if it was hot, but I ordered the patty melt and the fries were cold and soggy. The bun was hot, but the inside of my hotdog was cold. The corn that I ordered was also pretty cold and seemed like it had been sitting in the back for a bit. The flavors were good, but I can't eat a cup of cold corn.  Five stars for the service, for sure. But the food today was meh. Next time I'm in Vegas, I'll definitely give it another shot though. I just wasn't impressed today.",

I ordered the elote dog, and the fried Twinkie.  The elote dog was very messy, and all the flavors on the hot dog were over powering and I couldn't find myself able to eat the whole thing in one go.  I would rather eat an elote, and have the hot dog on the side.  The dessert I got was very nice, what you would find at a fair basically.   My partner got the green dog, and I loved that one a lot more.  It tasted perfect and not over empowering at all.   The staff is very nice, the wait was a little long and there was no where to sit.  The place has games you can play, you can sit at tables or at table-bars.  We ate in the car though.  Overall, I would definitely go back/recommend, but I would not get the elote dog or recommend it to anyone else. I would go back to try something else.",

We both got chilli cheese hot dogs which included bacon and shared the \"Elote\" fries and... woah, it must have been the best hot dogs and fries we've had in our life! It was so good we immediately wanted to order more to go but decided to just keep going back if we get hungry later. It was the best and we can not wait to eat here again whenever we're in Vegas. I'm starting to salivate just thinking of how good those hot dogs are! Fantastic service and delicious food!",

From the time we entered the staff was nice, and did a great job explaining what makes them different. The food was the shining star, we had 2 different extra dirty dogs and split them and a side of dirty fries. Each dish was unique and very flavorful. We will definitely be back as this is a crave-able hot dog I can get behind :)",

The bacon around the dog idea has been around forever but their dogs are fat and the bacon seems to work better with a skinnier dog. Fries were decent hot and good tasting . Service was good and timely.  In my opinion they try to hard with to many flavors added, sometimes keeping it simple is better.",

This definitely won't be the last time we go here though so we have plenty of time to try everything  The people were super friendly. The atmosphere and music is super cool.

    "text": "Let's start off that these dirty dogs are delicious. Another level of satisfaction when it comes to gourmet hotdogs with a middle end price for it. I like to share that all of the selections do have a spicy level to each item. Other than they're delicious dirty dogs, you should try out their selection chili fries and desert. For my first time there, I had to try out the signature items along side the all time public favorites. I started off with a house dog and dirty chili dog which both had a spicy-chorizo chili taste, then shred a batch of filthy fries topped with guacamole, chipotle aioli, cheddar and cotija cheese. I finished off with their sweet Horchata ice cream with churro. That cinnamon blend really puts flavor into my tastebuds. I ordered deep fried Oreos for the kids and they only come in 2 pieces. It was not worth the price for just 2 pieces... The whole thing actually cost me a total of $35 which is pretty pricy but it's always worth the experience. You might even become a regular here. Overall I bet this would be a perfect spot to watch sport games if they added more tv screens all over. They already have an alcohol license and beer to complement their foods.  They accept card and I experienced great table service.",

Everything tasted amazing and was exactly as described. The churros were the best we ever had, as they're sweet and melt in your mouth. My favorite thing about this place, hands down, was the exceptional service. We felt immediately welcome and comfortable.  Will definitely be back again for our next hotdog fix.",

When I got there it was about 545 about an hour difference from my phone order! I ordered 4 hot dogs 2 fries and a dessert as well. When I got there 2 names stood out Nicole and Jayden. Jayden was the one who took my pick up order at the register. My food was supper cold and I was willing to take it and go. There was a bunch of traffic and and accident so my 10 mins turns into and hr. Nicole then came to me and said she apologizes for what happen and offered to have ALL OF MY FOOD REMADE do to the circumstances! I waited only about an additional literally about 5 mins and all my food was done and made fresh (HOT). Nicole sat at the register while redoing everything and talking with me ay the same time about your company and how she loves it. Nicole and Jayden both had impeccable service. I will defiantly be coming back. She also very knowledgeable on her beers as I work at BJ's and am the bartender to have someone like her be as knowelgebale is a plus in my book. Keep up the good work girls and DIRT DOG. your food was well with the extra 5 mins wait.",

Love love love the al pastor fries.  Wish i could bring home a bottle of the sauce they used.  My elote dog was messy but so fresh and tasty.  Cant wait to try more flavors.  The service was great, our cashier gave great recommendation of using the lobster bread (i could eat that on its own!) They were accomodating when they gave my husband extra chili when he said his chili dog didnt have enough and they continuosly checked on us.  My only critique would be I wish they had more seating options available.  We managed to get seating at the narrow table on the stools so i cant complain, but we saw many people arrive and leave because they could see there wasnt enough seating for their groups. I felt bad for them because these hot dogs and fries are Amazing! Also loved their horchata. Cannot wait to go back, but if there is not enough seating we'll be prepared to ask to take it to go.",

We had the House Dog, Brown Dog and Green Dog...they were all amazing. Very very flavorful and the buns were perfectly toasted (lobster bun was the best). The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is because the fries could have been better. The fries themselves were good, perfectly fried but if you are going to sale them as specific flavors, they better all taste different. We ordered the dirty, garlic and sea salt and pepper..they all tasted exactly the same. Other than that difinately a must try!",

First, i waited too long for a ONE hotdog take-out on a not so busy time. I was told i would be called if my order is ready but i had to follow it up. I could see it was ready because i was sitting on the table next to the cashier. Second, the waiter service needs improvement on attentiveness. My order was sitting on the counter while the waiter/waitress was chatting. And although the waiter was apologetic for the long wait which i appreciated, they would really look good in the customers' eyes if they would pay more attention to the wait time.",

The restaurant is spacious and clean, and there's a good amount of selection on the menu. I ordered the \"house\" dog aka \"the dirt dog\" which consisted of a beef dog wrapped in bacon (all their dogs are which is awesome!) topped with grilled onions and peppers cooked in thousand island sauce, letchu, mayo, mustard, and bacon bits! As far as the bun, you have a choice of 3, I chose the Portuguese which is a \"sweeter\" bun and the bun is laced with a green chile spread. Overall, it was a delicious dog! Probably one of the best I've had in a while. My friend ordered the \"red\" dog which was spicier -- and for those who aren't too used to spice, it definitely has a kick! My lips were burning a bit after tasting hers! Dirt dog is definitely a good spot to grab a quick and satisfying bite, so glad they brought one over from LA to Las Vegas. Also, shoutout to one of the chef's Cameron! Since business was a little slow when I went, he hooked it up with some free samples that weren't on the menu! From onion rings, to jalapeno poppers, and his own secret sauce!",

Chips were fresh hot fried, fries could have been thinner and crisper for my taste. Would be 5 star if they had just a couple more choices. A plain dog, and maybe something very cheddar cheese loaded.",

I will probably will be back but I'm not jumping in the car to go there again anytime soon.

Right when you walk in to the place a very nice girl greets you and asks if you have been there before. We told her no, so she gave us the run down of all the need to know's!    We tried a little bit of everything. Everything was really, really good! We didn't dine in because we were on the go, but we appreciate the way they packaged everything so well, including the corn on the stick.    I had the house dog and loved it. They are large, but still wish I would have ordered two even though I know, I would have been dying stuffed.   The chicken taco I ordered was on the smaller side, but I mostly came for the hot dog.  I regret not ordering the elote fries; next time.   Great atmosphere, great food, friendly service.  If you are from LA, or love LA, this is the place for you!

In comes Dirt Dog , a place my bro in law visited while he was down in LA. The reviews are superb, so why the hell not?   My fiance and I arrive to find a few people inside, rap/hip-hop music playing in the background and a smiling person up front to take our order.   We order the elote (with light cotija cheese) & the filthy fries. We attempted to order the horchata dessert (which looked damn delicious) but the clerk informed us that the churros weren't coming out right so they weren't going to sell those (which i appreciate cause I'm not trying to eat a wonky looking churro LOL).   When our order arrived, my fiance noticed that there were bacon bits on the filthy fries (even though that's not listed as an ingredient on the menu). There were also bacon bits on my elote which I hadn't noticed so I appreciate the lady who came running out to tell me after she found out we don't eat bacon. I'm happy that they were willing to make our order again - that too without any hesitation! :)   As for the food, I think it was a little cold but that's probably because we took it to go instead of eating it in.  I'll be back earlier next time to dine in though!   Customer Service = FIVE.  I'm docking a star because I think that something like bacon should be stated as an ingredient on the menu.   ...but that won't stop me from coming next time!",

Then their ketchup dispenser disappeared. So we asked for ketchup so my daughter had some with her fries and he told us it would be back out while they fill it. 10 mins past and she is patiently waiting to eat her fries with ketchup, ask again, and he says it will be right out. Now going on 30 minutes here and nothing! Soda doesn't work, ketchup not out. But what upsets me is that even with us asking, nothing was done.  I just don't like going places where they don't care. Good luck! Hope you get better service!  Update: I highly appreciate the quick response from the dirt dog lv location. I'm debating wether or not to return, but having someone reach out does show that the business as a whole, cares about their customers.",

Very downtown 90's LA with Tupac and similar paintings covering the walls. The music is great and really makes you feel like you stepped into another place in time. Their menu is extensive and everything looks amazing, I went for the patty melt dog and it was incredible. It was a little spicy for my taste but the quality was just over the moon. I would highly recommend switching your regular hot dog bun to their lobster roll that they toast over the stove, it really is good. This place is a 10/10 for me! An absolute must try.",

Everything in the store was nice and clean, and the women behind the counter greeted me with a smile. After looking around for a few and checking out the menu. I informed the young women that this was my first time here and asked if she had any recommendations. She offered everything on the menu, and then told me her two favorite items. She also informed me that all of their sausage dogs are wrapped in bacon and the lobster buns are her favorite (b/c they are more buttery and softer than the others). Once I placed my order I sat down and my food was out in no time.   The staff was friendly, the restaurant was clean and the food was good. If I am ever graving a yummy sausage dog again, I will defiantly return.",

We ended up ordering the Mutt Dog (red and green veggie dog), the cup of elite, dirty fries, vegan taco  and fried Oreos. So good! They even offered us free stouts. I think they were trying to get rid of the last bit of the beer stouts they had but one of them had a nice cinnamon flavor. I love the cool map on the wall along with all of the artwork! Will definitely come back. Great service! It looked like teenagers kept coming in even around 10:59pm (1 minute before closing). I personally would hate it if someone came into my workplace a minute before closing but they seen really accommodating and still served.",

Honestly, when she first said that she was going to have hot dogs catered I was not feeling it since I'm not a big hot dog fan! But no! I went in for seconds and the next day I decided to visit the place. Overall chill place, amazing friendly staff and the best food ! I had the house dog again with some spicy iguana sauce on the side and it was delicious! I've been here more than 10 times after the shower. So far I have tried everything on the menu and their food does not fail at all ! You will not be disappointed I guarantee. I recommended this place to all my friends and they all say the same.",

So, I found this place which is very similar and also serves VEGGIE DOGS!!!!!!! HAPPY VEGETARIAN DANCE!!!!! See, everybody's happy. So, we walk in and there's only one person ahead of us. Points for fast service!   Everything is reasonably priced. We ordered two hot dogs, a kids meal, a side of fries, and two drinks for $30. The fries are seasoned with some sort of witchcraft-y blend that is the perfect amount of salty and spice. Amazing. My fiance got the chili dog with a beef hot dog and said it was nothing short of spectacular. Apparently the lobster bun is also worth noting...... like 8 times. I ordered the \"brown dog\" with a veggie dog which was essentially a teriyaki stir fry on top of a veggie dog in a buttery soft bun! LORD IN HEAVEN. I cannot. The carbs. But so good. So, so good. We got the kids corn dogs for our 4 year old son and he  also gobbled that shit up.   Okay, suffice to say that the food is friggen awesome. The cashier was also super friendly and the service was fast! I have no complaints, only happy-warm-fuzzy \"I'm not even gonna eat dinner tonight because lunch was so good\" feelings. That is all.",

There was a long line went we walked in. The line moved relatively fast. I loved the giant menus on the walls. We knew what we wanted to order when it was our turn at the register.   I loved how they called my son's kids meal order to the chefs immediately....before I even gave my order. Smart! They understand the importance of getting kids food fast. Hungry kids tend not to be happy kids. I ordered a dog and grilled corn on the cob.   My son's meal come first. He loved everything. My corn on the cob came next. I kind of liked how they didn't wait to bring out the dog and the corn together. I can only eat one at a time anyway. And this way the dog wasn't cold when I was ready to dig into it.   I was thrown at the register when paying. It asks how much you want to tip. This was my first visit so I wasn't familiar with how the place was run. I tipped lower than usual as a result. Next time I'll be sure to tip much higher. The team does an amazing job constantly turning over tables, they serve the food fast and everyone has a great attitude. Everyone works hard, fast and happy.   We will definitely be back. That corn on the cob was amazing! The dog was good too.",

While hits from Ice Cube and Tupac are playing, you get to try to figure out what you want to pick out with their large digital menu. Getting the Dirty Chili Dog to go today. The lines do get long and parking can be tricky. The restaurant is tucked in the way back corner of a strip mall where a pet hospital and a big bar/lounge is, so I recommend just parking a little farther and just walking the rest of the way. Customer service is really nice and the murals of Tupac and Kobe Bryant adds to the atmosphere. They offer style tacos and a vegan taco too. The corn on the cob is Mexican street style with chili powder, slice of lime, and cotija cheese on top. Yum yum. They also serve some craft beers, horchata, and Jamaica drink. However, sometime they run out of things. Maybe because they are so busy? Like today they said they ran out if CO2 for their soda machine. Boo. And they ran out of horchata today. Either way, the place is still cool and the food is good. I'm sure they will work out some of these supply issues as they see how more popular they are getting. Come and get your Tupac and hot dog fix here!",

I can't wait till another one opens closer to my place & my job. Mean while I recommend this spot to anyone who loves street Tacos,  bacon wrapped dogs,  & elote. Fries are extremely creative as well. They serve beer & great deserts as well. Check them out,  you'll fall into foodporn luv.",

    "text": "2 hotdogs, fries, one cup of corn and drinks for $25. Meh  Got the chimichurri (green) dog and the house dog. Got the option of regular bun, Portuguese bun, and lobster bun (up charge). Tried the Portuguese and lobster bun. Find absolutely nothing special about the lobster bun. Portuguese bun was good. These dogs were okay, but nothing too special or interesting.   I am a lover of all things potato. And these potatoes were very disappointing. Tried the garlic fries and dirty chips. The garlic fries were like regular fries with some dried roasted garlic sprinkled on top. The chips were seasoned. Both were dry and lacked flavor...  The cup of corn... It was fresh grilled corn which was nice. Still lacked flavor.  Overall, seemed like a great idea but nothing quite delivered. Price seemed pricy for street style food.. I much prefer Buldogis for hot dogs with flare.  I went to this place hungry, and things should always taste better when you're hungry... And that didn't happen. The guy that helped us was very nice though.",

Also got a order of the Dirty Esquite...which I can never pass up in any situation, verrry good. All in all I can't help but recommend this place for a solid grub down and will definitely be back again.",

The first experience was fine - they were extremely busy but everything came out relatively quickly and together. HOWEVER, today it took over 30 minutes to get our whole order and it was not nearly as busy as the previous time I came. Not only that - it was brought out in numerous runs and therefore, some food got cold as we waited for the rest. When we confronted the staff, their solution was to just remove one of the items from our bill and refund us as we already paid. Needless to say, i was quite displeased with the customer service. I won't be dining in again as it isn't worth the hassle.",
