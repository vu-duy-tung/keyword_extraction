It is a quiet restaurant away from the flashing lights and constant dinging of the casino.  If you want a quiet delicious meal, this is the place to go.  Their breakfast buffet is amazing.  Fresh pastries, fresh fruit, delicious meats and much, much more.",

    "text": "We came here for brunch because it was convenient since we were staying at Mandalay Bay.  Verandah is located inside Four Seasons hotel and I must say I was definitely more impressed by the Four Seasons Hotel than this restaurant.  The service was a little slow and the waitress wasn't too friendly.  The food was good, but definitely well overpriced and nothing too special.  They had a limited selection of dishes for brunch and I kept reading about these delicious pancakes they make, but didn't see it on their menu.  I ended up ordering their organic roasted chicken with mushroom polenta cake (This was the tastiest item) grilled asparagus and tomato and tarragon broth.  The organic roasted chicken was good but only the dark meat as the white meat was well...dry.  My husband ordered their V Burger which is an 8oz. Black Angus Burger, Fried Egg, Caramelized Onion, Smoked Mozzarella, Apple Wood Smoked Bacon, Roasted Poblano Aioli, with Salt and Pepper waffle Fries.  Let's just say he very much liked the burger he ordered at The Burger Bar more.    Overall, the food was good, but not anything spectacular and certainly not worth it for the cost.",

We had just been seated & grabbed out first treats to enjoy ONLY to be told the brunch would close in 15 minutes & we needed to grab what we wanted immediately. Say WHAT? What didn't the 3 hostesses tell us that when we wee seated? I have never been so disappointed! What a rip off & not what I expected for a top end hotel.

    "text": "The Verandah is Four Season's version of a hotel cafe. It serves breakfast, lunch and dinner daily. I've eaten there for breakfast. The breakfast menu offers simple American favorites - pancakes, French toast, waffles, hash - plus a couple of ethnic dishes, such as huevos rancheros. Lunch gets a little more ambitious, and at dinner time the menu switches to an Italian theme.  **The Atmosphere Colors are mostly a range of browns, with lots of wood. Seating is available both indoors and outdoors; while I sat indoors, outdoor seating looked very nice. Overall, the atmosphere was pleasant and relaxed.  Service was friendly and efficient. I can't describe this very well, but I had a good feeling about the restaurant. Everything just worked smoothly.  **The Meal I chose an often recommend dish: corned beef and pastrami hash, two eggs, and crisp potatoes. It started out with a layer of finely shredded potatoes - actually more like thin spaghetti than shreds - fried crisp. Next, a thick layer of hash. Lastly, two eggs, any style; I chose scrambled.  The hash consisted of a thick layer of finely minced corned beef and pastrami. It was delicious; somehow I managed to finish the gargantuan portion. The crunchy potatoes shreds were an excellent foil to the smooth hash, although they were a challenge to get onto my fork. The only disappointing item was the eggs. They were overly firm and lacking in character. However, that's a minor quibble. I would recommend this dish to anyone.  I also ordered a latte. It came with a small biscuit that was a cross between pistachio biscotti and shortbread. Slightly sweet, it was a good foil to the coffee.  **Summary After only one meal, I'm ready to place The Verandah on my list of top breakfast spots. Its menu doesn't appeal to me as much as that at my top choice - Bouchon - and the overall feel of the place also isn't quite as inviting, but the combination of excellent food, good service, and pleasing atmosphere make it a winner.  **The Bill The meal was $21, plus tax and tip.",

At dinner, Chef Antonio features regional 3 course prix fixe specials from his native Italy. Ingredients are the highest and freshest quality, and there is a choice of two for each course. The latest visit was Liguria, featuring basil, Genoa salami. fresh peaches, balsamic vinegar. We tried both of each course, for optimal variety. Although portions appeared on the small side, this perception was deceptive. Each bite was a powerhouse of flavors, we were quite satisfied. We never had to leave the hotel for meals, a reflection of quality in this competitive restaurant town, rather than convenience or laziness.  The kids that I've witnessed have always been well-behaved, probably experienced and comfortable in the atmosphere of Four Seasons. It is not a family restaurant for unbehaved, noisy children.",

The dinner itself was nice, if a tad pricey, which is to be expected of The Four Seasons, I suppose.  The real star of the evening, though, was the drinks, particularly this drink called the Desert Rose that consisted of Belvedere Citrus vodka and hibiscus syrup.  Absolutely delicious and hands down, one of the best drinks I've ever had.  On an aside, I had written down the ingredients for the Desert Rose, but accidentally misplaced them.  I e-mailed the Four Seasons and within a few days, they had e-mailed me not only the ingredients, but the directions on how to make the drink.  This is stellar service and it was much appreciated.  While I probably wouldn't make this a regular place to visit for dinner, I could see coming here for drinks or special occasions.",

We waited to order breakfast... and waited.... and waited.... and waited some more. There were three tables in the restaurant other than ours. The servers had plenty of time to stand around chatting but apparently not enough time to take our breakfast order. We notified the management were were apologetic, which we appreciated. The server then came over and said \"Can I take your order?\" Seriously? No hello, how are you, good morning? Gee, thanks a lot. As a service industry professional, it really grinds my gears to see people who have great jobs at a semi fine-dining restaurant waste my time because they're lazy. I'm never coming back here. I will say that the hostesses and our beverage server were nice as well as the management so this is just a reflection on the wait staff. You are lucky to have a cushy gig. get it together!!!!",

The Verandah was ok. Although it is the Four Seasons, it was not as fancy as I had hoped.  It was very professional and we ate off china and used real silver spoons, the atmosphere felt like a restaurant rather than a parlor or Ritz Carlton (which no longer exists in Vegas).  The food was good, the tea selection was acceptable, and the service was good. Just lacking the ambiance.  It's not like the Titanic movie afternoon tea. Probably better off ordering a long island iced tea by the pool, after all this is Vegas..........",

I was wondering if I might of missed something because the food was about as good as a regular breakfast buffet at a sub-par venue.  The outside venue is nice but.... Maybe people don't get out much in Vegas because there are way better places to eat a brunch buffet.  The Buffet at Caesars and The Wicked Spoon at The Cosmopolitan are way better for around the same price.  There were five people in our party and one had a birthday and the total was $210.00 after tax and before tip.  My son said Mom you should gave me the $200.00 and went to eat at Sunrise Cafe.  Wow now I know how rich folks get taken advantage off.  I'll be eating at the other fore-mentioned buffets before I come back here.  One note I will say is that we could have just ordered of the menu and it would have probably been cheaper.  So I cannot review it as a regular restaurant FYI.",

Our waiter was fantastic, very personable and attentive. Menu is small, which I prefer, rather than poring over too many choices. Our mozzarella caprese appetizer was perfectly simple. I had the Cloud of Gnocci for dinner which, as the name indicates, was light and very tasty. I wouldn't recommend it if you are looking for a heavy big dish, but I loved it. Had the apple tart for dessert, which is beautiful and tasty. Didn't love the goat cheese crumble on it, but they didn't overwhelm the tart. It didn't actually have any pie crust, which I missed.

Adam Sandler movies as blockbusters. \"Harlem Shake\" as number 1 on the Billboard 100. And this restaurant getting 4 and 5 star reviews.  These are probably the same people getting snobby about buffets in other 5 star hotels. I admit, most buffets are forgettable culinary experiences, but this one takes it to a whole different level of bad.  I'll start mentioning I've stayed at the Four Seasons in the past and it is, in my opinion, the best hotel in Las Vegas, together with the Mandarin Oriental. Room decor is a bit outdated but I hear they're renovating so that's a good thing. No smelly casino floor to deal with, no crowds, all rooms are upper floors with a great view, and the most comfortable mattresses I've ever slept in. Great service. Worth the cost.   This restaurant is a whole different story though. For $50 per head we got a cheese \"station\" (a plate with a few different types of cheese, most of them looked unhealthy, as if they've been sitting there for days), a berry \"station\" (three small bowls, straw, black, and blue), a charcuterie \"station\" (once again, a small plate with three different cold cuts), an omelet station (typical omelet ingredients, nothing I haven't seen at any other buffet with an omelet station), pastries, a donut station, bagels that felt like a strange combination of leather and wood (chewy like leather when you bite into it but feels like wood when you touch it), scrambled eggs (runny, tasteless, awful), assorted small plates with mystery food (dry chunks of meat, what I think was quiche but tasted like cooked plain yogurt with microscopic ingredients, and other stuff so bad I don't even remember what it looked or tasted like), and smoked salmon (the only thing worth mentioning, good salmon).  Bottomless bloody marys? Sure, as long as you don't mind playing bartender. Clamato in a bucket with ice, bottle of vodka, tabasco, veggies, bacon, and make it your damn self if you please. I don't mind getting my own food at a buffet (it is a buffet after all), but making my own cocktail? At a $50/person buffet? You must be kidding me.  They get two stars because their servers are top-notch, but great service doesn't compensate enough for their lackluster food to warrant a higher rating.  I won't equate the setting (and it is a great looking restaurant) into the review because most upscale Vegas hotel buffets have magnificent design these days. It's the norm, so it's not even worth mentioning.  Truly disappointing.",

First off you get the choice of eating inside or outside Edith the lovely view of the pool. Second, you have the option of ordering from a menu or the brunch option. The menu has a lot of great breakfast items and lunch items as well. We opted for the brunch, which comes with coffee, tea, or juice. I had a strawberry and banana juice.  I loved it! Mimosas are offered for an additional $12. The buffet had fresh fruit, coffee breads, parfait, oatmeal, bread pudding, sausage, bacon, pancakes, bread pudding, French toast, quiche, and etc. What I liked the most were the freshly made donuts very yummy! You can also have eggs made to your perfection. If you want something that's not out the waiter can have it made for you. We had the chance to be waited on by Leo. He was very professional and friendly. He made our experience even more great when my friend asked for blue berry pancakes. Overall it was a great place to have brunch. It's not like these other buffets it's better! If you go to the Four Seasons make sure to valet in order to get your parking validated unless you like paying for parking. I'll shall return!",

    "text": "Sunday Brunch: Loved the breakfast panino! The seeds and nuts of the multigrain bread added a nice texture. The pesto made the flavors pop and made for a really nice autumn flavor profile.  The buffet had positives and negatives-- I loved the mini cinnamon rolls. Bread pudding had great flavors, but was a but underdone. Despite how beautiful and smart the Greek yogurt, fruit, granola parfait appeared, the granola was soggy and overall, the parfait was a bit dry. Unfortunately, The roasted potatoes were soggy as well. I heard that the mini donuts are amazing when piping hot off the station however, I didn't get to try them freshly fried, so those which I did try were quite standard and too sweet. Their fresh carrot melon juice was amazing! I Highly recommend trying their juices. The restaurant itself is quite lovely; bright and airy with high ceilings. We sat poolside which was very nice. Staff is very friendly and attentive. I would love to go back and try some of their other offerings. Cheers!",

To begin with, the brunch is open along with coffee and tea for $39 a person, which is very affordable in Las Vegas. The array of selection of items for brunch is wonderful. Everything from a continental breakfast of wonderful bagels and delicious pastries to a full buffet of salmon and vegetables to a full American breakfast selection of eggs and sausage and bacon and I can go on for a long time. There are really cool combinations of breakfast items and there is so much to choose from, all of which is delicious, that you have to come hungry. My friend and I were thoroughly impressed and have no hesitation about coming back. This is a great place for families and anyone that is hungry and looking for a diverse and fun brunch with great food. The coffee is delicious and the service is really good, with very friendly staff. This restaurant is a no-brainer for a great brunch.",

Luckily, I came right in time for Happy hour. Ordered the Ahi tuna cones $5, and I was presented with 2 very tiny and cute sesame ice cream cones filled soy sauce infused ahi tuna. Nice presentation. Then I got the beef sweet truffle slider $5 for 1 slider; the patty was overcooked and the truffle was too sweet and overpowered everything else inside the slider. Probably will not order that again. For my main entree, I got the braised short rib and that was absolutely delicious. I finished everything under 5 min, and was polishing the plate.   Service was good, I sat by the bar and the bartender was super skilled and talented. I watched him make all sorts of fancy schmancy concoctions and watched people's faces lit up after sipping his creations. It was very entertaining.   I would definitely like to come back and try some of the other options on the menu.",

Upon arriving at the restaurant we waited momentarily as the host had left his stand to seat he guests prior to us. After a moment we were treated by the executive chef who happened to be passing by and noticed us standing there. What a nice gesture! He was under no obligation to greet us and attempt to have us seated, but he chose to do so and it started our evening off on such a high note after our disappointing start earlier that evening.   Once we were seated we were met by our absolutely phenomenal waiter (his name escapes me right now, but he was an older Italian gentleman with a wonderful personality and kind demeanor). His suggestions were on par and the food was outstanding. The meatball appetizer was out of this world and my lobster risotto was to die for!   Thank y'all so much for turning a bad evening into a great one. Your hospitality, environment, wait staff and food selection was the best I had during my trip. Rest assured I'll be sending all my friends who visit to y'all's place!!",

    "text": "Let me start off by saying I was expecting more from Verandah at the Four Seasons.  When the hostess was walking us to our table, I noticed mini donuts sitting out and asked the hostess what they are for. She said they are for our guests and you can take one. I took two mini glazed donuts, even though, I did not like the fact that they were sitting out. It looked tacky and for The Four Seasons I expected a classier way of serving them like having them on a tray with serving tongs or keeping them in the back and having the waiter or hostess ask if we would like complimentary mini donuts.   As soon as I sat down at the table outside I noticed it was dirty. There was a sticky red substance on the table and crumbs all over the table, chairs, and the surrounding floor. For the prices that they charge here, attention to detail can not be overlooked. While looking over the menu, I asked the waiter to bring over some bread and balsamic. The balsamic was low quality and tasted very bitter, the container looked like it had not been cleaned for quite a while and was just refilled before the first shift of the day. I decided on the summer spaghetti and my friend chose the Tuscan chicken salad.   25 minutes later our food had not come out and it was hot as hell outside so we asked to be moved to the inside. As soon as we sat down we noticed it was just as dirty inside as it was outside. The table next to us had dried food particles on the side of it, booths were falling apart, and dust was all in the crevices.   Summer spaghetti- not well seasoned had to add salt, crushed red peppers, Parmesan to make it passable  Chicken salad- lettuce tasted like paper towels, ingredients were low quality  I called over the manager to tell him how filthy the restaurant was and that my expectations were not being met. He proceeded to write everything down on a note pad and thanked me for my feedback. I ended up sending the chicken salad back and we shared the pasta. The manager sent over a few complimentary desserts- Nutella cupcake, cherries, Panna cotta with kiwi gelatin on top? Both the Nutella cupcake and Panna cotta were amateur. The cake part of the cupcake tasted worse than a store bought mix and the Nutella buttercream frosting was lacking any type of bold flavor. The cherries were not even good, I felt like the manager just threw together a dessert without thinking it through.   When the bill came I noticed I was charged for the chicken salad. I told the waiter I should not be charged for an item I didn't eat. The manager comes back out and says you ate half the salad, and I said we tried the salad and realized it was not up to par. He ended up comping the meal for our sub par experience.  I hope to see improvement after the remodel is done because this restaurant needs to be refreshed and professionally detailed.   I appreciated the manager comping the meal and bringing out a few desserts. However, after the lack of attention to detail at Verandah, The Four Seasons in Las Vegas is not what it's cracked up to be.",

The Four Seasons hotel is connected by hallways to the Mandalay complex and within one min I was seated and served.  I started with the Caprese salad - lovely Heirloom Tomatoes, Campania Buffalo Mozzarella, Pesto a drizzle of olive oil. For my entree I chose the starter (I do that sometimes - I love Apps!) Sicilian Meatballs - San Marzano Tomato Sauce, Pecorino Romano. Perfect lunch!  Accompanying lunch I had the Chianti Colli Senesi and I also asked for olives and was given a lovely dishful to go with my rustic bread with olive oil. I wish they had a snooty cheese plat or a charcuterie - olive, meats, & cheeses with a salad is a perfect meal IMHO.  Interestingly, they asked me for my last name when being seated and from then on from hostess, waiter, bus boy, to the manager coming by to ask how things were - they addressed me by name ....what a lovely touch!  Everyone helps and serves just seamlessly! A lovely, relaxing experience, and so filling I didn't need a dinner!",

    "text": "I stayed here for four days, and used the American Express Fine Hotels & Resorts reservation program, so I got free breakfast each day. The service was good, and the food was nicely prepared. For breakfast, I stuck with \"The American\" -- eggs, sausage or bacon, hash browns, and a fruit plate to split. I did notice that they have avocado on toast, which I found funny since my mom made that ages ago when I was a kid. Being English, she always made beans on toast and sardines on toast. When we moved to San Diego, it became avocado on toast (she even made Spaghettios on toast). Back then, I never saw avocado on toast at any restaurants. Now I see it everywhere. Veranda's version has a fried egg on top. Everything is better with an egg on top. On weekends they have a small buffet brunch, which is about $40 a head. I gave it a try and thought it nicely done. I also had lunch there one day, and just got a bunch of appetizers to share and then had a roasted beet salad with the typical ingredients. The only annoying thing was when a waitress had a 10 minute conversation with the next table over, her backside was almost on our table and she kept flipping her ponytail when she spoke. She was close enough that it could almost hit my face (we were seated inside and the tables are close together). I was going to say something, but didn't. However, all in all I like this place and would go back. Oh, and a big plus is that it's not in a noisy, smoky casino.",

So yeah I decided upon carrot juice which I was bummed didn't seem to be all you can drink, but it was definitely good none the less..I had scrambled eggs, bacon, and hash browns for the main attraction..I mean yeah nothing special to gawk  over, but at least it wasn't over or under cooked and it seemed like they are pro health so who am I to diss that?",

The highlight was easily the chicken apple sausage, the freshly made doughnuts, fried chicken and waffle and french toast.   The standard fruits and cured meats, parfaits and yogurts were awesome too. If they wanted to kick up the quality of the cheese selection,  I'd like to suggest brining in Beecher's Flagship cheese from Seattle. Pair this with the cured meats... That would take it to another level, IMO.  There were 12 of us and we were all really happy with the food. The service was why only 4 stars was given. Took awhile to get someone to refill our drinks. At one point, I even had to search for a server to get refills. If they can tighten that up, they would get that 5th star for sure.  I do plan on returning, for sure and I am looking forward to that for sure!",

Had a great table right by the pool, comfy chairs at a round table that seated 7. The waiters were fantastic and we always had at least two ready to help us. I had the omelet with extra bacon which was delicious. Great mimosa and the Italian Screwdriver was interesting, although a bit sweet for my taste. Others at the table had the bloody mary and were going on and on about how great it was so I assume it was delicious, but I'm not a big bloody mary drinker. It took a while for the food to get to me because I ordered early with three of our friends, and then the other four came about 10-15 minutes after us. Even though we asked for our food to be brought when it was ready they still brought out all the food together. I won't ding them for that, we did kind of feel bad about possibly eating before our friends.   Overall, it was a beautiful location, delicious food, and a great experience!",

Scramble eggs, bacon, hash browns, toast, and two cokes. The bill = $70.00...grant it I did not look at the prices but $70.00 for a basic breakfast, never again. I don't mind paying for great food but not for basic. This review is obviously based on breakfast only but if they're charging that much for low quality I can't imagine what dinner would be like.",

    "text": "I came here with my husband and another couple after reading fantastic yelp reviews.  What the yelp reviews hadn't made clear (at least among the ones I read) was that the brunch buffet they do is only on weekends.  It says it on Verandah's website; I'm just an idiot.  And I'd been looking forward to a fancy tasty buffet, so other Yelpers, be forewarned!    So instead we had lunch.  I had the nicoise salad, and my husband had the ABC pizza.  Both were pretty incredible, but I think I mourned not having the brunch option the whole meal.    I have to return.  Besides being a really beautiful, chill environment, just venturing into the Four Seasons was an experience in and of itself.  We'd never stopped by before, and it was such a breath of fresh air (literally!) to enter a hotel on LV Blvd that was non-smoking, beautiful without being Vegas-gaudy, and allowed pets.  We had a blast watching people taking their dogs out and parading them through the lobby while we waited for our friends.  Everything about Verandah and the Four Seasons feels so un-Vegas...and that's part of why it's fantastic.",

    "text": "Mismanaged expectations.  From a promotion for a the prix fixe dinner, we dressed appropriately for \"The Four Seasons\" - and what a mistake!  The Verandah is a \"dolled-up\" buffet room, that's probably great for patio dining by the pool, but hardly for dinner.  While the wait staff was friendly and attentive, the service was out of step and not up to \"The Four Seasons\" standards.  After being asked for our water order (we chose Pellegrino), bread was dropped off unceremoniously without any suggestion of butter.  We guess 'everyone' prefers olive oil.  The bread was not at all warm - merely room temperature and poorly presented.  When the butter was delivered - a really long wait - over 5 minutes - it arrived cold and hard - straight from the fridge.  Off to a bad start.  The first course was a warm ricotta cheese with tomato - quite pleasant.  By now the sparkling wine included with the meal was delivered and acceptable.  The second course was supposed to be a seafood gnocchi but tasted like grammar school paste.  Huge miss!  Third course was 'snapper' (hard to tell) with whipped potato - not bad, but this is a $100 place setting.  Fourth course was short rib with polenta - very so-so.  The desert course was an 'ok' mouse cake with a dollop of ice cream, topped off with coffee.  The entire expereince just felt very \"regular\".  Here's the juicy bit.  My wife and I dress up for dinner about once a month as a treat.  On this evening, she wore a stunning dress and her best Jimmy Choo pumps - absolutely smashing!  While we wear jeans and shorts when appropriate - we're the last people would call snobs - we were really put off by the fellow at the next table in a \"wife beater\" T-shirt.  Where's the dress code for The Four Seasons during the dinner hour?  We've not tried the Charlie Palmer steak house adjacent to The Verandah, but doubt a visit any time soon.  Perhaps that's the hierarchy of dining at this hotel - The Verandah for the pool crowd.  With so many terrific alternatives on and off The Strip, The Verandah is relinquished to the back water.",

We were comfortably sat at a round table that fit our group of 6 perfectly. Close enough to the pool but far enough away that you're not getting splashed. So what makes the Verandah Sunday brunch amazing, everything is miniature.   What do I mean by miniature. Well, first off - don't even bother getting the a la carte menu. I'm sure its good, but you want the buffet. Trust me. But you never eat enough to pay for how much a buffet costs? I know, that's me too. This one is worth it.  Every lil food option is shrunk down so that you can try EVERYTHING and not be full. All of the meats, breads, fruits, yogurt, everything is in these little tasters so that you really can have everything. The in house homemade peanut butter is to die for as is the donuts being rolled right in front of you.   Our waitress was wonderful. We didn't even want any champagne after the weekend we'd had and she was so on the ball with coffee and tea refills. Wonderful! Thank you Verandah and the Four Seasons for a wonderful end to a great weekend!",

The buffet was smaller than we would have expected.  The brunch consisted of mainly breakfast foods (eggs, bacon, sausage, potatoes, french toast, pancakes, etc.).  We were hoping for some seafood and were disappointed that there was none.  The place did serve a variety of pastries which were delicious.  The service was slow.  The pool was under construction so there was no view of the pool area.   Overall the food was good and the service was fair.  I am only giving three stars since this was a Four Seasons buffet and therefore expectations were high.",

When we walked in the hostess was on the telephone assisting a guest. The guest was being quite inquisitive and the hostess was doing her best at answering them. I could tell she was trying to end the call to seat us, but try as she may, she could not end the call. We stood there for about 3-4 minutes when one of the waiters came to seat us. We looked over the menu and ordered the chicken and waffles and eggs Benedict. The service was excellent, as expected.   Our food came out perfect and looked delicious. It was, of course!  The only thing that I could say, was the chicken was over-breaded.  There was more breading than chicken. I'm sure some people like that, but not us.   If you're staying at the Mandalay Bay, this is the place for breakfast. It might be a bit pricier than other restaurants in the hotel, but it is definitely worth it!   I'll be back in a few months!!

Veranda is out of the way, tucked away inside the Four Seasons Hotel at Mandalay Bay.  This is a good restaurant, but one that may not be worth going out of your way for.  Highlights: Desert was great! Best Cannolis I've had since Mike's Pastry and other spots in the North End of Boston.  Comes with three cannolis (Chocolate, Nutella and Pistachio).  Mini Eskimos were also good (chocolate ice cream pops)  Ordered (party of two): Sicilian Meatballs (San Marzano Tomato Sauce, Pecorino) Beet Carpaccio (Roasted Sugar Beets & Ricotta, Citrus Rainbow Carrots, Candied Hazelnuts, Passion Fruit Vinaigrette) Tagliatelle ai Porcini - Hand Made Tagliatelle, Porcini Mushroom, Italian Sausage, Lemon Thyme, Castelmagno Cheese Rigatoni Bolognese (Rigatoni with meat bolognese and parmesan foam) Cannoli (Sicilian Pistachio, Nutella, Chocolate Chip) Mini Eskimos (Sea Salt Caramel Ice Cream Bars, Roasted Nuts, Bittersweet Chocolate)  Overall: Good Italian restaurant, but with so many other great Italian options I would not recommend.  Maybe for desert :)",

It went down hill from there. No introduction. No list of specials. No checking on us. Random people brought us our food. We had to flag down people if we wanted water or heaven forbid, more wine. Who was our waiter? Why would we ever come back? And the place not full. My stomach hurts too. What was in that food?!",

They have all of the breakfast buffet standards with many new takes and options. Every berry, bacon strip brioche looked and tasted like it was lovingly prepared and selected. The staff were friendly and so accommodating. My friend is vegan and the chef came out and spoke with her and - I shit you not- created a vegan mini buffet for her comprised of a tofu & veggie omelet, almond milk and chia pudding, avocado toast on freshly baked vegan bread. And, they only charged her for the avocado toast on the menu. Vegan friendly! I ate from the buffet. My favorites were the brioche French toast, the breakfast pizza, the mini Mexican tortilla, cheese & chicken skillet, the scones, the strawberry pancakes, the frittata, the fresh donuts, and the diy chicken waffles. Even the coffee and juice were delicious. We can't wait to come back!",

I was here with a group of about 10 people and they were able to seat us in a semi private area which was cool.  I ordered the Meatballs as appetizers. They were quite large and filling. I did them find them a bit salty for my palate.  My main was the Bigoli scampi. Now since I already stuffed myself with the meatballs, I was dreading a huge plate as my entree. Luckily the portion was \"human\" so I was able to eat it without leaving most of it behind.   Hot Chocolate Souffle was a winner amongst everyone.   Not sure I would come back. Food was decent. My friends were staying here and did not want to travel far so it was a nearby option for decent food.",

I believe you have to make a reservation for tea. When we arrived they already had our table specially set up. There's a great selection of tea- I had the mountain berry, which is like a hibiscus (so slightly tart and sour) and packed with vitamin C.   The food was also fantastic. The scones are the best ones I've had-- super light and fluffy. They make one plain and one with currants, and is accompanied with THE best cream. I surprisingly liked all the sandwiches, and I think the biggest difference was the quality of the bread and the fact that the sandwiches were not dry. Desserts were a nice mix and not overly sweet.  The best tea for me in Vegas would be the food here with Mandarin Oriental's view!",

    "text": "This review is for dinner at the Veranda.  I've only had breakfast or brunch here.  The restaurant ran a Black Friday special.  Call on Black Friday, make a reservation for dinner some night in December, and receive 50% off.  That's a great deal!  I had a reservation for 6.  There was only one other table occupied when I arrived but it soon got busy.  My server was Jose and he proved., along with all the staff, to be pleasant, polite, and very efficient!  I ordered 4 things--pear salad, ahi tuna crudo, Penne Tegame, and an apple and fig crostata for dessert.  First I was brought water and quickly the iced tea I ordered.    The starter was the pear salad.  Their menu describes it as Bartlet Poached Pear, Spiced Goat Cheese, Endive, Pecans, Porto Dressing.  It was excellent.  The pieces of pear in the endive leaves with the goat cheese was an amazing combination.  The pecans added a texture element that was perfect.  Next up was the crudo of very thinly sliced ahi tuna with balsamic soy dressing and guacamole. An interesting combination with ahi tuna but it worked very well.  For the main course, I bypassed the signature pasta dish and instead went with the penne Tegame with a spicy Roma tomato and parsley sauce and mozzarella.  The red flecks of pepper could be seen and tasted throughout the dish.  The spiciness was not overwhelming for anyone.  It was excellent.  Jose suggested the cannoli for dessert but I chose something different, the warm apple and fig crostata.  It had an orange and vanilla bean reduction/panna cotta gelato.  I am generally not a fan of warm desserts but this was amazing!  Very delicious and an excellent ending to a delightful meal.  Service was the best!  My iced tea never got more than an inch down from the top when the glass was refilled.  Plates were removed quickly, and people addressed me by my last name taken from the reservation.  This is what I expect from a Four Seasons restaurant and they didn't fail.  In addition, I received a phone call on the way home because they thought they had found an item I may have left behind.  They were in error, but it shows the detail to service that's paired with great food.  I'll be coming back for that signature pasta dish.  I have to check it out!",

I finally decided on the brunch because it was just a deal when juice and coffee is included and they will make whatever juice you want as long as they have the fruits. Even though the brunch does not have an omelet station but the kitchen will make whatever omelet you want and it is included in the brunch price.

    "text": "Had reservations for 7am on a Tuesday morning.  So unnecessary!  :)  Got lost trying to find the restaurant between three hotels in one at Mandalay Bay.  The service was friendly and superb.  Sitting outside was beautiful, comfortable and relaxing.  The menu is very expensive.  $5.50 for coffee, $6 for a wine glass size of juice.  About $18 for the average breakfast plate.  I ordered the vegetarian hash which was okay.  Asked for asparagus instead of spinach which I was pleased withm  The daily fresh squeezed juice was peach & passionfruit.  Just okay.  My hubby had corned beef & pastrami hash.  He liked it.  It looked okay.  A big plus is the gluten free menu items and the gluten free toast with breakfast!",

Shared at our table for two, bread with EVOO and bottled water, caprese, beet salad, field greens, ahi tuna steak, top sirloin, salted carmel chocolate eskimo bars, espresso.  Maybe sounds not so special, but each and every element of every dish was pure and distinctly rich in natural flavor, clean, and very high quality.  Excellent service, outdoor seating, warm desert breeze.  The only downer:  loud junky static broadcasting from Mandalay Bay stage next door... Can't call it \"music.\"",

    "text": "Veranda is one of are favorite go to Sunday brunch places. The quality is great for those items that are our favorites:  smoked salmon, cream cheese, onions and bagel to start for my husband and he finishes the brunch with freshly made mini donuts and blintzes.  I mainly go for my usual fresh crabmeat egg white omelette prepared on request with their regular pork sausage link and chicken-Apple links. There are other items to choose from, including juices, Bloody Mary's and Mimosas if you'd like. These are from the brunch buffet, but they also have a menu if you rather have it ordered. It has a sophisticated atmosphere with superb service that is second to none. We have tried many other brunches in Las Vegas, but Veranda is the one we enjoy about once a month.  So far it's always as anticipated.",

We were about ten minutes late (sorry about that by the way, some people in my party, not myself, are incapable of being on time.) but they didn't hassle us about it and graciously sat us right away. Our server was polite and explained our tea choices and then the little pastry and sandwich tray when it came out. My favorites were the currant scone and the strawberry pastry, but everything was delicious.  I thought the hotel itself was beautiful and we would have liked to walk around the patio areas but there was a severe dust storm at the time. I'd consider going again the next time I'm in Vegas just for the ambiance and the wonderful service, even the bussers were outstanding. Thanks again Veranda.",

    "text": "Review is for 2012 Restaurant Week.  Verandah is located in the Four Seasons Hotel and I remember my first visit here to the hotel, I was confused as heck on where to park, either you valet or do what I did and park in the large lot south of the entrance and walk on the roadway in.    Verandah was dimly lit and had a nice cozy atmosphere.  There were numerous tables, private rooms, and booths.  But we were sat against the window wall where you couldn't really see the outside because it was getting dark.  But you can see the private pool surrounded by green forestry, would probably be nice to sit out there and dine.  The service was good, server was attentive but the restaurant wasn't busy yet and the food runner knocked our socks off.  I lost all my pictures on my phone so I'm relying on the blurry dishes opposite of my foodie buddy Angela T's uploaded photos since we came here for restaurant week.    On paper the menu looked outstanding, worthy of the $50.12 price marked.  And compared to the other items offered at other places for the same mark I thought Verandah played it too conservative with such high level of culinary technique.  The drink I ordered didn't impress but the server did replace it.    The best food runner ever, not because he was Hawaiian, came out with a complimentary appetizer.  The soup and spoon sides were great.  The first course came out and mine beat Angela's.  I tasted her risotto because I love risotto and it was ahh maybe cooked a little bit longer than needed.  I think argula is one of the better tasting greens out there, the flower is even better but it was fresh.  My first course was a scallop, jumbo shrimp, and can't remember the third item but it was placed on top of a nice sauce and topped with a delicious flavor foam.  The spoon had a sweet fruit taste which completely refreshed my palette.  The runner told me it was to be eaten in one direction to the other.  The second course was what caught my attention and what brought me here.  This dish was so plain.  The monkfish itself was prepared perfectly though so there really was no hating it but there really was no way of loving it also.  I ordered the other dessert just so we could split it and try the others dessert and to me they both ended up being ordinary as well.  For me two of the three courses was just so plain, my appetizer was great though.  There were some great skills used when preparing our Restaurant Week courses and I appreciate the participation otherwise I would have never come here for dinner.  Culinary skills and mix of flavor to me outshined the bland main course, the complimentary appetizer was appreciated as well and our food runner was on top of every ingredient and knowledge into  how each dish was created.  I thought he was our chef with the way he explained each item as he delivered it to us.",

    "text": "Our anniversary dinner lead us back to Verandah and basically it just boils down to the fact that I love Verandah. The setting isn't very formal and there's an outdoor seating area with ceiling fans and shade for those that want to hang outside.   We changed things up by ordering the calamari (fritto misto). A good choice as there was shrimp/calamari and green peppers which brought it some heat. I looked back at my previous review and my significant other ordered the same thing as he did last year. The Brasato Barolo (short ribs) which is a definitely a MUST try... very flavorful, melts in your mouth deliciousness. I decided to get the rack of lamb which was good, nothing extraordinary....a lil bit over done for the \"medium\" that it was supposed to be but I think I could pass it up next time. The best dish of the night was Antonio's Pasta. It was cooked in the glass jar shown in pictures with scallops, shrimp and the best fresh pasta ever! The flavors were just wonderful and I could have just had that for dinner and been content. We ended it with a wonderful chocolate souffle that wasn't overly sweet and paired well with the dolce latte flavored gelato. They also surprised us with a plate of truffles and a Happy Anniversary written on it....sweet touch to a great night.  Verandah's service has always been and still is attentive. Delicious food paired with great service makes it for a great night. They also know how to make a lemon drop martini like how this gal likes it....bonus points there since I've been highly dissatisfied with a lot of lemon drop martinis at other venues. I definitely will be back for more short ribs, etc.",

    "text": "My wife was here on business and the only two meals we took together were breakfast in the Veranda.  One day the buffet was set up, and it looked like it was very nice and had a lot of unusual items, but we don't eat enough any more to justify the \"investment\".  I had the corned beef & pastrami hash browns, which was very good and a bit unusual in that the hash was more like very tiny french fries.  It was much better than Carnegie Deli's (in LV or NYC), and reminded me more of how good the pastrami hash at Stage Deli used to be, although it's not the same, of course.  My wife had the tiramisu croissant, which was very good but is more like a dessert than breakfast.  We ate inside that morning, and the service was very good.  A couple of days later, we had breakfast outside, and it seems to take a while to get the waiter's attention and he was nowhere to be found a couple of times when we had a request.  My wife had the quinoa and muesle (or similar), and didn't expect the quinoa to be cold.  That was a bit unusual.  I had the eggs Benedict, which was quite good, but didn't come with toast or any other sides, which seems unusual as well.  My wife had coffee both days, and didn't remark one way or the other upon it.  I had herbal tea, as my metabolism can't tolerate caffeine, and for both of us there were pots placed on the table for us to refill from.  We didn't have the opportunity to try any other meals here, but we will if we stay at the Four Seasons again.",

If you're willing to spend a grip of money for a fancy brunch then visit Verandah at The Four Seasons hotel: $39 per person & there's an additional charge to include the Bloody Mary bar with your meal. Enjoy!",

The table in front of us left and I was just seeing how long it took them to clean the table. They didn't clean it right away. They cleaned it when we were leaving about 40 mins later. sigh   Ordered the Cobb lobster salad $26.00   Seafood mac & Cheese $20.00 & salmon sandwich with bacon etc for $24.00  The salad was ok =T had much better before. Nothing special to it. Won't remember it. The seafood mac & cheese was decent and light tasting. The salmon sandwich was heavy & greasy. The bread was nice and toasted but it seems like they put better or oil on it cause my hands was soo greasy from picking it up. The sauce and mozzarella cheese made it very heavy for my breakfast.  Yes my breakfast is most people's lunch =P I wake up late.   The food was nothing great and nothing that I will be recalling to come back. the service was nice and super slow which I didn't like at all. Also how you going to ask someone how everything is when you just put my plate down. I didn't even try it. And also if I said it's not good your going to make me another one? that I need to wait another 15 mins for =T Sshsh",

Love the secluded Four Seasons location, right around the corner of Mandalay registration, take the marble steps down & you're transported to understated elegance.  Two choices for dining: inside or alfresco, looking out into the private pool area.  Good: *Iced tea w/iced tea cubes *Lobster Salad, no lettuce, but so many ingredients, delicious & fresh *Greens Salad, lovely light dressing & loved the mixed chartucerie *Beef tartare, w/whole grain mustard, balsamico & micro greens *Salmon w/lentils & a wine reduction, rustic, seared perfectly  Alright: *Amuse, prosciutto & melon shooter, an interesting take on the traditional appetizer, the melon was in liquid form, too sweet for my palate. *Halibut w/sundried tomatoes & olives, fish was nice, but bland, tomatoes and olives were not a nice marraige w/the halibut.  I thought it was funny that their take home utensils are SILVER plastic.  Solid food, but I wouldn't go out of my way to dine here, it's not an experience.",

I got the Grilled Portobello Parmesan, which if you get the portobello without the breading is egg-free, as I have an egg allergy. It's a decent grilled portobello mushroom and veggie patty, but nothing to write home about. I also couldn't resist getting a side of the truffle parmesan fries which normally come with the burger (and amounted to $8 worth of fries), and they were quite nice, if not particularly truffle-y; I really like truffle, so that was a little sad. My companions got a menagerie of items (there were 7 of us total), including the Chicken & Waffles, the Traditional Corned Beef & Pastrami Hash Skillet, the Chicken Angel Hair Pasta, and the Tuna Sampler. Everyone seemed pretty satisfied with their food, and the buffet looked pretty good, too (except that I probably could only have eaten like two things on it, so of course it made no sense for me to get that). One companion got a bloody mary as well and seemed pleased with that.  The service was lovely--our waiter was great looking things up for me and with making suggestions to group members who were on the fence about what to have. I don't think there's anything on the menu that would be vegan as is, but if you're vegan, I'm pretty sure your waiter here could work something out with the kitchen for you. It would be nice to see a vegetarian section (including a vegan sub-section and/or some markers for common allergens like dairy and nuts), but otherwise it was a lovely experience.  Overall, a tasty, if pricey meal, but if I were brunching in the area again, I'd certainly be willing to return :)",

Verandah's menu allows one to either order a particular item for brunch or one can do the all you can eat brunch buffet. Although a bit pricey (I think it is around $50 with a mimosa), you definately get what you pay for with the buffet.  I have been coming here for years and have always had great service, my water, coffee and juice always refilled and my check handed to me at an appropriate time. I highly recommend the guava juice if they have it that day.  Some highlights of the buffet include: 1) omelette station that doesn't consist of a family of 5 pushing you out of the way and a really depressed omelette chef who burns your omellete; 2) delicious pastries including mini chocolate croissants; 3) flavorful apple sausage; 4) cheeses and charcutterie items; 5) fresh fruit galore; 6) and FRESHLY MADE MINI DONUTS :)  I highly recommend this place for brunch if you want a peaceful, quality brunch in a restaurant setting, and to avoid the crazy crowds at some of the Strip's more popular buffets.",

As I mentioned in the hotel review, the smoothies/juices are to die for and they have a different flavor for the smoothie/juice of the day, daily. Their fruit was fresh and ripe and their scrambled eggs were cooked to perfection. I love their Bonne Mamman fruit preserves that they stock on all the tables, especially the raspberry. Yummy!   Coffee was awesome and if you're feeling daring their buffet is awesome and kind of a steal. I don't recall the exact amount per person but I think it was less than $40.    Lunch and dinner were fine here but honestly it was nothing especially wonderful. The tuna platter that they offer for lunch was tasty and I recall a wonderful wine selection.  I don't think this place can do any wrong. Staff is attentive and friendly as ever. Service is fairly quick, and if you eat outside (and you should) the view is fantastic.   Do it!",

Their iced tea is really good too by the way.  I've had their breakfast/brunch buffet and afternoon tea here. The buffet definitely is a better value compared to the tea service. Although, the buffet is small compared to all the buffets on the strip, the quality is better. Where else can you make/get fresh peanut butter? The buffet is $40 and afternoon tea is $35 per person.  Afternoon tea was good but I enjoyed tea at Mandarin Oriental and Bellagio (Petrossian Bar) more.  In case you are wondering like I was before I went... if you are staying at the Mandalay Bay or Delano, you can charge your expenses here to your room. And the answer is YES if you are wondering about comps too.",

That being said, I loved the Veranda brunch buffet. :)  I went with family not expecting much and was pleasantly surprised. There is a wide assortment of pastries at your disposal: danishes, coffee cakes, muffins, and all sorts of sweet treats. The fresh made donuts are top notch, and I definitely have to exercise restraint to avoid becoming Homer Simpson.  The breakfast items are great too. Scrambled eggs, breakfast potatoes, crispy hash browns, banana pancakes, and cinnamon French toast are all good. The meat selection and quality is excellent. Multiple types of sausages and bacon are great, and their bacon cheddar waffle with fried chicken is amazingly good.  I like to finish the meal with their bread pudding, which is delicious. Plus they have fresh juices that are really tasty. Today they had a watermelon lime juice that was perfect. Overall, this is the only brunch I have had in my life that I thoroughly enjoyed everything I tried.",

    "text": "Very good food and really nice atmosphere. We dropped in for a mid-week lunch and sat outside. Our waitress Kieu (\"Q\") was friendly and happy to give us some recommendations. The Veranda has a nice lunch menu with everything from pizza, pasta, entree salads and sandwiches. I started with a glass of wine which Kieu poured from the actual bottle which is a nice touch.   We ordered the gorgonzola fries to start. I chose the Charlie Palmer steak sandwich and my mom and other half both went with the Sin City burger. The Sin city is a wagyu burger with white cheddar, bacon, avocado and a side of truffle parmesan fries. The steak sandwich was a NY strip with arugula and steak fries.   The chips were house made and described as being served with a  gorgonzola \"fondue\". As delicious as the chips were there needed to be more cheese. After the first few chips the rest had no cheese on them.   The burgers and steak sandwich arrived a short time after.  My steak was cooked perfectly and the bread was super fresh. The steak fries were a little too thick and dry. I absolutely loved the smaller fries served with the burgers though. They were crispy and loaded with truffle and parmesan flavor. Next time I will ask for those instead of the steak fries.   Unfortunately the food runner mixed up the burgers and my mom and other half got each others (one medium, one rare). They figured it out after a few bites so we flagged down Kieu. She was very apologetic and asked if we wanted it remade, which my other half did. She told us the chef said it would be 15 minutes so he decided not to wait. The burger itself was large and they both said the flavor was delicious. We somehow had a little room for dessert so ordered a piece of chocolate cake to share.   As we were waiting, Tessa, The Veranda manager came by to apologize for the burger mix up. Tessa was a delight to speak to and obviously cares about her guests happiness. She was kind enough to comp us the cake which was a very nice gesture. Overall we had a wonderful lunch and plan on returning for their weekend brunch.",

    "text": "I took my mom here for their $100 (for two after taxes and tip) afternoon tea as an early Christmas present and she absolutely adored it! It was a lot of fun but it pained me to hand over my credit card. This isn't something I'd do often, but if you are into tea parties you should try it at least once.   The tea service setup is fun (but I was sad that the waiters were not wearing white gloves or anything; for that kind of per-person price they should've been playing it up like a scene out of \"Downton Abbey\") and semi-casual. There were lots of older socialite types as well as a few couples. You can opt to add a glass of champage or just go with the straight tea.   The tea menu is good, but I was sad that they were out of two of the teas (of course the one I wanted!) the day we were there. They should try harder to always have all the teas listed on hand; that really set a downer tone from the get-go.   We were presented with a tiered tower of treats: freshly baked scones on top, savory bites in the middle, then sweets on the bottom. The scones were INSANELY delicious. I wish we had a whole tower of just those. The clotted cream and preserves served alongside were some of the most delicious I've had anywhere, even in local tea houses in rural England.  The savory bites were good but not great. While they tasted freshly baked, some of the textures of the uniform pastry shells screamed \"premade.\" The sweets were the worst of the bunch; we took just one or two bites of most of those.   The staff said they do change up the goodies that are offered, so you may have different edibles than we had. The staff was prompt, courteous, and kept our teapots filled with hot water.  One suggestion I'd have for the tea service: it would be nice if the restaurant tried to make it feel more special and/or romantic. Maybe have some live music or play classical music or curtain off a special area of the restaurant. A lot of ambiance was lost with the television over the bar blaring an NBA basketball game.   The tea service requires a 24 hour's notice reservation, so make sure you call ahead or stop by to avoid disappointment.",

    "text": "I visited Verandah on Saturday, Feb. 8th and was very disappointed. My sister made reservations for 12:30 brunch and we showed up a half hour early and they were able to accommodate us (there were very few people there). The valet parking is free which was nice. We decided to sit outside since the weather was nice. We walked through the dining room and saw all the delicious food available through the buffet. We got seated in a remote corner outside.   When we sat down, we learned that the buffet was $40 (and even more if we wanted mimosas with it). For BRUNCH. I mean, yes it's Vegas, everything is overpriced and that's a common price. But this place is not in a highly trafficked area and is further south on the Strip, so I can't imagine why they think they should be charging that amount. We went out of our way to drive there when we could've easily found a better meal for the same price in or near our hotel (Cosmopolitan).  We decided to forgo the buffet and order lunch. We first ordered mimosas ($14 each! They certainly were not that good). A guy (not our waiter) came around offering coffee which, at any other restaurant, is complimentary, especially when we hadn't requested it and the cups they used were tiny espresso cups. When we got the bill, we saw they charged us $6 EACH - for coffee none of us even drank and was cold. $18 for nothing. So absurd.   My sister ordered sushi and was very happy with it. I believe it was tuna. My friend ordered a salmon sandwich that she also enjoyed, and that came with sweet potato fries. My meal, however, was severely lacking. I ordered the chicken pesto sandwich. The pesto aioli was too goopy and thick and not tasty at all (and I consider myself a pesto connoisseur). It came with tomato jam, which I had never tried before, and found it was too sweet (I would have preferred regular tomato or even sun dried tomatoes). I substituted mozzarella instead of the provolone which made it better. But overall the sandwich was just \"ok\" and I found myself scraping a lot of the toppings off and just eating the chicken. My sweet potato fries were BURNED. The waitress came over right as I said to my friends \"these are burned\" and pushed them aside and she didn't say a word, didn't offer to bring more... nothing.   The bill came - $125 for this mediocre lunch (before tip), including the overpriced coffees that we never ordered.  Considering how much they charge and the quality of the food, I would suggest finding another place for brunch (I can't speak for the buffet or breakfast). But if I'm going to be nickel and dimed, I at least want a good meal and decent drinks. I would not recommend Verandah.",

LET ME SAY !! the BRUNCH here is FABULOUS.  Here's why : they have a donut making station. Where they make little round donuts - with a hole, but any way you want. FRESH FRESH FRESH and mini, so you can pretend you aren't getting THAT FAT.  They had these guava pancakes that had a slightly pink tinge, and sound crazy but were very moist and almost creamy. The usual suspects are present - corned beef hash, eggs benedict, french toast, eggs, potatoes, 2 kinds of bacon etc... Some other not so typical stuff also, little personal tins of egg white frittata with veggies, veggie quiche mini's. Lots of nice pastries and bagels, cold cereal, fruit etc...  I think the price was about $40. AYCE. No alcohol included.   The atmosphere is nice. You can sit indoor or outdoor by the pool. This restaurant is inside the Four Seasons. Service is always good. Good OJ, the kind that tastes like a real orange. YUM.",

    "text": "As far as the old system of dining goes, Verandah would probably be considered a \"5-star\" restaurant. Fancy setting, high prices, impeccable service, etc. However in the new food era, it's not just all about being hoity-toity. To get high stars in my book you need to have good food, and provide some form of value proposition. Based on my breakfast at verandah, I'd have to say that A-OK is proper.   From entry to exit here, the service is beyond impeccable. They ask your name at the desk and you're subsequently greeted by name by every server that approaches you. Coffee is kept full, and it's white-glove the whole way. The setting is very pleasant - outdoors next to the Mandalay pool system - very elegant.   The food itself, however, leaves a bit to be desired. It's okay, but for the price it could be a lot better. I sampled a plate of huevos rancheros that cost about as much as a dinner entree would cost at a decent restaurant. $5 for drip coffee is beyond the pale. Overall it was up in the mid-$20's for a simple entree+coffee breakfast.   I guess I'm not someone who is willing to pay all that extra for exclusivity. Coming from Portland I want the food to be exemplary at that price - especially for breakfast, which is notoriously easy to prepare.   If you want a four-seasons experience, this is your place. If your main goal is good food, you may be able to do better.",

They have a fabulous looking all-you-can-eat brunch on the weekends (was tempted just to try the doughnuts), but we opted for farm to fork menu items instead.  The eggs benedict is perfectly prepared, served over tender polenta cakes along with snapping asparagus spears.  The wife went with the corned beef and pastrami hash that had the best crispy potatoes available on any breakfast menu.  The son got mini belgian waffles that he smothered in cinnamon butter and syrup.  The service was perfect and the atmosphere is far more relaxing than fighting the lines at the casino buffets.",

Fair enough.  I especially like having lunch here. I try to get in one lunch per visit, just for this reason alone: ice tea ice cubes. Yes, just like Bonjour Cafe does with their ice coffee w/coffee ice cubes (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/bonjour-french-pastry-gardena\">yelp.com/biz/bonjour-fre...</a>), this Four Seasons doesn't dilute their ice tea with regular ol' water ice cubes. Bah. That's for amateurs. Here, they bring you a glass filled with ice tea cubes and then pour in the hot ice tea, so you get full concentration and no dilution of a caffeine buzz.  Their soups, salads and sandwiches are always nice. And if it's a nice day out, you can eat al fresco.   Apparently, them changing out by white napkin for a black one because I was wearing black slacks was a big deal, because DK asked what the heck they were doing. I thought it was pretty common, but I guess not. Or maybe I've just been frequenting restaurants where they care about you not walking out looking like a doofus with white lint all over your white pants.  This is the only Four Seasons I know of that has the ice tea cubes. So don't blame me if you go to another Four Seasons asking for this and they look at you all crazy-like.",

    "text": "This is a review specifically on the Afternoon Tea that the Four Seasons Verandah offers.  I attended this place with my mother to celebrate her visit to Vegas and I decided to take her to afternoon tea here.    Afternoon Tea here is offered from 3-4pm from Mon/Fri. Holy cow.  After that experience at Bellagio, this was just -wonderful.-  The view out into the gardens was beautiful.  Their current theme of decor was Lilies and they were everywhere, designed into beautiful arcs that hung gracefully in a festoon that was minimalist and graceful.  We had a single table by the window and it was just a must.  It was summer and everywhere we gazed out our glass windows was lush green, green, green.  It was so tranquil and a firm glass of serenity that you rarely can find in Vegas which, to a certain extent, I will be more than happy to pay a ton of money for.    Of course, being that was at one of the top-shelf properties here in Vegas, I knew going in that it was going to be not cheap.  But it wasn't outrageous and I didn't feel uncomfortable with the price.  The service was top-notch, the quality of the blend of tea, the scones and food was excellent, and I was very satisfied with the entire experience.    When someone asks me where the best Afternoon Tea in Vegas is, I respond with this establishment, if that says anything.  ***On my List of Afternoon Teas in Vegas, this is currently rated as #1.  Please check out my list of Tea Houses, both local and national to compare.**",

It was my first time having afternoon tea service so I didn't have anything to compare it to but can say that I liked it.  First of all, it was so cute and girly as there were several parties of mothers and their young daughters that afternoon.  What a fun idea for an outing!  As for the tea and food, overall it was all very good.  I asked the waiter if he could suggest something fruity for me and really liked what he picked out.  (I'm pretty sure it was the Mountain Berry Tisane.)  The sandwiches and scones/spread tasted great!  Must admit I wasn't too crazy over their dessert, though.  Some of it was actually dry.  The next day we came back for breakfast and ate out by the pool.  It was a hot day but clouds and misters helped keep us cool.  The atmosphere was amazing!  Totally recommend eating out there.  The food was average.  Not the best breakfast food I've had but not the worst either.  (Surprising but restaurants can actually do bad breakfast food!)  It was also pretty expensive, maybe $30 for my order.  But then again it's the Four Seasons and you're paying for atmosphere as well.  I got The American - eggs, hash brown, choice of meat, bread, and juice.  I forgot what juice I had but whatever it was it was so delish and refreshing!    I really enjoyed both of my visits so four stars for Verandah!",

The male hostess was acting way too important on the phone to acknowledge us. After a 5 minute wait we were sat.   We both did the buffet. The scrambled eggs were ice cold, the cold cuts tasted like they had been out days, and in general nothing was spectacular.   I've eaten here before and it was excellent. So I was very surprised that the food quality was not up to par this time.   While fixing myself a bagel, a staff member was wiping down the sneeze sheild in front of me. Don't get me wrong I'm totally for cleanliness, but I was losing my appetite watching her do it right in front of my plate.   The service was also slow which always surprises me at restaurants with buffets because their job is so easy.   I love the four seasons but I don't plan on eating here again.",

I've been on a donut kick lately and I'm usually not a fan. When we sat, our server went over the menu and told us we had the option of buffet or a la carte. I couldn't decide at first, there was a lemon ricotta pancake that had caught my eye on the a la carte menu, but the donut station sealed the deal for me.  I was impressed with the different buffet station, lots of different parfaits and yogurts, an omelet station, and they had all small plates so you could sample a little bit of everything. They also had a pastry station with a spot to make your own homemade peanut butter.   Everything we had was really good. I would bump this up to 5 stars if they offered a bottomless mimosa on the menu. They had a bloody mary bar, but not all of are fans.   This brunch buffet was way better than the Country Club at the Wynn, almost half the price. I totally recommend.",

Which we were promptly. After being seated it took us between 5-7 minutes to be greeted by someone. In that timeframe I did notice multiple servers look in our direction but not come to acknowledge us.  When we were greeted it seemed our server was not enthused to have new guests dining. We ordered drinks and food all at once since we had been unwillingly given the time to do so. Waters took awhile, speaking of, the bus person was the kindest interaction we had. I believe his name was Jose, very polite and genuine. The coke and raspberry tea we had ordered took some time , but were kept filled  after they arrived on a positive note. Bread service arrived about 2 minutes before our entrees made there way. Disappointing because it wasn't anything special. Just a stale white loaf with a hard side of plain butter. My tomato soup was quite good. The rest of the entrees were subpar. I have a hard time believing real Wagyu beef is used for the burger, and the bun was nothing special. Caesar Salad dressing was nice , however the chicken added was bland and seemed not freshly prepared.  I understand restaurants on the strip have unionized food servers. But sometimes maybe they get to comfortable and forget how to provide a positive experience.",

From valet to the front door every staff member makes you feel so important and appreciated which make you love where you're at. The Veranda is tucked in the back corner next to Charlie Palmers stake house with a newly renovated out door patio. The patio offers a great view of the pool and beautiful comfortable furniture to either lounge or enjoy your brunch on out doors. We chose to dine indoors because of our new born.   Inside, the classic decor give off a very comfy vibe and dinning room was nicely lit. We did the Sunday brunch which is $39.99 per person which includes drinks and the bottomless Bloody Mary is an extra $20.00 I think. As you walk in they have an awesome omelette bar and a mini donut station. The food were delicious and very nicely set you.   They had more then enough variety of yummy food to choose from. After everything they even brought out a plate of sea salt chocolate truffle that said Happy Birthday and it was so good and nice of them.   A great brunch spot for locals and you feel like a king for a great price! I will defiantly be back!",

The highlight of the buffet was the donut bar - all donuts are made in front of you and you can customize them based on what kind of toppings you'd like. They also had a lot of holiday specialties at the buffet. As far as the a la carte menu I loved the avocado toast with poached eggs.",

The shortrib was requested with a soft polenta substitute for the regular mashed potatoes, and this combo would be hard to beat, very tender large boneless shortrib slow braised with lots of flavor throughout and a nice crisp outer layer, sitting on a bed of perfect polenta with a few root veggie cubes. The lobster tail tagliatelle was  very good with a fresh grilled tail that was tender, but a touch salty. Service from Jose and Harjut was excellent.",

We sat inside, but from the looks of it, sitting outside would still be a nice environment for a meeting. All around, it's a nice spot to enjoy good food, good service and hopefully nice weather.  The service was excellent and the wait staff was very aware of our needs - we were spoiled! The soup of the day was mushroom when we went and it was excellent - everyone at our table had a cup. Portions for the lunch menu were manageable, too, not overwhelming.   Located in the Four Seasons at the south end of The Strip, Veranda's staff meets the standards that I would expect at a location like this. They went above and beyond and that was just for lunch. I would love to enjoy an evening meal here.",

    "text": "There aren't a lot of dining options at Four Season LV but at least what they do have tastes good! We tried out Veranda for both the breakfast buffet and the regular dinner and we were pretty happy both times.   Dinner: The service was top notch and in particular, our server (I forgot his name but he was a blondish man in maybe his 40s) couldn't be nicer and more accommodating. The portions were larger than I expected. We split a Caesar salad and it was a generous portion. My husband had the shrimp pasta and he said it was one of the best pasta dishes he's ever had (and he's a pasta fanatic). I had the braised short ribs and every bite was super tender and melted in my mouth. We also tried the dessert that included four ice cream bars (made in house - caramel ice cream coated with chocolate and nuts) and they were delicious and just perfect for sharing. My toddler's pasta with red sauce was a very generous portion and he enjoyed his scoop of gelato as well. The setting is \"fancy\" but they were great with our toddler and had a coloring book with crayons available.   Breakfast: You can either order off the menu or do the buffet and we opted to do the buffet, which is priced about the same as other more high-end resort buffets. What I liked about this is that the food was pre-portioned into single servings so things like bread pudding didn't look all gross after a few people have dug into it. The options include: corned beef hash (with shoestring potatoes), peach pancakes, egg florentine, hash browns (actually, this was a bit salty), bread pudding, scones, house smoked salmon, bacon, sausages, lots of pastries, some kind of quinoa chia pudding, oatmeal, yogurt and granola parfait, omelet station, melon slices, mixed berries, and even more things that I can't remember. There was also a kids station (kids height) with breakfast sandwiches, fruit kabobs, vegetable sticks (with dip), and jam sandwiches.   The coconut mango Greek yogurt flan was AMAZING. (I need the recipe!) I don't like yogurt but this was not tart or yogurt-y. The mini donuts, which is what everyone talks about, are delicious and made fresh. I recommend the cinnamon sugar one which tastes like a churro.",

Children get a coloring book, souvenir cup, and they even play cartoons if you need that to keep children still.   The brunch is $39 and for a Four Seasons restaurant, its a very reasonable. Children are $16. Most items come in individual serving dishes and the highlight is a donut maker that will customize to your taste.   Highlights of items include rustic cut corned beef hash skillet, red quinoa cereal, chicken apple sausage, applewood smoked bacon, chilaquiles, florentine eggs benedict hollandaise, mascarpone cheese blintz roasted apple glaze and ricotta pancakes. You can also choose an unlimited bloody mary bar.   Unlike many Vegas strip buffet, they do take reservations, so use Open Table to make guarantee seating, because it gets busy here.",

    "text": "There are honestly a limitless number of breakfast/brunch restaurants to explore in Vegas and it can be difficult choosing between them. There are some that I say are undeniably above the rest and while Veranda may not be one of those select few, it is still incredibly good.  The setting is great and I don't know if there's a better outdoor seating environment on the strip than overlooking the pool at the Four Seasons. It is a casual restaurant experience which is great for when you roll out of your bed but it also feels like a country club. The prices also reflect that feeling. It is not exuberantly expensive by any means...it is also not IHOP.  -Smores French Toast. Obviously delicious and something that could kill you upon first consumption. Probably worth it though.  -Breakfast Panini. Super good. Won't destroy your stomach but still has a lot of flavor and tastes healthy which is a plus even if it is most likely a lie. Burrata tomatoe spinach pesto eggs etc. It all works.  The fruit plates and the pastries are also nice and fresh. It's hard to describe the intricacies of a medium to high priced breakfast cafe but you should reasonably know what to expect. I am the kind of person that has never been blown away by breakfast food no matter where it is, except Border Grill but more on that later. For a relaxing breakfast at a cafe it's hard to get better than this.",

The place is so lovely, quiet and relaxing it's almost like not being in Vegas at all (which sometimes is a good thing.)  We opted to have champagne with our tea (why stop drinking now?) and chose the Organic Assam tea which was amazing! Also amazing are the scones, with and without currants. Super light and delicious. The sandwiches (there are four) are all good, but only the smoked turkey stood out to me. We were sadly underwhelmed by the desserts. I think the mango tart was the best of the bunch.  Service is fabulous - unobtrusive while still being attentive.",

I've been to London & love their Afternoon Tea, and wanted to do something similar with my friends. From the reviews, I thought Verandah would be a perfect fit. We arrived early & were told we had to wait until 3pm. Waiting 15 mins was fine. We were taken to our table shortly after 3pm, and served water. Then we waited. And waited. And waited. It was 20 mins before anyone took our tea order.  Now...the place was NOT busy. Our table of four was the biggest table they had in the room we were in, and the front room had maybe three tables. What really bothered us was the table of two that came in several minutes after us for their tea, that was served before us. Um...not cool. My friend's water glass was empty several minutes & several waiters rushed past us so fast we couldn't flag them down to ask for more. I contemplated getting up to serve her water myself, but finally a slower moving waitress walked past & I was able to ask for water.  I realize the experience is supposed to be a relaxing one, but when you can't keep water glasses full & you're serving tea and food to people who arrive later than your other customers, that's just not the service I would expect from the Four Seasons.   The food was pretty good, though. Which is a pity because we won't be going back.",

As someone said -- \"This is simply the best outdoor place to eat in Vegas....the decor is relaxing, fresh, pool side, green, so soothing!!\"  Indeed. So relaxing, fresh, clean, quiet --- a stark contrast to the rest of Vegas.  The coffee was perfect and I am a picky coffee person. Service was good and not in your face at all. But the best part was the main.  Huevos rancheros. A relatively straightforward dish. Made differently at a lot of places. But this sets the standard. The plate came out piping hot, the flavors mixed together so well, and the presentation was superb.  Let me put it this way --- I eat out a LOT and am blessed to try some amazing places. I rarely have something I remember vividly later. The duck at the Modern in NYC, the cashew chicken at Ryutenmon Tokyo, the sushi at Kaygetsu here in in Menlo Park --- and now the huevos rancheros at Verandah Vegas. Well done guys, thank you for a great meal.",

I guess that is to be expected since it is the Four Seasons Hotel.  One of the reasons I like Verandah is because they are on <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FOpenTable.com&s=c91bdbc3a0ec574526e58696cba3aeccf3c9f0bf51b27a302b229c80b40f42ac\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">OpenTable.com</a>. That usually makes it very easy to have a space reserved between classes at the conference. Sometimes lunch time during a conference with 20,000 people can be a challenge. Open Table reservations make that challenge easy to overcome.  But tonight the hostess did not credit my Open Table reservation. Instead she canceled it. I tried to explain to her that I did not cancel my reservation we just came an hour early since one member of our party had to get to the airport. It became difficult for something that should have been so easy.   While the food was good, and the service was good, the experience was a little frustrating. However, I will give them a chance to make it better next time.",

The scones are small, silver dollar sized and so flaky and you can ask for more.  The wait staff's attention to detail is very good, I wore black slacks, they gave me a black linen napkin instead of the usual white, so there wouldn't be lint on my pants.  \r 4 different  tea sandwiches and 4 different desserts on a tiered \r serving dish.  Each person gets their own choice of tea.  Around $30. \r Beautiful atmosphere in the Verandah, both dining inside and out, next to the pool.

The Lunch is very tasty and a nice change from most Vegas lunches.  At dinner, however, the kitchen deludes itself into believing that it is a top rate dining establishment.    If this place would realize that it is what it is, I am sure it could be a great all around cafe.  One thing that the Strip is definitely missing.",

Open M-F from 3PM to 4PM  $35 High Tea $50 Champagne Tea  Pinky finger must always be up   My bestie and I had so much fun! (We mostly entertained ourselves.)  The scones were traditional English style scones that were flaky and buttery. There was Devonshire Cream, Raspberry Jelly, and Lemon Curd to top it off. The finger sandwiches, sesame and beet cones were savory. The bite-sized desserts were very good. This season, they had an Oreo Candy Cane Cheesecake. The menu also had remnants of fall with pumpkin and maple. As much as I do appreciate seasonal menus, I was over the fall pumpkin spice and the Christmasy candy cane flavors.   The menu changes with the season. We will try again in the spring/summer.   The tea I had was the Organic Assam, delicious with a bit of sugar and milk.   I've had High Tea in Toronto and my friend in Cape Town and abroad. We are going to try the ones at MO and Wynn as well. So far High Tea at Veranda was good, but ranked low on our personal lists.",

We really appreciated being greeted so warmly by the hostesses upon entering and Mr. Todorovic ( the general manager) was kind enough to give us a personal greeting this morning.

Both plain and currant scones with strawberry preserves, clotted cream and lemon curd. Nice assortment of finger sandwiches, and four different bite sized desserts (as if scones with clotted cream aren't enough).  Weren't able to finish everything, so they boxed up what we had left and also included clotted cream  lemon curd to go (along with a few extra scones). Typical top notch service you would expect from a Four Seasons.  If you are celebrating anything in particular (eg. Anniversary, birthday), make sure to let them know and they bring out a plate celebrating your special event along with some truffles. And if you have a non tea drinker at the table, the bottomless hot chocolate with fresh whipped cream is delicious.  Only complaint is that they ended up seating a party in the tea area which was just ordering from the bar menu and they were a bit boisterous. Would suggest that they seat then in the non tea areas during tea service.",

I've been to about 5 buffets on the strip, and this is by far my favorite one. The selection might not be as vast as others, but it's just done so much better in terms of food quality. Everything is just fresher.   Items include: - Fresh baby donut station (my mom says they're good only when hot) - Omelet station - Plenty of sweet, fresh fruit like segmented grapefruit, orange, sweet berries, and sliced melon - Egg frittata, small quiche Lorraine - Unlimited thick cut bacon, two types - Really good chicken and waffles - Breakfast pizza - Big bakery item selection (this actually didn't look particularly appealing to me)  They do charge for parking. Since my brother is M Life Gold, we parked at Mandalay and took the connecting hallway over to Four Seasons.   Tips:  - For when the weather is nice, make a reservation to sit outside on the shaded patio.  - If you get full fast, share a couple of items with your table so that you can split bites and still try everything. This worked out great for our family of 3, and we just went back for more of what we really liked!",

    "text": "Overall: DO NOT go on a holiday, good food with a few exceptions, no alcoholic drinks included.   Price is $39 for brunch on a regular day and $80 on a holiday.   We had some difficulties with this restaurant which I'll get to later, but first I'll talk about the food. We made reservations for Sunday brunch, and it happened to be Father's day, so we are unsure if it was a different menu or not but the menu seemed comparable to what was online. There were several stations: one more focused on breakfast with egg dishes, bacon, yogurt parfaits, etc., and these were all very good. The candied bacon was excellent in particular. There is also a small kids table. Next, there was a sushi/fish station. We enjoyed the tuna and salmon glasses but the sushi was not fresh, and I had one bite before giving up on that. There is a cheese and charcuterie selection as well, with mostly blue cheeses which were not my favorite but they seemed to be good cheeses overall. We loved the dessert station with dessert non-alcoholic martinis, cakes, cupcakes, and freshly make mini-donuts (skip the ones with the frosting, it's too sweet). There was an avocado bar oddly placed outside the restaurant; some people were even eating it while waiting in line. It seemed like anyone walking by could get some. The avocado bar was nice though; we tried the crab avocado toast. By the pool was a barbeque area with an Asian station with lovely duck buns, a taco station which also was good, and a meat section. The meat section had a large beef rotisserie which was dry and chewy and seemed like the meat had been there for a while untouched. I would skip out on this meat as well. They also have several fresh juices they bring to the table.   So overall, we did enjoy the food. When we thought we were paying the $39 for the buffet, we enjoyed the food and overall experience even though some food was a little less fresh than desired.   Next, we get to my issue with the place. When I made a reservation, I received an email confirmation saying we were confirmed for my specific date (which happened to be father's day) for the price of $39 per person. I was traveling with my boyfriend and mom and it never really occurred to us that it was Father's Day or that anything would be different since the email confirmation stated the price was $39. When we got the check, it says $80 a person - over DOUBLE what we were told! We asked the waitress and she said the price was correct, so we followed up with the manager the next day who was rude and demeaning. There is no excuse for the overcharge since I have an email confirmation saying the price was less than half of that which was listed. We are in the process of getting refunded for the overcharge, but even if we knew it was $80, I would not say the service and food are worth that. My suggestion is do not go to the Veranda on a holiday. The food is no better than on a regular day, and I don't see how this could justify for over double the price. They didn't even offer drinks. The Sterling Brunch at another Vegas hotel is $90, and they provide unlimited caviar and champagne! This brunch is just not worth $80 for the price.",

The wait staff were very friendly and even gave us their extra desserts.  I would definitely support them.  Tip:  I would recommend the chef to keep all the font colors the same as their use of the reddish pink font on the menu may be consTrued as requiring an extra payment.",

However, the service was not the quality I would expect & the TRADITIONAL CARBONARA was horrible. First, the server was condescending. When I asked about how the courses should/could work (antipasti, primi, secondi, etc.), she didn't answer my question, but managed to tell us twice the portions weren't Cheesecake Factory size, but a good size. Just because I'm a little overweight & not sure how the courses at the Veranda work, doesn't mean I know what the portions are like at Cheesecake Factory, which I don't, or that I'm worried that I won't have enough to stuff my face! The server was also inattentive, disappointing since we were there for an early dinner and it wasn't busy!  (Only 3 other tables in the place). We picked this restaurant because I was craving Carbonara...I still am. The portion was plenty, too bad it was not tasty. It was a nest of noodles with the lightly cooked egg in the middle, two thumbs up for presentation. But the noodles were not quite al dente & super dry. So it was difficult to stir the egg around, all in all, it mostly tasted like undercooked noodles. To leave on a positive note, the bread, olive oil & balsamic were delish!",

The scones had nice flavor but the bake was bad. They were very under cooked. The sandwiches were not great. The one with goat cheese was particularly unpleasant. That was my husband's least favorite thing we ate. The goat cheese was so strong of goat. The best sandwich was the chicken salad but it was only average.  The dessert tray was very pretty but they weren't worth the calories. The Yule log was probably the best. Very chocolate but it had nice flavor and texture. The fruit cake and egg nog creme brulee were very boozy. I'm not a drinker so that doesn't appeal to my palate but I think that might have just been preference. The fruit cake was a bit stodgy though. The worst thing on the plate for me was the chestnut tart. It just tasted like sugar flavor chalk. It was probably the worst dessert I've had at a higher end restaurant.",

While it's not going to be hundreds of food choices like at the bigger hotel buffets, the ambiance and lack of crowds more than makes up for it.  It's nice to not have to wait in a long line (i.e. Bellagio buffet), and fights with hoards of people.  Relaxing and nice environment to enjoy brunch!",

    "text": "Maybe it was the company.  Maybe it was the food.  I'll say it was a combination for a lovely Sunday brunch at Veranda!  Located in the Four Seasons, you can use valet complimentary when dining at one of their restaurants.  Veranda sits notably at the end of the hall.  We had to wait only about 5 minutes to be seated even with reservations.  That's ok. Once inside it was all good.  I love that since the reservation was under my name that she would use it frequently when checking on the table.  Service was very attentive throughout our meal.    Their Sunday Brunch Buffet offers many options without feeling overloaded.  Of course you have an omelet station as well as fresh baked mini donuts.  Benedict, waffles, blintz' and breakfast meats are just to name a few of their offerings.  There is a designated table with breads and pastries that all looked delightful!  The food seemed to be fresh and not heat lamp baked.  It may have been because we went during a busy time so items weren't sitting very long.    I realize that you pay a little more but every once in a while won't hurt.",

While the apps were good (beet salad and ahi tuna) the mushroom soup was not very good and we ended up just returning it, uneaten. They still charged us for that, by the way. Two of our four pastas came out lukewarm--not what you expect for a $30 pasta.  They were very willing to redo them, but they all came out under seasoned and very unimpressive.  The vegetarian lasagna tasted like a came from a frozen meal.  It had obviously been sitting because the cheese on top was dried out.  The center was warm, but the outside was lukewarm.  Overall, not impressed by the kitchen execution here, even though the servers did try to make up for it.",

I feel like a little kid getting all excited and am disappointed every time I dine at a FS restaurant. I decided never come back to Veranda, but why?  1) The service was not on par with that of other FS restaurants - While the food at Allium and Blue Bar are mediocre, the waiters are friendly and helpful. On the other hand, the waiter at Veranda confused the orders of my friend and mine. She also forgot our requests for water.  2) The food was mediocre - Although I appreciated the parfait being less sweet, I was not happy that the ratio of the non-fat Greek yogurt and the granola was one to four. I ended up eating dry nuts most of the time. The orange juice that both of us had was not fresh and was slightly bitter. The juice was definitely two levels below that in MOzen at Mandarin Oriental.   Although I enjoyed the view of the pool and the palm trees, I was disappointed by the overpriced mediocre food of Verandah. I would rather pay slightly more for the food and drinks at MOzen.",

Server was not attentive, $14 Mimosas served in a tiny skinny champagne flute, the orange juice was not even fresh, it was from a bottle but they will lie to you because I asked if it was fresh and I was told that yes it was, then I asked if it was freshly squeezed on the premises and was told that actually not they get it bottled - why the bs?! If OJ is bottled it's pasteurized NOT FRESH, and I could definitely taste that it wasn't fresh. The Frittata ($18) was a very small serving and completely flavorless, even the accompanying veggies were bland. We ended up paying $140 for a simple breakfast for 2. We expected the high prices since it's the Four Seasons, however it was a total let down, we didn't expect the Mimosas to be $14 - what a joke.",

I guess my palate isnt trained yet but I didn't  like the polenta eggs Benedict.  4 stars is for the service and the ambience. Loved sitting outside on a nice morning. The staff did bring us a plate with chocolates on it with \"happy anniversary\" written on the plate so we definitely appreciated that.

Its a real getaway from the casino crowd.  It feels like you are not in Vegas, which is kinda nice being able to enjoy your dinner.  The brunch was a bit disappointing in terms of the Vegas offering, but the qualities are much better. I loved the make your own peanut butter machine, so fun!  freshly made doughnuts are good too.  The dinner, however, it was a real deal.  I loved the regional Italian dinner prix-fixe Menu.  from appetizers, main courses to dessert, are all wonderfully prepared and reasonably priced (Vegas pricing).  I loved the way he cooked the fish, one of the best fish dishes I had in Vegas.  Definitely worth a visit if you are in Vegas and don't want to have an overpriced dinner.",

The watermelon and tomatoes were bright red and they were delicious. Next we had the Grilled Salmon on top of the Field Greens Salad. Both dressing's were spectacular and it was a perfect late lunch to hold us over for dinner.   I was here about 6 months ago and the service was terrible and the food was mediocre.

Sadly, our attempt for a fine dining evening experience at the Veranda was far less than satisfactory. They have redecorated the restaurant in what might be described as Contemporary Pacific Rim for Italian fare. Ambiance aside, it was the dinners that fell hopelessly into the category of grossly over priced for very unimpressive cuisine. One member of our party had to send his inedible pasta dish back, not once, but twice. The fact that his dinner was later comped did not alter the on going dining disruption for our entire party. Other guests found their dinners ranged from grossly lacking to ordinary. A Filet steak that was ordered Medium was served Rare. A side order of spinach was 1/2 cup of tasteless lukewarm greens. The Cotton Candy creation that was to be shared was laughable and correctly described by another reviewer.",

The BF got eggs, bacon and toast. The typical and he said it was tasty. I got the Quatro, a small Gluten free waffle, scrambled egg whites with asparagus and pesto, grapefruit segments in agave syrup and a carrot juice shooter. The waffle was surprisingly good and who'd know that it was gluten free...no one! The egg whites were light and fluffy and very flavorful with the pesto. The carrot juice was very refreshing.   Our server was great, my coffee was always full and it seemed when I went to pour my coffee he was right there behind me to stop me and did it for me.  I look forward to my next visit for brunch and am hoping that all the awesome little stations we saw are the norm, I know some are but I have a feeling there may have been some additional ones for the occasion. I shall find out soon enough!",

The GF waffles are amazing, and although they use the same GF bread I do at home... it just seemed better.  Fruit was fresh, and juicy.  Chicken Apple sausage was not under/over done, and the mango/guava juice was sweet and not too thin.  Our men had the brunch buffet, and everything looked great from there as well.  On the room service/poolside menu  food:  All was fabulous!

We had the Seafood Macaroni and Cheese with Truffle, the V Burger and for starters the Seafood Frito Misto. All was very good. The next day we decided to go to the Saturday Breakfast Buffet and it was a terrible mistake. We arrived shortly after the opening and were greeted fine and seated outside as requested. After we were provided our beverages we proceeded to the buffet however there was only half of the food ready. The silver chafing dishes were empty. We then took what was available however once we got back to the table we found the food was barely warm. We ate a bit of it and then went back to the buffet and found there was more food. We loaded our plates and once again the food was barely warm.  There were no waitress around and then the man in the suit came and asked if everything was ok? We told him the food was cold and he replied that he would go find out why. He came back shortly after and proceeded to explain that the hot pans were not ready which is why the food was not warm, duh! He walked away.After that a waitress came and asked the same question and we told her the same and she said oh, that's too bad.",

    "text": "I just returned from one of the most overpriced lunches ever.  it was at the verandah at the four seasons hotel, which is also located in the mandalay bay resort.  the hotel has a private entrance away from the main entrance of the mandalay.  It does continue on with that slightly tropical, slightly Asia and beautiful resort dcor from the mandalay. theme.  there was indoor and outdoor seating available overlooking the pool.  the tables and chairs were of rattan amidst the wood tones around the restaurant.   We started with tuna sampler of tuna tartare (ahi poke), blackened sashimi (seared tuna) and spicy tuna maki roll (spicy tuna roll)...good but unimpressive.  We also had the tasty and crispy crab cakes on a jicama-green papaya-mango slaw (this is a definite recommendation...i just love that slaw).   my friend had the original san francisco crab louis, which was loaded with hella lumps of crab meat.  i had the nioise Salad with grilled hawaiian rare tuna (these were meaty bastards that resembled slightly rare steak with a shiny sheen under different lights), haricot vert, roasted potatoes, cherry tomatoes, capers, and big chunks of red and green olives sprayed with vinager.   We also ordered garlic and parmesan fries, sweet potato fries, which both needed a better dip than ketchup.  (note the sweet potato fry comment on my pop's review...totally better over at pop's.)  my friend could not stop raving about the macaroni and cheese (sounds like somebody else out there...Ed M.)  and wholly crap!!!  it was damn good, in fact i took some back to the office and eating it right now.  this cheese is just extremely creamy, but what I love about it is the garlic toast sprinkles all over the top.  when you mix it all up, every bite you'll taste the creamy buttery cheese, the  softness of the macaroni, crunchy little bits scattered throughout.  we did finish it off with the mini eskimos, roasted nuts and dark chocolate covered vanilla ice cream bars on a stick.  i had to have two!!! if i could i would like to give this place 3 and a half stars.  i mean the mini eskimos and crab cakes were good.  i ordered the nicoise salad  because it looked and tasted good, plus i didn't see anything appetizing in the entree section.  it is a good thing b/c i probably wouldnt have had the chance to try the mac and cheese and fries.  both items were side dishes, and they were happy to whip us up an order.  i would like to return here for afternoon tea and then add some more insight to this place...till then...",

In addition to incredible food and beautiful ambiance (peaceful in crazy Vegas) we had the most personable experience I've ever had. Our servers name was Kevin. We had great appetizers and then our entrees came out. My friend ordered the filet steak and it came out a little too well done- although the flavor was delicious. We told them and they cleared it immediately. While they were redoing the dish -the server, manager, and head chef! came out to apologize and sent out two amazing courses in the mean time! (So over and beyond) -gourmet courses that were delectable- in addition to apology on apology (all over a steak taking an extra 10 minutes which was no big deal to begin with). Dinner was cleared and they continued to send out limoncello after dinner cocktails. We had dessert and too top it all off Kevin sent out a plate with a personalized message written in chocolate! Needless to say -excellent excellent service. Delicious food. Cheers to Kevin and to Verandah for a wonderful and memorable evening.",

I was lucky enough to be invited to dinner by a friend of mine, whose parents were in town and were staying at the Four Seasons.  I loved the ambiance the wait staff was professional, courteous, and attentive and provided the level of service you would expect from a luxury hotel restaurant. I think what's unique about this restaurant is that you can have any dish in an appetizer size or an entree size, and the dish is priced accordingly. I had the clam linguini, appetizer size and it was delicous the white wine sauce was superb along with the pasta, freshly chopped tomatoes, and clams.  Verandah also serves excellent bread while you wait for your meal. If you have an expense account, I highly recommend this restaurant.",

In our trek from The Encore to the restaurant Verandah for the Travelzoo promotional 5-course dinner for two, we casually walked through several hotels, taking in the sites.  We noticed many crowded, loud, bustling restaurants, booming with music or the loud echos of chatter and dishes clanking and bouncing from the casino ceiling and walls.  And suddenly, we were here at Verandah, led out onto a peaceful & quiet patio, overlooking a nice garden and pool and it felt glorious.  It was perfect for a relaxing, 5-course dinner.  No fake blue sky painted on the ceilings here.  No echos of mall shopping.  We could actually carry a conversation without having to yell, and we could sit back and enjoy the fresh air and sunshine on a gorgeous open air patio.  Why aren't there more restaurants like this on The Strip?  Of the five courses, the majority of them were very tasty and the meal included champagne, coffee and dessert.  The service was on-point and we were very well-attended to.  I will definitely be coming back to Verandah on my next trip to Vegas.",

We got to sit on the patio and it was a perfect setting...next to the pool. They started out with a bread/cracker basket with a wonderful white bean dip. The dip was so good we had to order seconds. We had a scrumptious salad. Normally I dislike blue cheese because it is a \"strong\" cheese; however, this salad had such a good combination of textures and flavors. The ice tea was spectacular as the ice cubes were made from ice tea. The sweet potato fries had just the right combination of sweetness and saltiness. Service was very good and very friendly. Overall, a very relaxing, pleasant visit.",

One of the better meals I had in Vegas.  The service, during what appeared to be a very slow night, was abysmal; inattentive and rushed (when it came time for the check), not well timed, and overall unimpressive.  I found myself having to look for someone when I needed something, like a glass of wine, and yet the check was presented to me without bothering to ask if there was anything else I would like.  There is too much competition in Vegas to return to a restaurant with bad service.",

I opted for the shrimp and lobster salad on wheat bread with salad and sweet potato fries on the side. Very delicious.",

Restaurant is thoroughly kid-friendly while not for a second compromising adults' menu choices; also Four Seasons-standard.  We had breakfast here each day and it was consistent and enjoyable, including both the a la carte menu and the buffet.  Highlights of the buffet on the day I ate include salmon and crab at the omelet bar and a donut bar!  We had lunch once and it was, for the price especially, remarkable.  The trio of tuna is great, and useful especially as a light lunch if you're going on to something big that night, and we also enjoyed the crab salad.  Finally, we had a nice pre-fix group dinner there one night.  Some quite creative items as well as a centerpiece meat and fish dishes that were tasty, just the right size in portion, and otherwise fully on target.  Nothing that really leaped out and demanded your attention to the extent that a fifth star would be in order, though.",

Lightyears different from any other strip and casino restaurant, Verandah provides a beautiful, calm and relaxing dining atmosphere. This is the place to go if you want to get away from your typical Vegas scene. Verandah has both indoor and outdoor seating. The indoor seating almost reminds me an island resort's restaurant... and the outdoor seating is beatiful and relaxing by the Four Season's quiet pool. The place has a Mediterranean garden feel to it which is really wonderful. Their food is a bit mediocre as far as Four Seasons dining goes but absolutely always hits the spot with a nice array of salads, sandwiches and other usual hotel restaurants offerings. I must recommend their Arnold Palmer - don't know what makes it so good but its a must try!",

    "text": "With an estimated group of 14 and no reservations for brunch on Father's Day, I pressed my luck and went to Verandah first to see if they could accommodate us. Behold my Vegas luck, someone with a group of 14 canceled and we would have a nice semi-private room for our group. Only downside would be that it would be inside. If you have a semi-small group or don't mind waiting, I'd recommend trying to get seated outside on a nice day. It's right next to the Four Seasons pool and seems very relaxing.   Some people in our group ordered a la crate and some got the brunch buffet. Two most impressive contraptions of the meal: the Donut Robot and the fresh peanut butter maker. The donut robot makes donuts by itself and the only need for a human being is to dip the donuts into toppings (but I'd recommend just trying a plain donut fresh). They had an omelette station that had both crab and lobster meat. Traditional breakfast buffet fare including frittatas, bread pudding, lots of fruits and pastries, etc... They also had fresh squeezed juices.   I guess the only negative was the cost. +$40 for the brunch buffet after tax/tip. Being in the Four Seasons hotel, I guess this is to be expected. However, still a reason for a dock of a star. I haven't really eaten at the other casino buffets for breakfast/brunch, so I can't really compare. But I'm fairly certain they're less expensive and might even offer more fare.",

Simply amazing.  The service was top notch, the food options were plentiful, the servings were tiny( (i have a lap band & a tight wedding gown to slide into) which allowed us to sample a little taste of everything.  The ambiance was perfect.  We enjoyed a bit of sunshine out on the pool while waiting for people to meet us.  The bill was steep, but this type of meal and day only happen one in a life time.  I highly recommend anyone visiting Las Vegas to make a date for brunch @ The Vernadah - it does not disappoint!  I only wish I could eat brunch there everyday.  Delicious!",

Had the Lox plate which is excellent, good portion size, fresh coffee served in a carafe left at the table. It was quiet and very relaxing !

The restaurant is rather small on the inside but when combined with the pool area veranda, the space is rather large.   The service is 4 Seasons quality (prompt and attentive). The wait staff even addressed me by name.   We arrived for a late brunch @ 1:45 pm on a Monday. Although they were wrapping up the lunch session, they were accommodating and allowed us to order from the breakfast menu. On top of that, they even allowed me to modify the order (off the menu).   The food is stellar but not excessively pricey! Although upscale, brunch was the same cost as House of Blues. The quality is far superior at Veranda however. Not to say that HOB is sub-par. It is not. Veranda however, used the freshest ingredients and has small touches that really make the food stand out. For example I received a side of liquid sugar with my iced tea.     Everything was perfect and I cant wait to go back!",

We had an average of 5 people coming to our table at rotation and it just got confusing between ordering and getting more drinks, desserts etc..  The one that brought our ticket, placed it on the table and then asked if we wanted dessert...lol you tony have to work in a restaurant to know what's wrong with that picture -__-  I won't be back, but that's mainly because the menu isn't already that spectacular so not much to return for...

My mission:  To order the wonderful and flavorful corned beef and pastrami hash I ate on my last visit in '08.  My friend and I made reservations just to be on the safe side, I mean who knows how busy a restaurant may or may not be on Sunday morning (hint:  don't worry if you DIDN'T make reservations for Sunday breakfast).    At first I thought we were going to be late because Las Vegas Blvd was closed for the marathon and so the police were diverting traffic elsewhere, in this case we made a u-turn and went back in the opposite direction we came from.  Thankfully we made it on time to for our 8am reservation.  One of the best things I've come to appreciate about Verandah is its location AWAY from the hustle and bustle of the Strip.  Since there isn't a casino in the Four Seasons, guests and visitors alike can enjoy the peace and serenity this restaurant has to offer.  And besides this tranquility, their service is just simply impeccable as well.  Everyone from the hostess to the servers make you feel very welcome and treat you like you're one of the Ocean's 11.  But now let's talk about the most important meal of the day:  Breakfast. Although there were other items on the menu that seemed appealing, as well as the buffet, we didn't deter from our mission and ordered our corned beef and pastrami hash.  Well, good things come to those who wait and this certainly was well worth waiting for.  Simply put:  One of the best breakfast meals I've ever had.  Bottom Line:  Peaceful.  Quiet.  Great Service.  Fantastic Breakfast.",

    "text": "Love this place! My friends and I were reluctant to spend $39 on brunch, but it paid off because we stuffed or faces and did not need to eat the rest of the day. We didn't realize the entire area was brunch, we stuck to the corner and were already full and overwhelmed with options, we got a second plate. Then realized there was an omelette station, dessert station, fruit, breads, etc. Our server was very nice and we got refills on orange juice, which was by the way the best and most fresh orange juice I've ever had. So much class and so much food, I would definitely recommend this place!",

There are too many other options that serve great food and don't charge you for carbonated water.",

    "text": "This review is based on the brunch only. I feel that a 3.5 would be more accurate, but hey, they have a Bloody Mary bar and a donut station. That alone is worth the overpriced buffet! And let's be honest, we are at Four Seasons here. Did you not expect overpriced? The service was also stellar, which made it easy to go with the 4 versus the 3 star rating.  My boyfriend and I went here randomly because we have heard many good things. They offer an a-la-carte menu as well as the buffet. The menu had pretty tempting options like chicken and waffles, and lemon ricotta pancakes, but who passes up the above mentioned in an AYCE setting?! Not me! The buffet was $39, or $51 if you want unlimited mimosas or marys. Also, I must mention their OJ is totally fresh squeezed, or at least tasted so. The buffet included many hot items, meats, eggs, potatoes. But the real winner here was the omelette station and/or the donut station. Chef on hand to whip you up an egg dish of your choice. Love it. I also like all the yogurt, granola, and cheeses. You could taste the quality.  We ended up ordering the pancakes, and they were fluffy, moist, and yummy. But not worth $20. I will stick to the buffet next time.  Also, I would avoid this place during conventions, I could imagine the tourist taking advantage of a classy buffet such as this.",

The outdoor patio is a lovely space, shaded from the direct sunlight, yet open and airy.  Service was very attentive and patient as we had a fairly leisurely meal.  Their ice tea was infused with passion fruit giving it an incredibly refreshing flavor.  I chose a simple dish a tuscan-style tomato soup and a grilled cheese sandwich.  The soup was thick, seasoned nicely and very hearty.  I used the extra crusty bread brought to our table for dunking...just perfect!  The sandwich appeared to be grilled on either a grate or in a panini press; either way it had an unusual combination of cheese that made the sandwich unique and unlike any grilled cheese I'd had before.  i also paired well with the soup.  A beautiful setting and a delicious meal made for a great afternoon.",

    "text": "**This review is only for afternoon tea service at the Veranda**  There are a few places to get high tea in Las Vegas, with the Veranda being one of them. We came at 3:00 pm on a weekday and we were one of only 2 other tables that came for tea service. While it was a beautiful day outside on the patio, unfortunately tea service was limited to stay inside.  For $35, you get a choice of teas to chose from, followed three tiers of plates of little snacks and sandwiches. Supposedly you work your way down from the scones to the savory sandwiches and bites, down to the sweet pastries. You can also add on an additional plate of food for $5, but the snacks were actually quite filling.   My favorite was actually the scones, which were served with fresh Devonshire cream, lemon curd and house made strawberry preserves. They were some of the most buttery and crumbly scones I've ever had. These were followed by a number of tea sandwiches including smoked salmon, scallion caper cream cheese on pumpernickel bread, a cucumber & green olive tapenade on sourdough bread, chicken apple salad on sesame cone, and an egg & dill salad on tomato brioche. While they were all quite delicious, the breads all tasted somewhat stale and old. The tea pastries included a milk chocolate & candied orange velvet cake, a fresh strawberry & Sicilian pistachio tart (my favorite!), almond & pear tart, and a \"no bake\" vanilla bean cheesecake.   For organic teas, there were a number of choices including orange pekoe, traditional English breakfast, organic assam, Russian earl grey, black currant, golden jasmine blossoms, golden chamomile flowers, mountain terry tisane, and silver leaf. I chose the earl grey, which had nice citrus notes of orange and lemon. Many commented that the tea was much better and stronger than the teas served at the Mandarin Oriental.   You get a little more bang for your buck and it's $10 cheaper than the Tea Lounge at MO, but you miss out on the amazing view there. They also lack in some of the details with chipped tea pots and the such at Veranda that probably would not have gone unnoticed at MO. Free valet parking that you could get validated at Veranda.",

We both got the turkey dinner. We actually brought our own wine and I am glad we did because the waiter told us the wine pairing was horrible that night. We went early and there was nobody there.   The food came out really quick and it was ok. I was bummed because almost every single item served had cinnamon in it. I am allergic to cinnamon so it was difficult for me to eat. It was shocking how much cinnamon they used.   Oh well-- the desserts were good but also the same problem. We had to leave right away because I was having a reaction to the cinnamon.   I guess I won't go here for holiday meals, but I will try again for the regular menu.",

The staff were extremely helpful and the food was simply spectacular. Starting with a superb cocktail (old fashioned) we moved on to fried calamari appetizer that was crisp and not a bit oily. One of our party had the seared tuna appetizer in a dinner portion that was so fresh and accompanied by flavors that highlighted the tuna. Really good. I had the tenderloin with caramelized onions; so tender it was the best beef I've had in at least a year. We had the potatoes and mushrooms in marsala sauce on the side; surprising flavors that were perfect in accompaniment to the beef. The portions were so generous (along with the bread) that we had no room for what looked like delicious desserts. The only surprise was how reasonable the check was when compared to what we'd have paid in many other gourmet restaurants.",

While waiting to be seated I overheard a patron without reservations fussing because the restaurant could not accommodate his party. Shortly after his loud protest, he and his party of 5 were seated at an outdoor table. My family and I were next to be seated and to my disappointment we were told that outdoor seating was full and not available.  This was quite upsetting since the group before us did not have reservations and they were seated outdoors. I felt like they were at our table and to express my concern about the situation, I requested to speak to the manager, Mr. Todorovic. He was quite dismissive and exhibited micro aggressions towards me and my family.  On a 1 -10 customer relations rating scale, the manager gets a \"zero\" from me.  Fortunately and after a little wait time, the hostess was able to find outdoor seating for us. In spite of the manager's rudeness, we had a very nice time. The ambiance was great; the food selection was adequate; and the waiting staff was extremely attentive.",

    "text": "It was this place where we had the best breakfast of my life. And I am not exaggerating, this place cooks up a good meal! We came here right after waking up, on our spur of the moment trip to Vegas. It was a short walk from Mandalay Bay and into the Four Seasons Hotel. The two resorts are connected, so there was no need to venture into the street. After the short walk, we checked in with the host and were seated. Since it was a chilly morning, we ate inside. The place is elegantly decorated, clean, and staffed by attentive workers.  We had some lattes and water while we decided what to order. We ordered our food, which came out about twenty minutes later. While the wait was a little longer than usual, the quality more than made up for this. The food was amazing! And I say this about every part of the meal! It was very delicious, and left me feeling full for quite some time after. Please see pics. The staff was friendly and efficient. We were taken cared of very well, and left very happy. I commend their good quality, and recommend this place to my friends and family.",

We \"brunched\" at Veranda. For the life of me I don't know why! My third choice Rigatoni with a decent ragu $26. The rigatoni was severely overcooked. My first choice was not to eat here. My second choice was not to eat but they ran out of Blanton's. Hope that they learn how to cook pasta and stock their bar better.",

I was impressed with the variety of food that they offered in this restaurant.I went back here again with my friend for a la carte breakfast.We get a compliment fruit plate from the Garde Manger Chef and it was good.  The third& fourth time here for me was for lunch when I had relatives and friend in town.I would say a lunch menu here is not that special, but for sure the taste and quality is above average.The service is also good during lunch time.  By the way,I do visited this restaurant again for dinner for my friend Claudette's birthday.I ordered a 3 course Italian meal(Made by chef Antonio).I would say Italian dishes here are one of the best in Las Vegas so far.My pasta was al dente and other dishes were yummy.Food display and garnished make my dishes even more delicious.   So have here for breakfast,lunch and dinner and I have to say top class and want to give it a five star rating.I will definitely come back here again.",

My boo surprised me with a breakfast buffet and from the minute we walked in, I felt we were treated like high rollers.   Verandah is situated inside the Four Seasons and right beside the pool.  Should you wish to people watch and bask in the sun, then the verandah of the Verandah (see what I did there?) would be your ideal spot.  Otherwise, I'd suggest you bathe in the luxury of elegant decor, white linens, and a relaxed eat-at-your-own-pace ambiance of  their indoor dining area.   You are not obligated to partake in their breakfast buffet, as there was separate menu  that featured the usual breakfast fare.   After being seated by the friendly hostess, our server took our drink orders.  We then galloped to the buffet area to feast!  The buffet was relatively small Eggs Benedict, eggs, and bacon.  I was surprised with the quality of Eggs Benedict.  I'm not a connoisseur of EB, but damn.  The biscuit was crunchy!  I did not expect it to have texture if it had been sitting in a food heater/water bath all morning.  That was a good surprise.  I'm not a fan of drip coffee, but damn, even the coffee was good.    Some stand-out items were the scrambled eggs with smoked salmon, peppered bacon, French Toast with berry compote, vanilla bread pudding, and assorted pastries like blueberry scones with lemon curd.  Yummy in my tummy!  Also Included in the buffet menu was custom-made omelettes.  I ordered mine made with spinach and other standard accoutrements you would put in any omelette.  One thing I MUST note  was my spinach was cooked PERFECTLY in the omelette.  In all other omelettes I have had that included the green, leafy powerhouse, the spinach had been cooked into nothing and offered no *textural* contrast to my omelette.  Oh, but at the Verandah, you see, my omelette was perfection!   Another area that exceeded my expectations was the efficacy and professionalism of the staff.    My coffee was constantly refilled and other servers (including our own) periodically asked about our food and our experience without being too invasive or too fake.   I was having trouble cutting the biscuit of my Eggs Benedict with a dull dinner knife and our server noticed and handed me a steak knife so that I could cut through the biscuit (I couldn't, but I much appreciated the gesture). It just seemed that everyone we encountered was genuinely interested in our dining experience!  That's always a plus for me and makes for a glowing review on Yelp.",

No way that this is better than Mozen, which closed their amazing Sunday brunch except for special occasions. Veranda brunch has limited items. Cannot compare to the other big buffets in Vegas in terms of variety. I expected better from Four Seasons.",

The crab retained its texture and did not gum together like one which is made of all bread crumbs. The aioli is on the heavy side. The salmon was cooked to perfection. A beautiful medium with a nice warm center. It broke apart without flaking everywhere. The use of dressing was light and the flavors of the artichoke and other vegetables were present. The tuna three ways was okay. I am not a huge roll type of person, so I could do without it. The upside was that they did not skimp of the center. It was predominantly spicy tuna. The poke was decent. Nothing spectacular. The thick slices seared was the best of the offerings.",

No matter where you are or how stressful life is, getting a cocktail at their bars, eating at their restaurants, or sleeping on those amazing beds will remove that stress in your life and make life seem, almost perfect and well deserved.  The Verandah promised this upon entry for breakfast.  The classy and understated decor, the beautiful tones that screams taste, and the nice welcome from the staff.  After a week long of craziness in Vegas, we came here to transition back to ourselves before getting on a plane to leave.  The Verandah did not disappoint.  The food was very good, the service friendly.  But since FS to me is of certain standard, I did take a star away because even after explaining to our server that I would simply like omelets with no hash brown or toast, it still came with those items.  Since I am in a low carb diet that day, this was simply torturous as those perfectly crisp, carefully trimmed hash browns beckoned to me throughout my meal.  Somebody has to pay for that torture, and voila, there's a star off!    I will definitely be back when I am allowed carbs again and will definitely try their afternoon tea.  Ta-ta!",

While the room appears lovely, with windows overlooking the elegantly styled Four Season's pool, the bar itself is non-descript with nothing special about it.  Service was preumptory, with no personality and light pours.  The experience was so banal, that I would be concerned with dining here.  Thus, while I'm staying at the Four Seasons, I will avoid eating at Veranda.  Besides, it's a lousy name for an Italian restaurant.",

In particular, the cucumber sandwiches. The desserts are very good also just not my personal favorite. They also had them decorated for Easter. The tea itself is also very good, medium selection. If you like sweet teas I would recommend the mountain berry. And if you like green tea I would recommend the jasmine blossom tea. The staff are very nice and attentive. I would rate the experience a 10/10.",

    "text": "We came here for a quick lunch on a weekday. Note that they only have buffet on weekends, and then only till 1pm. The dishes are on the expensive side, but what do you expect? It's connected to 4 seasons. We had 3 dishes:  The margarita pizza (I think that's what it's called) - I thought this one wasn't great, though the girlfriend thought it was the best dish. The bread of the pizza felt a bit too soft, and the sauce plus pizza was lacking. Maybe I'm just being too picky since I'm biased towards NY pizza.   Shrimp tacos - these were great, the shrimp was big and fresh, and the lemon and avocado sauce was interesting. I prefer the taco toasted a bit more, but overall I can recommend this dish.   Seafood mac and cheese - This was the highlight of the lunch. They did not skimp on the seafood, with chunks of lobster, scallop and shrimp. I devoured it in minutes. Girlfriend did not enjoy it though, so it may be an acquired taste.   Overall, I give the food a solid 3. The extra star is for the service, our server was very at tentative and checked on us several times to make sure we were ok.",

The restaurant will validate your ticket for you so parking is free.  My friend parked at Mandalay Bay because she is an Mlife member.    Tea is served in Veranda, the restaurant next to Charlie Palmer Steakhouse.  They also serve lunch during tea, so you will see and smell different food coming out.  So while this isn't an elegant or particularly refined setting for tea, it is still quiet and relaxing.   The tea selection is not huge but well rounded with a total of 6 teas.  I tried the Ruby Oolong and Silver Needle, which were both very developed in both flavor and aroma.  They refresh your hot water and the pots have a way to lift your tea leaves out of the water when it has reached your preferred steep.   The food consists of 4 types of sandwich, 4 types of pastries, and two types of scones.   - The scones (sweet cream and currant) were delectable paired with a perfect Devonshire cream, seedless strawberry jam, and lemon curd. - The sandwiches varied between perfect (roast beef and smoked salmon), good (turkey), and average (cucumber). - The lemon bar was exceptional!  The rest were just average.  Ricky was our main server, friendly and attentive. Teresa chased me out to my car when I forgot my phone at the table.  Wonderful service!",

    "text": "Veranda and The Four Seasons in general is one of my favorite and often overlooked spots in Vegas.   The Four Seasons is beautiful and set back just far enough from Las Vegas Boulevard to make you feel like you've entered a peaceful oasis. Veranda is a short walk from the main entrance. Parking is valet only, but Veranda can validate the parking after you dine with them. The valets and employees at the entrance really make you feel welcome when you arrive and are very professional.   A variety of visits have proven to be five star experiences. I've dined here a couple of times for the Sunday brunch buffet (also offered on Saturdays), enjoyed a weekday lunch, and my friend hosted my baby shower in a private room here. All of the experiences were excellent, with both the food and the exceptional service.   My baby shower at Veranda was perfect. My friend did the best job choosing the details and planning while the staff perfectly executed the details. The staff was so professional and really went above and beyond to get everything right. The almond cake was one of the best I've ever had and was decorated beautifully, exactly as requested. All three courses of the meal were delicious and beautifully plated. Having dined there before I knew the food would be good, but they really wowed with the presentation.   Lunch is extra special at Veranda. The menu is excellent in selection and taste. As always, the service was friendly and professional. We enjoyed the Sicilian Meatball appetizer, Fungi Pizza, Bolognese Pasta, No Bake Pumpkin Cheesecake, and Chocolate Lollipops. The favorites of what we ordered were definitely the Fungi Pizza and the No Bake Pumpkin Cheesecake.   The weekend brunch buffet is delicious, my favorite part is the pastries. They offer amazing bread pudding, cinnamon rolls, and miniature donuts. Standard breakfast options are offered like eggs, bacon, and pancakes. They also offer small plates of dishes like chilaquiles and chicken and waffles. There's plenty to choose from and even a table of selections for kids.   The only thing left on my Veranda bucket list is the daily afternoon tea. I'll be back!",

Both events were held in the same small private room and had different food service but they were both excellent.   The SHERO event was Afternoon Tea and they do a very nice one! I am an Afternoon Tea snob and I will give my 'Two Thumbs Up' with the tea service at Veranda. The courses were on point of choice of tea, scones, finger sandwiches and little pastries. Everything was delicious with several options to munch on.  As for the most recent event, I came in for a baby shower and it was a Class Act Shower. The details were fantastic from the personalized menu, the delicious courses and the Baby Shower cake provided. The cake was sliced and presented beautifully with additional berries.  For both events, the service was great and our servers kept the afternoon flowing. I am definitely giving Veranda a Five Star recommendation especially for those looking for a small private event that is frilly, pretty and tasty!",

Menu had great choices with fresh produce and photogenic presentation, and staff were attentive. The caprese app, blackened salmon salad, and fruit tart were all solid dishes from their lunch menu. Based on the food and service, I would return for brunch or another meal here- they also have HH 4-7PM and a (reservation-required) afternoon tea service!

The place is beautiful and the service is A+. The food is perfect ( but if you're into a lot of greasy breakfast this is not the place for you ) some of the food they have on the buffet table are portioned out for you so you can do a grab and go, you can also choose to do patio seating and it is by the pool side ( not great to do this on summer season here in Vegas) great view. They also have fresh pressed juices and other menu you can choose from if you choose not to have the buffet brunch. Plus, and if you have a hang over from hard partying the night before they have awesome Bloody Mary's. This place is a bit of an upscale breakfast place so don't be coming in here looking like you haven't gotten back to your  room to clean up or just came back from the walk of shame hall. Food is good !!!!!!ooooh you have to try their mini donuts and great shell eggs at the omelette stations. Yum! It's a must to eat here. $$",

    "text": "Veranda is the fine dining restaurant at the Four Seasons Las Vegas specializing in Italian cuisine. From reading other reviews of Veranda, one would assume it is merely a brunch spot, and after visiting this restaurant for a grown-up meal, I can see why no one is talking about their offerings beyond benedicts and beignets.  Chef Joel Ott is responsible for the food at Veranda. Having previously worked locally in lesser roles at Le Cirque, Allegro, and Sinatra, Ott inherited the kitchen from Naples-born Antonio Minichiello, who departed in 2017. I am not one to demand on the ethnicity of my food match with the ethnicity of my chef (since most of the people doing the actual cooking are Hispanic anyway), but it does seem odd that a job at such a high-profile Italian restaurant on the Vegas Strip went to a guy from Toledo, Ohio.  Astonishingly, after pondering my menu options, I found nothing Italian that seemed particularly compelling. I started with the zuppa del giorno: a yellow tomato gazpacho with avocado and supposedly bacon. I say \"supposedly\" because my tongue couldn't find any texture of pork belly or taste of smoke. This was a shame, because it was boring without it. The tomatoes were neither sweet nor acetic enough, and by the time my spoon reached the bottom of the bowl, I was not inclined to scrape the sides.  On, then, to my next course: a \"Tuna Sampler\" featuring spice-rubbed sashimi, a \"spicy\" tuna roll, and ahi tartare. While I found the ahi tartare and spicy tuna roll pleasing due to their spicy heat and seasonings, the spice-rubbed sashimi was served much too cold to be palatable. These types of mistakes should not happen in a restaurant like this.  My final non-Italian course at this Italian restaurant was an Asian-themed \"Roasted Striped Bass,\" served with root vegetables in a lemongrass shrimp broth. Striper is a good choice for serving in a broth due to its dense meatiness and rich flavor, and I was looking forward to a preparation that would complement its sometimes strong seawater-like taste. What I got was passable, but I found the liquid thin and non-assertive; a more competent kitchen would have better-seasoned or spiced the broth.  The service here is respectful but ultimately underwhelming for a Four Seasons restaurant. When my plates were placed in front of me, a laundry list of ingredients were perfunctorily rattled off, but any questions I asked could not be addressed, as my wait-staff didn't actually know the food they were serving very well. Surprisingly there was no attempt or offer to go back to the kitchen and get answers.  At most Four Seasons hotels I've stayed at, the restaurant is world-class. In fact, Veranda earned a 4-star rating from Forbes, which implies it is on par with other 4-star fine dining restaurants in Las Vegas such as Michael Mina, L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon, Mizumi, and Sage. I must unfortunately report that Veranda does not belong on this list and does not belong in a Four Seasons hotel. Nothing at Veranda, from the food to the ambiance to the service, is impressive. If I knew nothing of this restaurant and simply materialized in the middle of it for a meal, I would assume I was drugged \"B.A. Baracus\"-style by cruel enemies and propped up on a chair so I would be forced to eat dinner at a mediocre house restaurant in a suburban Marriott. You need to fix this, Four Seasons - this restaurant is hurting your brand.  Food/Decor/Service: 3.3/3.9/3.7",

The staff is extremely friendly, and ready to refill your water glass or juice glass! The omelette bar is wonderful and made to order as you like it. Be sure to ask for the shrimp and crab! I like that I can also get just egg whites as well. There is also a fresh donut area... with all the sprinkles you could ever want. Watch them come right out of the fryer. There is a nice variety of dishes including quiche, chicken and waffles, and  lox and bagels with all the toppings!! The fresh fruit and bakery display is beautiful and always fresh! The pecan rolls are the BEST anywhere!!  The restaurant is clean and the service is excellent!! I will be back!",

    "text": "It took me a while to write this review, I went for brunch the 1st Sat in April.  Let's start out by reminding you that this is my all-time favorite place for brunch buffet and I've been frequenting for 5 years now, and have given it as my #1 referral to anyone who asks for recommendations... But... I'm extremely sad to say, I probably won't be back. They've changed everything, from the layout to the food. The blintzes, chicken n waffles, mini donuts, mini cornbeef and hash remain.  They've moved the yogurt and fruits from the bar to a small deli case where everything is already prepared for you. None of it looked appealing except for one, but it was 3x the size of what I wanted so I didn't get it. You used to be able to make your own. The mini frittata was bland and not worth eating, but was better than most other stuff so that's what I had. The replacement chilaquiles was inedible which was a major disappointment.  Lastly, we were sat up against the building wall, we usually sit against a pillar (2-top), those tables are no longer there. It took me almost the entire brunch to pinpoint why the atmosphere felt so off - this change in seating totally disrupted what I loved most about coming here. I always felt like I was on vacation (beach) and not stuck in this waterless desert city, but that totally changed sitting so far back.  Sorry for the 4-tops that were sitting there all these years, guess we all need to have our day; but I'm mourning the loss of my favorite weekend getaway :( I'm all for change, but ultimately the quality of the dishes really fell off and I can't bring myself to go through the pain of it all again.  I really feel like I lost my friend.  In a city that can't hold a candle to my home state in the cuisine department, I had 2 favs (El Dorado and Veranda's brunch) that I've had to say goodbye to... boooo!",

When we got there nothing on the menu sounded very good to us so we went over and ate here at Veranda instead.  Best choice ever!!!    We had the beet appetizer, pea risotto, the chicken dish, and the eggplant ravioli.  All of them were amazing!!  The chicken was flattened and then rolled up with spinach in the middle.  The sauce on it was yummy!!  The chicken was very tender.  The potatoes that car with it were phenomenal.  The ravioli was hand made by the chef.  They were so fresh and tasty.   The risotto was delicious!!!  We love risotto but it's really hard to find a restaurant that can malt right.  This place nailed it!!  Was al Dante and cooked to perfection!!  The service was great!!  Our main server was very nice, Helpful, and knowledgeable.  There were other people helping bring out our food and filling our water.  They were all very pleasant.  We will definitely go back next time we're in Vegas!!",

The food was good, but expensive for what we got.  The doughnut station was my favorite, but we didn't get an omelette because no one was at the station when we came by. We waited for about 10 min, but he didn't come back. I felt like one mimosa was too expensive when you can get bottomless at some places for $10.   The service was our biggest issue. Our plates weren't cleared and water wasn't refilled unless we flagged someone down. We also waited a long time to close out after we asked for our check.",

Their bacon is ihop bacon...their bellini mix does not taste natural at all...the french toast might of been the only decent thing I got here.   Service is meh, almost like the servers take their time to judge you, glad I am confusing enough to feel like they never settled in with me.   I should of stuck to Tableau for a good breakfast at the Wynn, but Vegas is a never ending learning experience, if you trust me, trust me that Veranda is a pump fake attempt, just don't fall for it because you'll end up fouling.",

    "text": "It is likely by design that many locals and visitors do not even realize Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts owns property in Las Vegas, the luxury brand out of Toronto choosing to maintain a quiet presence as part of Mandalay Bay without any gaming but instead several amenities plus two Restaurants including Charlie Palmer Steak and Italian-themed Veranda.  Found at The Strip's south end, separate access from the Boulevard paired to valet parking while cost-conscious guests may prefer to use Mandalay Bay self-park and walk, it is as one passes from Mandalay's lobby to Four Seasons that both music and decor shift, everything suddenly smoother while a curved staircase and elevators await en route to the first floor where restaurants and Press Cafe are found.  Visiting Veranda on this particular Saturday, a previous Brunch and Dinner each pre-dating Chef Joel Ott's arrival, it was with reservations confirmed that two guests were led to a table at room's center, a cheerful captain quickly arriving  to take Beverage orders and explain the a la carte menu versus Buffet option.  Currently charging $39 for the weekend-only Buffet, included Juice and Coffee plus made-to-order Omelettes an unmistakable bargain compared to individual items ranging $12-$22, it was with a daily Juice of Watermelon and Lime poured that a scouting mission took place, the collection concise and elegantly presented across cold and hot stations plus made-to-order Donut and Pastry carts.  Selecting a plate as staff refreshed stations with new items, the 3/4 full room never loud even as guests partook in bottomless Blood Marys, it was on return to the table with Charcuterie, Cheese and house-smoked Salmon that a large glass of Sangria was offered, the $18 addition nearly twice the volume served elsewhere and very refreshing as Italian Bubbles were balanced by Citrus plus Peach Schnapps.  Sipping Sangria with savories and Coffee as a compliment to sweeter items it was on a second plate that Apple Pancakes were stacked next to Chicken and Waffles, the unexpected surprise of Bacon in the Batter nicely complimenting Sage fried Bird while an Apple Danish and dainty Brioche Muffin kissed by Sea Salt each attested to a Pastry cart that would warrant further attention.  Told by the other diner that both Parfaits and Chia Pudding were memorable, the former in particular thanks to fresh Persimmon and Dried Apricot, it was in addition to these that Museli and self-assembled Granola were tasted, the latter available with or without nuts and only minimally sweetened though pure Maple Syrup, Organic Honey and even housemade Jam are available to add as desired.  Returning to savories, Scrambled Eggs, Hash Browns and Breakfast Potatoes all passed by to preserve capacity, those seeking Bacon or Sausage will be happy to know that two varieties of each are available while small plates nearby are highlighted by Chilaquiles, the unfortunate use of heat lamps compromising the texture of Corned Beef Hash that was nicely flavored but far too dry.  At this point opting to add an a la carte option, $19 French Toast straight from Chef Ott presenting two thick slices of custardy Brioche beneath boozy Pineapples and Tres Leches Whipped Cream, it was after enjoying each pillowy bite that more sweets were gathered, the Scones kept in a steamer rich with Butter while freshly made Blintzes, warm Sticky Buns and golden Croissants filled with Nutella were all good enough to warrant seconds.   Sated but not full, the fact that all items are offered in reasonable portions allowing even those of limited appetites to indulge in a variety, it was setting aside coarse Poppyseed Loaf that attention instead focused on two styles of Coffee Cake, a preference for Raspberry based on nothing but personal taste as both were moist and crumbly while Muffins were appropriately softer and more dense.    Not about to pass on warm Donuts, each but a mouthful and the sprinkled round reminiscing of Sundays after Church as a child, it was after six of these airy bites that any remaining space was filled by Bread Pudding, the top a toasty landscape capable of standing up to Vanilla Anglaise while the base yields nearly-molten Custard imbued by melted pieces of Dark Chocolate.",

The salmon, lots of internal fat, pronounced sweet smoke with just the right amount of bitterness, rich, soft, silky, velvety smooth as it melts on your tongue.  Wow!    The donuts, fresh fried, still warm, ethereally crispy on the outside moist, cakey fluffiness on the inside. Drizzle them or top them anywhere you like, naked is superb.  Add a bagel and the usual condiments for the salmon, a bowl of fresh seasonal berries, a plate of ripe melons, some cheese and charcuterie. A right, proper breakfast buffet in Vegas.  You don't like my choices? Well everything else Is mediocre. Pancakes, bennies, quiche that have become rubbery from being warmed, room temp waffles and dry, over spiced chicken tenders, piles of rubbery gourmet bacon and oddly flavored limp sausages, AC dried baked goods.  Very inconsistent service. Sometimes Four Seasons proper, friendly, efficient, always greeting you by name. Other times absent minded and clumsy.  The weekend breakfast manager needs re-training.  Never argue with the guest.  I was dissatisfied, told the server to just run my credit card so I could leave.  Problem solved, Instead the manager took it upon himself to come to the table carry on about how he is right and I'm wrong.  His actions cut the servers tip in half.  $39 for outstanding smoke salmon and mini donuts with the chance to gamble on service?  It's Vegas!  The choice is yours.",

    "text": "Anyone who knows me can tell you I HATE BUFFETS!   There are a few different reasons I dislike buffets here are just a few: -I don't like mixing different types of food in one meal. -I don't like fetching my own food when paying to dine out. -I don't like \"community food\" forums like potlucks or buffets because of the whole germ factor.  We flew into Vegas on an early Saturday morning flight and upon checking into our room at the Four Seasons we went down to Veranda mostly based on sheer convenience, but I had also read and heard great things about the weekend brunch. We were there on a Saturday which isn't as popular of a day for brunch as Sunday is so it wasn't crowded. In fact we were one of the first people to enter the dinning room so that helped me navigate the \"community food germs\" concern. Since all of the food featured fell into the \"breakfast category the type of food I'd be mixing was also fairly limited. This only left me having to content with the \"fetching my own food\" issue which I sucked up!   I'm so glad I put aside my issues and gave this place a shot because I LOVED it!!! The food options were limited compared to other buffets which believe it or not is a plus in my book. Every item I tried (and I didn't even get to them all) was delicious and amazing. Even the mountain berry tea I had blew me away. No other buffet has impressed me the way this one did. I've been coming to Las Vegas for over 30 years and have visited my fair share of buffets but this visit to Veranda clinched the deal. I can now confidently say \"the only buffet I'll go to is the weekend brunch at Veranda\".",

I've recently started eating a gluten free diet, but that hasn't deterred me from enjoying this hidden gem!   They have your typical options such as eggs, omelettes, etc, but they go above and beyond by offering specialties like a Gluten Free Sampler and Gluten Free Mini Belgian Waffles (probably the best I've had)! Veranda is also very accommodating when it comes to transforming any dish into a gluten friendly option; I've done this several times with the Eggs Benedict. They also have gluten free toast!   Gluten free options aside, Veranda offers a breakfast buffet with all of your usual offerings, but with plenty of specialties as well! They even have a Donut Bar which can be dangerously addictive.   Veranda checks all of the boxes when it comes to having a perfect breakfast. It's arguably the best breakfast in town if you're wanting to eat gluten free, and the prices are fairly reasonable for the quality. I've had nothing but wonderful experiences, and I'll continue going back!",

Although I did like my salad first-course, others in the group weren't so lucky.  One person's scallops were over-cooked and rubbery, and the caprese salad was so salty it couldn't be eaten.  More mixed reviews on the main dishes.  The short-ribs were a hit and people liked the oxtail ravioli, but the skin on my sea bass was soggy instead of a nice, crunchy texture, and someone had undercooked chicken that had to be sent back.  The worst part of the evening?  The service.  Our waiter came by twice in roughly an hour - first to give us menus, then to take our orders.  Even though it took about 90 minutes to get our dinners, he never came back to ask if we wanted more drinks, say it's coming, etc.  And there were only 4 other parties in the restaurant!  When we finally complained to the manager, there was no apology - simply a head nod.  Truly disappointing.  The apology only came awkwardly during the THIRD conversation with the manager, after the raw chicken had to be sent back.  Then came the after dinner chocolates - they brought 6. For a group of 7. This was possibly the worst service I've ever experienced.  It's a real negative mark on the Four Season's luxury brand.    Because I like to leave things on a positive note, the drinks were great, as was the bread basket.",

When we walked in we were really impressed with all the seating.  Outdoors they have a mix of cool patio furniture and tables.  We didn't know what to expect when it came to the food but we were blown away.  There were three people in our party so we had only bought one TZ voucher.  The chef sent out tastes of everything we were eating so our third guest could also experience the 5-course meal.  Everything was plated beautifully and the taste of the food was DEVINE!  It was a dining experience, so we took our time to take it all in.  The staff were all very attentive making sure our waters and wine were replenished.  Everyone agreed that we will be visiting Verandah again when we go back to Vegas!",

The food would be often served in a tiered stand.\"  Verandah afternoon tea makes you feel like you are not in vegas anymore. Everything is so quiet and peaceful. Of course the price tag $30/ per person is abit steep for afternoon tea but what do you expect from having afternoon tea in four season in United States?  Finally, you had to reserved in advance for the afternoon tea since the sandwich and pastry are hand made daily by their pastry chef.",

My husband was so upset that he spent $35 on the brunch buffet and didn't like anything besides the donuts! I had the huevos rancheros and it was mediocre at best. As for the service, the waiters approached about 3 times to take our order in the first minute we sat down, before we had a chance to read the menu, and then didn't come back for a while. My husband used 3 plates to visit the buffet, and not one plate was cleared until I stood up to leave. It was a complete disappointment and I would only recommend going for perhaps a morning coffee, just for the beautiful setting.",

While the atmosphere was nice and the service was quick and friendly, the food was certainly nothing to write home about, especially at the prices they charge. The weekend brunch costs $35 per person, $42 if you want a mimosa or bloody mary. They had a decent selection of brunch options, but not as large as many of the other brunches on the Strip. And while the selection was ok, none of the food was spectacular. Just a heads up, if you're looking for an incredible Las Vegas brunch, this isn't the place to go.",

    "text": "Verandah is the best breakfast/ brunch buffet in Vegas, hands down.  It is more pricey than most other places on the strip, including the Bellagio and Wynn.  That being said, the quality of the food and the setting could not be better.  It's located in the Four Seasons hotel and has a very tropical feel.  They have outdoor seating on gorgeous patio furniture, with palm trees and misters that create a lush and humid environment.  The buffet does not have the plethra of selections that you would find at Bellagio or others, but they are not going for the cheesy Vegas buffet experience where you wait in line for hours and gorge yourself.  The food is beautiful- a huge selection of pastries including plain and almond croissants, pain au chocolat, fruit danishes, cinnamon rolls, brioche, muffins, and lovely coffee cakes.  They have bagels with lox and all the fixings.  There is fresh fruit plated in glass cups (greek yogurt and granola parfaits, macerated citrus segments, fresh seasonal berries, etc).  There is a made-to-order egg and omelette station and about 10 chaffing dishes with eggs benedict, breakfast meats, vegetarian quiches and fritattas, cheese blintzes, and a delicious bread pudding.  Best of all, there is a donut station with a chef preparing hot cake donuts by the minute and glazing them with icing, chocolate, coconut, nuts, etc.  They are small, crisp, delicate and delicious.  Your brunch is served with their fresh juice of the day (which is usually a blend of melons and berries).  They use iced tea ice cubes in their iced tea, a major plus in my book.  Whenever we have peeps in town or it's a special occasion, this is the first place we head to.  Brunch at Verandah is not to be missed.",

Service was courteous and everything we ordered was delicious. We started off with beef tartare, which was incredible. The signature pasta (served beautifully in a jar) and four cheese pizza also did not disappoint. For dessert, we had the panna cotta trio and loved each individual flavor. I am looking forward to coming back here again and trying out the brunch menu and happy hour specials!  The only negative was that they charged us for every single soda refill. Most standard restaurants don't charge for soda refills, so I would think for a high class restaurant where you're paying an easy $30+ per person, they wouldn't be so stingy on that sort of thing. Not to mention each drink was always loaded with ice, hence why we needed so many refills.",

The brunch keeps getting better and it seems like they add more food each time.   We always sit outside by the pool. This year they offered the normal brunch foods inside. Outside, there was a hot dog/Philly cheesesteak station, pizza station, taco cart, meats, etc. The only bad thing I could say about their food is that the sushi wasn't good. But when is sushi at a brunch ever good? Rice is cold and it just kinda sits out. So that's not a real complaint.  Staff came around offering non-alcoholic sangria in plastic bags which I thought was so cute. I didn't like the taste but it was a neat idea. There was also Las Vegas distillery & brewery there on Father's Day to offer tastings!  I love this place. We will come back every year for the mothers/day Father's Day brunch even though it's a bit pricey. $80 per adult, and I believe my 3 year old was like $16. He didn't eat much. Forgot to mention the infamous donut station; freshly fried and dipped to your liking!! My son was all about it.  Service is top notch. Food is great.",

    "text": "This place is awesome!! It's pretty much hidden inside the Four Seasons hotel.  I've never been to the Four Seasons for all the years I've been to Vegas.  I decided to look for a really good Sunday brunch place. After searching for an hour or so, I decided to go to Verandah.  Finding parking without valet was a bit challenging at the Four Seasons.  I managed to find a huge parking lot that was south of the hotel.  I wasn't sure if it was for the Mandalay Bay beach resort or for the Four Seasons but I parked there anyways.  There didn't seem to have any signs at all what it was for.  If you drive towards the entrance of the Four Seasons, it's valet only.  The restaurant is located on the left after you go inside, past the PRESS cafe, which supposedly has really good cronuts.  When I got there on Sunday, it was already sold out, so I couldn't try it.  I booked a reservation with opentable before coming to the restaurant.  The server was pretty attentive and got me seated within a few mins of arriving.  The place wasn't packed at all but had a decent amount of people.  I seat outside, which was next to the pool area.  It was blocked off with some trees, so the patrons at the pool weren't bothersome.  After digging through the menu, I opted for the buffet brunch.  It was $40 with unlimited drinks, if you wanted Mimosas and such, you need to pay about $10 more.    As I scoured through the food, everything looked good.  I tried almost everything and I had to say, it was good!  The scrambled eggs with salmon were perfect, not too much salt and had the perfect taste.    The food varieties for the brunch ranged from banana pancakes, eggs benedicts to fresh made mini donuts (check the photo).  The waiter service was prompt and they automatically refilled my drink when I went for another round of food.  I would highly recommend this place!",

It's not that anything is wrong with their breakfast but it is just ridiculously overpriced. Avocado toast for $22?! I could have made it myself for like $2. There was nothing special or amazing about it. There are so many other better brunch places in this city so will probably not return very often did breakfast but definitely will for happy hour. And while the Four Seasons does charge for valet now, they will validate your valet if you dine at the restaurant so you don't have to pay the steep parking charges",

We sat outside on both occasions and the staff makes sure you are comfortable, whether it is chilly or warm! All of us enjoyed the wide selection of foods, whether we ordered a la carte or chose the buffet. The had different choices of fresh juices on every occasion. While the food does take its time to show up, when my son decided he wanted more, they brought his second order very quickly. I take that as good service (or we got lucky because we were still eating breakfast at 11.30 am). The buffet selections were good on the weekday, but was a king's feast (or queen's, depending on your perspective) on Sunday brunch. They make doughnuts in front of you depending on your selections!  I would recommend a visit (or two).",

The three of us ordered the same thing- Grilled Cheese Sandwich with soup combo.  Presentation is nice, but the rest is pretty funny.... 1/2 a grilled cheese sandwich with the crusts cut off (I guess that is fancier?!) and the SMALLEST saucer of soup you have ever seen ..... you know those saucers they put your hot mustard sauce in at any Chinese restaurant?? ... well, that's what the soup comes in!!!!!!! seriously.  All this for $17.00.   The sandwich and soup were both good... like I said we wanted a light lunch and it was sure 'light'.   So the problem came when my friend took a piece of bread from the roll they gave us and found a very LONG hair baked into the bread. GROSS.  We called over the waitress and showed it to her. She apologized and took it away. It was clearly baked in the bread.  Unfortunately, the waitress seemed 'annoyed' at us... like it was our fault!!  She didn't take the rest of the loaf away.. she leaves it there like we are going to eat more from it!?  We had to ask her to get us a fresh loaf of bread... after that she wasn't very attentive for the rest of our meal. I guess we were the problem... so demanding.  At the end of our meal she brought out 2 mini cupcakes for us to share for 'our trouble'. TACKY.   Our bill was $83 (including tip) for 3 half grilled cheese sandwiches with tiny cups of soup, 3 beverages and 1 LONG piece of hair.   Oh, beverages are a rip too. $5 for coffee, ice tea or a diet coke which they serve out of the can at your table.......oh now that's fancy.",

We were in town in part for a John Mayer concert, and the music they were playing was, well, John Mayer.  If that's your kind of thing it was a nice soothing brunch soundtrack.  We read good things about the brunch buffet, so decided to give it a try.  Everything about Verandah was memorable... except the food.  The buffet selection wasn't special in Vegas terms.  The mini donut station was my favorite part.  We loved the room, ambiance, location, however the buffet just didn't do it for us.",

    "text": "This review is only on the afternoon tea.    This is, hands down, my personal favorite place to get afternoon tea.  Why?  First off, this place is located in the Four Seasons (self-explanatory).  Second, due to the location of the Four Seasons (it is at the end of the strip) it is a more secluded hotel, and this restaurant is at the corner of the hotel thus making it a nice quiet spot from all the hustling and bustling of Las Vegas.  And lastly, the service as well as all the other desserts and sandwiches are simply top notch.  For example, even though there is an actual reason you need to reserve a spot in advance as they only make enough for the people coming, the staff was nice enough to place an extra order of scones for us to take to go.  They even packed extra jam and devonshire cream after we inquired as to whether or not they sell their jam to the public (which they don't or at least not at this location).  Furthermore, they have a medium size list of teas available, which is more than enough for me as I tend to stick with black tea when I do afternoon teas.  As for the other desserts they got the usual salmon sandwich, vege sandwich, chocolate cake, et cetera...  And yes this place is kind of pricey but really you are in Vegas and in a Four Seasons hotel at that to boot.    Definitely my favorite place for afternoon tea.  I always try to at least go every time I go to Vegas but I think their afternoon tea is only on weekdays so call ahead and make your reservation before you go.",

It being 5pm on Thanksgiving, we thought we were out of luck, but had spotted the Thanksgiving menu at Verandah online, since we were staying at TheHotel.  They took our reservation for the same night and served an awesome Thanksgiving dinner.  The turkey was moist, mashed potatoes and stuffing great, 3 kinds of pie for dessert, and a quiet, less crowded atmosphere.  Considering everyone working at Verandah was working on Thanksgiving, they were exceptionally friendly and accommodating.  I don't know why we didn't just plan to go here for our Thanksgiving dinner in the first place, but it worked out nonetheless.  We went back for breakfast the next morning and were happy with the food, atmosphere, and service then too.  Our experience with Verandah was definitely a 5 star experience.",

As someone who has always bragged up the Four Seasons this was highly disappointing. I am usually one that always gives restaurants two tries before I give up on them, pretty sure I don't feel the need to return or recommend them.  After writing the manager and not receiving a response, they are obviously not worried about it. I can say the food was good, as it should be for $50 a person on a get it yourself brunch. I did have to pass on the scrambled eggs though they had the appearance of something from a motel 6 free buffet.  The fact that they couldn't refill a drink or clear dirty dishes is certainly beyond ridiculous. Thirty minutes to take care of the check was also on the ridiculous side. Honestly I've had better service at any other restaurant in Vegas and being a local that's quite a few. Sorry Four Seasons you've dropped a few notches in my book.",

The inside of the restaurant was fairly busy, but the patio was almost empty (February). Heaters made the patio very comfortable, and it was so nice and quiet, which is hard to find in Vegas. The service was fast and extremely friendly with good advice and knowledge of the foods and wines. I picked a wine to have by the glass, and when I was only semi pleased with it, the waiter was quick to recommend another and was spot on in his advice from my description of what I like. The food was so fresh and well prepared, it was almost startling. Even their iced tea is really good, and made with ice tea ice cubes to avoid dilution! Talk about detail!",

I also had a side of bacon each time I came, I wish I knew how to cook bacon like that, I seem to always burn mine to a crisp.  The memosa I had for brunch was very good, but the bloody mary was one of the best I have ever had (at the suggestion of my waiter).  My waiter, Leo, was awesome.  Top notch service in every regard and a big influence on my coming back.  The atmosphere was lovely, except for the second time where there was a table with two rather abnoxious children constantly making a scene.  But that is hardly the restaurant's fault.",

They give diners the option of standard tea service for $30 per person, or for $38, they add either a glass of champagne or a green tea martini. I had the martini and it was smooth. The tea service itself was top notch - our server was attentive and friendly without being intrusive. The scones were still warm out of the oven, so no complaints there! Everything - the sandwiches, desserts, etc. were delicious.",

    "text": "I have to say Verandah at The Four Seasons Hotel offers the best weekend breakfast/brunch in town. I personally think it's better than Bouchon and Mozen. It's $37 per person with buffet style and serves between 7am - 1pm. If weather is nice, I strongly recommend to have outdoor seating by pool. You can customize your own omelet with smoked salmon, chicken, ham, mushroom, spinach, tomato, bell pepper, Jalapeno, Swiss cheese, Cheddar cheese at omelet station. They also have a donut station, which you can customize your own donuts with different dipping sauces & toppings. It's fun to see how bakery chef prepares those mini donuts right in front of you. Everything I had today was pretty good. (Scones, mini banana pancakes, banana parfaits, caramelized peach with ricotta cheese, smoked salmon omelet, vegetable quiche, fresh squeezed watermelon & berry juicy, and even roasted coffee!!) Everyone from hostess, waitress to bus boy is really friendly providing Four Seasons quality services. One more thing I would like to mention is all pastries were not drown in tons of sugar compare to most of other places. They made me feel less guilty and healthier to enjoy their lovely Sunday brunch ^__^",

I didn't what to order in a sense, so I asked the waitress for her favorites.   I had a glass of Yellow label, he had a glass of Rosso. I never ever drink red, but his red wine was so smooth with a touch of fruity taste in the end. At first, it smelled to oaky for me, but as soon as i sipped it, it was delicious  Bruchetta - I liked the eggplant bruchetta more than the classic tomatoes   capresse - OOOH so good, one of my favorites! The mozzarella was light and it complimented the tomatoes very well   Carpaccio -  oh man, i really really enjoyed this dish. The chef is a genius for including arugulas into this dish! YUM  Entrees:   Lampchop : it was very dry :/ my least favorite.. it also came with lots of beans?  Linguine with pesto : it was delicious but very heavy!  Meatballs: it was okay..   Overall, i really enjoyed their appetizers more than their entrees.",

(As of November 2014: $39 for brunch, $46 with one mimosa, $52 with the bloody mary bar).  My first surprise was the mimosas are not bottomless, as they are at other Four Seasons.  If you choose the bloody mary bar option those are bottomless (I highly recommend this option, as the bloody mary bar out shined all the other stations).  There's a station with traditional breakfast items (eggs benedict, sausage, bacon, potatoes, bread pudding, pancakes, etc.).  Other stations include: breads and pastries, fruit and cheeses, and desserts.  Smoked salmon was the only seafood available and there were no carved meats, or other more impressive items that you might expect at this price point.  Customized mini donuts and omelets were available at the made-to-order stations, and our server brought freshly made waffles to our table.",

The room itself isn't too big, but it opens up to the private pool at the resort, making it the perfect setting for lunch.  Four Seasons is known for its legendary service and it really shows here.  They even have a machine which makes ice cubes out of a few of the drinks you order.  That way when the ice melts, it doesn't dilute your drink!  Try that at home and see how impressive you are to your guests ;)  The lunch is 5-star hands down.  I always get the rib sandwich, which is always cooked to a perfect temperature and just melts in your mouth.  At $18 it's not cheap, but in many ways you pay for the wonderful atmosphere.  I also had the mini Klondike-like pops which are presented really well.  My dinner here was nothing special and a lot more expensive than lunch.  I had a steak (which I notice isn't on the menu anymore) that wasn't bad, but did not meet my expectations compared to the lunch.  When I do come back I am anxious to try the brunch which I heard is the best in Vegas, or enjoy my rib sandwich at lunch!",

It feels like a Westin in this property (not a bad thing, just not what I've seen from other FS).  Buffet is worthwhile on weekends, but below average compared to other Four Seasons, if that's helpful.  All breakfast food, fruit and pastries.  No lunch options for \"brunch.\"   All we wanted was some water and a high-chair, but it was quite a chore for our waiter.  I wouldn't bring children here.  Again, I would be between 3 and 4 stars here because of the food and ambiance, but this is the Four Seasons.  You have to do better, and I think I'm being generous in my review.",

Their signature (veal?) meatballs are really good, super light in texture and lots of flavor.   The Bronzing was great, and cooked to perfection.

    "text": "Verandah at the Four Seasons is one of the few places I'll pay exorbitant mark-ups for breakfast / bruch food. Bouchon will always be my #1 in my heart, but Verandah has always been a favorite of mine for many years.  FOOD: The first time I ate at Verandah was back in 08' for Mother's Day. As a teenager, fine dining lunch was the only thing I could afford. Over the years, I've kissed goodbye the lobster eggs benedict at breakfast and the only salmon burger in Vegas I'll eat. The salmon was always flavorful and perfectly cooked. If I'm paying a mini-fortune for a burger, I expect it to be prepared the right way. The current menu offers all the classics which they do extremely well. The corned beef has--yummy! But as a fine dining restaurant, I would like to see a little more character and diversity--something unique to Verandah that will make me itch to come back to eat.  DINING: If the weather allows, DO sit outside. The patio area is absolutely amazing on a beautiful day. Its upscale and luxurious but you get the amazing view of the pool. They have big sunbrellas and adorable wicker chairs to lounge around and enjoy your meal--classy! There's also plenty of space between you and the next table so you don't need to worry about being cramped or eavesdropping. The interior is just as nice.   Whenever I come here, I get that relaxed, laidback vibe but I still feel fabulous. This place is perfect for having a nice meal with friends or someone you're trying to impress. If your into American food classics--you'll certainly enjoy this place.",

    "text": "Wow. This place really blew my mind. I came here at 8am Saturday for the weekend breakfast buffet. It is served til 1. Now previously if asked what best place to get breakfast on a Saturday was Id have said Wynn buffet duh! But this buffet is even better. To start off you actually have a server who checks in on you and you have the option for a la carte if you are with someone who doesn't eat much but you enjoy buffets. Like most buffets it includes coffee juice soda etc with alcohol for purchase. You get your own coffee pot but the server still came by and refilled it himself of he saw it was getting low. All of the food on the buffet is restaraunt quality not mass produced sometimes good sometimes meh. That being saod theres not as much variety as other buffets. Theres no carving ststion or dinner items. But a nice selection for breakfast. Some of my favorite offerings were the corned beef hash,  the hash browns, the chicken and waffles,  and the pumpkin pancakes. There are a ton of pastries to choose from as well and a made to order donut station which is a must try. There is everything from bagels to fruit to yogurt to eggs to cereal. There is a peanut butter machine that you grind your own peanut butter so it's nice and fresh and delicious. $44 after tac before tip but worth it... most buffets on a weekend for breakfast will cost a pretty penny anyway why not go to one where you get high quality.",

I came here with a few business friends for lunch...took the recommendation from the waiter and had the Seafood Insalate.    Lobster, crab, jumble shrimp, sliced boiled egg, tomatoes, greens.   Healthy, refreshing, Abundant.   I loved it except the price --$26.    Food in Vegas is insanely expensive these days.  For that price we get two entries in LA.    Wait staff is professional and friendly. Interior is stylish and beautiful.  I will probably come back to try their signature items.",

    "text": "The ultimate brunch mecca. Never in my wildest dreams could I have imagined the delicacies I would try at Veranduh.   I was determined to find a fabulous brunch spot in Vegas for a bachelorette weekend. Not wanting a diner-like place, I was ecstatic when I found Veranduh. I called well in advance and they had room for our party of 9. The day of, we arrived a few minutes early, so our table was not ready yet. We happily waited in the Four Seasons pool area.  We were then seated at a spectacular outdoor table. The menu offers a la carte items or a buffet style brunch for $37. Drinks were additional but the Unlimited Bloody Mary Bar sold me.   First things first, get to the Bloody Mary bar. It had all the fixins'. All types of hot sauces, olives, pickles, bacon, salts, etc. If you had at least 2 (which you will, because it is so delicious), the cost paid for itself.  Now on to the buffet. Holy moly. They have everything you could think of including:  Omelet Station Mini Huevos Rancheros (in mini cast iron skillets, I die) Eggs Benedict Lox Pancakes Waffles Pastries All types of breads (bagels, croissants, etc). Make your own donuts (well, someone makes them for you but you get to choose exactly how you want it!)  I would rather go here every day for brunch and not eat any other meal.   It is expensive, yet somehow reasonable considering you are in Vegas. The food and drinks are worth every penny. Service was top notch (I wouldn't expect anything less at the Four Seasons). Great for a group, also!  My only warning would be: pace yourself. Try everything but save room for the next dish.  I hope breakfast in heaven is at Verdanduh every day.",

We had breakfast there during our ray at the Four Seasons with the breakfast package. Normally we avoid buffets but this was outstanding. High points were the fresh doughnuts, breakfast flatbread, quiche, sweet roll, and my favorite, the bread pudding. They also let us order eggs benedict fresh from the kitchen. I recommend this highly for brunch.",

Everything was good, but the pecan sticky rolls were the best we've ever had.  Try the watermelon and lime juice, too -- it was very, very tasty.  Later the same day we returned for a late night dessert.  The eskimo popsicles were great (caramel ice cream coated in chocolate and nuts).  The chocolate souffle was also good.  Service was friendly and prompt.",

They serve breakfast, brunch, or lunch until relatively late, and they're one of the best high end places open in town for an upscale meal under $25.    I tried the salmon BLT.  Very solid dish.  The fish was exceptional and very filling.  The wait staff was a little slow, but given that the weather was great and we were sitting outside, I think they might have just been a little overwhelmed.  Overall a very relaxing, delicious meal.  I would recommend Veranda to anyone who doesn't mind spending $25 on a quality meal.  This isn't your normal steakhouse, but neither is a local diner.  Come here for a nice brunch in a secluded pool atmosphere.",

The food is always great, they let me substitute items on the menu, service is almost always good, and they have mini donuts. Also, their iced tea is the BEST and comes with iced tea ice cubes, so when they melt, they don't dilute the tea. And no packet sugar/sweetener here, replaced by simple syrup. Fancy!  I went there recently for dinner. I planned to meet a friend for lunch but she had to cancel at the last minute. I had been looking forward to it for days, so I was bummed and my kind hubby offered to take me there for dinner (one of the many reasons why I love him, lol).  Dinner was great! Ordered the fritto misto (calamari) to start. Fried perfectly and accompanied by a yummy marinara sauce. I had the branzino for my entree, which was delicious. It came with whipped potatoes but I substituted rice (see 2nd paragraph). A side order of truffle potatoes had just enough truffle flavor - many places claim to have truffle _____ but when you get it, you can't even taste the truffle. Not so here.  Mini ice cream bars for dessert wrapped up a fantastic meal. Note: my first choice was the chocolate souffle, but it takes 15 minutes to bake.",

    "text": "Starting at the parking lot you have extremely polite valet attendants and people opening the doors and welcoming you. Walk to your left and enter the Verandah. Do yourself a favor and ask for the outdoor seating. You can hear birds chirping, soft relaxing music, a peaceful waterfall, heat lamps, covered patio so no sun in your eyes. I instantly transported myself to the 4 Seasons in Maui which I fell in love with. Towards the end of our breakfast the pool was filling up. I think the earlier you get to the restaurant the better so you're not experiencing the pool crowd. Even then there were no screaming kids, still relaxing.  On to the food, its hard for me to decline a customized omelette bar. The ingredients were good but I think a homemade salsa would be much more appropriate for the high price tag we were paying. This was Pace picante salsa straight from the jar. Also a few more gourmet items such as sun dried tomatoes or goat cheese would have been nice. The highlight for me were the mushrooms and spinach which were cooked perfectly.  On to the hot items. Eggs Benedict was delicious, frittata, quiche, corned beef hash, scrambled eggs with salmon, scone with lemon curd, mascarpone cheese blintz with roasted apple glaze, vanilla bread pudding (couldn't try this because it was in a such a big bowl, wish they had a mini size), applewood smoked bacon, peppered bacon, guava pancakes, and more.   There were a bunch of pastries I did not touch. My husband got a pastry and it was rock hard. I'm thinking people don't waste their time on those pastries and it was old.   On to the next section- bagels, breads, smoke salmon, capers, tomatoes,  onions and do not miss the honey roasted peanut butter made fresh!!! I asked and there are no other ingredients. It's outstanding! I enjoyed the mini banana parfait with candied walnuts and homemade granola.   The juices included was fresh squeezed orange juice and fresh mixed berry juice (including watermelon, cantaloupe, and berries blended together). It was really yummy! They also offer coffee. The service was too notch. I never once had to ask for anything but it wasn't pushy and annoying. Drinks were filled and they walked away, I appreciated them not interrupting conversations. They were quick to take plates and asked if we needed anything but like I said it wasn't too much.   Don't be like me and stuff yourself and not leave room for the fresh donuts!! Don't miss out on the donuts. Now take a bite of bacon then a bite of a mini glazed donut and now yours in heaven!!!  For $7 more you can have a Bloody Mary from the bar. You make it yourself with lots of complimenting toppings and additions!! They also have an option of unlimited Bloody Marys!   I think I would have enjoyed this experience just as much with ordering off the menu. It's pretty expensive for breakfast but a nice treat that has some good quality items.",

The food is all great but nothing to die for.  It is pretty pricey at about 50 dollars a person.  I honestly feel like I can go to Dennys and then Pinkbox Donuts right after and get the same, if not better quality food.  They have a pretty good selection of food but nowhere near other buffets in Vegas that are easily half of the price for brunch.  In comparison, the Belagio brunch buffet is 25 dollars and has a MASSIVE selection of food to choose from.    Veranda brunch has a fresh donut bar, cereal, fried chicken and waffles, pancakes, eggs, omelettes, and a variety of pastries.    I still love this place for the ambience but food selection doesn't give you enough bang for your buck in my opinion.",

Restaurant, glasses and dishes were clean. Selection was good though most guests go with the prix-fixe menu that has a good selection of wine, aperitif, entree and desert. Presentation of the food was excellent. Every serving included a brief introduction to the dishes. Pricing was not off the scale considering the food and drinks it included on the strip in a four seasons.",

But to call this crappy brunch a buffet is an insult to buffets. A couple chafing dishes and a prepacked fruit bar does not deserve a $39 price tag. The food is dry but more so, it's just plain. I get the same thing Embassy Suite. Dried out eggs, left over sausage and then they step it up with hash browns in their own little skillets, oh cool. Then you take a bite and realize this has been sitting under heat lamps for the last hour. And who still charges for mimosas on brunch Sundays? Even the Hampton Inn had artificial crab meat for its omelette bar. I will give a second star for the service. The waiters/busmen (?) were  attentive and friendly. At least dress them cleaner, the baggy dockers just looks like the second shift at the factory. But the fact the this costs $129 PLUS tip for 2 people, 3 mimosas, for some dried out heat lamped canned good food is a shame. Never again!",

If you can get over to this resturant/buffett i suggest you do it. It is small buffet with inside or outside eating. You can go to another buffet anywhere in las vegas and you probably wont get half the quality of this one within the price range. Its quiet and very relaxed with very very prompt service which flows well. I had a little bit of everything and it was delicious they have a few choices that i havent heard of or seen before but other than that it was standard breakfast foods.  They also have fresh fruits and a mini donut station with fresh made donuts which is awesome. Everything is portioned so you arent wasting any food. I have to say they have the perfect bacon as being a picky bacon eater i was over in the bacon section quite a few times they have three different ones peppered,smoked, and applewood.  The cornedbeef hash is also a great choice just wish there was more in the little skillet. Egg white frittata was great also.",

Beautiful decor and great service take it over the top.  I ate there every day for breakfast, and once for lunch, even though I had a breakfast included at the hotel I was in.  Don't miss the Mezze Platter as an appetizer.  It is enough for 4!  I could have made a meal of this alone.  The Tuscan Chicken Salad is amazing as well.    Can't wait to return in August to sample happy hour before the Stevie Wonder concert...and breakfast the next day!",

    "text": "They say the devil is in the details and I'd expect a restaurant at The Four Seasons to have a handle on the details. Unfortunately, that ball was dropped. Hard.   The hostess was mildly unpleasant. The waiter was stand-offish and slow. And, considering the restaurant had more staff than customers at the time we visited, the service was surprisingly inattentive.   We came for happy hour because the happy hour menu was attractive and well priced (especially for Vegas and The Four Seasons). The Mozzarella Carrozza was delicious and I would have gladly ordered a second plate had I been pleased with the service (almost being impaled with silverware when the server *threw* them down on the table in front of us was a big miss).      The drinks were quite good as well. I enjoyed the Mai Thai, although it seems the bartender overfilled the drink; the glass was sticky. I'd expect that at a dive-bar, but not from The Four Seasons.   Overall, I was sorely disappointed with my visit to Veranda. Given the other reviews for this lounge, I'd hope my experience was the exception and not the rule. However, considering this establishment is representing one of the premier luxury hotels, I'd expect a higher level of service and a more polished experience. Perhaps my next visit will be better.",

The layout is nice - plenty of inside seating at tables and some booths.  There is also outdoor patio seating by the outside private pool at the Four Seasons which is much smaller than Mandalay but is also quiet and not crowded at all so it's very pleasant.    Breakfast here is VERY good with lots of options and very healthy fare - so I was pretty happy about that because usually there is only one healthy option and the rest is bad but it was a healthy mix of both.  I tried their healthy sampler which had some carrot/orange juice, a carrot blueberry whole wheat muffin, some quinoa muesli and some yogurt with berries.  It was DELICIOUS.  Best part was their fresh warm muffin - I adored it and ended up ordering it a few more times to have with my other breakfast choices.  My husband ordered their s'mores french toast and, while I usually dislike french toast, I ate some of his and loved it.    We got their weekend breakfast buffet one day and enjoyed it very much - at around $40 a person it's fairly pricey but everything at the Four Seasons is (or in Vegas for that matter) so we went ahead.  The buffet also had some healthy options (tons in fact) and the standard fare like eggs, waffles, etc.  I liked that they had scones with lemon cream, mini chicken and waffles, a fresh omelet bar, a fresh mini donut bar, and tons of fresh fruits and pastries.  Very nice buffet with options to please any palette.    We stopped in and had a nice lunch out on the patio one afternoon where I ordered their Salmon salad and enjoyed it very much - it was light and healthy with fresh ingredients.  My husband ordered a Bison burger I believe and I tasted it - also very good.   All in all - we very much enjoyed this restaurant and will likely eat here again when staying in Vegas for our next trip.",

    "text": "We had the brunch buffet on sunday am.  It was pricey at 39 a person but expected given the location in the Four Seasons.  It did not disappoint, we did a walk through to confirm it was worth the price.  The sheer volume and diversity combined with the attention to detail and preparation of each thing we tried was impressive.  This is not the usual mass produced brunch buffet.  Each station had individual servings of items like chilaquiles, hash, sticky buns, bread pudding. As well as all the usual fare for breakfast.  The omelet/scramble bar with the chef making what you ordered was impressive and the ingredients were all fresh.  The normal pastries and carb section had the interesting addition of a homemade hot doughnut bar.  Great quality and quantity for the price.  Would highly recommend if you don't mind spending the money and appreciate quality ingredients. If you just want some of the red, some of the yellow and some of the orange for your 10 dollar brunch, you better look elsewhere.",

Omelet station, toast/bagels, lox, hash browns, silver dollar pancakes, chicken apple sausage... All your breakfast favorites prepared uniquely! They always add new items to the menu- my favorite is the chicken and waffles! Your brunch comes with coffee and choice of juice.

They greeted me with a smile, ask for my name and then everyone that came by my table addressed me as Mr Uy, which I must confess is a bit weird for me.  I stopped by for breakfast and ordered the Egg White Frittata and was blown away. I ordered it w/o the pesto, because I just find pesto a bit over powering for me at times and I just wasnt ready to start my day with \"pesto breath\". Coffee was a tad strong but was bottomless and I also ordered a mimosa which I later regretted. It was nice, but it cost $14 compared to my meal that was only $16.  I forgot to add that I had my breakfast outside on the patio which is poolside. If the weather is cooperative, I really recommend you eat on the patio.  I had an amazing experience here and will definitely come back, hopefully with some friends next time!",

If you park in Mandalay Bay's lot you can easily walk there.  They do require 24 hours of advance notice, so book ahead.  They make some of the best scones I've ever had, and paired with one of their organic teas you can't go wrong.  The staff were extremely pleasant and accommodating...since I came at the end of tea time they even let me take some extra scones to go!

Tranquil with great service, excellent food I have always looked forward to my breakfasts here. However, this trip was different. Maybe it was how the Four Seasons screwed up my reservation and made us scramble to find a room the day BEFORE we were suppose to come (a story for another time) that tainted our breakfast. I don't know. The huevos rancheros were good, not great. The coffee was good, not great. It was just off. And to make matters worse, they took off the menu one of the best breakfast items on the strip, the corned beef and pastrami hash. No longer and I was so in the mood for it! Sigh. The track record speaks for itself so I will undoubtedly return again. But I will say that with the changes that have occurred at the Four Seasons recently (mostly behind scenes management stuff) I am not all that encouraged for the future.",

We had to skip the first course and where only offered 7$ discount. Moving on this restaurant also services the breakfast to the rooms at the four seasons. We stayed 2 nights and both nights out fruit plates where missing.  This Restaurant is absolutely not up to the expected four seasons standard.",

    "text": "LOVELY!  What a wonderful setting to enjoy a meal.    The Scene... contemporary... a tad intimate but not romantic... upscale restaurant to enjoy a meal.  It was a bit busy today (Sunday around noon) for brunch/lunch... and Everyone wanted to sit outside... so we opted (since we were hungry) to sit inside.  Really wanted to sit outside... but... next time.  The Brunch... if you opt for the Buffet... it's $35 and includes tea, coffee and juice... we were not that hungry... so we ordered off the a la carte menu.  The buffet is lovely but not Huge and Overwhelming like other hotel buffets.  In fact, from the aromas and the entrees I saw... it looked very appealing and the omelet station was very nice where you can have custom omelets/eggs...  And the Bread / Pastry area made my mouth water... which is why I opted NOT to eat the Buffet... it would have been easy to go Hog Wild with all the good looking eats.  Ordered the Eggs Benedict.... which is served on a round Polenta Cake... I say \"Cake\" because the Polenta was more cake like... sweet and creamy at the same time... (it took the place of the typical starch of the English Muffin)... it came with a nice poached egg and candian bacon on top... you get 2 servings... along with a side of steamed asparagus.  My mother ordered the Mini Waffles... and while Mini... they were big on taste and very artfully presented.  She got 3... one with berries, one with dried cranberries and one with cinnamon butter.    Our friend ordered the egg white frittata which came with a side of toaste which came in a basket.  For a Beverage... I ordered a Bloody Mary.... it's Darn good.... not as good as the one at THE cafe at THE hotel... but definitley Solid.  Mom had a Mimosa... she said it was ok.  The check for the 3 of us... with our 2 alcoholic beverages and 1 coffee was $92 before tip.... this is a bit pricey... but 1) it's the Four Seasons and 2) it's Vegas.  Note... if you order coffee... it's $5.50... personally I think that's a rip off but what do I know.",

The omelet was good, nothing special, but I thought the hashbrowns were really good. They were light and crispy on the outside. Hubby tried a bite and got his own side order of hashbrowns. A solid place to get breakfast. They also have an \"express buffet\" on the weekdays which is a scaled down version of their regular buffet.",

If you like a very nice, low key atmosphere, a reasonable buffet with fresh ingredients and a very competent, friendly staff, go to Verandah for brunch or lunch.

Their brunch buffet is tiny - think your standard nice hotel breakfast buffet in any other city. The quality is great, but in my mind not great enough to make up for the lack of options. The donuts are fab (I served these at my wedding!) and the other highlight for me was the beautiful cups of fresh fruit. They were tiny, but it's a buffet - so sue me if I can eat 4 baby cups of berries :)   I've also been for breakfast (a la carte) and dinner. The setting is beautiful by the pool, but the service is hit or miss. Great martinis, great food in general but nothing \"special\". The food here is hardly inventive, gourmet, or interesting but it's solid - and that should count for something !   In summary, I prefer the breakfast a la carte to the tiny buffet. The dinner here is great - far better than Charlie Palmer next door.",

When I ordered breakfast I wasn't even sure if I would get what I ordered because he was paying attention to everything BUT what I was asking him. For what I'm paying I at least expect a breakfast that reflects that and to be honest I have had better. The eggs benedict was very disappointing.I would not recommend or give it a second chance because alike most people I love a good eggs benedict and believe the appropriate response to \"thank you\" is not \"mm hmm\" or \"yup\".",

We waited forever for our waiter, and then waited forever for our drinks, then waited forever for our food. I actually don't mind waiting awhile for food, because I like to savor my cocktail beforehand, but our waiter was pretty inattentive with that, I had to flag him down or remind him to bring us our drinks.  My hubby ordered bruschetta, soup, and a caesar salad- all very mediocre. They completely forgot to bring him a soup spoon until I got up and asked for one. He ordered the arrabiata pasta (said it was ok, nothing special). I ordered the chef's specialty \"Pasta in a jar', which sounded promising. It arrived around dusk, so I couldn't see the color of the shrimp and seafood so well, but I noticed it felt slimy and squishy in my mouth. I checked it out and the shrimp had a little pink but was mostly grey!! I don't know why I didn't just send it back but instead ate the pasta peices around the undercooked fish instead. It was truly, truly DISGUSTING!! I am hoping I don't get food poisoning from it, but I am sure it is probably flown in fresh daily, so at least there's that.  Also, I was expecting amazing ambiance, but it was basically like a glorified Tommy Bahama's minus the live music, situated around a swimming pool. Wish we would've gone somewhere else, what a waste of a date night!!",

    "text": "After reading previous reviews I was rather disappointed in the overall experience for brunch.  The food quality was good but not exceptional - the \"brunch\"  was more of a European style breakfast with cheeses and cured meats.  Service also lacked the polish and professionalism that Four Seasons is noted for.   The server had to be asked more than once for beverages.  It is a beautiful setting but is definitely lacking from previous visits in years past.",

    "text": "The feeling overall is nice. I like how you can get \"fancy\" food, minus the stuffy atmosphere. You can definitely tell this place is most frequented by the guests of the hotel because they walk in wearing casual clothing and there were tons of families with young children.  I also thought the service was excellent: 5 stars. So why did I give this place 3 stars? Frankly, the food is not worth what they charge. And their cocktails leave something to be desired.  The braised short ribs were probably my favorite dish of the night. The blue nose snapper had a nice crisp sear to it, but it was pretty bland.  For dessert, we had a milk chocolate and candied orange velvet cake. I had some reservations because I don't enjoy strong orange flavored sweets, but it was surprisingly delicious. I liked how it reminded me of a Ferrero Rocher with a subtle orange flavor.  I'd like to come back and try the afternoon tea. But for fine dining, I'd rather go elsewhere.",

    "text": "****Brunch Review******   There's a reason why Verandah is located in the lobby of the 4 Seasons - your experience (food, service, ambiance) will be fantastic. And, that, it was for us. For starters, my man wanted lunch-type stuff, and I wanted breakfast, so the servers brought us both menus and said it would be no problem to serve either. Ah... I could get used to this...   Star 1 - The Huevos Rancheros. Perfect combo of eggs, cheese, beans, and spices. Also, the fantastic servers (see Star 5 below) were able to whip up a spicier blend of the house salsa that is served as a side. After eating at a resto which prides itself on Mexi food (see my review of Hussong's) on the same weekend, I was pleasantly surprised at the authentic quality of this dish.   Star 2 - the gluten free lemon pancakes. Yum and yum. You could taste the hint of lemon in each bite, but it was not too overpowering. Perfection.   Star 3 - the mahi mahi soft tacos. Again, perfect fish-to-everything else ratio so that you could actually taste all of the ingredients and marvel at how well they worked together. Also, a special shout out to the accompanying guac.   Star 4 - Beverages - First, let's start with the Latte, which I asked be served with a shot of hazelnut. This latte might just be the best I've had in Vegas. No sugar-additives needed, and it tasted very creamy, even though they substituted the real milk for almond milk. And (drum rolls please) -- their iced tea. With the iced tea ice cubes (so that the tea doesn't taste watered down), and the liquid sugar pour (so that each sip of tea tastes like the last one since the liquid sugar dissolves more quickly), it is deliciousness in a glass.   Star 5 - Leo and Lucio - our servers. I should probably have broken them out into separate stars but I'm running out of stars here!! No request big or small was too much for them. The fact that we had 2 servers for 2 diners should alone tell you how far they will go to make sure you have a great meal. These two gents only helped make this meal that much more fantastic.   Lest you think we are a couple of barbarians, we did have a special situation which allowed us to sample many dishes at the same time. No, we did not eat everything we ordered at one seating.... that said, these were some of the best leftovers ever!",

    "text": "I came here after 5 hours at Spa Mandalay. The spa only had a basket of bananas and apples, some juice and water, and I hadn't eaten breakfast. Needless to say, I was flippin starving, and when I'm that hungry, I never know what I want because nothing sounds good enough. So I decided that after my spa treatment, to treat myself further by visiting the very near and very posh Four Seasons Hotel. I stopped by the concierge desk at the Mandalay Bay (where I was staying) and asked if there was anything she could recommend me at the Four Seasons and she directed me to Verandah.  Let me just say, that this was the best solitary lunch I've ever had. It was a beautiful, crisp, January afternoon and I chose to sit outside and have lunch with my Cavalli sunglasses on. Having no reservations, I requested a table for 1, but before I was even taken to my table, I was offered a newspaper for reading. I opted for my British Elle magazine instead.  I ordered a sparkling water with lime, and it came out with a varietal bread basket along with some pure olive oil the waiter walks around with in a fancy little pourer. Personally, I think the bread basket is an indicator of how nice a restaurant is, and this was no exception. Wanting to present myself as a posh customer, I forwent most of it, and proceeded to order the Italian Wedge Salad. I love wedge salads, it sets the scene for a high-end power lunch. For my main lunch course, I went with one of the restaurant's signature dish, the \"Christina\" Panini that had pesto chicken, onion jam, basil mayo, tomatoes, and provolone, with a small side broccoli salad. Service was expectedly impeccable, because they brought out the check almost immediately after I mentioned I had an appointment in half an hour (an appointment with the Lion King matinee showing!).  I sat there for an hour reading my magazine, enjoying the sun and solitude, noshing on $30 worth of wedge salad and chicken panini and it was fabulous. Definitely keeping this place my own secret Vegas hiding place, and coming back for their afternoon tea which you have to reserve a day in advance and is only available on the weekdays.  After a long night of drinking and gambling, an early spa treatment is in order, and after, a quiet lunch at the Verandah followed by an early matinee show of the Lion King really puts you back in the mood to hit the town again!",

I really enjoyed the scones with lemon curd, the lox, and the chicken sausage. My favorite was the donut bar particularly the one with the crunchy topping. It was delicious!  I thought the pumpkin pancakes were ok. The carrot juice was VERY delicious!  In regards to service... When I asked for a straw, the waiter told me to use my daughter's used straw that was all bitten up! Seriously?!   I definitely won't be coming back. I honestly would not be complaining if the service is great.",

And our first morning breakfast was here, at Verandah. We stayed at Mandalay Bay and it was just a short walk to the this place at Four Seasons Hotel that is on the same territory as Mandalay Bay.   It was a chilly morning and the place was packed inside so were offered to sit at the table outside with a floor heater lamp moved next to us. But you know what? Make sure to sit OUTSIDE as if you sit inside it just feels as a typical restaurant.  Service was fantastic: timely and friendly. Place was very clean with people reading newspapers, sipping on orange juices and coffees. If you sit outside, you feel like you are somewhere in Hawaii (palm trees, swimming pool is seen from the terrace).  Prices are reasonable for this level of a restaurant. You can probably spend up to $30/person on a full breakfast. Keep in mind, they have a buffet type of breakfast as well at $35. If you are a small eater, probably you can order off the menu (oatmeal and tea) and it will be less.   The buffet setting feels very elegant as well. Food looks and smells good; is very fresh and tastes delicious.  The selection is not as huge as in some buffets out there, but it has the staples (scrambled eggs, French toasts, oatmeal, berries, fruit, yogurt, some meat (sausage chicken and pork, bacon), which makes it easy for you to make a selection and not to overeat but still indulge on your favorites.  Want to feel like a royal? Go here on any occasion. It's worth it... but like I said above, make sure to sit outside!  Bon Appetite, Ulyana",

Their signature eggs Benedict is served on polenta cake instead of an English muffin.  My mom asked if she could have it served traditionally and the server said, yes, totally, we do it all the time.    When our order arrived, the Benedict had the polenta cake.  I also ordered a side of fruit that I didn't get initially either.  It seemed anything that was out of the ordinary was simply ignored.    I was done eating my ricotta pancakes (super yummy) before my mom's meal arrived following the polenta debacle.    I'm going to have to give this one a second chance but for now I'm giving Verandah 3 stars.",

    "text": "Visited the Verandah on Memorial Day Monday with three other friends using, of course, the ubiquitous TravelZoo coupon.  Five course meal for a smashing price.  Arrived with my pal about 20 minutes pre-reservation to have a drink.  Missed Happy Hour pricing by mere minutes (looks like they offer some really good deals).  Sat at a table about 7 feet from bar.  Not crowded.  We were ignored for almost 15 minutes.  There went any desire to get that bottle of prosecco.  BTW - we were dressed  very nicely and were in PLAIN SIGHT of bartenders and servers.  Not a great start.  Friends joined us - seated on the verandah.  Lovely setting, perfect temp, etc.  Meal was one glass each of sparkling wine and then the five courses.    Overall it was a very nice meal with great friends.  Pros: Setting was relaxing and peaceful Food was nicely presented and short ribs were melt in your mouth delicious as was gouda fonduta.  I wanted to grab my friends' plates and eat theirs Bill was crazy low - nice change from everything else in Vegas  Cons: Indifferent service all around - from oblivious bartending staff to our server(s). Server was not rude or incompetent - just not at level I expected from this venue. Food was quite salty and as I love me some sodium - I was fine but we all joked about how puffy and bloated we expected to be the next day.  And we were. One friend had an allergy that she advised server about from the start - they managed to work around it on one item that didn't even mention it as an ingredient but then for dessert - where it was listed - they delivered 4 of same and we had no clue if one of them had been doctored for her.  And no server to ask for clarification.  Not sure if I would go back.  Not a horrible experience but not so outstanding that I can't miss a chance to return.",
