I started out with the peppers, spicy cucumbers, brussel sprouts and cauliflower... all we're tasty and I never liked brussel sprouts. Next was the tri tip (for myself) and salmon(wifey). Both were A-MAYY-ZING. I highly recommend the tri-tip, I was cutting it with a butter knife... so tasty. I am not a top food critic but I do love food and wine. I enjoy the art and science of it all. So when I tried the Pinot Noir recommended with the dish, it made my taste buds dance. Then dessert!!! Awwhh... I was a happy camper. Did I mention a contestant from \"Chopped\" works there? I love that show which made the night extra special. I even got an autograph buttttt left it in my hotel on the nightstand. Kicking myself for that ... anywho. Try this place out. I will be returning during my next visit. Shout out to Victor, Mags, the sommelier guy, and every one else who made my birthday memorable.  Thanks again.",

    "text": "So I was mentally prepared to love Momofuku - I have read cookbook which is as much a history of the development of the concept and have never been able to get into their NYC restaurant - so happy to see they opened in Vegas and more than excited to finally try it out and it was very good but there were some service flaws that affected the whole meal.  This was a business dinner and you should know the place if loud - music cranked up so everyone talks louder and you can't really hear the person across the table - we were at a round table and the conversation could only be with the two parties to either side - I know it is Vegas - just understand that is the gig.  Arrive on time and our table wasn't ready - not a big deal the whole party wasn't there but it took close to a half hour for the table and once it was ready the hostess said clear the bar tab and come find her - not sure that's the way it should work - happy to clear the tab but how about you take the rest of the group to the table.  The bar has a fairly limited beer menu - not shocking but a large selection of specialty drinks - more on that later.  As far as the venue goes - Momofuku is a beautiful restaurant, touch dark but urban/modern decor great graffiti-ish wall mural - made us feel a little under dressed. Well after 9:00 when we sat for our 8:30 reservation and then we had to wait a bit - five minutes or so for our waitress to show - it seems we also had someone helping with drinks but he came and discussed gin - got one drink - failed to get another and we never saw him again.  Our main waitress was nice and knowledge about the menu and was helpful with recommendations - in fact we basically went with what she suggested.  So have gone half a page and not mention food - so lets start for real - Momofuku is meant to be family style dining with a large lazy susan in the middle of the table to rotate selections around the group - cool.  Started with the Spicy Cucumbers and Shishito Peppers - both were good but would lean to the cucumber, large hunks vs slices lightly dusted in togarashi and (olive?) oil with almonds it was light but quite good.  The peppers were fine with a bit of a smokey taste but nothing you haven't had before.  So our waitress said go with the duck and we did - it says serves 3-4 - we have five and it was plenty but we did get a couple smaller entrees as well.  What was not explained is exactly how to consume the Rotisserie Duck - turns out you use the lettuce wraps and chive pancakes with toppings/sauce - understand that that is seems obvious now but never having ordered it everyone was a bit confused - bottom line is the Duck is amazing - brought to the table and carved into perfect 1/4\" inch slices then laid out over a huge bowl of sticky rice - the skin seared to crispiness and the duck meat so juicy you didn't really need and of the accompanied sauces - I would be hard pressed to not order it again.  Bonus went the duck was gone I used the ssam sauce and ginger scallion sauce over the rice.  Other highlights were the Grilled Lamb Ribs - just a touch of yogurt sauce was all the needed - they let the lamb be the star of the show - this one said it feeds two but we all had a rib and were happy.  Also tried the Chilled Spicy Noodles with sichuan sausage, thai basil and candied cashew - another must order - the mostly green dish had a subtle heat but was mostly refreshing - great paring with the heavier duck and lamb.  One quick note again on the service side - I ordered their specialty Old Fashion when the food was ordered - didn't receive it until we were well into the main course - worse it was fantastic - more of a Manhattan with rich bourbon and only the tiniest hint of sweetness and I would have had two if I had started earlier.  Two sides for the table were the Brussels Sprouts & Cauliflower - crisp and delicious and Asparagus - which were just okay, maybe the only thing we had that I wouldn't order again.  Could leave without trying something from Milk Bar and again listened to our waitress and got the Crack Pie with Cereal Milk Ice Cream - the pie is so dense it is a thick caramel delight and pares with not as sweet as you expect ice cream - shared among five it was a great finish to the meal.  Summary - food was outstanding and assuming some service glitches get resolved it will be up on the top end of the Vegas restaurant scene.",

My friend and I shared one pork belly bun and the shoyu pork ramen. The thick pork belly was so juicy and tender. The bun was great on its own but the ssam sauce elevated it. It added a nice sweet and spicy kick to it. We both enjoyed the ramen since we were craving some soup after a night out in Vegas. Once again the pork belly tasted amazing. The ramen broth tasted a bit plain to us, so we had to ask for more spicy seasoning. It was very simple and tasted great, but nothing too memorable so it felt overpriced. I would come back if I had a big group of friends with me to try their family dishes. I will try the fried chicken with caviar some day! Overall an ok restaurant to enjoy a pricey meal if you want to indulge in some Asian dishes.",

I would eat like 10 of these, if the price didn't hurt.  Uni Hashbrown - I thought this was a bit salty for me, but my friend enjoyed it.  Our two favorite things to eat in one place.  Uni and hashbrowns, who would of thought this amazing combo.  Chilled Spicy Noodles - The thai basil with the noodles + thai chilies + sausage + candied cashews were surprisingly so good together.  I don't like nuts in my food, but I didn't mind the cashews in this dish.  I would definitely order this noodle dish again.",

Water isn't complimentary, but it's only a dollar per person. It's some fancy bottled water that I was convinced was the best tasting water I had ever had, but it was likely placebo.  Back to the best ramen I've ever had, hands down. The pork belly literally melts in your mouth. Pig has never tasted so good. It comes w/ a pretty sizable dollop of pork shoulder to satisfy your meat needs. The noodles were perfectly firm and the broth was delicious.  I'm really not even that big of a ramen guy, but I'm gonna try to hit this place up every time I'm in town. You've made a fan out of me, Momofuku!",

It had just opened and was fairly new so it was super clean, modern and beautiful.  Then again what restaurant in Vegas is not?  The line was crazy so I decided to just sit at the bar.  Started out with the oysters from the raw bar and Shishito Peppers.  They were so delicious and the smoked salt on them is delicious!  For the main dish I had the Sizzling A5 Hokkaido Wagyu and it was darn delicious!!  I was trying to scoop the sauce that was remaining up to eat.  Such a  great experience sitting at the bar as we were able to interact with the staff and see the whole restaurant fill up.  Cannot wait to come back!",

    "text": "So far I've been to this Momofuku location twice (once for a midday bar-seating snack, and again for a Mother's Day lunch), and while I admit that I won't go out of my way to come here unless I'm either craving it or already in the area (it's a long drive for me to get here), it has not yet failed to deliver and satisfy. The atmosphere is very casual but upscale, with a really stunning full wall mural/graffiti that made me feel as close to 'hipster' as I'll ever be. The wait staff were attentive and helpful, as our family struggled to narrow down our choices. They made some excellent recommendations for our meal!   My first ever item here was the Pork Belly Buns, which literally melt in your mouth. The buns were fresh and perfectly steamed, and the pork was well-seasoned with the perfect amount of tenderness. The Pork Ramen was definitely just as good - pork had the same qualities, and the noodles were the perfect thickness/chewiness: hearty, filling... I struggle for the right descriptor, but those that have been to Japan and eaten authentic ramen know that there is a 'thickness' to the noodles that I can't fully articulate. Regardless, David Chang and Momofuku nailed it on the ramen here. We also had the Crispy Potatoes on the wait staff's recommendation, and I was so glad we tried this because it's my new favorite: as described, they are crispy, but the accouterments, seasonings, and sauces MADE this. The Rotisserie Jidori Chicken - we ate it to the bone, so yes, it was delicious. The dry seasonings worried me because it made it look so dry, but it was absolutely moist and tender  on the inside. Plus, you can't go wrong with added lime.  Everything was memorable about my meals here, and I absolutely intend to go back for more!",

The milk bar just outside the restaurant caught our eye first and we had to try their latest adult milkshake offerings. I got the fancy chocolate shake while my wife got the \"Golden Knight,\" named after the famous Vegas hockey team. With our orders getting made, the hostess at the restaurant was able to seat us right away and very graciously offered to bring us our drinks once they were ready. Didn't have to but I tipped her generously for her efforts. As expected, the drinks were amazing and we shared them together.  For dinner, we weren't starving so we shared a couple of small dishes. They do tapas style food. We shared the short rib kimchee stew which was delicious. They brought out 2 empty bowls and Asian soup spoons without us asking. The meat just melted in your mouth and the broth was just the right level of slickness and rich flavor without being overwhelming.  We highly recommend it. We also had to share the A5 Hokkaido Wagyu potatoes from their list of small dishes. Couldn't even finish it but loved the very thinly sliced wagyu beef and crunchy garlic covered small potato pieces. Very rich and delectable. Overall, staff and service were attentive and wonderful. Fun to people watch. Want to try their inside bar next time. Want to check out their seemingly generous whisky/whiskey selection. Decor reminded us of their New York bar with the usual Vegas charm. Definitely recommended to want to add some of the latest Asian fusion concoctions to your Vegas holiday and food adventure!",

    "text": "Wow Momofuku...I know there is so much hype and I know I should have expected to absolutely be satisfied but I was not expecting to fall aggressively head over heels in love with your food. This was my very first encounter with anything Dave Chang has touched and to be quite frank, long overdue.   This is just about as good as it gets and rating my experience with TL;DR notes would really be a total injustice. Keep reading for my Momofuku Love Diary Entry #1 :)  It was my last night in Vegas after a long winded trip with friends and so much vodka. Everyone already flew out earlier in the day so I really had the perfect opportunity to choose one spot I truly wanted to go to and have a solo self care date with me, myself and I. Of course Momo came to mind but I thought, well maybe it would be a basic and way too predictable choice. I wandered around the Miracle Mile completely buzzed and time window getting smaller to eat at world-renowned establishment. Instinctively, I hopped on OpenTable to see what was available. Beautifully enough there was one last seat for 10:30PM. I was about a 5 minute walk away and the time was 10:20PM. Pretty perfect act of fate.  I was seated at the kitchen bar to my shock, this place was calm and not overwhelming. My server donned a canvas apron that really made me feel connected to the chefs already. He gave me suggestions but was not too pushy. His enthusiasm for the food was very apparent and completely genuine. I started off with a singular pork belly bun and Hawaiian kampachi. The first bite of that bao is what I would imagine finding your soulmate feels like. It was the single most favorite bite of food I have ever had in my entire life. Maybe that is cliche, but that is the only way to describe it. The pork belly was thick and juicy fat seared to the perfect caramel color. A little crunch from the lightly pickled veggies paired with the airy cloud of bun was orgasmic in every single way. It shook every one of my senses and I'm drooling just writing this now. Kampachi was fresh and buttery. enough said. I ordered one more pork belly bun because I could not resist.   I got the A5 Wagyu next served over these garlicy bed of roasted golden potatoes. They were great but the stand alone absolute star of this dish was the thinly sliced beef that was marbled like heaven's butter. I can't even describe the those bites tasted. Words fail to encompass that sensation. Simple, subtle and so sophisticated. It was literally a symphony in my mouth ugh.   The last sweet little surprise of my night was a fellow solo diner sitting a few spots down from me. He had a big bowl of something that i was too eager to find out about. He told me it was a truffle ramen - not on the menu. Being an absolute truffle whore, I was so jealous I didn't get that. He was so sweet and actually gave me a bowl of his meal. If I could describe UMAMI as a dish, it would be that. The broth was rich and complex but not in a way that makes you regret it. I'm rendered a little speechless by my experience. It was a moment in time I will truly never forget. It has taught me to appreciate the simple things and small details.   Dave Chang, I am absolutely a fan. Thank you for sharing your soul with the World.   (Please see photos)",

It was so yummy, the egg was like an onsen egg and the pork belly was a thick slice with marbled fat throughout. My favorite part of the dish was the pickled shiitake mushrooms, I've never had that before and it was so refreshing and cut the fat of the pork really nicely. Our server was the best and honestly the nicest server I've ever had. 5 stars alone for the lovely interactions we had with him!",

    "text": "I have been waiting in anticipation for a very long time to try David Chang's Momofuku restaurant and when I realized there was one in Vegas, I knew I'd have to give it a shot!  The pork bun is every bit as good as promised. The bun is warmed, soft, fluffy and not overwhelming in texture or flavor. The PORK BELLY melts in your freaking mouth. It's perfectly cooked, perfectly seasoned, and just perfect in every way. I wasn't crazy about the sauce it came with. They give you a little bottle in case you want extra. It's kind of like hoisin sauce, but a little thinner and a little sweeter, but in my opinion, you definitely don't need extra. This was SO GOOD.  As for the ramen, it was definitely to 10 ramens I've ever had. The broth was rich and delicious, they give you tons of noodles, and it comes with TWO types of pork. One is a slice of the aforementioned perfection that is the pork belly. They also serve shredded pork shoulder. Honestly, it was a little rich for me, but so good. The bowl isn't that big, so you wouldn't think it was going to be so filling, but I honestly wanted to roll back to my hotel after this bowl of ramen.  My husband got extra mushrooms in his ramen and those were a tasty addition. You can add extra egg or other little things to your ramen, but just get the basics.   Weirdly enough, I think my favorite part about this place was the cider I got, which is from England. It cut the richness of the food just enough, cut the saltiness with the sweetness, and it came with a chilled glass.   The staff were all lovely people as well.  Fun fact: the bathroom has a bidet. lol.",

We arrived right before dinner rush so we were seated right away and greeted by our server. First impression our server loved being there and it made us love being there too! He was all about the menu and pretty knowledgeable on what was what when suggesting items.   Decor..loved the abstract drawings of the dogs. Our server told us the dogs are actually the owners. That was even more interesting because it made the place seem more personal, hard to do especially since they are located inside the cosmopolitan.   So we started with some appetizers - shishito peppers: can't go wrong with these - crab deviled eggs: have a strong smokey flavor - big eye tuna: OMG one of the best dishes ever! - oysters: small and flavorful my fav  Buns - pork belly: Delicious & the best amongst the buns - shrimp : its breaded, not amongst my favorites  - shitake: very different and glad I tried it  Chilled spicy noodles: spicy so careful. Filled with flavor and surprisingly very good.  Enjoyed a bottle of the Kintaki sake. Highly recommend this! It was so smooth and the taste was so clean.  Overall it was an experience im glad I had. I did feel it was a bit pricey for what it is, noodles and buns, what they are known for.",

We came around 9, which started great because we didn't have to wait too long to be seated. Our waiter was nice, he was pleasant and gave us our space to enjoy our food. We ordered the ramen and pork buns. The ramen was a decent size, the broth was quite delicious. The broth was subtle with great flavor. The pork was fatty which might have been a bit too fatty because it tasted a bit greasier than i do like. The noodles were just right, although for some reason the bowl itself smelled as though they had burned the noodles. It's the best way to describe which was a bummer because the burning of food smell is always pretty overpowering.   The pork buns were just okay. Again, the pork was a bit more fatty than my liking but overall the presentation was good. I would say they aren't life changing, so it would really be a choice to try. I do not know that I would be interested in trying anything else in the future, especially with so many restaurants in LV.",

    "text": "Sorry, but this place is overhyped.  Since my friends and I were staying at the Cosmo, we thought it'd be nice to eat at Momofuku as our first meal. Our expectations were pretty high, but we ended up leaving super disappointed.   We ordered the pork buns and the pork ramen all around. The pork buns came out first and it was actually pretty good! It was flavorful and the pork was very tender. 2 pork ramen bowls came out and we ordered 5 ramen bowls in total so we waited patiently for the other bowls to come out. We realized that the 3 other bowls were taking awhile so we told our 2 friends to start eating before us. We reminded the servers a couple of times that there were 3 more ramen bowls for the table. We started getting really annoyed because we noticed that tables who ordered after us received their ramen before us. At some point, our server informed us that they accidentally gave away our ramen to a different table lol.. By this point, our 2 friends were basically done with their ramen. I really don't understand why all 5 ramen bowls couldn't come out at the same time.   By the time we received the rest of our orders, we ate our ramen and we felt like the broth was pretty bland. The pork belly was okay but the shredded pork was just so random. It just felt out of the place within the ramen and that also tasted bland as well. Our 2 friends who ate before us tried our broth and realized that our broth tasted different from theirs. I tried their broth and I was shocked that theirs was even MORE bland than mine. It literally tasted like it was watered down. When my friend informed the server, all she replied was, \"..Well they came from the same pot, did you want them to make you a new one or something?\" My friend declined but we were slightly shocked cause we felt like she thought we were lying, but both batches really did taste different.   I love ramen but this by far was probably the worst ramen I've ever had. Along with horrible ramen, the service wasn't all that great either which made our experience with Momofuku at best only a 2 star rating.",

They have a little bit of ramen, some noodles, entrees, and even deserts. Instead of one linear focus, the menu here is quite large with a ton of variety!  My wife and I both ordered the pork ramen. 18 dollars and an additional 1 dollar for a small side of chili paste. That price is insane! It was the most expensive bowl of ramen I have ever enjoyed.  Price aside, the ramen was authentic with a very nice broth base and good quality pork.  The question I left with was this... Was the ramen 19 dollars good? Certainly not.  4 stars for the ramen and service, 2 stars for the price.",

I definitely regret not getting one of their buns (which they are known for) but it was hard to justify $7 for 1 bun. Instead we started with the shishito peppers which were great and the portion was generous. I got the pork ramen and added shiitake mushrooms and chili oil. Definitely get the chili oil! It adds a nice kick. My boyfriend got the rice bowl which was like a Japanese version of bibimbap. Both were really good! The reason for the 4 stars rather than 5 is that I've had better ramen for cheaper. With all the hype around this place I think my expectations were inflated. Still a very great dining option and it's in the beautiful Cosmopolitan.",

As you would have expected, I was so excited to finally visit one on my most recent visit to Las Vegas. Now that I have tried it, I felt more like..\"ok...been there, done that\"...and not like...\"yea! I gotta go there again.\" The experience felt definitely under my expectations..especially when looking at it from the food vs price perspective.  I felt pretty much almost every dish was overpriced. I definitely regretted ordering the soft boiled eggs with salmon roes ($9)...which essentially were literally 2 eggs with salmon roes and light sprinkle of rice crispy and a leaf or two of sprouts on it. Taste wise..not wasn't anything memorable. The buns (chicken karaage and pork belly) that we tried though were quite good..they were really small though...and while I get that the pork belly buns were one of the highlights...charging $6-$7 each is a little ridiculous...I guess it's a result of being in Las Vegas and a signature dish a brand name chef. We also tried the pork belly ramen..and while I get that it's David Chang's interpretation of ramen (made with mushroom based broth?) which differed from traditional ramen, the taste was ok..just wasn't anything memorable...esp given a just ok portion and a price point of $18.  Overall, I think I'm glad I tried it...but I will probably not go there again next time unless someone else in my group wanted to try it. Given the high price point and just ok..not so much memorable taste..and the fact that Las Vegas offers so many great dining options...I would probably choose to go elsewhere next time instead.",

We also tried the pork ramen and lamb ribs which were good but what really surprised us was the Honjozo Akitabare sake made by Momofuku which was light and refreshing. I went during lunch so I had an abbreviated menu but I will definitely be back for dinner to experience the menu in its entirety!",

    "text": "I'm caught in the middle of giving this place 3 or 4 stars but really I feel like the restaurant deserves 3.5. Located in Cosmopolitan on the 2nd floor, prepare for a long walk.   Made reservations ahead of time for a party of 4 and got the Fried Chicken & Caviar, the menu says serves up to 4-6 people but I can imagine it serving even 8. If you do decide to try this make sure you call ahead of time and let them know so they can prepare the order in advance.   The Fried Chicken & Caviar included two chickens that are fried whole, carved, then paired with a choice of Momofuku Reserve caviar, we chose the 8oz Smoked Trout Roe ($328) ... They provide you crepes that you use as a tortilla and truffle creme fraiche to top off. This dish was very intriguing but after some thought I don't feel like it was too amazing.. chicken was cooked well and was moist, and the Truffel creme fraiche was the savior... Put that on top of anything you eat and you got yourself a winner.   We also got some small dishes to balance with the meat:  Bigeye Tuna - shaved foie gras, stone fruit; I would say pass on this, it sounds good but it wasn't to my liking.  Spicy Cucumbers - togarashi, toasted almond; very tasty and full of flavor, it was light and refreshing. Chinese Broccoli - black garlic, ginger; cooked well and tasted good but it's like anything you would typically get at a Chinese restaurant.   I also got a cocktail for myself called Toki Thyme, I really liked the drink! It was well mixed and refreshing to drink throughout dinner.   Final thoughts: Service was okay, our waitress forgot about us a few times. The atmosphere of the venue and view of the Las Vegas strip was cool and chill, especially accompanying hip hop music playing in the background.  The presentation and deliverance of the dishes were great but the food itself was just okay. I feel everything may have been too hyped up and it just fell a bit short for me. Good experience but I wouldn't come back again.",

Great decor, modern upbeat venue starring awesome food!  We did lunch, very affordable & great share dishes with my GFs.  Spicy cold ramen bowl, shishito peppers beet salad with ume dressing & chicken, oh so yummy!  I'll need to return to work my way through the menu. Service was great!  Music was a little loud, but upon request, they turned in down.  No validated parking, valet cost $13 (could have self-parked for $7), worth every penny, thank you for a great lunch!  A pleasant lunch before hitting the outlets!  Go GFs!",

The pork belly bun was good, but not worth the price point of $7 per bun. I understand that Momofuku is inside The Cosmo and on the Strip of Vegas, but this the type of place I'll visit once and remove from my bookmarks.  The pork belly ramen broth was missing something. I've had my fair share of ramen from restaurants throughout NorCal and SoCal, but didn't find anything special about Momofuku's. We ordered an extra egg, which came on the side - but we did not receive an egg in the actual bowl the ramen came in. I had to flag down our waiter to ask for the egg. After splitting the ramen into two bowls, we had a little bit leftover in the original bowl. A different waiter asked if we were finished and if he could take it, but didn't ask to take the empty plates from the buns we finished. We thought this was odd.   I was so excited to try Momofuku, especially after watching all the Ugly Delicious episodes. 3 stars for the service, ambiance, and decent food.",

There's hoisin sauce inside but you're given another spicy sauce on the side.  We also got the shoyu pork ramen and the scallion noodles. Coming from California, I've had my decent share of ramen, but the broth here is different. At first taste I thought it was bland but it's probably since I usually get tonkotsu broth which is usually creamy and richer. That being said, I don't mind a lighter tasting broth at Momofuku, it's just different for me since I expected a different depth in the flavor and perhaps saltiness of the broth. The noodles changed the game for me and are very good, as they have a lot of bounce in texture just how I like it. The scallion noodles were ok but refreshing with a lot of cucumbers and sour tasting mushrooms mixed in. I probably should've added some spicy sauce on the side. Overall, I expected more from the noodle bar but the pork buns were awesome. The service was prompt but the prices could be better, but then again it's a popular place. Would come again another time to try something else",

    "text": "4.5 / 5 - Pork Bun and Chicken Karage Bun. Oh and make sure you break the yolk in your Pork Ramen.   Momofuku is a great restaurant tucked in the corner of the second floor of the Cosmopolitan. I had high expectations of this place, and for me, it did not disappoint... Now did it live up to my unreasonably high expectations? Probably not, but Momofuku is a restaurant I would eat at again, and again, and again, especially if I'm dealing with a throbbing hangover in Vegas.  Let's start with the buns.  I'm usually a pork bun type of guy, and while the bun was great, the star of the show for me was the Chicken Karage Bun. I'll chalk it up to one of those weekends where having something fried feels better than something braised. The bun's hits you from different angles, but its really the red sauce that completes the dish.  Make sure you add it and don't be shy. 5/5  Moving onto the Ramen, which was a nice gourmet take on your traditional ramen. The roasted pork gave a smoky taste, while the pork belly provided a more sweet and savory taste. It was very complex, yet, the broth didn't blow me away. That was, until I popped the yolk and let it mix with all the flavors in the bowl.  My world changed and this ramen went from 'yeah it's pretty good' to 'damn, I should have did this earlier'.  I have a few ramen joints I like better in LA, but this is a solid choice. I would definitely consider coming here after a night (or day) of partying. 4/5  Service was awesome, and the ambience is a near match for the Cosmo's styling.  The breakdown:  Food: 4.5/5 Service: 5/5 Ambience: 5/5  Dessert at Milk is amazing as well. I'll save that review for another time though, but if you had to get a few things here, make sure it is one of the buns and the dessert from milk.",

For appetizer we went for: -Pork belly bun, the belly was tender, complements the soft bun. Don't forget to put the sauce, without it, it'll be a bit bland.   -PEI muscle with bacon and caramelized onion. This was such a hit with the table. It was a peppery, smokey bacon and juicy muscle.  -The citrus beet salad was a bit sweet, cold and refreshing appetizer.   Also ordered the pork belly ramen (it wasn't shown on the menu anymore, but super cool of them to  let us to order it). The ramen came with poached egg that were supposed to mix in the ramen to make it creamy. However, I found that the ramen lacks in flavor, it needed some extra salt and chilly.  Overall, excellent service, and considering the location it wasn't a bad place. However the ramen itself was a bit of a let down.",

We dropped in for a quick meal/snack.  Their chilled noodle was surprisingly good.  It tasted mostly of basil with a kick.  I think even if you aren't too health conscious, it's a dish that can still be enjoyed.  Of course, get the chasu buns (the shrimp was good too).  I can't attest to a longer dining experience with tons of dishes, but stepping in for a quick meal is definitely a possibility!",

    "text": "To me, Momofuku is the typical Las Vegas over-hyped restaurant. Very small portions for insane prices. I mean pickled vegetable for $15? What has the chef been smoking to charge these prices?   We had the bite-size, $14 buns (Pork Belly - hoisin, scallion, cucumber). They lacked sauce, crunch and left us wondering again about the mental state of the chef. Their noodle bowls again seem small for the price and not much to crave for.   I say if you're coming from the part of the country that doesn't have picked veggies or noodles and you're stuck at Costmo and can't walk anywhere (maybe broken legs and hands) and are dying of hunger, then spend some money at this place. Otherwise, there're plenty of better places.",

Our server was knowledgeable, made sure we got the most for our money and hilarious. We ordered the chicken karaage with caviar, eggplant, lobster & shrimp, pork chops, wedge less wedge salad, rice cakes and pork buns. My favorites were the chicken karaage, eggplant, lobster & shrimp and pork buns. All paired with some delicious kimchi and some amazing sauce they gave us for the pork buns (but that I used on 75% of my meal). We also ordered a really great sake. I found the pork a little dry and the wedge salad was unremarkable but I really enjoyed the meal overall and the service really brought it to the next level. This should be a must visit when in Vegas or New York.",

First of all, the interior decor is on point - definitely the most beautiful ramen restaurant I have ever been to. With that said, sometimes I find that the more beautiful the restaurant (excluding fine dining), the less tasty the food. This is no exception.  The pork ramen was by no means bad, but it was not wheorth the hefty price tag. The noodles were decent, the broth wasn't very flavorful and the egg was mediocre. The best part of this dish was the pork itself which was tender and delicious. That was what saved the dish.   Service was great, the food not so much. Probably wouldn't come back here.",

Elevated dining room with a view and very cozy (not like the front of the restaurant). Our waitress asked if we would be interested in family style dining, with the chef's selections. One of our friends is allergic to oysters and we told her that was our only dietary restriction. They started bringing out one amazing dish after another, every single one selected by the restaurant chef not any one of the diners in our group. We were blown away by the presentation, service, variety of the dishes, taste... everything! Wow, you guys impressed all of us. Thank you for a wonderful start to a fun weekend!",

    "text": "I have to agree with Michael T; it's always hard to review an Asian (fusion) spot when you've been to a lot of Asian restaurant and are familiar with the food.  And to be perfectly honest, I did not have too high expectations considering is 1. a well-known chain from New York City (NEW YORK CITY! ), and 2. right in the middle of the Las Vegas Strip (and in the Cosmopolitan nonetheless).   But Momofuku did prove me wrong.  We went on a Saturday for lunch and while the menu was limited, we tried enough to have our bellies satisfied.  Keeping it simple:  Pros: - gorgeous, spacious ambience; - they accommodated our party of 8 right away with no wait time; - the baos - I've had my share of baos and the pork belly bao was simple and good - CHICK PEA RAMEN -- finally, something different from the regular ramen!  And we're not just talking regular boiled chick peas, but crispy (likely flash-fried) chickpeas. What a delicious and original surprise, and the broth and noodles were delicious. I can still taste it now. - Dessert - I had already planned to go to Milk Ice Cream Bar next door and since it's from the same owner, we were able to have our ice cream in the restaurant, which was perfect! I had the crack ice cream and while it was delicious, it could have used a little crispiness to go with the soft serve.  Cons: - none that I can think of...$18 for a bowl of Ramen seems a bit steep but let's remember that you are in Las Vegas - wish that some of the dinner menu were offered during the daytime  Otherwise - I was pretty impressed, and now I know where to get a great bowl of Ramen in Vegas!",

I can totally see non-Koreans being impressed by the \"unique\" flavors, but to me, It just tasted like hipster Korean fusion. The food is definitely catered to the non-Asian palette. However, I was impressed with the level of service and efficiency. The food arrived promptly and my water glass was refilled so many times, I was the most hydrated I've ever been in Vegas!",

    "text": "Momofuku has been around for a while now but I never got the chance to try it until recently. I very much enjoyed my experience at Major Domo in Los Angeles and was hoping for the same here at Momofuku. Located in the Cosmopolitan hotel in Las Vegas, the restaurant is beautiful, modern and airy.   We came here for lunch and were luckily seated right away, having just beaten the first lunch rush. Since this place was known for their buns, we all ordered our own Pork Belly Buns which came with hoisin sauce, scallions and cucumbers. Honestly, while tasty for what it was as expected, I'm not sure if I could justify spending $7 for just one bun. If you don't live in an area where buns are easily accessible, then give it a try but if buns are a popular \"it\" food in cities like LA, you could probably find the same thing for less that's just as good.   Now the Bo Sssam Rice Bowl sealed the deal for me. Glazed pork shoulder, kimchi rice and pickles put together is seriously one awesome flavor bomb. The pork shoulder was fall-apart tender and the kimchi rice was seriously addicting. The pickled vegetables were sweet, crunchy and vinegary. The perfect accompaniment to round off all the strong, heavy flavors. Although the bowl looked sort of small, it was actually quite deep and all of us who ordered it found ourselves with plenty of leftovers to bring back.",

    "text": "It's every bit delicious and imaginative as I remember after seeing David Chang detail Momofuku on his television shows.   The Pork Belly Bun: the meaty, fatty piece of pork belly is tender and melt in your mouth. Proportionally, it's super filling and rich so do come hungry. The light steamed bun, crisp cucumbers and specialty sauce that you can add helps to cut the richness. I devoured it all.   Pork Belly Slow Roasted Pork Shoulder Ramen: ramen isn't listed on their menu, but a server is more than happy to let you know what is available. I loved the broth, and I remember seeing on David Chang's how he creates his ramen broth. I'm not sure if it was the same broth I saw on tv but I can taste the love and care that went into it. Paired with a melt in your mouth chunk of pork belly, slow roasted pork shoulder, and a poached egg whose center was incredibly orange - it's ramen at its finest.   I'm glad I was able to dine here.",

    "text": "Perhaps I walked into this place with too high expectations from watching Ugly Deliciousness & Mind of a Chef. This pork ramen does not live up to its $17 price tag.  I have had a lot of delicious ramen recently.   Let's breakdown the ramen. Overall, the momofuku ramen is certainly below par. The only saving grace are the chewy Sun Brand noodles and the perfectly poached egg. The shoyu broth is on the Japanese authentic salty side but lacks the umami-ness of a 12 hr broth. The chopped pork shoulders reminds me of a bad southern barbecue. It lacks seasoning. The pork belly was good but difficult to eat in one bite.   All together, I feel like you'll be paying for all the marketing of David Chang and not for the food itself. With so many other choices in the area, this will be a one & done experience for me.",

    "text": "Dave Chang's Vegas restaurant lived up to the hype and then some for me. I've visited twice but have yet to try their pricier large-format menu items, with combinations like fried chicken and caviar or salt and pepper lobster and shrimp- maybe someday! That said, a recent weekend walkup lunch for two was great and our total was less than we'd expected for the quality of our meal.  I've genuinely enjoyed almost everything I've had here, from the lamb ribs (so gamey, great sauce!) to the bossam (share with a friend!), and sides like garlic noodles (simple but so good). Their bao are sold in single-orders for ~$7, and I preferred the chicken over the pork belly.  I have not yet tried the chirashi (priced at a cool $42) or the ramen, but this is on my short list of places I recommend regularly to friends coming to Vegas specifically for food.   NOTE: There's a limited \"afternoon\" menu (daily, 3-5:30PM) and late night bar menu (11PM-midnight). Pop next door for dessert at MilkBar afterward.",

I have a small goal to try and actually pre-order for fried chicken and caviar if I come here next time with some dessert. Hadley is the best server I have had the pleasure of meeting in my years of Las Vegas trips with friends or family and he made my first visit here great to where I want to come back later this year! He was the most caring and accommodating server I have also met too. Momofuku is a great place and I definitely recommend it!",

    "text": "Tucked inside the Cosmopolitan, Momofuku Las Vegas is a flavorful ride. If you make a reservation, you'll get to sit inside of the dining room and avoid the high top tables.  I wish I remembered our waiter's name - he was warm and full of good recommendations, chatty and personable. There was also a young man whose main job seemed to be setting up the table settings, refilling water, and very silently sliding a fork and knife next to people who he thought needed it (there were only chopsticks on the original table setting).  We started with an order of pork belly buns, which come two per order ($14) with pork belly, hoisin sauce, pickled cucumber, and scallions tucked into a pretty standard bao. I would have liked the cucumbers to be a bit more crunchy, but the pork belly itself was tasty. The bao was not my favorite I've ever had - a bit soggy for my taste.  My partner got the grilled striped bass ($28), which came with kimchi butter, mushrooms, and snow peas. The kimchi butter was pretty tasteless, but the skin was crispy perfection and salty.  That didn't stop him for stealing glances (and bites) of my dish - the bo ssam bowl ($17), with glazed pork shoulder, kimchi rice, and various pickles. I added an egg for $2, and that made all the difference - big thank you to my waiter for recommending it! The pork shoulder was a little too sweet, the cucumbers a little too thin, but everything mixed together made for bite after perfect bite. This was a fantastic lunch.  Add in a quick stop at Milk Bar afterwards, and you have all the ingredients for a perfect meal!",

It's only 4 of us but we're so full we have to take the rest for to go!  Pork Bun and Chicken Karage is wow!!!  Shoulder braised pork is phenomenal!  Service was great too! David Chang must thank his people for a job well done! They're totally doing their job with passion.  So why 4 stars?  Menu was a bit skeptical for me. You'll see ramen here on Yelp yet their Dinner menu (which we had by the way) isn't even there. I guess they have it but only for ramen bar seating. My bad that i didn't also even bothered to ask them but so far in all.. It's 4 stars!",

Beautiful and gracious hostesses, they were so welcome and we didn't even have a reservation but the bar would do it for us!  Watching chefs and line cook whipping up dishes with this open bar is priceless. Everything was clean, transparency, and love watching them executed each dish over and over again!  The Pork Chop Tomahawk with watercress was spot on, for under $50, it's a bargain and plenty to share for 2-3 people. That way you can try more dishes! That's how we dine out ;-)  The Spicy Cucumber Salad, togarashi, toasted almond, it was just perfect, not spicy at all.   Ginger Scallion Noodles, pickled shiitake, spicy cucumber, wakame was really good, on a slighter saltier side though.  Pork Belly Bun, hoisin, scallion, cucumber was PERFECT.  Mushroom Bun was a substitution for a colleague of mine do not eat pork! Unfortunately, this was overly salty! We appreciated our server Manny, he was spot on and very accommodating with us! Congrats on being a new dad!   Black Truffle Ramen, egg yolk, chive,   $50, generous freshly shaved black truffle, very well balanced broth. If you know me. I order truffle anywhere I go if it's FRESH!  This was my very 1st time to try fresh black truffle over ramen! And I really liked it!  They have awesome Large Format dishes. To share if you have a group of 4 or more! Unless you are a fat ass like me, you order everythang on the menu and just take home later, HA! So my hotel room all stinky up the next day! But it's perfect for hang over! You know what I mean!   5 Spice Roasted Duck at $238, the whole rotisserie duck served with the leg confit over rice, bibb lettuce, chive pancakes, kimchi, hoisin, ssam sauce, ginger scallion sauce and fresh herbs.   This is the second most expensive duck in vegas, beside Hakkasan Caviar Duck Service! But it was good enough with all the goodies!  We will come back just for our server Manny & the Pork Belly Bun & the Truffle Ramen of course!  Menu changes so often here so it's a good thing!",

Damn am I glad I found out about this.  We were in Vegas for a friends bachelorette, and despite all of the fun clubs and nights out, going to Momofuku was the highlight of the trip for many of us.  We ate family style and ordered many things to share.  Every single thing was mind blowing and delicious.  This is next level eating.  I expected everything to be very small portions since it is such a fancy restaurant, but everything was the perfect size.   1. Pork belly buns- huge, meaty and so tasty. One of the highlights. 2. Spicy cucumbers- I am not a huge cucumber fan, but these were delicious with the seasoning and a great light starter. 3. Ginger scallion noodles-  The chili garlic noodles are probably more of a palette pleaser for me, but these were perfect.  The temperature, the textures all together.  A great flavor combination between the ginger, seaweed, and mushrooms. 4. Hozon rice cakes- my absolute favorite.  They were lightly fried and just barely crispy on the outside.  The sauce they were drenched in was absolute perfection 5. Hertiage pork tomahawk-  The most delicious dry rubbed bbq pork you could imagine.  It was beautiful with figs and peaches on top.    I can't even begin to describe the flavors all of these had- it was really a one of a kind experience that everyone should have!",

    "text": "Amazing & unique food! We made reservations on open table and came for dinner on a Thursday evening. Glad we made reservations because the restaurant was pretty full when we arrived!   I am a big fan of ugly delicious and wanted to try David Chang's food. We ordered a variety of food to try. My favorites were the lamb ribs, Brussels sprouts, and crack pie. The lamb ribs had a white sauce that was delicious and perfect. The Brussels sprouts and broccoli had a mildly spicy fish sauce seasoning that I really enjoyed as well. The pork belly in the pork bun was very tender and you can dip it in their house sauce. I wouldn't recommend the pork ramen because it tastes very ordinary and you can get it elsewhere for much cheaper than $17. The crack pie is also a must try if you have room for dessert. You are also allowed to order any of the treats from milk bar next door to eat at the dinner table.   There is a fee to park at cosmopolitan so we parked at planet Hollywood for free and walked across the bridge to cosmo to save money :)",

    "text": "Fare:  We ordered oysters on the half shell for an appetizer and shared the pork chop, Brussels sprout/cauliflower side and pork ramen. The oysters were delicious and fresh. Their briny nature was matched perfectly with a smoky acidic vinaigrette. We ordered a dozen and a half and still could have eaten more! I could not catch where the waiter said they were from, but they tasted exquisite regardless. For the main the pork chop was seasoned perfectly and our only (minuscule) issue was that it was slightly overcooked. We like meat rarer than most, so the cook critique is probably specific to just us and should not inhibit future foodies from ordering. The market side of Brussels sprouts and cauliflower was delightfully savory and surprisingly filling. The rice vinegar mayo and Katsu sauce really tied all the flavors together and was a perfect accompaniment to the pork chop. Finally, the ramen. I personally have never cared for ramen most likely due to the fact that I have never eaten good ramen before, but the pork ramen was out of this world! It is so simply beautiful, yet layered with a multitude of flavors and textures! I cannot sing its praises enough. The ramen is not on the dinner menu, but our waiter was happy to provide it nonetheless and honestly I had a life changing ramen moment!   For drinks we were torn as there were so many wines to chose from, but thankfully Momofuku had an onsite sommelier to help us (they also had a huge cocktail list but we are winos)! We were greeted with a splash of a sparkling rose upon arrival, then had a light acidic wine pairing for the oyster appetizer, and a light fruit-forward red to pair with our mains. All the pairings were spot on, the only complaint we had was how quickly they were presented. We didn't catch the names or even the types of wine served and would have loved to add them to our wine journal (we truly are winos).   Folks: Our waiter was amazing. He was present, funny, knowledgable, and flexible (read: RAMEN). He knew the menu well and guided us in all food decisions. It is such a breath of fresh air when folks really know the menu and can make great suggestions because they have actually tried the food. The sommelier made some fantastic pairings and really elevated the whole meal.  Feeling: A seductive, opulent setting with straightforward, down-to-earth food. You get the extravagance of Vegas with views of the strip, yet inside Momofuku the graffiti style art and intricate metal work make the restaurant feel like a sumptuous lounge removed from all the noise and chaos. The warm lighting is inviting and adds to the luxurious ambience. A great place to take a partner, impress business associates, or enjoy with fellow foodies, it will not disappoint!  tldr: Delicious, a must-try experience if in Vegas, and GET THE RAMEN",

I want to bottle the broth and drink it all day.  Wonderfully sublime. Service was a bit lacking, and we had to flag people down to get drink refills, but the food was so good, I wasn't bothered too much. If you are near the Cosmo, this is a must try for dinner.

A second time I visited for my birthday with a party of 7 and we tried the chefs choice option. We put in $50 a person (the minimum) and were treated to a 6 course meal including fried pepper appetizer, cucumber salad, ramen to share, lamb rack, baked chicken, and a kimchi and baked fish rice plate. It was all tasty and everyone walked away full. We agreed our favorite was actually the fried pepper appetizer. They were perfectly cooked with just a little crunch and lightly salted and peppered.

    "text": "This restaurant has a lot of great reviews but my experience was underwhelming.  It started with me asking the hostess if they have any tables open right now, they said yes, and then we were seated at the kitchen bar. Sorry, this is not a table.  Next, I ordered grilled lamb ribs. I don't know why they call it \"grilled\" lamb ribs when it is served out of the fryer and tastes deep fried. No grill flavor whatsoever. Second, I questioned whether it was lamb or not. It was cooked tender like pork ribs and if you told me it was pork I would've believed it. Basically it is super tender and drenched in sauce. Why use something more costly like lamb when you're going to mute the flavor by cooking the heck out of it and then drenching sauce all over it? Everything about this dish overpowered the meat flavor. I didn't need to pay $58 for something that tastes worse than bbq pork ribs for less than $20.  And then one of the chefs took it upon himself to tell us we need to eat it with our hands because it tastes better. Maybe we can if it was completely sliced for us and not half sliced? Also, if this chef thinks hands vs utensils makes a difference please someone help him. Don't get me wrong, I appreciate chefs who love their craft and will take their suggestion every time, but when you're serving me subpar food and then telling me I'm eating it the wrong way, that just doesn't work.  And then the ginger scallion noodles, might as well call it scallion noodles because the top was completely covered in scallions. Again with overpowering a dish.  I doubt I'll be back. Someone would have to beg me to give it a second chance.",

Unfortunately the two different groups of people sitting next to us in the restaurant completely ruined our experience. Our expectations were really high so when halfway through our meal the other two groups were loud, obnoxious, and then decided to combine tables and literally sit on top of us (on top of my purse to be exact) it just ruined our night. Management tried to help us out by moving our seat but we were already on our last dish. My expectations were so high that it disappointed me a lot because we couldn't enjoy our night. I know this experience was out of restaurants staff's control but it still was very annoying.  Everything we ate was delicious and seasoned perfectly. The shishito peppers were our favorite by far! The steak dish was cooked to perfection. I really hope I can visit another momofuku location to be able to try the food again and hope for a better time. 5 stars for the food, 3 stars for the environment that night.",

It's all about the \"Large Format Dining\" on the flip side of the menu.  Forget about date night, this place is meant to be enjoyed by groups looking to chow dooooown.  By leaving the budget, calorie count, and general fucks at the door is when David Chang's establishment really shines.  I haven't been the ssam since my first taste of their \"Bo Ssam\".   From the salty, fatty top to the juicy center to the delicious saucy bottom that I like to call \"pig candy\", this slow roasted pork shoulder has it all going on!  If someone really wanted to pinch pennies, the small version at $138 comes with all the fixings including rice, oysters on the half shell (which I still don't really get how this works with everything else), kimchi and various sauces all thrown into bibb lettuce for some ugly delicious tacos that would easily feed 4 people.  The \"Rottiserie Duck\" is another Momofuckin amazing option as the bird is carved tableside and then piled on top of rice so all that wonderful juice/grease/fat/heaven seeps into it for amazing flavor.  They also deep fry the bones for a nice little snack on the side, but I find they're a little too heavy handed with the salt, so ask for it on the side or to go lighter on the sodium blast.    Imagine fish and chips taken up a stratosphere with the \"Salt & Pepper Lobster & Shrimp \".  This beast of a bowl arrives with 6 whole lobster tails and 16 gulf shrimp tempura battered, then fried, tossed with fried garlic, cabbage and chilies.  The tails were super juicy and so good that I even tried to eat the shell with a less than satisfactory result.   And then I can finish the meal off with my favorite overpriced cake? Hell yesssss!  Christina Tosi's Milk Bar \"Birthday Cake\" at $14 a slice or $60 for the whole cake, truly ends everything on a high note.  I would seriously eat here once a week if I could.  I do see fried chicken and caviar in my near future though.",

Nonetheless, it was a great experience. David Chang is the executive chef. The spot has good decor and nice ambiance. Ribeye was good, bbq pumpkin slices were good, wagyu potatoes were good, crack pie was simultaneously a little too sweet and a little too salty, but pretty good. I wasn't a fan of the cold n00dles... too much sauce. It's four star rating is legit per Fakespot (A rating). David Chang got even cooler in my eyes after watching the documentary on how he recognized that one of his employees had created a delicious product (the crack pie), threw his support behind her, encouraged her to spread her wings and start her own dessert & tea cafe (the Milk Bar Las Vegas, next door to Momofuku). That's the kind of boss you want!",

So i tried it, turned out to be the worst $48 i'd ever spent! It's basically just super dry overcooked chicken katsu with cream cheese dipping and a tiny quarter teaspoon of caviar. The worst combination.   2. Spicy cucumber: it's bitter  3. Shoyu Pork Ramen: broth is blend, no  4. Pork Belly Bun : okay not outstanding  5. Service : not attentive at all, we have to keep asking for water refill",

Mr. Mixologist thinks an old fashioned has vermouth and no sugar. When i tried to explain to him that what he was describing sounded like a Manhattan, he claimed that what i was thinking of was an \"old school\" old fashioned. Donkey.

I made a mental note on what I would order in the future if I had more compartments in my stomach. We ordered the famous pork belly buns, Momofuku oysters, ginger scallion noodles, fried Brussel sprouts, and ponzu citron lemonade which were all superstars in their own right. The fried Brussel sprouts was like crack and I don't usually like to eat them so thank you Momofuku for making me eat my veggies! The oysters was a spin on Rockefeller and let me tell you it's tastier than most I've had not to mention they were super fresh Fanny Bay oysters! I'm an oyster and uni snob...I know!! The servers were knowledgeable and attentive. Would come back again in a heartbeat with tons more people so I could sample everything on the menu! Make reservations ahead of time I just stumbled upon this place while walking around Cosmopolitan and had to wait 45 mins. Oh and MILK is next door! Got the blueberry and marshmallow cookie to go! Overall we were content with our service and meal. We left happy and recharged to take on the rest of Vegas! Oh and props to the chef with the knife tattoo on her right forearm she was so attentive to all the dishes she was putting out. Can tell she absolutely loved her job. It translates into the food!",

The hostess said the managers were in a meeting and that someone would call me back as soon as they were out. That was at 2:00pm on March 12, 2017. I can assure you that the hostess took down my information correctly because she repeated everything back to me. It is very disappointing that Momofuku does not care enough about their customers to follow up on serious issues such as food poisoning.  Although this was our first visit it will also be our last. We are very disappointed with how the entire situation was handled.",

I think that overall, the food and drinks were pretty good taste wise, but in the end, everything was so incredibly overpriced that I can't say that I love it. The cocktails and sake were definitely on the pricier side $15-$25, but came in amazingly small portions. The chicken Katsu with shiitake gravy alone was $32.. And when we received it, it was just a normal Katsu portion (maybe seven pieces after cutting) covered in sauce. The $32 did not even include rice. Each bowl was an additional $4. Sure, it tasted good but the value just was not there. Especially since Vegas has so many other great Japanese restaurants to offer that are so well priced. Trust me, I don't mind splurging on a meal, but I definitely want to walk away thinking \"Wow, that meal was worth it.\" Not \"Wow, how did we spend almost $200 on a few buns, chicken Katsu, and some drinks.\"  On a side note, service and atmosphere were great. I just wish the prices made a little more sense.",

    "text": "I've gone to my fair share of Momofuku restaurants and I think there is a wrong way and a right way to approach this place.  If you view the restaurant as simply an \"asian restaurant\" - I think that's the wrong way.  Momofuku is famous, I think, because it masters cultural complexity when it comes to food and then each restaurant bears the signature of the head chef and thematic context of the restaurant. Momofuku Nishi and Momofuku Ko are more like cousins then they are brothers, related but different in kind and style. Momofuku Las Vegas takes some of all the different family members and brings them together to Las Vegas. As a result, patrons that come to Las Vegas have the chance to partially experience the variances, spanning from Sydney, Australia to Toronto, Canada to it's birthplace of New York City. To understand that - is the first step in appreciating what this Momofuku has to offer. The second best thing about Momofuku Las Vegas is that it is the only place in Las Vegas (that I know of) that offers natural wine.  If you aren't familiar with natural wine, ask the sommelier and they'll likely give you a crash course on this distinct and amazing shift in the wine industry and has been spreading globally.  Before I knew what natural wine was, I tasted it and realized,  \"Yup. That's it. Not going back.\"    Third - come in a group and eat family style.   The ideal experience for me at Momofuku Las Vegas is in a large group. I'd call in advance and get the tables overlooking the view of the strip. The restaurant has this 1920's Hong Kong vibe, so I enjoy dressing up and funky.  The large group enables you to eat the food family style, which will maximize your opportunity to taste the spectrum that the menu offers.  That being said, they offer quicker cheaper dishes if you come in alone. If you come in a group and don't do it family style - you're an idiot.  Also, take a moment and taste the cocktails offered or ask the somm about their wines and choose a good bottle. If you come in and order a vodka soda, you're an idiot. Lastly, if you can afford it - get the caviar.   I love this place - from the music to the quality of staff to the amazing artwork by David Choe to the heated toilets and bedet.   In sum,  if you're not an amateur when u come in, it's definitely the best place on the strip.",

Having never been to the NYC flagship, I didn't know what to expect except for having always liked David Chang's presence on various food programs.  At first A Chef's Mind season one, later, Ugly Delicious.  As 8 giggly girls came here for the bachlorette party dinner, we opted for both of the noodles on the menu, oysters, some raw fish crudo, the lobster and shrimp dish, and rice cakes.  Every dish was delicious, and a bit ugly (lol)!  The lobster and shrimp dish especially, all piled up without much garnish or plating, topped with a brownish sauce.  But the texture and taste are exceptional!  Whatever the batter they use to fry up that seafood is just perfect.  Their noodles were also amazing, which is not surprising given that's how Momofuku started their fame.  The ramen is perfectly al dente, and the flavors are just right.  The ginger scallion one tasted like a dry version of soupy ramen, and the chilled spicy one was like a good looking hapa love child of an Italian and Thai couple.  Also worth mentioning: They serve some of the best cocktails I've ever had!   Finishing the meal with crack pie, soft served ice cream, compost cookies and the birthday cake, it was one memorable meal I would love to come back to for sure.",

    "text": "I wasn't sure what the hyped about this place beside it being new and popular in New York and other countries.  However, my overall dining experience here was alright, nothing too spectacular.    We decided to dine here while in Vegas and saw this place had 4 stars rating from yelp; let's try it out shall we?  Well I wish I could give this restaurant a 4 stars too, but I thought what we had went through from service to food, and the overall were all just average.     We dined here on a Saturday evening.  We didn't have any reservation that day and luckily after 10-15min of wait time, we were seated at the bar / open kitchen dining area.    LOCATION - located at the Cosmopolitan Hotel on the 2nd floor, next to Milk Bar.  HOURS from their Main website Lunch:        11:00am - 2:30pm Afternoon    2:30pm - 5:00pm Dinner:         5:00pm - 11:00pm  Late Night   11:00pm -2:00am  SERVICE - Our server that night was a guy/ bartender guy (forgot his name, Caucasian/semi Hispanic lookin with stylish hair cut).   ---Not sure if he was too busy making drinks and forgot about the \"customers\" in front of him, but he didn't seem to care much about us throughout the whole dining experience.   --- He got our orders out and basically just left us there doing our own thing.   ---He didn't even check up on how was our food or if we had wanted any desserts?  ----It's not like we had sat 5-10 feet away from him then I can assume that he must be super busy, but we were right in front of him eye to eye.     ENTREES AND FEEDBACKS:   **SPICY CUCUMBERS** $7 -chunky cucumber, togarashi (Japanese chili powder), toasted almonds, scallions.  There was this green sauce, but wasn't sure what it was.  This dish was ok; at some point some of the cucumber had a hint of bitterness in them which I assumed it was from the cucumber skin.    **PORK BELLY BUN** $7 (1 Order) - 1 thick pork belly, hoisin sauce, scallions, and sliced cucumbers.    I would recommend you try this dish.  The thick pork belly was very tender; eat this with their \"Ssam\" sauce (similar to Korean gochujang- that red chili paste you see in a lot of Korean dishes.)    **CHICKEN KARAAGE** $7 (1 order) - spicy mayo sauce, pickled red onions, shredded iceberg lettuce.  When I hear \"Chicken Karaage,\" I picture this as a crunchy fried chicken.  However, our chicken didn't come out crispy or crunchy but more of a soggy seared chicken on a bun.    **PORK RAMEN** $18 - Yes, ramen can cost this much people, which is a bit pricy to my opinion.  This ramen included: 1 thick pork belly piece, shredded pork belly shoulder, 1 poached egg, seaweed, fish cake sliced, bean sprouts, and green onions.    - The ramen was ok, but it was so SALTY.   Everything else in the ramen was good if only the chefs cut down on the salt here. -  OR at least please have a taste test of the broth before serving it out to your customers.    OVERALL - I think Momofuku was alright.  Would I come back?  Maybe, I would come back for the pork belly bun only, but not much of the other dishes.   It was nice to sit at the open kitchen where you get to have a full view of all dishes being made in front of you, but then again the great service wasn't quite there.  I was glad to try this popular restaurant out and you should try it out once and see for yourself too.",

The bar has a really cool decor and laid back vibe and good tunes playing. I believe Eric B.& Rakim was on the box as we were seated so, oh yeah, it's time for drinks. I had an IPA. The wife ordered a bourbon cocktail which she wasn't really feeling so she asked for the Mojito Slushie instead. Our server, Caesar was happy to oblige. He gladly whisked it away and apologized. (not his fault) within minutes, bartender Josh showed up with the Mojito Slushie (delicious). and a complimentary order of the Spicy cucumber with toasted almond appetizer, which I assume was to make up for my wife's drink. This was totally unnecessary but so appreciated. We couldn't get enough of these cucumbers. Seriously, I could've just had a giant bowl of these, a spoon, another beer and I'd have been set!  The pork belly bun was one of my favorites. that pork was really tasty, seasoned great and just fatty enough. The bun was very fresh made and very soft. It was great. The pork ramen was also delicious. I understand it's hit and miss for alot of poeple here and I'm no ramen expert by any means but I found it to be very good, perhaps a tad on the salty side but the slow poached egg added a fantastic richness to the salt of the pork and the delicious broth. My wife ordered the chilled spicy noodles which were also killer. They were almost like a tasty cold noodle salad with just the right amount of spicy bite, so good.  We also had to try the Crack Pie a la mode for dessert  but we weren't really feelin it. This Crack pie just wasn't our thing.   I thought the portions were just right. Again, our server's name was Caesar and he was on point. He never left us hanging and we felt well taken care of. Props to bartender Josh on those Mojito Slushies and his great service as well. Also we had an issue with a receipt after we left, (totally my fault) so i had to return the following day to talk to Richard, the manager on duty.  (I believe that was his name, accent, glasses?)  He was extremely helpful in resolving my issue, which i felt bad about because he had to search through receipts from the day prior which I'm sure ate up a bit of his valuable time. He was extremely professional in assisting me and quickly took care of the problem and seemed happy to help us. The entire staff here really tacked on the 5th star for us.   We had a great overall experience at Momofuku. We loved the food. The staff and service were top notch all the way around. We'll be back next time to try dinner.",

It was easy to converse.  Larger tables are round with lazy susans.  Plates were easy to share. The staff was attentive. We ordered the cucumbers to start followed by the smoked ham which came with delicious mayo and 3 madeleines.  The sticky buns with pork belly were delicious as was the plum sauce. There was enough fat and crispness.  (Glad that we got two!)  Last we had lamb ribs which was a very rich dish and we had a hard time finishing.  I'd come back the next time we're in Las Vegas.",

    "text": "Momofuku.  Just the name itself is cute and makes you want to go out of your way to Cosmo. For the style of food, I think it's appropriately located in such a chic hotel.   I heard great things about Momofuku in New York and I was super excited they opened one here. After a night of heavy partying (c'mon it's Vegas), carbs sounded like a good idea.   If you know me, I'm like addicted to ramen. In fact, I even have a dedicated Yelp list for ramen.   I came with a group of 3 for lunch and it wasn't too packed. Their menu is simple but has enough range for your every craving.   Appetizer: Shishito Peppers, Sweet & Sour Snap Peas and Smoked Pork Belly  Main dish: Chickpea Ramen  The appetizers were a great start to the meal and it was worth its value. That pork belly though, was filled with delicious fat that basically gave your mouth a foodgasm. Just think of Shokugeki for you foodie lovers :)  The chickpea ramen also did not disappoint. Although service took a little long for it to come out, the pacing was good because we took our time with the appetizers and drinks.   The chickepea combination was different and I'm not sure I would want it again the next time. I wasn't expecting the chickpeas to be fried so that was a surprise. I think it was the smart way, too, to give more texture to the bowl. This ramen did not have a lot of toppings as I usually like. The bok choy was tasty and I wanted more of that. No egg, which I was slightly disappointed. However, despite all unexpected surprises, the noodles were AMAZING. It was the kind of width, length, and texture that I look and love. The broth was also amazing. It was not fatty or oily but still carried a lot of richness that you couldn't know by looking at it. The ramen was lovely and rejuvenated my day.   But the best part? As Milk Bar is next door, you can order their desserts here, too!!!!  I think they secretly want us to sit til dawn or something.   Our waiter was FANTASTIC and the overall experience was nothing but great. Yummy food paired with good company and service deserves 5 stars.",

I enjoy that dish a lot. Reminds me of Nam Vang ( a Cambodian dry noodles). We also got truffle potatoes and oysters. I would never order those two ever again. There was no taste of truffle in the potatoes. The oysters was so small and the taste of corns and kimchi in it was weird. I'm def coming back here next time to try their meat and seafood.",

They did not lie!!! The dish is brought to table side to be carved - very dramatic. There are 3 options for eating it. In a chive pancake (looks a lot like a very large crepe), in bibb lettuce, or on your plate over rice. There are several sauces brought to the table to use (hoisin sauce if you make a wrap with the pancake, a spicy kimchi sauce if you go with a lettuce wrap, and more). It is served with a huge bowl of perfectly cooked rice. They take the carcass and deep fry the bones. Very salty but very good to eat as a side to the duck meat. The menu says it serves 3 to 6. The portion is huge, so 4 very hungry folks or 6 with normal appetites. And while $218 may seem a lot for a single dish, when you figure it is going 4 to 6 ways, it is not bad at all. do not miss this dish.",

He was friendly and very attentive and so were the other servers. Our water glasses were always being refilled.   We started with one appetizer and got the shishito peppers. Didn't really care much for it since it didn't have much flavor and they were sweet.   Next we ordered the famous buns (btw it's only two per order): chicken karaage, shiitake, and pork belly. Don't forget to put the spicy saam sauce! Personally my favorite was the shiitake bun! It was sweet and flavorful.   Our main entree was the Rotisserie Chicken & Fried Bones and the Black Winter Truffle ramen. Entrees are served family style.. about 3-4 people. Even though the Black Winter Truffle ramen is a little pricey.. it's definitely worth trying! Very flavorful! The chicken was good too.. but the ramen really won my taste buds!",

At the end of the party, when you're full and a tad drunk, you feel...well...for lack of a better term...good. But not just any type of good. It's the type of good that makes memories. The type of good that makes you want to come back. That's what I felt leaving Momofuku. I can talk about the delicious noodles with a mix of scallops and mussels or the fried mussels or the superb pork belly bun, but it was the way they welcomed me and my family in that made me feel...good.   As we arrived at our seats, the server was ready and welcomed us in with a complimentary glass of sake. From there, as we ate all the aforementioned deliciousness above and more, the cooks behind the counter -- as we were sat on the opposite side of the food line -- were incredible hosts that entertained us with conversation and free bites. Literally the easiest, high-class service in a restaurant I've ever experienced. And I say this specifically because I can sometimes feel that I must put on such a proper face for good food service instead of just being myself sometimes.   Truly a magnificent experience, I will not soon forget my time here and already am longing for the next time. Truly a must when in Sin City.",

The menu is rather limited, and the only entree that appealed to us was the pork ramen. Everything else was either really expensive, or appetizer sized. So, we got three pork ramens with three pork belly buns.   Sounded like a good idea at the time, but it ended up being too much pork belly - I didn't think such a thing was possible! The pork belly bun was definitely the highlight - a generous slab of pork belly sandwiched between a Chinese bao, along with some picked cucumbers and some kind of sauce. Unfortunately, we were so full from the ramen that we ended up having to take the buns to go, and it made the perfect midnight snack!  The ramen, meanwhile, was pretty standard. Fatty slices of pork belly in a soy sauce broth with thin noodles and your standard ramen toppings (seaweed, bamboo, etc.). Good, not overly salty, but definitely didn't wow me either. Our server was a perky blond woman and very attentive.  Overall, it was cool to finally be able to say that I tried Momofuku but it definitely left a lot to be desired :\\",

Assistant waitress commented that David Chang had just been there last week to train some new hires - \"intense\" she said.  I wonder if its because he was upset with how the restaurant was performing.    Food - Pork buns were great.  No issues.  Pork Ramen - noodles over cooked.  Way over cooked.  Chickpea Ramen - thicker noodles, but same issue.  Kim Chi Bowl - dry and boring.  Hamachi Sashimi - fish was not fresh, we even found ourselves chewing on fish scales.  Pickled radish garnish was so salty and sour, probably to mask the hamachi situation below it.  I was really disappointed, and I had expected a really decent meal to follow all medium to high standards for Japanese cooking.   I really wished we had a better review, but we ended up with a really disappointing two hundred dollar lunch for 5.",

If you don't know who David Chang is by now and need to research him, you probably won't appreciate the food at Momofuku as much as you should. He's not an infallible chef by any means, but he definitely is past the point of needing to be researched and reviewed.  I came in about an hour before kitchen closed on a Saturday night to order some buns to go. Erick the Bartender took care of me. Super cordial and talked story with me to keep me company while I waited for my food to come out. We had a hiccup with my order somehow and they said we needed to re-do it? no idea what happened, but i had plenty of time to spare so i said bring it out whenever. the very kind Erick the Bartender felt bad and ordered a comped cucumber salad, even though i said it was completely unnecessary. when the food was finally brought out by a Mustached Gentleman, I found out they tried to make it up to me and essentially doubled my order, along with a comped side. all good food aside, this Momofuku location sure knows how to treat their customers. i assured them it was an unnecessary gesture, but they wanted to make their small wrong right. very sweet.  thanks Momofuku for another standup experience. love to love you",

Shrimp buns were decent as well as decently overpriced (but what isn't here). I would not recommend getting pork buns if you are already getting the pork ramen since it will be pork overload.  18 dollar for ramen and 8 dollar for the bun though..",

Even the ramen is some of the best we've had, even compared to some of the best dedicated ramen joints, here or Japan.  Sides dishes, apps, any noodle dish and cocktails are all good, and different enough that you feel like you're getting something that has some creativity behind it.  I get the hype...it's really good food and another win for the Cosmopolitan restaurant collection!",

I loved how the shrimp bao bun was a shrimp patty full of shrimpy flavor. The chickpea ramen was amazing. The broth is extremely buttery, which makes it rich and thick and delicious for vegetarian ramen. If you don't like butter, don't get it. Lastly the spicy chicken sandwich was perfect. The chicken was juicy and crunchy and quite spicy! The meal was rich and flavorful and definitely a nice treat/cheat meal for someone who usually chooses lighter choices.",

The coffee (red eye mayo) was interesting and when eating all 3 together it was reminiscent of bacon and maple some how.... The Chilled Spicy Noodles - sichuan sausage, thai basil, candied cashew for $15 was really delicious. The pickled hot peppers really added the flavour and the basil was cooling and balancing. Hubby got the pork Raman that's not on the menu but is still available upon request. Over all great service and good food.

The food had very unique ingredients and an interesting blend of flavors, but the dish we had (spicy chilled noodles with Thai basil) was too heavy handed on the jalapeno spice and we had to pick them out lest our dish taste like a bowl of jalapenos with a side of noodles. Buns (pork belly and shrimp) were good but way overpriced. $7 for a single bun! Aye. Oh and just FYI they charge you for water here. Buyer beware.",

It is so rare to find a meal where you have a perfect blend mix of sweet, salty, and spicy in one. Perfect in every bite and I would definitely recommend the chilled noodles if you are not scared of spice. Enjoy!",

    "text": "It's already a good start when I love saying the name of the restaurant and Momofuku is a fun little tongue twister. The restaurant is pricey, but the selection of food offered is incredibly interesting and tastes just as good as it looks.   The restaurant may look small when you first walk past the podium, but located in the back is a large space with plenty of booths and wooden tables. The glass windows all around make for a great view and the kitchen is exposed to the dining room so you can see all the chefs at work. For our appetizers, my family chose the hamachi sashimi and salted cucumbers while for entrees we shared the scallion noodles, chilled Thai-spice noodles, and the pork ramen.   The hamachi sashimi plate is a small portion, but the flavors are huge. Each slice of hamachi melted on your tongue and the dressing was unbelievably refreshing. I even liked the thin slices of orchids on top. As for the cucumbers, it was amazing how something so simple, could taste so addictive. I especially enjoyed eating the cucumber with the peanuts, creating a nice contrast in textures.   When all the noodle dishes arrived, it was hard to pick a place to start. The chilled noodle dish was definitely the most colorful with the green, Thai-spice paste. It clung to every noodle strand, every peanut, and every piece of crispy, pork sausage. But don't let the cool green color full you. THIS IS ONE SPICY DISH!   The scallion noodles were warmer and topped with seaweed, shitake mushrooms, and scallions. The sauce was light, but still packed a strong umami flavor. The noodles tasted hand made, having that perfect \"al-dente\" bite. The ramen bowl smelled the best of all three and I was practically drooling when I saw that poached egg. Spearing it with the chopstick, I watched with mesmerized eyes as a golden ooze melted into the broth. The pork belly is also sinfully fatty and tender while the broth is light.   We had so many styles of noodles, but each dish was vastly different from the last. The variety in flavors and the execution of each entree was wonderful. Portions are a bit on the small side and prices are definitely on the high side, but what else is new when you come to a restaurant in Vegas?  At least here at Momofuku, you leave happily full.",

I still haven't eaten at the restaurant but I absolutely love the milk bar.   Hands down you have to get the cereal milk and the crack pie. I have so many regrets only getting a slice of crack pie. I need to get the full size next time because it lives up to it's name. It's crack and it makes you want more. It is so good!",

I believe the best way i can describe the taste is just simply deliciously refreshing!   Also you have to i repeat you have to order the pork baos....i know i know you can go to a regular canto restaurant and order some baos for way cheaper but this pork here is amazing! I dont even know like, just order it because not only was it juicy, fatty and greasy (which btw are the three key words to tasty kingdom), it had a complex blend of flavor and texture that only angels of food kingdom can possibly bequeath upon you...  Service was spot on, water was constantly being refilled, i now worship david chang!",

I came back for the ramen and it was unquestionably THE best ramen I've ever had, and if you pay attention to my reviews, I've had quite a lot. But to be fair, it was THE most expensive ramen I've ever had!  Black Winter Truffle Ramen ($58) - Without the truffle, it's a simple Ramen with an egg yolk and green onions.  But the black truffle, at almost $1200 per pound of this stuff, is the star of the dish obviously.  When your bowl arrives, so does a server to cut fresh shavings to your taste. Of course for me, pile it on!  It was delicious, it was fun, but to be honest, I probably won't have it again. The most expensive ramen may be the best ramen, but in general these noodle bowls are all great - I hope to come back again to have those others.  Maybe David can even add Tsukemen, which I know he studied in Japan - I'd love to try that!",

Everything I tasted was really delicious but I especially loved my dish.   I opted for the fried fish with lettuce wraps (sorry I forget the exact name!) and it was amazing! It was a build your own type of plate with seasoned rice, kimchi, crispy fried fish, a type of aioli, and tender butter lettuce leaves to wrap it all up - oh so good!!

Salmon egg was a little too salty.   Tuna with Foie Gras Shaving: interesting. Though I'm not a big fan for tuna, the Foie Gras was a nice touch.   Pork Belly Bun: Perfect. The bun was fluffy and meat was tender and tasty.   Chicken Katsu: Skip. I thought it'd be the one I saw on yelp photos with creamy mushroom sauce but it was different. Didn't really like the sauce. The chicken was fried perfectly though with a nice crunch.   Truffle Ramen: Okay. Very fragrant with truffle aroma. But the soup was on the lighter side unlike tradition Ramen.   Spicy Cold Noodle: My favorite. Noodle was chewy.  Lots of flavors in it.   Birthday Dessert Cookie: too sweet for my taste but bf loved it.   Cocktails: seven spice, jade dragon, mezcal mule are all very good. Refreshing and little spicy.",

So we went in for dinner and ordered the pork belly, naaaah it was not seasoned well , the pork I mean and was too bland! In short they just placed pickled cucumbers and put some pork belly and bam you have yourself a pork belly bun, for the ramen, the shoyu ramen that we ordered was okay the veggie cold noodles was weird tasting! Omg so in short we didn't have a satisfying dinner, it's okay- it does the job of keeping you full but that's it! It's not wow! It's so good I should try it again! I've had better ramen! The service was really good! They would always pour water for me! So try it yourself coz you might end up liking it! But to me and my husband we had the same opinion of it being just okay! Nothing spectacular to brag about!",

We just got back from our 2 day backpacking trip and were feeling for something a little fancy, but also fulfilling. Obviously, after eating freeze dried meals and granola bars. We deserve something delicious and unique! I ended up finding Momofuku. It's a known name in the culinary industry, because of David Chang.   We made a reservation day of and were seated right away. Ordered two cocktails, 24K Magic and Cherry Milk Punch. Please, please get the cherry milk punch if you're loving a slightly sweet and a great kick of rum! So delicious! With just my partner and I we ordered the biscuits with country ham which were amazing with the special butter they have on the side. The truffle and burrata served like a salad, but had incredible taste. We could've gone without the garlic scallion noodles, because there's already so much food, but if you can, I suggest you do get it! The mushrooms were amazing mix with the noodles and cucumbers. Yum! We also got the grilled Jidori chicken which we ended up asking for half (didn't think you could do that, so thanks to our waitress for suggesting that!). Overall, such a brilliant restaurant with amazing food and drinks. Really was the best way to end our backpacking in the Southwest and Vegas Trip!!",

I would definitely say that this location is a lot more pricey than the other one, but they have a lot more options. However, my review would be for the Ramen. Keep in mind that the Ramen here at this location is not on the menu that they first give you. You have to ask for the separate menu in order to check that out. It is still a little bit pricey but, it's pretty much the same price as the New York location. This is to be expected since it's located inside of the cosmopolitan hotel!

Made reservations for me and my husband on a Friday night, loved it so much that we convinced our friends to eat with us there the next day so we can try the bigger dishes lol The pork belly bun was so tender, the meat just melts in your mouth! The $300+ fried chicken was soooooo good! That skin was so tasty and perfectly crunchy! Cocktails were great, staff also great! We will be back for sure!!",

    "text": "Ohh Momofuku!  I am a creature of habit and ended up coming here three times in about a week while in Vegas!! I am also a sucker for GREAT service and good food.  I fell in love with David Chang watching him on Netflix like many people I'm sure did.  His restaurants in NYC are bookmarked in my Yelp as well.  Afraid it would be jam packed, I tried to go at not peak hours to ensure a seat at the bar.  Unfortunately, for what I perceive to be such a great restaurant, the bar was pretty empty with a few chairs for me to choose from on every occasion I went.   First things first, get the pork bun.  The hype is real people! And well deserved. The bun is perfectly fluffy and the bun to meat ratio is on point.  You are not ripping any bun off.  There is no dry bun sticking to the top of your mouth.  It is delicious and amazing, and I ordered two the first time I went.   Next, I ordered the momofuku oysters, which were good but I'm not sure I would order again, as they weren't cheap for six oysters, and while yummy, not what I expected.  Somewhat reminiscent of an oysters Rockefeller but done with kimchi, I thought it would be spicier for some reason?? No spice, but a nice breadcrumb crunch.  Great texture, pairs well with a beer, rather salty.  But in a good way. As long as you're into that.   On my next trip I ordered the pork bun again, the soft boiled egg appetizer and the pork ramen.  The soft boiled eggs I had to get after some serious envy from looking at my neighbor eat it the first time. It's two eggs, halved, soft boiled, with some caviar/roe sprinkled on top, as well as some other deliciousness.  You gotta like eggs to order this. (Duh).  I really enjoyed it, but you gotta love the briny pop of fish eggs as well as have an affinity for regular egg yolks.  After the appetizers I felt somewhat gluttonous, but knew what I came for, so out came the ramen.  Definitely their staple dish, it hit the spot for me.  We have no ramen in Miami (where I live) so this was as good as it gets for me.  Pork belly and shredded pork, noodles with a nice bite, salty but not too salty broth.  It's not a thick, tonkatsu broth, so don't order it if that's what you're going for.  Again, I am no ramen connoisseur so it was yummy to me.  Needless to say I was rolled out of there.   Finally, my last trip I ordered the spicy cucumbers and the chicken karaage appetizer.  The cucumbers were great and a nice respite from my typically fried and carb heavy choices.  And then back to my typically fried choices with the chicken, although it seemed very light.  Best thing about the chicken karaage (which is basically chicken fingers) is definitely the aerated hollandaise sauce.  I wanted to ask for more but refrained.   If you made it to this point in my review, I commend you, and will try to wrap up.  The customer service here was amazing!!! Dan the bartender, took care of me two of the three times I went to Momofuku and he was awesome.  On my second visit he introduced me to his colleague Justin who took care of me as well and remembered me when I came in the third time.  He subsequently introduced me to his colleague (Danny I believe) who also gave excellent service and chatted with me most of the time while also working a full service bar and helping other guests at the bar.  He was even able to order me the cereal milk ice cream from Milk Bar next door--which yes, does taste exactly like cereal milk, with I'm assuming homemade corn flake garnish, because it had an extra element of sweet/saltiness normal corn flakes don't have that was oh so yummy and contrasting.   As good as the food was, the service is why I had to write this review. Great pork buns and great service!!!",

    "text": "First night out of our girls weekend and excited to try the highly acclaimed Momofuku.   I must say we were highly disappointed. The menu highlighted large format dinners that would probably be good value but not easy to decide upon with a group.  We each decided to order a bun to start. Both the pork shrimp was tasty and good sized portions. The rest of the menu seemed odd to me. The lesser priced items from the noodles and then a big jump to their higher priced selection. To me, it didn't seem they had much of a selection in the mid range of $30-$40.  I enjoy great food and don't mind paying top dollar but the menu honestly didn't excite me enough. We decided on their noodle dishes. It was bland, with very little flavor. Wish they added some type of protein in top of the dish to make it feel complete.  Service was very slow and very inattentive. Dishes were dropped off to us and our server never really came back to check on us. Our plates sat in front of us when we were done for 20 minutes or so before we had to flag someone down to ask for the dessert menu. It even prompted me to ask \"Where IS our server?\" as the gal who took our order was never to be found afterwards. Seemed like the switched servers on us, quite confusing and a bit irritating.  Their cake was delicious and probably the highlight of our meal.  Restaurant was crowded and it was a fun atmosphere. Seemed like other tables who ordered the large format dinners received much better service than others. Too bad, this experience didn't live up to the hype to return.",

We'll be back soon! Pickled veggie plate was excellent with two terrific kimchis, cauliflower, beets and ginger. Shrimp buns were incredible, delicate fresh slightly sweet shrimp patties. Chicken soup was an excellent ramen bowl. Meatball appetizer was terrific, the black eyed peas with it stole the show. Samples of Brussels sprouts and sliced pork were wonderful. We sat at the noodle bar and really enjoyed interacting with the chefs and watching them work.   Second visit, equally amazing. Pork buns, Yellowtail sashimi, Momofuko oysters, chilled spicy noodles, a sample of spicy Sichuan rice cakes, all fantastic. Drinks again excellent. Our only repeat dish was the shrimp buns... otherworldly! A remarkable experience.",

From the bar service, we were pretty much know their service, not to mention about food. The service was terrible, the bar tender was very lack of motivation to  serve. At the beginning was a female bar tender handed us the menu in a piece of paper. Then she ran to some where to do her cleaning and totally ignored us, she seems a bit to hyper to wait for getting off from work. Some of the servers came in and asked her what's her plan for tonight. They just like chatting a lot during work and  obviously, more servers around than customers. The male bar tender was cleaning, and serve us with a black face all the time. Maybe he didn't have a good day. When we asked to taste the reisling which was from Austria and the other was Germany.  He was so reluctantly to serve us, and educated us in a unfriendly Mann that we thought we knew better than him. I knew he didn't want to do that little work to make the customers happy. And the other drink was that light that my hubby couldn't taste any alcohol. We were served with no napkins. So funny, so much servers were walking around, they didn't seem what they were doing, or what's customer service. The drinks were not cheap either.  Very first time and ladt",

It feels a bit more private in the back, but it may be reserved for large groups. (Our party was about 15)  Pre-Fix Price Paragraph: Okay, I want to start off stating I find it weird that EVERYONE pays a \"prefix\" menu, but not everyone get the same amount of food. For example, we would get 12 scallops for 15 guests...HMM...seems a bit unjust to me. However, there was still plenty of food to go around. For me, if I am paying a pre-fix price, I expect everyone to get the same amount, and not have to share...  I might have to say, besides the Pork Bell Bao, Lobster dish, and dessert, everything was just Meh.  Ordered: We practically almost sampled the entire menu! 1) Spicy Cucumbers - togarashi, toasted almond  - 3/5 good, but pretty simple 2) Crab Deviled Eggs - smoked trout roe, crispy bonito - 2/5 eh, wasn't my favorite dish.  3) Pork Belly - hoisin, scallion, cucumber  - 5/5 $7 for one bun, outrageous! Anyhow, this was my favorite dish of the night. The pork belly was SOO FATTY and well seasoned! 4) Beets - citrus, rye XO sauce  4/5 probably my favorite beet dish ever Market Greens - tomato, gooseberry, ricotta 3/5 good, but probably wouldn't order outside of prefix 5) Hokkaido Scallops - carrot, Anson Mills grains, tasso ham, tomato - 4/5 good, but would've been nice if we had our own scallop for the prefix menu. Steamed Whole Branzino - charred lemon,  brown butter dashi, herbs 3.5/5 good, but nothing special  6) Korean Braised Short Rib - root vegetables, chilies, sesame 2.5/5 way too salty... 7) Salt & Pepper Lobster- lobster and gulf shrimp battered and fried then heavily seasoned with fried garlic, scallions, and chilies 4/5 another delicious and well prepared plate.  8) Korean Braised Short Ribs- Boneless beef short ribs slow cooked with daikon, lotus root, potatoes, and rice cakes.  Topped with chilies, scallions, sesame and presented family style in a donabe with rice. 1/5 inedible ...way way way way too salty.... very sad I barely touched my bowl.  We went a bit crazy on the dessert: 1) Crack pie: 3/5  2) Birthday Cake: 4/5 I typically don't like birthday cake, but this was well made--not TOO sweet 3) Cereal Milk Soft Serve: 3.5/5 good if you're looking for something simple 4) Cinnaswirl soft serve: 3/5 Tasted like a churro--a bit too sweet for me 5) Candy Bar Pie: 3/5 I like the crack pie better if I had to pick",

    "text": "Had a reservation at Momofuku for July 4. Started with two shrimp steam buns (best buns I've ever had). The shrimp was a bit random, as it came as a pan-fried cake; still, I enjoyed it (my wife did not). We also had the Meatballs to share. I liked these quite a bit - tender and juicy.  For mains, I had the pork Ramen, and my wife had the chickpea Ramen. Mine came with pulled pork (very dry), a soft egg (delicious), pork belly (not bad). Overall, it was fine - however the actual Ramen broth just wasn't that flavourful. Considering we were told by the waiter that Momofuku Vegas is \"known for Ramen\" - which I have also heard before on Yelp - we were both very underwhelmed. Yusho in Monte Carlo (RIP) had much more delicately flavoured and balanced Ramen.   Having said all that, the restaurant has an amazing view, service was good and the drinks were all tasty. We may give it another chance next time.",

Momofuku Las Vegas is antithesis of all that, the synergy between the property chef Shaun and David's brand standards is awesome, it's obvious the staff respects their purpose immensely and it really speaks highly to the management team and culture. Food offerings were stellar. From the duck entree to the kimichi apple salad, the truffle @ prosciutto with frozen grapes it was stunning from app to dessert (white truffles and soft serve).

TLDR: pricey gourmet asian food at a trendy casual setting with excellent service  Ambiance: trendy, casual, a little loud Service: attentive, helpful, warm Food: not the best value but excellent food with the exception of shishito peppers.  - sweet and sour long beans (4.5 stars): fresh, tender, well flavored - uni hash (5 stars): our favorite, fresh uni works well with the fried hash - shishito pepper (1 star): would recommend avoiding. ITS SO SALTY we had to rinse it in water to eat some. All the yellow toppings on top are lime salt and they could almost kill my tastebuds  - grilled lamb ribs (5 stars): amazing, so tender and rich seasoning - black truffle ramen (4.5 stars): full of truffle fragrance, works well with the broth but a little salty for the bf",

Took a look at the menu and realized this would be a great place if I had friends (and more money), but nonetheless I was hopeful that the food would comfort me in my loneliness.   I decided to get two of the cheapest menu items, a pork bun and the vegetarian ramen. The food instilled a happiness in me that I did not think was possible. As I think about how good the cheapest items tasted, my mouth waters for the potential foodgasms await me from the menu.   I plan on returning one day once I get some friends. Otherwise, my one night in Momofuku is something I'll cherish forever.",

    "text": "I've never been disappointed with any of the Momofuku restaurants and I've always tried to go to at least one Momofuku whenever there is one in the city I visit. So of course I had to try this one at the Cosmopolitan while in Vegas. As with every restaurant of David's, they don't disappoint! The service as always was great. Servers were very well informed whenever we had any questions (and we had a couple). We had a pescatarian with us in our group and we had seen the shiitake mushroom bun on a yelp review so we asked to see if we could still order that so she could try the baos. We also ordered the chicken bowl and the ginger scallion noodles as well as the pork belly baos. There were 3 of us sharing all these things and we were so stuffed we hardly finished everything.   The pork belly baos were amazing as always. Just enough sauce to keep it all moist. Deliciously fatty pork belly that just melts in your mouth and a delicious soft bao to wrap it all up and soak up the juices!   The chicken bowl (I can't quite remember the name but it's not the jidori bowl with the poached egg) was super delicious! Super fragrant with the sesame oil. Deliciously roasted chicken and delicious pickled greens and wakame salad all topped with roasted sunflower seeds. I have to say that the toasted sunflower seeds were probably the best part of the bowl. With a hint of smokiness it really elevated the dish and made me keep going back for more. It did get a tiny bit too salty as I ate more of it but I do tend to like milder salt flavours.   The ginger scallion noodles. OMG. What delicious flavours! Such a non exciting sounding dish, but it was amazing! So much flavour packed into those noodles. The noodles itself were cooked to perfection and the toppings were just delightful. I think this was my favourite dish by far.  One in our group ordered the ramen, but she said she didn't really love it. I didn't get to try hers but noodle bar was amazing when I went to the one in Chicago.   So as with all Momofuku establishments, I always recommend! We did make reservations on open table but I don't think reservations are too hard to come by. Walk ins waits shouldn't be too bad as well as I didn't see all that many people waiting and while we were inside for 1:30pm lunch it wasn't completely packed but still quite full.",

While the food was wonderful, the prices were outrageous... so if you are looking to conserve your money, well, stay clear of this establishment (pic of menu and prices)   You can make reservations via Open Table, or the Momofuku website.   we had the pork belly buns, which were amazing. Sweet, and Spicy.  The shishito peppers were good, addictive :) they were not hot, but mild.   The ramen (Truffle Ramen) was wonderful...  the Rack of Lamb was awesome...   but  I would not recommend this place to anyone, unless you are willing to spend the $$$$ (yeah, I give it 4 $)...  Now visiting Las Vegas you should splurge, but this was a little excessive.   I tried it, I can say I did it... but doubt I will return.",

    "text": "Didn't get a chance to try Momofuku in New York, so I'm glad they have one in Vegas which is much closer to me. My boyfriend and I told them we were celebrating our anniversary, so the moment we sat down, they gave us 2 glasses of complimentary champagne. Great start. We still wanted to try their interesting cocktails, so we got the Bok to the Beat (made with bok choy) and 24k Magic (made with carrots). For food, we got...  Small Plates - A5 Hokkaido Wagyu Potatoes: O.M.G. this might be one of the best things I've ever consumed. The meat just melts in your mouth, while the potatoes were crispy with some honey mustard and garlic. It was divine.  Large Plates - Miso Black Cod: When I see black cod on the menu, I usually order it, and this did not disappoint. Served with shiitakes, bok choy, and daikon, which in my opinion, are the perfect sides.  Noodles & Buns - Ginger Scallion Noodles: This dish wasn't bad, it was just a little bit too salty. Otherwise, I would have enjoyed it more.  When we thought we were done, the server ended up giving us a complimentary confetti cookie from Milk Bar next door! 5 stars for service. Honestly, the only reason why I knocked down 1 star is the prices. It is ridiculously high for even a Vegas restaurant. Maybe because it only has 2 $$ on Yelp, when it really should be 3. The cheaper items here are the buns and secret menu ramen, but that doesn't interest me as much as their larger family style dishes. Although it's expensive, I will probably be back.",

It came with pork belly and shoulder, ramen noodle, slowed poached egg, and green onions. The noodle was soft and hot. The pork was soft and melts in your mouth. The poached egg have a bright golden yellow yolk. The pork was good. The dish overall was salty (which is typical for ramen dishes) due to the sodium.

The chickpeas were crispy and despite being deep fried, they kept the chickpea flavor.  If you like them soft, soak the chickpeas enough in the miso broth, and they do soften up.  The few bok choy were a nice touch.  They were fresh and crispy.    As for my thirsty friends, they too were happily satisfied because Momofuku has a full bar with some top shelf spirits, including high end tequila and scotch.  As for me, an IPA was the perfect pairing for my ramen.    Service was also great.  Super friendly, engaged and accommodating by serving us an extra drink after the bar closed. This Momofuku is of the same quality and coolness as the one DC which I am a big fan of as well.  Enjoy!",

    "text": "Been dying to try momofuku but New York is so far from the west coast so when I heard there was one in Las Vegas, it was a great excuse to take a trip for some great food and a little bit of gambling.   Ended up getting the Bo Ssam bowl, Shoyu pork ramen, and the pork belly buns. Everything tasted absolutely amazing, definitely lived up to the hype. Though I'm a ramen fanatic, I think the bo ssam bowl was my favorite. It's so flavorful and filling!   We also got the infamous birthday cake. To be honest, it wasn't as revolutionary as I was hoping, but it was still a pretty decent cake.   The service was also fantastic. I forget my waiter's name, but he was friendly, helpful, and was quick to refill waters. Can't wait to come back and try the rest of the menu",

I ordered the pork ramen. The pork belly portion that I got was phenomenal. It was crispy on the outside and deliciously rich and fatty.   Unfortunately, the dish was quite salty overall, which is not a complaint I usually have (I like more salt than the average person.) I probably wouldn't have said anything, but my friend ordered the salt and pepper lobster and it was so overly salty that she bought it up to the waiter. He was so friendly and took it off the bill, but it seems as if oversalting dishes was a systemic issue. I have had phenomenal ramen in the past, and for the price point and the lack of quality, I am not sure I would return to Momofuku.",

Long story short.. it was good, but not great.  I ended up ordering the ginger scallion noodles and pork belly buns. The pork belly was crispy and came with a delicious hoisin sauce - I think the buns are a must if you're going to hit up Momofuku. They provided a spicy sauce on the side as well. Noodles were tasty, but not a stand-out dish for me. For a beverage, I went with the only vodka cocktail on the menu (Summer Fling - vodka, watermelon, basil, cinchona). It was okay, a little strong for my taste.  I'd come back here if I had a group to go with - they have family style dishes that looked realllly good (I'm thinking about the salt & pepper lobster and shrimp specifically).   Service was really nice and attentive. Atmosphere was cool - doesn't look like much from the outside but they have a relatively large space and nice view of the strip.",

I was unfortunately not able to get the duck as the smaller portion is only for lunch, so I'll have to come back and get it! We ended up ordering the shishito peppers, pear and burrata salad, rice cakes, and whole fish. Everything was delicious!  The shishito peppers were spicy and the peanut or sesame on top was a good extra. The pear and burrata salad was my favorite, creamy and rich but still light. The rice cakes were crunchy yet chewy. The fish was a great amount for the price and tasted very fresh! Maybe a little too many garlic slices though.  The service was excellent. Our server was very friendly and helpful, giving us tastes of sake before we chose one (the house one is great, get it!) and a spicy cucumber on the house (also great with peanuts and spicy seasoning).  Definitely will be back!!",

Sat at the bar and was assisted by Bree who was very helpful & pleasant. She even informed me that I could get one pork bun  (the dish typically comes with two) so I really appreciated the insider tip. The pork bun was perfectly crispy & the sauce really added to the dish. Would highly recommend. I was in the mood for a light lunch after a fairly gluttonous 2 days on Vegas. Opted for the little gem salad with spicy shrimp. It was excellent & full of interesting flavors. I would also highly recommend this dish - it is plenty to share between 2 people as a starter. Overall I thoroughly enjoyed my experience & will be back to sample more items!",

Thanks to OpenTable's reservation of course.   5 of us got the Momofuku Ramen and the other two got the chilled spicy noodle. They ran out of pork belly but they gave us extra pork shoulder, which was unbelievably tender and juicy.   We also got the oysters which were really fresh and tasty. I wish we had a little bit of Tabasco sauce though.   Definitely would recommend going here for lunch if you're not in a mood for a buffet in Vegas! Pretty affordable considering the prices around the strip. I'm definitely coming back to try the large plate family meals.",

That's kinda what the entrance is like - the Cosmopolitan is a bizzarro Disney packed with mid-20s in various stages of drunkenness, but once you get inside, you appreciate that, beyond the loud, hip, club beats are really high quality staff and servers in a really well decorated space. A David Choe mural adorns the \"accent wall\" of the restaurant, giving it space an edgy look that otherwise may be steakhouse decor.  Dining experience here is best with a group... with a certain immunity to sticker shock. It's not that the food is undeserving... it is really worth what you pay for it. The lobster tails and the duck were highlights that are worth coming back for.",

Apparently, they charge for water which they did not clarify prior to pouring it or at the time of seating. I get that it's $1 per person, but we weren't informed of this charge nor was offered house water, which we would have gladly drank.  The pork belly buns that people are raved about are no where near decent. The fat wasn't fully rendered and the one I got only had sauce on half of the bun (not top or bottom but sides). The pork belly got a nice crunch to it but lacks flavor.  The pork belly ramen tastes horrible as well. Low quality ramen along with low end soup base. We got a pre-made poached egg (cold center) along with the same flavor-lacking pork belly. The shredded pork was okay but still not amazing. I rather eat instant noodle at this point if you look at the price.  I understand things can be pricey at a tourist location, but this was just a horrible experience that if I could have given it a negative star I would have. Came here because how well known NY Momofuku is, but this is a huge disappointment of the brand name.",

    "text": "I came here for a last lunch before I left Vegas and I am so glad I did!  We had a reservation for 7 at 1130 on a Sunday, and we got there when they weren't too busy and had great service.  We split a few appetizers including the crispy potatoes, sweet and sour long beans (very good) and my personal favorite, the the spicy cucumbers!! After several days of eating terrible food and eating excessively, the spicy cucumbers were so fresh and delicious it helped me feel a little bit better about myself.  If they had sold the sauce they put on their cucumbers, I would have bought a bottle on the spot.   For my main, I wanted to try the black truffle ramen I saw recommended all over yelp, but it wasn't available.  I went with the pork ramen instead and it was so perfect.  It wasn't too salty, it had a lot of flavor, and it was nice and warm and helped me feel better about my hangover before I flew home.  It's been a week now, and I live in Minnesota, and I would love nothing more than a hot bowl of their ramen to show up in my arms as I sit here and wait out the snowiest February in our history.    If I was in Vegas again, I'd try to come back here for my last meal to eat that ramen and cucumbers again.",

What I like about Momofuku is that it has variety in the menu. They have fancy food when you feel like it, but also have basic simple food when you don't feel like going for fancy. My go-to menu is the 5-spice duck ssam. I feel like it's very fulfilling because it has the duck, rice, lettuce, and also the pancakes. It's like an all-in-one dish. I also like to get the pork belly buns fir appetizer.",

The big eye tune with shaved Foie gras and strawberry's was very good and super interesting. The pork bun and shrimp bun was a little bland. The pork shoulder was ok. Had the crack pie which we were looking forward to the most and sadly disappointed. It was really sweet and just one note of flavor. Servers where nice and view of strip cool. I might eventually give it another try but a lot of restaurants still on my list in Vegas.",

Had the pork belly buns... ginger scallion noodles and the black cod.  We don't like sweet food, and the black cod is kinda sweet, which is the way it's supposed to be prepared... so our fault.  All else was super.  We even were intrigued by something one of the cooks was making and he saw me looking... and he gave us a free sample.  HUGE.",

    "text": "Definetely a different vibe from the NY location, but the food is on point!  Highlights were:  1. Wagyua Tri-Tip: perfectly cooked and seasoned. No complaints here, though I didn't eat it as a wrap!  2. Chilled spicy noodles: perfect blend of flavors and just enough of a kick to make you go back for more. We demolished this plate. 3. Cauliflower and Brussel Sprout: a great side dish, full of flavor. A little salty when eating towards the bottom bc of the sauce. 4. Pork belly bun: just a good piece of pork belly and the bun is soft and delicious. Definitely recommend.  Lowlights: 1. The duck: i was most excited for this dish. I have duck pretty much anywhere that offers it. The duck itself was tougher than usual (even considering duck is usually tough) and the skin wasn't nearly as crispy as I'd like. The portion was ok, but for nearly $50 it was not worth the cost. We left about half on the plate because it left a bad taste in our mouths. They do put shredded duck on the same dish so that was Ok, but obviously not what you're paying a premium for.   Honestly the overall experience was pretty good, and I'd recommend the restaurant generally, just wasn't too pleased with the duck which I was most excited about.  Stay Cheerful ;)",

    "text": "I know I'll have the unpopular opinion here, but the food here did not stand out to me in any way. Here are the pros and cons:   The duck confit fried rice was too salty and doesn't work as an entree - it makes more sense as a side. It was too much overstated rice and even saltier duck (which is fine, duck should be salted, but it's not that great along salty rice too). Too expensive for a $30+ entree. I don't mind paying a lot for good food, but trust me when I say this was not worth $30.   The ramen was ok. It features the same pork belly you can get from the pork belly buns. The pork belly was dry and tough, not something that melts-in-your-mouth in the way pork belly is meant.   The noodles were expertly cooked and had wondering texture. However the broth was one dimensional. Definitely did not live up to the hype or the $17 price tag.   Service was good, although the table next to us was seated after us and got their food before us. We ordered the pork buns as appetizers  but they came LAST after the fried rice and the ramen. The purified water tastes crisp (worth the $1 charge) and the drink I got was well made. However the food is forgettable and overpriced/overhyped. It feels like something I'd get at a boba cafe, for $12-$15.  It's not a place worth the wait or the price tag in my opinion.",

I've eaten at a variety of Momofuku's in NYC and had good experiences and delicious food there, so I was expecting the same here.  The restaurant is located next to Milk Bar and definitely more blingy compared to it's NYC counterparts. Boyfriend and I sat at the bar with a full view of the kitchen, and we watched them crank out dish after dish. We had the pork ramen, pork buns, and spicy rice cakes (with pork). Are you sensing a porky theme here?!  I know it's Vegas, and it's expected you pay a premium for everything here, but the price point even exceeded NYC, which seemed crazy to us. The ramen was just ok and the broth didn't have the richness we were expecting. For some reason, it didn't taste the same as the Noodle Bar version, and the portion size seemed smaller.   The other issue I had was with the pork buns. Please see photos for a side-by-side comparison of NYC Momofuku buns vs. the ones at this location. The pork buns here were incredibly piddly and the amount of pork belly was literally half of what it should be. Definitely not a consistent experience.",

I had a nice lunch at Momofuku and enjoyed its extended dining area that cant be seem from the front enterance. The decor was sleek and sophisticated with a lot of natural lighting. I had lunch here to catch up with a friend and we both had a very nice time.  I ordered the the pork belly buns, cold spicy noodles, and the fried Brussels sprouts. The pork belly buns were tender and delicious but it was different from NYC. It was lightly fried on the sides to make it crispy whereas in New York, it was sliced and served super delicate and fatty. Even though they were different, I enjoyed both preparations.  I thought the fried brussels sprouts were good but it was drenched in sauce. After eating half, the rest were soggy and swimming in Asian flavored sauce. I will ask for the sauce on the side next time. The spicy noodles had great flavor from the pork sausage but it was way too spicy for me. I will probably not order that again but it would be great for people that love heat.  Overall, I would come back here because of the ambiance and the pork belly buns.",

The ginger scallion noodles were initially fine, tasty, and not overpowering. But as I dug deeper into the bowl there was a pool of oil at the bottom that was very off-putting. With each bite I could feel the oiliness becoming more and more prominent. The actual noodles were cooked fine and the flavor was light, but the oil brought everything down. The spicy chicken sandwich was okay, but unforgettable. I probably would not return to this restaurant as there are a lot of other choices in Vegas.",

    "text": "Wow, wife and I REALLY enjoyed our visit here, the food is   good. I'd say the hype is real, for the most part. We just about had a feast, and sure did leave satisfied!  Started with Shishito peppers. Butt simple, Grilled and sprinkled with smoked salt.   Next were two \"buns\", one shrimp and the other Shiitake mushroom. These were fantastic. I was a little put off when they appeared because they don't look like Asian style steamed buns, but rather like a taco. Deconstruction aside, the fillings were so good, the Shiitake bun was pretty simple, sauteed mushrooms/scallions/ cucumber. Good meat like flavor and texture addictive savor that I spent zero time thinking about because it was so good. The shrimp bun was its equal, and sort of had a St. Paul sandwich kind of consistency and flavor. It was actually a shrimp cake, instead of individual shrimp, Not sure if \"deep\" or \"pan\" but it was fried. A little spicy, a little mayo, some pickled red onion/ shredded lettuce....I'm telling you, very St. Paul sandwich like.  Next up were cold Sichuan noodles. Loved them. Wheat noodles, with a pesto kind of sauce with Sichuan sausage basil and candied cashews. I sort of expected this to be sweeter than it actually was from the Cashews but really not so. The one mild let down was the chicken which was a little dry, and really could have benefited from some kind of condiment or dipping sauce kind of thing. I'll have to take one star for that, but all in all we really enjoyed our meal here!",

The skin on the chicken was way different from what I'm used to. It was light and airy, while still being super crispy. Refreshingly different from other karage I've had.   2. Pork Belly Ramen - OKAY. 3/5 stars. I've had a lot of good ramen in my life....this was decently good but not the best I've ever had. Probably still one of the better ramen options in vegas though.   Service was excellent.",

My girlfriend and I like to consider ourselves ramen connoisseurs and thus we have high expectations when it comes to broth and noods.  We both ordered the chickpea ramen and added shiitake mushrooms to it. The mushrooms were OUT OF THIS WORLD. The noodles were fresh and encompassed the perfect amount of chew. The broth was light yet flavorful. However, beware chickpeas can make one rather gaseous...so make sure you're comfortable with your significant other if you choose to take them there.

    "text": "Momofuku is finally here and I could not be anymore excited. Reservation was set for 8:30pm checked in and the girls up front were very nice and professional. Told us our table would be ready shortly. As we waited we grabbed a quick drink at the bar.  I had the Suntory Highball, definitely different with a very subtle taste. My friend had another specialty drink that was very tasty, I just cannot recall the name.   Our table was ready and we were greeted by our server Tao who did a phenomenal job in taking care of us. He explained the menu in very brief detail and gave us a few minutes to look over it.   Starters, we had their Momofuky Oysters. I did not have any as I am not a fan of oysters but by the way they killed those oysters my best bet was that they were delicious.  Brussels sprouts were cooked perfectly. Crunchy on the outside and nice and soft in the inside.  Then we had the Pork ramen which I loved. The piece of pork that came with it literally melted as you took a bite. It was my favorite thing in the ramen, I just wished there was more. Good flavor overall and the noodles were cooked perfectly.   For the main entree we had the Bo Ssam. Slow-roasted cooked pork shoulder. Yeezus was this freaking amazing. The pork was beyond tender. The meat would fall apart as you would dig your utensils in it. Very rich in flavor and color. It was served with white rice, kimchee, lettuce and sauces. Best thing we had that night... (mouth waters).   Dessert time, or as I call it my favorite part. We had the Chocolate chocolate cookie and the Blueberry + cream. Both were very good just wished they had more of a chew to them. And of course we had to try the self serve milk cereal. It was served in a mug topped with cereal and a little bit of chocolate drizzle. This dessert was really weird to me as it actually tasted like the left over milk from your cereal bowl. Definitely a must try as it was unique and delicious at the same time.   Thank you Neil for setting up our reservation and taking real good care of us. Momofuku is for sure going to be a huge hit here for all the locals and tourist in Vegas.",

    "text": "Located inside The Cosmopolitan, which for the time being still offers free parking.  I came with a co-resident to celebrate the end of our month of night float together. We made a reservation for two for Wednesday at 6:30PM about a week before dining. The restaurant is actually fairly spacious inside (though it doesn't look so from the entrance), but given the popularity, I would probably recommend making a reservation or else be prepared for a long wait. The interior is gorgeous and very sleek/modern. This restaurant is still only a few months old, after all.  Our server checked on us regularly and explained a lot to us. He was friendly but then we overheard him make an almost identical spiel to a neighboring table, so it felt somewhat scripted.   The menu is not too large, and there are some very tasty looking \"large format\" meals on the backside good for larger groups. Things can get very pricey, but there are also more moderately priced and filling dishes such as ramen.  My co-resident and I decided to splurge and share a bunch of dishes, including three desserts. We ended up spending about $90 each, though you definitely easily could have spent both more or less, depending on what you ordered.  My yuzu lemonade was sweet and fragrant, but definitely not sour enough for me for a lemonade, and it was not a very big glass for $8 (plus had a good amount of ice).  The \"bao\" were tasty, though to be honest, I picture a closed circular bun when I hear the word \"bao,\" not the open faced kind that these are. Sure, the buns as served here are a type of bao, but I would not default to this type with the word bao alone (but I'm biased by Chinese usage).  The steamed whole branzino was the winner of the night, with extremely tender meat. Although it was described as steamed, it was probably steamed to cook but then pan-seared to finish.   Overall, the food is tasty, but I would describe it as Asian-inspired more than Asian fusion, as the dishes still felt primarily western.  The desserts were tasty too and from Milk Bar next door, though many items were a bit sweet for my tastes.    Overall, I can see what all the hubbub is all about, and I would definitely recommend trying Momofuku out; now you don't have to travel to the East Coast to do so!",

    "text": "I'll admit, I was one of those who saw this restaurant as a \"must-try\" like most people after watching Ugly Delicious / Chef's Table on Netflix. I've been to Majordomo twice and once I took off my rose-colored glasses the second time, I was severely disappointed by the experience. But I wouldn't be doing my due diligence if I didn't try his other restaurant.  To put it short, the food in general was extremely over-salted and relied so heavily on fish sauce. I don't believe the cooks know how to use fish sauce properly as some of the food was practically inedible. The service wasn't great either, and it was similar to what we had experienced at Majordomo...waiters were waiting around by the bar/kitchen and it took forever to get any service (The manager was nice however...something needs to be done with some of the servers. They were basically getting free money by doing nothing). The restaurant wasn't even busy. We even got charged $1 / person for tap water...which is something I've never encountered...even in peak drought periods in Los Angeles. All in all, more ugly than delicious.  + BRUSSELS SPROUTS AND CAULIFOWER - This was one of those dishes that was poorly done...primarily cause the cook did not know how to use fish sauce properly. After each bite, I had to drink water to wash it down. We had to send this one back.  + KALBI WAGYU TRI-TIP - The meat was tough and the dish wasn't particularly amazing  + GRILLED ASPARAGUS - The best dish of the night. Primarily since i've never had asparagus as juicy as this.  + PORK BELLY BUNS - To their credit, the pork belly was cooked well..melted in your mouth. Other than that...pretty unspectacular for that $7 price tag. I'd recommend finding a place in San Gabriel Valley for a lot cheaper.  + CHILLED SPICY NOODLES - Good texture on the noodles and good level of flavor.  All in all, not worth the hype. I'd recommend going elsewhere in Vegas (but definitely stop by for Milk Bar).",

    "text": "I'm not sure what happened to my last review when I first came here in April.  It somehow vanished, or maybe I wrote a draft and it disappeared?  Anyway, my visit in April was terrible.  I sat at the bar that went right along the kitchen.  The service was subpar that visit.  I was also recommended a rice dish that I didn't particularly enjoy.  I don't remember what kind of chicken on a bed of rice type of dish it was, but the rice to chicken ratio just wasn't to my liking.  Overall, I felt like I was ignored and nobody really came and checked on me.  I clearly remembered these two hot girls sitting perpendicularly adjacent to me (I was at the end of the bar) at the bar and obviously they got tons of attention from the wait staff but who can blame them.  I had ordered an iced tea and I might have had one refill the entire night and that was after I had to call somebody over.  I heard too many good reviews that I had to try this place again.  Yet again, I sat at the bar again because I was by myself.  I ordered the pork belly bun and it was still amazing.  This time, I ordered the pork ramen which was off the menu.  The menu only had 2 cold noodle dishes listed but luckily my waitress said that the ramen did exist and the girl that sat next to me also had ordered it. The components in the ramen were awesome, there was shredded pork, some veggies, a couple of soft boiled/poached eggs, and a wonderfully cooked piece of pork belly.  The pork belly had great texture to it.  The broth was amazing, the ramen were cooked to perfection.  I demolished that bowl of noodles like nobody's business. This time around, the wait staff was much more attentive.  I got my water refilled a bunch of times, my waitress came and checked in on me.  It was also fun talking to the chefs and asking what they were making and cooking back there.    I'm glad I gave Momofuku another chance.  I was bitter and angry at what happened at my first visit, but they made up for it this visit.",

    "text": "A great solid choice with a great view.  We have a Momofuku in DC closer to home, but this one was the only one that really caught our eye and made us want to go in. Besides, it's in Vegas. Splurge a little. We went on an off time because we just checked in and we were hungry.  The place is well kept and stylish. The servers were all cheerful and helpful. We had no clue what to get, but in the end, we were able to get the dishes we were looking for. We ordered the pork ramen with their gochujang sauce and some chili oil. I ordered the salmon sandwich.  The salmon sandwich was pretty good. It would benefit with more flavor in the sauce as the salmon flavor overpowered the whole dish. Besides that, the ramen tasted fresh and there were no complaints on that end. Thus, it may be the dish that I ordered, but it was still a well cooked piece of salmon.   We did had the cucumber as starters and it reminded us of the Din Tai Fung cucumber appetizer in Taiwan... Just with pistachios or peanuts. It was a memorable dish in Taiwan so when we tasted this version, we instantly thought about the one in Taiwan.   The decor was awesome with a high ceiling. The view over the strip was beautiful. Don't think they needed lights as the light from the windows was enough. Kind of wished we came here for dinner to see how the lighting affected the ambiance. When we peered in at night, it looked cool.   For the price point and the service we received, I would say it doesn't get any better than this. We definitely spend more than what we spent here in Vegas and came out less satisfied. Thus, this place deserves 5 stars in my book.",

We got there and there was no wait unlike other really good restaurants on the strip. We got the roasted potatoes and string beans as appetizers and everyone got a bowl of the Shoyu Ramen.  The appetizers were good; however, I was definately not a fan of the ramen.  It was wayyy too salty.  I usually get tonkotsu when it comes to ramen but they only offered either shoyu or chickpea. The porkbelly was good but the shredded pork they put in it is kinda weird and bland.  Their poached egg was way too raw for me.  Overall I just didnt like it at all, and for the price? I wouldnt go again.",

The service was a little slow to get a drink. But the food is really good! My friend and I shared the Salmon - and I would definitely NOT recommend the Salmon...unless you're a die hard salmon fan. Anyway - the drinks were awesome and the appetizers were key. Don't Skip out on the Pork Buns. That's worth coming to this place alone!  The bathroom was kind of a joke because they only had 1 toilet for girls and 1 for boys and it was a bidet! So it took forever just to use the bathroom because I'm sure everyone was enjoying their sweet time on the bidet....I mean... If I wasn't headed to a show later, and I had the time, I may have enjoyed it myself.  Anyway - Come here because #1 it's in the Cosmo. #2 The Pork Buns ('nuff said) #3 The Cake balls. I don't do dessert - but I will do some delicious cake balls.   Also - there were people here in fancy clothes all the way to swimsuit cover ups. So I don't really think there's a dress code.",

I asked for some recommendations from her and went with the spicy cucumber salad and the lamb ribs. The salad was fresh, crunchy and refreshing, different in a good way. The lamb ribs were one of the best dishes I've ever tried. The meat was so tender it just slid right off the bone. The spicy yogurt sauce wasn't very spicy at all and really added to the taste of the meat. The portion was a nice size, certainly big enough for an entree in my opinion. The service was super speedy. I always had refills and the food came out really fast. Last but not least, I couldn't pass up the birthday cake. Amazing. Just get it. It's big enough for 2 people so don't let the $14 scare you. It's massive. I cannot wait to come back here.",

After further inspecting the menu I realized that most items on the menu were a little pricey, but I decided to stay and go with original plan and get some buns and spicy cucumbers.   I ordered an old fashioned, perfectly crafted and delicious. The bartender was super friendly.  The bar manager walks over and asks if I have any allergies and then hands me spicy cucumbers on the house. Mind readers?! I then instead ordered the smoked mussels and what a good decision it was. The smoked flavor was mind blowing. Will definitely be coming back here next time in Vegas!",

Both were good, but not anything to write home about unfortunately.  The venue was really large, so we didn't have a wait (though we did also get there really early for lunch). The food came out fairly quickly and the restaurant was super accommodating to one of our party who was in a rush since she was heading to the airport immediately after.  The shrimp bao was okay. It comes out in patty form, but has a good chunkiness to it so you know it's really shrimp. Unfortunately, it was a bit under flavored. The ramen was also good, but not what I was hoping for. I love a great, creamy, pork tonkatsu. However, the type of soup they use here is not creamy, just broth. I tried to mix the poached egg in there to give it some creaminess which made it better. The gochujang sauce is a must and makes it so much better.",

The place was packed and they had hip hop dance music playing kind of in the style of the Roots.   Ambienc e is like that of a lively bar.  Noise level is above average.  Service was quick and precise.  Just a note if you want ramen it's not on the men so ask for the options.  We ordered the  -White Sturgeon Caviar Bun $32 -Pork Belly Bun $7 -Truffle Ramen $50 -Chilled Spicy noodles $16 -Crack pie $6.50  They all tasted great.  If you like truffles I'd definitely recommend the ramen.  Also note they don't serve the egg soft boiled, it is dropped in easy Sunny side up.  Some of the stuff is a little pricey, so the unaqauinted may have sticker shock on some of the menu items.  All in all nothing I can complain about, good service, great food I liked the music.

    "text": "Came here because I am a huge David Chang fan. However, I have not tried his amazing food before. Finally, the time has happened, and I got to try out Momofuku. We had a party of 4, my friend, her husband, my fiance and me.   Ok, just to let anyone know that they do not take walk-in if you are going to dine there. The part of the restaurant that does take walk-in in the bar area. Where they have a smaller set menu. Since my friend couldn't get a reservation at an earlier time we had no choice but did the walk-in bar, and by the way... there is at least about a 40 min wait for seating, and this was at 5:00 pm.   The pricing... It is very expensive. I don't know if Momofuku is considered fine dining because where we were at (the bar), I would not consider it fine dining. So... if you are a David Chang fan, please note you will need to save money to eat here. On that note of money... They do charge $1 for their 7 filtered water on your receipt; however, it is all you can drink for the water. The water itself is DAMN GOOD, and since they are charging you $1 for water (where you can find it else for free) drink all the water you can get.    Decor/Cleanliness I didn't get to see the inside of the restaurant since I was at the bar area. So I'll tell you what the dining experience is like there. The bar area looks like a hip bar with Korean/Japanese inspiration for the decor. Honestly... it made me feel like I was dining in a small Japanese noodle house. The place is immaculate! So don't worry about dirty or sticky surfaces cause they got you covered.    Food Grilled Lamb Ribs (Cucumber, chili yogurt) - Hell to the yes, so good! So tender and pulls off the bone so easily. Get that of all things.  Whole Jidori Chichen (curry, lime, Kimchi) - It's good, however... not my favorite thing that we ordered. Their kimchi is on the side, so you don't need to worry about kimchi in the chicken. The skin is very good and flavorful.  Ginger Scallion Noodles (pickled shiitake, cucumber, wakame) - Yes, cause you need some carbs in your meal! Crack pie (Milkbar) - YUM! $6 Just get it.  Birthday Cake (Milkbar) - Damn it's good. For $14 a slice.... I know how labor intensive this particular slice of cake is and I would say yes get it.   Service Excellent service, although I have to say they can work on their refill drinks for anything other than their delicious water. For their drink service for water, OMG! They are all about it! Your glass will get filled before it hits the bottom. I got the ice tea, and they were not really up to par on that service. However, everything else was wonderful! Their servers were very professional and helpful. The food will come out on time, and their staff does work well as a team, so you have to be impressed regarding that.   Overall Experience  4.5 Stars! Rounding up 5 Stars. My only gripe is the price. For the amount they charge, it's a lot! Including it's not a lot of food. It is the correct portion amount, where you are not disgustingly over stuff. You are not 100% full nor 90% full. You are mostly about 75% full. We could have ordered more, but for what reason? To burn a hole in your wallet? However.... I do value David Chang's efforts of his creation, the location of his restaurant and also staffing the chefs and the team; and I hope he is paying them fairly. Therefore... I'll stop griping about the cost for the meal and the experience. The food is excellent, the service was wonderful, and the decor will take you out of your usual surroundings. My recommendation are... bring people who like to eat, don't bring your kids... it's probably wasted on them, and they are better off eating something cheaper. A perfect place to impress a date, have an excellent meal with your adult friends and family members.   Happy Eating Everybody!",

    "text": "Had a great time at Momofuku Vegas. I had heard about this restaurant on one of the Ringer Podcast Network podcasts (either Bill Simmons or House of Carbs) and drug the family, Mom, Dad, two boys 13 & 11, down to the Cosmo to try it out.  The food was great. We tried three apps- cucumbers/crispy potatoes/peppers. The family loved the Crispy Potatoes and Spicy Cucumbers, but the Shishito Peppers were my favorite (could have been spicier).  Then we ordered three bowls and 2 orders of the pork buns. The pork buns were great, as expected (I've never had a bad pork bun) Bo Ssam Bowl, Ginger Scallion Noodles, and Shoyu Pork Ramen bowls were also very good. We passed them around, and everyone had their favorites. We were stuffed.  The service is tricky to review. Our waiter was adequate, but not terribly attentive. I would have dropped this review to 3 stars, had it not been for our seating location and our interaction with the back of the house staff.  If you can swing it, get a seat at the bar facing into the kitchen. The the food prep was not only fun to watch, but Zach was like our personal chef- answering all of our questions about the menu, the dishes we ordered and were eating. He told us some of the Chang story and generally made the meal. He inquired about our background and made us feel like we were the only ones in the restaurant.  Thanks again, Zach!  @ringer @thehouseofcarbs @momofukulasvegas",

Well my overplanning screwed me over because we arrived one day earlier than our actual reservation ! Thankfully, the staff at the hostess stand were very sweet and able to get us in that evening. I would still recommend making a reservation as this is one of the hot dining spots at the Cosmopolitan. Just verify date and time before you arrive. ;)  On to the food--- the menu is simple . I browsed and read reviews in advance so I would have an idea of what to expect. Our server suggested the V&S cocktail which was a mix of vodka, soda , and lemon verbena. It was a bit too tart and bitter for my taste . And $15 ! But to be expected.  We ordered a few appetizers to start-- the spicy cucumber was crunchy , spicy and nutty . I ordered the Shitake Bun (one bun per order) and it was substantial and flavorful. My husband had the Chicken Karaage one which was actually recommended by our server and he seemed to enjoy!  For our entrees, I had the Chickpea Ramen which I was so excited to try! It was nice to have a vegetarian option where they thought of everything including the broth. Most places don't go to that length. The chickpeas were crispy with a nice bite to them and there were ample pieces of bok Choy (my favorite!!!)  . The dish was so delicious and filling. My husband ordered the Smoked Pork Chops. Thankfully he enjoyed (it's a steep $36). They presented it sliced on a plate so all you have to do is eat! Lol.   They offer dessert from Milk Bar next door but we decided to walk over instead.     Overall, great dining experience. The restaurant is hip with a cool mural on the wall as a backdrop. Music is a tad louder than I would like (yes I sound like that person) . Especially when the server has to yell across the music lol.   Great asian option while in Vegas and yay for plenty of vegetarian options!",

    "text": "Located on the second floor right next to Milk at Cosmopolitan Hotel. I've always wanted to try this place but never had the time to the last time I was in New York. I was excited to see this place open up in Las Vegas.   Sad to say, I was disappointed by the taste and price. We ordered one Pork Bao Bun ($7) and two Pork Ramens ($18 each). Overall, the presentation was well-done. The Pork Bao Bun was delicious (only reason why I gave this place a 3-star, not 2). The bun was soft and warm. The oyster sauce and the gochujang sauce made it savory and sweet. The pork was soft and had a charred, smoky taste to it. However, the ramen was definitely not worth it. Personally, I prefer a thick tonkatsu soup when it comes to ramen. The Momofuku soup was too light and did not have a lot of depth/flavor. The soup was sweet, not savory. I wish there was a little kick/spice to it. I think that would've made it better but didn't want to pay extra $1 for chili oil. It was also weird that they put shredded chicken in the soup. I felt like it didn't really go well with the ramen and the pork. However, the portion was pretty big even though it was pricy.   We were looking for a good hangover soup, but this place wasn't the right choice for us.  For the same price or with a little more, I feel like you can get something way better. I personally would opt out for a brunch buffet next time.",

    "text": "I love David Chang and milk bar so I was really excited to visit Momofuku in Vegas. I had the ginger scallion noodles with an egg which was delicious. The pickled mushrooms were so flavorful. I also had the pork belly bun which did not disappoint. The Korean Saam sauce is so tasty!  The service was good but the server was cold and not friendly or personable. I was here for work and dined alone at the bar and he seemed annoyed that I didn't order any drinks. I asked for water and received the filtered tap water that they give everyone. When I got my bill, I noticed they charged me $1 for water. It was such a tacky touch to what would have been an otherwise fantastic meal. A little disappointed overall with the service and silly extra charge. It's only $1 I know, but it left a bad taste.",

Tried the Hamachi with ponzu and the spicy cold noodle dish. I like things spicy and it delivered. The noodles were yummy and had the perfect chewiness-- there were a lot of flavors going on--with the sweet crunchy nuts, very savory meat, and pickled spicy pepper slices, all in some kind of pesto like sauce.    Of course finished it off with some 'crack pie' to go.   Buttery goodness.    Best to come with a few folks as dinner serves many and you can try more dishes!!",

I believe customer service n satisfaction is high on the priority list when running a business like a restaurant..whether it's the food or bad service. Anyways.. After talking to Victor he made things better which says alot about the restaurant and how it's ran. I will definitely be back and dine with momofuku again..i just won't get the truffle ramen;)",

Mostly my fault for not saying anything and getting a better table . That being said, request to be by the windows as their is a nice view .  The service was very good water was always kept full and our server was informative .  The food is not like the pictures and lacked the spice and heat we expected .  The spicy cucumber salad was chunk like and not spicy at all . It was good just no spice . Honey crisp apple kimchi salad was a delicious combination of flavors .   Short rib stew , it's was plenty for 2 people and was very good . Again missing the spice and heat .  Crack pie ala mode for desert was pretty awesome the milk style ice cream is freakin awesome . And the pie is rich .  Honestly once I had the crampt shitty seat I was already not happy so it made the rest of the experience an uphill battle .  The food was good just missing flavor . They can do much better for the price .",

    "text": "The Weekend of Craziness!  I've always wanted to try Momofuku and finally had a chance when my husband and I threw our joint-bachelor/bachelorette party out in Vegas.  For our \"fancy\" meal, we picked Momofuku  because they were awesome to let us reserve our large party via OpenTable without having to put down our credit card number (I don't know what that annoys me...).  Anyway, since we had a party of 18, the server was really awesome in recommending an on-the-fly prefix menu for our table.  Supposedly, we got the best of Momofuku for $70/person.    I'll just go ahead and tell you my favorite: crispy chicken with caviar.  That chicken was crispy on the outside and salted just right.  The meat itself was tender and juicy.  The only complaint I had was that this dish came out towards the end when I was stuffed with all the other dishes that came before it.  The caviar definitely gave it a nice touch.    The other memorable item I tried there was the seasoned cucumbers.  I don't remember the exact name, but it's a cold appetizer dish.  That was surprisingly very memorable not to just myself, but my sister as well.    Overall, we had a great dinner.  Service was great, especially for such a large party, and we all had a wonderful time.",

    "text": "Ahhh the restaurant that sparked my \"LETS GO TO VEGAS!\" mode and had me convincing my boyfriend to take me on a weekend trip (it worked.)  I've been a fan of David Chang foreverrrr (he is listed as my \"current crush\" on Yelp, lol) never got to visit any of his restaurants before this one so I was stoked. Tried to make reservations, but there weren't any available so we tried our luck at a walk-in around 8pm on Saturday 2/18 and we were seated almost immediately.   Lucky us, we sat right there at the ramen bar where we could watch the chefs! My god, you should have seen my face light up that's exactly where I wanted to sit.   FOOOOOOD:   Spicy cucumbers - yummmmm, mixed together with macadamia nuts and avocado these spicy cucumbers were really good. even my avocado hating guy liked these.   Pickled vegetables - we barely made a dent in this. liked the kimchi a lot, radish didn't seem very pickle-y, melon was my least favorite. should have ordered more cucumbers.   Pork belly buns - typical bao, nothing too special about these. they had a bit too much hoisin and the pork was not crispy like I wanted it to be, had a fatty texture. could have used more cucumbers in here too.   Pork chop small plate - given to us by the chef handling meat. omg, amazing. tender to the point it just melted in your mouth. we seriously wanted to drink the sauce it was served in but kept it classy.   Bo Ssam - we were going to order this as both of our entrees with their large scale dining menu, but glad we didn't as I believe this as a whole meal would be too rich for me. Very flavorful and sweet with a bit a spice and falling apart. glad we got to try it, but not my favorite thing I had.   Black winter truffle ramen - My goodness I didn't think I could have a truffle overload, but this nearly did it. I felt I smelled of truffle for the rest of the night lol, but no complaints at all I loved my bowl of creamy ramen. Noodle were the exact texture I look for, they had a nice chewy bite that made me want to keep eating even though I was super full.   ***** STEAMED WHOLE BRANZINO - best piece of fish I have ever had. tied for best dish I had in Vegas and I do not like cooked fish. the brown butter dashi sauce that came along with the beautiful branzino was amazing. another sauce we wanted to lick from the plate. we were most impressed with this dish, I was so glad the bf ordered it.  Our server was adorable. Bubbly and attentive.  Next time will definitely order the momofuku oysters that I somehow overlooked.",

    "text": "Let me tell you. I've seen so much press on this place and it is well deserved. This is the best restaurant I've never eaten in. The service is impeccable. The food is magical.   Start off with a pork belly bao. You just have to. I don't care if you hate pork. Just put it in your mouth and chew and watch the flavors do the tango on your tongue.   Honorable mentions: The mussels: I have no idea how they get so much flavor into those things The brussel sprouts: who thought fish sauce and bacon go together Lamb ribs: so tender. Great yogurt sauce. Genius to add cucumbers as a garnish   After you finish go to MILK. Complete your culinary destiny. All hail David Chang!  UPDATE:  Came again for my mom's birthday this weekend and let me tell you, it was wonderful as ever. The staff is so accommodating and helpful. They really made my mom's birthday special. I tried the slow roasted peel family meal and it was perfect for us. As an Asian person, it's so nostalgic to convene and share a meal family style.   While all the food was wonderful, there was two that were in a league of their own. The salmon and the tuna tartare.   The salmon was so perfectly cooked I was blown away by the delicate kiss of smoke and the prefect medium rare. The accompaniment was perfect; I never knew sunflower seeds could be cooked in such an innovative way.   Let me tell you about this tuna. I have never had such a robust tuna. The texture and freshness of the fish was impeccable. And the fois gras shaved on top added such a delicate smokiness and richness to an already perfect dish.   Compliments to the chef, the servers, and the management. THIS IS THE BEST RESTAURANT I'VE EVER BEEN TO.",

    "text": "We were really excited to come to one of David Chang's restaurants. I personally didn't believe the hype after seeing his pompous tv show, so we came to see what it's worth. In short, it was pretty disappointing, but the service was spectacular.   On first site, the restaurant looks pretty small - kind of like a small dine in you see at Vegas hotels. But it expands and the restaurant itself is really nice.   Our server, Tosh, was incredibly nice and so were the other busboys. We ordered two baos, the pear and burrata salad, and the salt and pepper lobster and shrimp.   The pork and shrimp baos left a lot to be desired. They lacked flavor and were overall really plain; and at 7 dollars a pop, we were sure we wouldn't order them again.   The burrata was the one saving grace of our visit. Although is wasn't a traditional burrata cheese ball, it was creamy and a really well balanced, delicious dish. Definitely would get this again.   Lastly, the most disappointing item was the salt and pepper lobster shrimp. Mind you, this is one of their signature items. My god, I have never eaten something as salty at a restaurant. I love salty food and I tend to over-salt my own food, but this was just insane. It was so salty it stung my mouth as I ate it. We actually felt dehydrated hours after. Tosh graciously offered to replace it and brought out a fresh batch with a cucumber salad to balance the saltiness. Unfortunately, even the new batch which had \"light seasoning\" was still over the top salty. We had to scrape off the batter to eat it.   6/5 stars for the great service. 2/5 for the food. We really appreciated Tosh's efforts and also the fact that the chef brought out the cucumber salad to balance the salty food. We were excited to go to the new Majordomo restaurant in LA, but we're really not too sure anymore. The lobster needs some serious fixing.",

    "text": "I heard a lot about the NY Momofuku, wonderful things about the food, so when I heard that it was coming to Vegas got excited.   So we finally decided to visit this place that is located inside Cosmopolitan Hotel on the 2nd floor. It's a bigger place than the ones on NYC, this has more tables, you can choose sitting on the bar area that is right on the entrance, or go for a more formal dinner on the back.   To start we ordered shishito peppers (always a must wherever we go) and the pork Belly Buns, beautiful pieces served with a juicy meat, ready to be devour. I really like this one, perfect evening start. Then we ordered the Pork Noodles, good flavor, nice portion and everything you need your noodles to be.  Also hubby was excited about ordering the the fried chicken and caviar AND WOW! Perfect for a big party -  2 chickens are fried whole, then carved, served with truffle creme and ginger pancakes paired with your choice of momofuku reserve caviar. We loved it, for me the combination of eating this dish in a \"taco\" form with the pancakes was just PERFECT!  I would recommend this one ONLY FOR  BIG PARTIES, unless you want to have lunch and dinner leftovers for the rest of the week (lol)    The reason of my 4 stars - So I would recommend this place, but for some reason I prefer the NYC location I don't know if its the vibe or food is just a tiny bit different, or is just me. But yes I would say to you, visit this place!   -SPANISH:  Escuche mucho a cerca de este lugar en NY, empezando con la comida que es deliciosa, entonces al escuchar que abririan un nuevo local en Las Vegas me emocione.   Asi que finalmente decidimos visitar este lugar localizado dentro de Cosmopolitan Hotel en el 2do piso. Es un lugar mas grande que el de Nueva York, con mas mesas y la opcion de reservar. Tambien puedes escoger entre sentarse en el bar que esta a la entrada o un poco mas elegante en la parte de atras.   Empezamos ordenando los Shisito Peppers (siempre en donde hay ordenamos) y los Pork Buns, delicioso platillo donde una pieza jugosa de puerco es envuelta en un Bun, listo para ser devorado. Siguiendo con un plato de Pork Noodles, con una perfecta porcion, que contiene todo lo que necesitas para disfrutar de una buena sopa.   La entrada fuerte, donde debo decir mi esposo estaba muy emocionado por pedirla fue Pollo Frito con Caviar - 2 pollos enteros fritos, desmenuzados, servidos con panqueques hechos de trufa y jengibre. Todo esto acompanado de uno de los caviares a escoger. Este platillo es perfecto para grupos grandes! Al menos que quieras tener sobras para toda una semana (jaja)  En resumen la razon de mis 4 estrellas es que si disfrute de este lugar pero mi local favorito es el de NY no se si sea por la vibra, que la comida es buena pero un poquito diferente o simplemente una idea mia. Pero si definitivamente tienes que probar este lugar si tienes la oportunidad!",

Possibly one of the best I've ever had. However the ramen was only okay, and I think way overpriced because of that.  For dessert we got a slice of birthday cake from Milk. The slice was huge and it's SOOOO sweet. Love the cream cheese frosting, but gosh was it heavy and sweet.  I wanted to like Momofuku so bad because I like David Chang, but unfortunately only thought it was ok.",

Noodles were not too soggy and the pork belly was AMAZING! There was a light crunch to the pork belly edges   The staff were really friendly and our server/bartender shared some of their favorites. Ended up going with the melon king crab. It was such a sweet and light addition to our meal, very different from savory crab dishes.  Dranksss: cherry milk punch!! It's good if you like sour types of alcohol. Our bartender was kind enough to explain how our drink is made and yes if you're lactose intolerant don't get this drink because there is milk in it despite not being able to see it (see picture).   Lastly dessert. We got the birthday cake slice from the Milk bar connected to Momofuku. It was sweet and the cereal taste to it made it very different than your average confetti cake!   Overall- YUMZ all around!",

    "text": "Overall: 5/5. Did not read much into this place, but decided to go based on many recommendations. Well worth it! On the pricier end though, so be careful.  Service: 4/5. Our waiter went through the favorite dishes at different price points and described the dishes well. When things started to get busy around there, she was still able to make time to check on us and make sure that we were comfortable. There was a puddle near one of the tables that took a while for them to quarantine and resulted in a few customers slipping. I believe they compensated the victims for the accident.   Ambiance: 5/5. A great balance of contemporary styles of new world and old!  Value: 4/5. While the food was delicious. I think the higher prices were a result of imported ingredients. Hence, the higher price tags. Please be wary of that when you go in.   Food: I only ordered one lunch plate, but included a photo one of the dishes my mother ordered. I feel like I can only judge the dish I ordered since I spent the most time on it.   5 Spice Duck Ssam: 5/5. Sliced breast, leg confit, and ginger crepe. I was told combining all of the pieces into a lettuce wrap would make for the best experience. I definitely agree! The duck skin was really crispy and the meat was tender. A quality duck breast! The fried rice was savory! I honestly thought the lettuce was fake, because of how bright and vibrant it looked! I was pleasantly surprised. The eggs were soft and cooked to perfection, but would not work without the duck and the rice. The entire thing formed a wonderful asian fusion dish to be proud of!",

I ordered a whiskey drink, I think it was called Toki time? They are all around $17 each...pricey, but delicious. I definitely recommend.   Service was great and attentive. For the food, we went with family style.   Sweet and sour green beans - so thin! But a good veggie to snack on.   Shishito Peppers - like my friends described it, it's like roulette. You may be lucky and get a REALLY spicy one. Great flavor and appetizer to snack on if you like the pepper taste.   Pork belly buns - AMAZING! My favorite besides the drinks. The pork belly was crispy on the outsides, the bun was so soft. The pickled cucumber added a nice crunch to the bun. I would at least order one bun per person...AT LEAST!   Branzino - really well made. Wasn't too dry, and came right off the plate/bone. Delicious!   5 spice roasted duck - a pretty large meal. I enjoyed eating it with the wraps more than the lettuce wraps. They even deep fry the remaining bones/meat and bring it back to the table to not waste any of the duck.   Popcorn cake - In my opinion, this was a little too sweet for me. I was thinking that this would be more on the savory side, but it was pretty rich/buttery.   Crack pie - really good and buttery! It was especially good with the milk soft serve. I really enjoyed this dessert.   Pricey restaurant, but I'd definitely come back for the pork belly buns, crack pie and drinks! I would want to try the ramen too!",

    "text": "TLDR: Very unique tasting food at a $$$$ price. Don't let the $$ on Yelp fool you; this place is straight up BOUGIE.   We decided to finally try the famous David Chang's Momofuku. The ambience was very hipster and modern, as you would expect. We were seated immediately without a reservation.   We ordered: CHILLED SPICY NOODLES (4.5/5): This was a very well done dish! The sauce was reminiscent of pesto, but not quite that. The sausages were hot, but the noodles themselves were cold. The candied cashews added a sweet kick to each bite. Definitely a great way to start off your meal.  HOZON RICE CAKES (5/5): This was absolutely stellar. It was basically fried Korean deokkboki in a mushroomy sauce. The rice cakes had a crispy outer layer and a chewy inner layer - absolutely divine. The sauce was so fragrant. It reminded me of carbonara and mushroom sauce combined, but did not taste heavy or creamy. This dish was a perfect blend of Korean and Italian flavors. An absolute must order.  WILD ALASKAN KING SALMON (4/5): This whopping dish was $50!! Definitely not worth the price, but the taste and preparation was phenomenal. The dish it really quite simple - it is just a filet of salmon smoked on cedarwood with no garnishes. The filet flaked beautifully and had a delicious smokey taste.   WAGYU TRI-TIP (4/5): This dish was very simple. It was just the steak + some sunchoke on the side. The sunchoke was somehow ridiculously delicious, considering its just...sunchoke. In fact, I may have loved it more than the steak itself. Not that the tri-tip was anything short of delicious. It was so so soft - almost a prime rib or filet mignon quality. Delicious.  BUCATINI (5/5): This was an absolute gorgeous blend of Asian and Italian flavors. The bucatini noodles were cooked al dente, so it had a great chew to it. But what wowed me most was the sauce. The sauce was not heavy - it tasted like a blend of cacio de pepe/salted egg yolk. Nothing like I've ever tasted before.  I think someone was watching us as we were eating. The moment we finished one dish, another was brought to our table. Great, attentive service, and awesome atmosphere.   Ok note though: they charged us $1 each for our water, which confused me. But I guess it's Vegas.   Anyways, I'm so glad I was able to finally dine at one of David Chang's establishments. This restaurant serves absolutely artful dishes, and the price tag shows.",

We were lucky to have snatch two seats at the bar where you can watch the chefs in action. That was in itself a treat.   The most expensive on the menu had to be the fried chicken and caviar (Golden Osetra) at $1,488. Since I am not a baller like that, hopefully someone else can comment on that dish.  Instead, I can comment on things that I did have. We started with the spicy cucumbers. It was made with cucumbers of course, some sort of puree with avocado, and togarashi red pepper flakes. It was really delicious and refreshing on a hot day.   Next, we tried the grilled asparagus with miso butter and lemon. It was really good!  Finally, our main course which was the Jidori Chicken. It serves two people because it was a whole chicken. It was topped with curry powder, lime zest, and served with a side of kimchi and rice with ginger garnish on top. The chicken was so tender, it melts in your mouth. Overall, it was a very good meal. I highly recommend this place if you are in Vegas. Also, make sure to make a reservation before going so that you don't have a long wait.",

    "text": "As someone who discovered David Chang through his guest appearances on Buzzfeed's Worth It series and still needs to watch his Netflix show Ugly Delicious, I wanted to at some point try Momofuku, and this trip to Las Vegas granted me the opportunity!  Momofuku is located in The Cosmopolitan hotel on the 2nd floor along with a variety of other restaurants. If you're driving, I'd recommend parking in the underground parking garage of the hotel; it's free up to the first hour and $7 for 1-4 hours.  We came around 12pm on a Saturday and were seated immediately at the open kitchen bar seating (I find it fun to watch the cooks prepare dishes during meals). The restaurant has a very clean, modern design, and I like the variety of seating it offers: high tables, bar seating, open kitchen bar seating, and a spacious section for regular seating. I like how it gives off a simple yet classy vibe, which means you can feel comfortable dressing up or down when eating here.  We started off with the $16 Spicy Chilled Noodles and two $7 Pork Belly Buns. I REALLY LIKED THE SPICY CHILLED NOODLES AND RECOMMEND TRYING/SHARING IT. They add pesto, Sichuan sausage, thai basil, and candied cashews to create a delicious and more-on-the-unique-side noodle dish. I recommend trying the Pork Belly Buns if you've never had good pork belly buns before, but they're skippable if you've had.  We then had two of the lunch plate options, the $17 Slow Roasted Pork Shoulder Bowl (added an egg on top) and the $48 5 Spice Rotisserie Duck. The slow roasted pork shoulder was some of the best pork shoulder I've ever had in terms of flavor and tenderness, and I highly recommend this dish. The 5 Spice Rotisserie Duck, which included duck breast and leg confit (fattier and tastier than the breast), was good, but not worth the price (see reasoning below).  Overall, if you're eating lunch here, I'd recommend ordering one $16 Spicy Chilled Noodles, one $17 Slow Roasted Pork Shoulder Bowl, and either two of their buns or another dish for every two people. We ordered more because we were hungry and eat a lot haha. I don't recommend ordering any of the duck options (they have different portion sizes) because while good, they're not as worth it compared to specialized roasted duck restaurants.  Momofuku does it right by keeping everything simple, clean, and good, from the service to the interior decor to the menu design and to the food. While you can definitely get some of their dishes at a more worth-it price at more specialized Asian restaurants, Momofuku has done a terrific job of spearheading the category of food it belongs to: Asian Fusion.",

    "text": "I wanted to LOVE this so badly but can only say I like it enough. I had the Caesar salad (too saucy), mushroom buns (too sweet), ginger scallion noodles (kinda sweet), rice cake (special vegetarian dish, sweet but very good!), and long beans (too saucy). While all of it was really good, it was a bit too sugary/saucy for my liking. I think most people will really love the taste however! My favorite was the rice cake dish, which was not on the menu that evening but special made for the herbivore that is me.  Also I was soooo excited to try the crack pie and birthday cake. Sad to say it was a bit underwhelming, although this could've been due to my high ass expectations. I can definitely see how crack pie is addictive- it has this slightly sweet/slightly salty and chewy texture to it. Delicious :P  The ambiance is really nice- chic, beautiful- perfect for a night in Vegas.",

    "text": "Crazy awesome dining experience.  It was late after landing and we were skeptical since eating at one of the many momofuku places in NYC. That dining experience was average.  This one killed it.  My wife is picky and she was thrilled with everything.    The waitress was amazing, Jenna.  Helps she is from our home state of WA. She guided us through the menu and did not disappoint with suggestions.  She even messed up with one of the orders and comped us for the mistake (expected but very cool way she handled it).    The buns are crazy good- as others recommended. The beans are spot on with crispy on the outside and perfect soft inside. The pumpkin ribs, crazy good. But the Apple kimchi salad with that maple yogurt sauce is off the charts amazing.    Definitely coming back here next time in Vegas!!!",

    "text": "We came with a large party to celebrate an engagement and were looking for something different. Boy did we find just what we were looking for!  We did a chef tasting menu and they let us choose a price point from $80-150 per person. We went with $100 per and despite being on the lower end it was more food than any of us could handle. Id say we had 6-8 different dishes in total.  They started us out with several appetizers. The most notable were the oysters and shishito peppers. The oysters were fresh and came with smoked roe which gave them such depth of flavor ive never had in oysters. The shishito peppers were covered in a powdered condensed milk (sounds weird i know) but it created a unique balance of spice and cream.  Yet this was a mere precursor to our outstanding entrees. We had the Bo Ssam which is a slow roasted whole pork shoulder that came with lettuce wraps and 3 house made sauces. The lettuce wraps are meant to be eaten with the pork... And wait for it.... More oysters! Very different but once again they make the flavor pairings work.  We also had a pasta dish that was similar to an Italian bolognese but with Asian ingredients (i was so blown away I can't even recall the name). However, as amazing as this was, I haven't gotten to the main attraction.  The most impressive item was the 5 spice rotisserie duck. First they bring out this beautifully roasted duck breast, they proceed to slice it in front of you and place it over a bed of sticky rice and duck leg confit. They added more house made sauces and both lettuce wraps as well as chive pancakes... But that's not all! They took the carcass back to the kitchen, break it down and deep fry it, and came back out with what are basically fried duck wings...   All in all chef David Chang certainly knows how to do Asian fusion and while its not a cheap dinner, you get a ton of bang for your buck. There's many choices in vegas for an elegant dinner, but when considering flavor, presentation, and unique offerings, id take momofuku over anything else.",

    "text": "Charlie Rose: \"Here's the big question: Is David Chang Einstein or Edison?\"  David Chang: \"Are you kidding me? ...I'm just a chef.\"  On March 29th, almost eight months after our first trip to Momofuku, we all came back for another fabulous dinner. As amazing as it was the first time, this second Momofuku adventure blew me away. It could have been because we were seated at the most exclusive table in house. It might be because we were welcomed instantly with a glass of bubbly rose. Or maybe it was because I was spoiled senseless as the birthday girl but what a crazy night --- Three hours of nonstop gluttony with some of my most favorite people in the world.  After the beautiful glass of rose, a dish of birthday oysters were presented. \"Other places do the cheesy $0.80 dessert. We do things differently here...\" I felt like my soul was being flirted with. Blow out the candle, squeeze on some lemon, a quick oyster cheers with the table, and down it goes. Fresh, oceanic, and clean. I was instantly hungry for more.  After that was a gorgeous plate of bigeye tuna with french strawberries and shaved foie gras. This is no longer on their menu but what Jon H. wants, Jon H. gets. Eat it with a spoon and try not to lick the plate.   Next were the pork belly buns because who goes to Momofuku without getting the buns? Delicious! Use that Ssam sauce liberally because it is dang good.  Fluke tartare? Why not? Cabbage and nori topped with ostera caviar and lemon zest... clean taste throughout with a burst of nutty flavor from the caviar. Delicate textures with a smooth finish. No fishy aftertaste here. Easily one of my favorite bites. It was refreshing.  Miso sea bass with crab butter, mushrooms, and roasted vegetable broth topped with thick generous slices of truffles. Pour the broth on the truffles and enjoy.  An off-the-menu carbonara-esque dish was served and with it, more shaved truffles. Like the pork belly bao, you have to get noodles at Momofuku. It's hard to say what was my favorite bite of the night but this dish was definitely one of the most memorable. The truffles worked insanely well in this dish. So fragrant and well balanced. While being surrounded with a gorgeous grilled steak and a delicately cooked sea bass, this simple dish was the one I went back to time and time again. Jon said it would have been better with avocados [I'M KIDDING!].  Dry-aged cote de boeuf. A beautiful 32 oz. of creekstone prime beef, grilled and finished with marrow butter. Served with wagyu fried rice and charred broccolini with chile jam. Crispy potatoes with horseradish and creme fraice and chives were also served but not apart of the beautiful cote de boeuf offering but also enjoyed immensely. Don't forget to bite the bone... There's flavor on the bone.  Lastly is the dessert and a parting cocktail. The sultry tones of \"Happy Birthday\" was practically whispered by Hadely, a tray of Milk Bar goodies was set before me, and more candles were to be blown out. The infamous Crack Pie with Fruity [Pebbles] Cereal Milk soft serve and regular Cereal Milk soft serve was presented and devoured. To finish things off, a cold brew cocktail. Light a cigarette for me, even though I don't smoke, because what a highly foodie-erotic and intoxicating evening. My word.   Hats off and many thanks to Victor, Mighty Mags, Hadely, Adem, and of course my friends Jon H. and his lovely wife for such a fabulous meal. I was surprised by this flawlessly orchestrated evening. I'll be biting my fist at the culinary masterpiece memory forever.  TL;DR Momofuku is still Momofukin' bomb.  A ta sante!",

    "text": "This place has a really cool vibe to it. It feels like you just stepped into a trendy restaurant in New York, except you're in Vegas! My sister and I made a reservation the night prior. We went on a Tuesday night, so it was  definitely easy to grab a table at dinner time. Service was extremely attentive and friendly, so that made our experience all the better.  Onto the food. Between the two of us we ordered the Old Fashioned & Yuzu Lemonade. I didn't really feel like consuming any alcohol that day so lemonade for me! We also got still water which was offered to us once we sat down. Ended up getting charged $1 per person, which isn't bad but I wish they could've just offered me free tap water first. We ordered the pork belly buns, black truffle ramen and miso sea bass.  Out of the three dishes, I would really only recommend getting the pork belly buns. These were AMAZING. It comes with two, but I wish it came with more! I honestly thought it tasted perfect without the additional sauce they provide, but I'll let you be the judge of that.  Black truffle ramen - definitely not worth $50. That's right. $50 RAMEN. THERE WASN'T EVEN ANY MEAT IN THERE. It is jam packed with flavor, I'll give it that. But I don't think I'd get this again. Apparently this might be taken off the menu soon, which was the main reason why we ended up getting it just to try it out.  Miso sea bass. I can see other people loving this dish, but this honestly just tasted like the sea bass dish my mom could make at home. It's nice when a restaurant reminds you of home, but honestly. If I could get the same thing at home, I'd just go home. The outside char on the sea bass was really really nice though. That part I loved. The fried enoki mushroom was a nice touch too.  My sister made the reservation to celebrate my new job and they were nice enough to bring out a celebratory cookie!!! That was so sweet of them. We also got the crack pie. YUM. My sister described it as that sweet asian dessert you could get at asian baguette shops haha. I can't think of anything more similar than that.  I wouldn't mind coming here again. Maybe with a larger group to try out their larger dishes.",

    "text": "I had to be honest, I went into Momofuku full of high expectations and left rather disappointed.   After a long day and hearing so much about the Momofuku noodle bar, I wanted a bowl of warm soupy ramen so I ordered the Black truffle ramen which comes cooked in a savory broth with shaved truffle mushrooms, scallion, and egg yolk.   As with any food that commands such a high price tag, I expect to leave happy. The thick broth had a good flavor but a bit gritty - whether from the cooked noodles or the winter truffles - I am not sure. The microplane shaved truffle was okay - very light in flavor. The noodle is probably the star of the dish as it tasted fresh and texturally pleasant. I understand truffle is expensive but I have had plenty of truffles in my lifetime, mostly thinly sliced truffles, and they all packed a great amount of flavor. I don't mind the simplicity of the ingredients but, over all, to command $50 for this bowl of ramen is a bit over the top.   I must say the service was excellent here with many attentive and hardworking staff. That's why I would give it a 3 star instead of 2.",

    "text": "My brother Andrew C. turned 30 this month, and Matt B. and I met him and Celestine H. for a celebratory weekend in Vegas. His birthday fell on a Saturday, and we got a late lunch at Momofuku, making a same-day reservation for 2:30 in the afternoon.  I love David Chang's restaurants. I remember going to the original Noodle Bar, Ssam Bar, and Milk Bar with Andrew a decade ago, when he was a student in New York. The Vegas Momofuku is sort of a Noodle and Ssam Bar hybrid, with a Milk Bar set up in an adjoining space in the Cosmopolitan.  The restaurant was large and attractive--there's really no better way to describe it than to say that it looked like a Momofuku joint, trendy in a hipster New York way, with blonde wood and neon and eye-catching murals. It was peaceful when we went, probably because we were there so late. By the time we finished lunch, it was just us and the employees, having their staff meal.  I wonder in retrospect if they needed to get us out of there to clean up before dinner service, because our lunch started out at a pretty frenetic pace. We ordered and then suddenly our table was carpeted in food, eight dishes brought out in the span of fifteen minutes. When I asked them to slow it down, they listened, then checked in on us a number of times, finally bringing out the rest of our meal when I asked, about half an hour later. I feel like they were scared of me, though I swear, I wasn't a jerk about it. The staff was very nice and attentive, though, overall. The pacing was the only issue.  We drank cocktails with our lunch, and these were fantastic. Vegas is full of bad, expensive cocktails, so I was happy to have good, expensive ones at Momofuku. I loved the Garden Gnome, a refreshing highball of gin, yellow chartreuse, and soda with shiso, mint, and snap pea. Likewise the What the Pho?, a sweet and spicy cocktail made with cachaca, basil, jalapeno, honey, and lime. The Penicillin--scotch, ginger, lemon, honey, and smoke--and the Yuzu Negroni--sale, gin, Campari, and Punt e Mes--were both great variations on classic drinks. On the stirred, boozy side, I liked the Boots of Spanish Leather with rum, Oloroso sherry, amaro, and bitters, as well as the Rosita, made with mezcal, vermouth, Campari, and bitters. We were also charged $4 for something called Vero water. I guess the house water wasn't free.  The food was excellent. We started with a couple crudos, as well as the pork belly buns and a tasting of country hams. The Hawaiian kampachi was silky and delicate, served in a flavorful lemon dashi with snow peas and chive. I also loved the bigeye tuna, which came with strawberry and a decadent heap of shaved foie gras. The hams were lovely, served with redeye mayo and juicy slices of nectarine. And I'm always a fan of Momofuku's pork belly buns, pillowy steamed buns loaded with fat slabs of pork belly, hoisin, cucumber, and scallion.  The next batch of food, which hit the table while we were still working on the first, brought our noodle bowls and vegetables. Momofuku's ramen has been divisive since Noodle Bar's inception, but I'm firmly in the pro-Chang camp. The shoyu pork ramen was well done, the springy noodles and rich, soothing broth supplemented with pork belly, pork shoulder, and a slow-poached egg. I also liked the ginger scallion noodles, which came with pickled shiitake and wakame. On the vegetable side, I thought the sweet and sour long beans were fantastic, snappy and intensely flavorful, cooked with ginger, garlic, and black vinegar.  We rounded out our meal with two of the lunch plates and a rice bowl. The grilled lamb ribs were superb, deeply savory and perfectly tender, the meat sliding off the bone. They came with cucumber and a great chili yogurt. The grilled stripe bass was a nice, meaty piece of fish, served with mushrooms, snow peas, and an addictive kimchi butter, which we asked to get on the side for my picky husband's benefit. The bo ssam bowl was a hefty bibimbap laden with kimchi and other pickled vegetables. Our waiter put the glazed pork shoulder on the side without being asked so that Matt could enjoy it without kimchi--a thoughtful touch. I liked this bibimbap and would recommend it if you don't eat bibimbap often, but it was the one thing we ordered that I could take or leave.  We didn't order dessert (we were full and also had a dinner reservation at Joel Robuchon in five hours), but we'd mentioned it was Andrew's birthday earlier in the meal, and our waiter brought us a plate of birthday cake truffles, one of them stuck with a candle. This was really nice, and the truffles were great--dense balls of cake unapologetically exploding with sugar.  This was one hell of a feast, full of delicious food and blessedly wonderful cocktails. There's no lack of good restaurants in Vegas, but Momofuku is pretty hard to beat.",

Since we were a larger group, we gave Daniel a budget and he brought food to our table (we did not pick).   They have some really really good shrimp/lobster, brussel sprouts and the duck. Their raw tuna with caviar was not that good (almost all of us were disappointed as it was a very pricey plate but very poor flavor and portion.   The back of the restaurant has a nice view of the Vegas strip and is a nice place for a group.   In addition, they have a good wine selection and very accommodating staff in general.",

We couldn't get over the view.  Pork Belly Buns -5/5  omg. so good that we had to order more Ginger Scallion Noodles - 3.5/5 good, unique, but not our favorite Truffle Ramen - 4.5/5 the deep mushroom flavor was sooo good and exploding with umami Oysters - 4/5 pricy, but very fresh Bigeye Tuna - 5/5 there was grated foie gras that melted in your mouth. the tuna was really light and tasty, too.  Overall, it was quite pricy for the smaller portions. I would have given this place a 4.5, but the view really made the experience so good.  Note: you can also order anything on the Milk menu for dessert even though they don't have the full menu for you to take a look.",

Since there were 12 of us, we had a sweet little VIP section in the back with our own private bathroom. Service was top notch. They just kept bringing more and more and more food out!!! By the time we were done, we needed a moment to loosen our belts before we could tackle that delicious dessert sampler.   Everything made my mouth water. It was sooooo good!!! If only I could eat like that every day lol. The duck was divine. So buttery and smooth. It literally melts in your mouth. The Chilean sea bass was cooked perfectly!!! I'm having flashbacks and craving it right now!!! The truffle ramen!!! Ohhh my!!! That truffle ramen!!! I'm sure they rolled those noodles in the back and cooked them fresh!!! Sheesh!!! So savory. Fried duck bones, also a winner!!! Spicy cucumber salad = refreshing!! The spice was a 3 out of 10. The fried peppers are hit and miss on the spicy scale. I got one that was a 4. A friend got one that was about a 9. Left her in tears lol. Overall AMAZING experience. I would go back time and time again so I could try everything on the menu!!!",

We were hungry and had heard good things about Momofuku. It was nearby; there was no line; and we had caught a ride to The Strip (parking wasn't a concern).  We walked to The Cosmopolitan Hotel and looked forward to a nice meal.  Somehow, I wasn't feeling it...  I asked for a table, but we were given a high top with stools. There were backs on the chairs, but it took some balance to be comfortable. I pointed to the seats by the window, but was told that they weren't available at this time.  (sad face)  Maybe because we arrived in between lunch and dinner, the menu was limited. I felt like we only had a choice of Pork Belly Buns and ramen.  We decided to skip the pricey ramen and just get two orders of the Pork Belly Buns so that each of us could have a $7 bun. Yeah...  I did like my bun!  The taste was good!  The pork belly was a thick, generous slab with an outer sear and a moist, fatty interior!  I treated it as an appetizer and looked forward to dining elsewhere...  I realize that this is the Strip where prices are higher. I think that service should be top notch.  Somehow, I felt disappointed.  I guess we were there at an off time?  Maybe I should come at a different time?",

The black truffle didn't overpower the whole bowl. It gave the broth a unique, buttery flavor. The noodles were a medium sized thickness and the pork was tender. The egg was presented without the egg white; just a soft yolk. The bowl was $50, which is very steep for a standard size bowl of ramen, but I understand that black truffle is an expensive delicacy.   I wish that I had the chance to try a more classic style ramen, so I could truly taste chef David Chang's version of it. But, I'm assuming they rotate the items of the menu often and I just happened to come when they were serving this unique ramen. I would come back to try a different ramen next time.",

Pork Shoyu Ramen - $17 - Great depth of flavor, the egg was poached to perfection. The pork belly was crispy and the pork shoulder was oh - sooooo tender. HOWEVER, the noodles were too soft. When the bowl first came out, it was room temperature. The bowl had been sitting out for quite awhile. Time Frame: It had been exactly 26 minutes from the time I initially ordered.....to the time I was able to take my first sip. The server took my bowl back and brought a brand new bowl out. They added an extra piece of pork belly this time around, but the noodles were still overcooked - too soft.   Ginger Scallion Noodles - $16 - A mixture of shiitake and cucumber, a little too overdressed. The flavor ruined my entire palette and I was in desperate need of water throughout the meal.   I was torn between my usual Eggslut or if I should try something different, Momofuku. I've been to the New York location and can positively say, the food is better there and the service. Who knows, maybe I'll try it on my next trip to Vegas and it'll change. For the time being, I'm sticking to Eggslut. Sorry David Chang.",

To be honest, I think we've just about tried everything on the menu as well as some off the menu items that have been available when we are there.   The bo ssam is my very favorite dish and I could eat that every day if not for the fact that it would probably kill me to do so.   I can't think of enough good things to say about this place.

They were pretty good with the saam sauce (?) but you can see the oil drip out of the bun. After that, our ramen came out. I thought ramen was going to be great hangover food, but omg this was the oiliest. I know ramen was oily, but this has like half an inch of oil in it or something. Everything was coated in oil. I think I pooped oil for a good week after this meal... haha... I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.  Come here if you like your foods extra oily and oysters overpriced.",

    "text": "2.5 stars.  I had pretty high expectations of Momofuku, being a baby of David Chang's the giganto superchef.  Momofuku is located at the Cosmopolitan.  Best friend had made a reservation here for her birthday about a month in advance, so we eagerly waited a month before it was time to arrive.  We were let in earlier than our set reservation time, which was nice!  The restaurant was nearly full at 6:30, but service was friendly and efficient.  So what went wrong?  1.  Dirty glasses.  Best friend and her boyfriend ordered sake.  Their glasses were sticky and dirty.  While this was quickly rectified by our server, the cleanliness was a major concern, as one of the glasses still had lipstick on it!  2.  A5 wagyu w/ Potatoes.  I love me some A5 wagyu.  In fact, I love it so much I order it at nearly all of the restaurants that serve it so I bask in it's buttery presence.  The A5 on this dish wasn't the problem.  It was the idea that the fat would drip down and add additional flavor to the potatoes underneath that were covered in garlic and salt.  There was no need to overdress the potatoes, it absolutely was over kill on the delicate flavor of the A5.  3.  King crab cocktail - you get 3 pieces for $48.  I get it, it's Vegas, it's Momofuku... but for $48 I can get 2 large legs coming out to 2 pounds at Costco, steam it myself, and it would still taste better than the small pieces of legs you get here.  Value? Bad.  Not to mention there are countless buffets in Vegas where you can get king crab legs AYCE for far less.  4.   Denver steak - The medium rare throughout this steak was nearly perfect, but the ends were too done on the outside which made them almost inedible.  Flavor wise, I wasn't too excited.  The rice was not fully cooked and was hard in some bites. The pickled cucumbers on top probably did not sit in the pickling brine long enough.    The saving grace of the night was the pork belly buns.  This was tasty enough to keep me from being upset with the experience.  My complaint though? Again with the under pickled cucumbers!!",

Next the second special of the day arrived... a big bowl of \"ramen featuring white truffles\".  We were told it would have 5 oz of white truffle shavings on top. It had Bonito flakes, but we could not detect any truffles...$75.00. Our quick lunch at Momofuku was $184 for two people and we left disappointed, hungry and stunned as we are BIG David Chang fans.

The beef noodles were equivalent to Chef Boyardee.  The kimchi stew and oysters were buffet quality at best.  The only things that didn't completely disappoint were the pork belly buns and shishito peppers.  Even then I would definitely not recommend this place to anyone.  The service on the other hand was incredible.  You would never need to ask for more water.  They were friendly and fast.",

The menu is quite different from the New York location, where it is not just noodles, but there are a bunch of unique meal options. Definitely try the shrimp buns and the hozon rice cakes. You'll savor literally every bite and have to hold yourself back from licking the plate...  The drink menu is just as unique, and everything is delicious.  Both the food and the drinks are quite pricey, so coming here is definitely a treat, but the food is well worth it.",

    "text": "I joined a friend for an early dinner at Momofuku at the Cosmo.  I'd been curious about Momofuku restaurants for ages, but I never had the opportunity to swing by one of the NYC outposts.  The new Strip location is convenient, and spacious too.  Momofuku knocks it out of the park in terms of atmosphere.  The front bar area is casual and lively, while the dining room in the back is more upscale, with an eye-popping panoramic view of the Strip.  (Seriously, request a window seat when making your reservation.)  After being seated, our server came by to take our orders.  We skipped the booze this time around, instead choosing to indulge in an array of different buns -- pork belly, shrimp, and chicken karaage.  The karaage was easily my favorite, with a nice crisp and tender center.  The shrimp was tasty too, but a little on the briny side.  While my guest loved the pork belly, I found it too fatty and gristly.  (I think we just had very different expectations.)  Where Momofuku knocks it out of the park is the ramen.  I had the chickpea ramen with scallions, chickpea miso, and bokchoy.  I absolutely loved the rich, miso-infused broth, and the doneness of the bokchoy.  The superstars of the dish were the crispy chickpeas sprinkled generously on top, which are addictive in both texture and flavor.  Service is friendly and efficient; the prices are hilariously out-of-control.  I get that the Cosmo is a high-rent space, but the prices are literally twice what they should be.    Minor gripes aside, I'm 99% sure I'll be back to Momofuku -- if for no other reason than that chickpea ramen.",

But it is just as good albeit in a more fancier setting. We had reservations for lunch, came a bit earlier and got seated right away by the window. It was me and 3 friends (they haven't tasted Momofuku before) and our table ordered pork buns, ginger scallion noodles, chickpea ramen, pork ramen, shishito pepper appetizer, cucumber salad, and a Shaved Foie Gras over Raw Big Eye Tuna. My friends were blown away by the bold flavors and flavor combinations with the best dish of the day being the tuna. Foie Gras simply complements the raw fish wonderfully. We were tempted to eat here again for dinner even though we had reservations for Jaleo. We ate at Jaleo, but came back at midnight for late night eating and to try the spicy fried chicken sandwich which was great. It's like a glorified take on fast food chicken sandwich. I know we still have to come back for the big family meal with dinner service but we are so looking forward to it.",

While service was attentive and informed, the food was..... meh....  We were aiming to eat light and so our dinner included the following: - shishito peppers: had a light brown powder dusted on it, and yet it completely lacked flavor.  - spicy cucumber: this was a miss. It was covered with a light green wasabi sauce. Again, no flavor, just a green sauce... where is the salt, where is the garlic, where is the flavor? - crudite plate: this was an unexpected surprise. I wasn't thrilled with the idea of paying for crudite but this came with two great sauces, a lovely take on hummus and another on bacon ranch sauce). Both the sauces were delicious and the par-blanched vegetables were a great vehicle for eating the sauce. There was also some pickled cauliflower. The only thing is that cucumbers were kinda overly cold and spongy. - fried brussel sprouts - over fried and then sauced with a sweet/sour glaze.  I've had better, my dining companion thought it was delicious. So I'll let you decide. - asparagus with bone marrow - fancy sounding, bland tasting.  - ginger/sesame cold noodles. A fellow diner recommended it to us, and so, sure, I'll take a stab.  NOT.WORTH.IT  skip. Again the cucumbers were disappointing (can we please partially peel the skins?).  I dunno.. This isn't the same Momofuku that I frequently dine at and love in NYC...  I think they need to get David Chang in to fix up the kitchen.",

David Chang aka Korean guy -  goes to Japan (read up on Japan-korea relations) to study Ramen then goes back to the states and charge the Ramen almost twice the cost. It's almost like a caucasian guy going to Africa to study the cuisine, then returns to the States doing the same thing what David Chang did. Another insult to the people of Japan, the Ramen wasn't all that. I've had better. Now I can say, I dined at Momofuku and the Ramen was terribly s**tty.   The True memorable dish was chilled spicy noodles. Perfect balance for sweat, savory and just the right amount of heat. Highly recommended!   Service wise. they do cater a stroller.

    "text": "So, it was a weekend out with the wifey away from the kiddies thanks to the MIL and the powers that be.  Needless to say, we felt a bit out of place when sitting in a space full of graphic art (by David Choe) and the young staff that weren't either workers at the bouncy house or au pairs.  Nevertheless, this installment from the K-bro David Chang was pretty nice.  To start off, the service (they get 5 stars without question) was awesome and to much of our enjoyment Sarah was pleasant and very helpful.  The water service was crazy awesome, like as in, I felt as though I didn't deserve any of it (but I desperately needed, as indicated below) I think that's the old timer in me talking.    Unfortunately though, the vaunted ramen from Momofuku was a salty mess.  I know, David Chang's  original vision about his restaurants was to make food that he (and his buddies) would like, and they don't give a crap if others don't...but I guess there was enough of a following of this NaCl laden palate busting concentrate of high quality ingredients that has led him to multiple restaurants and $$$$$.  More power to him and his empire.    I wish I can say it was deep and balanced in flavor and reminded my time in Osaka and Tokyo, but it didn't.  It felt like someone made a huge mistake (which I am hoping) by adding too much of the sodium associated ingredients or forgoting to add the appropriate amount of H2O to make the soup more palatable.  I usually enjoy finishing off the broth of ramen, however, I didn't even finish the noodles.  We also ordered the buns, which were pretty good.  The mushrooms and the pork belly were delicious.    Listen, I get it.  It doesn't matter what I say.  I'm just saying that this is not a place I'd eat ramen.  And if I were ever to seek out ramen again, I will not think of Momofuku...unless they made a huge mistake.",

    "text": "Overpriced, unbalanced flavors, and awkward experience is the best way I can describe Momofuku.   First of all, this place is waaay overpriced for the food that it offers. I ordered one shrimp bun (bao) and the price for one is $7. I didn't think it was anything special really. It tasted good, but then I realized I can get a whole tray of bao for $7 somewhere else... Now for two soft boiled eggs, we were charged $15. TWO EGGS cut in half to make four pieces. We also ordered the kimchi stew for $24. If my mom found out I paid $24 for kimchi stew, she probably would have killed me and told me to eat it at her home. I'm not sure what makes the stew so expensive because the only ingredients in it were kimchi, radish, pork, and one measly rice cake.  I wouldn't be complaining about the price if the food was delicious, but unfortunately it was very lackluster, unbalanced, and strange. The shrimp bun was probably one of the better things we ordered that night, but it wasn't anything spectacular. The soft boiled eggs were very dense and heavy. The flavors on it were not balanced at all. The kimchi stew tasted as if they had to add MSG to make it taste better. There was literally one rice cake in my dish with some small portions of pork in it. Didn't taste authentic at all. Lastly, the chilled spicy noodles were probably the strangest dish we had. It was very basil-y and had this strange spiciness to it (it is very spicy by the way, and I love spicy foods). I feel like they added the extra heat to cover up for the lack of flavor.   Now my experience at Momofuku was very strange to me. I understand that it's Asian fusion, but it was not done very well. It always boggles my mind to see people try to make upscale Asian food because honestly, Asian (especially Korean) food is not generally high end. Korean food was created to be very strategic - to preserve and be able to survive long winters. Korean food is a mixture of a lot of scraps put together because for a long time the country was poor. Unless it was food served in the royal courts, Korean food is not necessarily fancy. Because I know this information, it was an awkward experience for me to eat at Momofuku, especially knowing that David Chang, who is the creator of the restaurant, is Korean. The food was not presented in an extraordinary way nor did the flavors blow me away. It was almost like I was ordering street food for the price of a nicer restaurant.   Overall, I probably will not come here again. It was a waste of money and the service was just average (the server forgot our drink order). Nothing at this restaurant made me want to come back again.",

Our waiter was amazingly friendly and very helpful with making sure our water was refilled and that we were enjoying our food.  Apparently they change their menus quite often, I saw a few things I wanted via Yelp photos (i.e. certain meat dishes, their soft boiled eggs dish, etc) but I was told again and again that they swapped that item out for something else. Bummer. :( I ended up ordering from the raw bar menu (it didn't even occur to me until my dish came out that it was raw). I got their Spot Prawns (4 pcs) layered on top of a cube of Anson Mills panisse (chickpea fritters), delicately showered with furikake and uni shoyu ($32.00). The flavor was delicious though, I loved the slight crunch of the furikake with the savory dab of uni shoyu on the plate. I just wasn't a huge fan of the raw prawns' texture, it was soft and very slimy. Although eating with the panisse made it tolerable and I really enjoyed the soft and fluffiness of it (almost similar to potato's texture).  Boyfriend ordered the Chilled Spicy Noodles that had Sichuan sausage, Thai basil and candied cashew ($17.00) that I found really tasty when I was picking at his dish. He also really liked the dish because it was very similar to Vietnamese flavors and reminded him of comfort food at home.  We had a great time, but I just thought it was far too expensive for a tiny meal of 4 average sized prawns for $32.00. After tax and tip, the meal for me and my boyfriend was $61.00 and I was still hungry. :/ Delicious food, but not budget friendly or that great in proportion sizes.",

The large format was such a great deal and freaking delicious. It came with oysters and sauces and butter lettuce to make wraps. Also, you can order a cake from Milk Bar and they'll deliver and cut it for your party. Such a great meal. So happy one is coming to LA.",

A bar menu did not have ramen at that time but a bartender said we could still order ramen. Rame is good and sake recommended from a bartender is also really great. Ramen, beer, and sake are great combination! Will visit here again!",

    "text": "First off this is actually 6 out 5 stars! O.o   Atmosphere:   Is just gorgeous. I love the lay out. The entrance looks like an old fashion Japanese restuarant (in which you instantly start smelling the food and start watering like a Japanese fan boy waiting for the new episode Gurren Lagann show.) with a modern twist and theres a bar to your right. (With some amazing choice of alcohol might I just add o.o just saying: your in Vegas you might as well wet your whistle with something rather than the 40s you pound behind Target on Tuesday nights with the Target staff. You know who you are..... Johnny.) A bit further to the back to the main restuarant you have this beautiful view of the strip of Vegas. The music is at ear level and conversation is simple, but with so many people it's still pretty loud but not over bearing. The lights are a bit dimmer but it works amazingly well. Giving it a relaxed vibe.  If you request the VIP lounge your walked behind to the left side down a hallway way, passing the kitchen, Into this room where you have a beautiful view of Ceasers palace water front and the view of the Eiffel Tower. (Kinda like a well groomed poodle that actually likes to be combed and doesnt run in the mud. o.o unlike some poodles. I'm looking at you Atreus [my poodle] you little rascal.) Sadly! Theres is only one bathroom in this restaurant and by god that's such a disappointment. (Cuz if you really have to go you're going to have to debate pushing some really important Douche guys that probably drive there dads Ferraris and pick up girls in the delusion that they give that their loaded. [Nice frosted tips \"Bro\"] 90s called and and they want their hair back.) The bathrooms are well cleaned and I have not seen a gang bangers writing or sharpie graffiti. Which makes me think this place is fancy ._. (They have a bidet toilet! Omg no longer do I have sit with cold bums. Bidet dont mind if I bi-doo)  Customer service:   I'm not going to lie but customer service in this place makes everyone else look like \"is this your first day owning a business and managing it??\" The times that I have come here, I have been treated amazingly. (That's to say the least! They're so nice! Like the equivalent of how cute puppies are to how amazing the service is here. AND BY GOD PUPPIES ARE FLIPPING DOLPHINS CUTE!) The staff is exceptional on recommending dishes for you. (I mean it. Hands down [hands still up] the best recommendations. Especially when I'm the worst person at deciding. Lol) They are very formal but so down to earth where you actually feel like you dont have to be so uptight. (It's a really enjoyable experience at a very nice place when people dont have silver spoons up there buttocks. Which if you think about it thats impressively hard to walk and not drop your spoon)  Food/drinks:  Better bring an empty stomach, stretchy pants and *RECOMMEND GO IN A LARGE GROUP* (NO JOKE. Unless you're an amazing eater and have a bottomless pit call \"samantha\" by god that woman could eat anything and still look fit. I hate you. Lol) There appetizers are amazing. We had there noodles and it just instantly melted in my mouth! (Probably due excessive salivation in mouth. Gross you [me] pig o.o) Speaking of pig, we did grab the roasted pig and I think someone slapped me across my face with full force of awesome flavor. Greatly seasoned and perfectly cooked. The meat literally! (I rarely use this word, due a bunch of simpletons use this word for everything.  We get it Robert your car is literally the best car... not) just fell offf the bone. (Scientist have been researching if you could make a grown man cry from pig meat and the wonderful answer is yes you can. At Momofuku.) There Sake is exquisite! (Do I sound like a DB for using that word. Lol. Cuz I feel like one.) Perfectly complimented by the meal. (I have said before that noone should go to nirvana without tasting good sake on your lips.)  I have never gotten disappointed in the meals I've had there and the food is heavenly.   Price/waiting:  You do have get a reservation for dinner but by golly even if you have to wait for an 1hour ITS WORTH THE WAIT. For price wise you're basically paying for what you're getting. (Again I would recommend going with a larger group due to the amounts of meals are a bit big and pricey. Or with a large group of street dogs that just gambled for the first time and hit the jackpot. [Yeah... dogs dont gamble.. that's not True. They beg.]) Talking with the waiter, they said that we could even call before hand and even have a budget and they'll work around with you to serve food around that budget.   Conclusion: You will not be dissatisfied with your meal, customer service and what you're paying for. I would highly reccomend this restuarant for people just stopping by at Las Vegas (I also recommend as well to always wear deodorant because noone loves peoples musk.) Make a wise choice and try it out! It LITERALLY will change your life. Haha",

    "text": "4+ stars  Day 1 of Vegas conference got off to a great start. Momofuku is classy with an urban edge and the food reflects that theme.   Recommendations:  Pork Belly Buns $7 - 5 stars and absolutely delicious. The real difference maker here is the steamed bun. It's thin, light and tasty but strong enough to hold the goods. The pork belly was extremely tender and flavored perfectly. Another big treat was the pickled cucumber which gave it a crunchy texture that you don't normally get with this kind of bunwich.  Yellowtail $21 - fresh fish and the ponzu sauce was excellent! Some of the more subtle, pickled veggies were a nice touch.   Chicken Karage Bun $7 - crispy chicken karage on the same delicious bun. I really liked this but go with the pork belly if you can only pick one.  Pork Ramen $18 - the noodle consistency is great and the flavor of the Tonkatsu broth is very good.   Oysters Momofuku $28 - these oysters are grilled and have a real smoky flavor. The final touch of chopped bacon leaves a nice aftertaste (if you're a bacon fan). I prefer fresh oysters so this was good but not great.  Service - Our server Danielle was attentive, friendly and timely.   Final verdict is go visit Momofuku at the Cosmo! It's great food with no pretense.",

    "text": "Finally a Momofuku in the West(ish) side! I'm obsessed with their NYC locations and was looking forward to being reunited with my beloved pork bunz. I've been hearing about David Chang's humble beginnings, so it's really impressive to see how far he has come.   The interior is gorgeous and the views are even better! From the outside, it looks like a small restaurant. Once you walk inside, a huge dining space opens up and you get a beautiful view of the strip.  Our group decided to order some apps, dishes and split a bo ssam. Sadly, my pork bunz were poorly put together and the meat didn't have that melt-in-your-mouth tenderness like how I remembered in NYC. Also, not cool that our server never brought out ssam sauce for us.  Our bo ssam order consisted of a slow-roasted pork shoulder accompanied with oysters, rice, bibb lettuce, kimchi and sauces. It's basically ribs and rice wrapped in lettuce. It was a lot of pork for four people, so I'd suggest splitting it with a bigger group, unless you plan on ordering bo ssam only.  Pro Tip: Make reservations in advance.",

We then discussed the menu in great depth with our server, who was patient and absolutely fantastic in giving us advice.  We then proceeded to completely over-order, getting half of the small plates as well as one of the \"2-4\" sharing dishes for 4 of us.  We loved every small plate, I could go into great detail - but just feel comfortable ordering any small plate.  As for the big dish:  the shared short ribs were absolutely fantastic.  Vegas is a land of meat, and this was the best prepared meat I've had in many trips there.  Perfectly cooked and spiced.  I've been to most of David Chang's restaurants in NYC, this completely lives up to the NYC hype.",

Made a right out of the elevators and walked down past slot machines towards the shops and restaurant signs. Eventually took escalators to the 2nd floor. You'll see Egg Slut on your left and Momofuku is just a few restaurants down on the left. Since we stayed for less than a hour, parking was free.  Made a reservation at 2:30pm on a Friday but it looked like there were still a few tables  available. Our waitress was friendly and accommodating with our limited time.  Got the shoyu pork ramen, which comes with bean sprouts, shredded pork, pork belly, and plain poached egg. The broth had a deep rich soy sauce flavor, but it was lukewarm. On the other hand, the ramen noodles were steaming hot. The differing temperatures made it dissatisfying to eat. The pork belly was nicely seared. It was a good experience to try but likely will not come back here again if ever back in the area.",

I have been meaning to try this place out for the longest time as the clout for this place is real...we ordered:  Spiced Apple Milk Punch - Alcoholic apple juice with a good quality ice cube  Spicy Fried Chicken Sandwich - There's a debate that this is the best chicken sandwich in the U.S.....it was most def good but I would put it in the Top 25 dead or alive category  Pork Ramen - $17 for a fuckin bowl of ramen is absurd but this is lowkey worth it cause you get a fat slab of pork belly and carnitas...broth is rich and everything tastes so good...top 3 ramen in Las Vegas but that price hurts....  Chilled Spicy Noodles - It's restaurants like these that allow me to try dishes I typically wouldn't try because of high quality ingredients. This was served at room temperature with the Sichuan sausage of course served warm. The pesto and basil mellowed out the slight heat coming from all the ingredients and the cashews added texture and balanced out the flavor...def a dish I would order again.  All in all this restaurant lived up to my personal expectations and granted this was social hour and not their full dinner menu....once we ballin we will go to their dinner service for sure.",

On the other hand, the dry roasted mussels and the side of crispy potatoes were both surprisingly tasty. I really like that the mussels here were different from the traditional French style with fries. They were seasoned with bits of bacon and green onion along with spices are super tasty. Good portion for the price. Potatoes were cheesy and had a good crispy bite.   In terms of drinks, we tried the sake slush, the mule, and a drink with tumeric. We liked all of them and would definitely come back for drinks.",

First, the ambiance. Very cool vibe with excellent staff, music, and decor. I love that there are three parts of the restaurant for a variety of diners. When I called to make reservations, I was sad to hear that they didn't have anything until later, but that was in their dining room. They also have seating at the bar and the front floor. We were casual, so we got a table at the front floor. The music has an edgy urban feel with a mix of some 90s hip hop greats, trip hop, and alternative. The decor is just right. Modern and alluring. Not too much.   Our server Carlos was delightful. He was friendly, fun, and funny. We had someone with us who was a bit wasted and picky, and rather than judge and be offended, he was very accommodating, interactive and welcoming to our meeting our needs. He definitely added to our great experience. You can tell that all the staff really do enjoy their job and the product/experience they are selling.   My friend and I split our buns.  - I first tried the pork belly bun. My mouth is watering thinking of this thing. I saw David Chang assemble this lovely dish on The Mind of a Chef, but nothing prepares you for the flavors. Simply delicious with pork belly that is falling apart in a savory and sweet sauce. There were picked cucumbers and another green of some sort. Divine. I then tried the chicken karaage bun. Mmm! Also delicious, but without any additional greens. It has a creamy sauce.  - For my entree, I got the pork ramen. Perfectly cooked soft boiled egg. Seasoned to perfection. Again, mouth watering just typing this up.   While writing this review, I am a little depressed because I have yet to encounter such a well-rounded positive experience here in the bay area.",

When we arrived, the host staff was friendly and accommodating, as was our server.  We were given recommendations, and I choose the Bo Ssam and Grilled Jidori Chicken as we had some friends who weren't foodie snobs like us lol. Both of those dishes were excellent and easily served way more than menu suggested. We were a party of 5 and left with lots of leftovers. I also ordered the Pork Belly Buns, because well pork belly is life and it was amazing. Our other friends ordered the dry aged ribeye and it was also delicious.  Even the birthday cake cookie Sana received was excellent! Don't think I've ever had a cookie that was so moist and delicious! Highly recommend visiting if you're in Vegas and the best part is that it's easy to get reservations! We will happily visit again next time we are in town.",

We tried the spicy cucumbers which came with almonds, spice, and scallions and was pretty refreshing. The dish was not wet considering cucumbers expel a lot of water. We also ordered two of the chicken karaage buns which came with spicy mayo and pickled red onion. We thought this was especially good.  The waiter recommended a few items that were popular for our main dish. We went with the pork ramen and the chilled spicy noodles. Both of these were ok, nothing exceptional. I was disappointed in the quality of the meat that came with my ramen. It was basically a clump of pork that wasn't fully shredded and all stuck together with lots of pockets of fat. I actually put most of aside and ate the meat that was actually shredded. Like other reviews, I agree about the smoky taste. It was interesting for a one time try and I probably wouldn't get it again. I tried the chilled spicy noodles and thought they were just ok.   For the amount of money the meal cost (I know its Vegas prices) it just wasn't worth it.",

The bartender was very nice & made good drinks (Manhattan & a vodka martini). My husband ordered pork ramen and I splurged on the Chilean seabass. We ordered drinks and waited. His ramen came out soon. Broth was good but my husband wasn't impressed. The seasoned egg was not done properly. It seemed like they just dropped a raw egg into the broth hoping it would cook. It didn't. Most of the whites were liquid. He ate the whole thing (15-20 minutes) and my food still wasn't there. I finally asked our bartender who immediately went into the kitchen to check. He seemed worried. After about 5 minutes he brought it out. This fish is over $50!!!! It was small and way overcooked. The last minute charring it received took it over the edge. What a waste of a beautiful fish and our money. This restaurant was the one my husband was looking forward to the most. He (and I) were so disappointed.",

I'm not really a fan of fusion (even less so of Asian fusion) but Momofuku does it in a way I've never seen before. My boyfriend's family brought us here twice, once for dinner and once for lunch. I definitely recommend dinner over lunch as there is a much more extensive menu. While the menu seems to change fairly often, the Rotisserie Jidori Chicken, Steamed Whole Branzino, Ginger Scallion Noodles, and Crispy Potatoes were by far my favorites. Honestly, the Crispy Potatoes are probably the best potatoes I've ever had...and I've been to Idaho! Haha. In all seriousness, the white truffle tofu sauce is the perfect balance with the Parmesan and the saltiness of the potato. What I love about Momofuku is that when taking a bite of a dish, you can immediately discern individual flavors and pairings. Simply amazing.",

This is the food that we ordered:  Appetizers: 1) Chicken Karaage - I had some pretty bomb Chicken Karraage before and Momofuku does not make my top 25 list of best Chicken Karrage.  The chicken was over seasoned, and very salty, the only saving grace was the dipping sauce that accompanied the Chicken.  I would rate this a 1 out of 5 stars.  2) Spicy Cucumbers - this was the best appetizer, the cucumber was nice and cool on such a hot summer day.  The peanuts and the seasoning was amazing.  5 out of t stars.  Buns: 1) Pork Belly Buns - Amazing 5 out of 5, I could eat 20 of these by myself.  Salads: 1) Beat Salad - Amazing 4.5 out of 5 stars.  The fresh blackberries were a great touch on this salad.  Noodles 1) Ginger Scallion Noodles - nothing special here, and not worth the price tag.  3.5 of out 5 stars.  Sides: 1) Chinese Broccoli - this was okay, this was cooked in too much lemon, all I could taste was the lemon flavor and not the Chinese Broccoli.  2.5 out of 5 stars.  Overall, the meal was mediocre at best.  The only saving grace was the service was amazing.",

The shitake mushroom buns also. The buns were the kind that you would get with duck, so folded, not filled. Very light, which I liked. This was exactly the sort of late lunch one would want.

This was good, tasty, but it was just OK! This was just a bbq pork presented with korean side dishes (kim chi, etc).Price was $100 ++ for half serving.  3. Branzino fish - this was our favorite ! Fish was completely deboned and tasty.  4. Pork Ramen - This was the worst !!! My local ramen store in San Francisco tastes much much better than David Chang's ! Broth was kinda bitter; it's hard to explain - but simply put, it was really bad. We also had 5 glasses of Gin & Tonic. Total bill $400.  Before we went there, we had a very high expectation given David Chang's extensive profile on TV. WRONG!!! It reminded me of PF Chang, not bad but nothing to write home about.   Conclusion: Too much hype ! Not worth it. Way too expensive for what it is. Now, I won't even consider checking out their store in NYC.",

It was a chill early lunch but everything was spot on from the house version of a Bloody Mary called ssam like it hot..which was fantastic to the spicy cold noodles and Brusselsprouts and cauliflower side dish. Each paired each other well and the server complimented me on the flavor profiles and the bar tender said the same that each dish is their favorite and great choices..I'd agree. I'd go back in a heartbeat.",

    "text": "While everything  we ate was fairly delicious - the meal was over shadowed by a couple of slightly annoying issues.   The prices - man - it's been said and said - but wow they are ridiculously high priced food items. We sat at the \"chefs bar\" I think it was called ?  The chef that was serving us made a comment something along the lines of -\"one of you didn't make the best choice\" .. referring to fact that I ordered a simple chick pea ramen dish ($18) due to not feeling so great - and my friend ordered the king crab noodles ($48).  It was off putting, to say the least.  Though it wasn't as off putting as hearing every conversation that the staff was having while we were trying to have our own conversation. The front of the house staff, including what appeared to be management - seemed to be going out of their way to speak loudly and over our own dining experience.  It doesn't make me want to ever go back - and I was so excited for so long to check Momofuku out. I dunno - I feel like service in Vegas has literally gone to the way of fast food with high end prices. Better luck to you !  Happy Eating : |",

    "text": "Long overdue review but had to write it because it still bothers me. Went here with another family as I heard it was pretty good. Our first waitress sat us down and was pretty nice. She told us what was good on the menu so we pretty much ordered what she recommended.   It took awhile to get our food at least for half of the party. For some reason my family's order was taking a very long time. Maybe 20 mins after our other half of the party got their food. I kept asking the other waitress that came by every now and then when our food was going to arrive. I must've asked several times but was given a very rude \"it's almost here\" response.   I kept waiting and my kids were very hungry and couldn't wait any more so I had to go ask for a manager after my attempts at getting my food was met with indifference.   The manager came out and I talked to her explaining that we waited a long ass time for our food (over 40mins) and the restaurant wasn't that busy.   The manager did not know how to handle the situation and was not apologetic at all.   Our initial waitress came out and was the only one who was apologetic and tried to fix the problem and not the manager. She is the only professional person there who tried to make the dining experience pleasant.   The food finally came out but to be honest it's really hard to enjoy it when you are pretty pissed. It could've been prepared by freakin David Chang himself but it wouldn't have placated me and my guests.   My recommendation. The food is great but definitely don't bring kids here and don't expect it to be a great dining experience.   I'm giving it two stars because of the cool waitress and decent food as it would've been a one star rating due to horrible management and one of the servers being a total @&$$!",

    "text": "The boyfriend and I came in here because we are fans of David Chang from food TV shows, we hadn't the opportunity to actually try his food. So this was such a treat to be in Vegas and experience his food.   We came in for dinner, but we were seated in the front/bar area which was away from the main dining rooms. According to my boyfriend, the decor was more upscale and it had some awesome window views.   Dinner menu options are more of family style. I can't comment on the portions or taste, but the prices were pretty crazy. I think an entree order of short ribs was priced at over $100, which was way out of our budget. We like David Chang for his experience with noodles, especially ramen. So we both ordered Pork Ramen.   The ramen was good... for a soup. The broth doesn't really hit home as \"ramen\" in my opinion. The noodles were cooked well. There was shredded pork, charred pork belly (this was the best part of the entire meal), and a poached egg rather than soft boiled egg. The portion was a bit small, but noodles are always filling. All this for $18, but I personally felt like it was a $12-14 bowl of soup. I guess you're paying for the decor/environment as well as your food. But being that we weren't seated in the nicer area it made it pointless to have to shell out $18 for a bowl of soup.   Service was whatever. For an upscale restaurant, I find it tacky when servers constantly try to upsell their customers. Every time our server came to check on us, he opened conversation with: \"Ok are we ready for a round of shots?\" to refill waters: \"So how about those tequila shots?!\" I only wish I had the woman-balls to tell him to chill with his try-hard pants.   So here I am, full, but wondering why the heck am I fan of David Chang.",

Everything was flavourful, the meats practically melted in our mouths with how tender everything was, and service was top notch! Our water glasses never reached less than half full.   We sat at the kitchen bar and got to talk to the kitchen staff, and watched how stuff was cooked. Shout out to the chefs who were very attentive, noticing that we started on our ramen and buns first, and asked if we'd like them to keep our short ribs warm for us, and then getting us more gravy (and heating up our meat too!) when we ran a little low on it in the ribs.   We had planned on getting dessert from the milk bar after dinner, but the portions were so generous that we were fully stuffed and couldn't manage any more food at all even though i was dying to try the cereal milk soft serve. We had an amazing time and I spent the next hour texting all my friends to hurry up and eat here when they get to Vegas.   I really look forward to eating here again the next time I'm in town!",

Sorry, I'm a local mom with littles so it's hard to haul them out all the time for some delicious baos a and milk cream. But any time I'm out on the strip or at the cosmo a stop at momofuku is a must. The shrimp & carafe naps as delicious. Both are decent size and the the spicy sauce they serve on the side is a perfect complement. I always get a yuzu lemonade. If you're really hungry the Kastu is delicious but super heavy & savory. Due to this it is too much for one person, definitely something to share. This past visit, they just started serving single servings of heir famous birthday cake. Which is a huge serving (enough for 2/3). The cake looks like it would be super sweet but it is perfect balance of sweetness. It's almost like a pound cake consistency. The swirl milk cream is delicious. I usually get fruity/original swirl with crunch or sprinkles. This place is nice for date night, groups or solo dining. They have a bar & counter tables and a formal dining area. I would bring kids here for an early dinner but anything later start to get filled with party/club goers.",

    "text": "I understand the mystique of David Chang but the truth is this restaurant could be great but suffers from a lack of love and careful execution.  The menu is weirdly skewed to larger dishes for 4 or more people, so if it's just the two of you, your choices are severely limited.  We've been here three times now, twice as a couple and once with a large group.  The large group experience was great because we could enjoy a few of the large plates, but as a just a couple we had too few choices.  To walk through some of the items we enjoyed, A5 Hokkaido Wagyu Potatoes were good but a really heavy, rich choice as a small plate.  Seemingly counter to the Asian feel of the rest of the menu and if that's Wagyu beef, shaving it and obliterating it like that is a waste of great meat.  Pork Belly Buns were good, but didn't stand out.  Shrimp Buns are quite good, don't miss them.  Same with Chilled Spicy Noodles, really good! Several of the large plates are great, even remarkable, but all serve a minimum of 3 people and most serve 4 or more.  So without a large party, you lose. Our large party enjoyed Salt and Pepper Lobster and Shrimp, and also 5 Spice Rotisserie Duck and the Bo Saam slow roasted pork.  So bring 8 of your closest friends and enjoy the pricy large plates.  For fewer people than that it's a forgettable experience.",

    "text": "Momofuku definitely seems Vegas-sized as compared to a typical David Chang Momofuku. Prices are 15-20% higher than they should be.  However, the restaurant itself really has the flair of a Cosmo locale and the inside area with noodle bar and restaurant are really exquisite.  Momofuku Vegas offers opportunity for tapas-style experience, like I had, or a family meal.  The menu has multiple buns, some ramen (though off-menu during dinner, can still be ordered), noodles, and large plates.  The bun exterior is fantastic, chewy goodness, while the shrimp and chicken innards underwhelmed as compared to the perfectly cooked and large pork belly bun.  Couple in some ssam sauce, which has a nice kick but won't burn your mouth, and you got a winner.  The ramen noodles were perhaps the bestin town.  The broth was less flavorful or spicy than I was hopingbut still very good.  As far as the soup accompaniments, the meat was the best in town, as it should be at $18 a bowl.  It included some ground pork and pork belly.  But the veggies were just average in the soup.  The shishito peppers were a niceappetizer as well.  Drinks weer fine and Asian-infused, but nothing spectacular, especially at about $17 each.  Overall it's a very good meal but I was not blown away.  You can get out of there at a very affordable or a very expensive meal depending on your feeling, which is nice in Vegas, as your pocket can stay intact even with good food.",

I was super excited to hear they opened a restaurant at the Cosmopolitan! I came here right when they opened and got seated right away at 11am for lunch. They offer selections such as chickpea ramen, truffle ramen, even cold noodles! I went for the pork ramen which comes with a poached egg, a slice of pork belly, scallions and sprouts. For $18 is a bit steep, but I have to admit the quality of the ramen was pretty darn good. The broth was to die for, especially after a night of drinking and going out. I was also happy to find that the broth wasn't the typical creamy pork broth I'm used to in SF, but a clear broth which made it all enjoyable. The ingredients were fresh and noodles were perfect texture and taste! Service was super fast and they were able to expedite my experience because I was in a bit of a time crunch.   Next time I'll definitely try the pork belly buns and get their cereal milk soft serve next door! Prices are a bit expensive but as the only Momofuku restaurant on the west coast I don't mind spending a little extra for the food and experience here.",

    "text": "After years of having heard about the NYC location, we finally got to try Momofoku in Vegas.  Having read a lot about the menu, we went with both the pork and chicken buns for an appetizer along with some sashito peppers and mashed potatoes.  The buns were good, the peppers were great, and the mashed potatoes were divine.  Our group was split about whether pork or chicken bao was better, but you can't go wrong getting both.    For main courses for 5 people, we got the half Bo Ssam and the branzino.  The Bo Ssam was delicious and more than enough for us--your mileage may vary with the size of the half order.  The branzino was just \"eh\" for us.  I'm not a big fish eater and it tasted fishy to me.  Those in our group that eat more fish agreed, but no one was terribly impressed with it--especially next to the Bo Ssam.    For dessert we got crack pie, cereal milk, fruity cereal milk, and birthday cake truffles.  The cake truffles were great.  The crack pie was another \"eh\" and the ice cream hit the spot as usual.  Atmosphere was great.  The wall art is awesome and music was good.  It was loud, but not too loud.  Service was outstanding and we'll definitely be coming back.",

Meat was tender and side were extra tasty! It was a fun dining experience. It was quite dark in the dinning area, a little too dark for my taste. I suggest dinning with at least 4 people, so you can share something from the format menu or just order several plates to share. Definitely want to go again and try something else. Love the mix of cultures in each plate.",

    "text": "The staff was very accommodating for our large party of 15 (this included one child and one baby).  Even though we were about 45 minutes to and hour late, they still held our table, though they told us that this would cut into how long we had to sit, which was fine by us.  We initially had three different reservations but somehow, we got lucky and they were able to put one extra table with the larger one so we could all be seated together.  Score!    Food itself was disappointing as I had wanted to eat here (or the one in NYC) for a long time.  Ramen at $17 or $18 for a small bowl was definitely not worth it - Daikokuya and Santouka still remain my two favorites.  We also ordered the Korean Short Ribs, which cost like $250!!  It was crazy expensive.  The meat was super tender but we each got like one or half a piece.  Crazy.  It's supposed to feed 6-8 but it is still way too expensive - again, getting this in Ktown is easier on the wallet and tastes better.  Lobster was okay - nothing special.  I did like the pork buns, which you order by the piece, and not sure it was worth $7 each.  Someone ordered some kind of noodle dish, which we barely touched.  It ended up being $110 pp, which was way too much for food that none of thought was great.  Overall food/price would be two stars but I gave them another star for the service.  Also, their cocktail menu is pretty limited - I didn't see anything I liked so I just asked the bar to make me something, which turned out fine.  I still love the cookies, though, which you can buy next door.",

We ordered the spicy cucumbers which literally was cucumber with a bit of spice peppers on top. Another starter was the butter potatoes that were overly salted. I got an old fashioned and I barely tasted any of the flavors. The ramen was terrible honestly. First, the broth tasted like the piece of pork belly, burnt meat. Then, the noodle texture tasted like an instant noodles you can get at the dollar store. Overall, I was disappointed with the food. The only plus was great service.

Wish it wasn't so much but was really good. Disappointed in the Pork Ramen. The flavoring wasn't too my liking. It tasted a little too oily to my liking and not as thick of a broth, but hey you can't win them all. But if anything at least order the pork belly boa.",

    "text": "On this trip, I looked forward to trying this restaurant the most. The pork belly lived up to all its hype. Everything else was beyond disappointing  Of the three ramen we tried, the pork ramen was the best. Keep in mind, that's relative to our other dishes. We also tried the $58 bowl of black winter truffle. I liked how the truffle added a different layer of flavor to the broth, but the noodle used really ruined the bowl for me. The noodle is not the traditional, curly ramen noodle. Instead, it was bit thicker and the texture was hard, which made it almost resistant to the broth it swam in. The chicken shiitake ramen was the worst of the three ramen. I can't even describe the mushroom sauce that devoured the chicken katsu patty. Why?!? The pork belly buns were very tasty and the only thing that left me wanting more. We ordered a side of the pork belly since the buns were so delicious. We wanted to enjoy it with our ramen bowls. The dish came out at the end of our meal when we were done with our noodles. The food service was very disappointing. The restaurant was more than half empty. The table next to us arrived after but finished their meal before our noodles even arrived. The kitchen seemed disorganized. Our noodles came out at different times. I'm so disappointed. I really wanted to fall in love. The cookies  from Milk Bar sort of made up for some of my disappointment but not enough for me to ever return. The dishes did not blow me away. I don't think I even swayed.   Quick tip: get the pork ramen and pork buns. Skip the rest.",

    "text": "As a resident in LV, I was super stoked to try the long awaited Momofuku for dinner. David Chang is known for his umami style of cooking, really toning into the harmonious aspects of food/ dish design. Went in with very high expectations & food-wise they were met!  Menu is large, nicely broken into small plates & larger main entrees w/ a la carte side options. There was a salad section (looked underwhelming), a bun section, a raw bar section, small bites section, noodle/ramen section & a main entree section w/ additional side section.  Made a res. for 2 aware of what kinks/shortfalls might occur due to it being opening night. Got seated right away after being 5 mins late, & brought a bottle of our own wine from our collection ($50 corkage per btl, 2 btl max). Cool strip view, & funky interior. Our waitress was so friendly!  The waitress explained that on the noodles/ramen section the Noodles were served room-temperature & drier while the Ramen options was served very hot & in broth.  Decided not to order any salads/small bites, instead focusing on the buns, raw bar, ramen, main entrees & side dishes. Order two pork belly buns, a white fish sashimi (forget name) in a citrus vinaigrette w/ plum, the black truffle ramen, dry aged prime rib, a whole branzino, & the pommes puree.  Pork belly (fatty) buns came out right away & were taco style (I prefer when the buns are shaped as a ball that is filled versus a taco shell that is stuffed). The actual bun was amazing; great texture & flavor. The pork belly came in 3 pieces of pork (vs. shredded) was seared to perfection. My boyfriend had 3 pieces of pork belly that looked well seared & delicious (he finished it), but my bun had 2 pieces of pork that were way overly fatty & under-cooked. I had one delicious piece (truly enough for me) & dish was okay overall.  From the raw bar the sashimi came out. The fish tasted extremely fresh & the flavors from the plums & citrus really highlighted the sashimi. Wanted more plum.  Soon after a food runner came by to present the black truffle Ramen. Food runner presented the ramen & informed us it was the pork belly ramen... We informed the food runner this was not our dish... He proceeded to count out the table numbers out loud, & ask us if we were sure this was not our dish... We informed him we were sure, & that we had ordered the black truffle ramen. He whisked it back into the kitchen, while our waitress came by to present the ramen utensils/bowls. She looked puzzled why the Ramen had not been presented to the table. We informed her of the mix-up & she asked us if we wanted the original dish? (I thought this was a strange question but my boyfriend said she was just being polite due to time delay), which we confirmed we definitely did still want the truffle dish. She said she would rush the ticket & apologized again for the mix-up.  This is when the service started to hit some shortfalls. *I attribute this solely to the fact it was opening night & I truly believe that a kitchen/restaurant deserves a solid month after opening before you can meticulously judge/grade service.*   On both sides of us the couples were either presented with incorrect items, or they were waiting exceptionally long to receive the next course. Guests seemed really on edge, both sides of the close quartering tables were chattering about how terrible the service was. The FOH floor/staff looked calm & so did the BOH open kitchen, but the Managers scurried around tending to guest complaints of time delays & incorrect/missing items.   Whole branzino came out next. Beautiful presentation & was left for us to pick/debone ourselves. No small bones like expected, making it very easy and enjoyable to eat. Fresh fish & citrus notes made for a great dish.   Rib-eye with marrow butter came out & was absolutely phenomenal. Cooked perfectly & not overly fatty the rib-eye was seasoned with onions/mushrooms & blew away the fish (so strange for me to say).   Pommes puree (mashed potatoes) was literally Joel-Robuchon-status good & made me want to lick the bowl clean & ask for another portion(s). This accompanied the rib-eye & truly made me forget we were still waiting for the black truffle ramen dish.  Waitress came back out to apologize once again for wait on black truffle ramen. We asked to see the wine list & were surprised by pricing (not huge mark-up) & a good base selection. (XL wine-cellar promises future advancements to this).  Got a btl of old world Chard ( really great somm.) & the black ramen truffle finally arrived! It was worth the wait!! Truly delicious & interesting (spanish black truffles). Exactly the taste of umami to me. Great ending to meal!  Overall the service was major short-fall due to long wait time, but the food was killer, & staffing was polite, friendly & knowledgeable.. really what more could you ask for on opening night?!  Sadly did not see famous fried chix. on menu.  Large format menu looks like fun place for a group!!   We will be back!!",

    "text": "Dinner was good.   It's pretty much family style. They have the large style dining menu that is essentially just a really expensive large entree to share. The large entrees start at $188 per plate. The smallest serving 2-4 people, up to 4-8 person dishes. The most expensive being $1499, fish with caviar, if I remember correctly.    We opted to do 2 \"smaller\" entrees, to give ourselves more variety. Each of the two were meant to serve 2 people. With 4 adults and 3 kids with us, this seemed the better route.   We got the Salt n Pepper Lobster and Shrimp, which tasted like your typical Salt n Pepper Crab, just with Lobster and Shrimp. A peel and eat dish.  Not a big Lobster fan, but this lobster was sweet and moist. The Shrimp also very tasty. A little kick on the outside but not too much that the kids couldn't have a bite of the inside. Served on a bed of fried jalepenos and hot peppers. $99. Definitely fed 4 adults, we were getting full toward the end.   The Salmon Steak was our second dish, $50. Salmon was pan seared, a little rare on the inside. A really big slice. Pretty good, nothing to write home about. The kids loved it though.   The Pork Belly buns - delicious! So fatty and tasty, melt in your mouth goodness. $7 each. Should have gotten more of these.  Plain pork ramen for the kids. Regular ramen was going to be spicy. This was literally just pork broth and ramen. $15. ($2 less than Regular). If I'm going to pay $15 for my ramen, it's going to have pork belly, soft boiled melty egg, 36 hour stewed broth... This? For the kids? I should have known better.   Service was great. Forgot his name, but he liked us, we liked him. I tipped well, since he doesn't set the prices.  We were full. Almost couldn't finish. We forced ourselves to though, given the price.   All is said and done, $250.   Good experience. A little overpriced for what is was, but then again, it is Vegas. Nice ambiance. The bathrooms have bidets and the toilets are blue.",

Tasty, but loaded with carbs and cholesterol...  As a healthy eater, I wished they had a choice with leaner pork. Some people love melting fat in their mouth, but not me.   I went with a healthy entree - Miso Black cod. It was just too sweet for me.  Japanese style, I guess. Being a fan of authentic Korean spicy cod soup, I wished it was less sweet and had a little red chili or something. It liked it better than Nobu's black cod, but it's not really my style.   And we had this weird smoked pumpkin, which I couldn't even swallow.  The long shaped pumpkin slices were too hard to cut with a knife or to bite into with my teeth. The black sauce coating the pumpkin was strong, too salty, and almost tasted like medicine. I can't imagine how anyone could like it.",

The restaurant is in the Cosmopolitan Hotel on the 2nd floor behind the huge Chandelier.   The space is huge with great views looking out at the Paris Hotel along the strip.   Our server, Dale, was super fun, attentive and full of positive energy. She told us about the tuna poke special that's mixed with concentrated pluots and shaved freezed foie gras. Umm, hook line and sinker!  I didn't even ask how much it was going to bleed me.  $38 FYI. I took the hit for you so you don't have to awkwardly decline upon knowing the price when there.  It was worth it to me. The shaved freezed foie gras was creamy, slightly salty and rich at the same time and the pluots added the subtle sweetness to the well marinated tuna.  We also got the pork ramen $18, oysters on a half shell ($26), pork belly buns and the shrimp bun($7 & $8 each, respectively).  Although the ramen wasn't on the dinner menu, Dale was sweet to ask the kitchen to whip it up. Unfortunately, I wasn't blown away by it.  The oysters came with melon and lime shaved ice chips on top that had a vodka? tinge to it that IMO was completely unnecessary. It overpowered the delicious sweet oysters underneath.   The pork belly buns, which I saved for last, made my tummy and mouth happy.  Don't bother getting the shrimp bun, pork belly all the way.  Finally, I had to try the famous Milk birthday cake ($14/generous slice). Umm, maybe I was expecting too much, but it just tasted like any cake I could've baked at home. It was a little dry without much surprise or decadence like their crack pie or compost cookie.   Great service from Dale deserves 5 stars, but alas, the misses took it down 2 Stars.  I don't think I'll be craving momofuku in awhile.",

We were a party of 12, went without a reservation on a Monday night around 7p, and were seated within minutes.  Our waiter was probably my favorite waiter ever.  HILARIOUS.  We loved him.  (Server on my check says \"Mags\", I don't remember that being his name.)  Since we had so many people we got to try a lot of things.  Everything was a highlight but the \"don't miss\" dishes for me were:  Hamachi Shishito Peppers Ham tasting (OMG!)  Grits Asparagus (I know, right?  it was the best asparagus I've ever eaten.) Potatoes (there were 4 sides, we ordered them all, they were all exceptional)  Other things to mention:  The whole Branzino - delicate and beautifully prepared (and they left the head off at our request, thanks!)  Jidori chicken (nothing exciting, it's chicken .. put the Jidori in front of it, it's still chicken.  Order something else.) Dry Aged Ribeye - this sucker was $85.00 it came sliced for easy sharing, and let me tell you, I couldn't have eaten more than a couple of slices.  It was DIVINE, but so so rich.   I'd go back, and I've recommended this place to so many people already (so don't screw up!)   On the \"could use improvement side\" - Beer selection was weak and they really don't serve dessert, they send you \"Milk\" which is fine.  They could have gotten us dessert from there.  We ended up not doing dessert at all, so lost opportunity.    We had a blast.",

Buns - not bad but nothing exceptional. Most were over sauced or salted, the shiitake was recommended but the added flavor really overpowered the mushrooms (nice texture though).  Fish cake one I would actually recommend.  EXPENSIVE considering I can swing by and have chairman bao in the bay  2. Ramen - mediocre.  3. Szechuan noodles - inedible. I love Sichuan food and this was not sichuan in any way!  The green sauce was WAY too spicy and had none of the peppercorn mala flavor signature of Sichuan food.  The sausage was ok but lacked any complex flavor just salty  4. Brussel sprouts - not bad but the ones at rose. rabbit. lie were better.  For how much I paid for this meal I was really expecting something exceptional with complex flavors but this was the worst meal of my Vegas trip.  Save yourself a trip here and just catch an uber/lyft to Monzo and get a bowl of handmade udon.  You'll be much more satisfied.",

The couple we were with also shared a ramen bowl.  The ramen was fantastic. Very porky broth, the pork shoulder and belly in the ramen was cooked perfectly and was delicious. It was hard for me to share it. The mushroom bun was also good but the star was the ramen.  The ambience is also pretty cool. From the high top we were sitting at if you look towards the back of the restaurant you could see the windows with all the light up signs outside and it really looked like a scene out of blade runner or something. I dunno I got a kick out of that.  I can't go 5 stars because of the price and the drink I had was meh. Had an old fashioned but the bourbon used or something was not that good. At $16 I expected better bourbon. 2 ramen bowls, 1 bun and 4 drinks was over $100.  Would come back just for the ramen.",

The service here was really good at the beginning and middle of the meal, but when it came time to wrap up we had to flag a different waiter because our server didn't stop by anymore (nbd).  We ordered the duck (smaller portion), pork shout ramen, and two pork buns.  The pork buns were deliciously fatty and rich. Personally, it's worth one but I don't think I could handle another.  The shoyu ramen had a similar pork belly as the pork bun as well as shredded meat (i think pork as well). The soft boiled egg was beautiful and large in the ramen. I really enjoyed the broth as it wasn't too oily and the right amount of flavor for me and the noodles had a good amount of bite to it.  When the duck came it looked beautiful. The amount of meat in each piece was pretty sizable. However, because of the thickness some pieces were a little more rare and led to being too chewy. The skin of the duck was also not crispy. I believe this dish is supposed to be eaten in a lettuce or pancake wrap, but personally the flavors get lost while doing so. I rather eat each component by itself or pair it with the rice it comes with.  Side note- something that threw me off was we were charged for water. Good thing I drank 4 glasses!",

Both are good but I think the pork bun is definitely the best. You need to make reservation to get in here and I went here for dinner. I think this place is kind of overpriced. I was here with 10 people and we spent around $70 per person. I think this is way overpriced for Asian food. This restaurant is located beside Milk Bar and you should definitely try the ice cream there.",

I ordered three different items: The Shoyu Pork Ramen $17; Kona Kampachi $26; Brussel Sprouts and Cauliflower $10  1. The Shoyu Pork Ramen: This had some really good elements put together. The pork belly was tender, and it had a nice outer crust that held it's shape together. You can also taste the pork meat itself that they also give and its not tainted with any other flavors. The noodles have a nice bouncy, and chewy texture to them. I would just rather have a soft boiled egg than a poached egg. The poached egg doesn't work. The shoyu broth wasn't very strong it was very light. Hard to tell whether they want the pork to be highlighted but broth is always important in Ramen.   2. Kampachi: I don't think this was really worth 26 dollars. The fish was fresh and clean. However this thick bacon ponzu sauce had such a strong smokey flavor in it; it just overpowered the fish. It would've worked much better if the ponzu and more zest was highlighted but it just doesnt sit well with me.   3. Brussel Sprouts: It's such a common ingredient to be used now in most restaurants but I think this was the one I really liked the most. The fish sauce gives it a nice salty, umami flavor with a good amount of heat.   Momofuku is the place you go to eat, just to say you've been there. Overall its pretty pricey, but then again everything in vegas is pricey.",

Comes with a lot of meat - pork belly + pork shoulder, slow poached egg, nori, bean sprouts. $17 - Pork Belly Bun: also so so tasty - huge piece of melt-in-your-mouth pork belly, hoisin, cucumbers, scallions. $7 - Shrimp Bun: amaaaazing - shrimp with spicy mayo, pickled red onion, lettuce. $7  All the food was delicious and perfectly cooked. I wish I got to try some of the other dishes, but they were out of our price range lol.  Service - 3 stars Got seated quickly at a bar seat. Someone came by quickly to give us fancy water, but after that it took a while to get someone's attention to order. We went on a Monday, but still... pretty slow. On the menu, it says they charge $1 for unlimited water, but we didn't get a charge?  Definitely would come back here.... amazing amazing food, though I didn't see anything peach-related, unless I missed it? I was hoping for a yummy drink lol.",

    "text": "So it is what it is, eating on the strip you do expect a hefty price tag, especially with Momofuku being a well established restaurant in the realm previously.   I will say their veggie chickpea ramen is by far the best vegetarian ramen i've had. The spicy cucumbers, eh they were ok, I honestly thing for what youre paying for them they could be prepared better, it reminds me of a traditional korean dish but just not mixed, they mix the cucumbers with what I believe is rice vinegar and then garnish it with a little red pepper flake, I would prefer it mixed together but thats me. Crispy potatos were not bad, but i wasn't particularly diggin the sauce they were served with.   I like that you can order milk bar to your table, as there isn't much places to sit down and enjoy your ice cream elsewhere, overall solid restaurant again. I've only tried their lunch but maybe I will swing by for dinner sometime",

We ended up getting the Kampachi which was fishy and bland. The asparagus which was good, the sweet potatoes which were good, but not amazing. For an \"entree\" I got the beef noodles. They were filling, but not something I would normally get at a high end restaurant.",

Their pork belly buns were amazing and I couldn't get enough of them. Only reason why I did not give a 5 star is because sometimes it was hard to wave down the server or bring over the check. It did take a very long time but luckily the food made up for most of it. They were very quick with refilling water and there was never an empty cup.",

    "text": "This is my third time here and I am now completely in love with Momofuku!   Coming in at 12:30pm on a Thursday there was no wait at all and we were promptly seated.  Tried the truffle ramen (don't think this is on the menu anymore) last summer and thought it was good but not something I would come back for. Then in winter I tried the scallion noodles as well as the shishito peppers. I loved the shishito peppers but the scallion noodles weren't really for me (though my boyfriend enjoyed these). But this time around, everything we ordered was absolutely amazing - I'm actually craving all of it as I write this!   Chilled Spicy Noodles (w/ added poached egg): Wow oh wow is this delicious! So nice and refreshing with a very bright and fragrant flavor. The light saltiness of the sausage paired really well with the sweetness from the sauce. On top of that, the noodles were perfectly cooked & had a great chew. Would like to mention that I didn't find this spicy at all so don't be deterred by the name of you can't handle spice. Now onto the famed poach egg, I kind of regret ordering one - I'd rather have ordered 10. The yolk is AMAZING! Teetering on the edge of cooked and runny it was so thick and delicious, I just wanted a whole bowl of eggs... With that said, it worked really well mixed in with the noodles!   Shishito Peppers: We couldn't help but order this again. Simple but so addicting!   Pork Belly Bun: A great appetizer (or meal if you order 2-3 a person depending on how big your appetite is). The pork belly is so nice and succulent and tastes great with the hoisin and scallion. I also really enjoyed the pickled cucumber!   Crispy Potatoes: We ordered this side thinking that we wouldn't be full off the above three (we were wrong and left with a lot of leftovers) & because we thought these might be similar to the raved about butterball potatoes at Majordomo in LA. I honestly have no idea if this side is remotely similar but who cares because this might be my favorite dish. The potatoes are perfectly crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside with this amazing honey mustard sauce. I don't really remember what else was in it, all I know is that this is so packed with flavor and so delicious!!   As for the space, it's inside Cosmo, is relatively large, and offers a great view of the strip because of its large windows.   Service was friendly and attentive as expected. Great explanations were given of each dish as it was delivered to the table. Waters were refilled for us even though they do leave the bottle at the table for you. We didn't have to wait long for the check. Everything just flowed right!   For pricing, I honestly thought it was really worth it for what we ordered. The portions were all quite large aside from the bun and the flavors were exemplary. We left with leftovers and all of this only costed us $60 after tax and tip which is honestly really good in Vegas for a meal of such good quality.   I will definitely be back the next time I'm in Vegas!",

I wanted to try this place and it being in the cosmopolitan I knew it was going to be semi swanky. I didn't find it crazy fancy inside which is good and we sat at a table with a revolving top. Server was excellent and everyone enjoyed their food. I got the garlic noodles, spicy cucumbers and pork belly bun. I was so full and honestly could have ate two of those buns they are so delicious  We went for lunch so I assume dinner is different menu a little bit. I am rarely in Vegas but if I find my way back I would go here again. I'll definitely hit the nyc ones as it's been a while",

My ramen was pretty salty (took a star down for the saltyness). Pork belly buns were good. The boiled egg with roe was ok. Crack pie was good, cereal and milk ice cream wasn't anything exciting, cookie was good.  The service was actually pretty bad. As I look around to see other servers attentive to their customers, explaining their meals & menu, ours was gone, eating in back, she took forever filling up our waters, and wasn't really helpful with the menus for my friends who never ate here before. She wasn't really inviting and was prob over her shift. ( took a star down for the service)  Ambience was cool.  Overall, it felt \"fusion\" to me. If I want some legit ramen, I'll head over to Chinatown, maybe hit up a Japanese restaurant, with legit Japanese cooks, where I know service in Japanese restaurants are always inviting and half the cost.  I am editing the post because the manager Ricalynn kindly reached out to me in regards to our experience and sent a nice care package ( which I really appreciate and did not expect). Like any business, it's great to see someone reach out to a customer who did not enjoy a good experience. Raised the rating for reaching out to us. Thank you for the package & we hope to visit again.",

The pork bun was my favorite.  Would have gotten the pork ramen had i had known how good the pork would be earlier. Oysters were small but i appreciated the sauce on top. Friendly service.",

Not amazing but good, but I don't want to spend on a lot of money on \"good.\"   We had the pork buns, shiitake mushroom bun, chicken karage bun and the momofuku oysters. The buns were great but nothing special about them to me. Same with the oysters. Surprisingly loved the fried Brussels sprouts but they are only a side dish, not a main.   Finally, the crack pie. This was my main reason for coming here. This may have been extremely over hyped for me but I thought for how small the dessert was, that it would be unforgettable and packed with flavor,  but I just didn't get that. Nothing I would rave about the way everyone does. Don't get me wrong, all round the food is great.. but I wouldn't say it's worth all the raving reviews. Would definitely try  it again to get different entrees because maybe I'm missing some amazing dish? Customer service excellent. Vibe is casual, trendy and old school hop music throughout dinner.

First of all, the atmosphere was perfect with windows surrounding the dining area for great lighting all around, music loud and quiet enough to have a good conversation, and an overall simple yet classy feel. The staff were all so welcoming as every person we passed greeted us hello and bye. Our server was informative and friendly and all other staff were just as friendly and attentive!  We initially ordered the pork belly bun, shrimp bun, and the ssam with the five spiced rotisserie duck. The buns were so tender and tasty and the ssam was amazing! The duck provided was well seasonwd, not greasy, and with thick slices of meat! My boyfriend who is Korean said that the kimchee was prepared perfectly regarding the spices and how it was fermented.   We also must have come on a great day because we were also given complimentary brussel sprouts & cauliflower (unexpectedly so flavorful and possibly the best brussel sprouts we have ever had) and the spicy cucumbers (refreshing, light, delicious).  The dessert comes from next door at Milk. They have unique flavors and it was nice end of our meal!",

While the Momofuku Resturant was a great late night bite that filled our cravings, it fell a little short of my expectations. Maybe it was the limited late night menu? I wanted to try the Ramen, and it was okay. Good enough for regular Ramen, but not blown out the water Ramen. My boyfriend had the Chicken Katsu rice bowl and he liked it. I felt like the ginger taste in the gravy was a little too strong. I like that it had veggies though! The meatball bahnwhich was too spicy for me, and I put the sauce on the side. (I'm really sensitive when it comes to spicy food). My favorite dish was the Shrimp Bao! Loved that it came in a patty form and the bread was to die for! When I come back, I would get the Bao for sure, maybe in every flavor!   It was nice we could order dessert for the milk bar next door too. I have a big sweet tooth and I would come here just to get the dessert. I love the gluten-Free / Dairy Free Kolosses cookies! The coco was so soft and moist with the maple and coconut! My boyfriend got the Milkshake with the crunchy cereal but said next time we would not get the cereal in it because it was a little too much. Lastly I got some cookies in a cute tin to-go to take to family and friends. The Tin kept it from getting smashed in my luggage. Can't wait to come back!",

    "text": "OMG MOMOFUKU IS IN VEGAS!!! The name is so freakin' cute. This was our first food stop after checking in and dropping off our stuff. By the time we arrived it was late night happy hour and there were two seats at the bar with our names on them! We ordered the drinks right away. The white Cosmo slushie sounded cute and yummy so we ordered that and it was half off. It was so refreshing and delicious. For food, we ordered the shishito peppers, the pork ramen, and the ginger scallion noodles, and the pork belly bun. All the food was tasty. The pork belly bun came out first and it was gooooood. It always is though. The server brought the essential ssam sauce for us to eat it with. The shishito peppers were good too but I think it would've been even better without the powder sprinkled on top of it. Sometimes simple is more. Just a little olive oil and salt! Watch out for those random spicy ones. The ramen was good (but I've had better ramen elsewhere - it's not the best). The ginger scallion noodles were really tasty - it comes with shiitake mushrooms, cucumber and wakame and it's a cold noodle dish. It was simple flavoring but refreshing. I would totally get this again. I also added ssam sauce to it!   We ordered two more rounds of the slushie. Our last one was right at closing time, so our amazing server brought it to us on a to go cup so we didn't have to down it. So thoughtful! Overall good food, yummy drinks, great service, and typical trendy ambience. Perfect addition to Cosmo's dining options!",

    "text": "I visited previously on the second day of the soft open. As one might expect from a venue just two days old, the service, flow, and food timing were shaky, at best.  Fast forward a little over a month: I CAME BACK.   Boom. That, my friends, is really all you need to know. I came back for more. I came back after having tried everything on my \"must order\" list. Why does this matter? It matters because I very rarely make a return visit to \"big name\" venues. There are too many other places to experience to make return visits to places where I've seen, tried, and tasted.   So, why did I come back?  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  FOOD.   I'll be honest. I came in wanting, deep down inside, to walk out hating the food. I wanted my experience to be a living testament to the idea that overrated food is running rampant and that no one's stomach would ever be satisfied by chasing menu items as seen on the gram. That said, even on day two, I had no complaints. The food was all prepared well; good temperature, deep flavors, and balanced textures. The pork ramen, while not the best ramen I've ever had (hey, I have my biases), was still worthy of the notoriety. The broth was clean, clear, and very tasty and the egg was made for yolk porn. On the second visit, I switched up and ordered the chicken noodle soup because it had me at chicken schmaltz. When I was a kid, my family used to drive to Torrance, to a small strip mall to have chicken mami soup (shout out to my fellow pinoys). The Momofuku soup stirred up memories of that soup. Clear, richly chicken-y broth paired with the perfect choice noodle topped with moist chunks of chicken.   Baos are all great. And I typically hate baos. I grew up eating Filipino siopao and was often guilty of digging the filling out of the overly dense bread. The baos are all beautifully steamed and pillowy. All 4 options offer a perfect mix of all flavors and textures in each bite. The pork belly left nothing to be desired, but the shrimp was a surprise treat. I suggest these as top two choices, followed by the karaage and the mushroom.   However, the standout dish, by far, is the chicken katsu. I know the pie at the neighboring Milk Bar bears crack in its name, but the crack is clearly actually in the katsu gravy. On the first visit, we ordered the entree and split it amongst a party of 4. One the second visit, the katsu was also offered in a bowl presentation on a bed of rice with bok choy and thinly sliced pickled cucumber. I was assured that the gravy remained the same. Personally, I preferred the bowl option because adding a bowl of rice for $4 to the entree crosses some moral lines for me (and tempts me to bring a bag of rice in my purse).   ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  SERVICE  The service was spotty on the first visit, but this was to be expected. I am happy to report that none of the hiccups experienced a month ago were even remotely existent this week. In fact, I was continually \"freaked out\" by how on top of things the staff were. There was one point where I took the last bite of a bao, turned to the right to say something to my husband, looked up and went, \"where'd the steamer basket go?!\". My water glass was never empty but I never really remember seeing anyone come to fill it. Unspoken service is very apparent here as I don't recall ever having to ask for anything other than for the server to take my credit card while our friends were in the restroom so we could cover the tab.   ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ATMOSPHERE  Restaurant has a great view, great light (ahem - very instaworthy), and great location.   Oh, be sure to use the restroom. Be sure everyone in your party uses the restroom.  Pricewise - not Chinatown. I have a tendency to under value Asian food because of the \"Chinatown pricing\" argument but, given the service, atmosphere, and well executed plates, I've been forced to reconsider my usual cheap tendencies regarding this type of food.   What's more: I'll probably be back. That's right, for a third time.   Last bits that I forgot to mention:  - cereal milk ice cream with chocolate chips; you're welcome  - if you order the branzino and the katsu, taste the branzino first (it's delicious but, since it's light, you won't like it after taking a bite of the crack-infused katsu gravy)   - enjoyed the cocktail with calamansi juice (tasted fresh and not bottled)   - you can order most of the milk bar items for dessert served to your table (except cakes and shakes and other things)  - thumbs all the way up for reservations on opentable   - private dining room looks awesome   - large format dinner options are available and tempting    - lunch through 2:30pm (no raw items at lunch)  - limited offering 2:30pm - 5:00pm   - full service dinner at 5:00pm",

Somewhere along the price line, I'd rather opt for a really good steak.  That being said, I did not regret my trip to Momofuku. People had told me how the portions were small and they came away hungry. Before you order the server tells you anything you order will fit on the plate in front of you (which was the size of a bread plate).  I went with three others and we ended up getting the Duck. It was amazing and actually quite filling. There was a table side preparation which added to the experience.  This was a great change of pace from the usual steak house, and although expensive, it was very good.",

    "text": "The Goods 1. Pork ramen: the noodles are what make this dish, they are aldente/chewy and have a light flavor.  For ramen lovers! It also comes with bean sprouts and pork as part of the toppings.  A lot of times they offer a sweet and spicy momofuku ramen sauce, add for extra zing 2. Chicken karaage and pork steamed buns: for someone who doesn't love steamed buns sandwiches I did enjoy these.  I removed the red onions.  I love the crunch and flavor of the karaage!   3. Cocktails: johnnys margarita is tasty and the seven spice sour with shichimi is worth trying for something different  4. Ginger scallion noodles: you gotta love the taste of pickled mushrooms, onions, and wakame seaweed.  Again the ramen noodles make the dish!  Note this is a brothless \"ramen\" dish  Service 1. Water or bottled, they keep it coming  2. Wait time is long and you usually end up sitting at the bar. 3. Can take a while for food  Ambiance  1. Inside Cosmopolitan Vegas: very upscale like a New York ramen house. 2. Try to sit where there is a window so you can take in the scenery and the strip 3. Fairly pricey for ramen, but worth trying once since there is only this one and the NY location 4. Credit cards accepted  5. Associated with milkbar by Christina Tosi  MoJo 1. It's an experience.  I'd say a combination of trying a concept from NY is what puts it on the map 2. Ramen is what they are known for but they have some high priced items like wagyu beef",

Pork Ramen 4 out of 5 stars - comes w shredded pork shoulder, poached egg, slice of pork belly, vegetables, noodle and some tasty broth. Added shitake which I would strongly recommend. Shoulder was a tad dry and I think broth is what makes or breaks ramen. This one was good but I've had better. Also couldn't not adjust spice level - they only offer one level.   Da Belly Bun 2 out of 5 stars - the bun was warm and fluffy. That is where the fun stops :(  Belly wasn't particularly tasty and the sauce was nothing special.   Bottom line - go for the ramen and excellent service. Skip the belly bun.",

When we asked the waiter, he told us that they do not include the ramen on their dinner menu but you're still able to order it. Which is kind of weird imo because it's one of their popular dishes.   I ordered the pork belly buns and shoyu pork ramen. The pork belly buns were soooo good and juicy! It literally melted in my mouth and the sauce was bomb! The ramen was also very flavorful,  the pork was nice and tender, and the egg was nicely poached and not runny into my soup They have sauce for the ramen that tastes like a mixture of sriracha and hoisin sauce. The food is on the pricier side but it's what you should expect from restaurants located in hotels on the Strip.",

    "text": "Momofuku Las Vegas was outstanding during its first two years at the Cosmo.  I regularly visited for the duck, the pork chops, the baos and ramen late night.  As someone who has enjoyed David Chang's restaurants since opening in NYC in 2004, I was excited they opened this beautiful space, covered with David Choe art in Las Vegas.  We celebrated our anniversary here in May and couldn't have been more disappointed.  The same dishes I've been regularly enjoying have all gone down hill quite a bit.  Both the pork baos and pork chop were overcooked and the miso sea bass was underwhelming.  I could only guess this coincided with the departure of executive chef Shaun King (who left to open a restaurant in Portland).  Unfortunately David Chang is not there to supervise his restaurant so we're really dependent on quality chefs that can consistently cook and deliver the menu as it was intended.  I'm hopeful this kitchen gets it together and can bring back the experiences I've enjoyed in the first couple of years.  This downfall happens with too many celebrity owned restaurants that open in Las Vegas only to be corporate run by others without the same passion it began with.     **Additional note**  We were gifted a Momofuku gift card and after we turned it in to the waiter with my credit card for the remaining balance he returned moments later and said they do not accept Momofuku gift cards at this location and went ahead and charged the entire $300+ amount on my credit card!  I suppose it's partially our fault for not checking ahead of time but this was a major disappointment (probably has something to do with being located in a casino) and perhaps we would have tried a new restaurant had we known we were going to be paying the full amount out of pocket.  On the flip side, we were able to use the card at Majordomo in Los Angeles which was 5 stars outstanding!",

    "text": "*Lunch review  I really wanted to love this place and I dont want to sh** on this restaurant, but it was very overpriced.  It seemed as if the lunch menu was the same price as the dinner menu.    We started out sharing the Pork Belly Buns ($14) and the Pickle Plate ($12).  Both were delicious and they both went together,  yet it seemed like some pickled items to munch on should come with this dish complimentary.  I'm not saying the same as the small plate, but some.    For our entrees we shared the Grilled Striped Bass ($28) and the Bo Ssam Bowl ($17). I started with the Striped Bass and I feel it kinda fell off.  The salt pearls on the greens were good and the mushrooms also.  The kimchi butter I'm assuming was the sauce at the bottom of the dish, this was pretty good.  The fish was good, but not exceptional. This dish fell short of imagination I guess,  not what I expected from what I've seen David Chang cook on his docuseries (Ugly Delicious or Mind of a Chef). The Bo Ssam was tasty, but I thought and I guess I assumed it was gonna come out in a cast iron pot.  Once again, tasty but the cast iron pot, making the rice crispy and burnt, would have put it over the top.   Drinks were good  $14 slice of cake for the birthday cake was deffinately over priced and nothing special.   I wish I could have tried the Salt & Pepper Crab & Shrimp ($289 for 4-6 people).  I just cant pay that much for the wife and I especially for lunch.  They even offered to order a half plate but still $145 for a lunch entree does seem over priced.   It seems like it is assumed that people will pay the high price, therefore they should charge the high price.  I dont mind paying for food but in the context of what I'm eating really makes the difference.",

The restaurant is located amongst others inside the Cosmopolitan.  I went with a group of friends after EDC weekend and it wasn't too busy. But a reservation is definitely recommended.   The pork belly shoyu ramen was interesting and quite tasty. Although I am not a real big shoyu fan.. I gotta stick with my creamy tonkotsus   However, the Momofuku OYSTERS were out of this world good!! Probably the best rendition of grilled oysters I have ever had. It is life-changing!!",

    "text": "Awesome food and awesome service. I can't really pinpoint the style of Momofuku. It's not Asian fusion. Or at least not exactly the underwhelming and cliche Asian fusion restaurants I've come across. Momofuku has its own unique twists to dishes that make it distinct, yet reminiscent of Asian comfort food.   Momofuku is located at the Cosmopolitan close to The Chandelier. We had no trouble getting seating for two people on a Friday night. The two servers were so friendly and every water glass was filled and empty dishes were cleared with efficiency. Almost too well and overly attentive. Lighting is a little dark. Great for a romantic ambiance.  1. Pork Belly Buns (5/5): The first bite and I was in love. Typically this type of dish is made with Peking Duck and served during special occasions. I'm surprised the pork belly worked so well. My friend and I literally looked at each other with joy once we took in the first bite. The meat is so tender, not gamey, with just the right amount of pork belly fat. Worth the $7 each.  2.  Honey crisp Apple Salad (5/5): I do believe this dish is offered year-round, but the ingredients are seasonally changed with slight variations. I was expecting a wimpy salad with little bits of apple. Not the case at all. In an unexpected take, it's actually large pieces of apple coated in spices. Sitting on labne (like thick yogurt) with some sort of citrus oil. With crispy bacon and topped with arugula. Absolutely delicious.  3. Beef noodles (3/5): Probably the most disappointing dish. It's essentially a type of Szechuan-inspired noodle dish. Not worth the price at all. A small serving of thin yellow noodles, bits of ground beef, and a Szechuan chili-based sauce. Wasn't impressed at all.  Overall: This restaurant is an ideal date spot or celebration spot. I probably wouldn't put it on my regular rotation, but I can definitely see how Momofuku has impacted so many diners.",

    "text": "Yay! Finally got to try Momofuku! Met up with my girlfriend and her husband for dinner and this is what she wanted.   After making several calls on Saturday, I learned that dinner service starts at 5:30 pm.  Because it is so busy, no walk-ins are accepted, you have to RSVP, like early.  For this past Saturday, the only available time was 9 pm and 10 pm, which was too late in the evening as my husband works super early in the morning. I learned that our option to walk-in for dinner at 5pm is at the bar. It took a few phone calls and different people to understand this.   My husband and I get there and I see that the tables and bars aren't filled. So I grab a corner at the bar so the four of us can still have a conversation since all the tables were taken.  But then the hostess walks a couple over to that very spot.  I ask her since it wasn't busy, could we have this corner spot and they can take the two seats over.  She says no because there is a wait. Hmmm...we were just there, there wasn't anyone there!! Well, just like that, 40-minute wait. Where in the world did these people come from!!!???  I'm not digging the main hostess either, the other hostesses were alright. It may have been her bun that was tightly pulled back, eyeglasses and the emotionless, smileless facade that's bugging me.  So we sit and the service was good. Our server explained the family style dishes and encouraged it since there was four of us.  Short menu, but expeeeeeensiiiiive :o Not a problem, we'll split the bill.  We ordered jidori chicken, lamb ribs and scallion noodles.  Although ramen was not listed on the menu because it is not sharable, it is available to order.  Since the three items we ordered was already $100, we decided that if we were still hungry, we could order the ramen later.  The food was good.  The chicken was piled high. there were 8 ribs where the meat practically fell off the bone and the noodles were really good, which I wish we had more of.  The still water was really good too, filtered 7 times with the special machine they have in the back.   Earlier, when we were waiting for a seat to be available, my girlfriend bought a few items from Milk next door.  When we were done with dinner, the waitress asked if we wanted dessert.  Instead, my girlfriend wanted to share with us what she got from Milk since the dessert menu for Momofuku comes from Milk anyway.  So the server was happy to help us out with providing us plates, a knife and forks.  Turns out, my girlfriend's husband paid for dinner.  It was a thank you for the show tickets we got for them. That was very sweet of them, so I'm glad we were content and didn't order more food.  I don't want to bankrupt my dear friend.  So the rating - Great food service, lighting was a little too dark for me, but nice atmosphere, great food, not pleased with the robotic hostess nor the price.  So although we were here for the food, for that kind of price, I expect fabulous service from the hostess as they set the tone for the entire experience. It isn't the best rating but it isn't the worst either.  3-stars for Momofuku.  I'll be back.",

    "text": "I've heard good things about the Momofuku restaurants in NYC, but never had the chance to go. Happy to have been able to visit the Las Vegas location on a recent family trip. Overall, food was great modern twist on classic Asian flavors, but definitely on the pricier side.  1. Honeycrisp Apple Salad: Was not expecting it to be just apples with a few slices of bacon - but was pleasantly surprised by how good the dish was. The sweetness and crunchiness of the apples were paired well with the spiciness of the kimchi and saltiness of the bacon.  2. Pork Belly Bun: A must try according to all of the reviews and definitely delicious - but at $14 for 2 buns not sure if it's worth.  3. Whole Roasted Branzino: Our waiter recommended this to us as a good dish to share among our family of 4. Soft boneless branzino grilled with kimchi on top resting on a bed of crisp rice was definitely my favorite dish of the night. But again, not sure if it was worth $72.  Great place to try on the Vegas strip if you're willing to shell out the big bucks for a nice meal.",

It's a bit on the pricier side but I think that it's worth the experience. Some things are more worth trying than others. The pork belly is a must- I think it's one of their most popular dishes, understandably so. The spicy cucumbers are also delicious! They're refreshing and surprisingly delicious- I'm normally not a fan of cucumbers, but they have such an interesting taste. Amazing that something so simple was extremely delicious! The wagyu flat iron steak was amazing! The meat was so tender and the sauce over it was light and sweet. It makes my mouth water just thinking about it. Other dishes I could have done without. The grilled lamb and the wasabi potatoes I could have done without. The wasabi was overpowering and the sweet potato flavors and strong wasabi did not compliment each other. The potatoes were nice and crispy but the flavors did not match up to me- it was my least favorite dish. The lamb was also a bit salty to me as well. It was not as delicious as some of the other dishes. The Hawaiian kampachi is also worth mentioning. It was light and fresh. The fish was super tender and I loved the hint of orange! Overall most of the dishes were really good and I would definitely come back!   Also they gave my brother a cookie from the famous milk stand right next door for his birthday which I though was a very nice touch!",

Pork belly was so juicy with just the right crunch.  Next, we had the cod fish. It was delicious, but my only complaint is the price. $52 for a piece of cod is a little ridiculous, but it was date night and we needed our protein so we got it.   Lastly, we had the spicy garlic noodles. These were amazing and had some Thai spice, I think, which I don't mind. But be careful if you don't like spicy foods.",

I know that may not sound like much, but it was really refreshing in the middle of the strip to run into someone genuinely nice who took great care of us.  We got the grilled lamb ribs, pork belly buns, ginger scallion noodles, truffle & burrata salad, and crack pie a la mode. It was a good quantity of food for two guys.  Grilled Lamb Ribs - super tender and fell right off the bone. Pork Belly Buns - tender and delicious. Adding the ssam sauce took those buns to a whole other level. Ginger Scallion Noodles - were perfect. Truffle & Burrata Salad - was actually my least favorite part of the meal. It was spicier than I expected in a Chinese mustard kind of way, and the sauce was a little heavy handed. The sourdough croutons were really crispy so nothing on the dish helped cut through the sauciness of it all.  The crack pie a la mode was good enough to make my overall experience worth a fifth star. This dessert was so good! Everything from the decadent, rich pie, the salty cereal lying under the ice cream, and the milkiest (it really tastes like milk) ice cream I've ever had came together so well.",

I had a tender belly ramen soup that is on the lunch menu, but not the dinner. (You can still order it for dinner.) Seriously, fantastic with a fried or poached egg in it. I had never seen that before.   I also had the pickle tray. It was perfectly season and tart. Highly recommend the whole experience.",

    "text": "I was really excited to try Momofuku because I'm a big fan of Chef David Chang.  My dinner experience during this visit wasn't as good as I had expected though.    I came on a Friday night for an early dinner as a walk-in.  Luckily they had me seated at the kitchen counter so I had a good up-close look at the chefs in action.  Crudite Plate -- <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2vLhOo2&s=0f27c2ad91e7c5cd080b6a4575e16a25563f0ed6a7df0c1dccc1c389518edb6b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2vLhOo2</a> I ordered the Crudite Plate for my appetizer simply because after two full days in Vegas, I needed to get more vegetables in my system.  This was definitely a plate you want to share because it had a good amount of raw veggies, more than I anticipated.  And the two sauces that came with the veggies added a lot of flavor.  Shrimp Bun -- <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2vL3bkB&s=641d924c09007729bafdeb81a726cb3f03be062a5681bc9ee74c999c309fbccd\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2vL3bkB</a> I liked the shrimp bun!  It was a good sized bun actually with a big crispy fried shrimp cake inside.  This was probably my favorite dish of the night and I wish I had ordered more than one.  Chicken Katsu -- <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2vLrjn2&s=692525049056c6e95f3b4c128f1f82da06486ce2d298a00791f001a55cee7412\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2vLrjn2</a> The biggest disappointment for me was the chicken katsu.  This was partially my fault for ordering it without reading its description on the menu assuming it was something different.  I thought it was going to be smothered in gravy and mushrooms as I've seen in some earlier yelp pictures, but it didn't occur to me that they changed the recipe for the season which was more like a traditional chicken katsu entree that you can get an any standard Japanese restaurant.  I tried a little bit of it and it was okay, but because I was expecting something different, it killed my appetite for it.  Thankfully, they took back the katsu and let me order something else.  King Crab Cold Ramen -- <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2vKU2Zy&s=8c1aa5b477711361a26c8f534f3aa00207f3863e1b70caf24cc9c89707e253b6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2vKU2Zy</a> I decided to try the king crab cold ramen since I heard it was good from other reviews.  Plus, I'm a fan of cold ramen as well.  Well, it thought it was okay.  It had a decent amount of crab and the broth was tasty.  The only thing that bothered me about it was the $58 price tag for it which I'm not sure it was worth that much.  More like $30, but not $58.  I think for me, I probably would've enjoyed Momofuku more if I had just stuck with the street food options such as their buns and ramen.  The Shrimp Bun was really good and the other Bun options looked good as well.  I'm willing to go back and try them again though because it's very likely the menu will be changed again, and hopefully they'll bring back that Chicken Katsu with the mushrooms and gravy.",

The pork belly ramen was a bit disappointing though because the broth was bland (the broth is so important!) and I've had so much good ramen in the bay area recently. I usually don't need my food to be very salty but this was really light. Pork belly and shoulder in the ramen were both good. They gave us complimentary cake balls from Milk Bar next door for my birthday, which was a nice surprise. All in all good experience!",

    "text": "WOW! momofuku was amazing! Good shxt David Chang!  The shiitake mushrooms in my noodle dish is to rave for! the eggs were cooked perfectly! the noodles were good, but I can see it being better(?). Everything about my noodle dish was perfectly balanced in the flavor spectrum.   I added the pork belly, and it was very tender. I could eat the entire bin of pork belly from momofuku with some lettuce wraps and ssam jang.   The brussel sprouts were very flavorful too! the flavor that I kept feeling was \"wow this is refreshing\". For example, if you drank sprite before (in your life) you understand that it gives your mouth a refreshing flavor. If you add some lemon or lime into your sprite, that refreshing quality enhances! momofuku is that enhancement to my taste buds!   Skip the shitty buffets that overcharges in every way they can for their mediocrity, and head on over to momofuku to get a glimpse of flavor. Hell, go gamble first, and if you lose money, at least youll feel like a winner after eating at momofuku.   Cheers!",

    "text": "I really wanted to love Momofuku. I support David Chang and I love his innovation around food, I love that David Choe's artwork is up on the wall.   But, at the end of the day, the food needs to stand on its own.  And, I felt like it didn't deliver on the hype.  It was decent food, with great ambience and okay service.   I've been to the location in NYC specifically for the ramen, felt it wasn't great, but wanted to try this location in hopes of experiencing the deliciousness that everyone raves about.  I ordered the pork belly ramen, the pork bao, and the pork chop with the truffle potatoes (pigs taste so good, amirite??).  Service, although incredibly friendly, was very slow.  It took about 40 minutes for the main entrees.  Water was filled regularly and appetizers did come out fairly quickly.  Lemme start with the pork bao, which was perfection.  Five stars.  Pork belly was tender and fatty, the sauce was just sweet enough, and the bun was soft, and all ingredients married well. It was a standard pork bao, but many don't do this classic well.  Momofuku nailed it.  They use the same pork belly in the ramen, which again was delicious.  There was a soft boiled egg as well, which was perfectly cooked.  But, ramen comes down to the broth and noodles for me and it basically tasted like instant ramen packet broth.  The noodles were standard, cooked al dente and pleasantly chewy.  Nothing to write home about.  It's like someone had just poured in some soy sauce in boilig water and said, Voila!  Pour and serve!  I wanted to be blown away and it was meh.  The pork chop was served with a side of peaches.  The peaches were the highlight. Nice and sweet, tender but not mushy. The pork was tender, but super fatty.  The side of truffle potatoes were basically tater tots with specialty cheese on top.  That cheese was bomb, paired with the crunch of the potato - it had great texture.  And, honestly who doesn't like tater tots?  Additional tips: -reservations available thru Open table -Milk Bar is next door; save room for dessert",

Things are spenny! Tried that she Shishito peppers the Bucatini with an undercooked egg, and the Jidori chicken.  The latter of which was incredibly dry and lackluster.

Highlights on the menu are Steamed Buns, Noodles, Meat and Raw Seafood. Plates are meant for sharing. The location of this Momofuku is in the Cosmopolitan Casino Hotel on the Las Vegas Strip. At this time (March 2018) this is the only Momofuku on the west coast.  For our first plate we shared the Pear and Burrata. Other ingredients were Hazelnuts, Butter Lettuce and Black Truffles. It was a joy to eat....Very Delicious!  For our main course we shared the Rotisserie Chicken Ssams. It was a good sized half chicken that was marinated and covered with delicious spices. I don't know what they all were but I could pick out star anise. The chicken was moist and had a crisp delicious skin. You eat it like an Asian Style Fajita. You take a piece of lettuce, add chicken, hoisin, and kimchi It's really awesome super delicious!!!!! The plate also contains ginger rice.  The food was FIVE stars to me....everything was so delicious.... I might have picked what they do best.  Our server was good. The place has a nice atmosphere and they play classic rock.  The one thing that was awful was the food runner. After we finished our first course we had an empty used plate on the table. The food runner comes out with our main course plate and instead of removing the used plate he makes a big deal and SLAMS the plate on top of the used plate. It was really LOUD too!  I know why he is a food runner. Can you imagine what kind of waiter he'd be? I'm still thinking about what an awful food runner he was.....   4.5 stars",

This place was crazy busy Thanksgiving weekend so there was a long line of people asking if they could eat without reservations and some people checking in for their reservations.  The menu was quite different than NYC, service was great in the beginning and then our server disappeared for 30 minutes. At least the food was very delicious, we tried quite a few items with the shrimp bun being the least favorite and everything else was excellent. The dessert was from next door which I guess the only dessert they have was the crack pie which we tried in NYC and found it not very good. Strange they would serve something not very popular in NYC to the Vegas location.  Anyway next time we come I hope to have 4 people in our party so we can try the large specialty items which they have a full page of items.  Will for sure be back.",

We actually had a reservation but while sitting in traffic, I called the restaurant about 15 mins before our reservation time to let them know we might be few minutes late.  They told us that they will not hold a table for us even with a courtesy call. WOW what a way to set the tone for customer service huh?   anyways, we arrived to the restaurant and were seated at the bar since they gave our table away while the restaurant was literally EMPTY...   We sat down and ordered.  We got their most popular item which is pork ramen which was small, bland, and pricey!   Overall, it was really over hype... the food is whatever and the service is mediocre.",

My wife and I took her family for their first DC experience and it did not disappoint us, nor them.  Pork Belly Buns. Honeycrisp Apple Salad. Whole Jidori Chicken. Cold Chili Garlic Noodles. Ginger Scallion Noodles. Grilled Lamb Ribs. Rice Cakes. Denver Steak.  ::drool::  We've had the pork belly buns (with their original ssam sauce), but we had to have them again. The apple salad nicely balanced our meal with some sweet tones and crisp textures. That chicken though... my goodness! So much flavor, juicy throughout, and the skin was amazing. Both cold noodle dishes were yummy, though the entire table preferred the spicy garlic noodles. The full rack of lamb ribs were fall-off-the-bone tender. Perfection! The rice cakes were a favorite of my wife's family. I'm not a huge fan but I can appreciate the texture provided by this dish. Lastly, the Denver steak. Medium rare. Tender. Not as much fat marbling as I prefer, but for the price, an excellent dish.  What I appreciated most about the meal was the attention to detail. The order of each dish took us on a journey, transitioning nicely from one to the next. Lots of texture, lots of flavor, a bit of spicy, a bit of sweetness, savory and umami, balanced saltiness, no bitters (but that's ok).  Overall: Excellent! Need to visit again soon!!",

The pork ramen was delicious, my absolute favorite with perfectly poached egg and fatty pork belly. On top of that I had 2 pork belly buns to myself. The pork belly is the elevated version that (if you're Asian) you've had as a kid.. tender braised pork belly.

I moved to Texas a few years ago for work and one thing I miss from the west coast is this cool eclectic vibe where all the crazy comes together to build something organic and cool. Imagine that being made into food form.   Always ask your servers what they would want to eat and you will almost always get the best dishes on the menu. Ryan and Ashley were my servers tonight and I was not lead astray. The best dish tonight was the tuna crudo with apple and shaved foie Gras. What?! Exactly. I was silent for 5 mins because it was so good - and I'm pretty chatty. Second best dish is the apples with Kim chi dressing on lemon labne cream. Yeah... I said that strange combination of words. Again crazy, unexpected, but cool. The lamb ribs and pork chop were excellent too, but they didn't steal the show like my two first courses did.   I had a full on food-gasm. I haven't had one in months.   Oh, and add 90s hip hop and a cool entertaining staff? The music was better than some of the clubs I've been to. The vibe. Man. Who doesn't love bobbin their head when eating badass food like this?  There is truly nothing like this place. It's me in a nutshell, crazy Asian fusion that is unexpectedly awesome.",

The service was also outstanding and our waitress was quite knowledgeable about a complex menu.   The pork ramen is incredible! It is quite different from a typical ramen and has an almost smokey flavor with strong umami sensations with mushroom and kombu hints. It is loaded with toppings and includes a large amount of delicious pork belly. We shared this dish three ways so we could all try the ramen and still try some of the other dishes.   The pork belly buns are completely out of this world with flavor. The bun is soft yet fluffy. The the pork belly is meaty, soft, and with an out standing seer on the fat.   The kobe beef is quite the show! Look at the pictures and video of the table side blow torch on a salt rock.",

Started off with the pork belly buns which were $7 each and they were absolutely salty. Presentation and the amount of meat was superb, but I couldn't chow down how salty it was. Our server, Cesar, was did not need to take it off our bill as we had finished it but he did which was nice. Next up was the house special which wasn't on the menu, Black Truffle Ramen $46ish? Again, not sure if the chef's taste buds that day were off but it was SUPER salty. I did not want to bring that up to our server too as I did not want to look as if I'm looking for freebies. To end it on a good note, the Wagyu steak ($34?) was AMAZING!!!! If you are planning on stopping here, definitely get the steak!   Tldr; Pass on Pork belly bun and Black truffle ramen. Get Wagyu steak!",

It had an immediate view of the kitchen prep counter where the staff was working on dishes.   Ordered the spicy cucumbers as an appetizer and the ramen for the lunch entree. Ramen came with the most delicious soft boiled egg. The spicy cucumbers were big chunks of cucumbers with various spices sprinkled on it and peanuts on top. The cucumbers were oddly sized - too big to eat individually in one bite. The flavor mix was wonderful though. The ramen noodles were chewy and delicious with a rich broth. The pork slices were sliced unusually thick which made it a big messier  to eat.   Would definitely come back to try other items on the menu when I have more time and I'm not rushing out the door.   Service was quick and pleasant. Next time I won't sit at the kitchen prep counter as it was a little distracting.",

    "text": "Hip and simple spot that's great for lunch. The group decided to eat here because the wait time at the Wicked Spoon was too long (cry cry) and everyone was too starving to wait. Ended up being a pretty good alternative, considering we had dinner reservations not too long afterwards. Here's the food summary:  - Bigeye Tuna: the shaved foie gras gave this dish a buttery smooth texture. Tuna was fresh and the flavor was good. Just not $38 good.   - Pork Belly Buns: yesssss that fatty meat was delicious, not overly cooked like some places can do with pork belly. Add some of their house sauce to it and this will definitely hold you over for a while. Order a few.   - Shrimp Buns: I'm told this was good. Didn't try it myself   - Crispy Potatoes: this was fantastic. The potatoes were amazing with the truffle and Parmesan. Only thing is that this is definitely a shareable side dish, but every person at the table ordered their own. No complaints tho, this made for great hangover food the next morning.   Random note: I've always told myself that Japanese restaurants should embrace the culture completely and have a proper Japanese toilet in their bathrooms. Although Momofuku isn't a traditional Japanese restaurant really, they have become the first restaurant outside of Japan where I've seen the full blown fancy toilet, complete with the seat warmer and remote control to adjust the bidet. Just don't think about the germs that are probably all over that remote and wash your hands after like the clean person you should be.",

We started off with the sake our server recommended and oysters while we were still deciding on what to order. Couple of people in our party ordered truffle ramen, which was great.  Couple of us wanted to try out a5 wagyu but we couldn't find a picture on yelp to help us decide. So we asked our server about details. It was on the expensive side with $48/oz and min 4 oz per order. Instead, our server recommended that we go family style, and set a budget of say 120$ per person, decide a quantity of wagyu and rest will be mixed proteins and vegetable dishes. This was one of the BEST decisions. 5 of us participated in this family style sharing and it was mind blowing. The server even teased that everone else will want to have a slice of things you will be getting. We got cucumber with peanuts, shishito peppers, ramen, jidori chicken, lamb, their delicious pork buns, and the star of the evening wagyu. Everything was mindblowing. Highly recommend going for this family style which gets you almost everything in the menu to try out. And, icing on the cake was that server overheard about our birthday conversation for an upcoming birthday, and he brought a birthday cookie.",

Ginger scallion noodles -same bomb noodles as the ramen -light refreshing flavors of ginger and green onion with a little acidity added went so well with the cucumbers and the shiitake mushrooms, this is what I'm going to order when I come back because it's clean eating after a night of partying  Shrimp bun -flavorful patty but not sure if I would order again  Pork belly bun -think Peking duck but with a thick slab of tender pork belly,  this one is a keeper  Bo ssam rice bowl -meh,  not much flavor on the burnt pork,  Kimchi was definitely lacking flavor , wouldn't order again  The service was top notch with water refills after every few sips, lots of attentive and quick service and very friendly  Definitely going to be one of my favorites in vegas for sure!",

The staff was great and the decor was trendy.  We ordered the Heart of Palm salad, 3 orders of the Pork Bao, 2 orders of the Ribeye, and 1 whole roasted Branzino. Best things were the Appetizers. The Branzino was good, very tender and flaky, sort of like Mahi but it was also caked on with Kimchee.. So midway into the fish you could only taste the kimchee. Ribeye was extremely fatty so that wasn't worth finishing. Drinks were great. Definitely recommend the Pork Baos. 4 of us came out to $520 w/out gratuity. Glad we got to try it bc the restaurant is in such high regards but maybe just visit next time for lunch.",

The Las Vegas location is fairly new and we went for lunch without reservations. We were seated immediately at the chef's bar. The service was great, the restaurant is larger than what you can see up front,  the chicken karaange bun was SO good (5/5). Reminiscent of a delicious and well-balanced chicken sandwich. I wasn't to hungry so I ordered the \"wedgeless wedge salad\". It consisted of romaine lettuce, thinly sliced radishes & apple, bacon ranch dressing, and 3 shrimp that were sliced in half.  For the price I expected more (especially more than a few cold shrimp sliced in half. Bleh. I couldn't even eat them). The redeeming factors were the bacon ranch and surprisingly the apples which provided the perfect brightness to the dish. (3/5) I wish I would have gone with the sure bet - pork ramen. And maybe a few more buns   Still love Momofuku but will never order that salad again.",

We appreciate chefs pushing boundaries with new bold flavors and eclectic takes on what are considered traditional dishes. Whilst David has tried to expand the flavors with black truffle, foie grass and Sichuan peppers that tingle your taste buds, the food leaves you feeling gimmicked, especially at that price.   The foie gras shaving on the tuna barely adds the fattiness or the gaminess of foie gras. This dish would have tasted better with the tuna served on a slice of foie gras.   The crispy rice cakes with Sichuan peppers could have used less salt.   The saving grace on the $50 truffle ramen was the broth and black truffle. The noodles were too chewy similar to udon and not alkaline enough for ramen.   Overall we were very disappointed. Modernist cuisine fails when the traditional version of the dish tastes better than the altered one.",

    "text": "When in Vegas, you got to splurge a bit and I did here at Momofuku. I heard good things about this place and people have recommended me to try it. It's located in the Cosmopolitan. I did a reservation at 1:00 PM and we had no issues getting seated on time. All the workers here are very friendly. Our server was very attentive and great.   Between the 5 of us, we ordered 2 pork ramens ($17 each), 2 pork buns ($7 each), a wagyu ssam ($32), a chicken ssam ($29), and a cucumber salad ($9). A lot of food, but we wanted to try as much as we could since we're not in Vegas very often. The cucumber salad was really delicious. It was light with a bit of a citrus flavor and almonds in top. The pork ramen was really good too. The pork and broth both had a nice light, smokey flavor. The pork was well cooked and melted in your mouth. This goes the same with the pork belly buns. You can see that the pork belly was well marbled between the fat and meat so everything melted in your mouth. The wagyu ssam was good, but I advise you to cut it into 2-3 pieces when wrapping it in the butter lettuce and rice. It was hard to bite a piece of the meat when I wrapped it, kind of my fault for that haha. Chicken ssam was okay. It was cooked well, not too dry, but the seasoning was too salty for me.  Overall, food was good. I recommend the cucumber salad and pork ramen. If I were to ever eat here again, I would get those 2 items. Also, they charge you $1 per person for \"crysalli\" water. We were not aware that they charge $1 for water until we got the bill. But, we still had a good experience here.",

If I'm gonna have tuna and foie gras I'd rather have them separate and the foie gras of the not shaved variety, I don't think it added that much to the taste.  Sichuan lamb ribs: These were excellent and probably one of the best values on the menu.  If you're a lamb lover, this and part of a side would probably make for a full meal.  Salt and pepper lobster and shrimp for two: Also good and also not a bad value, it's not cheap but you get a pretty fair amount of shrimp and lobster.  The lobster was in particular perfectly cooked, tender and juicy.  I'd say in most cases this plus a side plus an app would be enough food for 3 people.  Toasted noodles: Good but not amazing.  You do get a fair amount of large tasty shrimp.  May be a little on the spicy side for some people.  Asparagus: Great, and the egg was perfectly poached and delicious.  This is not an egg they got off the shelf at the grocery store.  The miso butter is quite strong but if you don't like it you can probably avoid it.  Crispy potatoes: Probably coulda been crispier and I wasn't that big a fan of the truffle flavor.",

First attempt trying to come here on a weekend with a party of 9 didn't work out but due to the hype, we made sure to make a reservation the next day to ensure seats when we wanted to eat. Service was quick despite it being busy and we were quickly seated and given water.  My friends ordered the pork belly buns as appetizers and raved about them the rest of the meal. My whole party ordered pork ramen and I got the ginger scallion noodles with added chicken. Immediately we noticed our ramen was lukewarm, leaning towards too cool for hot noodle soup. As the only vegetarian broth, I felt my ramen was a bowl of noodles in cool water, really dissatisfying since I was super hungry. As a group of Bay Area natives, we could name a handful of ramen shops that would have richer broths so would definitely skip this over-hyped shop.",

    "text": "Pro's: Good portion sizes, service is on point Con's: N/A  I happened to be in town when they opened and was able to get a reservation on the second night. Never really travelling to the east coast, I was so happy to see Momofuku treading west. We decided to try as much as we could considering they just opened and we won't be back for some time. There was an issue where only one of our buns came out instead of two, but I'm not the type of person to go crazy. Things happen, if I see them trying to fix it, I'm good. Not a fan of long reviews, but just breaking down my thoughts:  Soft Boiled Eggs: Highly recommend - really savory, soft, and the crispy rice cake topped on it adds a nice crunchy texture. When you get that roe with your bite, that smokiness comes out, its good.  Pork Belly bun - Highly recommend - The pork was so savory, rich, and fatty. When you take a bite, it just melts. A bit messy, but you know the slogan.. if it doesn't get all over the place, it doesn't belong in your face.  Chicken Karaage bun - When you bite down, you get that crunch from the crispiness. The flavor is good, but the whole bun thing didn't work for me. I would much prefer to eat the karaage by itself.  Oysters Momofuku - All of the flavors combined really reminded me of uni udon. It has a creamy texture with some crunch, it flows together nicely. A little bit on the salty side, but not a bad dish. Note, it feels like a hot dish - so don't expect that half shell drizzling lemon stuff.  Black Winter Truffle Ramen - Noodles cooked well, rich thick broth, good flavor. Aside from the truffle itself, it felt a little plain. Maybe I've gotten used to eating ramen with a bunch of stuff in it, but the overall flavor is good.  Spicy Sichuan Rice Cakes - Highly recommend - There aren't many places that make rice cake crispy, and I was not disappointed. That spice is packed, not too salty, flavor is on point. Bite size pieces make it easy to just plop into your mouth. I wanted to eat more, but this was the last dish out.. so I probably would've exploded.  Overall: Would come back again to try other things on the menu. Portion sizes are good so you don't feel like you're over eating unless you ordered a lot like we did. Food comes out pretty quickly and the service is attentive. Also, you're not really breaking the wallet coming here, which is always a plus.",

    "text": "My family and I were in town for a family vacation and I've had this place bookmarked for a while now so we decided to try it. My sister called around 730 pm asking how long the wait was and they told her that the wait was going to be around 45 minutes and that it would be better to make a reservation, so luckily they had something for 9 pm which we took.   When we got there we were greeted by the most unpleasant host. Keep in mind we're excited to try this place and this one host in particular with long brown hair (there were 3 of them), is the reason for this review. Not once did she even smile at us or even acknowledge that were there. When I came to check in and let them know that we were here she just acted like she was \"too good\" and kind of \"shooed\" us away. She almost had this bitchy attitude like it was a sin to ask her any questions. Being a host before, I know from experience that the host of a restaurant is the first point of contact for the customers and that the hosts are their very first impression. So before even going in and looking at the menu I already had a dreadful experience and honestly it was killing my vibe and I lost my appetite.   When we finally got seated, we had a delightful server- a very petite lady with blonde hair. Luckily she was our server who was able to turn my night around. She was so sweet and delightful. The food was also very good...these are the reason why I'm giving this restaurant 3 stars. Not sure if I'd come back to this location.",

    "text": "Like every other trash heap masquerading as a classy establishment on the strip, this place is way overpriced for the tiny amount of uncooked dead animal flesh they serve you. I feel bad for being a little ungrateful, but with a bill somwhere around $90, I wasted most of my per diem on less than 300 calories of something sort of chewable and a drink that cost nearly half as much as all the bottles it came from and would have been more fun to learn how to make myself. Unless your life chasing after infantile images of wealth in the form of power, money, fame, and soulless sex has left you so empty inside that the only way you can avoid having to go back to your hotel room and look at yourself in the mirror is to waste all of your money trying to impress your friends with your nuanced palette for syrup delivered on death, get off the strip, eat some real food, encounter real people, have real conversations, and remember what an actual good time looks like before agreeing to go out with your idiot friends to \"let loose\" again. Exert a little will and suggest you all go camping instead. They'll thank you later and applaud your creative vision. Just remember to leave your portable poolside speakers at home and pick up your trash. Or you know, if you like to think you're the kind of person who appreciates Japanese cuisine, save up and take a more memorable trip to Japan and eat some delicious ramen for less than you tipped your waiter. Life's too short to waste pretending to have something you don't actually want in the first place.",

It was still shiny and well, frankly, RAW inside. It had that smooth, shiny appearance when we cut into it. We could not eat it. SUPER disappointing.

I've tried his restaurant in New York City before an I thought it was descent, so when I found out that he had a restaurant in Las Vegas I had to try it too. My bf ordered the pork ramen, and I got the spicy noodles. Neither of the dishes were good. I've had better instant ramen than what we got here. My spicy noodles was worse, the noodles were flavorless. It actually tastes like they just boiled the noodles, topped it with red chili peppers, very peppery meat, some chopped Thai basil, and roasted cashews. Worse noodles I've ever eaten. I would never come back again. Very sad with the food we got I couldn't even finish the noodles. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone.",

He was knowledgeable about every element on the menu, made excellent recommendations, and was courteous and attentive.  The food, as before, was excellent.  The truffle ramen is perhaps my favorite thing in the world to eat, and it didn't disappoint a second time.  We began the meal with a pork belly and shrimp bun.  We both preferred the shrimp bun to the pork belly.  We were encouraged to try the charred cauliflower and brussels sprouts marinated in fish sauce which was very hearty and difficult to stop eating.  We ordered way too much food, and couldn't finish our rotisserie chicken which has the crispiest skin of any chicken I've ever had.",

    "text": "Los Angeles seems to be the only coast not yet conquered by David Chang, so was excited to find myself at the Cosmopolitan while conferencing for the week.  Being a few month old,  celebrity chef-fronted restaurant on the Strip, the place was packed, and running behind on service. (I would reserve 30-45 minutes earlier than you intend to eat, check-in and grab a drink). The wait, it seems, was well worth it.  Dining with a group about 5-6 works well here as the dishes are best enjoyed family-style, and you want to maximize your tastes from the delicious menu.   Items ordered: - Pork Belly Bun/Shrimp Bun - Fried Brussel Sprouts - Yellowtail Sashimi - Mashed Potatoes - Steamed Broccoli - Soft Boiled Egg - Ginger Scallion Noodles - Prime New York Strip - Smothered Katsu Chicken - Smoked Pork Chop - Oysters on the Half Shell - Steamed RIce  The signature pork belly bun and ginger scallion noodles were tasty compliments to the heartier mains.  The sauce on the Smothered Chicken Katsu is Asian chicken fried umami greatness, but the two most surprising were the Mashed Potatoes (devilishly smooth and creamy) and the Soft Boiled Egg. This egg, chilled creamy yolk topped with smoked salmon roe and crispy rice - a delectable multi-textured couple of bites.  Stop, do not pass go, without inhaling some of these. These are the eggs deviled eggs dream of.   Exceeded my expectations and dishes did not have forced flavor as some other celebrity driven spots around the city.  Front of house hopefully gets themselves organized soon, but otherwise service was excellent. Happy pork belly dreams.",

    "text": "I'm a local who also lived in NYC so I have been to the NY location many times and loved it. I've been here in Vegas a few times and though the first time was spectacular each time after I've left disappointed. The menu has been completely changed, missing things, or restricting certain items to certain times. It's incredibly frustrating for the prices. There's very little consistency. Even the items that are on the menu every time I've tried- they have changed dramatically. For example the ahi tuna with shaved foie gras. The first time I tried it right around opening we were treated to amazing big sashimi slices of ahi and THICK shaved pieces of foie gras completely covering the plate. The last time I tried it, the ahi was in tiny cubes a la poke mixed with tomatoes and peppers and the foie gras was grated and only served on a quarter of the plate. Still good but not nearly as decadent and the same price. No consistency. The chicken buns have gone missing on the menu even though they still have fried chicken and all the components to make them. But they apparently make a chicken sand which that they'll only sell at 11pm and after? The winter truffle ramen has gone missing (though I suspect it's a seasonal specialty and I hope that is the case and it returns) The chicken noodle ramen is gone as well.  Ramen (this chefs signature in NYC and the reason people go) now is off the menu and is only available at the bar, late night or by request at dinner which I find incredibly odd- if you serve it, and have no problem serving it why not put it on the menu and instead of making it seem like a nuisance if it's ordered or like you're hiding it from diners.  But other items such as the branzino, pork burns etc. Have never left the menu and are consistently the same.   The lack of consistency is frustrating, the change of items and ingredients as well. Especially since there are few substitutions for what they take away (I.e no more chicken noodle ramen so no meat based options for ramen other than pork.)  I love momofuku, and would gladly wait in line In NYC, I keep going in Vegas hoping to be as impressed as I was when it first opened- but it just keeps frustrating me and disappointing me. As a local I'm not the general out of town customer who comes once and doesn't know better- but I am a customer who would come consistently and become a 'regular' if I knew what I was getting. It's hard to make fans if you keep offering inconsistency. I always know what I'm getting at MILK or Momofuku in NYC. they don't change ingredients of meals that I've ordered before or take away simple classics. Mix that in with the hassle of locals having to pay for parking- it makes the restaurant much less appealing of a choice.",

We ordered:  Cocktails: -Herb-a-Peel - cachaca, plantain, artichoke, cassia -Miso Mellow - gin, miso, honeydew, arugula, lemon  Food: Small Plate - Shishito Peppers - smoked salt, lime Pork Belly Bun - hoisin, scallion, cucumber Large Plate - Grilled Lamb Ribs - cucumber, chili yogurt  The cocktails were delicious - haven't really had cachaca outside of caipirinhas, and I was pleasantly surprised how well it blended with this creamy drink!  My husband loves gin and thoroughly enjoyed his drink, too.  The food was amazing - the peppers were simple but addictive!  The pork bun was delicious - succulent pork belly balanced by a pillowy-soft bun, sweet hoisin and tangy cucumber.  The melodic balance of flavors was mirrored in the lamb dish - juicy, well-seasoned grilled lamb topped with cool chili yogurt and more tangy cucumbers.  Our favorite meal in Vegas!  Perfect from beginning to end.",

I would say we were more impressed by the starters, than what I thought would be the star of the show, the Shoyu Pork Ramen. We had the Pork Belly Buns, Oysters on the half shell and Sweet and Sour Long Beans to start. The oysters although fresh, were bland. The Pork Belly Buns were the star of the whole meal, a must have. We also did enjoy the long beans. We shared the Shoyu and both were unimpressed with the flavor, super bummed because we both had very high hopes. The pork was delicious and the egg was of course cooked to perfection but we could not get past the blandness of the broth. I would give the staff 5 stars they were very attentive and professional. For us, if we came back we would shy away from the ramen.",

My friend and I both ordered the pork ramen, and she also ordered the crispy potatoes. I would also say for the two seater tables, you're kind of a bit too close to the table next to you. Service was pretty good, and the atmosphere of the restaurant is nice.  The crispy potatoes had a truffle tofu sauce that was interesting and pretty good.  However the pork ramen, albeit it was a huge bowl, was like drinking SEA WATER. It was so disgustingly salty, and I get that pork ramen is not bland, but whoaaaaa....the shredded up pork salty. The pork belly salty. The broth though...wow. I was incredibly disappointed and tried to force myself to eat as much since it was a $17 bowl of ramen, but it was pure torture.  If I do go again next time, I will try the buns as that seems to be safer, but for $7 a tiny bun, it's a bit too much.",

    "text": "Actual rating 3.5.  The Momofuku (lit. lucky peach) Restaurant Group is an umbrella of restaurants founded by chef-owner David Chang. Fed up with working in fine dining, he wanted to serve his take on casual Asian cuisine to the masses. His four most successful concepts include his take on ramen (Noodle Bar), ssam (Ssam Bar), fried chicken sandwiches (Fuku) and desserts (Milk Bar, headed by former employee Christina Tosi and now its own business). While most of his restaurants are in the East Coast with a majority of them in NYC, this was his first Momofuku to be situated in the West Coast.   CONCEPT: Unlike the specialized concepts in the East Coast this particular Momofuku doesn't have one central theme. The dinner service is arguably the most generic out of the entire Momofuku lineup with focus on family-style group dining. The Vegas decadence ever present in Strip restaurants is in the form of using high-quality meats and using caviar for their fried chicken and caviar service. To partake in signature Momofuku signature concepts one must go during lunch or late nite at Peach Bar (begins 11pm). Both have a few ramen flavors during that time, with the famous ssam wraps only available during lunch.  VENUE: Located in the 2nd level of Boulevard Tower, you are first led to believe that the restaurant space consists of exactly what you see at the entrance. Turns out that this is all a facade - the space closest to the entrance is merely Peach Bar. The main dining room is at least twice as big as Peach Bar and is more akin to a more formal dining experience. Murals are painted by David Choe and feature his and Chang's dogs.  SERVICE: Good service overall.  We wanted to focus on the signature dishes so initially I was torn on the ssam and ramen. With accolades on Momofuku's ramen the family ended up getting bowls of their shoyu pork ramen (pork belly & shoulder, slow poached egg, $17). I added shiitake mushrooms for additional $2. It's a beautiful bowl at presentation especially with the poached egg at the center and the pork on the sides of the bowl but the ramen was a bit underwhelming, especially for $17. My siblings made a note that the broth was shoyu (soy sauce) while the best broth for ramen was tonkotsu, which has quite a bit more umami packed into the broth. This is when I realized that a *good* ramen bowl stems from the sum of its ingredients. A bowl may have good meat, al-dente noodles, fresh veggies and/or an umami-filled broth but if one of the components is subpar or underdeveloped (in this case bland broth), the ramen just falls apart. I'm willing to pay $17 for ramen but at that price the bowl must stand out, and for the bowl to stand out every component of that bowl must be top-notch.  The $7 buns are excellent in their execution. My sister and brother tried all 3 and thought all were delicious. I got to share half a pork bun with my mom. Best pork bun I had due to a very good slice of pork belly.   I'm not going to give up on this restaurant because of my subpar ramen experience. I would definitely love to try their ssams, especially their signature bo ssam. As for the ramen, I might not order the same ramen from this visit but I'm open to trying a bowl with a more umami-rich broth. As for the rest of my family they'll just settle on the desserts made by adjacent Milk Bar as they seem to like its creations better.",

    "text": "This place is located in the Cosmopolitan and is located next to Milk Bar as well.   The menu was a bit on the pricey end (there was caviar that was over $1k oh my) so I went with the shoyu ramen, the pork belly bao and the potatoes which I shared with someone.   Ramen: 3.5/5 I am personally a miso ramen person myself and so I wish I had just ordered the vegetarian miso ramen and added the pork belly and egg add ons. Otherwise, the contents of the ramen itself were pretty good with the classic soft boiled egg, naruto, seaweed etc.   Pork belly bao: 5/5 I LOVED this bao. I've ordered a lot of these before but this was perfect. Though it was a bit small, they nailed it perfectly. The pork belly was super crispy on the skin part but once you bit into it, it melted in the mouth like butter. Easily the best thing I ordered of the 3.   Potatoes: 4/5  It was a good dish to share with a friend. Realized we loaded up on a lot of carbs with my noodles and the bao lol. But they were pretty much loaded fingerling potatoes with some sauce you could dip it in!   I also tried some of my friend's slow roasted pork shoulder ssam (which is like doing a lettuce wrap with rice, kimchi and the meat together) and boi was it humongous. Yummy but started to get dense and she took it home for leftovers :)",

The pork belly bun showcased perfectly cooked (crispy yet melt-in-your-mouth) pork belly and is served with a flavorful house Ssam sauce on a pillowy bun. Great start to any meal. After a few sakes, we moved onto the cold chili garlic noodles, which packed a bold punch of spicy and savory flavors. The finer scallion noodles were a nice earthy, subtle counter to the cold noodle heat.  In addition to excellent food, what makes Momofuku a great experience is the service. Every interaction is personal and attentive. This attention to detail permeates the entire restaurant, which is a great one.",

    "text": "Ramen is a very competitive business in Las Vegas, even for Momofuku... the foot traffic is no where near the ones you'll find in NYC. Located on Level 2, Boulevard Tower of The Cosmopolitan, Momofuku serves different menu at different hours, whether it's lunch, social hour, dinner or late night... there is something to satisfy the appetite. If you have a craving for ramen and you do not find them on the dinner or late night menu... no worries, just ask the server for their ramen menu and they'll be more than happy to prepare some for you and your friends/guests.  Pork Ramen with pork belly and shoulder, slow poached egg, scallions and seaweed was surprisingly good and satisfying. I like it when chefs are generous with a thick slice of pork belly and other goodies. The desserts, however, were sub-par. Both birthday cake and pumpkin cake were too sweet and lack flavors. Hopefully Momofuku will consider changing up the dessert menu and provide an all-satisfying experience from start to end.",

The pork was thick and juicy and was accompanied by a delightful sauce.  The ramen wasn't bad but I've definitely had better at a more reasonable price. They used the same pork belly and had no extras that ramen lovers are typically used to.  We wanted to try something different, so we had the fried chicken and caviar. The combination was delishhhh! The slice up the chicken and build the first taco/wrap for you. It came with sauce, a little bit of sliced cabbage, and crispy skin!  Last but not least, crack pie really is crack pie. Buttery and sweet... and pairs perfectly with their milk ice cream.   Check it out!",

My three girlfriends and I came here for dinner on a Saturday night and spent a whopping 5+ hours here sitting, eating, drinking, and talking.  I think that's kinda what David Chang would want his guests to experience.    We ordered a variety of buns - vegetarians, there's a shitake mushroom bun that's not on the menu, but our server mentioned that they could make it for me and I HIGHLY recommend - the peach burrata salad, noodles, rice cakes, the brussel sprouts & cauliflower and the shishito peppers, and lamb.  Everything was impeccable.  My favorites were the shitake mushroom bun, garlic and onion noodles, and the shishito peppers.  For dessert, we had the funfetti birthday cake and that my friends was the cherry on top of the perfect dinner.  Once our waiter noticed that we had befriended a nearby bachelor party, he also brought us over some chocolate truffles to go with our wine which was so kind of him.    The four of us had an unforgettable experience here, and even though three glasses of wine were broken and spilled in the process, the staff was so friendly and let us have so much fun well after we were done dining.    100% coming here the next time I'm in Vegas!!!",

The spicy cucumber was great, but we really loved the shishito peppers. For our main course, we ordered the duck, family style, the whole Hidori chicken and Ginger Scallion Noodles. The Duck was carved in front of us and it was amazing how our chef cut it perfectly. It was truly a spectacle. The duck was laid on a beautiful bed of rice topped with duck confit. Yum! The chicken was also very well spiced and flavorful and was complimented well by the noodles.  The duck bones were later fried with lots of spices and brought to our table soon after. A little salty for me personally, but definitely a crowd-pleaser. A special shout out to our waitress to whom we made a very odd request (de-boning the chicken). Sorry! We realized that was weird once she started. We just thought it would make it easier to share. For dessert, we got a few crack pies which I personally wasn't a fan of. I would easily skip the next time.  I would definitely recommend getting a reservation before reaching there. Vegas can be extremely busy, especially on holiday weekends.",

On a Saturday morning, a friend made a reservation for 6 and when we showed up on time we waited maybe 10 minutes to be seated. Our server was quick with water and specials of the day, which included a decadent truffle ramen and a $38/oz wagyu (unlimited ounces if you're interested). However, everyone in our party had one thing in mind: their fabled pork ramen. It did not disappoint. The noodles are thin, soft, and not over cooked, not really the star of the show. The broth is full of flavor but not fatty (this might disappoint tonkotsu ramen fans though). I could have done without the pulled pork but the chunk of solid pork was tender and juicy--just ultimate perfection. Interestingly, instead of an ajitsuke tamago style egg that's hard boiled with a jelly yolk, they went for a poached egg. A little sloppy when you eat but still yummy. Serving sizes are plenty.  Good times overall. Service is friendly and fast. The food may be a bit hyped at $17 per bowl, but it's a painless experience and good for groups.",

This is a wedding cake sized hunk of slow-cooked barbecue, a pork shoulder that is barely retaining its corporeal form when it makes its way onto the table.  This arrives with a whole stable of accompaniments, add a side of white steamed rice and you're cooking with gas!  You take the pork shoulder apart, mixing it in the drippings, wrap in lettuce, add Ssam sauce, kimchi, and wait for your eyes to roll back into your head.  They're not kidding about the party that this serves, so don't make any additional allowances for how much you can eat. You can always order more if it turns out that you do have the gastric fundus of a bull elephant.  The menu here is full of the playful, thoughtful food epiphanies that Chef Chang has had and expounded on over the years. It seems to me that the menu is crafted to play on flavor and the food memories associated with those flavors.  Take for example one of my favorite menu items, the cucumber salad.  This is chunks of kyuri tossed in a dressing that usually accompanies sea cucumber or jellyfish on a traditional Chinese restaurant \"cold plate\".  Usually the opening salvo in a traditional celebratory Chinese restaurant dinner like at a wedding or anniversary. So for me, this was both a little upsetting but also euphoria-inducing when my conscious brain finally wrested control from my reptilian mid-brain and I realized that this was cucumber and not sea cucumber.   An apparently simple dish that hid a wealth of thinking about food, an encyclopedic flavor vocabulary, and mad culinary skills.  I particularly appreciated the restraint in preparing a simple ingredient without going overboard to dress it up.  That same principle of just highlighting what nature has already made very good to eat and perfectly enjoyable permeates the entire menu.  I continue to be in awe of that kind of discipline, thoughtfulness, and love.  I absolutely loved it here and I hope you give Momofuku Las Vegas the time and attention that it deserves to truly understand and appreciate every nuance and suggestion, of which there is an abundance.",

It consists of a thick slice of pork belly, which was seared to perfection, a nice amount of hoisin sauce and garnish in a perfect steamed bun! I wish I didn't devour it in 2 bites because it was sooooo goooood!!   I also ordered the pork ramen, $18, (I should've ordered something else because I was already having the pork bun, but oh well) it was pretty good! The dish had a good amount of egg noodles topped with a handful of shredded pork, a slice of grilled pork belly, bean sprouts and green onions, and a perfect poached egg. The broth was smoky and flavored well! It is not a creamy type of broth like regular ramen.  I did not get to try the other dishes because I was just passing by, but it would be a really fun experience to come with a group and try their special dishes!   Service was 5/5! Our waiter was funny and welcoming! He also is very informative and explained the whole menu.",

Compared to other ramen places, Momofuku has a more classy atmosphere that illustrates an upscale mood. This classy environment also results in a pricier menu compared to your typical ramen place.   For my meal, I tried the pork belly bun, pork ramen, and bday truffles from Milk Bar. The pork belly bun's bun was quite soft and their pork belly and toppings were very flavorful. The pork ramen consists of a shoyu broth, which I typical don't get at ramen places, but I definitely think that the broth, noodles, and toppings were on point!  Their slow-boiled poached egg was as soft as a pillow and had a melt-in-your-mouth feeling! The bday truffles were quite sweet for me, so I took some of them home.   Since the dishes are quite pricy, this is not a place for those on a budget. For a special occasion or if you just want to try this place out, I definitely recommend this place!",

We were having the best time that night and we kind of ordered too much food to feed 6 people!! Haha! First up, cocktails! At $15-18 a pop we expected very damn good drinks!! I loved my Peruvian Sour, it was made perfectly! My friend ordered the Cherry Milk Punch, it was a bit strong for her (so I guess very generous with the rum), so then she ordered the Miso Mellow, which tasted better. Both was good, just depends on your taste. Next we had the Pork Belly Buns. OMG!! The BEST thing on the menu in my opinion!! Tender, juicy, fatty, tasty, all rolled up in a soft pancake white bun. So good we ordered 2 more orders. You must eat this, it will not disappoint!! Also try it with their sweet chili Korean Sauce for some added extra flavor!! I also ordered some raw oysters on the half shell topped with smoked trout roe, it was sooo good!! My main course was the Ginger Scallion Noodles with seaweed, mushrooms, scallions, cucumbers, & garlic. My noodles were perfect, and the flavors were great! I forgot to ask if the noodles were made fresh in house because they tasted homemade. Please let me know!! I'd definitely order this again. My friend had the Shoyu Pork Ramen Noodle soup bowl with a poached egg. From what I had sampled, it was flavorful & delicious as well. She finished that bowl clean before me and couldn't stop talking about it. The only thing she complained about was the noodles. She preferred them to be cooked a little longer, to be a little more tender. Maybe if they boiled it a little longer?? The total service was great! We were greeted & seated right away. We had Manny as our server and he was very attentive, nice, and friendly. Over all experience a 4! I'd return again and recommend this place whenever visiting Vegas. Keep up the great work you guys!!",

I ordered birthday cake truffles a la mode which isn't even on the menu. It was amazing. If you get the chance go! Its worth every penny.

Our waiter was constantly checking on us and our water kept on getting refilled without us asking.   Second, the food was spectacular! We started with the boiled eggs topped with smoke trout eggs and crispy rice; tasty but little overpriced. We had the oysters with melon ice that wasn't needed since oysters were fresh and sweet. The cold spicy noodles were flavorful. The Pork Buns though were amazing! We could have a meal with just those. And then our grand finale of the night was the Bo Ssam pork shoulder wraps with all the condiments... SUPER good!!! We got the small which fed 5 of us.",

Doesn't disappoint one bit. They've got the Johnnys Marg, the buns, the compost cookies, and of course the noodles. Everything you could want minus the Fuku sandwich!!!  Definitely doesn't stand up to Ko or Ssam bar but this is a great addition to the empire. People that haven't tried any of Chang's restaurants will be dying for more.   If you can plan ahead and have the group, get the Bo Ssam. You'd be a fool not to!",

    "text": "An absolute must visit when in Las Vegas. David Chang's new outpost in the Cosmopolitan brings several of his NYC menus together under one roof and does not disappoint.  This laid-back approach to high-fashion cuisine is about as good as it gets for the already crowded \"Asian fusion\" segment.  Set in a gorgeous new space with floor-to-ceiling windows in the main dining room, you'll want to start your meal off with something from the bar.  Innovative cocktails are pricey but boozy and flavourful, and there's an extensive wine and sake menu to choose from should you prefer to steer clear of the hard stuff.  If nothing strikes your fancy, ask Josh to dream something up - you won't be disappointed.  Menu standouts include the flavour packed fried softshell crab bun starter, the spicy rice cakes, mussels, and the whole seabass if you're into large format and dining with a group.  The aforementioned mussels dish really highlights the inventiveness of the menu - a dry roasted preparation with Benton's Bacon. My only lament is that the chilled spicy noodle has been tamed to an almost unrecognisable \"mild\" compared to Noodle Bar's original.  Dessert options are plentiful from the world-renowned Milk Bar menu.  People seem to love the Crack Pie but it's almost too rich for me.  I'll stick with the powered milk ball... preferably strawberry.",

We ordered the Ramen - really good flavor, the egg was super good Ginger and Scallion noodles - I think this was my favorite  Pork belly bun - wasn't that special, but decent Crispy potatoes - this was a surprisingly great dish.

However, I gave it a 4 stars based on the food I ordered ( wanted to give 3.5 stars but not an option) I might have had bigger expectations for this place. We ordered 5 things : oysters , spicy cucumbers , scallion pancakes , chicken bun & smothered Katsu chicken .   The oysters were ok. The spicy cucumbers were EXTREMELY salty and not spicy enough. We had to tell the waiter to take it away . The scallion pancakes were hard and not flakey like how it should be made . The chicken buns were the only thing I enjoyed :) perfectly crisp and delicious . The smothered Katsu chicken was extremely rich and salty . It was good the first few bites but way too heavy and doesn't come w rice or anything to help balance out the flavor. ( I would order the cream sauce on the side). Oh and the yuzu lemonade was delicious but a little too sweet !! I had to water mine down.   Overall, all the flavors were there but just way too rich, heavy or salty .. I would definitely give it another try and order completely different items although disappointing my first time .",

However, while the food was excellent, service was subpar.  The hostess outside was stone cold when we checked in for our reservation. No smile, nothing. We then got seated and a server checked in with us asking about water and letting us know she will take care of us tonight. So she leaves, we look over the menu and now we're waiting for her to come take our order. We see her right in front of us chatting it up with the table for a good 10 minutes or so. Meanwhile, we're just waiting for her, literally right behind her and she walks away to 2 other tables to check in with them. At this point, it's been about 15 mins since we sat down and no one has taken our order or checked in with us. I had to flag down a manager who grabbed someone to take our order.   The cucumbers and buns came out quickly. My friend and bf ordered the pork ramen, I ordered the summer truffle ramen. They were almost finished with their ramen before mine came out. The server apologized for the longer wait for my food. I wasn't sure if my ramen took longer to prepare, which if the server told me when I ordered, I would've been fine with.   A bit of a disappointing experience considering our experience in NY was way different.",

I can honestly say there improving with the food but as for the service SERIOUSLY SOMEONE NEEDS TO GET IT MORE ORGANIZED!!! or you can just hire a new manager that can train there employees to provide better service. I say your really killing the stars. Ill get to that later but lets start off with the food.   ----The FAMOUS buns: I tried the pork belly bun. my first time it was bad it was greasy I couldn't really taste anything besides the oil so bad it felt like I should of took my napkin and dabbed it off lol.. but as for the second time I visited it was PERFECT pork cooked real good and the toppings was just enough on the bun.  Chicken Karage first time there was so much spicy mayo I had to take a spoon took some off and it was good. But second time no complaints bun was on point. And love the pickled red onion blended very well with it.  I guess you can say and tell that the cooks who did it some seems like they do a sloppy job just for the money but others that does it so perfectly because they love doing what they do as a chef. And I heard they use to do one bun for $7 but now 2 buns for $7. I got charged wrong I'm guessing the FOH needs to be updated on whats going on.  ---- Oysters on the 1/2 shell (bonji mignonette)  love love love everything lol along with the yellowtail Sashimi (yuzu ponzu, basil, ginger) Cant go wrong with that.  ---- Noodles: Ginger Scallion Noodles && Pork Ramen There both okay I mean you really cant go wrong with ramen I just assume itd be different somehow someway but ramen is ramen.  ---- Smothered Katsu Chicken (Shitake gravy, black pepper) Yummy Yummy Yummy. the price for it sheesh no comment lol bit up there but its okay.  I'm assuming everytime you go and eat here the way the food tastes and is presented all depends on whos cooking it. overall the stars jus goes up and down for me.",

The front of the restaurant is all you see which is pretty cool and casual the tables have all barstools and there is a bar. We were told there would be a 20 min wait for the main dining room, so when our room was ready we walked to our table and as soon as you walk into the main dining room you see a transformation! It's this hip yet chic very New York feelin room. It's like you're dining right in the center of the strip with huge windows showcasing the strip. Now onto the food we had the pho and the jidori chicken which was served with kimchi and white rice. Everything was super tasty. I would definitely go back. Just keep in mind this restaurant is best for a larger group hence why there is a lazy Susan on every table. The prices reflect the large portions as well, but it's worth it.",

We started with the cucumber salad. It's just the right amount of spicy with a light refreshing taste. I could not stop eating it. We also had the pork belly bao & shrimp bao. Theses were so damn tasty! I could drop in for lunch and just eat these. The shrimp is spicy and the pork has a sweet sauce. They compliment each other nicely. We shared the ribeye. I thought this was a strange choice (birthday boy wanted it) for a well known Asian restaurant but STOP THE PRESS this was insane!! It was cooked to perfection with a beautiful salty crust (drooling again.) The fries and the aioli were so good we couldn't stop eating them. We had some red wine with the steak and everything in the world seemed alright. Somehow we still had room for crack pie which was good but nothing exciting. Best meal of our trip.",

We had a reservation for a weeknight, but the place wasn't filled and you would've been seated regardless. The menu is pretty limited, which saved us time on deciding what to get. Everything was very pricey though. We opted for shisito peppers, pork belly buns, brussel sprouts & cauliflower, grilled squid, grilled lamb ribs, ginger scallion noodles, and sichuan beef noodles.   My favorite was the pork belly bun. It was very fatty, and the sauce was yummy. The ginger scallion noodles would be my second, but it had a ton of seaweed and not much noodle to go around for a party of 5. I was most disappointed in the sichuan beef noodle. It didn't taste like much of anything to me. I was at least expecting a good peppercorn kick, but didn't get it.   The shisito peppers came with nutritional yeast on top, which I thought was fancy. Nothing else blew me out of the water. And for those prices, I expected as much.  Service was very good though. Our waters would be magically refilled by the attentive staff whenever it ran low.  All in all, I'm glad I came to check this place out for myself and would recommend others to do the same in order to form their own opinion. But there are so many other places to eat within the area that I would not be back.",

    "text": "This review has been a long time in the making. I have been to Momofuku 5 times now. It has been amazing every single time. I don't write reviews over and that is because I really have to feel passionate about the place I'm writing about. Momofuku and it's sister restaurant Majordomo in Los Angeles are two of my favorites from chef David Chang. Being an Asian American it's not too often we have chefs to look up to in the culinary world so when I learned of Momofuku I had to try it out.   The FOOD at Momofuku is Asian inspired and of the 5 times I have been here now, I have eaten family style 3 times. I can only comment on the dishes I have had here and fortunately for me I have been luck enough to have the 5 Spice Duck 3 times here. Yep...three times!!! That's 15 SPICES! I can't remember the different ways they prepare the duck because I am usually too entranced by the thought of eating it as well as being mesmerized by the carving process. The server will bring the duck out on a giant carving cart and proceed to carve up the duck breast in all its perfect delicious glory. They then take all the juices as well as the carved up meat and place it on top of a bed of crispy delicious rice. Oh my god the rice. Just typing R-I-C-E made me salivate! You are giving lettuce as well as what I like to think of as pancakes to make wraps out of. My personal favorite thing to do is to take a pancake first, remember to put the rice in first so that it sits at the bottom and soaks up the sauces that you put in. Speaking of sauces, you are giving Kimchi(gross...don't at me motherfuckers), ginger scallion sauce(MMMMM) and hoisin. Make sure you get a good scoop of rice, top it with duck confit and a few slices of the duck. Now, a good portion of ginger scallion sauce and hoisin and you got yourself what may be my favorite bite of food...ever...maybe? Seriously, the Duck here at Momofuku is fuku-ing a-MOMO-zing. They recommend 3-4 people to take on the duck challenge and that is about right depending on how hungry everyone is! Please make sure to order the duck if you ever have a larger party because it is SOOOOO GOOD!  I also really love the pork belly puns they have here! The pork is super tender and rich without being overly heavy or fatty. There is ssam sauce provided and I give the bun a good helping of it for every bite.   I've also had the jidori chimkin...I mean, chicken bowl here and it is pretty good but if I were to come back I'd certainly want to try the Ramen which I still haven't had here yet. The first couple of times I was here was for dinner and I didn't know that you can order it any time of day, it is just off menu so please ask your server. The times that I have seen people order the ramen it has looked good but I always think about how heavy ramen broth is and as I get older I realize that I am not always down for a giant bowl of oil and grease...yuck! Although if any place can make me temporarily not dislike ramen, it would be Momofuku!    Anyways, I hope anyone still reading this gathers a few of their favorite friends and comes to Momofuku to get the 5 Spice Duck! It is absolutely worth the price if you're a True lover of food!",

In the days where menus with multiple pages can be popular it's nice to arrive at a place that knows what they do well and offers a varietal selection without causing choice paralysis.  We opted to start with the spice cucumbers which were so good we quizzed our server on ingredients so we can try to make it at home!  Mains were the pork ramen, excellent, and the little gem salad (sunchokes) with spicy shrimp.  It's expert without trying.  Just delicious.  Attentive staff that sweetly celebrated our special occasion.  Very nice touch.  Pro Tip:  there is an elevated section of the dining room that has slanted windows overlooking the strip win and uninterrupted view.  Ask for a table there if you're looking to kick the experience up a notch.",

Today's food was far less than average and far less than a normal experience at Momofuku.  The pork belly buns were dry and the pork belly itself was tough. This never happens but today it did. They also refused to fix this for me or attempt to make another.  The spicy chicken sandwich was below average as well. The chicken was hard and the sauce had 0 flavor. Weak \"spicy\" sandwich to say the least.  Lastly, the ramen. The ramen had the same issue as the pork bun. Even after being left in the broth for nearly 15 minutes it was still not good.   Today's dinner was below average and below a normal dinner here. If this were my first time I would not come back, but I will give it another shot.",

The what the pho cocktail was unlike any I've tasted before, initially I was not a fan but grew to like it as I sipped it more. The ramen was solid, I typically prefer very flavorful ramen with lots of toppings, this was more of a basic ramen. Love Milk bar next door which they serve a limited menu of here in the restaurant which can save a long wait.",

Was in Vegas for work recently and met up with my parents and I decided to treat them for a belated Mother's Day and early Father's Day. We made reservations prior and I recommend you do that as well or you'll be waiting for a while.  The ambiance is very modern, with a lot of wall art that makes the place seem very hip, which it is.  All plates are shared, and though I loved all the dishes we got, my top 3 were definitely the sea bass, the pork buns, and the squid.   Other menu items we ordered: oysters, apple salad, black truffle ramen.  The servers there are very knowledgeable about their dishes as well, which really helped us enjoy the meal even more.   This is a meal I won't forget.",

The Bass was cooked perfectly as it was tender that had a good charr on the skin. The bossam rice was what made this experienced a 3 instead of 4. IMO the rice was too sauced and as a result was too overly sweet and salty. With such a distinction as this establishment i was disappointed in how the dish came out. Sake, fish, and service given was the reason the review was not a 2.",

When we walked up to the hostess booth, they seated us at the bar where the chefs are, but one of the waiters noticed my bf looking into the dining area and offered to seat us inside, so we got lunch with a view w/o reservations! :)   We, of course, had to order some staples we loved on our first visit: Pork Belly Buns and Milk Bar Pie (formerly Crack Pie). We also ordered the Shoyo Pork Ramen and Bo Ssam Rice Bowl to try this time. The Shoyu Ramen had a very smokey flavor, I loved the pork shoulder, but the pork belly with the ramen is not as good as the pork belly buns, since it got soggy from the broth. The Bo Ssam Rice Bowl was delicious, my bf and I both thought of it as comfort food. If I had to choose which of these 2 dishes to order again next  time, it would be the rice bowl.  FYI - Cosmopolitan has self parking rates: Free within 1 hour, $10 for 1-4 hours, and $15 for the day.",

My husband & I love Momofuku and have been to other restaurants of David Changs. So while in Vegas we decided to bring my brother and his girlfriend who had never been.  We started with the Pork Buns which were just melt in your mouth good and the Asparagus which they say was delicious.  We decided to share the Snake River Farms Wagyu Bavette. It was 36 ounces of beef, fried corn \"ribs\" & a kimchi potato salad. What a presentation that was. My husband and I have been to Japan and had the actual Wagyu beef over there and he says this is probably the best he's had (here at least) since Japan. Though it's not like we eat it much so take that with a grain of salt. hah. There was so much food I have no idea how 4 of us finished it.  Also there was an earthquake and that's super interesting watching all the fancy ceiling fixtures move around. As East coasters, we don't ever experience anything like that, so it was nice seeing the servers act super chill about it.  Our server, whos name I wish I remembered, was very attentive, friendly, and just overall great. We even saw the manager talk with the table next to us over a mess up and it really seems like they have their customer service aspect down solid.  Bathrooms were weird because there's only 2 BUT THEY HAVE BIDETS which is always nice so that's a plus in my life.  Can't wait to come back for our next trip to Vegas!",

Chill, laid back, casual type of lunch or dinner place for any time of the day in Las Vegas. Even though its warm out, this warm bowl of ramen totally hit the spot. I ordered the shoyu pork ramen. The pork is so soft that it almost melts as you pick it up. I also love the fact that it has never been too fatty. The noodles are cooked to perfection. They have the right chewiness along with the incredible flavor that Momofuku has to offer. The broth.. thats where it's at. The broth is flavorful, smokey, and not greasy.  I get that at $18 for a bowl of ramen can be a bit much but the quality of it is so worth it. One day though, when Vegas is being kind to me, I will order the Truffle Ramen Bowl...$50 is a bit hefty for me but I sooo want to try it. Momofuku!! I'll be back. Let's hope the waiters don't recognize me and start calling me the ramen girl.. although that too would be pretty sweet.",

The vibe of the restaurant is casual and fun and our server was amazing, her cocktail recommendations were on spot. And if you're not familiar with Momofuku or with various cuisines from Asia, I would say the restaurant has a nice and balanced menu selection for newcomers. It doesn't hurt that their cocktail selections are ! Side note: the Milk Bar is located right next door so you can take your cereal milk soft serve to go.",

We ordered up a batch of these little buns, and Yup, she was right on the money! A hearty slab of meaty pork belly, house made pickle, tucked inside a pillow of tender buns! Best bet we made all night!   The Raman is really good as well! We ordered the pork Raman, and the ginger and scallion Raman! The broth was delicious and loaded with noodles!",

I have no issues with service here.   Quality: this is the main reason why this place gets two stars. You are paying for an atmosphere that isn't real. The food is not worth the price point they set it at. Their appetizers like the pork bun and shishito peppers were very delicious, but that is about it. I HIGHLY DO NOT RECOMMEND eating here for a date or family dinner. It is definitely not worth the money. Our ramen was very basic and nothing special. The chick peas ramen is pretty good but not for its price point. my lamb with their special sauce was kind of rubbery and I only ate one lamb rib. They don't have much spicy flavors, everything is very sweet. Also the portions aren't very large. The bo saam rice was sooo sweet and almost unpleasant. the oysters were also poorly shucked and had shell pieces in it. They also don't have tapatio or tabasco for the oysters. They do have their own sauce, but again it is on the sweet side.  Cleanliness: no issues here. Everything very clean and presentable.  Overall: this is definitely not a place for me. It was nice to try once, but only once. Sadly I will not recommend this to people, just feels like a waste of money, for their small menu options and almost no variations. Pretty upsetting",

Our table shared a few dishes, starting with spicy cucumbers which were so crunchy and had a nice kick. We also had the Brussel sprouts (which had a great char on them) and the country ham (paired with a coffee mayo - such a strangely delicious combo!).   Then came the pork belly buns and beef Sichuan noodles. Both of those were absolutely the star of the evening for me. Get them! The pork belly was perfectly cooked - tender in the middle and crisp around the edges. The beef Sichuan noodles were spicy, and I absolutely loved it. I'll be dreaming of those noodles for many months.",

Every item was well thought out to the details of portion sizes and robust flavor.    A must try for the appetizer are the pork belly buns. The pork is cooked to perfection and melts in your mouth in addition with a perfectly cooked bun with a great balance of hoisin with crunch of pickled cucumber (tsukemono). The crispy potatoes were cooked perfectly and addicting. They look spicy , but it's more sweet with nice crunchy garlic crunch. The shishito peppers were roasted well, but lacking overall, they needed another element to accompany them other than a lime salt topping.    The Black Truffle Ramen is a must try if you don't mind spending $50. It's a bucket list type of food to try. It's on its own level with the richness the truffle  to be broth, which is the perfect balance without  being too overpowering. The aftertaste is pleasing and lasts a while to further savor and enjoy the experience.   The Lamb ribs were tender and juicy and fell off the bone accompanied with the perfect mixture of a cucumber chili yogurt.   Momofuku is a must try and even the bathrooms are nice as they can get and have fancy Japanese toilets!",

The fatty broth was delicious, there was tons of scallions, a runny egg and a piece of seaweed to accompany the al dente noodles. I highly recommend that bowl as well as the Ginger Scallion noodles & the infamous Bao buns. The Ginger Scallion noodles had pickled shiitake mushrooms and cucumbers that gave the bowl depth and flavor. As for the buns, there's a good pork belly to bun ratio for the $7 bao. The shrimp bun was very crispy. Im sure everyone is ranting about these dishes and in my opinion they were great choices that filled two of us up for dinner.   I had an amazing experience while dining at Momofuku on Sunday and will be back. While you're at it, pick up the Crack Pie from the nearby Milk Bar. It's to die for!",

At first look of the menu, my jaw dropped. $50 for a darn plate of salmon?!? Holy Cannoli! Hard pass.  The menu was very pricey, with the exception of noodles. As a girl who likes to do Vegas on a somewhat reasonable budget, I got the ginger scallion noodles for $15.   I was worried that the dish would be too small, given the lower price point compared to the rest of the menu items. To my surprise, it was a perfectly sized dish (I was unable to finish the bowl. Most of my friends devoured their bowls, and we were all very full and happy afterwards).   The Ginger Scallion Noodles came in a bowl with a big lump of thick and perfectly cooked noodles, some incredibly tasty mushrooms, seasoned seaweed, of course...scallions, etc. For such a simple plate, the flavors merged together very nicely to make a delicious noodle dish.   Hint: Make sure you specify tap water when ordering or they will pour you some fancy bottled water and surprise you with some charges on the bill!",

Living in NYC, I'm a big fan of Momofuku so my colleague and I went for dinner on our second night.  It's a very large restaurant and has a great aesthetic.  It was packed out and that was to be expected.  We were seated at the bar and were helped right away.  The tab was on the job...so we ordered quite a bit. My colleague was a little more experienced with the menu so he ordered for the two of us and we basically shared everything.  The Pork chop was my absolute favorite.  Flavorful and really hit the spot after a long day of walking around Vegas.  Went really well with the Long Beans.  The noodles to me were a little strange but definitely not bad.  If I remember correctly, they had a little kick to them so make sure you're ok with spicy food.",

    "text": "I enjoyed my dinner experience at Momofuku but nothing I had was exceptional other than the price.  On entry Momofuku feels like a slightly more tasteful version of lots of other hip Asian cuisine restaurants you've been in for the last decade: street vibes, street painting, 90's era hip-hop and breakbeats; DJ Shadow and Jurassic 5 must make a fortune off royalties from these places.  Normally I'm not too concerned with price but it's hard not to notice kimchi short rib stew for 48 US dollars. I love this soup but damn, this had better be the best soup I've had in my entire life. Seemingly more appropriate was the Bo Ssam - even though it was around 168 my assumption was that this was going to be a massive amount of food (and it lived up to expectations!)  Our table tried some of the pork buns. These were O.K. There was definitely a generous amount of pork belly in each but the flavor was pretty flat. This began the first of many applications of the Ssam sauce which was both delicious and essential for most of what we ate.  Next up was the Kimchi Stew. This was the star of the show and for a moment made me forget that I'd paid nearly 50 bucks for stew. The short rib itself was O.K. but really the special thing about this was the combination of the perfect kimchi stew flavor with cheesy, gooey burrata - turns out this was much better than just dropping an American cheese slice in there.  The Ssam was huge and probably more than we should have ordered.  But that hugeness didn't come with huge flavor and I found this dish more than the others really required generous helpings of the Ssam sauce. I felt like I was doing the equivalent of liberally dousing a steak with A1 because the meat itself wasn't that special.   Overall I'm not too excited to return here for dinner even though the vibe was quite nice and the service was very good. Maybe I'll try the lunch?",

The ceviche canape and Shishito peppers were the best dishes. They forgot to switch on the lights at the group dining until we requested for it. Kind of odd. It was also too pricey based on overall quality of the food.",

    "text": "Highly recommend - probably one of my favorite restaurants...ever.  I went to Momofuku on my first night in Vegas on my most recent trip and sat at the noodle counter. It was a Thursday evening and I had no trouble getting a seat quickly. I'm glad I sat at the noodle bar because I was by myself and enjoyed watching the kitchen work.  I started with the serrano peppers and had the black truffle ramen for dinner. The peppers. WOW. So delicious - and so simple! I can't believe they are as good as they are. I was also so so happy that I was able to eat the peppers. I have a severe shellfish allergy and often can't have fried food because the food either goes in the same frier as shrimp, or the friers are too close together. I told them about my allergy and they used a special frier just for those people who have allergies! It was so cool that the restaurant thought through something like allergies.  When the black truffle ramen arrived I thought it looked beautiful and the smell - amazing! but then I took a bite. I was floored. Easily the best bowl of ramen I have had (and absolutely worth the $$$). Am I allowed to say I almost got teary eyed over this ramen??? well, i kept it together, but only just. It is a must try and I can't wait to have that bowl again.  I was so blown away that I returned to momofuku two more times on my weekend trip. I got the chick pea ramen (twice) and the cucumber appetizer (once). The chick pea ramen was so so good! and vegetarian! I was so surprised at how flavorful it was. I could easily eat that daily. The cucumbers were also very very good. They were fresh and sliced thinly and tossed in a spicy (ish) sauce/seasoning. I'm looking forward to my next trip to Vegas (or New York) to eat at momofuku again.  I also got the crack pie (which comes from milk bar next door) for dessert one of my visits here. I ordered it with the cereal milk ice cream. The pie was amazing. The ice cream, I was take it or leave it on. Maybe if I was less full I would have enjoyed it more, but I was so stuffed from dinner that I prioritized the pie.  Overall, I don't think I can give a higher recommendation than the one I give for momofuku - you must eat here.",

He chickpeas were crispy and added a nice texture to the soup.  The noodles were tender.  I wish there were more vegetables in the bowl.  It had bok Choy but I would have liked more.  The broth is a warm smoky spice and added veggies would have given it some variation.  I also had the shishito peppers as an appetizer.  They had a hint of lime and were very good.  The drink I had was a Jalapeno honey infused concoction that had a good bit of heat.  The taste reminded me of tequila but there was none in it.  This was very good but if you don't like spice it's not for you.",

Not having much time to stay and try everything, we kept it simple and just ordered the Shoyu Pork ramen and Pork Belly buns. This was the most tender, buttery pork belly I've ever had, that we ended up ordering seconds. Of course, try everything with the spicy sauce! If you have room for dessert, you can choose from a short Milk Bar \"fan favorites\" menu, or just head over next door to order at Milk Bar directly for the full menu options.  I would love to visit again to try the dinner menu.",

I read lots of mixed reviews around this restaurant and but that didn't keep me away. I was too curious and I'll just say I wasn't disappointed. I do think that people have hyped this place up a lot. That can easily change your view on a place.  I loved the take on his cuisine and how it was presented. The food was rich and felt inviting with each bite. Every bite got better and better throughout my meal. I started off with the pork bun.  I love pork bao in general. This pork belly bun was just so flavorful yet simplistic. I used the Korean chili sauce in everything to spice it up and I want that sauce for myself to have at home!   My shoyu pork ramen was also delicious and very flavorful. Things are a bit more simplistic than other ramens I've had. This was nice and clean broth with tons of pork. The noodles were cooked perfectly and that egg yolk...so much yes! Yolky is the way to go in ramen for me.   The pork was the spotlight for me. The only thing that was a little less than desired was the beans. They seemed to be overcooked and less fresh. The presentation on that dish could be much better.   Overall, I was pleasantly surprised and would come back. Especially for the buns!",

I have to admit the broth with truffle in it tasted very rich and great - it did feel a little bit heavy though. I would really like to try those huge dishes like lobster stuffs- but these are for large group of people. The pork bun tasted ok, I didn't feel that special. They sometimes have hidden menu depends on the season - you really need to ask the waiter and you might get a surprise :)",

And rest of the staff was excellent; they refilled our water promptly, refreshed plates, also refreshed napkins when my son's napkin got a little messy. -All the proteins were perfectly cooked. We had steak, pork belly, cod, and chicken. All of them were moist and tender or buttery.  Things I liked: -Miso Black Cod: the fish was moist, buttery and melt in my mouth. The bok choy was pretty good, it soaked up the broth. -Whole Jidori chicken: big flavor seasoning on the chicken with a little crunchiness outside. The whole chicken was very tender and moist, even the white meat was moist. The Kimchi was tasty. -Australian Wagyu Steak: the meat was perfectly cook very tender. Our server suggested to eat the dish like a lettuce wrap. The flavor was good and tasted better eating all of the ingredients all at once in the wrap. And the rice was fine. -Pork Ramen: the noodle was good, nice firm texture, and the broth was solid. The pork was soft and tender. It was different that the bowl came with slide pork and shredded pork. -Pork Belly Bun: it served with a big piece of pork belly. The pork was a little crispy outside and very tender when bit into the meat. Flavor wise was fine, similar to many other pork belly buns I had in the past.  Thing that just okay: -Oyster: the oysters were just okay, definitely I had many better ones before, but the smoked trout roe in the sauce was good.  Overall I was a little disappointed. I had high expectations. I didn't have a bad dish, but didn't have any amazing dish neither.",

I'm sure if I went to the New York location it would have been a totally better experience   My service was very good.  The restaurant had a great feel to it.  I had a fantastic seat at the Kitchen bar.   My first dish was big eye tuna with strawberries and shaved foie gra.  This first plate was outstanding.  Best dish I ordered.    Second plate was a Burrata and black truffle with black kale salad with sourdough.   At first all I saw was kale.  But under the pile of kale was the Burrata and I'm assuming truffle oil.  I kinda decided to toss my salad with what little Burrata there was   My main was a cedar planked salmon with sunflower risotto and tamp-era corn kernels.   The best part of the plate was everything except the salmon.   I felt it was over cooked and a bit dry.   Dessert I ordered crack cake from milk it was amazing   I would try this place one more time but I think I would do the steam bun and the noodle dish.  Maybe the rib. Those seemed to be ask for a lot  I do want to recognize that momofuku did reach out to me about my review. Victor was very kind and offered to make a reservation for a re visit.   Also mentioned talking to the chef.  I do appreciate such efforts.  Thank you victor",

We ordered shoyu and soba ramen, shoyu ramen was not good, the broth did taste strange, the noodles too soft and the toppings not impressive. The spicy cold soba another disappointment. I understand they are putting a twist, most of the time I like innovation but I did not get it. There other ramen joints in town I pay half of the price and they are very satisfying.",

    "text": "My sister has been an avid David Chang follower for years now, and this was her dream spot for lunch! We came out here right at opening time on a Saturday morning, and were not disappointed. What the pho cocktail was a very interesting taste, but not very reminiscent of a bowl of pho. I understood some of the ingredients used, like jalapenos and basil, but the cocktail itself had qualities that were more sour than what you would expect in a bowl of pho. I got the bo ssam rice bowl with a poached egg, and it was a revelation. The kimchi rice underneath a hearty serving of pork shoulder with all the classic Korean sides was a perfect marriage of flavors. We also got the sweet and sour long beans, which were sauteed to perfection (just the right amount of bite to the beans so they weren't a soggy mess), along with the Denver steak, Duck Confit Fried Rice, and the chef's special (crispy chicken leg served on top of a bed of veg). Our server was hands down one of the most well-informed, accommodating and friendly servers we experienced while staying in Vegas. He was passionate about food and informing us guests about the menu, which made it so much easier for us to order!  I'm glad my sister made reservations for this place! It was a fantastic experience.",

Started off with crispy potato appetizer ($12). It was a good starter, potatoes had nice seasoning to it and was definitely crispy.  Ordered the Pork Ramen ($17). The pork was soft, flavorful, and delicious. The ramen and broth however was very bland. The broth had no flavor to it.   Took a long time for food to come out, especially since they were a little busy.",

Overall, servers are very friendly but service is on the slow side. It took 20 minutes for us to meet our server and food came out very slowly.   I tried the shiitake buns which were very yummy; the sauce gave it a slight kick and contrasted the hoisin sauce, in a good way! I ordered the ginger scallion noodles and while I'm not a huge fan of ginger, the ginger flavor isn't too strong. Flavor overall was mild, tasted very light and clean. Personally felt like the toppings were a bit much in terms of ratio to the noodles.   I also tried a bit of the katsu chicken and loved it. Strong shiitake flavor, chicken was tender, but gravy made it a bit heavy.",

Passing other patrons in crowded seating areas, we were seated in the only window seating with a clear view of Paris and the Eiffel Tower!  Manny the waiter was patient with us and had many recommendations.  Since we had experienced Majordomo down in LA and I watched all eight episodes of Ugly Delicious, I felt competent enough to understand what we might like, and try.  I thought we might try the pork ssam sauce entree, but was persuaded to try the beef ribs, which I was conflicted over, as I could have it in Los Angeles, but I caved in and wanted the evening to be memorable, as we were with my daughter's Fiance, and celebrating her birthday.  Something not offered  was the Korean Elote, with the fusion of Mexican corn tastes, with Korean style heat and vegetables which made for a lovely taste all the way down.   When dining at a David Chang restaurant, always try the fish, which is cooked perfectly and tasty, with hints of spice you just can't place, but delicious with fish.  At this particular location, it was the whole Branzino with a grilled lemon in the head and de-boned.  A very delicious dish.  The overall evening was perfect, with a 9:00 reservation and seated almost immediately.  If you get a chance, try to get a table with Manny the waiter!",

It may look small from the outside but there is a whole separate (really big) dining room in the back.   So happy they opened up in Vegas. If you win big money at the casino, you can splurge on the $$$ ramen. It was too costly for me to try but I'm sure it's fabulous.   My favorite dish of the whole weekend for me was momo's scallop ceviche. Pretty awesome.",

    "text": "I heard alot of hype about this place but my overrall experience was interesting. Momofuku definitely stands out and has a unique twist to all their food. This is not a sushi/sashimi place. And I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone who likes to stick to safe choices- burgers, sandwiches, sushi etc.  I heard it was mainly known for its ramen, however they did not have the pork belly ramen on the dinner menu so we were all confused. But when we asked they said they do offer the pork belly ramen...So..a little confused as to why a popular dish wasn't on the menu? And they didn't have alot of choices of ramen either. Most of us ordered the pork belly ramen and ordered lots of appetizers:  -Pork belly ramen: The broth was a little salty, the pork belly was very soft and easy to chew. The noodles were okay, there was nothing \"wow\" about it. The buns tasted bland. -Pork belly buns- Again the pork belly was tender and good, but eating it with the bun was just a fail. The pork belly was too big to eat with the bun, it would've been easier if the meat was cut in smaller pieces maybe? - Shrimp buns: Shrimp buns were a little easier to eat but again it kept falling out as we tried taking a bite. The shrimp was good though with a nice sweet sauce. -Spicy rice cakes: The rice cakes are actually fried and diced into squares. It doesn't taste like korean spicy rice cakes but it a sweet slight soy sauce type of flavor that was pretty good. -Hamachi: THIS was probably my favorite small plate. It was soft and the cucumbers really complimented the fresh taste. I wish they gave abigger serving of the hamachi. It's $24 for a tiny plate! -Shishito Peppers: When I got a waft of the peppers it gave off that feeling where you can feel the spiciness with your eyes. But when I took a bite, I didn't taste anything! It felt like I was eating steamed peppers, and I couldn't taste the lime or saltiness. My boss disagreed, but must be just my tastebudz. -Crispy Potatoes: My second favorite item on the menu. So good. These were basically roasted potatoes but grated cheese and green onions. Nicely seasoned and crispy on the outside, soft and hot on the inside. I wished I was eating this with breakfast, not ramen...  There's a couple more plates we ordered but I didn't try them.  Overrall the food was interesting. My gripe about this place is that the food is unique but these small plates would be great compliments to other foods that they don't offer or are too expensive. The crispy potatoes would be great with the rotisserie prime rib, if only that wasn't $72...  Service was prompt and efficient. The waiter was attentive and came around to always refill our waters which I really appreciated. Most convenient part was the lazy susan. However the prices here are just mad. $14 for a small pickle plate? Nah. Will I come back here? Probably not, but I'm glad I tried it.",

If you're complaining about price, you should probably not be in Vegas.   Moving along, wow, ambiance is sleek. And you have a nice view of outside too, which was unexpected but lovely. The wait staff is extremely attentive- I don't think my water cup was ever less than half full and I was definitely taken care of. Almost too much attention, honestly.  Food was good! We aren't the biggest morning-after-a-heavy-night-of-drinking eaters, so spare us in that we didn't try too much:  ginger scallion noodles: these would have been good, but goodness, the cucumbers are wayyyy too salty. Everything else was good tho, so I just ended up avoiding eating the cucumbers tbh.   chicken buns: these were amazing. I would go back and just order these until I wanted to throw up. Huge fan.",

So really happy he opened something in Las Vegas and was finally ably to try his food. Pro tip: we went for lunch on a Friday and had no wait time. The lunch menu also has rice bowls which are pretty reasonable (less than $20 and big servings).  There's a reason why people love his food. It's so darn tasty! Our group tried the shishito peppers, spicy pickles, and lamb ribs to start. Awesome to say the least. Warning: the spicy pickles are searing hot even for us veteran Asians. Would avoid for the faint of heart.   I got the Bo Ssam bowl and man, it was delicious. My wife got the famed Shoyu Ramen and it also did not disappoint. Of course, we also tried the pork buns. I think I could've eaten two more of those things they were so good.  Service was also very on point. Place has a chic modern vibe with David Choe art on the walls. And convenient location if you are staying in the Aria, Cosmo, Vdara complex. Anyway, one of the few places which has lived up to the hype IMO.",

    "text": "I really wanted to like this place because I have heard good things from different people. Unfortunately our first experience will hinder us from coming back.   It was our very first day in Vegas, our first meal in Vegas, and our FIRST TIME in Vegas. (no pressure) We were staying at the Cosmopolitan and side note the hotel was amazing. Definitely coming back for the hotel. We got at the restaurant mid afternoon. There was no line and they were not busy. I would say this is best time to come in.  Our server was knowledgeable of the menu. We told her it was our first time in the restaurant and asked for recommendations. I wanted ramen so bad but they only have two options for hot ramen. I saw the duck entree but didn't think twice because I don't eat duck. When the server gave us a gist of the menu, one that she recommended was the duck. So here I go again with, \"When in Vegas\" I tried something new, for the very first time. We ordered two appetizers to share, chilled brussel sprouts and crack potatoes. The brussels were good palate cleanser. They were light and didn't have an overwhelming flavor. The crack potatoes were addicting. They were crack alright. We also ordered the their famous bun, both pork and shrimp. They were delicious but for the portion I thought it was pricy. My girlfriend was excited because she can't eat duck around me because I don't eat it.   Now with all the build up, we were excited for the duck. Everything so far has been tasty. Until the duck came. I took the first bite and all I could taste was salt. In my head I thought \"this is how it's supposed to taste.\" So I got a little bit of the rice underneath to eat it with. To my horror the rice was salty too. Everything was so so salty. Working in hospitality in the F&B I try not to send food back. But this dish was so overwhelmingly salty I had to. We flagged our server down and told her that the dish was salty. She apologized and told us she will let the chef know. She also told us that she was either going to make a new one or have us order something else on the menu.   We waited patiently.   She came back and told us the Chef was informed and is already making a new one. (What happened to us ordering something else instead? Do we not get that option anymore?) I said thank you and the server walked away. My girlfriend and I had a little discussion and concluded that we no longer want to eat anymore because 1.We didn't have a choice whether we still want the duck and 2. we lost our appetite. We called our server and asked whether it was too late. She said she rang it in as soon as she returned the duck. She said she will go back and check. She came back to our table with the duck plate in hand. We stared at the dish and my girlfriend and I just looked at each other.   By this point we just wanted to leave. We didn't touch the plate. The server came back and asked what was wrong with it. We said we weren't hungry anymore and if would could just have it boxed. We paid and still left twenty percent tip. We're not mean people, we just didn't enjoy the experience at all particularly our first meal in Vegas.",

What's the point of asking if we're celebrating a special occasion when you're just going to forget about it and not do anything?  I will say their pork in general was really juicy but the slow service and lack of attention ruined our experience.    Our baos and appetizers came out fairly quickly and we ended up waiting half an hour for our ramen and ssam to come out.  They did give us some extra appetizers, but after thirty minutes of waiting, I wasn't really hungry anymore.    Pork bao was juicy and fatty, but for $7 I expected a bigger bun.    Brussel Sprouts & Cauliflower was bitter AF and burnt.  The worst thing we ordered.    The pork ramen was not worth the wait and most of us didn't finish it.  If you've ever had ramen in Japan, just don't bother coming here.  You'll be unimpressed.  The Pork Ssam was recommended by our server.  The pork was tender but the thing came with literally three lettuce wraps.  Someone needs to tell their chef to check the pork to lettuce ratio.  It also came with some rice and kimchi.  We didn't even finish this dish because we were all full because of the wait.",

I was super excited when I stumbled across Momofuku on Yelp yesterday, I've been to the New York milk bar but not any of his restaurants in other cities. I was considering dining here for dinner tonight so I stopped by earlier when I was in the cosmopolitan.  You can stop by the milk bar and just do take out dessert which was great. I bought a cornflake chocolate chip cookie for $3, and it was fantastic. They have shakes, other cookies, and other types of desserts as well, I believe they have alcoholic milkshakes too. The counter girl was helpful in helping me determine what kind of cookie to buy, also. She said that they opened around the beginning of 2017 too so they've only been open about three months.  I definitely will be back! Their desserts are so tasty.",

    "text": "YUM! After watching Ugly Delicious on Netflix I knew I had to check out David Chang's restaurant in Vegas. My boyfriend and I went here for lunch around 11 on a Sunday. Even though we didn't have a reservation we were seated right away at the bar which was perfect because we got to have an inside look of the kitchen. I noticed they also have seating with a strip view so if you want to have lunch or dinner with a view of the strip I recommend making a reservation and requesting that. Service was really good and we both said we would come again. My boyfriend and I both ordered the shoyu pork ramen and it was so good! The ramen includes pork belly and pork shoulder and a nice slow poached egg. The ramen is garnished with scallions, nori, cooked soybeans, and narutomaki. The ramen broth was very flavorful and the noodles were cooked perfectly. The pork belly was melt in your mouth delicious. You get a lot of pork meat which was nice since the ramen is $17 a bowl. I noticed they also have chick pea ramen if you're a vegetarian. While sitting at the bar we were able to see them make ssam with rotisserie chicken and the 5 spice rotisserie duck. Both looked so delicious! The ssam meals are served with bibb lettuce and rice for wrapping and are easily shareable. The duck looked simply heavenly. You can get the duck with the ssam meal or as a large format meal for 3-4 people (keep in mind that it's $200 if you do the large format). Besides the ramen, most other things on the menu are definitely Vegas priced. If you have the money to spend or want to treat yourself for a special occasion check this place out.",

I had the pork ramen, which features tender shredded pork and pork belly in a silky broth with stretchy ramen noodles. The chili oil addition is mildly spicy and the shiitake addition is pickled. The bowl made me feel healthier and happier. It is the best ramen.   My dining companion went for a truffle special ramen with 6oz of shaved French truffle. It had a little bit of a bigger noodle and had a delicate flavor of truffle. She loved it. I would never order it, because how could I order anything other than the pork ramen?",

As an Asian American who has traveled quite extensively over the years, I can tell you the quality of the meal I had tonight will never make it there on its first day.. oh and that bearded hipster manger guy just stands there looking pretty and does nothing.. sigh!

    "text": "I am very sad to write this but I was really looking to coming here as I visited Momofuku in New York a few years ago and had there Ramen and was so amazing,well good news I live in Cali and heard they opened one in Vegas in the Cosmopolitan hotel, so of course I booked a flight to come to Vegas, made a reservation at Momofuku. I have mix reviews, I had a reservation at 6:30 pm but was late by 25 minutes due to traffic on the strip, but the hostess said don't worry we will have a table for you, so great customer service there, so remember the whole reason I wanted to come to Momofuku was for the Pork belly ramen, well the waiter sat us I looked at the menu and they didn't have it, so sad face for me, I asked the waiter may I order the pork belly ramen and he said no it's only for lunch or late Night, well I ordered some other things I really didn't want like the $58 buck rotisserie chicken but I didn't want to leave cuz I was Already there, so a few moments later the next table had pork ramen being served to them, my waiters switched and I was Just disappointed, because of what I would have ordered due to what he said I couldn't order, the 2nd waiter did give us the pork belly ramen and said even though it's not on the menu you can ask for it, but I did earlier but the first waiter said I couldn't , anyways there was another mix up where I ordered 2 pork baos too and I never got them u till the end of the service because I asked if we Did order them and he said yes... hmmm I'm just disappointed not the best  first impression for the people I brought after I was hyping it up, I am just kinda upset cause I feel I overpaid $58 bucks for the chicken that was dry where i could have gotten it at  costco for 4.99. I'm here until Mon so we will see if give it go :(  Rika was nice and addressed my concerns and the customer service was great so I am changing it to a 3 do to there efforts of making the customer happy",

No. Nope. I must have come on an off day. Today must be kitchen try-outs. Probably? I hope so.   The place looks nice, expertly decorated. The music during lunch is way to loud. No, I'm not that old.   I think I'll grab some \"Top Ramen\" on the way home.",

We had the Bigeye Tuna, Spicy Cucumbers, Shishito Peppers, Pork Belly Buns, Sichuan Lamb Ribs, Chilled Spicy Noodles and the Steamed Whole Branzino.   Bigeye Tuna was my favorite. The shaved foie gras melted in my mouth and paired well with the tuna and strawberries.   Spicy cucumbers were chopped thick and had togarashi on it and was a great take on the cucumbers you would get at a sushi bar.   Pork Belly Bun was the perfect amount of bun to meat. The pork belly was well-seasoned and had scallion and cucumber in it.   The lamb ribs were savory and had a sauce on it similar to a tzatziki sauce on it.   The chilled spicy noodles were spicy, but not to the point that you couldn't taste the other flavors. It had sausage, and cashews in it. The sauce was like a pesto, but basil flavored.   My hubby loved the branzino. He usually doesn't like whole fish, but I think that was his favorite. It came with a grilled lemon and brown butter dashi. The dashi was so unctuous and really made the fish delicious.   Danny and Ricky(?) were at the bar serving everyone and gave us spectacular service. We will be back.",

My girlfriend and I are vegan, and I was worried that there wouldn't be enough plant-based options on the menu to offer a filling, satisfying meal. After reading some reviews where people mentioned that there are a few plant-based options on the menu, and the kitchen can make modifications to accommodate vegan diners, I decided to make Momofuku our dinner choice.  Been a fan of David Chang for a while and have always heard good things about his restaurants, so I was really excited to finally have an opportunity to dine at Momofuku.  I made the reservation through OpenTable and specified that we were looking for an all vegan meal. The hostess acknowledged our request at check-in, and our server was very knowledgeable breaking down our available options, and telling us what items could be modified to fit our dietary needs.  We came in at 930pm on a Thursday, and even with the reservation there was a short wait, but it wasn't a big deal. Just gave us an opportunity to grab some drinks at the bar. The bartender was great. Gave us menus and water the minute we sat down. Very attentive.   The hostess sat us in a corner both along the Strip. We had windows that wrapped around that gave us a great view of the Strip with the \"Eiffel Tower\" in the background. Had a view of the entire restaurant from that perspective as well.  Food was great. One of the best meals we've ever had. I think as the menu changes daily, I don't think I'll go into detail, but nothing we ordered disappointed.  The experience from start to finish left us very happy and satisfied. 10/10 would recommend.",

Tried both alcoholic smoothie drinks and both were tasty!! Started with hamachi from raw bar menu with caviar and crispy rice and mustard seeds...amazing!!! This was a corrected order as demanded by Joshua since we told him we are big foodie eaters...and he was 100% spot on. We got the pork belly bao which is 100% must!!! This you seriously cannot miss or else you will be missing something in your life that you don't even know about!! Then had the pork belly ramen which was full of flavor...I was concerned from some \"plain tasting\" broth reviews but I personally thought it was perfect and full of flavor and I personally loved it!!

    "text": "Merp-pah.  We came here a few weeks ago with my husbands client. We wanted Ramen. And we didn't know that they only serve it for lunch.  When we saw the dinner menu, we were like, \"what the fuck?\" For dinner, it's family style and expensive as shit.   I've been to so many places on the strip that are from $10 a person to $200 a person. For 3 of us, we spent rougly $360, with tip. Do I think it was worth that price? No. How much was it worth? About $120...ish.   The food was good, but nothing spectacular. And honestly? This is your average joint on the strip. \"We're new and innovative!\" No, you're not. Cool decor doesn't make you good. But because you're on the strip, you can get away with this absurd prices. Was the quality good? Yes. But again, I wasn't insanely impressed with anything other than their selection of Japenese Whisky and their buns, hun.  The dishes we all shared (With my 1-5 star ratings):  Crab Deviled eggs *** Pork Belly **** Korean Braised Short Rib*** Crispy Potatoes ** - way too thick of cream that you may gag on. Chicken Karaage ** It's fried chicken. Can't do much more with it.  Pork Belly Bun ***** - best/cheapest thing there.   Oh, and the service was not good. The lady that filled our water 15 times, was nice and great. But we had to flag our waiter each time we needed anything.   Will I go back? For ramen, yes. Am I opposed to spending decent money on great food? No. But there are a pretty heafty handful of places on the strip that really deserve that status and price, in my opinion. And this place falls short for me.",

I'm very glad they don't waste the duck after cutting the breast, they take the lovely bones with meat on them and they cook it some more. Victor carved up the duck and the presentation was on point!

    "text": "DAT PORK BELLY DOEEEEEE~  If I were just writing a review about the pork belly, I'd definitely give it 10+ stars if that were possible, because that pork belly was THICCCC, juicy, and tasted like the food form of perfection. It makes me want to move to Vegas just so I can eat it every day.  With that said- the pork belly was my favorite part of the entire meal. My friends and I ordered a pork belly bun each. At first, we were skeptical because it costs $7 for one bun, but after ordering, we honestly wished we were ballin' enough to order 5 more- EACH. If you're asking yourself if it's worth paying $7 for just one bun.....trust me and just do it.   There are also two large slices of pork belly in the Shoyu Pork Ramen. The meat portions were really generous (2 huge slabs of pork belly + some extra pulled pork on the side) The noodles were pretty good (semi-curly ramen) and were chewy goodness! The poached egg was good, but I personally prefer my ramen eggs soft-boiled because I don't have to worry about them cracking into my soup. The ramen also comes with cooked bean sprouts, as well as scallions (or green onions??). If you're into sesame seeds, we were given some free of charge after asking! Personally, I prefer Tonkotsu (creamy pork) broth for my ramen, so I wasn't a huge fan of the Shoyu broth because it tasted similar to classic udon broth. Despite this, the broth was tasty and quite refreshing, especially after a late Saturday out in Vegas.   The only reason I docked one star from my review was due to the service. Our server was pretty attentive at first, but seemed to forget about us more and more throughout the meal. He began serving other tables and taking their orders waaaay before he took ours, even though we arrived well before those parties. When it was time to ask for our check, we struggled to flag him down and ended up asking a random server to grab it for us. No big deal to be honest, but just thought that because of it, I couldn't give Momofuku the full 5 stars.   Overall, a good experience! Hopefully they will come out with more types of ramens, specifically Tonkotsu! If the pork belly was that good, I'm sure the pork broth would be insanely amazing.",

The pork belly ramen was amazing, and I also had a shrimp bun. The shrimp bun essentially was like a shrimp patty inside a \"soft taco-shell\" like bun with a sauce and lettuce. Both were tasty and I only wish I had time to order more from their menu.  The place is definitely good for groups. It can get loud in there, but for this type of food and the quality and presentation, I'm a fan and would go back again and again.",

Then we had the ginger scallion noodles, which were perfectly al dente and tasted so fresh. For our mains, we got the black cod, which was a special, and the pork tomahawk. Both were excellent.

I tend to get bossy or Alpha when it comes to picking a restaurant to try LOL Yelp Elite Problems ha ha. I have no idea why but my sister wanted to eat here, my first reaction was, \"y tho?\" lol it has under 1000 reviews. From all the restaurants in Vegas. Anywho, she said she wanted to try it because of the Milk Bar next door and something about it being popular in New York?.   We came here on a Wednesday night and it was actually packed. The place definitely reminds me of a New York Japanese restaurant! The hostess said that the wait would be about 45 minutes. Luckily we found two seats at the bar which was \"first come, first served\".   I love me some pork belly buns so I got two of them and my sister ordered the shiitake and shrimp buns along with a beer. Everything we had was good. It's not bad priced at all, considering it's inside a nice hotel in LV. The bao buns are about $7 each, anywhere else you go it's probably going to cost $4-5ish. The bartender was really nice. Especially for a Las Vegas bartender. He didn't rush us to eat or get out even though there was a lot of people waiting to sit down.   Overall, a great restaurant/bar. Next time I come I'll be sure to make a reservation so that we can sit down in the dining room!",

    "text": "Exterior = 4/5 This is a Japanese restaurant located on the second floor of the Cosmopolitan. As we walked towards the restaurant, we noticed there was a line outside. I breathed a sigh of relief as we walked in straight to the hostess stand to claim our reservation spot. From the outside, there wasn't much place to wait, aside from standing near a bordering wall since to the left of the restaurant opening is Milk.   Interior = 5/5 Upon entering the restaurant, we passed through individuals munching away in the bar before entering the actual restaurant space. I liked the lighting in the restaurant which (I felt) was attributed to the large panel windows, which we were lucky enough to be seated by. I think this would be so relaxing on a rainy day (we just had cloudy, but I was okay with that).  Service = 5/5 Our server was bubbly, and she recommended some options that were not on the menu that we decided to order. She also would check on us a bunch of times.   Order = 4/5 Yuzu lemonade: 5/5 We are biased because we like anything yuzu and citrus-y. Boyfriend liked it because it wasn't too sweet or tart, or watered down. It was a nice balance to the alcoholic drink we got.  Dancing Daisy: 4/5 I was a little nervous when I read it had artichoke and chocolate - I was like whoa there. The server described it as an earthy tasting drink, and a popular one at that. When it came, I stared at the drink as it was topped with pepper. I was also trying to see if I could see the artichoke (don't know why). The drink smelled refreshing, and when you drank it there was a subtle aftertaste of chocolate.  Big Eye Tuna: 5/5 First time we had foie gras! We liked this appetizer and wished they gave more, but I can see how the foie gras can be too rich in higher amounts. The foie gras would literally melt as we are eating it, so I would use tuna to scoop it up. The asian pears brought a crunch to the plate, since everything else was soft.   Wagyu bao: 3/5 It was good, meat was soft. The flavors were nice. It only came with one bao - which for the price I was hoping for two. Overall it was okay.  Black Truffle Ramen: 3/5 The size was a nice if for one person. We shared but it worked out because we got other items. It was good, but I felt it was over hyped. You can taste the truffle. I liked the broth because it was light but I feel like the meat could be softer and more quantity.   Overall = 4/5 It was a nice atmosphere and place to eat. We enjoyed the appetizers a little more than the ramen we had, but that may just mean we have to come back and try another!  Hint = make reservations ahead of time to avoid the line! Also if the truffle ramen is available, the server said it is very limited in availability through the year (the last time it was offered was January 2017).",

Sarah helped our server & it was the best service I've ever had she was very knowledgeable about everything on the menu since it was our first time here!  It's family style & we had a group of people. We ordered the spicy cucumbers, roasted corn, hearts of Palm & avocado, & the A5 Kagoshima wagyu potatoes. The potatoes were to die for & well worth it!!! Family style we ordered both the salt & pepper lobster & shrimp, as well as the 5 spice rotisserie duck. WOW! Super delicious, it was packed full of a variation of flavors, tender & juicy.   I would definitely recommend this restaurant if you are in Vegas looking for a really good dining experience as a date night or with a group of friends!",

    "text": "I was pretty excited to try this place. I am torn between a 3 and 4. I wish I could do half stars. Overall, I would feel this restaurant is like a 3.5.  I made reservations on a Sunday night. I came a little early but they were able to seat us right away. I love the decor of this place. It definitively screams modern Asian fusion.  For food, we ordered the Bo Ssam, pork belly buns, chilled spicy noodles, and grilled asparagus. We all enjoyed the pork belly buns, the flavors were there and I love how it is thick slab of pork belly! My sister commented on how she loved the bun too. It was baked perfectly. We also enjoyed the chilled spicy noodles and grilled asparagus. Overall, great vegetarian options. The grilled asparagus had miso butter on it and it was divine! The main event was the Bo Ssam which consists of low-roasted pork shoulder accompanied by oysters, rice, bibb lettuce, kimchi, hoisin, ssam sauce, and ginger scallion sauce. Overall, we agreed that it is too salty. Too salty that we didn't want to add hoisin sauce to the meat. I was kind of bummed about it. I have to mark off 1 star from my review because I wish they didn't add that much salt. I love sodium as much as the next person but this was a little much.  Service was great though, very attentive and friendly. The server says that David Chang swings by every 3 months or so. Too bad we weren't able to run into him! :)",

It's tasty regardless, so enjoy and don't read too much into the Korean wraps that come with Vietnamese plum sauce, insipid Kim Chee and mutable Chinese scallion rice.   The crispy potatoes were the best potatoes I've had. The best. That's a bold declaration so you'd do well to order it too. The potatoes were all small in size meaning it's easier to cook them all to the same creamy consistency of excellently and uniformly cooked potatoes. Fried to perfection. Each potato pop into your mouth is an unfolding of the prized sixth flavor - umami. Yaasss!  Check in was... formal. Waiter Kawika was dope. Thanks for bringing aloha to this place!  Interior is definitely cooler than your typical Asian restaurant, so there's the balance of fusion. I'll take it.   Thumbs up!",

The vibe is very LA meets New York in Vegas including two awesome (and giant) graffiti pieces by David Choe on the long wall, which are just so cool.   Pork belly bao for $7 are a bit pricey, but you get what you pay for and that was pretty tasty. If you're not super hungry - I'd recommend saving your appetite for the fantastic ramen. The pork ramen (let's be honest, this is really what I came to eat) was $17. You can add some more goodies for differing amounts of money. I'm not really sure why the bok choy was more than the shitake, but perhaps a sourcing issue in the desert? Anyhow, holy moly - that ramen was to die for: noodles were the perfect chew in a complex and delicious broth.   All in all, the food was better than the Ssam Bar (another David Chiang restaurant we went to in New York). You can make a reservations up to 60 days in advance. If you're going to be in Vegas and want a taste of Momofuku, I would highly recommend giving this restaurant a try!",

The noodles were over cooked and so salty they were inedible. We had to tell the waitress and she immediately took it away and off the bill. I really disliked the flavor profile here. Maybe it was my mistake but I thought it was Asian fusion and I just did not like their take on fusion.   The sashimi had bacon fat incorporated and it was a gross flavor and mouth feel. The fish was a good fish but was ruined with a brown butter sauce. So yucky tasting.   Service: our waitress, Dale, was amazing. Very friendly and concerned if we were enjoying the food. Didn't have the heart to tell her that everything was a disappointment. The one star is for her.",

It came with lots of noodles, some shredded pork, not much broth and the only saving grace was the poached egg was good.

Laid back, great food, and a very chill ambiance with beautiful artwork from Dave Choe and a great view of the Strip. We were not as familiar with Korean cuisine, but our server and the manager did a wonderful job of walking us thru the house favorites. Also a very generous happy hour selection, and a rotating list of custom cocktails. Our favorites were the pork belly steamed buns and a blood orange/clarified butter cocktail they had available at the time. We were very impressed with the tofu ssam, which provided a nice, fresh contrast to the very luxurious chilled spicy noodles with Sichuan sausage and Thai basil.  Thanks to the staff at Momofuku for a wonderful birthday!",

We made a reservation through Yelp but arrived 30 min early. We couldn't get in early though there were open tables / seats available.  In any case, we got in after our reservation time. We ordered the pork belly buns, Jidori chicken bowl, Chickpea ramen and Shoyu pork ramen.  Everything was tasty and delicious.  The pork belly was a slightly chewy than I like, but if you know Asian-melt-in-your-mouth pork belly, you know it's hard to cook it to perfection.  Chickpea ramen is flavorful.  Shoyu ramen isn't the traditional pork slice - it's fatty and melts in your mouth too.  Setting is nice in cosmopolitan casino.  The only part I didn't like was the paid parking lot...  really?  In LV I have to pay for parking?  :0",

The tuna dish with foie gras was really plain- the grated foie gras was neat, but the tuna wasn't particularly fresh or delicious. The lamb ribs were tasty but a little overdone. The pork buns were nothing to write home about. And the crack pie (which was also something I was excited to try)  was so unremarkable I can barely remember how it tasted.   The service was great, and the cocktails were good. But this was a meal I'd be okay spending $75 on. We spent almost $200, and I wish we'd spent that at one of the better restaurants, like Jaleo (which is just upstairs, and much, much better).",

    "text": "I really wanted to like this placed, but both my friends and I are all quite disappointed. At first we all thought it was a Japanese fusion, new American cuisine, but it turns out to be more of a mixed Asian cuisines, like half Korean, half Chinese?   We have a party of 6 with 4 grown up men and 2 girls. We ordered 3 main course- the steamed brazino fish, rotisserie chicken and fried bone, and the braised Korean short ribs, a few buns, some 1/2 shell oysters and some chinese broccli as our green. The server suggested us to at least order 4, it is definitely an over kill. The portion was listed to serve 2, but each entree definitely can serve 4 . That are huge!!   1/2 shell oysters with melon ice - taste 5 stars, price and value 3 stars. Over all 4 stars. They are very fresh, and love the touch of the melon ice with citrus taste. It brings out the sweetness in the oyster but not over powering. I do enjoy it very much, except they are very small. For a price of $26 , which breaks down to $4.5 a pieces, it's very pricey.   The pork bun- it's okay 3 stars.  If I compare it to the Taiwanese style pork buns, the momofuku buns are not as juicey and lack of garnishing. If I compare to the vietnames/ Chinese style pork buns from bao hoag, they are lack of the crispness of the pork belly and flavors too. It is not bad, but nothing special about them.  The main dishes: My favourite is the Korean braised short ribs. It's so tender and loaded with flavors. I didn't think it was spicy from a glance, but they do put in the chilli pepper in, which live out to a Korean dish without all being red. Loved that they lined the claypot with rice cake and lotus root and potatoes. They soaked up all the flavors from the meat and the claypot kept it warm the whole time before we can finished the pot. Honestly, we could have just ordered this dish, have our greens and that would be plenty enough for us. The meat cubes / short ribs are huge . But it was braised all through out soft and moist. Love it. ( 5 stars)   The whole steam branzino fish- it was pretty good. But it seems like I was the only one enjoys it. We have half a fish not finished at the end of the meal. Although it says steamed, it's really not very steamed. It's more on the drier side and seems more baked. Which i dont mind. I like the lemon taste on it, because I am afraid of the fishy ocean taste. It's actually fairly well down considering cooking such a big fish to not let the meat went soggy, and maintain the fish taste with good dressing. Except it is not quite steamed, which my friend wished it was. Overall 4 stars.  The rotisserie chicken- I think it was an epic fail. The big pieces are very very dried. The fried bones are super salty. Nothing of us can eat a full piece to ourselves. We ended up sending it back to the kitchen. We have the whole chicken almost untouched.  In exchange we asked to try their ginger scallion noodle. It was a cold noodle with shiitake mushroom. It was another average dish, the flavors are good, but it was a bit on the oily side. Each of us could only do a small bite without feeling greasy.   Last but not least, their Chinese broccoli is very good. A typical Chinese style fried broccoli, not overcook, crunchy, and not over salty either.   Overall, I feel like people who gave good reviews are there for lunch instead of dinner. The Ambience is very nice, but the portions are very large and expensive. I much rather it be a smaller portion and shaved off the price a bit instead. They have lazy Susan on most table and intended it to be a family style sharing plates. I'd like to sample more dishes than to be over power by the portions they give.and I actually wanted more new American food then it being mostly Asian style allover then place.",

I'm totally in.   We ordered the pork belly buns and oysters Momofuku to share, and I also got the pork ramen.  Pork belly buns: This is arguably the best thing on the menu. I inhaled these buns... buttery melt in your mouth pork belly, along with sliced cucumber and hoison sauce in a soft warm bun. This is the only reason why I would return to Momofuku.   Oysters Momofuku: Grilled oysters with kimchi, spinach, and bacon on top. Meh. I'd pass on this next time.  Pork ramen: The broth was pretty lackluster. It wasn't robust and definitely my least favorite thing that night. It was a mediocore bowl of ramen with bean sprouts, slices of fish cake, poached egg, slab of pork belly and some shredded pork. Wouldn't order this again.   I think Momofuku's biggest appeal is the great location. They're in the trendy Cosmo and next to the Milk Bar. Would I eat here again? Probably not considering the plethora of awesome dining establishments in Vegas.",

I make a lot of pork belly personally, and this was a nice balance of meat to fat, with a very nice texture.  The Ham 2 ways was nice, in order to really appriciate it, you needed to have the ham/cornbread/mayo bite, or it was not as special. It was that combination of flavors and textures that elevated the simple ingredients to the next level.  The Five-spice Duck... was amazing! Presentation, flavor... it had it all. The sliced breast over confit sprinkled rice was unctuous and rich, with a great balance of sweet and savory. The deep fried bones will haunt my dreams. They have forever ruined chicken wings for me! Crispy fatty bites of heaven. Makes me want to do this with a Turkey after Thanksgiving dinner.   The restaurant gets a lot of hype, and in this case, I feel it is well deserved.",

Even though the kitchen was getting ready to close for the night and were cleaning, they were super friendly and took care of us very well. We ordered the spicy cucumber, two noodle dishes (no broth) and two buns (pork and shrimp). I had gotten the shrimp one in the past and although I hadn't liked it then, my friend liked it now. I guess it depends on your taste. The pork bun however was excellent and the noodles were delicious. The cucumber was not at all what we expected since there were chunks and not slices but it was fresh and definitely spicy. The appetizer was probably too large of a portion though and we struggled to finish it. We had such a pleasant time -even though they were closing they took perfect care of us and made us feel welcome at 1am. I would give 6 stars for service if I could!",

They're a couple dollars more than what the nicest Manhattan lounges charge. My drink cost the same as my entree. There were three of us ended up trying each other's drinks on accident because they were all served to the wrong people. Good thing we're not germaphobes!  The other thing that bothered me was the \"hidden\" ramen. When I asked the served about vegetarian items, she pointed out what I could eat on the menu. Right as we were about to order, my friend asked what was being served at the table next to us. The server said it was pork ramen that's not on the menu, and then she mentioned there was also a vegetarian chickpea ramen. Why not tell me that in the first place when I was asking about vegetarian options? I'm surprised we didn't need a secret password!   We adjusted our orders a bit since my friend and I got the two ramens. I'm glad I took the server's suggestion of adding shiitakes. The ramen was good, but it definitely needed the meatiness and umami from the mushrooms. My friends loved their pork ramen, chicken katsu and pork buns. The whole table had the spicy cucumbers which were very tasty and a surprise hit.  The setting is very nice. It's worth requesting a table by the windows to get a view of the Strip with dinner.",

We decided on the Pork Ramen and the Lamb Ribs.    The food was delicious.  The ramen had a soft poached egg which was different.  I preferred the regular soft boiled egg because once it popped, it just made the broth too eggy.  But the broth tasted smoky and good without the egg.  The pork belly was thick and tasty.  The lamb ribs went well with the perfect amount of yogurt sauce and the cilantro.  The flavors were balanced and it wasn't too spicy.  The ribs were a bit fatty but which made them moist.  I would order them again.    Finally, the bathroom was clean and modern.",

I'm not an easy grader ( hence no 5 stars), but I was pleasantly surprised and felt LV was as good as what I experienced in NYC.  We sampled a lot . Shisto Peppers ( Definte YES), Chilled Cucmbers ( Yes), all the Buns ( Yes, Yes,Yes).   The Wagyu Beef plate was outstanding but might not be your first choice given the price ( over $100).   The Chicken was not to missed and worth every penny.  We got many of the deserts. Crack Pie ( not worth it) , the Truffels ( get them all), and the soft serve ice cream ( not my thing).  All in all, worth the time, and price. Go.",

    "text": "It was alright...probably better than some of the ramen places I've been to here in Vegas. Got the Shoyu Pork Ramen. The chashu was definitely not as tender as I was expecting and I wished the egg was soft boiled rather than poached. The noodles were great though and had a good amount of springiness to them. The broth though... I can't put my finger on it but it had a very... charred taste to it? I usually eat more tonkotsu/pork broths that are more creamier and lighter colored vs the shoyu broth here. Very different than most of the ramens I've had before and definitely not worth $17.   Maybe I've been spoiled with excellent ramen in Southern California like Daikokuya so this place did not meet my expectations. Service and ambiance was excellent though!   On a side note, the Milk Bar next door was excellent. Pricey, but that seemed more worth it than the ramen. If strictly for Ramen, I'd suggest going somewhere else.",

We ordered the pork buns and the chicken karaage bun, and surprisingly we enjoyed the chicken much more. The texture of the bun was amazing, but the pork was cut very thin and doused in Hoisin sauce.  We also ordered the pork ramen and the chickpea ramen. Both broths were very rich in flavor, but very different from traditional ramen. I thought it was interesting, but prefer other places in the Vegas area for ramen. Next time I'd want to try the bo ssam when we have a larger group of people to share with!",

    "text": "Let me preface this with; I am a David Chang, Momofuku, Mind of a Chef, Lucky Peach, Ssam Sauce fan girl since 09.   Had I ever dined at a David Chang restaurant? No.  Had I made a recipe from his book? Nope, too lazy.  Had I followed his work and those closest to him through the years like he knew the location of the fountain of umami? Yes, absolutely.   Yes I'm a fan, however, I was so enamored with stuffing my face that it didn't matter what restaurant group I was supporting. It was about the food.   Party of 9, late seating, Saturday night. We ordered from every section on the menu including the large format dining. No one cares how many points I rate anything so I'll just throw some highlights around...  Shishito Peppers - pretty standard, still delicious.  Spicy Cucumbers - not obscenely spicy, try them. Soft Boiled Eggs - there was a slight miscommunication with our waiter that left us with five orders of these (4per order) I enjoyed trying them but it was like the Easter bunny was hopping around dropping eggs all over the table.  Pork meatballs - well balanced, super savory, great black eyed peas.   Romaine Salad - half of us were only given a spoon and chopsticks. Do NOT attempt to eat a romaine leaf with a spoon and chopsticks, you will look ridiculous.  Beet Salad - hell yes. Citrus and beets all day. All. Day.   Pork Belly Bun - exactly what I wanted them to be. Beautifully constructed and then devoured in moments.  Shrimp Bun - crispy little shrimp patty, spicy mayo, pickled red onion and boom..  iceberg? Works for me.  Shiitake bun - super thin shiitakes that were crispier than I anticipated with the fluffy bun and scallion. Loved.  Chicken Karaage Bun - the iceberg is back. And I'm still okay with it. Nothing wrong with the chicken bun but the shrimp gets the rose.   Oysters Momofuku - incredibly tender oysters with that slight hit of kimchi, all for it.  Citrus cured fluke - citrus + fluke.. you can't mess that up.   Black Winter Truffle Ramen - my only complaint is that I would rather eat this on a couch. Or a bean bag. Just Me, myself and my truffle ramen.   Smothered Katsu Chicken - This is THE dish I needed to order and wow. It was perfect. Like why don't we eat smothered Katsu chicken for thanksgiving instead of turkey? Throw some Hawaiian rolls my way and ask me what I'm thankful for this year.   Fried Chicken and Smoked Trout Roe - biggest let down of the night. I'm assuming the chicken was brined, in which case it was heavily brined. Edible but man, after a couple of bites it was election year salty. We never received the chive pancakes or the truffle creme fraiche so it was mostly pushed to the sidelines in favor of the other large format selections.   Bo Ssam - Bo. Ssam. Put it on a tshirt, I will buy it. Meat, rice, sauce, kimchi. I forgot about the oysters, they were too far away and when there is a pork shoulder within tongs reach, you ignore your surroundings. I tried the wrap in Bibb lettuce and eat method but one head of Bibb lettuce doesn't go too far for a large group. It doesn't matter either way. Eat the pork, love the pork, #BoSsam.   Best for last.. the Korean Braised Shortribs - Obviously at this point I'm full. I wasn't even going to eat a short rib but a sweet waitress served it to me and I couldn't refuse; Bless her. Any description I may attempt to muster up does not do this dish justice. Go with friends, try this and if you don't enjoy it, re-evaluate your life.   YUZU LEMONADE. Spend 8 dollars. Spend it. Savor it. Trust.   Milk bar - Blueberry & Corn Cookies, Chocolate Malt Truffles. Will definitely pass on those next time and go straight for the classic cereal milk soft serve. Simple, not too sweet, excellent.   Clearly I visited for the food but I have to mention the service and atmosphere. The dining room is beautiful and next time I hope our party is small enough to sit at the bar and watch the chefs at work. For being open such a short amount of time I thought the timing and execution of everything was wonderful. The foh staff were great, very friendly and attentive. There were a couple of hiccups throughout the night but one of the managers, Rica was quick to assist and keep us all happy.  There are a handful of items that I missed this round, but trust me when I say that I will be back. (Looking at you Duck)  Momofuku, welcome to Vegas. We need more restaurants like you. David Chang, you sir are great.",

    "text": "As of this review I've been here twice! The first time was with my friends for a birthday celebration and the second time with my family.  First experience: We made a reservation since we couldn't get a seat the first time! Luckily it wasn't crowded this time since it was on a weekday. We ordered a bunch of stuff including the pork belly and chicken kaarage buns, chicken noodle soup, pork ramen, spicy tofu squares, pork chops, and 2 cookies (corn and compost). I really liked the chicken noodle soup since the broth had a good amount of flavor and didn't taste salty. I got a good amount of noodles and chicken which got me full! The pork belly ramen broth was smokey and a little too salty for my taste. The buns are a must try if you ever go here! I normally don't like eating pork belly since it is fatty, but it was really good here. I'd stay away from the corn cookie. We ordered it since it seemed unique and interesting but it literally tasted like butter (I wonder how much butter is in one cookie haha). The other cookie was okay but definitely not worth the $3. We got some milkshakes from Milk bar next door so if you want a dessert after your meal just go there! I really liked our waitress since she was so nice and had a lot of recommendations. She didn't pressure us to order anything although we did get a bunch of stuff since we were in a celebratory mood haha.  Second experience: I made a reservation for my family and I at 8:30 p.m. and we weren't seated until 8:45 p.m. which wasn't too bad except for the fact that the front desk people were letting the other 8:30 parties ahead of me despite me checking in before they did. So when I asked how much longer it was going to take until we could go in, they proceeded to let me in. They either forgot about me or they just seat people who keep asking them when their table is ready. I ordered the ginger scallion noodle dish which was pretty good! It's a brothless vegetarian friendly dish with a bunch of flavor. The only sucky part is how oily it is towards the end since the oil sinks to the bottom of the bowl. The last few bites of the dish might not be worth eating unless you like your veggies saturated with the oil. The waiter was pretty friendly but I didn't like how he kept trying to make me order cocktails or wine when I just wanted water. One of my pet peeves is when the wait staff tries to get you to order more things when you clearly are not interested lol.  Overall I'd recommend checking this super popular place if you are in the area. If you are planning to visit during the weekend (including Friday) be sure to get a reservation. My first experience was really awesome and it made me want to come back and show my family how great this place is, but unfortunately my second experience was a bit underwhelming.   P.S. Now you have to order buns in pairs! You can't get them individually anymore which kinda sucks lol. Also, they have some of the dessert items from the Milk bar next door but they don't have the milkshakes. They do have cookies and the soft serve though!",

    "text": "Personally, I wasn't a fan of Momofuku. However, there were some stuff that tasted a lot better than the ramen that I got. I swear that Momofuku is supposed to be known for their ramen but it was SUPER disappointing. I thought the broth was SUPER salty and the worst part about it is that it was luke warm. How can you have ramen that is luke warm... I'll say the pork belly was actually not bad. Could be a bit more tender but i thought it was actually okay. Also, it's the most expensive ramen i've had too.. I know we're at vegas and all but $18 for it is just EXTREME. I would even have to consider paying $18 at ramen dojo(not that it is $18 but if it was) but for momofoku...damn that was damn expensive AND I wasn't full at all. Also, had a few bites of the kimchee pork bowl. Another dish you can probably skip out on. I thought it was a little better than my ramen honestly but the rice was mushy. I could probably use more kimchee too. It's more like a bad take on a bimbambap.  There are some things that they did do well though. The crispy potatoes were pretty good even at $12. It was HOT(like I would want my ramen to be HOT) and I like all the cheese and the crispness to it. What I thought was really wonderful was their dry roasted mussels. That was definitely on point delicious. A good amount of garlic, onions, and even bacon bits. It all went very well with the mussels and they give a generous amount. I thought it be pretty delicious to have that mussels with a bowl of rice and you mixed on those ingredients from the mussels with the rice and it be sooo good. Although, I thought the mussels were super unique and tasty, I just can't see myself coming back ever.   Service was okay. Didn't have to wait on a Saturday(almost 1 pm) so that's good.",

We shared the Tuna with shaved Foie Gras, Pork Belly and Shrimp Buns, Crispy Potatoes, and Black Truffle Ramen. The Tuna with shaved Foie Gras and Truffle Ramen may have won the best dishes of the trip even though there was some stiff competition. Service was great and it had a nice view of the strip. I'll for sure be back next time I'm in Vegas.",

The meat WILL melt in your mouth.   By the way, at night sometimes their menu won't have ramen. Just ask them for it. Their pork belly bao was also delicious and made great appetizers.   YOU. MUST. TRY. THEIR. RAMEN.  The meat will melt in your mouth and its extremely delicious. Noodles are good, and broth is slurp-able. Priced at roughly 20-25$ per bowl of ramen, it's just about right and definitely worth coming back again.",

    "text": "I am such a big fan of ramen and the brand that Chef David Chang has created. This place was on my bucket list. Being a big ramen connoisseur, that was what I wanted from here. It was a good thing that I had read previous reviews of this place or else I wouldn't have know to ask. Basically, ramen is not on the menu, you have to ask for it. So I ordered a tonkatsu ramen and a couple of buns shrimp and pork belly ones. These were all fantastic and if I had to die, then I'd be a satisfied person. So what you get here is not only quality food but you get a great atmosphere with great ambiance. The service was excellent and if you want first class place this is it. The price is what you would expect when a place is located in a big time hotel in Las Vegas so it wasn't shocking. End the end, is this a place I would recommend, yes. Is this a place that I would come to again, maybe as long as I have the funds. Definitely a good place to bring a date though you'd have to whisper in each other's ears or sit side by side. All in all I recommend this place if this is your first time getting ramen but they also do have an extensive menu that goes way past ramen.",

I thought they were both good, but I'm not sure if it was because I was dying of hangry or if it was just good. I didn't love the broth the ramen came in but the noodles had a nice bounce and had good flavor to them. The pork was sooooo tender. The best part of the ramen was that egg! Overall, the ramen was just good for me. I've had better to be quite honest.   I will say that they did have the best pork bao I've ever had. The bao itself was perfectly soft and it was just so bao perfect. Just how a bao should be. The pork in the bao was also tender (except same as the pork in the pork ramen).   Service could have been a little better due to miscommunication and they weren't really present even though it wasn't very busy.",

Didn't get our name but we stayed near her.  When 530 came, it was chaos, she let others who didn't check in with her sit first even the people in the line.  The manager knew I was upset, was nice enough to apologize and gave us some starters.   They need to fix Tye check in and how they call people in.  To the food, we really enjoyed all of it especially the yellowtail sashimi, smothered mushroom chicken Katsu and pommes.  Ramen is okay.  Dessert cake and we tried most of the desserts probably best to order at the milk bar- more selection and have the additional toppings which was not offered on the dessert menu.  The wait service made up for the errors in the front end of the restaurant.",

Feel free to get a seat at bar so you can watch the chefs prepare the food.   Service: was great! Our waiter was quite attentive and helped us our choices.   Food: we were given some oysters as a courtesy appetiser. This was my first time trying them warm, and they were really good! I had Pork belly ramen. Its a bowl of goodness! Ramen noodles were so thick and soft, I could've had 2 bowls. The broth, oh my, warm with a slight hint of sweetness. It was the perfect cure to a hangover. There was a poached egg dumped right in the middle, the yolk thickened the broth and took it to another level!  I also tried the pork belly bun $7! This one is a must!!  Drinks: I tried the penicillin and mai tai. The penicillin $18 has ginger in it. The mai tai was well done actually not too sweet.   Will come back to try some desserts! Overall great experience",

I'm not going to say this place was bad, it was just OK. And for that price, OK is just not really good enough to return. We tried the Hamachi to start and that was a serious disappointment. It was super expensive and we figured, \"for that much money, must be good\". WRONG.. it was really strange tasting, and not in a good way. Not a lot of flavor. Now the buns were a different story. I wish we had just ordered buns and nothing else. They were tasty, all of them. Pork belly was the best, but I liked them all. We also got the bucatini and the Sichuan lamb ribs. The bucatini was mediocre, and the lamb ribs were overly chewy. Pretty hard to eat. On the fence about the drinks. We tried both of the slushy drinks. The seven spice one had a real kick and the mojito was super strong, good for some, maybe not for others. My advice, if you're going here, just get the buns.. or walk over to the Wicked spoon and eat there.",

They also have some other buns that aren't officially on the menu, but you can ask your serve about. One of the ones we ordered was a caviar bun, which I thought was tasty, but probably not worth ~$30 for a small bun.   The noodles here were also quite good, the waiter recommended the shoyu pork ramen, and the broth was definitely one of the best parts about the ramen here.   Overall, I think this is on the pricier side for ramen, but quite tasty, so would recommend!",

The side order of tiny German potatoes coated on Old bay and cooked in duck confit had me thinking I'd need to double up my cholesterol medicine that evening. Potato perfection!

Waited ages for one of Chang's places to show up on the west coast and finally! We were seated right away at the bar both times (best place to sit). Boyfriend had beet salad and vegetarian ramen - both were tasty, and the crispy chickpeas in the ramen were fun! I had the pork ramen of course, and it was so good I almost cried. Literally had to stop and cover my face for a moment. Noodles were chewy, broth was rich, egg coated everything, lovely.  The line cooks kept passing us extra bits of things they were working on, all of them delicious - especially the braised pork omfg.  Came back two nights later to try the same ramen and make sure I hadn't just been overwhelmed with delight at finally getting to see Momofuku; it was just as good the second time. Yes, salty. It's supposed to be. I drank everything in the bowl.  Can't wait for the next conference that sends me back to Vegas.",

    "text": "First time at momofuku and last time for sure. Celebrated my mother's birthday brunch with my family. I have been to many restaurants in Las Vegas for brunch and dinner on and off the strip and was really excited to try this place out. Unfortunately the only thing on the menu I thought was good was the \"boa\", otherwise everything else was just \"ok\". If they plan on competing with all the other restaurants on the strip they have to improve your menu options and your portions. Our server (forgot his name) did his best but was also bussing his own tables. Despite that, we understood he had multiple large parties but still gave him a nice \"thank you\" note and a nice tip. However, after leaving the establishment we wanted to take a picture with the family and with our mom, who was celebrating her 77th Birthday. My sister nicely asked the hostesses if they could take our group photo. It was 230p, not busy but still the hostesses and one in particular looked irritated. She reluctantly took our picture without a smile and proceeded to still look irritated even after we asked to speak to the manager. Most places we have had brunch or dinner (Andiron, Hakkasan, Honey Salt, Stacked, Fix, Herringbone, Seersucker, Palm, Wolfgang puck, craftsteak, Yellowtail, Milos, Kumi, and Jaleo and more) always go out of their way to make your experience a good one. And taking a photo to capture your experience on social media is like the norm...... with that being said the front service (hostesses) at momofuku did not smile, did not ask how our lunch was and did not thank us for coming in. There are far better restaurants on the strip that have exceptional customer service and willing to go above and beyond to create a memorable experience. This place for sure not one of them.",

I had like ten glasses of water. The dishes are definitely catered to a western palette, but if you are Asian, specifically Korean, you will be highly disappointed by these dishes!! $25 for kimchee jjigae is such a ripoff and it wasn't even good kimchee. Also the bo ssam is not made the traditional Korean way. They told us to wrap it with oyster and the combo tasted terrible. Also the meat are not thick pork belly slices like I was expecting, instead it was braised, marinated pork -_- I am really disappointed and won't be coming back.",

An order of crispy potatoes had more salt than any human requires in a month and tasted so.  Foie gras, really?  I suppose I should have informed my friends, before dining here, about my vegetarian/reluctance-to-eat-force-fed-duck food choices.  Yes, you're right, everyone should be free to eat what they want.  As mentioned, sadly, the non-meat dishes tasted only of salt.  Not impressive.  I crave a restaurant that can cook with flavor and spice that doesn't achieve salt intake levels for the month.  My colleagues seemed happy with food and service.  I felt the staff was pushy and rushing us to order, eat, pay, and get out.  I didn't think it was because of behavior on our part, simply business.  (My colleagues and I were polite, imho, and spent large amounts on food and liquor.  Though, yes, I did request my potatoes be remade without salt ;-)",

The spoon was Asian ceramic flat bottomed kind which I don't care for because it makes me drool lol.  Had one large pork belly and lots of shredded pork.

The food we had was delicious, but the service was disappointing. Everybody was initially really friendly, however once our server learned that we wanted to try the noodles and buns, his mood dramatically changed and he wasn't as friendly as he wanted. The other staff members were still extremely friendly and our water glasses were never empty, but Alberto seemed to ignore us and was quite cold when taking our orders, taking our menus, and whispering to the other staff members to take our glasses away.   With that aside, the ramen was delicious, the cold noodle was delicious, and the scallion noodle was sooo good too. I just wish we weren't judged / seen differently based on what we chose to order and eat.  From watching Chang, it seemed he wanted to break boundaries and wanted for people to see and try all different foods, and being at momofuku tonight it just seemed like we were expected to get anything but just homey noodles and buns.",

The bao buns with roast duck were the only \"standard\" thing on the menu that didn't blow me away. It seemed roughly equivalent to similar dishes I'd had elsewhere.   The ramen, on the other hand, was truly exceptional. The \"bite\" to the noodles was perfect, and the broth had a flavor that seems like it must have been developed for days and days.   While I wish we'd had the $400 or so to have the Fried Chicken and Caviar experience, our reservation at Picasso was waiting, so we opted to stick with small-plates. If you're in Vegas, Momofuku is a must-visit. If you're staying at the Cosmopolitan (and I'd like to next time) I'd eat here several times.",

So here's a background of how my taste buds work- I like very flavorful and spicy food. If your Vietnamese, I would compare it to Tom Yum flavor noodles.  Ok so, I decided to give the ramen another try. I ordered the shrimp buns and also the pork ramen. The shrimp buns are so delicious! Perfectly juicy and seasoned well. The ramen broth was much better here then the one in NYC. It was more flavor on the pork. But if your looking for a spicy sour flavor then this is not your noodle.  The only thing I had was the price point for the buns- it is extremely expensive. $9 a bun. But overall the shrimp buns are my favorite and the pork ramen was also good.  I would go again for the buns but not the noodles.",

    "text": "Chef David Chang's Michelin Guide, Two Stars - Momofuku was our next stop in our whirlwind tour of the best restaurants in Las Vegas.   Momofuku - \"lucky peach\"  The staff was very friendly, helpful and prompt.  We sat at the bar/ prep area so we can see some of the kitchen and prep work.  They do have booths that look out into the strip that would be appealing during dinner.    The Shishito Peppers - smoked salt, lime  $9 were great and the wife and I plowed through them.  Worth the purchase.   The Oysters on a Half Shell - melon ice, lime, black pepper  $24  |  half dozen were not my wife's fav. She said they were very salty and watery and maybe just an off day for them.    The Pork Belly - hoisin, scallion, cucumber  $7 was tender and savory and enjoyed.  Also another must.   The Sichuan Lamb Ribs - smashed cucumber, chili yogurt  $32 tasted really good but were way to greasy for my liking and maybe an issue with the meat and not the preparation. Full disclosure: the restaurant took this off our check because we barely touched them. Again, tasty just too greasy for my liking.  Also serious kudos to the wait staff... they were very accommodating and offered us items off menu and on the dinner menu during lunch.  This was an item I really wanted to try and the staff made it happen for me even though it's on the dinner menu.   The Birthday Cake - confetti cake from \"Milk\" (next door but served in restaurant)was super super super dry.  One of the driest cakes I have ever eaten, period.  It was also still cold from the freezer/frig? Disappointing   We don't see the Michelin stars in our visit and giving this location an average 3 stars. I personal feel this is like Gordon Ramsay's burger restaurants vs his Steak House.  I think the farther the chef gets from his roots and as the locations get to be plentiful, the soul of the chef is lost in all the satellites.",

Not too crowded for lunch and somewhat reasonable for the Strip but I think at dinner it might be more expensive and more crowded.   Don't expect Momofuku Ko or even Momofuku Noodle Bar from New York, but hey, you don't have to go all the way to the East Coast for this so why not.  I thought the broth wasn't as flavorful and the options seemed much narrower for the buns (I remember the brisket bun was amazing in NY).  The ramen was tasty and the noodles were perfect.  Pork bun was on point, as expected but I didn't remember it being $7 for ONE pork bun before.  All-in it's a $20-30 type of meal with apps, drinks, lunch.  You can definitely get a cheaper lunch even on the Strip but I like Momofuku so I'd be back.  It has a small front on the second floor of the Cosmo, next to Milk Bar but it's a huge restaurant.    Takes reservations on Open Table.  Really hard to get through on the phone.",

Party of 4 had three bowls of ramen, spicy cucumbers, and shiitake mushroom bun and bill was $100 (after tip). Pricey but what do you expect in Vegas.   I personally had the pork ramen. Soft boiled egg was a little to soft for my taste but still good. Heavy but helped settle the alcohol.   Will definitely have to come back and try the family style Bo Ssam some day.   Yelp says they are open till 11 but they stay open to 130 with a limited late night menu. Apparently spicy chicken sandwich is only available late night.",

I know that everyone loves a good pork bun but - damn the karaage was good.  I'd have to say for me that trumped the pork bun.  We also had the pork ramen and tried the ginger scallion noodles.  Both were quite good and it was nice to have a ramen that wasn't overly salty.  I also ordered a Penicillin cocktail, which had ginger, honey and scotch.  It was quite likely the best crafted cocktail I had that visit to Vegas (Thanks Levi - she was our bartender/waitress).  To note - if you don't have reservations - getting seated may be grim.  We showed up 30 minutes before they opened to secure a spot at the limited full menu noodle bar seating (which also gives you a good view of the kitchen).  Bar seating is available too with a more limited menu.  For dessert - we had fruity cereal milk softserve with crunchies - so freaking good.  Reminded me of fruity pebbles.    Can't wait until the next trip out to Vegas for this.",

It was crispy and well seasoned. (5/5)  The pork chops were good but it wouldn't make me go back there. (4/5)  And it ends there... Everything else was unforgettable: soft boiled eggs, pork buns, yellowtail sashimi, big eye tuna with frozen shaved foie gras, and the chickpea ramen.   I guess I just expected more from this Chef. The main things I liked weren't even made by David Chang such as their soft and chewy buns (from a distributor) and the puree pomme is Joel Robuchon's.   Majority of my stars go to the server/wait staff. They were on top of refilling our water even when we were done eating. And our server was knowledgeable on how each dish was prepared (as they should be).  Oh and I can't forget about the ambiance! It's beautiful inside with plenty of seating. Their interior designer did a wonderful job. You even get a view of the strip. But with a beautiful place and lack luster food it's totally not worth it imo. I rather sit in a hole in the wall place and be served amazing food.",

I had a pork bun, chicken karaage bun, pork ramen, cereal milk ice cream, and compost cookie. All were delightful! The chicken karaage was probably my favorite, with the ramen being a close second. I can't wait to return to try more.  Service was great, loved the ambiance, lively but not too loud.   Sure, it's pricey, but this is The Strip. You're paying for more than just a good tasting bowl of ramen. Highly recommended!   Only negative to the evening was that parking is no longer free for locals, which is a Cosmopolitan thing, not a Momofuku thing. But something to keep in mind when heading here.",

Even though it's 100 F outside I wanted hot soup. Ordered the ramen, came out within a few minutes. Also ordered the spicy cucumber (definitely recommend that!) I was sitting at the noodle bar since it was just myself and the chef brought out complementary fingerling potatoes that were delicious as well. Ramen was great, mind blowing? Probably not, but a respectable ramen for sure. Broth had a rich flavor. Wasn't too overly salt and noodles were cooked perfectly in my opinion. I've seen others comment on the saltiness and noodles being over cooked.   Overall I'm glad I tried it. Would definitely recommend it if you're into ramen. If this was in my backyard I probably wouldn't make a habit of ordering $18 ramen, because I can get fanatics ramen for half the price, but this dinner was on the companies dime anyways",

The lobster and shrimp bowl was absolutely incredible. Even simple dishes like brussel sprouts and cauliflower were perfect!   Looking for a special drink? I loved the Toki Thyme. Refreshing with such a variety of food when the wine is also flowing. Hamachi is good, shishito peppers were a cravable appetizer.

My bf and I came for lunch, surprisingly it was a bit empty on a Sunday around noon. Love the decor and the space itself. I like the whole open kitchen concept as well. We started off with the pork belly bao and those were pretty good! I love the soft bao and the incredibly savory and soft pork belly. It literally melted in my mouth, the sauce they bring to the table, wasn't spicy and didn't do much for the bao. I would skip putting that on the bao. We got the spicy noodles with sausage, it was spicy but for some odd reason there were way too many cashews. Mixed together it somewhat reminds me of tantan mien due to the spice level, and I loved that! Only drawback was the overwhelming amount of cashews. The highlight of the meal was definitely the pork ramen! The broth was porky and flavorful, the pulled pork and egg were amazing and the noodles were good. Now this isn't Japan good, but it's good enough to satisfy a ramen craving.   Everything is a bit on the pricy side, but it is vegas! I would definitely come back here to try dinner and get the wagyu steak!   Total for 2: $65",

The table was still very spacious, and there was enough space for all of our dishes with drinks. The customer service we had here from our waiter was amazing. He was very knowledgeable, friendly, and inviting. I'd come back to Momofuku just for him. We ordered the chicken karaage buns, pork belly buns, pork ramen, and chilled spicy noodles. The buns were both great. The pork belly bun had a generous slab of pork belly and the flavor was overall fantastic. Well for $7 a bun (it's $14 for 2 pork belly buns), it better be a decently sized amount of pork. The chicken karaage was also fantastic. The chicken was very crispy and juicy while the iceberg was refreshing and crisp. It was overall, a solid choice. I wasn't disappointed in both of these buns, but I was a little sad to let go of my $7 per bun.  The chilled spicy noodles were a massive letdown. On paper, it sounds great. Spicy chilled noddles with Sichuan sausage, Thai basil, and candied cashews overall sounds like a pretty solid choice. In reality, I found myself picking out only the candied cashews and Sishuan sausage. The noodles were pretty spicy to a point that it was like they went for spice and not really flavor. I'm not down for something that just burns but doesn't have any redeeming flavor. I mean, I'm not one to waste food so I ate the noodles and took most of it home.   The ramen was pretty good, and the broth wasn't too salty or bland. It's a nice bowl of ramen but nothing amazing or novel.   I wonder if maybe I just didn't know what to order here. I mean, it wasn't bad but it definitely wasn't anything that really stuck out to me except for the buns. I feel like I really wanted to like this place and I had high expectations from Momofuku since I enjoyed other things from David Chang. Even so, I was slightly letdown. It's a bummer, really.",

I think I could eat twenty of these and not get tired, just fat.   I also ordered the chilled spicy noodles. The noodles come in a green thai basil sauce and on it sits a large chunk of sichuan sausage. The dish had plenty of flavor but it was a tad on the spicy side. I normally don't mind spicy but when it gets to the point where it gets too painful to eat you know it's a bit much.   I'd come back for the pork buns alone but would probably try another main entree next time.",

    "text": "I have never been to the original NY location, or any other location for that matter. This was my first time trying the food David Chang always posts about on Facebook. My friend and I came here between lunch and dinner hours. They close the main restaurant during this time, but the bar is still open, and they still offer a limited menu. Lucky for us, the limited menu had everything we wanted to try anyways.  We ordered the pork belly buns, pork belly ramen, and the szechuan rice cakes. I'll go from least favorite to favorite.  The szechuan rice cakes were good, don't get me wrong, but it's just a dish I'd be ok with skipping over next time. The rice cakes are CRISPY, which makes me happy. The topping is spicy, but not overwhelmingly so. The distribution of the topping was kind of poorly done-- the Chinese sausage ended up on the bottom, so we couldn't get a lot of it til the very end, and I think the dish could have benefited from a more even distribution of the salty sausage.  Then it is the pork belly ramen. David Chang loves ramen, and loved talking about ramen in Mind of a Chef. So maybe my expectations were extremely high. Here's the plot twist: the pork belly ramen is not a tonkotsu ramen. The broth on the ramen is a lot thinner and lighter, and the flavors are a lot more shoyu and bonito based. There's a lot of subtleness going on here. It is not the fatty super pork-y broth you'd expect from its name. However, it is still really good! The pork belly itself is so tender and flavorful, and the pork shoulder they put in the ramen is crazy good. The shoulder is so tender it kind of just shreds and falls apart.  Lastly, the pork belly buns. I saw there were a variety of buns, but this was the one I had to try. I loved it. The pork belly was smoky and so freaking tender. The hoisin based sauce gave it the umami flavor. And yes, I used the ssam sauce, and loved every bite.  We also tried the yuzu lemonade. It is quite pricey for what it is, but it was delicious, so you should go ahead and try it if you're splurging anyways.  I guess the biggest downside is the fact that it's pricey. Moreso than I expected. But the food is good, and I think I'd come back just to get those buns!",

    "text": "Refreshing take on Asian inspired cuisine.   Ordered the Bucatini and was met by a surprising dish. The black noodles caught me off guard, I may have just missed that on the menu but once you get past the color it is a great dish. The shellfish in this dish are cooked just right and the noodles were delicious. Big serving size for ramen so good luck trying to finish the whole dish. This was a great all around dish! As far as drinks go, I played it kind of boring and ordered their lime Vodka and Soda. Executed perfectly but then again they're hard to mess up, probably not worth mentioning on their drink menu.  The service was exceptional. Very friendly staff that made sure to answer any questions I may have had on the menu. I was sat at the bar in-front of the kitchen and it made for a great experience. I was there by myself so having these guys to watch provided great entertainment.   Overall, I would definitely recommend this place. Most items on the menu are fairly priced, however, some other dishes on the menu definitely stuck out being over the $100 mark. This place didn't quite blow me away which is why it only got 4 stars but I would definitely come back if in the area.",

Pork belly was very tender and the sauce in the bun - I think it's hoisin was a nice addition to the overall taste of bun  Soft boiled eggs - I'm not a huge fan of eggs but the taste of the salmon roe plus the crunchy pieces were interesting  Brussel sprouts - deep fried. I've never had them this way. Really enjoyed this side dish. Very crispy but also a little oily but very good  waygu filet mignon - tender delicious, best dish of the night   Spicy chilled noodles - I think they need to manage expectations on this dish. The noodles were extremely spicy - like I couldn't tolerate more than 2 bites and had to send it back. I'm used to spice and couldn't handle this dish. The pork patties laying on top make it hard to serve, I didn't understand if I didn't mix the dish properly so got hit all the spice.  Dessert- cereal milk soft serve is a must try. Get it with sprinkles and crumbles.  Service - Amazing! Our waiter Carlos was engaging and fun.   Wish they had the larger format items for smaller parties :( we were only 2 people so couldn't justify spending $218 on a main dish alone. Kinda wish they had a set menu where you paid 130 to 150 for a couple of courses, I probably would have done that instead of ordering a la carte.  Overall a good experience and will try the restaurant in New York for comparison.",

    "text": "Man, I really wanted to love this place. I read the reviews because my family had a craving for some good ramen, and I chose this place to go for some late-night dining based of this reviews.   We ordered four ramens, three of the regular pork belly ramens and a chickpea ramen (I believe these are the names). We also ordered a Korean rice cake small plate and a shrimp bun as appetizers.   We'll start with the Korean rice cake small plate. Now, my family and I are Korean, and we love us some tteokbokki (what it's called in Korean). From what we tasted, none of us thought the owner was Korean. The rice cakes were about half an inch in size and soggy, there were only about like five pieces in the entire plate of messy goodness, and the flavor just sucked. There was supposed to be some type of squid in it, but everything was just a gelatinous mess.   The shrimp bun was the best part of the dinner, and only one of us ordered it. It was seasoned well, and was a very good size for the price.   Now the ramen. Oh no, the ramen! I've had Japanese ramen at over fifteen locations, if not more, including in Japan. The broth is supposed to be rich from hours of boiling pork bones. The broth for our pork belly ramen honestly tasted like they just heated up water and added a pinch of salt. It was so weak that I thought I was just consuming a watered down cup of noodles. Speaking of the noodles, the noodles in our ramen varied from completely raw to undercooked. The only good thing about the ramen was the pork belly, which is the only part that was cooked correctly and seasoned perfectly. The chickpea ramen my dad had was super salty. I guess all the flavoring went into that one, which I highly doubt because the chickpea ramen is vegan.   For the money they charge, I honestly expected at least mediocre, but I didn't even get that. The only reason I'm giving two stars is because of the pork belly and the shrimp bun, but the main parts of the meal were seriously lacking. Maybe we just went on a really, really bad cook day, because there are so many good reviews that I don't understand. If you guys want good ramen, there are definitely other places you can go that are off strip in Vegas, or it's even worth making the drive to San Diego for truly authentic, good Japanese ramen.",

Having been to New York Momofuku and Milk Bar we already had a plan on mind: buns, ramen, spicy noodles, wagyu.  Tiffani completely changed our approach to dinner: spicy cucumber, pork meatballs, beef tartar, chicken Karaage, salt & pepper lobster.  They just ran out of the seabass that we really wanted and we decided to save her favorite chicken Katsu for next time when we were tasting less.  That sounds basic, right?  You know it's serious when someone from Hawaii recommends the Katsu.  You can tell that the people that work there love the food.  The first 3 stars are for the food and environment, our whole night was made by the very enthusiastic and fellow food-lover, Tiffani.  The S&P lobster was reaaaally good if not very oily.  Share in a group of friends, not for two like we did.   The buns are super reliable of you like bao.  I'll save the review of each dish because you probably have your own tastes anyway.    Instead of that, I'm going to show you photos of what we got.  Enjoy!",

We were there for a 1 year engagement (super slow to get married,but she is difficult)  and Mags + crew took care of us like a pro. We went to Momofuku in New York and had a horrible experience and because of the LV crew we have reservations for Majordomo in LA. Great job again Momofuku I'm drunk and happy!   Update again,  We had to go back a second night in a row for the Bossam. It did not disappoint. We tried the cucumber flask on its debut night and it was excellent and you get to keep the flask! Michael the sommelier was pro again as well as Levian our server. I don't know how you could not rate this place 5+ stars every time.

Spicy Cucumber - Cucumber were crunchy with a perfect balance of saltiness and spiciness.  This may sound simple but simple truly works for this dish. 2. Uni Hashbrown - a 4inch by 4inch of hashbrown topped with fresh uni.  Is it worth $42?  Not so sure. 3. Pork Belly Bun - melt in your mouth pork belly and a slice of pickled cucumber to cut the richness of the pork belly, sandwiched between a bun.  4. Fried Chicken and Caviar - We actually only wanted the fried chicken but the server said we cannot order the chicken by itself, so we opted for the smoked trout roe.  We honestly though the entire chicken will be fried but no...seems like only the wings and drumstick was fried, the rest of the chicken was not fried...reminds me of Albertsons chicken.  What elevate this dish is the creme fraiche with truffle.  Could care less about the pancakes.  5. Crack pie with cereal milk soft serve - Chef Christina Tosi's crack pie is like no other.  Cereal milk soft serve is also something to rave about.  I have been there a few other times and always opted for the ramen, since that's one of the item that Chef David Chang is known for.   Will I come back?  Absolutely to try other items.",

Ordered: Pork belly bun - great, must try eat with side sauce, it changes the flavor of the pork belly, really get more then one! -1 Star, Grilled lamb ribs - this is where one of the Star is lost, taste like dry fried lamb ribs and the lamb was super gamely even with the yogurt, expect better then this from David Chang. (Yes I know he isn't cooking but staff training is part of being a great chef) -1 Star, Shoyu pork ramen x2 - amazing runny egg, the pork belly is the same pork belly as the bun, pork shoulder was yummy, the noodle I love, -star for the soup, it was flavorful but super salty, yes Shoyu mean soy sauce I understand but I had other Shoyu ramen that u can taste the soybean but not salty!",

    "text": "SO I have a like-dislike relationship with David Chang. Sometimes he seems like a real douche when he talks about his elitist opinions and even his attitude towards other professions he seems to think aren't worthy of his time. AND sometimes he seems like a really great guy who speaks up for his team and his chefs and is willing to admit when he's wrong and will try to change. He's clearly engendered a lot of loyalty so he's doing something right.  Also, his mom is super cute.  Anyway, this isn't a review on D.Chang but a review on Momofuku LV. Which is, strangely, similar to how I feel about him as a person.  Sort of liked some dishes, disliked some others, but didn't feel passionate about any of them. We showed up for our 7:00 reservation on time and still had to wait 15 minutes to get seated. I HATE when this happens, by the way. BECAUSE the risk of me losing a table when I'm 15 minutes late is possible. But it seems totally okay for restaurants to do this and force me to wait. Whatever. There goes a star.  Tried some ramen. Because thought David Chang and his \"ramyun\" (just cuz he's Korean, he thinks it's not pretentious at all to call it by its Korean name, I guess) were famous. I hated it. Broth was wayyy starchy. Noodles were slimy. Meat was fine. But good ramen isn't made only with good meat. Sorry. Ramyun.  Had the pork buns which were pretty good. Good bao, good meat. And the long beans were well-received by the table.  Then paid through the nose for 6 ounces of wagyu. It was too salty and a little too overdone.   Also, I like wagyu. I think it's delicious. BUT I can get 8 ounces of wagyu from Mastro's for like, $150, or 6 ounces from Momofuku for almost twice that. WHO'S THE IDIOT HERE? Obviously me.   Cocktails were fine. Good enough, at least.",

Tri-tip was succulent and tender, which I expected from a Wagyu cut but it was flavorful. Mixed up both as a lettuce wrap with the rice and with the rice by itself.   Wife ordered the pork belly bun and Brussels sprouts. Pork belly bun was enjoyed and the Brussels sprouts went well also with my Teri-tip. For desert, ordered the crack pie a la mode. Crack was sweet tasting like pecans without the actual pecans. A la mode was the perfect combination.  You do have to pay $1 for filtered water. Service was excellent and always kept our water glasses filled.  Highly recommend and will return!",

My husband, being a carnivore through and through, somehow ended up with the vegetarian option, and he was pleasantly surprised, the lack of fatty pork was compensated with chick peas that were crunchy?  Idk if that even makes sense but trust me, If you gave it a try you would understand exactly what I'm trying to convey.  I'm partial to char siu pork, the fatty tender pork adds a \"je ne sais quoi\" to anything that it's added to, and this ramen was no exception.  The server was funny, and kept us entertained. I have to say everyone we've encountered in Vegas restaurants have all been pretty amazing. I would imagine they would all be \"over it\" dealing with tourists day in and day out but they've all been great!",

So upon staying in the hotel where Momofuku is we decided to try out the Social Hour which is from 3:30-6:00pm.   We started with the Shishito Peppers( Smoked salt, lime) which were delicious and had great flavor not to spicy. Then we also had the Spicy Cucumbers( Togarashi, toasted almonds) it was a different way to flavor cucumbers and the boyfriend does not like them at all these had such good flavor he ate almost all of them. Then I had the Pork Belly Bun( Hoisin, scallion, cucumber) This is one of my favorite items on the menu so much flavor in one small bun the pork is rich and creamy and the sauce is the perfect amount to cut the fat on the pork.   For my main meal I had the Pork Ramen(Pork belly & shoulder, slow poached egg), I am a big fan of Ramen, they definitely have some of the best I have had. The boyfriend had the Spicy Fried Chicken(Smoked pepper sauce, cured cucumber), he really enjoyed it and advised me it's way to spicy for my taste but it was excellent.",

This is the kinda place you can walk into when starving and walk out full without much hassle.    I tried the Pork Belly Buns and the Chilled Spicy Noodles, and both were great.  The Pork Belly Buns are delicious and bursting with flavor, though messy as hell - prepare to turn your napkin into a crime scene.  The Chilled Spicy Noodles were equally excellent.

Honestly, I come to Vegas so much I can say I'm a part-time local and I had no idea they put a Momofuku in the cosmo! But maybe that's because I always go to secret pizza across the way??   Haha--anyway, came with a big group of 9 and had to wait a little as we didn't have a reservation. But gaaahhhdaayum it was worth the wait. Amazing food that won't rob your pockets.   What did I get?  Mussels -- so good, clean, fresh, simple and a lot of them. Great bang for your buck!  Tempura lobster and steak -- soooooo good, lots and lots of seafood and definitely a \"shareable\" entree  Cold noodles-- with green onion and I believe mushroom. One of the more simple dishes, but probably my favorite out of everything  Ramen --I'm a huge ramen snob, and it lived up to it's name! (which btw, *good* ramen in Vegas is a game changer bc before this place, I would only get hangover soup at the Pho Kim Long)  and of course....Christina Tosi's 'Crack Pie.' Yea, it's exactly what it's name entails.   I. WILL. BE. BACK.  I've been to the sister bakery Milk in NYC, here and in DC. -- trust me you need it.",

Vegetarian options are limited, though when I asked our server, she told us that the special for the evening was a black truffle ramen with freshly shaved black or white truffles, and an egg yolk - sold!  As a starter we got the smoked pumpkin appetizer, and the pork belly bun (2 per order), since every table around us seemed to be getting it too!  The food was all fantastic, but the ramen was to die for.  So rich and flavorful, and the noodles were perfectly al dente.  They were pretty generous with the truffle too (see pic!).  It was $50 for the bowl, which was intended for one person, but we split it into two.  And honestly, it was worth every penny.  Service was excellent; our server and the other servers were all very attentive, clearing dishes, refilling our water glasses (even though they leave the bottle on the table, they still pour it for you), and periodically checking on us.  Can't recommend this place highly enough!",

We genuinely feel the restaurant is now getting better and better (and more memorable) with each visit. Our server (I apologize for forgetting her name) was super knowledgeable of the menu and went out of her way to make the nice extra special, including complimentary sake and a desert cookie from Milk Bar! We started with some delicious cocktails (good enough I don't remember the names :), Shrimp Buns, and then had Chickpea Ramen and Roasted Rice Cakes (although I preferred the slightly different variation of this last summer, this curry-centric one is still very delicious, especially with the recommended additional shrimp). Everything was SO fantastic! Needless to say, we'll be making a reservation for our 5th Momofuku visit when we're back in Vegas at the end of August!",

At first i was surprised with the price range and what should i order. My friends and I went to go ahead and try the Fried chicken and Caviar. It was almost $400 and we also ordered the ramen and the brussel sprouts.   I think the hype for this place is just a little to much. I think its a once a year experience for me. If i was suggested to go back...? Maybe. I would probably try somewhere else. The food was okay, but it did blow my mind. The service was excellent, the way they served us explaining everything on what to order was on point. You have to try this place for you tourist !",

I would say it's average delicious but I can still name a few places off the top of my head with even better ramen (and for cheaper). The bowl is enough to fill me up though, I couldn't really finish it after drinking a Fat Tuesday prior to coming the last I went. I do wish they had different meat options as not everyone is into the fatty meat that the pork belly has.   |[ g o o d ]| Service is nice and attentive and the restaurant is decorated really fancy. It's a great place to treat yourself because if you're in Vegas you're probably celebrating anyways. I definitely enjoyed eating here both times I've been. Save this place for special occasions or when you're just feeling baller rich and wanna reflect that with the dining choice just to feel baller. The sides are good as well. The food quality are all decent and good here. 4/5. Man, that bank account does hurt a bit though, but YOLO. xD",

I liked how hey had pork shoulder in the ramen. It was really tender. I wish there was more than one piece of pork belly in the ramen.   We also ordered the spicy cucumbers which came with roasted nuts and this green puree. It was really good and refreshing. I like ordering cucumber appetizers at restaurants because of the clean crisp taste and it isn't heavy so it never ruins the main course.   We also order the pork belly bao, which personally was whatever. I was expecting a thicker cut of pork belly but instead it was two thinly sliced pieces of meat. It was a little disappointing.   Overall the meal was good, but I probably won't be back. If you haven't tried this place I would definitely check it out.   They also have a milk bar outside with cookies and other desserts. I'll definitely go to that again.",

We forgot to ask about it until we were done, but on the menu it says it comes with a slow poached egg, so we felt ripped off. :(  pork buns- I prefer the pork belly in the ramen, but these were pretty good as well.  spicy chilled noodles- this was my favorite dish of the meal, actually.  It just really hit the spot with the right amount of spice and nuttiness with the basil flavor.  Would order this again for sure.  Overall, I enjoyed the meal.  I've been to the Momofuku NY for dinner, and this time it was a casual lunch, so the experience was different, but you can tell the chef pays attention to details on every dish.  I actually ordered the Momofuku/David Chang cook book after our meal because I'd love to try and make the pork belly baos at home.  I'd come back here, but I would make sure there is an egg in my ramen next time before I start eating!",

I was a bit surprised about how relaxed the restaurant was. I had always expected to walk into a fine dining environment and I'd be the most frumpy person in the room. We made a reservation which I believe is a good idea although it didn't seem like much of a wait if you didn't have one. This had to have been one of the most flavorful ramens I've had thus far. If you are as obsessed with eggs as the rest of us then you should know that the yolk just adds a completely new adventure to the soup. I've been told time and time again that absolutely must get the pork belly buns as well. I was not disappointed as they melted in my mouth. A perfect pork belly is hard to come across. They were not stingy with the servings which was very relieving since I was nervous about spending triple that I would usually pay for a bowl of ramen. I'll never be able to come to Vegas again and NOT come here!",

    "text": "I was excited to try another one of David Chang's restaurants, this time on the west side of the country!  Located in the modern Cosmopolitan hotel, the restaurant is classy, spacious, and trendy.  The four of us went for the 5 spice rotisserie duck meal, one of the large format dining options.  I was surprised we didn't have to pre-order the duck since Momofuku Ssam bar in NY requires it.    The waiter brought out the whole rotisserie duck on a wood serving table and carved the different pieces in front of us. First, the breast, then the leg confit, then placed them over a bed of ginger scallion sauce rice.  They took the rest of the duck to the kitchen to deep fry it for us!  There were accompanying sauces and wraps brought out for the duck.  The chinese style accompaniments included chive pancakes, hoisin, ginger scallion sauce.  The korean style accompaniments included kimchi, bibb lettuce, and ssam sauce.  The meal is a fun experience, but the standouts were the leg confit over rice, the chinese style accompaniments, and the deep fried duck pieces.  I'm not a fan of duck breast, but the leg confit over rice was heavenly. Though I'm a Korean who loves kimchi and ssam sauce, I really think the Chinese way of hoisin + duck cannot be beat!!    We also ordered pork belly buns and spicy cucumbers to start.  The duck meal is for 2-3, but it was beyond filling for the 4 of us.  The large format meals are pricey, but it was a good one-time adventure for us!",

    "text": "One of the most trendy places to eat at in Las Vegas right now, so expectations were very high. Japanese fusion, and that would normally make me not want to go. That fact that it is inside the Cosmopolitan is probably the best reason I went. What is the nicest thing I can say about the Cosmopolitan? ---- The fact that they have never told me or any guest I have ever recommended visit there \"No\". They bend over backwards to please.  Advanced reservations are required. Unless, like all of Las Vegas, you have friends in Low, High, and in between places. Friday and Saturday nights the place is always fully booked.   The wife and I grabbed two seats at the bar while waiting for a group of friends to meander to the Cosmo-Aria connection. The bartender took excellent car of us and a quick snack rapidly turned into a full meal.  We chose a Daiginjo Dake that was awesome and was recommended by the bartender. Momofuku oysters as appetizer, pork ramen, dry roasted mussels and summer truffle ramen as main course.   Did chef David Chang kick off the ramen boom in Las Vegas? Don't know because I brought my craving for it with me from long, long ago. Momofuku is made of glass, wood, steel and concrete, grabbing a corner of Cosmo's second floor. The deserts come from the Milk Bar next door. Didn't try one, but they looked spectacular.   Momofuku's vast range makes it special in Las Vegas. The Strip might have everything you can think of now, but it doesn't have many restaurants where you can find a perfect $20 bowl of noodles for lunch and come back at night to share edgy large-format presentations like the vaunted fried chicken and caviar. I had the same reaction you are having now when I first heard about Fried Chicken and Waffles in Hollywood California. Why not Fried Chicken and Caviar?  Read somewhere that Chang was excited to play in Las Vegas. Hopefully he's enjoying himself so far. We sure did, and first chance we get we will go back and try the Fried Chicken and Caviar.",

The ginger rice was too sweet. Lobster and shrimp was too salty, I wanted to tell them to take it back, but at $45 I felt bad... I did tell them to take back the Brussels  sprouts which was again was too salty... service was great though!",

Even tho he not there personally, the Chefs to the bartenders to servers expressed and showed who Chef David is, how he see and expresses food. To the Bigeye tuna which I recommend to his crackpie alamode, just how fun and creative he can be and serious but passion he is about his life. If you have a chance go and explore his world thorough his restaurant Momofuku.",

And I love ramen! So disappointed. The food is not \"clean.\"  The shishito peppers have crap dust sprinkled all over them. The cucumber salad is doused in pureed crap and dusted with more crap.  The mussels were cooked alright but just not the delicious style of cleanly-steamed Belgian mussels with white wine sauce. Instead they were roasted and dry and covered with crap dust.  The truffle ramen is a complete waste of money - tastes like Campbell's cream of mushroom soup but for 45 bucks. Dear chef: stop it. Just stop it.",

The shishito peppers we ordered were soooo unevenly salted, that some pieces were extremely salty and we had to rinse it in water. The Brussel sprouts and cauliflower were delicious at first bite but then unbearably salty by the second bite.  So if you come here, I would recommend sticking with the buns and the noodles. Everything else I've had has given me a salt headache.  And of course, maybe just skip it all together and just get a cereal milk soft serve at their milk bar next door.",

The Salt and Pepper Lobster and Shrimp was the crispiest yet lightest Tempura I've ever had.  A great portion size including peppers and scallions all covered with a very Unami oyster sauce. The Basil sauced Chilled Noodles with Asian Sausage was amazing balanced with peanuts and peppers. The food here was top notch and a great take on the ingredients. The overall atmosphere was typical Vegas in a hotel mall area so noisy and rushed. A great spot for food and especially family style eating. A bit on the pricier side although the quality is better than most.",

We asked if they had a tasting menu, and Manny (who was awesome) told us to give him our price point and the types of food we liked. Then, the chef created a custom dining adventure just for us. It was AMAZING!! Steamed buns = yum, but this was only the beginning. Corn = great, but still just getting started. Melon/seafood salad = beautiful, fresh with a little kick every now and then, loved it. Bucatini = I didn't even know what this was before I ate here, but it was perfection. The egg was poached perfectly, and the hollow noodles give the pasta just the right texture. Next came the lamb ribs... OMG...O.M.G!! Fall off the bone tender, so much flavor, yogurt sauce... I've never had better lamb. Finally, Manny brought out the porkchop. It was almost too beautiful to eat, and it tasted even better than it looked (and I don't usually like porkchops). Juicy and salty with hints of sweet. I never wanted it to end. If you are looking for a place to experience food in Las Vegas, you've found it. I can't wait to experience a whole new Momofuku adventure on our next visit!!",

My next visit to a Momofuku-family restaurant, I will most definitely splurge. I'm confident it will be worth it!  I ordered the grilled asparagus with miso butter, which was the first dish to come out. I was absolutely blown away. The miso butter had the slightest heat to it, and the asparagus took on a smoky flavor from the grill.  My next dish was the killer: Pork Belly Buns. Never in my life have I enjoyed fatty meat until this day. The fat melted in my mouth, and the leaner parts of the cut were flavorful and tender. I could barely finish one, but did eat the meat out of the second bun. The buns themselves were neither too sweet nor too savory, a perfect complement to the pork inside.  I was seated at the counter overlooking the kitchen, a seat I would highly recommend taking. It is clear how much care goes into the dishes, having seen them as they are prepared. As a nice bonus, one of the chefs gave me a sample of the roasted corn with raclette sauce appetizer! I haven't been able to stop thinking about it. It was so much better than I ever thought roasted corn could be!!  Thanks for the wonderful dining experience, Momofuku LV. I'll definitely be visiting the DC location back at home.",

When I called the restaurant, the hostess told me the only option was rescheduling and offered no appologies or remorse.  Only after writing a negative review did management reach out and offer a seat at the bar for the same night.  I appreciate management trying to make it right, but at the level of dining momofuku aims to hit, this sort of amateurish service from the staff is unacceptable.  Making someones wife cry really isnt acceptable at any level.  We aren't taking management up on the putzy bar seat offer since there are so many better dining options in Vegas, and will be instead eating elsewhere.",

    "text": "A few things to note before reading this review: 1) I hardly ever leave restaurants reviews because I typically don't care enough to spend the time or energy 2) I am obsessed with food 3) I am extremely picky and have numerous food allergies/restrictions (mostly raw vegan, gluten free, severe lactose intolerance)  Momofoku's food and dining experience is 112% the best I've had in the last year. As a huge fan of David Chang and his food philosophy, I had high expectations--Momofoku exceeded them.   As I mentioned above, I'm vegan with many food allergies. Although the menu isn't necessarily known for being gluten free or vegan, the kitchen was extremely accommodating and even created 2 specialty dishes, one of which is without a shadow of a doubt the best thing I've eaten in a VERY long time.   As someone who's worked as a server, I rarely approach a dining experience with a critical eye when it comes to service, but Momofoku's hospitality is impossible NOT to mention. From the hostess stand to the multiple servers who took care of us throughout the night, I truly felt right at home--a difficult feat in a place as over-the-top and trashy as Vegas.  One server in particular, Mags, was incredible. As I mentioned, I try not to be too critical when I eat out (because I know from experience how challenging it is to be a waiter,) but I also know amazing service when I see it. Mags is definitely top 5 waiters I've ever had the pleasure of dining with.   Thank you all for an incredible experience. You truly made our trip very special and one we'll never forget!",

By the way, if you are a kitchen freak as I am, GET A KITCHEN VIEW. If you're just a tourist, get a strip view.  As soon as we sat down, I was in awe of all the action I was witnessing. It was so beautiful to watch everyone working together in sync! Everyone in there was hustling their butts off. And it was really cool to watch as we waited for our food.   Anyway, about the food !!!  I was with my husband this night. We ordered 3 things.  Unfortunately, there weren't much Vegetarian or Vegan options. So our waiter helped with some suggestions and even offered something that was off menu...  1. The Chickpea Ramen w/ Bok Choy & Fermented Shiitake Mushrooms (off menu.) I give this one a 2/5. The chickpeas were on the dry side. I wanted to love this, but overall it tasted bland and seemed to lack some flavor and spice.   2. Shishito Peppers. I give these guys a 5/5! They were cooked or fried perfectly! The seasonings were on point and it was just irresistible!  3. Roasted Potatoes. 4/5. They were great! The potatoes were cooked well but the toppings on top were a bit overpowering and seemed to \"hide\" the main ingredient, the potato. If I plated this myself, I'd have put the cream as a base, then potatoes, then Parmesan (imo.)   All in all, I'd go back for sure!  I just wish they had more Vegetarian and Vegan options.",

The service was excellent, but the food somewhat lacking. We ordered the pork belly appetizer,at the suggestion of the waitstaff, which was delicious. But that is where the goodness stopped! The apple salad, meh! Sweet potatoes decent. We also ordered the whole fried chicken. It basically tasted like a grease ridden salt lick. I have never encountered so much salt in my entire life not even in the Dead Sea! It was basically inedible, we wrapped it and took it with us and gave it to a homeless person on the street. I still feel uneasy about the decision to give the food to the homeless man as it might've sent him into a hypertensive crisis!",

    "text": "I tried the Vegas Momofuku back in May for the first time, but after my most recent vacay trip in September, looks like it'll be a definite go-to whenever we're in town. In the nature of this wildly unpredictable city, our dinner experience was much more of an adventure than we'd ever expected - on account of both the delicious food and fantastic service! If you get the opportunity to sit at the chef's counter, I'd highly recommend it. We were lucky enough to have Josh as our bartender/server and you really cannot go wrong handing him the reins. From the drink offerings to food recommendations, everything was completely on point.   The Food: Hamachi v. Bigeye Tuna - The bigeye tuna was my favorite dish from the first Momofuku visit. Shaved foie gras?? Ugh, my heart. Well this time around, Josh also recommended the hamachi appetizer. We were feeling particularly indecisive so we decided to get both to compare. Admittedly, the hamachi was amazing and the two dishes were unique in their own right. No regrets from getting both.  Heirloom Tomatoes - A really fresh in-between dish as we waited for our main. I might not get it again, but it was fun to try such a different twist to some of the ingredients I grew up with.  A5 Hokkaido Wagyu - THIS. First, I need to clarify that this isn't the normal tableside wagyu dish we originally saw on the menu. We were making bets (in Vegas, surprise) on what the MP for the wagyu was and Josh mentioned to us that there was a wagyu special that had been on the menu a couple of days ago. Luckily they gave us the option to order it and we figured this could be worth the splurge. And it really was! The wagyu was prepared with uni shoyu - a melt-in-your-mouth amazing, perfect medium rare. Still dreaming about it months later.  We were able to try a couple of desserts from MilkBar, which is connected to the restaurant. Josh brought us several cookies to try and we shared the soft serve with rainbow sprinkles. It was a simple and sweet end to a fantastic dinner experience. I won't keep rambling, but for tldr; we had quite an adventure, can't wait to be back!",

Our awesome server Manny had great recommendations, he suggested this appetizer that was like poke with strawberries, I ordered it to try it out because, the paring sounds interesting. I was not disappointed, and found a new favorite. We also had the short ribs and the milk bar birthday cake! Thank you again to the staff for making our night there the highlighted our trip. I can't thank you enough. You made my husband's birthday extra special. We will be back again.",

So we did and it turned out great. We didn't have to make any decisions or try to figure out how many orders of each plate to order for our party size etc.  We had the oysters, burrata and pear salad, shishito peppers, bigeye tUna, spicy cucumbers, pork ramen, grilled asparagus , grilled lamb, and whole 5 spiced duck. Every was fresh and delicious!  Would come again!",

    "text": "TLDR: Doesn't live up to the hype.  Try it if you've never been to Momofuku restaurant. Temper your expectations, $14 for 4oz pour of sake.   With David Chang being a household name amongst foodies the hype around Momofuku may just be too much for the restaurant to uphold.   I was extremely hyped to try Momofuku in Vegas and this was my first experience at a David Chang restaurant.   We had a late lunch at 2:30pm and ordered the pork buns and the pork ramen. Figured these are what they are known for so decided to go with the known good items.   I was prepared to be blown away or at the very least get an understanding of the hype of Momofuku.   The pork buns were close. Not mind blowing but very very good. I expected the pork to be steamed like a bossam since I've seen pics of it but it wasn't. I suppose that's only available in some of his other restaurants.   The ramen while good didn't blow me away either nor sadly did it live up to the hype. The texture of the noodle were great but the broth didn't quite do it for me.   I was really excited and hoping to love Momofuku and embrace the hype but sadly, no.   If you're a Momofuku fan and never tried it, it's worth a try. Just remember to temper your expectations.   Oh and I'd avoid ordering sake. Not sure what I was thinking but I ordered sake and it was $14 for a 4oz pour.  Cheaper options available but keep that in mind when ordering sake.",

    "text": "I've had Momofuku in Washington DC so wanted to try the Vegas one too since I've only had the pork buns. The pork buns are still just as good but I feel like they were more expensive than DC. We sat in the back nicer restaurant area so that might be why. They don't have ramen on the menu for dinner but it's on the \"secret menu\". Basically yes you can still order it. They had pork and chickpea ramen. The pork ramen was awesome and I heard the chickpea ramen tasted pretty good too.  The ramen noodles aren't the thin type which I prefer the thicker ones.  Broth wasn't too salty or heavy and it's definitely more of an artisan ramen vs. your package ramen. Overall great tastes, just expensive pricing.",

    "text": "This review was actually for December 2016, update below.  I had been reminded to write my review because we kept passing the restaurant:  After all of the hype, we were super excited to try Momofuku.  Unfortunately, nothing was that exciting or better than other places that made the same thing.    Surprisingly, the ramen was disappointing.    Asked a couple of other friends who came separately.  One thought it was good, but could understand our feelingnothing was amazing.  The other agreed that she was underwhelmed.    With all of the great reviews, we have debated on trying it again, but because of the many places in Vegas, haven't been willing to chance the time...  Update:  We just stayed at the Cosmo again, and my wife wanted to try Momofuku because she hadn't tried it before.  We decided to get a quick bite before heading to the airport.  I wasn't too excited, but had to let the boss try it.    Upon looking at the lunch menu, I asked our waiter which of 3 noodle dishes did he recommend.  He told me that I hadn't actually selected his favorite dish, the chickpea ramen.  I gave him a look of disbelief.  Come on dude, a vegetarian ramen???  He promised that it had passed the test for many patrons.  I put my faith in our waiter thinking, here we go again.  My wife ordered the pork belly bun, and we also ordered the spicy cucumbers.  The pork belly bun was a lot better than I remembered it before.  It was very nicely crispy, which we weren't expecting.  The cucumbers were very good as well.  I am into cucumbers right now because I think they remind me of the crunch on kettle chips.  The ramen... well, it was damn good, even though it was a vegetarian ramen.  I cheated and added chicken.  It was very tasty and the noodles were very chewy (nothing like the thin Tokyo noodles).  My wife commented on how good it was too.    Our waiter also gave us a complimentary glass of sake that was very smooth, enough so that my wife said she would drink it.    The only negative comment would be that my wife saw a person in the kitchen drop a towel, pick it up and then put it on the stainless steel working area.  That then got us to thinking how come the guys don't need to wear those hair nets on their beards that look silly, haha.  Anyway, my wife got a little grossed out, but the food didn't disappoint!  P.S. note water isn't free...",

Wanted to try their fried chicken & caviar but it was going to take 45min, not an ideal wait time if you're hungry, so we opted for oysters & mussels as the appetizers and the whole steamed branzino, with asparagus and crunchy potatoes as sides.  Oysters were superb, fresh! However, the sauce they gave with the oysters seemed too salty & almost unnecessary, so we asked for tobasco and you know that did the job!  Mussels were amazing, my new fave! Never had mussels prepared with dry garlic, paprika, peppery seasonings but it was delicious!  The whole steamed branzino was cooked to perfection! The meat melted in my mouth but the flavor of the fish was just alright. Seemed to be drowned in some sort of a butter, vinaigrette sauce & pesto stuffed in the middle of the fish. Interesting preparation, but I wish it had more of an asian kick to it.  As far as the sides go it was a little more on the saltier side.   Will be back to give the ramen a try!",

After we have seated, our server asked us if its our first time and she recommended us to order their spicy chicken sandwich, and we ordered spicy chicken sandwich, shoyu pork ramen, porkbelly bun, and a shishito pepper as an appetier.   Didnt wait that long, we got our shisito pepper as an appetizer, got porkbelly bun. It was fresh and pretty good. Then ramen came out, was okay but really salty. When they brought sandwich, we stopped for a moment cuz it came with whole bunch of shisito pepper as a side. If our server let us know that it comes with pepper then we wouldnt order plate of shishito pepper. After done eating (we didnt even touched second plate of shisito pepper, seriously it was way toooooo much of peppers for Two people.) When we got the check they wondered if i want the togo box so i asked my server why didnt she tell us it comes with pepper so we could order something else. OmG.... that attitude, Whatever she said was horrible and terrible. Haha. She said \"its first time serving it today\" WHAT??????  I didnt even expect her to apologize but THAT WAS WHAT YOU TOLD US TO ORDER. food was okay, atmosphere nice and really liked about open kitchen. But most important thing \"service\" was worst.

I sat at the bar with one of my girlfriends and the bartender (sorry I forgot his name) was waaaay too funny.

    "text": "UDPATE: A manager did reach out and was apologetic about our experience which I always appreciate when that time is taken. Therefore I've added an extra star for their customer service. I'll have to still stand by my review of the food since the update is just about the outreach, but it is a good sign they want to make things right.  ------  Was excited to come here and have some good ramen. Friends ate at be New York one and raved. Overall would describe as \"meh\"   Food: pork ramen was bland unfortunately. They do give a good amount of pork and noodles which was nice but ended up dousing my ramen in the sauce supposed to be for the pork bun because it needed flavor.  The pork bun on the other hand was pretty good but for seven dollars not super worth it.  The chilled ginger noodles also underwhelming.  Price: 17 for the ramen, not worth it. 15 for the noodles and it wasn't as much food.   Service: just ok. Was seated quickly which was nice and never had to ask for water refill but had to wait long time to get two other dishes we ordered with the meal to arrive at the end for us to take to go. Shouldn't have had to wait an extra 20 minutes for food we ordered at the beginning.   Sadly no desire to go back. I know when you open multiple locations quality tends to go down so I wouldn't be surprised if that was the case here.",

    "text": "I've only heard good things about this place, and was bummed when I was not able to try it when I went to visit New York.  Luckily for me, they opened a location in Las Vegas and my friend made us reservations this past weekend.   Momofuku is located on the 2nd floor of the East Tower at the Cosmopolitan (around the corner from Marquee and Egg Slut). Got there at 5:30 and it was a little unorganized. There were groups of people scattered infront of the host table and I wasn't sure if there was an actual line. I was able to get to the front after asking several people if they were waiting to check in. From there it was smooth sailing.  We got seated right away and the staff was really friendly. My friend who made reservations put down it was for a birthday and the staff greeted me happy birthday (it really was my birthday weekend). They were really nice.   Unfortunately for me and a couple of my friends we ate only a couple of hours before coming here so we were still stuffed. We ended up sharing a couple of of the baos (chicken karaage and pork). Both were really good, I actually liked the chicken more though. I ended up ordering the pork ramen. That was really good, and despite being full, I forced myself to finish it because I knew I'd regret it. I did regret not trying the smothered chicken katsu. Per my friend \"it's really good.\" Luckily for us we were also able to try the chive pancake, and that was delish. It's really basic but it was really good.   For dessert, we all ordered a soft serve (all come from Milk Bar next door). I ordered a cereal milk and crack pie swirl with crunch. That was really delicious. It was not overly sweet or anything and the serving was perfect. It was so cute!! I tried my friend's fruity pebble soft serve, and I'm not even a huge fruity pebble fan but that was amazing. I would definitely order that next time! And surprisingly, they brought out a few birthday cake truffles with a candle on it for my birthday. It was really unexpected and sweet of them. I know they probably do it for everyone on their birthday but I thought it was really nice. The birthday truffles were heaven and even better when you mix it with your soft serve.   Depending what you order this place can be pricey but you're in Vegas! Splurge a little and definitely try out Momofuku. If not, at least hit up Milk Bar next door!",

Pork ramen was very good. The bit of pork shoulder had great flavor. Add ons for the ramen do get spendy though. The fiance was pleased with the chickpea ramen as her vegan choice.

Has a nice view of the strip, especially from the Private/large group dining area.  A lot of the previous reviews mentioned problems with service. If my experience was any indication, it looks like those have been addressed. We had very solid service all the way from the Hostess to the wait staff and bartender. Service was friendly, fast and courteous.  On the menu for us this evening  Pork Belly Bun, and Chicken Karaage Bun - Both of these are exactly as amazing as you think they are. If I ate nothing else here, these would do.  Beet Salad with Citrus, rye XO sauce - This has the potential to be very very good. Tonight it was just alright. Desperately needed some nice large flake salt.  Ginger Scallion Noodles with pickled shiitake, cucumber, and wakame - This is a really simple and really good dish. I am not sure anything that would make anyone lose their mind but there is nothing you will ever say bad about it either! Satisfying is a great word!  Rotisserie Chicken & Fried Bones - The chicken was quite delicious! They use Jidori which is my absolute favorite. Super flavorful! The bones were a bit of a miss for me, just didn't work as well as I had hoped.  Back to staff, special kudos to the bartender. He stopped by to grab a couple of our plates and noticed my drink was low. Asked if I needed another and suggested an off menu option he had been playing with. It was great and well appreciated.  Couple of minor misses - plates could have been refreshed better between courses and there was a miss with getting utensils back to us at one point.   Keep working! I think everything is falling in place!!",

I expected more from the ramen just because I know Momofuku has a ramen/noodle restaurant in New York.   Hamachi sashimi- The Hamachi tasted fresh and combined with the sauce it was a pretty good dish.   Pork belly bun- comes with hoisin, scallion, cucumber. The pork belly was tender and had good flavor to it. 1 order only comes with 1.   Shrimp bun- comes with spicy mayo, pickled red onion, iceberg. I actually liked this one more than the pork belly.

After entering the restaurant, the extremely beautiful decor will catch your eye. With amazing decor comes equally amazing food. Their donuts were delightful and the wagyu carpaccio just melts in your mouth! I wish I was able to try one of each plate or have enough money to get more sushi from the menu, but my hot stones bowl will do for now.   The waiters were extremely attentive. Me and my friends has a running joke going on that they were like hawks waiting to grab peoples plates the minute they finished eating their food!   It's a pretty pricey place, but I would highly recommend!",

Almond adds a good bite  Pork belly bun (4/5) - still solid execution with a good cut  Ssam Pork Bowl (5/5) - this is so addictive! I was impressed how it can taste light, filling, and flavorful at the same time for a rice dish.  Wakame Noodles (5/5) - very light and relatively healthy option. Add a poached egg!  Tuna with Foie Gras (3/5) - the tuna gets overpowered by the foie gras which does taste light for such a heavy dish but it does get heavy and one night after a few bites. This could be great for a large group to share but for 2 people, it's a lot to eat.  Truffle ramen (2/5) - Disappointing. Pricey as truffle is but this was very much the sum of its parts and not elevated  Would come back. They seem to really do well with their simpler dishes that feature less expensive ingredients. The more expensive ones could be to your taste but I haven't had as much luck with them.",

Total disappointment and a feeling of deceived, especially at a reputable place like this.  We ended up getting their buns with different filling in them. They were just ok.  The bun was just mouthful of flour with 2/3 of it being the bun while 1/3 stuffing... The veggie one was terrible. I only found the pork belly one edible.  Everything felt very pretentious here.  I am not here if I'd visit another Momofoku restaurant again.  Definitely would not recommend this particular one in Las Vegas.",

    "text": "For a variety of reasons, I've been a fan of David Chang for quite a while now.  Not the least of which, quite simply...his restaurants/eateries are just good.  Granted, this is based entirely on the two spots of his in NY that I've been to (Ssam Bar and Milkbar), but there wasn't much about either experience I didn't like.  So, clearly, after seeing that one of my favorite restaurateurs had taken up shop in one of my favorite hotels in Vegas, it was only a question as to WHEN I'd stop in to check them out!  While I've yet to visit most of their sister locations, I imagine that this Momofuku outpost is on the trendier side.  Which makes sense, give their home (Cosmopolitan).  The front \"bar\" area has a more of a casual look, but the main dining room in the back is nicer, with large windows to take advantage of its perch overlooking The Strip.  More importantly, the (lunch) menu, though not extensive, looked just as good - starters, buns, noodles, sides...just about everything looked delicious!  **Note: besides how the menu is different for lunch/dinner/afternoon/late night, the range of offerings changes often/daily, so it's very likely that what I had won't be on the menu when you come here.  -- GINGER SCALLION NOODLES with Pickled Shiitake, Cucumber, and Wakame...$15 Unmixed: (<a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/momofuku-las-vegas-las-vegas?select=B23zSjMubR0dOOuugfA6_Q\">yelp.com/biz_photos/momo...</a>) Mixed: (<a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/momofuku-las-vegas-las-vegas?select=DmJ32I9OmJzN2xzI7FO21w\">yelp.com/biz_photos/momo...</a>) It may not have sounded very interesting, but this was great!  The fact it was served cold was unexpected, but it made sense given the flavors - slightly salty, earthy, and acidic.  The cucumbers added a nice crispness and the noodles had just the right bite to them!  Delicious!  -- CRISPY POTATOES with Truffle Tofu and Parmesan...$12 (<a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/momofuku-las-vegas-las-vegas?select=2rDrbHuSoZiNy0lHLGRAgg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/momo...</a>) I was actually pretty hopeful for this one, but it missed the mark.  While I liked the truffle flavor and the Parmesan (who wouldn't?), the potatoes didn't do it for me - kind of bland on their own and not the least bit crispy.  -- PORK BELLY BUNS with Hoisin Sauce, Scallion, Cucumber...$7 (<a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/momofuku-las-vegas-las-vegas?select=oVqsueDTysos7YQDoB6P6w\">yelp.com/biz_photos/momo...</a>) Though not quite as good as the one at Ssam Bar, this was still pretty solid.  It was a little dry as a whole, as there wasn't much sauce and part of the pork was dry (surprising, since it's pork belly), but everything else was good - the pork wasn't super fatty, the bun was decently soft, and the overall taste was good.  -- SHOYU PORK RAMEN with Pork Belly & Shoulder and Slow Poached Egg...$17 (<a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/momofuku-las-vegas-las-vegas?select=kNfm7ssIl0zAmaVjZdrlaQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/momo...</a>) I wanted this as soon as I read it on the menu, but I got even more stoked when I saw this come out!  The pork belly (so thick!), the pork shoulder, the egg, the noodles, the broth (so rich!)...everything was perfect.  Even the sprouts were good!  I would totally come back just for this.  Beyond the food, I'd be remiss not to mention the service here - from the hostess to the variety of servers that stopped by our table, everyone here was super friendly and accommodating.  At the end of the day though, it's all about the food and Momofuku was straight up delicious.  As bummed as I was to miss out on their noodle spot when I was in NY, I was just as elated to have corrected that here...and that it was so good!  Given how their dinner menu offers an entirely different slate of things to try (including a lot of large/family-style dishes), I'll undoubtedly come back to try that.  But even if it's just for lunch, afternoon snack, or late night eats, or even for just a ramen craving though, you can bet I'd come back just for that shoyu pork ramen!",

The pork belly buns leave you in this tension of wanting to scarf it in one bite and wanting to eat it slow to savor. So conflicted. Comes with two, worth every bit.

    "text": "Having \"free time\" jumped at the chance to try this little gem!   The action and comfort from the restaurant as I made my way to the bar to sit was so inviting. Even before ordering here the collective of employees are like family and it transfers immediately and fills others around them with glee.   After pulling out the stool at the bar and placing my handbag in one of those lovely hook for excess clutter it was time to view the menu. The cocktails and wine offering are some of the best here at the Cosmopolitan. I decided to dabble with beer from abroad today; since my selection of food was on the spicy and saucy side!  I enjoyed the service of three different bartenders; whom were all an extension of the next. They were attentive to all the customers at the bar. Very outgoing and friendly. Their radiance was shining light that spread out in vibes of positivity. So some of the best and happiest bartenders in Vegas! Have to respect those that absolutely love what they do?  My beer selection took me all the way to Singapore where I decided to embrace the tiger and had a Lager Tiger. It was really smooth; plus the bartender recommended it too me. It was an excellent choice with stunning taste. You might compare it to Budweiser in America but smoother.  Beer selected check! Wanting to explore something saucy I decided on Shishito Peppers and the Grilled Asparagus. These two plates come separately and make a wonderful pairing together. They are extremely healthy and delicious. The Asparagus was amazing and properly streamed too.  Let's move to talk more in depth about the Shishito Peppers. Perfection on a plate; but let's explore more! So being the kind of girl that invites hot stuff to dinner these peppers make a perfect pairing. The Shishito pepper is of the Asian cuisine and they are flavored well when roasted all by there lonesome. They are spicy but not like American peppers. The hints of smoke are more apparent in the taste and a sweeter flavor. It is worth trying if you enjoy the heat of good peppers. I ended up enjoying all the peppers and asparagus paired with a tiger to rinse it all down!  The restaurant and bar of Momofuku are so delightful and worth a peak! Try the peppers and beer from somewhere new. I did and will explore other regions of the globe when I return.",

I had the pork ramen, which was overly salty but not the worst ramen I've ever had. The noodles were cooked well, the portion size was small, but they give you a lot of meat. Wish the pork belly was sliced into two thinner pieces, the large chunk they give you is hard to eat. The broth doesn't quite have that deep rich flavor you'd expect from good ramen.  My mom got the ginger scallion noodles and I tried some, I will have to agree it wasn't great. There were too many competing flavors and it was very overseasoned and over salted.  The service was great though, never had my water glass less than 1/3 full, which is a big accomplishment given how thirsty we were from all the sodium.",

    "text": "Momofuku Las Vegas. One step for David Chang. One giant disappointment for mankind.   I have been a fan of David Chang's television series for years as I find him as interesting as articulate yet I have not had a chance to try his cuisine up until my last visit to Sin City. Momofuku was founded in 2004 with the opening of Momofuku Noodle Bar in New York City and has since become an empire thanks to Chang's ascent  into culinary superstardom. The Vegas outpost is similar to the rest of the Momofuku locations with neon, glass, white oak, raw oiled steel, and concrete as the focal points but the Las Vegas Strip's dominating skyline reminds you exactly where you are at all times.   I arrived in a group of four at 8:00 pm with reservations and was seated immediately  and took in the interior over a craft IPA and noticed at once that the service was near Michelin star level. Our waitress knew everything about each dish and was happy to answer any question as in-depth as our party cared to go. There is no questioning Momofuku's service game.   The menu is split up into Appetizers, Small Plates, Large Plates, and Noodles & Buns which encourages your party to share in order to sample as many flavors as possible; this is the only way to go if you aren't going to opt in for the family style meals that start at $200.00 (yes, ouch).  If you are going to only get one thing at Momofuku (and that might not be such a bad idea) let it be the Pork Belly Bun. This is perhaps the best Bao I have ever had sporting a generous, thick slice of perfectly charred Pork Belly with a smear of Hoisin along with Scallion & Cucumber as garnish. Thanks to the texture of the Bao Bun, everything comes together in perfect harmony bit for bit and there is a nice salty note in the close only made possible by Pork infused with Hoisin. At $7.00 each, this is the most inexpensive gourmet experience you will have in Vegas without In N Out or Shake Shack being mentioned.   Sadly, this is about where things start to slide downhill quickly.   Next to arrive at the table was the A5 Kagoshima Wagyu Potatoes and as incredible as the presentation really was, the use of the A5 Wagyu is a dismal failure. You see, they pound or slice the meat razor thin and then melt it over the Potatoes - so much so you cannot decern any Waygu flavor whatsoever. In fact, we actually called the waitress over and insisted the Beef was forgotten altogether until she pointed out that the thin, almost transparent cheesecloth looking top was, in fact, our A5. This dish is $42.00 worth of Potatoes with Honey Mustard, crunchy Garlic, and Almonds. Absurd.   We also shared the dubious Spicy Cucumbers tossed with Togarashi & toasted Almonds which did not excite in any capacity along with the equally insipid Hozon Rice Cakes (another lackluster $28.00 Tapas). After those four courses, we decided we were simply burning money and wasting valuable stomach real estate on a dud in Vegas and that my friend is heresy.   I cannot express the level of depression I had as I left... David Chang was a long time hero of mine but some things are better left for televisionfantasies.   Momofuku is a hard pass. Well, beside that Pork Bun, that is.",

    "text": "We got the star treatment on a Friday night, the day after seeing Lady Gaga in concert.  The hostess led us to a round table of five, in a corner overlooking the Eiffel Tower and the Dancing Fountains of the Bellagio.  A round table that our waiter found scary because it juts out past the building - seeming to have no foundation (but there is a view of the Momofuku's manager's office on the floor below).  The waiter said \"I'm a fan of scary movies, but this table scares me more!\"  The sensation of floating over Vegas with a dancing fountain view was totally spectacular.  The lazy Susan made sharing way, as the waiter demonstrated with a scratchy DJ move.   When one of us mentioned a nut allergy, the waiter said, \"No worries.  I know mouth-to-mouth.\"  Nothing wrong with a flirty waiter, even if he did promise to throw a peanut into a dish . . . His favorite dishes are the branzino, duck and lamb.  We started with a group of small plates and worked our way to share two large plates - cod and branzino.  Shishito peppers with smoked salt and lime.  Mostly mild with the smoked salt providing a perfect counterpoint to the acidic lime.    Sweet and sour long beans with ginger, garlic and black vinegar.  Excellent, crunchy bite with complimentary sauce.  Spicy cucumber with togarashi and toasted almond.  The togarashi is a sweet roasting spice mix.  The cucumbers tasted fresh, green and herbal with the spice mix providing layers of nuttiness that did not overwhelm.  Smoked pumpkin with carrot barbecue, orange and cilantro.  The pumpkin had a crunchy outer shell with a soft, perfectly cooked mushy center - a great balance of texture and taste in each bite.  Ginger scallion noodles with pickled shiitake, spicy cucumber and wakami (a brown seaweed).  A favorite of the group and the only dish we ordered two of.  The mushrooms offered a good acidic counterpoint to the noodles.  Miso black cod with crab butter, mushroom and roasted vegetable broth.  One of us is married to a fisherman and explained that cod, with its rich, buttery flavor once once not well regarded in restaurants.  Once regarded as a trash fish, something g that was caught while searching for more popular fish, but this dish was a favorite of the fishmonger's wife.  Fun fact from the fishmonger's wife \"Black cod was popularized by Nobu and is also called sablefish or butterfish.\"  Whole branzino with bonji, bonji ponzu and crispy rice.   Bonji is like a soy sauce, but it does not contain soybeans, rather it is made from fermented hearty grains.  Ponzu is a citrus based sauce common in Japanese cuisine.  The branzino was delicate and perfectly accompanied by the crispy sticky rice, hidden underneath.",

    "text": "We liked it so much we came here twice.   Full disclosure: I'm extremely biased. Momofuku brings me back to my NYC days, one of my first tastes of fine dining and definitely my first taste of good ramen.  It was the Momofuku ramen back then, and it's the Shoyu Pork Ramen here. Shoyu broth is never my favorite, but this broth is rich and savory, and that thick, dissolving chunk of pork belly and shredded pork shoulder will never get old. You can't go to Momofuku without ordering a Pork Belly Bun. That brick of pork belly is everything. There's a Spicy Fried Chicken Sandwich on the late night menu. Crispy with a sweet, sweet burn. Lunch includes Ssam, and the Jidori Chicken is surprisingly good. The chicken is perfect, so tender and juicy, great if you're craving something on the lighter side. Be sure to share - it's still a lot of food.   I still love Momofuku. Everything on the menu is good, and they deliver quality every time. If only they would bring back that kimchee stew...my life would be complete!",

The drink selection was vast with many unique options. The Violet Femme and the Penicillin were awesome. Staff were very attentive and knew exactly what we needed. Some of our favorite dishes were: Chick Pea Ramen (Sounds crazy, but it is outstanding), Heirloom Tomatoes (Fresh Plumes, Thai Basil, Sesame oil), brussels sprouts (yummy Japanese twist that will explode in your mouth). Lastly the Creamed corn stole the show. Famers market purchased, cooked corn husks, with a added pesto and topped with crispy chicken skin and truffle oil! We even added some to our ramen to make for the perfect ramen. They also have a truffle ramen which I would try next time. To end our experience, we enjoyed a milk chocolate explosion. I'm actually not impressed with anything at Milk except for the what was once \"crack pie\".  Anyway, check out Momofuku! I assure a great dinning experience!!!",

On our first visit, we celebrated my boyfriend's birthday with 3 friends. Since it was a special occasion, we decided to get the family style bo ssam pork shoulder. The price tag for the item alone was hefty, but well worth the money. The menu says that it feeds 3-4 people, but we had plenty leftover, and brought it home with us. All the drinks and side dishes we ordered were delicious, including a few of the special items for the evening.   This past Saturday, we came in for lunch at 11am before our flight back home. My family and I all ordered individually, but took bites of each other's dish - how could we not! To start, we had the pork belly buns and spicy cucumbers, and half order of oysters. An order of the shishito peppers came out, compliments of the chef, as it took a while to get our cocktails and a few of the items from the menu were unavailable at the time. For entrees, we had the 5 spice duck ssam, bo ssam rice plate,  and the ginger scallion noodles with chicken, which was one of my favorites.  If you're not too full after the meal, order some of the famous cereal milk soft serve or hop on over to Milk Bar next door for corn cookies and crack pie!",

Not to mention the flavorful broth and perfectly poached egg that complimented the ingredients so well! We also ordered the pork buns which were also delicious and meatful, along with the crunchy sweat potato fries.  We had absolutely no issue getting a seat during the peak of lunch hour on a Saturday and the service was beyond satisfactory!",

Pass on the whiskey highball- to much club soda to taste the whiskey and not enough apricot to be meaningful, this cocktail could be best described as tv static in your mouth.",

The squid was well cooked but the seasoning wasn't very good. it was hot, which was fine, but it was just hot without any other real flavor, which I didn't like.  The noodles were average at best. The pickled mushrooms were great but the rest was kinda flavorless.   Service was great, very friendly and attentive.",

Forgot to take pic of the ramen, maybe because it's not my favorite dish here.   The ramen soup is on the salty side and most ramen soups are usually saltier than Chinese soup noodles.  Personally I like a more concentrated pork broth, the soup here is not as greasy or thick as the ones I have in Japan.    The price is reasonable considering the location.  Beautiful place.

The one redeeming part might be the pork buns, but they certainly needed their additional sweet and sour sauce to save it.  I ordered the bonji old fashion and it was just boring. No complexity to the flavor, just a glass of bourbon with a orange expressed over it. For my entree I got the shoyu ramen and it was bland, it was a rich dish but it wasnt rich in flavor.  $100 later I wish I went anywhere else. I have heard good things about this place but I guess I need to reevaluate where I get my advice from.",

I even mixed them together and it was heaven...The cocktails were just right. Now I cant stay in any other casino, they dont have Momofuku. Please give me more vegan dishes! Your food is amazing and I need more of it in my life. And I also read a review a few before mine that dogged David Chang and is food at this restaurant, I feel that was unfair. And I also read in the same review that the Pumkin tasted like 'a bunch of five spice' I didnt get only five spice, I got the aromatic, the smoke, the carrot and the crispy outside with soft melty inside. Thats hard to do with pumkin, I cook them a lot. Thanks David",

There were no actual truffles in the broth either, just shavings. The worst part was it was $50!!!! Also, the $50 was a surprise as it was only listed at market price on the menu. Given the other ramen noodles were $14-17, you wouldn't expect the other ramen to be dramatically different, lesson learned, MomoF***edMe.

Broth was fantastic, the poached egg done perfectly, noodles not too soft... but all of this was expected considering the popularity of the restaurant. I'd say the surprising part was the sides and appetizers. The mushroom and walnut side dish was savory. We finished the side dish before our ramen. It complimented the flavorful ramen well. Our appetizer was the cucumber and roasted almond dish. It was a great entry plate as it was light, had a little bit of heat with the chili but some opposing flavors with the cucumber and the heavy helping of almonds. This did well with the cocktails that we ordered.  We got out of there with a bill under $100 for two... pretty good considering how full we were when we left.  No room for Milk.",

    "text": "What started out as a potential disaster at Momofuku turned into a pleasant meal with friends.  Mr. Booth, Bloewen, Buxton and myself arrived a couple minutes early for an 8pm reservation.  We were told that it would be at least a 30 minute wait from that point.  We stood there asking for an update about every 10 minutes and the hostess simply said that the tables were still full.  We saw other people being seated, but for us, the table still wasn't ready.  No offers for a drink or appetizer, we were just told to wait  After I finally got angry enough to talk the manager, we were quickly seated, given a nice table, and a great server.  Things were much better from that point on.  Dishes that we had were the following: -  Raman (5 stars),  - Spicy Raman (4 stars) - Thinly sliced pork (4 stars),  - Pork chops (2 stars since it was too fatty),  - a few buns(3.5 stars),  - soft boiled eggs (2 stars - served cold which was weird)  In general, the food was very good, and i'm glad that we ended up eating at Momofuku.  And thank you for the manager for quickly resolving our problem and finding us a table.  However, it was unfortunate that the long delay occurred and the hostess team handled it so poorly.",

They seated us lovebirds at a more private location with the best view (ask for this seat if you get the chance). As expected food was delicious (fusion flavors and exotic dishes)! The service was top notch (server knew every detail about every dish! For you foodies out there this is a treat!). Our favorite dishes were the black truffle ramen, bone marrow, and the cauliflower + Brussels sprouts... and dessert was absolutely devour-worthy--cereal milk soft serve with corn flakes and a slice of crack pie!    Momofuku Las Vegas is befittingly located inside the Cosmopolitan hotel    Thank you so much to the Momofuku team for making our celebration so memorable with your hospitality and delicious food!",

    "text": "Momofuku in Las Vegas has good ambience and a great view; tables by the wall-to-wall windows are overlooking the strip and Miracle Mile shops.  Overall the food was spot on and staff were very attentive.   I tried the pork belly bun and the chicken karaage bun, both were quite tasty, but if I were to pick one to try again, I would go with the pork belly.  Pork is melt in your mouth tender and the pickled cucumbers accompanies it perfectly.  The pork ramen was the highlight of the meal.  A tasty and not too heavy broth, toothsome noodles and delicious toppings, everything one can ask of a bowl of ramen.   I also tried the chilled spicy noodles, which was also really good.  A good balance of generously sauced cold noodles under a bed of  warm crispy sichuan sausage and herbaceous fresh basil.   Finished the meal with the signature \"Crack Pie\" and it was really good! Dense and moist and lightly dusted with powdered sugar.  The great thing about everything on the dessert menu was that it was the same price inside the restaurant as the Milk Bar dessert stand right next door! No up charge for the table service! So try the cereal milk soft serve and crack pie desserts and feel at ease knowing you are paying the same price as everyone outside at the much more casual Milk Bar.   Will come back with a larger group to try the family style \"Large Format menu\" on the backside of the menu!  Momofuku meets all expectations in both food and service; a great addition to the Las Vegas dining scene.",

As for the shoyu ramen,  seems like its lacking some flavor, the broth doesn't have much of a porky flavor and was a little bland. The noodles and meat however were perfectly cooked .  Great interior decorations and staffs service! At certain side of the restaurant, you get to see part of the strip, really neat!",

Unfortunately, we didn't make it to either the lunch or dinner time frame but smack right in the middle of the afternoon. We didn't make a reservation. But guess what?? Momofuku even had a menu for the odd dinning time! It's a limited menu items but still good enough to try out whatever they had to offer.  -:::- VENUE / AMBIANCE -:::-   Love the Cosmopolitan hotel & all the good dining spots within. There really isn't a lack of good restaurants here. Momofuku is on the 2nd level within Cosmo. A pretty darn good prime & hip spot being in the middle of the Vegas strip. Due to the arrival of our time we were seated near the front of the entrance. So I never got to see the inside of the restaurant.  Ambiance was nice and the noise level was a bit loud. It was an enjoyable & relaxing atmosphere.  -:::- SERVICE  -:::-   Hostess was approachable. Our server was courteous. Service overall was fair given it was an odd time to dine but not OMG impressive. Food was served in a timely manner and our questions were answered.   -:::- FOOD  -:::-   For the 3 of us we ordered more than we should have but it was well worth it.   Whiskey Highball             [2.0/5.0]  -- Doesn't even taste like suntory toki whiskey & definitely no hint of apricot  Shoyu Pork Ramen         [4.0/5.0]  -- Overall not bad but not the best. But the pork belly was pretty damn good. This ramen is better shared. Pork Belly Buns               [5.0/5.0]      -- All 3 of us agreed that these are the best buns we've yet had   Salt & Pepper Shrimp      [5.0/5.0]   -- Perfectly & lightly tempura battered veggies & shrimp Shishito Peppers             [4.5/5.0]   -- I learned a new item called the Nooch (nutritional yeast)! I know it sounds strange but it is a game changer. Nooch's cheesy, nutty flavor is densely packed into tiny yellowish powder/flakes (like a cornmeal), making it the perfect ingredient to sprinkle over veggies for a healthy side dish.   Next time we visit Vegas, we definitely are coming back to try out their lunch or dinner items!",

Otherwise, you'll hate it because it is loaded with oodles of shaved truffles.  The big eye Tuna was suggested by our fabulous waitress, Ashley. It's so unique. It has shaved fois gras mixed with strawberries and tuna. The rich fatty texture of the fois gras combined with the sweet but somehow also tart strawberries and the fresh tuna was a taste explosion. You would never think these three ingredients go together but it works!   The beef Sichuan noodles were a treat because the dish is savory and it has some spiciness to it. It balanced eating the tuna and the truffle ramen well, because we can all use a bit more spicy in our lives right??  The pork buns were just okay that particular evening. They were a little on the tougher side even though flavorful. They didn't stand out as much from all the other stuff we ate there and are on par with other pork buns we've had at other places.   Our bartender, Adam, was awesome at dealing with my hubby because he could tell he was a bit grumpy from our trip and was probably hangry at that point. He stopped at nothing to appease his cocktail tastes and whipped up some unique concoctions not even on the menu!   Momofuku was great overall and the service really impressed us! It's a bit on the spendier side but that's to be expected in Vegas and it's worth it when you get sooooo much truffle in that ramen (wink wink)!",

Even the Cosmo is quite hot and busy but super mellow and zen inside this expansive beautiful spot! Open kitchen, gorgeous dark wood/ wood interior. Non glitter but with the strip views!   Food: snacks, ramen, noodles and main dishes. And their milk bar for dessert is right outside too but you can just order it here and beat the lines! Sugar cake, sure!  My ramen was rich, light and tasty! Super rich pork belly, light broth and tasty noodles! They bring you extra brother too! Simply delish! Spicy cucumber was their popular item and it can be a dish itself. It's rich and dense. The only thing missing was their amazing salt and pepper lobster! But that's no feat for one person! Gotta share!! With a group! Or their five spice duck!!   Add a few more baos, coffee and drinks: you have an afternoon chill spot. The staff was so nice here! So nice that I spent a couple of hours here: unplanned! Just a combination of classical music, open kitchens movement and super relaxing atmosphere ( even though it was fully packed)  and food!

The beef sichuan noodle was savory and delicious as well, although there was definitely a spice kick.   Service was really good, and food was definitely \"Vegas/ strip-priced\".",

From start to finish we had a spectacular experience. We were a group of 6 and had a nice circular table in the center of the restaurant complete with a lazy Susan on top that allowed us to easily share conversation and food. You'd be surprised how hard it is to find an adequate seating arrangement in Vegas for larger groups. Our waiter came right over to get us started with waters and drinks. he was great at answering questions we had about the menu and making recommendations.   I ordered the Shoyu Pork Ramen for myself and shared an order of Pork Belly Buns and Garlic Green beans. Everything was to.die.fooorrrr. The Pork belly in the buns just melted in your mouth and ws so full of flavor. The green beans were some of the best I ever had and probably filled up on too much because I couldn't finish my ramen hahaha. The ramen I loved as well. I asked if they had some spicy chili sauce to add because I love my ramen with a kick and the waiter said they didn't have that exactly but brought me two types of oil. Neither was super hot but together they added the little UMPH that I needed.  After my visit I learned they will be opening a location in my home town of LA and I can't wait to check that one out as well.",

My shoyu pork ramen was really flavorful and you definitely get more meat than you normally would from other ramen shops. The noodles had a nice chew which is how I like my noodles.   Because of its location on the Strip, however, you definitely pay Strip prices. Did my $17 ramen taste 70% better than a $10 bowl of ramen? I don't know, but I did enjoy my food and the service was really good. You also get plenty of food. I was barely able to finish my ramen after the pork bun appetizer. The bo ssam bowl was also very tasty with delicious pickled red onions.   The server will ask if you want still or carbonated water. It only costs $1, so it's not a big deal. You need to ask explicitly for tap if you don't want to pay for water, lol.",

None of them were as amazing as the first time. First of all, they do not have the slow roasted pork shoulder wraps anymore, and that was my favorite item. Don't confuse this with the Bo Saam Rice Bowl that is currently in the menu: I tried it and it was pretty ordinary. The picked vegetables didn't really complement well with the rice. I also came for dessert and we tried the salt and pepper lobster and shrimps and lots of desserts. The shrimps and lobsters were good but not worth the exorbitant price. And I would recommend skipping the desserts too, some were too sweet, some not enough. Would probably only come back for the pork belly buns in the future.",

It's a hip urban place that mixes the new and the old Asian (more distinctively Korean) palates.  I tried a couple dishes there with friends - I enjoyed them all, but everyone unanimously agreed that the pork belly bun was absolutely AMAZING. It was so good that we ordered another one after having a bite. The pork is grilled and charred to perfection, the cucumber adds a nice crunch, and the bun adds a pillowy soft bun bed to your bite. The waiter gave us this sweet and spicy sauce which paired very nicely with the buns.  I'm giving 4/5 just because it is a little too expensive... The Szechuan beef noodle dish was good, but I don't think it was worth $32! I'd much rather get more pork belly buns with that :)",

Miso sea bass - Fantastic.  Pork belly buns - Also, fantastic. Got to get these.  Hawaiian kanpachi - Fresh, great fish.   Creamed corn with truffle, and the shishito peppers were Le flame.    But, the only things we didn't like food-wise, we really didn't like: Chilled spicy buckwheat noodles Lamb - probably my least favorite. It was a little fatty and soft, but the vegetables served with it were perfectly done.   A little bummed about the dinner menu not having the ramen available, we and didn't like our drinks too much (Violet Femme was okay, the Garden Gnome tasted way too much like seltzer/tonic). Also, I'm a foodie. I pay a lot of money to eat well and DAYUMN, Momo be expensive.",

The it was so flavorful and the whole dish was tasty throughout.  To be honest, if our service wasn't so great, I would have given this place 4-stars just because every dish wasn't a 5... like the shishito peppers were just eh and not all of them were thoroughly cooked.  The noodles were good, but I wouldn't say anything close to 5-stars.    Overall, I'd say please go try this place and ask for Max!",

I started off with the Pork Belly Buns. They are DIVINE. Honestly I've had them so many times across the country but this was by far the best one. The bun is a soft pillow with the perfect balance of chew and fluffiness, the pork is slightly crispy on the outside but just melts in your mouth as soon as you chew in. Every bite is an explosion of flavors in your mouth. Do yourself a favor and get these.   The Ginger Scallion Noodles are so delicious. They are a perfect portion size and really excite the palate. They are rich and chewy, perfectly spiced and so very aromatic. Absolutely loved these.   I also requested my server to see if she could ask the kitchen to whip me up a ramen for dinner. It's typically on their lunch menu and not served for dinner but I really wanted to try it. She made it happen. I'm usually a die hard Tonkotsu Ramen guy because I love the deep rich porky broth; but was excited to try this Pork Shoyu Ramen. OMG it was incredible. I have no idea how they managed to fit that much flavor into a single bowl. The broth was so smokey and porky and rich and light all at the same time. The noodles were firm and chewy with a fantastic mouth feel as I slurped them up. The pork belly and the shredded roast pork were both other-worldly, so perfectly tender and delicious. Together with a poached egg and some simple toppings, every bite was a symphony of flavors, textures and aromas that would put even the most elite operas to shame.   I absolutely loved every single thing about this meal. The food was amazing, the service was impeccable, the prices were reasonable, the portions were huge and the ambiance was just so warm and welcoming. I'd very strongly recommend this place to everyone and I can't wait to go back.  p.s. Some of my friends ordered a bunch of other large plates to share family style and they really loved every single thing they had ordered too.",

    "text": "Momofuku is a 5-star experience from start to finish. To begin with, the staff is extremely professional, well-trained, and personable. While they are experts at what they do, the service refrains from feeling stuffy. The decor is gorgeous, exactly what you would expect from Vegas standards. The atmosphere is bustling and lively, with views of the open kitchen.   We came with a bachelorette party of 9 and the option was given to us for them to select our menu. All we had to do was let them know how much we wanted to spend per person and they would bring out a variety of dishes. We went with $50/pp which ended up being $90/pp once we added in drinks, tax, and tip. At that price point we were stuffed and even had leftovers, so I suppose we could have gone with a bit less.   Shishito Peppers: Blistered to perfection, these were a nice light bite that were able to make their way around the table a few times.   Pork Belly Bun: This might have been my favorite dish. The meat was beyond tender and bursting with juicy flavor and the bun was light and fluffy.  Brussels Sprouts and Cauliflower: You really can't go wrong with a brussels sprouts dish, especially when they are expertly prepared with katsu sauce, Japanese mayo and bonito.   Miso Sea Bass: Made with crab butter, mushroom and roasted vegetable broth this dish was light but packed a punch. It was another of my favorites.   Ginger Scallion Noodles: The noodles may have been ramen noodles, nice and light and curly with a flavorful sauce. I definitely recommend selecting a noodle dish because the Sichuan Beef Noodles were delicious as well.   Whole Fried Chicken: I didn't try this because I was already so full, but it was a favorite of the table. At $78 though, I wish they would have left it out in favor of more small dishes. I don't think any fried chicken can truly be worth $78.   Salt & Pepper Lobster & Shrimp: This was an add-on by one of the people in our group. The 3-4 person serving is $289 and comes with 6 lobster tails and 18 shrimp. I believe she got a smaller portion for around $150 with 2 lobster tails and less shrimp. The seafood is tempura battered then fried with garlic and chilies and finished with yuzu mayonnaise and soy glaze. There was a lot of filler in this dish. I thought the flavor was tasty but the seafood was a bit overcooked. And again, I think the price is steep.   As you can tell there is plenty to explore in the menu by way of meat, seafood and veggies all with an Asian flavor profile. Seeing as this is a David Chang restaurant, that is to be expected. I have to admit I didn't like Momofuku Noodle Bar in NY (tooooo salty) but Chang really hit it out of the park with this one. It's perfect for an extra special indulgent celebration.",

What the pho cocktail drink: 5/5 Shoyu Pork shoulder Ramen: 4/5 Bo ssam Rice bowl: 5/5  The \"What The Pho\" cocktail is something I can say I have never ever tried before. It tastes exactly like pho broth! I don't know how they did it but I love it. It has a hint of sour and alcohol flavor but other than that, just like broth. I'm realizing the way I'm describing it might make it sound gross, but I promise, it's not. Try it. Worth it.  Pork shoulder Ramen: this is the dish I was most excited for but if I'm being honest, I was disappointed in the broth flavor and consistency. when it comes to Ramen or pho, I am a broth gal over noodles. Always have been. The flavor is very good but it was very watery and not as rich as I imagined. The noodles were cooked perfectly, and everything paired well. At the end of the day, it was a good bowl of Ramen but nothing mind blowing or fantastic, which I expected from such a prestigious restaurant like Momofuku. I would prefer the Ramen from my local Ramen shop back home.  Bo Ssam Rice bowl: THIS. Was good. Packed with flavor, the rice was crispy and fluffy, the meat paired it perfectly. It was a great dish with a lot of balance. It had the crunch of the veggies but the softness of the rice, and the chewy texture of the meats. The sauce brought everything together and I would definitely recommend this dish.",

    "text": "I'm a huge fan of David Chang so I was really looking forward to trying this place. We came for lunch on a Tuesday and the place was pretty empty. It's located inside the Cosmopolitan hotel on the 2nd floor. Staff was friendly and sat us quickly. Our waitress, Tasha was wonderful! She allowed us to have sample tasting of our sake before we order. I really do love the set up and decor. The restaurant has a huge wine wall. Place is hip and modern with a classy twist. The artwork painted on the wall by David Choe gives the place it's own retro charm.   Ugh....Really hard to give it a three star, but this is solely based on the dishes we had there. I was so unimpressed by the lunch menu! I was hoping to try a couple of dishes, but there wasn't many to choose from. It was disappointedly small and limited. We end up ordering sea bass for entree and Bo Ssam rice bowl. We were delightfully welcomed with a free cold appetizer of spicy cucumber. Food was mediocre. The sea bass was tasty, but the sauce it came with was not necessary. I felt the fish was already seasoned well and adding the sauce just add too much salt to the dish. It was definitely portion for one person so if you're hungry order a side of rice or salad with it. Whyyyy....the Bo Ssam rice bowl looked so good! I was really hoping this was the dish that would steal the show, but unfortunately it felt short compared to the sea bass. The rice bowl was just overwhelming! There was just too many flavors competing against each other. You have the pickled vegetables mix with the salty/sweet braised short rib, and the seasoned rice. Each items came on top of the seasoned rice and must be mixed together. I felt the dish was just too salty and sweet. There was just too much sauce in the rice that it was hard to eat the rice itself. The spicy cucumber was ok. It was sour and salty, but was topped in a peanut sauce and peanut crumbs. I would prefer just having the cucumber the traditional Korean way...pickle. They do have some pretty good sake. We ordered the house Akita sake and it was delicious. Sadly to say not any of the three dishes we tried made me want to come back. I am glad I tried it though, but I wouldn't revisit again whenever in Vegas.",

    "text": "After binging David Chang's Ugly Delicious (and bonus Christina Tosi/Milkbar from Chef's Table) on Netflix, I was very excited to have the chance to eat at one of these restaurants!   We came here for our 5 year anniversary (made the reservation online and just put a little note of the special occasion). They sat us next to the window, which we loved! We also got to have a complimentary toast of champagne or sparkling wine (I forgot what our server said lol) because of our anniversary, which I thought was a nice touch to the night.   We ordered the grilled Japanese squid and the heritage pork chop, as well as the pork belly buns to start. They know how to do pork! The pork chop was the best -- each piece was the right amount of fatty and full of flavor.  The squid was also good but I think I was so obsessed with the pork chop I didn't pay much attention to it lol.   My only issue with the food was that for the price, I would've wanted it the squid to come with a starch/side as well as the entrees. I know that's normal for a lot of places to have to order it separately, but just eating squid and mayo with no veggies wasn't cutting it for me.  In the end though, it was good food and a good experience, will definitely want to come back and try one of their large format dinners... I'm eyeing out that duck dish!",

Without a doubt, everyone at the table agreed that it was the best wagyu beef we had.  The dishes were impeccable. Full of robust flavor but simmered and balanced well.  Our side favorite was the Brussels and Cauliflower and the grilled corn.  Place is energetic and hard to hear.  Dress attire is casual from posh casual to street fashion.  It is hopping and lively at night.    Service can be spotty.  No fresh cutlery when switching to the small plates to the large format.  We had to ask for refill on non alcoholic beverages though they did ask for for refill on alcoholic beverages....I think they were only looking out for the drinkers. HMMM",

I dined I'm on a weekday and made a reservation for 1130am, hoping to beat the lunch rush. When I arrived I was seated immediately   I ordered the shishito peppers (a little spicy and way too much in my opinion) and pork buns (yum!!) for entrees I ordered a duck bowl dish - Their menu has changed since I visited and I don't see it any longer. It was too fatty for my preference, but that is how duck is, so I should consider not ordering any kind of duck dish in the future. It did have a ton of flavor though.",

Came for a mid-afternoon snack and ordered the pork ramen (melts in your mouth pork belly), spicy shishito peppers and watermelon beer.  Sat at the bar area and our server was very attentive. The chefs were really friendly too. They gave us a free beer cuz they couldn't figure out an issue with their beer tap at first. Also, one of the chefs gave us a free appetizer - baked fingerling potatoes with truffle cream, Parmesan cheese and chives - soooooo yummies!! Definitely recommend the pork ramen, spicy shishito peppers (really good with beer), potato appetizer, and local watermelon beer (limited batch - summer only). Great experience!! ^_^",

    "text": "We didn't seek this place out but we were returning a rental car to the Cosmopolitan and had passed by it earlier in the day. Our friends really wanted to visit here because the New York versions had always been so crowded, and this one was empty on a Friday at 5:30-- too good to pass up. We learned this incarnation combines the menus from their other locations into one restaurant, if anything because they have the space to-- it's huge!  We mentioned we were in a bit of a time crunch to make an evening show and our waitress made sure our food came out as soon as it was ready-- in some cases the mains made it out before the appetizers.   We had pork ramen, kimchi stew, the ham small plate, shishito peppers and a slice of crack pie to share (which, even though it looked small for the 5 of us, was plenty). If I had to dig for a minor complaint it's that the ramen broth was so rich and with so much sodium I was quite thirsty for hours after our meal even while drinking several glasses of water with dinner.   We left full and in about an hour, which left us plenty of time for the rest of our evening. By the time we left the rest of the restaurant was starting to fill up.   Yes, it was expensive (for ramen), but this restaurant executed on all cylinders- service, food, etc were all top notch.",

    "text": "If you are like me, you probably heard of David Chang after watching him on \"The Mind of A Chef\" and his dorky quality was endearing and on some level you kind of related to his off the cuff nonchalant way he presented himself. Kind of disheveled, potentially high and lover of salty food. LOVE IT.   So you would not believe my surprise when I was staying at the Cosmopolitan Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas when I heard there was a Momofuku and Milk Bar... I practically hightailed it there the second I could.   We kept it simple and ordered the Scallion Ginger Noodles, the Benton Ham Mussels and the Pork Belly and Chicken Karaage bun.   In most to least liked: Bun(s), Mussels, and the Ginger Scallion Noodles. And here is why:   The buns were ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS. They serve it with the ssam sauce, the pork belly was cooked to perfection. Low and slow and then lightly crisped, served with some hoisin and cucumbers it's perfection in a bun. The chicken one was equally delicious and if I had to write about it, it would go like this- \"Get the chicken Karaage you (insert expletive)!\"   The Mussels are dry roasted meaning they are put on a hot griddle and cooked like that until they open. Then they are tossed with benton ham bits that seems to have been reduced with onions. It's equally salty, sweet and fully of flavor. I just wished they served it with some buns or bread so you could soak up the liquid at the bottom, but that's only a small slight.   Then the Ginger / Scallion noodles.... this I was the most disappointed in. I would have asked for salt from the staff, but my mother taught me never to say anything if I only had bad things to say. The flavor was ultra subtle and lacked some depth aside from the ginger/scallion oil tossed with the noodles. The shitake's and cucumbers that accompanied the dish were good, but didn't add much in my opinion.   Overall- I would come back. I liked the food I ordered and would come back to try the other things on the menu. Specifically the $60 bowl of truffle ramen.... the only reason I didn't order it was I didn't want to seem boujee in front of the person I was with...you know who you are.   Anyways, for sure check this place out if you have a chance, it's worth a stop anytime.",

Originally thought this was a sushi restaurant. I approached the hostesses and asked what kind of food it was and they responded with \"do you want to see the menu\" which, I definitely did, but would have been delighted if they gave me a few words on their style of dining. They sat me immediately at the bar, and the bartender was super engaging. He asked me what kind of food I was interested in getting and I said vegetarian. He provided me with options, and was very detailed in his descriptions. I had a mushroom bun, a bizarre but tasty spicy almond cucumber appetizer (that he suggested) and the chick pea ramen. All of which were wonderful. The bartender accidentally gave me a bun instead of the cucumber appetizer but was very quick to correct his mistake. Apologized, and comped it. I was impressed and plan to come back very soon !",

    "text": "What happened here?  Momofuku came to Vegas and left behind everything that makes the NY versions great - ambiance, mystery, energy, and good food.  I came in with high expectations and was really disappointed.  Pricing, while in line for a strip restaurant, is too high.  We started at the bar, which was wet and dirty, with a bar staff that scowls at you.  This team feels like angry hipster bartenders straight out of central casting.  The cocktails were not well executed and quite frankly they were overly sweet.  Table service is jumbled and weird, putting a smooth dining experience out of reach.  Not a single manager could be seen on the floor.  If they had been there, they would have had a chance to check on the bathrooms which were filthy.  Water and paper was everywhere.  Maybe the person before me decided to use the bidet feature on the Japanese toilet to do their own version of the Bellagio fountain show - who knows.    Food was not up to par, and certainly not at the level delivered in NY.  Soft Boiled Eggs lacked any seasoning - it was just plain missed.  Pork Belly Buns lacked pork.  Kimchi Stew was good, but it was so spicy that I had to keep going back to the buns to cool off.  Ginger Scallion Noodles featured the mushiest noodles you've ever tried.  The only dish worth trying again was the Citrus Cured Fluke which was outstanding.  It was Monday night and the place empty, yet we were rushed through our meal.  The only saving grace of the meal was selections from Milk Bar next door.  The crack pie was it's usual good self, and the cake truffles were outstanding.  But after a $300 meal for three people we still left hungry.",

Actually it was EXTREMELY salty. At first I thought it was just my bowl but my mom's bowl and bf bowl was also very salty. To be specific, the level of saltiness in each bowl was different. Mine wasn't the saltiest but my mom's bowl was so bad, she had already asked for four cups of water. Not to mention, we also asked for lemon wedges and room temp water to help lighten the soup... that didn't work either. Very disappointing meal because it was recommended by so many of my friends. On the bright side, the pork belly bun was good. Service was okay and thank you to our bust boy who came with filling our water cup consistently. I'd love to give this place another try but probably try something different.",

    "text": "It's exciting to see Momofuku slowly making their way over from New York all the way to LA, with their pitstop here at the Cosmopolitan. This fancy Asian-fusion restaurant seems to be \"known\" for their ramen, but I would have to disagree and say that the real fortunes come in their main entrees which looked pretty damn good.  Given that it's a higher-end restaurant, a reservation on a busy Saturday evening is absolutely necessary. Our party of nine was able to get our own long table with a great view of the Strip. At night, it lights up the area where you don't need to have lights on inside the restaurant to give you a great dining atmosphere.  Our waiter was quick to serve us still or sparkling water- whatever your choice! We kicked things off with their oysters ($12 for half a dozen), which were a tasty treat. The freshness quality was certainly up there.  Being on a bit of a budget crunch, I ended up choosing their Chilled Spicy Noodles with Sichuan sausage ($14). At first glance, the portions seemed fairly small. However, once you mixed everything together, it became a spicy, delectable medley of flavors. Absolutely loved all the ingredients and kick the noodles had. No broth needed.  While my noodles were good, my friends meals didn't seem to live up to the hype. The Ginger Scallion Noodles were way too salty, which prompted them to comp the two bowls our table ordered. My other friend ordered a chicken dish that was fairly dry. So good and bad, there seemed to be some inconsistency in the kitchen offerings from that evening. Hopefully they can fix that for future customers.  Momofuku is definitely worth a try if you're feeling classy Asian. Give it a whirl before you head out to your late night adventures.",

We went here for a team dinner, with plans to potentially go out for a night on the town alter. Unsure of what to order, we just told them to bring out enough food for the 9 (or 10) of us.  Honestly, everything was sooo delicious. We started off with some shishito peppers and pork belly buns, always good. The other large dishes that came out were the Bo Ssam, 5 Spice Rotisserie Duck, and the Salt & Pepper Lobster and Shrimp. So these dishes were all really good and we were too full to even finish it all, but for me, the Salt & Pepper Lobster and Shrimp really stood. Seems like a simple dish to make, but that fried Lobster was top notch. I would normally think that frying lobster would cheapen the flavor, but it definitely added to it. And there was plenty of lobster for everyone to have, which isn't an easy thing to do.  You visit Vegas, this is a place you MUST try. Definitely coming here the next time I'm here.",

The decor was modern and minimalist. The host was friendly and led us to a table with a view of the Eiffel Tower duplicate. The menu design was clean. Our waiter was funny, knowledgeable, and attentive.   We ordered:  kampachi - fresh, but the sauce was salty Pork belly bun - alright  Shishito pepper with nutritional yeast - tasty and/because greasy  Kimchi fried rice - not enough kimchi, not enough rice  Veggie ramen - handmade noodle with fresh and flavorful veggies, again, tapa size  The food quality is likely higher than your average Vegas restaurant. The restaurant's target client group is clearly people who do not wish to be labeled \"picky eater\" or \"non-adventurous eater\"; even though they might well qualify either. this group looks for something \"exotic\" but not authentic. This restaurant approach, including elevated decor and the Asian fusion label, attracts and/or even educates people who are scared to step out of their food comfort zone.   However, if you grew up with immigrant parents, if you brought homemade lunch to school and got laughed at, if the entirety of your identity was evil-spiritedly equated to a dish, if you frequent hole-in-the-wall, mom-and-pop restaurants or food stands in LA's Koreatown or San Gabriel Valley, this is not the high light of your Vegas trip. This will disappoint.",

It's hard to find great service at restaurants so I am so happy that we actually were able to get this kind of service.   The place is a good size with art decor on the wall. We sat near a window which gave us a nice view of the planet Hollywood. When we were sat we were greeted right away and our our server was nice enough to give us his opinion on our many questions.   We went with his suggestion of the half portion of the Bo Ssam since it was on the large portion side of the menu. We also got oysters, dry roasted mussels, a spicy cucumber appetizer, pork belly buns, unagi buns, truffle potatoes, Brussels sprouts and cauliflower, and pork ramen(which isn't on the dinner menu but we asked for it). Everything was really great and I love how our plates and utensils were changed with pretty much every dish we ate.   I highly recommend the pork belly buns! Also, we were celebrating our friends birthday so our server brought out a crack pie dessert for him, which was so good !   Overall, I would come here again to try other things on their menu. Their service is great and their food that I tried was really great!",

The lunch menu is also a great way to try their food at affordable prices.   My hubby and i ordered the pork ramen and chickpea ramen as well as the shrimp bun and pork bun. For a drink, i has the Yuzu lemonade.  The yuzu lemonade was $9 bucks, a little pricey, but really refreshing. It has more hints of sourness from The yuzu but i found it to be a nice complement to the lemonade.  The buns came out next and i just want to say, those little buns are made of clouds and are as soft as Charmin! The pork bun was just divine with its crispy pork belly! The shrimp bun, which really had a shrimp patty on it turned out to be very flavorful as well.   But to me, the highlight of the meal was the pork ramen. The way they get their pork belly so crispy is amazing and perfectly complements the texture and flavor of the ramen. The soft boiled egg, the noodles, the broth..just all so good! My mouth is watering from it! My husband had the chickpea ramen and really liked it as well. I tried one of his chickpeas and it was super crispy and freshly made! You could tell!  The ambiance during lunch is chill. The staff are super nice and helpful. We made our reservation for 11:30am and by the time it was noon, most of the tables were filled.   I cant stress how important it is to make a pit stop here while in Vegas! I cant wait to go again and try more!",

Noodles were similar and the pork, as usual, was a standout   Had a chance to try the potatoes, 100% home run and worth getting again and again   Service was friendly and accommodating   Overall Thoughts  While NYC didn't win me over, the LV location certainly changed my point of view",

The crispy fried shrimp patty was probably the best thing I tried though.  The spicy cold noodles were surprising. I wouldn't get this if you're looking for something actually spicy but the Thai basil pesto sauce was very good and paired well with the slightly sour peppers.   My friend got the pork ramen and I tried some of it. Glad I didn't get it because it was very average but the pork belly itself was decent.  Overall slightly overpriced for the quality of food but a decent meal nonetheless.",

    "text": "Visited for lunch with 5 other first-timers. We chose Momofuku because it is in our hotel (Cosmopolitan) & Japanese food sounded good. Well, Momofuku is not strictly a Japanese restaurant, it draws from Japanese, Chinese, Thai, Korean (& other) cuisines. Also, initially, I didn't know what kind of restaurant It was because the decor is neutral & modern, with lots of wood & metal, not \"Asian\". Our food was very good, though generally pretty spicy. I had the Chilled Spicy Noodles - Sichuan sausage, Thai basil, candied cashews, jalapenos & red cayenne peppers on top of a pesto pasta - highly recommended by another Yelper, and it was terrific!   The dish didn't taste chilled ... more warm/room temperature, and that was fine. Even though I removed all the peppers, the dish was delicious and hella spicy, though not excessively or painfully so. Very delicious, though be forewarned, when they say \"Spicy\" they ain't kiddin' ! ;)  I'd read that the Confetti Cake was good, so I ordered it, realized my sister's birthday was the next day, asked our server Chris was if he'd put a candle in the cake, and he brought it out along with candle, dessert plates & forks! We were all happy with Chris' attentiveness & efficiency!  Others in our group ordered the Pork Ramen, which they are famous for and which about half their customers seemed to order while we were there, Bo Saam Rice Bowl, a Pork Belly Bun, and a Shrimp Bun. Everyone loved the food!",

I got a steaming hot bowl of delicious savory ramen with generous thick chunks of pork belly and slices of pork shoulder. The pork belly was not fatty which impressed me since oftentimes restaurants just give you pure lard which I hate. The noodles were chewy and so filling. It was a generous portion and I don't know why the other reviewers had said it was too little food. I could not finish my noodles and not for lack of trying. I  had the pork belly buns as well. Also very yummy. Love it! The bartender was also amazing!",

    "text": "Momofuku is a nice gateway restaurant to those who never had authentic Korean food or maybe cannot stand authentic flavor.    My party ordered shoyu pork ramen, Bo Ssam bowl, Denver steak, and a pork belly bun.    As a Korean who grew up with Korean food, food was interesting but I can see why a lot of Korean people especially elderlies will be disappointed.  David Chang is very popular in Korean community and even in Korea due to media exposure, which is why you'll see many Korean tourist from Korea in the store.    The flavor for ramen, bossam, and pork belly bun had interesting flavor coming from American/Western cuisine perspective.  I get hint of authentic Korean dish and flavor that David Chang was going for.  And it is for definitely more for those coming from American/Western cuisine who are not ready for authentic Korean flavor/ want their familiarity with hint of something bit exotic than from Asian who wants fusion of western.  David Chang, born and raised in the States who caters toward the US crowd definitely hit his target demographic.    I do have my preference of ramen, my preference of bossam and pork belly.  It was interesting to taste a different interpretation of Korean food and ramen, but I suppose it's not really for me.  And it is not for me.  I'm not the target demography.  Neither are tourists from Korea (especially elderly) who insist on having daily Korean meals included in their tour in foreign countries.  I'm glad David Chang is making ways to showcase to demography who may not otherwise have chance to come across Korean food.    Maybe recommendation would be to bring little bit of Korea to the States.   Many people who's been to Korea have said that they love the ding dong man (little buzzer at the table in every Korean restaurant) and would love to bring it back to their country.  Maybe David Chang can implement that to the restaurant to show little piece of Korean convenience.",

Knowing my family and my mom, they are super picky and hard to please.  Luckily, momofuku did not let me down! We were a party of 7 adults and 1 kid and we ordered the following \"large format dining\" items from their menu.  Salt and Pepper Lobster an Shrimp: super yummy! Lightly fried and crunchy! Nice as an appetizer for the table Five spice duck: pretty traditional flavors for Asian duck! The duck fat drizzled on to the rice is perfect!  Bo Saam: huge huge portions of meat and super tender! This item was totally worth it  All dishes were amazing and worth it. Loved the experience and can't wait for my next excuse to dine here.",

I already knew it would be amazing before I had the first bite. Just the aroma of the broth - makes my mouth water.  And they actually sear up the pork belly, so that it has a nice crispy texture.  So amazing.     This just made it onto my \"have to eat every time I'm in Vegas\" list.",

The restaurant is huge and is well staffed.  Pop music playing in the background and nice manga-style art adorning the walls.  We came here for lunch and frankly, the results were mixed.  My wife's pork ramen was incredibly oily and the pork belly had gobs of fat.  The noodles were chewy, and they did use a slow-poached egg, just like in the Momofuku book.  The oiliness was a major turnoff (2 stars).  The dishes I ordered were much better:  Cucumber Salad - I loved how each cucumber chunk had a thin layer of avocado, and was topped with nuts for crunch and seasoned with spicy pepper. (4 stars)  Pork Belly Bao with home-made Ssam sauce was excellent, and was decent sized. Pork belly here looked better than in my wife's ramen (4 stars)  Fried Chicken - This was half a chicken with four pieces.  Very good seasoning on the crispy skin, and most of the chicken meat was juicy.  It reminds me a bit of that golden crispy chicken that's popular in Chinese banquets, only the Momofuku version had a slight spicy kick which I liked. (4 stars)  Probably not our favorite place for noodle craving in Las Vegas (Shang Artisan Noodles and Bellagio Noodles seem better).  Still, good non-ramen dishes and very friendly and attentive service.",

I think they meant 3 football players.  It was so much food for 4 girls.  We didn't even make a dent in it, it felt like.  It was really good value though, breaking down to about a little over 30 per person. The pork was very tender.  The oysters were a nice touch, but i didn't particularly like it combined.  I ate my oysters mostly separate after the first one.  Of course we had to try a ton of other things, so the other items I had a sample of that I also very much enjoyed were: 1) the steamed pork bun 2) some crudo dish (I think they are always changing the type of fish b/c i went back to look at the menu it seemed different than what I had) 3) spicy thai noodles - very good 4)beet salad - i don't normally like beets, but this was actually very good and refreshing  Also had a cocktail - the Penicillin - which was pretty tasty.",

Being new to ramen and having an extensive visit to dozens of other ramen places recently. I decided to finally give it a go.  Upon arriving, no res, by the way. I made my way to the bar where I was greeted promptly and with kindness by a one Leah. Offered a cocktail and beer list. (Beer list is eh) but the cocktails showed promise.  Leah had suggested all of her favorite drinks, both to have and create. I ended up trying a handful actually. But the whole time I had a blast. Her service never faltered and she was able to tend the bar with such finesse I couldn't believe it.  When I finally concluded my evening and decided to throw in the towel. I paid up my bill and Leah had wished me safe travels and to come back soon.  Halfway to my car I realized that I didn't even try the ramen!!!  All that being said. I'll be going back not only for the ramen this time. But for the amazing service I was given. Thanks again Leah!! You were the absolute best!!",

    "text": "Overly hyped, overpriced and underwhelming. There's better food around the corner. I went to the Saam bar in NYC a couple months back which was a far better experience than my experience here in Vegas.  1. Vibe Similar feel to its sister stores in NYC, lots of bamboo accents and hipster Japanese decor. I came here for lunch and it was pretty busy.   2. Service I was a bit disappointed with the service I received here. I was seated at the bar right away and given water but then my server/bartender disappeared for 15 minutes so I couldn't place my order. Upon placing my order, I asked for more water and was ignored again. Food didn't come out for another 15 minutes, at this point I was pretty annoyed but was killing time so I decided to stay. When the food came out, I asked for my check and ended up getting that right away...  3. Presentation Food was presented okay, I felt like everything was just tossed together on a plate since they were pretty easy. Half a point for this.  4. Taste We got the pork belly buns, ramen, and chilled spicy noodle bowl. The pork belly buns were pretty tasty-pork was moist, succulent, and I loved how the pickled cucumbers balanced the saltiness of the hoisin sauce. I wasn't a big fan of the ramen, as the broth was really salty, I had to dilute it with some water. I had to get another slice of that pork belly to put into the ramen broth though! SO GOOD! The chilled spicy noodle bowl was a cross between a noodle salad with basil pesto dressing, surprisingly good, and light which was perfect since I didn't want anything heavy.  5. Value For what it is Momofuku is overhyped and overpriced for what we received. $7/pork bun, $17 spicy chilled noodle bowl, and $18 for pork ramen is a bit steep. This is a place you'd visit once just to see what it's like but it's not a place you'd come to every time you're in town.",

It is in a great location right in the Cosmopolitan and it's sister company, Momofuku Milk Bar, if you want to get anything from a milkshake to a crack pie (this is amazing. It's a frozen pie thing. All I can say is that it is delicious). I seriously recommend the pork buns. They look really chewy and thick but in actuality it is tender and juicy. Add a little of the ssam sauce and it becomes heaven. The pork ramen is also amazing. They controlled the spices to almost complete perfection and it is a perfect meal for any day, hot or cold.

I know how the craze is going for ramen places but the chickpea miso ramen was pretty good. It was a good sized bowl and not overwhelming which is nice...I don't like getting a bowl of ramen that makes me feel like I'm in a contest or something. On the side my party also ordered the pork belly buns and shrimp buns...i would order the pork belly again. I look forward to coming here again. In my mind it fit the bill because, even thought it's Vegas, it didn't feel pretentious...maybe because Chang would just say \"F*ck that sh*t\" and make it his own.",

    "text": "Wow just wow... this place really lived up to it's name. We snagged seats at the bar on a crowded Saturday night. The bartenders were fantastic, I would recommend going this route! They spent a lot of time talking about the food and just chatting in general with our group. Gave us some of the intimate background of food options and history. It was splendid.   Honeycrisp Apple Salad - Fan F8#$ tastic. Crisp and refreshing  Grilled Lamb Ribs - Holy wow, these melted off the bone with fantastic flavor   Dry Roasted Mussels - I've never had dry mussels before so I was a little weary, as often the sauce is the best part. These were flavorful in every bite.   Crispy Potatoes - yup! Delicious they're a must get  The buns are obviously amazing. I was a fan of the shrimp more than the pork belly.   The bartenders let us order the ramen (which they only have on their lunch menu) and it was fantastic.",

Located in the mall attached to the Cosmopolitan this awesome restaurant is filled with yummy smells.  As the food was awesome the service was absolutely perfect.  We sat at the bar and watched the talented Zac perform his magic as he prepared eye and palate pleasing dishes. Our waiter Darien was very attentive and provided excellent service.  So happy we popped in.  Delicious, affordable, and great service.",

They have small options to eat, which are expensive, and then they have \"shareable portions\" for 2-4 people depending on which you pick.... but those options are around $250 each!!!! Unless you want to go and spend crazy amounts of money for not very much food, I wouldn't suggest dinner her. Service wasn't great, we decided to get up and walk out after being there for about 20 minutes and hardly ever seeing our server.",

    "text": "Was treated to a really lovely dinner here with two of my GFs and our server, Jenna, masterfully worked us through a handful of courses in a severely limited window of time (due to us arriving late and needing to leave an hour after sitting down - totally our fault).  I'm sad I don't have photographic evidence of the meal since my phone died the day after getting home from Vegas, but know that those photos were worthy of being printed and compiled into a coffee table book, and that's not because of the photographer!   Started out with spicy cucumbers...very refreshing and crisp, with just the right amount of kick to them. The Bigeye Tuna with shaved foie gras on top (heaven!) and stone fruit was heaven. The tuna was already perfect, but then adding that soft, melt-in-your-mouth foie gras shavings was magical. The Dry Roasted Mussels was a surprise hit (as none of us are particular shell fish fans)...umm...no mussel meat was left in that dish...and we soaked up the juices of that bowl with whatever we could that was lying around. Everyone should add bacon and furikake to their mussels! The Ginger Scallion Noodles were no match for us ladies...they were gone before you could say Momofuckyeah. We could have gone for three more of those.    But, the star was The Branzino...this fish was so meaty, but each section was delicate and flaky with the brown butter dashi flavor shining through in each bite...I would swim with that fish...and then subsequently bite its head off.  Dessert (crack pie) and drinks were on point, also, and again, service was flawless.   Excited for them to make their LA debut towards the end of the year!",

    "text": "Huge WOW. I've been to a couple of Momofuku's in NYC - Saam Bar, Nishi, and Milk Bar, all wonderful experiences. I was super excited to try the one that opened in Las Vegas! Finally something on the west coast!  This restaurant is quite different from the other ones in NYC. It seems like each restaurant in NYC focuses on a different theme - ramen, fine dining, different meats, etc. This Momofuku in Las Vegas though, seems to be a mix of all of the themes together. In general, it was a big mix of Asian fusion. See dishes below.   Food:  -Shishito Peppers - smoked salt, lime. Damn. This was a fantastic appetizer to share. I knew ahead of time that 1 in 8 peppers is spicy - but we learned from the manager that night that if they're in season, the spiciness is intensified. So they were in season, and we were howling like a MOFO. The peppers were fantastic though. I loved the lime powder they sprinkled on - so tasty. Read my service note below for what happened to calm our spicy mouths. They gave us a lot of peppers, totally worth the $9.  -Pork Belly Bun with  hoisin, scallion, cucumber - This is a must order. It's their famous bun! So delicious. The pork belly was great. They also bring out their special \"ssam sauce,\" which just ties together all the ingredients. The bun is pretty big, so feel free to share this one if you just want a taste.  -Salt & Pepper Lobster & Shrimp - fried chilies & garlic. WHOA. This was a knockout dish. The lobster and shrimp were deep fried - just like a Chinese dish. However, it was the addition of the lobster that was just so amazing. This part was the fusion part. They gave us a lot of lobster, and the lobster was SO PERFECTLY COOKED. Soft, chewy at all. Just perfect. Omg. We've never had a dish like that before! This was a huge dish, for 2 people to share. -Ginger Scallion Noodles - pickled shiitake, cucumber, wakame. We just had to order noodles at some time during our meal! These were excellent. At first I thought I was ordering ramen, but they arrived at our table, there was no soup lol. Just noodles on bottom, covered with the wakame seaweed, mushrooms, and cucumber. The noodles were soaked in this olive oil that was prepared for hours, our waiter told us. OMG. The flavors were just so incredible! It tasted like there was a secret ingredient in there, like butter or something with meat, but NO - JUST OLIVE OIL. I couldn't believe it - vegetarian dish that tasted so rich! This dish could make anyone go vegetarian. Noodles cooked to perfection too - not overdone, but nice and soft.  -Birthday Cake - I think they feature this cake from next door's Momofuku Milk Bar. It was so fun to try this cake - it's so pretty, and just reminds you of your childhood. The cake was tasty, but frosting a little sweet. I was glad I tried it though - every table was getting it that night, it seemed.   Overall, food was fantastic. One bummer is that they change their menu very frequently - so what you see on Yelp in pictures is not always something you can order that night when you're dining. I mean, this is a good and bad thing. I really loved all the dishes we did order, though! Another bummer is that there's a whole separate \"group menu\" on the back, which has larger entrees for groups of 4-6 people. We wanted to order from here too, but knew it'd just be too much food. This is a great place to go with your friends though.   Service: SO outstanding here. I really felt taken care of. When we had the shishito peppers, and unfortunately had the spicy ones, the manager of the restaurant came to our rescue and offered us some soft serve from the Momofuku Milk Bar next door to help us calm our taste palates! WOW. Everyone was so friendly here too - I felt like our waiter Erik and the whole team were a bunch of our friends. Kinda weird I say that - but that's the vibe they give off. Amazing experience.  Ambiance: Modern, cool, vibe. It honestly felt like a restaurant in LA to me (not a bad thing!). They had lazy susan's for the larger group tables. Japanese toilet in the restroom. Played Snoop Dogg and old Kanye West for the tunes. Just our idea of perfect!  I actually enjoyed this restaurant slightly more than the ones I had in NYC. I really liked the fusion aspect of being able to try all of David Chang's specialties in one restaurant. This is a great winner!!! I will return on my next Vegas trip!!!",

The ambience of the restaurant was great! The reason for the low rating is because of the service. We were really disappointed with our waiter's response time. We had to find our own water.

This food is INCREDIBLE.\" We were lucky enough to be seated at the Executive Chef's table/bar, and what was destined to be a great meal turned into a phenomenal experience. Our personal bartender, Joshua, was excited to show us what Momofuku had to offer, and his excitement and passion permeated the atmosphere, increasing our pure enjoyment to extraordinary levels. From the first sip of our very original, hand-crafted cocktails and exquisitely curated wines, to the last bites of our delectable meals and refreshing melon granita, we were in heaven. Chef Shaun King, you are a genius and a god among chefs. The pork chop that I ordered was, by far, the best pork that I have EVER eaten (yes, even better than straight-up bacon), and you have ruined pork for me forever. We will be back, and I hope that that pork is on the menu. I am eternally grateful for Chef David Chang and his amazing ability to meld great food, good drinks, and an incredible atmosphere into the temple of nourishment that is Momofuku.",

We ordered the fried chicken with caviar the day before and ordered other dishes which I will review in more detail: -- Fried chicken with caviar for $380.  Fried chicken was salty.  While the dish is unique and maybe worth a try once, I would never recommend this to anyone.   -- Shishito peppers.  Can't go wrong with this. -- Pork belly.  This was a hit and everyone enjoyed it and ordered more.   -- Lobster and shrimp with garlic and pepper.  Good but definitely not a unique dish.  Have had better in authentic asian restaurants -- Scallops.  You will go hungry if you order this as your only entree.  It came out with 2 scallops only with greens.  Definitely not worth the price. -- Waghu beef:  Order 2 oz and cost $70.  This was the most shocking item on their menu by far and I think anyone is crazy to order this.  They came out with a cart with a salt block, torch and a very very tiny piece of beef.  They cut it into 4 pieces - imagine spam slices.  They put these thin slices on the salt block and torched it.  What do you get??? Very very expensive spam pieces for over $10 a slice.  My total bill for 8 people was $1200 and left very unsatisfied !!!!",

The pork belly buns are amazing worth the hype. The pork belly is perfect and the cucumber cuts through the grease. The ramen is solid. Not as thick of a broth but lots of flavor. The bigeye tuna is a really balanced plate as the richness of the foie gras is cut down when shaved and surprisingly pairs really well with the fresh fish and the strawberries. The combination is really unique. Best dish surprisingly IMHO is the Sichuan lamb ribs, the meat slipped right off the bones, perfectly cooked, super flavorful and paired well with the sauce. Amazing. The only dish I would stay away from are the ginger scallion noodles. Didn't work. Way too much on the garlic. Kind of a buttery bland flavor. Really a disappointment to an otherwise stellar menu. Also what I liked is that I was traveling alone and this place didn't make me feel awkward about dining alone. Sitting at the noodle bar is fun and you get a cool view of the open kitchen.  Service is also top notch and wasn't ignored for dining alone as you get in other places.",

    "text": "Had dinner here in July 2017. The pork belly buns were great. But then I ordered their $90 steak. I was shocked at how bad the steak was. It was seriously one of the worst steaks I've had anywhere at any price! The meat was very tough with very little flavor. My friend was laughing at me as I tried to gnaw though it like leather. However, I mentioned it to the Manager when she stopped by to check on us and she graciously apologized and removed the charge for the steak. I'll be back to try something else next time in Vegas because of how she handled it.  But man, what a big disappointment given how much hype this place has.",

    "text": "Super disappointed . We were expecting more . Had the between lunch and dinner bar menu which I know is limited but what is on there should be pretty good . The pickle plate was just meh . The pickled items were ok not sure what I expected but for 17.00 was expecting something different I guess . Should be something they give you on a smaller plate when you walk in for free honestly . Had the cold green spicy noodles with sausage as well. They were ok  nothing to write home about the sausage was pretty overpowering . What I told my friend is this same 90.00 meal we had (with a beer and a cocktail ) for lunch . We could have had a way better meal on spring mountain or any number of places in Vegas for half the price . The locals will keep you rolling . Had higher expectations because of chef Chang but we were let down . Will go back and try again for dinner and hopefully it will change our mind .",

Came here for our reservation at 6:30 and was seated within 5 minutes. We started off with their soft boiled egg ($15). The egg had a smokey flavor, the yolk was runny and covered with roe and crispy rice. Super yummy but felt guilty for paying that much for two eggs. Next we got their pork buns ($14 ) perfect small bite but did not have much inside aside from the pork slice. Another pricey bite at $7 a bun. We got their oysters ($26) which was fresh but nothing out of this world. Their prime New York steak ($62) was really good. They had a light and flavorful sauce over their perfectly cooked steak. Had a good amount of steak on the plate so money well spent. The last dish that came was the pork ramen($18) I would not order this again. It was very bland and barely any pork. And come on, $18 for a small bowl of boring noodles?? Mmm no thank you. But overall loved the vibe of this place, food was pricey but that was expected. Will come back to try different dishes.",

[ Service ] Top-notch! the server was friendly and gladly went over the menu for us with all the recommendations and most popular dishes. He also stopped by a couple of times to ask if we needed anything else. Thank you for that! They're so on top of it, it's like they knew I would be dehydrated from the night before and refilled my water over 6 times that meal.   [ Food ]  - Pork Belly Bun $7 -- steamed bun filled with a thick and tender piece of pork belly on top of a thin layer of cucumbers with hoisin sauce. YUM! If you are to pick one thing on the menu, I would definitely start with one of their buns. - Shoyu Pork Ramen $17 -- ramen with pork belly, pork shoulder, and a poached egg. It's good, but I'm honestly not as impressed as I should be. I wished they would make the Japanese marinated soft boiled egg instead.  - Brussels Sprouts & Cauliflower $10 -- veggies cooked in fish sauce vinaigrette and chilles. I really enjoyed this dish, but be warned that fish sauce makes it saltier than you would expect! - Crispy Sole Katsu $29 -- I think I ordered too much food at this point.. anyways in case you did not catch it from the name of the dish, it's fish katsu not pork! I really liked the batter on the outside of their sole katsu. It's not extra oily like KFC, but rather light LIKE tempura... but not tempura. It comes with scallion rice, lettuce wraps, kimchi, and a sriracha aioli kind of sauce.",

    "text": "We made reservations here for my sister's birthday, and our request for a booth table by the windows was honored even though we arrived about half an hour early.  They have great views of the Strip if you are sitting facing the windows, just really nice :)  It was an overall pleasant experience: on top of the nice view, service was great and the food was quite tasty.  On our first visit, we ordered shrimp buns (so delicious!), pork belly ramen (richer than I'm used to but still good), shishito peppers (I didn't have any), and Crack Pie and Cereal Milk soft serve.    The next morning, I went on the Momofuku Las Vegas website to see how late they were going to be open to figure out if we'd be able to make it there before closing after our show.  I was pretty excited when I found out they had expanded their hours and were starting lunch service!  We cancelled our lunch reservation that we had elsewhere and made a new one for Momofuku instead.  I requested the same table we had the night before and they were able to give it to us :)  We had a different server and different busboys but they were just as good as the ones the night before.  We ordered shrimp buns (had to get them again!), Market Greens salad, and Fried Brussel Sprouts on this visit.  We passed on dessert since we really wanted a Crack Pie Milkquake but it was not offered on the dessert menu.    Yes, I went here for two meals in a row :p  I'd love to come back and try their fried chicken sandwich, which I recently read they are serving at the bar from 11pm-2am.  Momofuku, you did not disappoint and I can't wait to try that chicken sandwich!  Edit July 2017: I went back to Momofuku recently and had their spicy chicken sandwich which was spicy and tasty! I also had their Seven Spice Slushie which also had a bit of a spicy kick to it and was good.  Those are on the bar menu from 3-5:30pm and 11pm-12am, 1am on weekends.",

    "text": "A BIG FAT YES.   Dinner was so good it got our homebody friend who rarely leaves his home state talking about making a group trip to NYC. Legit, this food blew his damn mind and gave him courage and a taste for adventure.  Momofuku done right will give you something you don't usually get from most other restaurants: a spiritually-authentic Asian dining experience. It's elevated pan-Asian cuisine that feels like it was made for a huge celebration with family.    You can taste the love chef David Chang has for his mom's cooking, for big dinners with extended families and the family friends you'd call Auntie and Uncle, and for Asian food. These are flavors you only get if you go local and you happen upon someone who learned how to pickle from grandma or a street vendor who came up with a sauce so crackalicious there's a line to his cart before he opens. This is the real deal, folks. I'm Chinese-American - the 'Fuke is the only restaurant I've ever wanted to take my parents to bc it's that freaking good. This place takes me back to my mom's kitchen, night markets, and grandma's table. If you are Asian or love Asian food, you owe it to yourself eat here.   To maximize your 'Fuke experience, go all-in on family dining. Grab a few good friends and make a reservation. Get a round of cocktails to open the stomach, as we say in Chinese. Order off the large format menu, which features main dishes with accompaniments, add a few buns (pork belly is a must), and any other items that strike your fancy.   Hot Tip: aim for a variety of textures and flavors. This is the key to crafting a solid experience at any Asian restaurant.  These dishes are meant for sharing so you and your mates can collectively roll your eyes back in your head as the expletives tumble forth rapturously: \"holy f***, this sh** is so f******* good, mother of god,\" etc.   At least, that's what our group sounded like. Here's what the four of us ordered:   1.) Sichuan Lamb Ribs - Yo, this lamb fell right off the bone and just melted in the mouth. No exaggeration. Get it.  2.) Spicy Rice Cakes - Rice cakes are crackalicious already but these had a crispy outside from being pan fried - so good my bf scraped the rest of the sausage at the bottom of the bowl onto his plate bc he couldn't bear to waste it.  3.) Pork Belly Bun - It's fatty, caramelized, and generous, exactly how pork belly should be. The steamed bun has a silky, luxurious texture. Best bun I've ever had - so good I wish my bun-making grandma was still around so I could treat her.  4.) Bo Ssam, half order - this is a large-format order: a big cut of pork shoulder marinated and slow-cooked to the point where it falls apart at the slightest touch. Accompaniments include bibb lettuce, rice, kimchi, raw oysters, hoisin, ssam sauce, and ginger scallion oil. You take your lettuce and fill it with whatever you like (and there are tons of flavor and texture permutations!) and eat it.   Dude, this bo ssam. THIS BO SSAM. The meat was so good it got two of us re-thinking our laziness in the kitchen bc we knew we needed to learn to slow-cook pork shoulder like this. That's right, it made me want to put more effort into cooking. What sorcery is this!? The kimchi was fermented but still tasted super fresh and clean. My dudes, even the rice was perfectly cooked. It stuck together but stayed fluffy. Our server tipped us off to stuffing the fillings into some steamed buns and brought out four for us. DO IT. Hell, order two plates of steamed buns. You will die and go to foodie heaven, which totally exists.  It's a great deal. We stuffed ourselves silly and still rolled out w a bag of leftovers.   If you are dining with two, get a few plates to share and again, aim for a variety of flavors and textures (your server can help you with this).   If you're solo or there late at night, pony up to the noodle bar for ramen and buns. It's cozy and warm and no one will bother you if you just want to look down and shovel noodles into your drunk face - exactly how late-night noodles should be.   The staff is the coolest, friendliest bunch you'll meet on the Strip. They welcome you like family. Each time I've come here, I've had great convos with my servers, bartenders, and cooks. They give fantastic recommendations bc they like good food, too.   We stop in every time we're in Vegas. This food can inspire you to eat more meaningfully, connect more deeply, live more fully. I've seen it happen.",

    "text": "Service:  I went to Momofuku by myself for lunch on a Thursday.  Edgar (host) and Chris (waiter) served me and were very friendly.  Chris was very knowledgeable of the menu and gave an overview of everything.  Edgar was very personable and very enthusiastic about the food here; He made my experience that more enjoyable. I think because I was by myself they both made a habit to check up on me often, which I didn't mind as their company was engaging and delightful.   Food:  I had pork belly bun and spicy cucumbers.  The pork belly bun came first and was really good with their spicy korean sauce. The pork belly had just enough fat in it and was cooked nicely. The sauce of the pork belly was sweet enough to balance out the savoriness of the pork belly. The sliced cucumbers offered a crunchy alternate texture. The bun was steamed and soft, as it should be. They provided a korean spicy sauce (which wasn't all that spicy) that paired REALLY well with the pork belly. Their korean spicy sauce was diverse and in my opinion would pair well with almost anything.  The spicy cucumbers were seasoned with togarashi and came with whole toasted almonds. Togarashi is a Japanese chili spice blend. I have a low spice tolerance, so this had plenty of kick. I like how they kept the almonds whole because biting into a whole almonds created a nutty taste that neutralized the spiciness of the togarashi. The cucumbers where whole and chunky, which gave and nice crunch. Even though this was listed under the small plates section of their menu I would highly recommend sharing this dish with a party rather than eating the whole thing by yourself like I did. I was able to finish the dish, but I had no more room to explore the rest of the menu.  Final comments:  The service here was amazing and the food was a refreshing Asian American fusion. I'll definitely be back here again, hopefully to try some of the larger plates with my friends.",

The pork ramen also has a huge piece of pork which is very delicious!!   We had reservations for a group of 8 at 1:30pm on a Sunday, but the restaurant wasn't super busy during our whole time there. The staff was very helpful and friendly, and they were also able to split our bill per order which was very convenient.  The ramen was a little pricey though for ramen (~$17 + $3 for adding bok choy), and it's all I had, but I definitely want to come back and try the pork buns too!   After lunch, make sure you stop by the bakery for the amazing cookies (the chocolate one is my favorite!!!) and desserts!",

    "text": "This is my second time being here, and it was just as delicious as the first   We decided to grab a quick bite before going ice skating. We ended up ordering one of each of their steamed buns, crispy potatoes, pork ramen, and crispy rice cakes. All of our dishes were extremely delicious!  The buns themselves deserve 5 stars. The we're steamed to perfection. The four flavors of buns were: shrimp, unagi, shiitake, and pork belly. And the server gave us a little spicy sauce thing on the side which made an already delicious bun even more tasty! My boyfriends favorite the shrimp because it was perfectly crispy and very flavorful and it was quite filling in size. I fell in love with the unagi. It had a perfect balance of salt and flavor and crisp. Just amazing. But don't let that stop you from ordering the other two because they were all very very good and hard to choose what I liked best.   Then the ramen came out. The shredded pork and the pork belly were amazing! If only all ramen places had pork like theirs.. haha. The noodles were cooked al dente, which is surprising because usually they get soggy. And the broth was light and seasoned :)  The crispy potatoes and crispy rice cakes came out shortly after and while we wanted to indulge in more greatness, we were unfortunately too full from everything else. But the little bites we were able to squeeze in were amazing! The crispy potatoes flavors crept in slowly but it all went together very well. And the rice cake dish had so much zest! It wasn't overwhelmingly spicy, which was a huge plus, and each little rice cake was crispy and chewy and just lovely.  Oh! I forgot! We also ordered their sparkling sake, and it really blew our minds. I always order the cheap hot or cold sake from usual Asian places, but this one didn't taste like sake at all. It has truly sparked my interest in sake.  The food quality is so delicious and while the menu isn't very extensive, I'd rather choose from a few amazing dishes then a mixture of 3 Star dishes. The service was attentive, friendly and welcoming. Can't wait to go back!",

It has a lot of flavor and quite a kick! There is definitely a kick in the dish with the jalapeno slices in there. At first when the bowl comes out you think it's too small of a portion but it has carbs, proteins, and some kick that I felt really content and full. The shrimp bun was interesting but good. After your spicy meal, it is a must to hit next door to Milk and get that ice cream! It seriously makes the meal so complete! I never had that ice cream until this recent trip and it seriously made the meal end all the more better. Yummy!!",

We had the jidori chicken which came out sort of burnt and dry. The five spice duck however was delicious! Next item we had the pork and shrimp baos, nothing out of the normal quite ordinary in my opinion I've definitely had better elsewhere. We also had the Brussels sprouts, I know that Brussels sprout can be quite bitter but the Brussels sprouts here were extremely bitter, even the tart and tangy flavors couldn't offset it. We also had the chickpea ramen, very rich but the flavoring was alittle off. Maybe my expectations were alittle too high. Server were nice and friendly and greeted us within five mins of sitting down.",

From that moment on, I have always appreciated his philosophy about food (Haute, street, and whatnot). After years of following his career, I finally had the opportunity to eat at one of his restaurants. As some cybernauts might exclaim, OMG!   On an insanely-hot August day, It was at Momofuku Las Vegas that I expected to have the meal of a lifetime and finally reconcile the philosophy of the chef with the acclaimed dishes.   The dimly lit space is certainly chic and expertly decorated. Chill beats set the soundtrack to your meal as well as the innumerable conversations of the young and hip crowd, which tends to overflow out of the restaurant in long-wavy lines. As far as trendy places goes, this is pretty much the place to be.   Now, on to the three stars. The fact is, as beautiful as the place is, there was nothing remarkable about the food. The restaurant serves inviting dishes, but they are not memorable or worthy of double and triple-digit prices. The five spice rubs cannot mask the lack of essence or the feeling that this is really a massive kitchen serving a massive crowd.   What did I expect before visiting this restaurant? I expected levels of flavors and fusion that could only be found in this restaurant. I expected the best of Asian comfort food (or versions of) brought to the table through numerous small plates that emphasized the diversity of the continent's cuisine. I expected a real tribute to Korea and Mr Chang's background. Unfortunately, I did not find any of these elements in my choices. Hopefully, other patrons had better luck. I wish this restaurant the best and hopefully, I'll have a better experience on my next try.",

    "text": "Momofuku Las Vegas is located inside the Cosmopolitan hotel, one of many restaurants inside this beautifully thought out hotel. This was our first stop in Las Vegas, after waiting a few years to visit this amazing city!   My significant other and I came to this restaurant after being recommended to us by our guest service agent. She told us that we'd enjoy it very much, especially since it our first time in Las Vegas. The service given to us was fine. We were approached by our server who seated us immediately. We asked her for popular dishes on the menu. From those recommendations, we decided to order the pork belly and shrimp baos, spicy cucumbers, crispy potatoes, and for our main dish the 5 spice rotisserie duck (which was supposed to be the highlighted dish on the menu). While my significant other has never eaten duck, she decided to be particularly courageous this time, since we're in Las Vegas! I was happy because I love duck.   When we got our food, everything turned out to be pretty tasty, except the duck. One bite of the duck meat and all you can taste is a distinct saltiness. One bite of the rice (which came with the duck) was all salt as well. I could understand if the duck was a bit on the salty side, accompanied by rice that is not, so that way it helps balance the other, but clearly this wasn't the case.   So we spoke to our waiter and she took the duck back. She told us that she would come back and ask us if we'd like another duck dish prepared. Instead, she came back to our table to let us know they've already put one on the fire and that it's being made immediately. At this point, we felt like we had no choice but to keep the duck even though my significant other and I both decided that we no longer wanted it. It was upsetting that we were not asked if we wanted another dish prepared before our server let the chef know to fire up another one. By the time we had the chance to tell our server, it was already too late and she came back with another duck in her hand.   So here is another attempt at the duck... this one was still salty but not as salty as the first. Rice is still pretty salty as well. We each had one bite and decided we're just going to bring it \"to-go,\" even though we knew we couldn't eat it because it's salty, and secondly, there was no microwave in the hotel to heat it up again. We paid for the bill and left a 20% tip despite us not being happy with our first meal of the day, even though we were starving!!  I get to our room and opened up the duck to take a look at it inside. We found a surprise waiting for us -  a fruit fly on the lettuce, packed to-go. We may not have left the restaurant starving, but we were not satisfied. I don't think we'll be coming back to this restaurant the next time we find ourselves in Vegas. For the experience to begin so well in the beginning and then shot all the way down was saddening. I really wanted a pleasant experience",

    "text": "I've heard so much about the New York Momofuku that when I found out they opened one on Vegas, I had to go! We ordered the shishito peppers, pork belly buns, slow roasted pork shoulder ssams, and pork ramen.   Shishito peppers - Very good. Not too spicy. The ones on the bottom of the bowl had a lot more lime flavor Pork belly buns - I judge pork belly buns by the amount of fat on them. These were great! Nice and fatty. If you don't like fatty foods then definitely avoid these.  Slow roasted pork shoulder ssams - We were warned that the pork shoulder tends to be very \"saucy\" and is more sweet than savory. So we asked for it to be less saucy and it came out great. Their kimchi is great as well. Not too strong. Normally with lettuce wraps, you have to limit your meat per wrap, but at Momofuku, you have to overstuff your lettuce with meat! Pork ramen - It came with two types of pork. One that's more of a chasu and one that's more like the shoulder in the ssams. The slow poached egg was amazing especially if you are an egg lover!   Overall, the restaurant is kind of pricey. Walked out with about an $85 bill including tip but the food quality was worth it!",

We went on its grand opening weekend and got seated at the counter without a reservation. And David Chang was right in front of us, cooking a fish stew. He was super friendly and offered everyone at the counter a bowl to taste, and joked around With the guests and his chefs. We were able to watch the chefs doing their magic in the kitchen-they kept it fun and casual, but at the same time, extremely efficient and productive. That is always a good indication of a great restaurant!  The food definitely lived up to the hype. The ingredients were simple, but the layers of flavors were massive.   My boyfriend's favorite was the shiitake bun-just enough firmness of the shiitake grilled to perfection that captured its flavor and juiciness. Mine is the Mussels and the chickpea ramen. The mussels were served with smoked Bacon bits and I would never thought of smokiness and mussels would go so well together! Chickpea ramen - completely opposite of what I thought it would taste like. Not gonna ruin the surprise, just order one and try it yourself!  I'm browsing through other Yelpers' photos and looks like there is a huge portion of the menu left to be explored for us. Definitely will come back!",

We watched the team prepare the dishes and it was fun to see the variety of dishes they were preparing.   We had the spicy cucumbers, pork belly bun, spicy noodles, and the fried lobster and shrimp. The spicy noodles were a favorite. The spice of the sausage contrasted nicely with the noodles and I could have easily eaten another bowl of these and skipped the lobster and shrimp. The cucumber dish was the perfect accompaniment to our other dishes, providing a refreshing contrast. The pork belly bun is worth a try, but not a personal favorite.   The lobster and shrimp was good, but for me was too filling and like I said, I would have been happy with more noodles.   Additionally we enjoyed the cocktails (the Spring Fling was delicious) and wine. Also a plus for my husband was the in house sparkling water. Attentive and efficient service made our dining experience memorable.",

Definitely open up my appetite.   Hawaiian Kampachi:  The fish was very fresh, almost melted in your mouth with a just enough ponzu kick to it.  Shishito Peppers:  it was a busy the night we were in, the waiter thought we waited too long for our dishes, which we didn't really...he was nice enough to accommodate the Peppers to us for free while we were waiting.  It's a bit salty, great snack dish when you have a big party   Shoyu Pork Ramen:  BEST IN TOWN !  The Chasyu Pork Belly was season and grill perfectly with the right portion.  Noodle was just in the cook in the perfect texture.  They also have some pull pork in there.  The SOUP was just epic !   5 Spices Roasted Duck: Never Tasted anything like this before !!!!

So we got to try a good portion of the menu on the night we were there.   Standouts were the pork buns- these live up to the hype! The pork belly is soft but crispy and caramelized on the outside.  Our neighbors passed us a bottle of ssam sauce to add to the bao and that was good advice! Other favorites were the striped bass crudo, which was fresh and light, the buttery miso sea bass, and the sweet & sour long beans. Also, the yuzu lemonade was delicious.  Overall, though, we felt like the menu is a bit uneven- the dishes we didn't care for we *really* didn't enjoy, i.e. the ginger-scallion noodles sounded like they would be a good side dish with flavors complimentary to the other dishes but in reality they were quite spicy, bitter, and salty- they were too much, and although they barely got touched, nobody wanted to take them home. Similarly, the sweet potatoes with horseradish creme fraiche were fried cubes of potato with a strong horseradish sauce drizzled on top- another dish that sounded good but didn't work for us, barely got touched, and nobody wanted to bring the leftovers home.",

For 4 people, we ordered:  Shisito Peppers - good but heavy on the oil, and some of the peppers were spicy which is unusual but the server said it was due to it being near the end of the season for peppers  Roasted Corn - comes with melted cheese on the side. This was delicious but very greasy.   Grilled Asparagus - also greasy - standard - nothing to report here.  Steamed Branzino - the belle of the ball.  This was the best dish of the meal. Good amount of meat on the fish and flaked off perfectly.  The flavor was infused throughout.    Jidori Chicken - I was so looking forward to this dish because I love jidori chicken, but it was disgusting. I think that the jidori chicken was possibly steamed or baked - not sure.  The rub on it was terrible.  I felt like I was eating a cajun/creole dish.  Not what I was expecting.  Also, the texture of the jidori chicken was rubbbbbbbbbery and not soft.  It makes me gag to think about it still. The portion says it is for 2 people, but it easily fed 4 of us in my party.  Ginger Scallion Noodles - this is a strongly flavored dish.  Seeing as how I am Korean, I love the flavors of both ginger and scallions so I am not sure where this dish went wrong.  The flavoring they added to the ginger and scallions were so pungent and not in a good way.  I ended up eating just the noodles without the fix-ins on top.  Again, another oily dish.  Pork Belly Buns - very fatty and very little meat and greasy.  Shrimp Buns - not actual shrimp, but a shrimp meatball-like square patty.  This was okay - I wouldn't order it again.  Birthday Cake - $14 a slice - jeez louise. This cake was just very confusing. The first bite punches you in the face with such intense sweetness that you will be completely satisfied with one or two bites.  Shouldn't a cake that is so satisfying make you want to eat more? It didn't.  This cake should instead be called Ironic Cake.  I would recommend coming here for lunch since dinner prices are $$$.  Location: Cosmopolitan, to the right of Milk, 2nd floor",

    "text": "We had reservations here for a late brunch on Sunday and they were very busy. But they seated us and we were taken to the back. We were seated at a round table with the food spinner in the middle. I ordered the yuzu lemonade ($9) which was a very citrus ginger lemonade. I didn't enjoy it as much since it was overly sour. Then we got the sweet and sour long beans ($14). The long beans were good, but when brought out, it was already cold. Then we got the pork buns which was good with the secret sauce. The pork could have been crispier but it was just cooked alright.   Then I got the shoyu pork ramen ($17) and the bf got the duck confit fried rice ($34). My friends got the chickpea ramen and the bo saam rice bowl. The ramen was good, a bit on the saltier side though. I have definitely had better ramen elsewhere. I usually like corn with my ramen but they didn't have that option.  The portion was a bit small...looked like a kids bowl. The duck confit fried rice was nothing like we thought it would be. The rice was cooked so unevenly that some rice was lumped together and was hard as rock. The duck didn't taste like duck and the whole dish was smothered with pickled ginger. The taste was not bearable at all. We actually tried looking for the reviews on the fried rice but didn't see anything. As we were leaving, we saw a handful of people order the duck confit fried rice and they were all untouched...now we know why! The dish was horrible! Small portioned too!   My friends said their dishes were alright as well... not the greatest. And the server forgot our drinks until the very end of our meal and they comped us for the drinks. The server was nice but I think she was so busy running around that she didn't really tend to us as much. Overall, the food was not that great. The service was alright. The place is overhyped and it definitely is Asian fusion inspired food.",

Positive aspects the waiters were very nice and friendly, frequent check-ins, the drinks better than the food really made well kudos to mixologist and the atmosphere was lively and loud but not overpowering you can hear your conversation. Also some really cool abstract art from an artist based in LA. I would say bonus the restaurant is next door to MILk so you can step out have some comforting dessert to make up for the unsatisfying meal. Remember this is just my opinion based of one night please go for yourself rate your experience. Enjoy!",

We ordered quite a few different dishes and there were certainly some items that really outshined others. The pork bao buns are truly what legends are made of! The pear burrata salad was also killer. And the rack of lamb was out of this world! Also, if you go, you have to try the yuzu lemonade! I lay awake at night thinking of it to this day.

We came here on a weekday so there was no wait, but it definitely gets packed on the weekends so I would recommend making a reservation.  We ordered the pork belly & shrimp bao, garlic scallion noodles, grilled asparagus, and grilled lamb ribs. Everything was SO good but the lamb was one of the most amazing things I've had. Seriously. The meat was flavorful/tender and came with picketed cucumbers for a nice crunch. They also have some family style dishes which would be perfect for large parties.   The pricing is $$$$ but I think the flavors and ambience are definitely worth the splurge. When in Vegas....",

We walked downstairs and into Momofuku.  Once seated was served by Hadley.  Let me tell you, aside from an awesome beard + stache, he provided excellent service.  The food was delicious and reasonably priced for where we were.  The Shoyu Pork Ramen was delicious and completely saved me.

    "text": "I really have a love hate relationship with Momofuku. I think it really depends on what is on the menu at the time that I visit because we loved the location in DC when we visited, we were ok with La Peche in NYC and now we are ok with the one here in Vegas. We would never turn down another visit to Momofuku but the dishes we had tonight were just not hitting it but with one clear exception. Let me tell you what we got.  First off, Momofuku is located on the second floor of the Cosmopolitan, one of the hotels in the City Center area of Las Vegas strip. It's better for you to Uber there than to park because I imagine parking is really challenging. We booked our dinner about a week in advance, the night of the football championships. To be quite honest, most of the items on the menu seem quite delicious but some of them didn't live up to their description when you actually ate it.  Let's start with the stars of the evening. The Uni Hashbrown is a must. Unbelievable dish that only David Chang can dream of and make. You get a perfectly cooked crunchy flavorful has on the bottom and topped with only the freshest most delicate Santa Barbara uni you can find. The mix together was unbelievable and a True work of texture art. The pork belly buns were also delicious and worthy of praise. My only critique is that the pork was hard to eat given its size relative to the size of the bun which normally wouldn't be a bad thing. However when you took a bite, the entire piece of pork went with it leaving the bun behind.   Then we dove into the main dishes and tonight we had the miso black cod and the black truffle ramen. The miso black cod was good in theory but the cod was WAY too sweet. It was almost like eating a glazed piece of candied fish. Cod I think is sweet on its own and it really could have used something savory to cut that a bit. I will say though that the vegetable broth was excellent. We then had the black truffle ramen which is MP ($50 for us that night). It is exactly what it says: black truffles on top of ramen. I love truffles and I love ramen but what makes ramen so awesome are all the other things that go into it: textures from vegetables, flavor from meats (omg, I salivate just thinking about it). But this dish although simple and good on the surface was really missing a depth to it. It needed more... of something else. The truffle was nice and I like the type of noodles they chose but I either needed a meat protein or more vegetables to complement the rest of the dish. IMHO not worth the price unfortunately.  I saw many other tables getting the family style dishes including the salt and pepper lobster and shrimp. Retrospectively, one of those dishes might have been the way to go. Again, I'd give this place a try again because I really truly believe that a lot of the dishes are either hit or miss. There were a lot of misses but there were some superstars as well. And if you happen to have left some room for dessert, Milk Bar with its full menu, is next door. Get yourself some cereal milk ice cream.",

    "text": "You know this place is good when you are in Vegas for 3 days and came here for dinner two days in a row. Me and my boyfriend were staying at the Cosmopolitan so we thought we'd try this place out since it is located in the hotel. And damn, this place is so good! Even though I was definitely shocked at the high price, there are still \"more affordable\" options on the menu, but do prepare to drop some cash here if you plan to come here.   We tried a couple items on the menu out of our two visits. For cold plates, the Kampachi and Bigeye Tuna are both amazing. The Bigeye Tuna has a wonderful flavor, and the addition of shaved foie gras made it even better. However, the portion is very small and there are lots of strawberry disguised as tuna.   We also tried the brussel sprouts and creamed corn, but are really good. The creamed corn is very creamy, especially with the pesto so it would be nice to have something light to compliment it. The pork belly bun is also a must try; the pork belly is braised perfectly and melts in your mouth. We also got the pork shoyu ramen both times we went as it was a filling yet affordable option. I wouldn't say the ramen is amazing, but it is definitely good and simple, and definitely cures your hangover from partying.   The only thing that I didn't like and would not recommend getting is the spicy cucumber. We thought it would be refreshing, but the spicy oil and peanuts just didn't work together for us. The cucumber were cut in big chunks and just didn't have much taste.   Overall, I had a wonderful experience here and would definitely come back again next time I'm in Vegas.",

Momofuku easily one of the best and trendy spots in Vegas to grub and have some cocktails. The place is attractively furnished, yet still feels homey. They have a special back room for larger/special parties with nice red lighting and soft velvet seating. Shout out to my BF for sweet talking the host and getting us seated there Prices are relatively modest, especially given the quality and location (duh Vegas)  Had a super dope time celebrating my bday, thanks to our super cool server Mags.  Very knowledgeable, attentive, and had jokes for days! Thanks for hooking me up with that sau-sau sauce, just what I needed for that deep fried duck carcass. Super sarap!  And to David Chang, you doin it, doin it, doin it well! Props!",

    "text": "Momofuku is the brainchild of Chef David Chang; the name, an indirect nod to Momofuku Ando, the inventor of instant ramen.  You may also know him from \"The Mind of a Chef\" (host) and \"Ugly Delicious\" (creator/producer).  My husband is a big fan and I felt *slightly* guilty partaking in this meal without him, but carpe diem.  I wasn't about to pass up the chance.  This location is in the Cosmopolitan hotel and we wandered in late one morning on Labor Day.  We had no reservations, but there were many seats available and were seated right away.  The lunch menu offered a fair amount of selections from the raw bar, to small plates, to noodles and rice, etc.  Now... you are on the strip, in a hotel, & it's David Chang, so higher prices are to be expected.   I was most excited to try the pork belly buns.  Their popularity today all started at Momofuku and has inspired countless imitators since then.  We got 3 orders of it fittingly.  I also had to try their noodles (their original location a Noodle Bar) and ordered the shoyu pork ramen and added pork belly (you cannot have too much pork belly).  The pork belly buns were simple in presentation, but the fluffy, chewy white bun, slightly charred slab of pork belly, hoisin, cucumber, & scallion come together to create a symphony of well balanced flavors.  The noodles were the perfect thickness, cooked slightly al dente, and marinated in a pool of rich, smokey, flavorful broth.  The poached egg adds an additional layer of flavor and slightly thickens the broth.  The shredded pork and pork belly delighted my little carnivorous heart.  I thoroughly enjoyed both dishes.  My family also ordered the Bo Ssam Bowl and raved about how absolutely delicious it was.  So why the 4 stars?  My ramen was not piping hot.  It was somewhat warmer than lukewarm.  The service from the waiter also felt impersonal and he didn't ask if we wanted dessert like he asked the table next to us just 5 minutes prior.  I love dessert and would have liked to see the menu, but ah well, Milk Bar was just next door.  All in all, I would still recommend a stop here as the food is what shines and the space provides a versatile ambiance for whatever mood you may be in from the more casual/bar space upon walking in, to the hectic open kitchen, or the more chill, formal dining room with views of the strip.",

This combo leaves you with fatty goodness, sweet and tart flavors in your mouth.  Crispy sweet potatoes remind me of open face baked potato but crispy with horseradish fraiche, garlic and chives. Loved the crispy bits and edges served in a cast iron skillet.   I've always loved David Chang's cocktail menu. The Persephone Punch is a great summer drink. The combo of vodka, pomegranate, date, and cassia is a tasty drink that can leave you a bit tipsy after a few.  I'll definitely have to come back for dinner the next time I'm in town.   Service was great and not a bad price point for notable restaurant.",

Also got the Sichuan noodles, creamed corn, and wagyu short rib stew.  Pork buns are 5/5. Best item here. Nicely cooked and flavorful pork. Hoisin sauce on the buns. Cilantro. Yum.   Sichuan noodles: 2/5 nah pass on this. I saw another review saying this was the best item but seriously ... it was like eating spaghetti & noodles with tomato sauce and some red vinegar.   Creamed corn: 4/5 stars. So delicious. I am not a big fan of corn but I'm not exactly sure how they did this, or made it lol. I thought it was like cheese corn (the stuff u get at kbbq) but it's not. Very similar but it's not. Big bowl. I ate a bunch of it. Delicious !!  Wagyu short rib stew: 2.5/5 nah!!! Lol I'd pass on this. Nothing special. Seriously... we didn't even finish it lol   I think they're known for their ramen or something. Not sure. Lots of hype about this place but eh wasn't up to par to what I've had in SoCal.   Anyway, worth the experience but I wouldn't come back. Way way way overpriced for what you get.",

It's loud and crowded with beautiful people.  The decor is on point: Classy, contemporary, cool art murals, dim lighting and great views of the strip via the glass walls looking out.  Our server was a lot of fun and great with recommendations of all the dishes.  Water glasses were never empty and neither were the cocktails.    Momofuku Cuisine: The pork belly buns are the tastiest on the strip.  I came for the Shoyu Pork Ramen and I was glad it made it to the table even though it's not on the dinner menu.  The broth was very savory and rich with flavor.  Noodles were fresh and I loved the poached egg dropped in the middle.  The Sichuan beef noodles was a spicy tasty plate with fresh af noodles.  The Miso sea bass was delicious and a table favorite.   Overall, all the dishes were small in serving size but massive in flavor.  This is to be expected when you add a celebrity chef + gorgeous resto + prime location in a resort on the Vegas Strip.  You're here for the overall experience and Momofuku provides a great one with yummy dishes, good service and a social media friendly attractive dining area.  Enjoy!",

    "text": "I first heard of this place about a little over a year ago when I was watching season one of Chef's Table on Netflix and learned that this is where the famous pastry chef, Christina Tosi, started out. I'm a sucker for great food. I made it my mission to try this place. But upon two missed opportunities in LA and Toronto because I couldn't get reservations, imagine my surprise to find out that I could just walk right into the restaurant in Vegas with no wait!   Located inside the Cosmo, this place is located right next door to Tosi's Milk Bar. I came in with a group of five other people. The front of the store looks like there isn't a lot of seating, but there is a back area with tables to fit bigger groups. When we got there, it was around 11am and my group was the only one in the back area. Our server brought us our menus right way and explained it to us since we were all first timers.  We decided on 3 orders of pork belly buns. One order comes with two buns. Somehow the server convinced us to get the bo ssam in large format, which serves 4-6 people for a total of $180. Go big or go home, right? Especially fitting since we were in Vegas. For those of you who don't know what bo ssam is, it's pretty much a DIY lettuce wrap with some sort of meat, sauce, and garnish. This version came with pork shoulder, rice, lettuce, kimchi, oyster sauce, ssam (spicy) sauce, and scallions. There were also oysters included which I thought was a nice touch.   - Pork Belly Buns: The came served peking duck style! steamed bun stuffed with pork belly and scallions and oyster sauce for garnish. This was probably the best thing I had from there. The pork belly was very tender and easy to eat because it fell apart in your mouth.   - Bo Ssam: The pork shoulder came as a big slab of meat in a bowl covered with sauce. We shredded it ourselves very easily and began to use the lettuce as our medium for wraps. The kimchi came in a side dish that wasn't big enough for six people so we to constantly ask for more. The rice also wasn't enough for six people so we asked for a second bowl. The pork shoulder was definitely enough for six people and again was very tender.  However, the sauce was overwhelming and that's all we could taste. So we didn't finish all of the meat. The oysters were also very small, but shucked well.   Our group decided that they wanted to try the ramen, since Momofuku is known as a noodle bar firstly. We ordered the shoyu pork ramen, which came with you guessed it: more pork! Specifically pork belly and pork shoulder. The ramen noodles were thick and cooked perfectly. Broth was light and did not have a very strong soy sauce flavor, which I thought was nice. Lastly, there was a poached egg that was cooked perfectly as well.   Overall, a great experience for being a first timer. Food was delicious but serving suggestions were a little off for the bo ssam and service started to decline as the restaurant got very busy during the lunch rush. Had trouble even flagging people down since they didn't even glance in our direction. I would come back and try their other items!",

Overall, I'm not super impressed. The best thing was the pork belly bun. Otherwise, me and my girls were in consensus that everything else was salty.   Interior: Located in the Cosmopolitan. Large with a beautiful mural on the back wall.  Service: Nice and accommodating. The waitress gave us her real opinion on the famous birthday cake, and she said to pass on that. Thank you for being a real one!  Food: Pricey and salty -Pork Belly Bun ($14): comes with 2 per order with hoisin, scallion, and cucumber. These were our favorites. The pork was crispy coated with a delicious sauce. They weren't too small either.     -Ramen: the ramen was off menu, oddly. We had to ask for it. We tried it out, and agreed it was too salty, but still edible.   Drinks: They have wine, cocktails, and beer - Spritz ($17): if you like fruity like I do, this one was good. It had hibiscus, sake, strawberries, and sparkling rose.   -Whisky Highball ($17): this one was strooong. I didn't really like this one.   These drinks are expensive! Just get a Fat Tuesday :p  Overall, the experience was just alright here, but if you're craving ramen or Asian food, a good go to.",

    "text": "Friendly staff. Nearly everyone greeted us as we walked in (party of 2). Much larger space than how it appears to the outside. Very vibrant and lively (so kind of loud when you're trying to have an intimate conversation).   We went at dinner time and reserved through Open Table, so absolutely no wait. They have two dining options: ramen bar facing kitchen/chefs and the main dining area. For larger parties of about 6-8 I saw they have tables equipped with a lazy Susan in the middle to share the large format menu items.  Ordered the pork belly buns (2), pork ramen (available during dinner--you just have to ask the server), and kampachj (yellowtail poke style dish with lemon sauce yum!).  The buns were a little blanch in terms of sauce, but I love me some sauce! However, the pork belly was so juicy and crispy. Perfect texture! I think the best I've ever had.  The ramen was a bit salty, but still so good and flavorful. Mmm perfectly cooked egg--Instagram worthy breaking yolk! The pork belly in the ramen was phenomenal! Again the best feature of a pork belly I have ever ever had.  The kampachi was raw just FYI, poke style. Drizzled with a sweet/sour lemon. Sauce. The fish texture itself was okay, but the dish made up for it with the amazing sauce and green garnish blend.  Great experience for my first time!",

This last time I went was the first time I ordered a large format item.  Before, I was always a bit afraid to spend so much and be disappointed.  Well, let me assure you, you will not be disappointed.  We got the 5 spice duck and even when I'm full I think about eating this duck again.  The service here is also OUT OF THIS WORLD.  The staff is expertly trained and you want for nothing.  Two examples being, a) the carving and presentation of the duck and b) being given a few samples of wine to choose to pair well with your meal.    So, if you have it spend it and if you don't, come in anyway and get a few apps.  It's worth it.  It really is.",

    "text": "I am conflicted with writing this review.  Huge fan of Momofuku.  Huge fan of David Chang. I love his series of #gracewanted during her pregnancy on IG.  The food looked amazing and made me wish I was having any one of those meal... instead of what I actually had... at Momofuku Las Vegas inside the Cosmo.   Loved: decor, atmosphere, the Cosmo and definitely our waitress. She was amazing!  The Pork Belly Bao and shishito peppers, good starters! Menu is different from the NYC one.  Except the pork belly!   Food: go for the safe bet! Get the braised short rib stew; Korean fusion stew with rice cake & tender short ribs.  The lamb was good - friend had this and she enjoyed it.  2 of my friends and I went with a different choice because on the menu - it spoke to us.  Tomahawk Heritage Porkchop.   We were expecting something juicy, tender and very pork-chop like.  The presentation looked amazing... alas.. we can't feed our hunger on looks.  We took one big bite... and was met with Confusion and Disappointment.  The taste was over-powering... not in a good way.  It tasted like \"smoked ham\"... those holiday ones with the pineapples... it was terrible.  We forced ourselves to eat as much as we can, about 4 pieces in; I felt sick.  Please do not order this... unless you are ok with eating a $50+ honey ham.    Our waitress was just excellent, she asked one of our pork chop to be taken off, because she was very aware that all 3 of us couldn't even finish half our plate.   Overall, I would probably skip on my next trip to Vegas... cuz, if I want Korean (the only thing tasty was the stew), I'd hit up off the strip goodies.",

We were told to wait a few minutes for them to clear the table, which was fine. 30 minutes and 4 check-ins later we were finally walked to our table. To make matters worse the hostesses weren't even apologetic, there was no communication. We were expected to just stand there and wait forever - not cool.  We expressed our dissatisfaction to our waiter who apologized several times and turned everything around from that point on. Brought us wine and two dishes on the house. Thankfully they redeemed themselves because we were looking forward to dining here.  I was truly wowed with the decor, the ambiance and the food. They are known for their American and Asian fusion dishes; everything we tried was really incredible. The flavors were rich and unique. Our waiter explained their menu is set up family style, we decided to order a few dishes and share.  Favorites: Spicy Cucumbers, Brussels Sprouts and Cauliflower (my favorite,) Ginger Scallion Noodles and Sichuan Beef Noodles.   5 stars for the amazing food, ambiance and service. Knocking off one star for the hostesses, who clearly need more training in properly communicating with customers.",

    "text": "With a party of 6 after 5pm on a Friday summer, we were seated immediately. Unsure of what to order, our great waiter recommended a tasting menu ranging from $75-$200. My bougie friend of course, picked the $200 per person option, something I would never do, but it was Vegas and we are fans of David Chang!  We started with spicy cucumbers and shishito peppers. After we had the big eye tuna which had strawberries, but for us they also added amazing black caviar. The extreme saltiness from the black caviar, the fish of the tuna, and the sweetness of the strawberries was honestly \"flavortown\". They also poured our glasses with some red wine.   We were then given the Salt & Pepper Lobster and Shrimp. There was a lobster tail for each of us, and it was the best lobster and shrimp I've ever had in my life, because most of the lobster I've eaten is cold. This giant dish was crispy, savory, and the lobster felt like butter melting in your mouth. I think out of the entire tasting menu, I'd come back and would be willing to order THIS dish on it's own. We were also poured some sake.  For the last 2 dishes I don't believe they were on the regular menu. We started with some white truffle ramen followed by a giant tomahawk style steak (see attached photos taken by meow_eats , whom was present). The giant steak was brought out by someone else and placed on our table so we could take photos, he then placed it on a cart behind our table and sliced it for us. The chef then came out from behind the kitchen and thanked us for enabling him to cook this steak.   After this main dinner, our waiter grabbed us some dessert items from next door and served us some coffee, espresso, and milk if we wanted. We were served crack pie, birthday cake, icecream, and truffles to share. All and all this tasting menu option was one of the best restaurant experiences I've ever had in my life (but again I don't normally do something like this). I highly recommend Momofuku as an Asian American, fan of David Chang, and Vegas visitor!",

From Oyster Bar's pan roast to Shang Artisan Hand pulled noodles, we wanted to cap the night with the acclaimed Momofuku.  We didn't make any reservations and was seated right away. Yay. Everything was meh after that. Servers kept on changing we didn't even know which one was our server, but perhaps all of them wanted to keep us happy, i dunno.   We started with some hamachi thing, which was pretty good. Citrus, sweet to cut the fishiness, fresh fish..it was good, but nothing special I couldn't get at my neighborhood (Chicago) sushi spot though. So, 3.5/5  Then we had the Szechuan Beef Noodle, it had some ground beef in it, tasted heavy, had some spice, but was missing a few flavor notes. It was very bland. So bland i asked for salt. (Which i cant even remember the last time i ever asked for salt) i just had to in order to be able to eat the noodles. It did taste better w some salt, but still lacking. I give it a 2/5.  Im glad we didn't order all at once. Decided to add on as we tried a few things instead. Since the noodles weren't good, we decided to forego the wagyu short rib stew and try the creamed corn. Delicious. 4/5 for the creamed corn.   All in all, id say the best thing we had was creamed corn? We stopped there bc it was just not worth it. For my asian palette, all the asian dishes were bland. Maybe it tailored that way?   Im glad i gave it a shot. Fancy and expensive doesn't mean good  A good reminder to manage my expectations.",

Both times the service was friendly and attentive, and the food was delicious. There are many exceptional items to choose from; you really can't go wrong in choosing from the menu. Don't forget to ask for the daily specials.  A few highlight dishes I enjoyed are as follows.  * Bigeye Tuna with shaved foie gras * The Buns! Pork belly and the shrimp buns are a must! * Chilled Spicy Noodles. A refreshing change from the more popular ramen.  * Spicy Cucumber. Nice starter!  Don't forget to sauce your bites with the Ssam Korean Chili Sauce! Adds a nice burst of flavor to your food.   The dessert menu is excellent too, with some of the options coming from Milk Bar next door. I especially love the cereal milk ice cream and cake truffles. I hope to try the Crack Pie a la mode next visit!  Drink menu looks to have some refreshing house-made cocktails I've yet to try. Hopefully next time!  It's recommended to have reservations since this is a popular spot for many visitors. For bar service, I was able to get a seat right away.  The atmosphere is modern and hip with a chill vibe. Views of the strip are nice day or night.",

It provided a nice salty taste that complimented the char of the peppers.    -Pork Belly Buns  A healthy portion of pork tha was crispy outside and all juice inside. Nice hoison flavor with cucumber and scallion for balance -Sichuan Beef Noodles - My absolute favorite dish. It was similar to the asian version of bolognase. I tasted the 5 spice and it definitely had a bit of a kick from the spices that made my mouth water and also crave more.",

Our server Vanessa took great care of us and gave us insightful recommendations in each menu category - my favorite being the Yuzu limeade (perfect sweetness and tartness)! One of the managers, Ricalynn, checked in on us often and made sure we were well taken care of. All the runners and bussers we interacted with were polite and gracious. The menu has affordable options for the budget-conscious looking to have a special night and \"Ball Out\" options for the large group menu. Our table favorites were the Sauteed Chicken Katsu with mushroom gravy (you'll wonder why you're paying more than $30 for katsu, but trust me, it's perfectly fried and the gravy is like crack) and the soft boiled eggs with salmon roe (a must for the table)! Dessert menu through Milk Bar was solid - the soft serve twist with crack pie AND cereal milk with cornflake crunch and a corn cookie on the side will give you diabetes, but you'll die happy. I've already made a few reservations here for the next 3 months and looking forward to seeing how the staff continues to improve on their rhythm - they already have a great foundation to build upon! Come soon, I'm sure they'll be packed in no time!",

And when i heard there was going to be one in Vegas, I knew nothing could stop me. I only had the lunch ramen and Kimchi on the side... And when you hear chefs talk about how you can taste every flavor and/or ingredient in their dish... Its really True. I don't have an adept palete or even cook well. But I could definitely taste multiple distinct flavors in the ramen and kimchi. It was amazing.",

The location is awesome, a modern, urban-chic yet simple decor inside the Cosmopolitan, with a view on the Planet Hollywood, the Paris and the Bellagio lake. This place was packed, but not too noisy, with a very friendly atmosphere. The staff is super nice, very careful, and can give you some good advice if you're in trouble choosing on the menu. Portions are very decent, great for sharing so you can taste more items! The big eye tuna with shaved foie gras was amazing. This is one of their signature dishes. Buns were very tasteful. The cucumber and almonds salad was one of my favorite picks. Then the amazing roasted chicken, along with... fried bones (yes, fried bones, I mean it!). At first I thought it was a joke, but it really comes with a side of fried bones, that you can actually eat, and even if I was pretty skeptical, well I had to admit this was pretty good. Great casual place to socialize, in the original spirit of the Cosmopolitan.",

    "text": "OK, so it wasn't HORRIBLE, but honestly it wasn't any better than most ramen places I've been to in the bay area, and it was LOT more expensive.  The excellent:  * The buns were awesome. Like best part of the meal awesome. We had the pork belly, and the mushroom buns.  The good * The Smoked egg and salmon egg appetizer (I forget the name). It was reallly good, but kind of mushy. Needed a little more texture to it. You have to like smokey things - My GF didn't like it * The Kimchi chicken, and fried bones - The Kimchi was bomb, really good. The friend bones were delicious - super salty and crispy. The Dark meat chicken was good, but the breast meat was really dry, which kept this from being under the \"excellent\" category.   The not so great: * The Ramen! The pork belly ramen was pretty bland, and unexciting. I was going to order the one with truffles, and such, but I'm glad I didn't because I would have been extra disappointed I think. I've had much better ramen, pretty much everywhere honestly. It wasn't \"bad\", but for the price, and expectations, it really didn't hit the mark.  * I liked the spicy cucumbers, GF didn't... But I didn't like them enough to really elevate this rating much.   Overall I think the two star description of \"Meh. I've experienced better\" fits this restaurant perfectly. Not bad, but just OK, and because of the price, I'd avoid it.",

I said that's fine but you open at 11:00, correct? The other girl replied 11ish. Okay, no biggie we peruse the menu at Milkbar and took some pictures. 11ish has come and gone and the two girls started sitting other patrons. I was hoping that one of them will inform us that they were open. Mind you, we were just to the side of their podium! I really wanted to try this place so at 11:15 I came back to the front and the girl with the glasses acted like she's never seen me before and asked if I had reservations. Uhh, the place only had about three tables filled at this time. She sighed and said let's see what I can do. Gee, thanks.   We were not impressed by the two hostesses in the front and I think that set the stage how we enjoyed (or not) our meal. We ordered: pork belly buns, chicken buns, chicken katsu bowl, four pork ramen bowls, shishito peppers. All dishes were average with pork ramen falling a little below. We ordered items from the Milkbar: marshmallow cookies, cereal milk ice cream, cereal milk and crack pie twist ice cream with crunch, cereal milk and fruit milk twist ice cream, birthday truffles. I was the only one who liked my dessert. The only saving grace of the meal and the reason for the two stars was our server. This restaurant was not worth the $200 lunch.",

We tried:    -pork belly Bun -shrimp Bun -fried brussel sprouts  -pork ramen -chicken noodle soup  The best thing was the fried Brussels sprouts. Pork belly Bun was coo, but it didn't even compare to Chairman Bao truck in SF.

    "text": "One of the best dining experience I ever had! We had reservations at 5:30pm, got seated right when 5:30pm hits. We were seated in their dining area. The best part of dinner was getting to meet Chef David Chang.  The waitress surprised us with complimentary dishes from the chef. Is this real? Pinch me!  Everyone was genuinely kind and attentive. Throughout our dinner, they constantly refilled our water with either flat or sparkling water. All the waiter/waitress were so friendly and easy to talk to (they're funny too lol). They notified us that all the dishes were family-style so we all shared a bit of everything. Menu change daily and open from 5:30pm-10:00pm  1) Pork ramen ($18) - The ramen was chewy, slightly firm, in a light flavorful broth. Good size to share among 2 people. You can request for Japanese chili powder if you like it spicy.  2) Pork belly buns 2pcs ($16) - Must have/try with their house 'ssam sauce'. It gives you the even balance of savory, sweet, spicy with crisp  3) Complimentary dishes from the chef -- Blueeye Tuna covered with shaved foie gras.  This was the highlight of our dinner. The cure fish just melts in your mouth and compliments well the creamy foie gras.  4) Complimentary dishes from the chef -- Fried Chicken and Caviar.  Also another highlight and must try. With every bite of the fried CRISPY chicken, it just kept me igoing for more. Perfectly pairs with the fluffy truffle cream and caviar.   5) 5 spice rotisserie duck ($198) - just on point and it was how I imagine it would be. The flavors just evenly distributed into every single piece of the duck. It is served with confit legs over rice in a clay pot. To eat, you wrap the duck with bibb lettuce, kimchi, and 1 of 3 sauces (hoisin sauce, house 'ssam' sauce, and...) This is worth the try!  It was a pleasure to dine here at Momofuku. We are sincerely blessed with the services along with the complimentary dishes from the chef.",

Couldn't decide if I liked it or not. Oysters were salty. It had bacon and collars greens. Had to take off the top part and eat the oysters by itself. The noodles had various meets and that was decent. Had the fried chicken which was probably the best out of everything. I thought it was fried perfectly. I'd come back to try the noodles.

It was like a Big Mac elevated to heaven where everything works perfectly together   The shrimp bun was also a wow but the shrimp party was way to big for the bun. It was tasty as hell but odd to eat since the shrimp size.   The pork bun was pretty good. Maybe a bit heavy on the hoisin sauce   The ssam sauce was a little tangy and didn't help the buns.  It was good but no need for the buns   Ok now for the just ok The ginger scallion noodles were quite a bit oily and aldente as hell.  We were kinda disappointed about these noodles  The seaweed to me did nothing for the dish. The pickles added a nice crunch but what saved the dish was the mushrooms.  They had a bit of acid that made the dish nice and fresh   I was hoping to pork ramen was going my to blow my mind. It fell short and was really just one note. It had a very porky broth and the park belly was god damn perfect while the shoulder was good. I think the egg beautifully cooked just added to the heaviness of the dish. The bean sprouts didn't impress and just got lost in the dish. Maybe they if they weren't cooked as much it would have added some much needed texture.  I was just hoping for something a little brighter or maybe a bit of acid. Just a couple pieces of kimchi or even a wedge of lime would have put this into the awesome class.   My wife loved the desert but it was really sweet for me.   I'm part Korean so maybe I had higher expectations for a fellow mando eater",

I felt like I was dining like royalty; with mountains of delicious food to eat from. Though it is slightly on the expensive side, I would definitely recommend it. Really, if you have like 6 people to split it with it is not that expensive. Also, expect to be at the restaurant for about two hours if you order the chicken and caviar. So worth it! The service was exceptionally great this time. We had more then one server recommend how to eat the chicken and caviar, which was super helpful because we did not know where to start. I also brought my toddler son this time and the staff was so nice to us and made sure I had plenty to keep him entertained. At one point my son was getting fussy and one of the servers brought out a lid for him to play with. I so appreciated it! Though I will probably not bring my son again, it's nice to know that we are more than welcome to bring him.",

Everything is pretty expensive and totally not worth it. For the total cost of the meal I couldve gotten a nice piece of steak! Here is what I ordered:  Momofuku oysters: 6 oysters covered in buttered bread crumbs. Had absolutely no flavor, not even salt. $21 or $23 (forgot the actual price)  pork belly bao: $7 each, pork was tender, too much hoi sin sauce.  rotisserie chicken and bones: bones were super dry and no flavor, chicken was dry and only had scallions under the skin. Again, only flavor was the scallions. terrible version of the chinese steamed chicken with scallions and ginger. the kimchi is really just cabbage in gochujang sauce. $33  pork ramen: very small bowl, too salty!!! the infamous boiled egg you find in ramen was a badlt poached egg, not worth $18!!  yellowtail: not fresh, smelled fishy which means the fish is not fresh. And again, the sauce was so light it tasted like nothing. needs salt or ponzu or lemon...anything! $18 1 star was for the pork belly bao and tge bartender.",

The Cod Claypot was too sweet, the 'wagyu' ribeye was nothing like wagyu and I'm fairly certain the cut of meat was not ribeye. The pork buns and chicken were actually pretty good, but I feel like I can get better ramen elsewhere. Mussels were good and both types of oysters were decent.   Overpriced and underwhelming would be my take. I did want to like this place more as I'm a huge David Chang fan, but this just didn't do it for me.",

(Maybe I should known by that)  We ordered first pork belly ramen, hamachi, ginger scallion noodle, pork belly bun and unagi bun(it never came, so we cancel it).   The best dish was the pork belly ramen and I think it was only dish I can recommend from all the food I had ordered. The pork belly was soft in the inside and crispy on the outside. The dish for nicely done and favorful.  The scallion noodle consist of green onion and mushroom. The fragrance of the dish was great and it would be a good choice of a vegetarian.   The hamachi was recommend by the server and it got to be one of the worst hamachi. It had a weird after taste.   The pork belly ramen was a so so dish. The broth was nothing special. The pork belly was really good just like the one in the bao. The brisket Is wayyyy to salty!  Overall, due to lack of service and food quality. I wouldnt come back or recommend to anyone.",

    "text": "I think a lot of people will say that the menu is overpriced, but you have to consider that anything in vegas will cost a premium.    Price aside, I ordered the chicken katsu.  It was ok, but I definitely struggled to see why it cost 34 dollars.  It didn't even include rice, which was an extra four dollars for a bowl.  The portion size was fairly large though.    I also ordered the pork bun, which was also ok, but not amazing.  The pork was tender, but a little dry.  The chilli sauce they give you to go with your buns was pretty interesting though.  It almost tasted similar to those mexican chili candies you used to get in grade school.    I then ordered two bowls of ramen, which was worth coming for.  I had the pork ramen and the chickpea ramen.  The pork ramen was great, but I was surprised at how much I liked the chickpea ramen.    Overall, service was good.  Price is ok, considering the location.  I feel that perhaps being caught up in the momofuku hype set my expectations really high, but I think other than the ramen, the other dishes were a little underwhelming. I apologize if perhaps it's my untrained palate, but that's honestly how I felt about my experience here.",

Thankfully, for a friends birthday, we came here for dinner! Our reservation group was quite large, 14-15 of us? Too big for 1 reservation so we did 3 reservations separately and that was fine, we all sat close enough we just shifted tables. The food was delicious! We had the pork bun, the big eye tuna with foie gras, oysters, pork ramen, chilled spicy noodles, Spicy Sichuan Rice Cakes (shared between 3). It was just the right amount of food with a tremendous amount of flavor. Wine was ok, i don't think the food was meant for wine pairing.   My biggest complaint was this waiter / bus boy guy, not sure which he was, probably the ladder, but he gave us a weird look of discrimination and degrading demeanor. One of our friends had one too many glasses of wine, and he instantly went to a manager to tattle and they said they would call an ambulance for him if he didn't get up, so we were forced to have someone leave with him.  Overall the experience was great, minus the waiter / bus boy and our drunk friend.",

I got the clams which made the 21 dollar price tag seem kind of worth it because it took longer to eat. We also ordered a few small dishes. The mash potatoes were extremely buttery. Very friendly (and attractive) staff made the experience better.",

Got a few tasty treats from the kitchen along what was ordered. They have some really great options to choose from and the menu would probably satisfy most palettes. Lot of bold and bright flavors , and also a lot of rich dishes.   Some of our items included :  Beets with citrus supremes ; simple but great flavors   Confit potatos ; no need to say more   Spicy Noodle dish with candied cashews. Great heat and nice balance from the cashews   Pork belly buns : who needs an explanation , it's Pork belly.  Baked oysters with kim chee and some really flavorful bread crumbs. Not an oyster guy but great flavors and texture.   Also the Chefs passed us a couple bites of the salt and pepper shrimp; wow.",

Also ordered the pork belly ramen and miso chick pea ramen. I preferred the pork belly broth better. The miso broth was too sweet.  My husband had the ginger scallion ramen. This is a cold ramen mixed with seaweed and grated ginger and scallions. It was surprisingly refreshing. We were shocked since we expected a broth.    I can't believe it but we also ordered kimchee for $9  I could have bought a jar for that price. When I asked if it was spicy like Korean kimchee our waitress said no since due to health code regulations they could not ferment kimchee. Well.... it is exactly like Korean kimchee. The one we ate was not fermented but tasted fresh. Still it hit the spot with the ramen.   The rice was undercooked, it was not like typical Asian steamed rice.",

She answered all the questions I had regarding their menu and with that being said I ordered the pork bao buns and ramen!   Being an upscale restaurant you already expect to pay a high price for food. When it comes to a higher quality dinner I expect the flavors in the dish to have some kind of twist or are amped up in some way. The pork bao buns definitely met expectations. Pork was cooked perfectly and tasted amazing with the spicy/tangy sauce they served with it. Although I wish the orders came with two instead of one. Unfortunately the ramen did not meet expectations. I was disappointed because for the price and for momofuku being known for their Noodle Bar in NY, the dish was pretty average tasting. The pork in it was good but too much for the soup, especially since the broth tasted pork based too. I could get better ramen in many of the local ramen places here in Las Vegas.   Overall I gave this restaurant 3 stars for good service and good bao. Their menu doesn't seem to be cohesive as an asian fusion food specialty restaurant. I hope if I decide to give this place another chance that it will not disappoint. I will probably just order their bao buns and a different entre!",

I'm soooo glad that they had a vegetarian ramen that was the chickpea ramen, as well as the shiitake baos! Both were absolutely incredible! The flavor on the shiitake had a great rich umami flavor, as well as the chickpea ramen.  Most vegetarian ramen sure bland or don't have the same richness that pork based broth does, but this one was absolutely phenomenal! Split the ramen with a friend who was a carnivore, and he definitely approved. Service was pretty good, and the food came out pretty quick, as well!

    "text": "Pros: ambiance, vibe, passable food.  I had the chance to try momofuku in Las Vegas after hearing a lot rumblings about it from the east coast. I only had two dishes: the karaage bun and pork ramen. My review will be based on these two dishes.  The karaage bun was pretty good! Juicy, crispy and flavorful. Nothing spectacularly outstanding, but it definitely does hold its own.  The pork ramen on the other hand was disappointingly not that good. I am well versed in ramen (tried some of the best joints in Japan and in the US) and I must say although the pork ramen at momofuku is unique, I thought there were a multitude of things that would have an expert ramen chef crying.   The pork ramen is very smokey. This can be a plus for many people but for me I felt it overpowered the dish. The other aspect that I felt was lacking was in the noodles. In Japan, how the noodle is cooked is a big deal in how it pairs with the soup base. In this particular case, the noodle was over boiled-- thus causing a little too much chewiness. Also in terms of how it blended with the smokey soup, you would think the noodle and soup were on a bad date and didn't exactly click.   What I didn't really care for was the poached egg. It could be somewhat of a personal taste, but the consistency of the egg made the ramen hard to eat once the egg broke apart.   The ramen wasn't necessarily bad as it is something that I thought was unique and creative but in terms of its ranking and place in the ramen world, I would say it didn't have enough of a pull to draw me back to the restaurant again in the future.",

Peking duck in making was fun to see for the kids.  Sommelier was young and seemed knowledgeable with new age wine and sake as well.  Pork belly bun and ramen were great dishes for the kids and adults alike. Whole branzino was my favorite.  Light but flavorful and guiltless meal.  Service was attentive. Would try again when back in town",

My partner and I came for lunch and split a few different items: shrimp bun, shiitake bun, and pork ramen. The buns are excellent and  something I'd definitely get as it's own meal. The pork ramen is to die for, easily heaven in a bowl. The pork belly and shoulder add good flavor to the ramen and just melt in your mouth.  *The drink menu is also worth a try.  Treat yo self with something from Momofuku Noodle Bar (and save room for dessert)! You won't regret it.",

We ended up having an early dinner at the restaurant as well... our server Max (i think that's his name) was very informative, pleasant and such a gem and a great addition to this restaurant. He knew what he was talking about, the menu, the food, the chef and even the music selection that they had in the background.  For food - i tried the spicy cucumber, it was ok... the pork ramen was good, the broth was light and not milky (more americanized pork ramen i would say)... the chicken noodle soup is more asian than american - that was also good... i love the shrimp bun, big shrimp patties sandwiched in a bun - i would order that again... the rotisserie chicken was crunchy and good but i thought it was a tad salty... then the $90 golden ossetra on top of fried chicken appetizer was also good of you eat it as is... the caviar on its own is good but does have a fishy aftertaste- but if you eat it with the lemony mayo and chicken it comes with, then its really good. I would definitely come back for the experience - the food - shrimp bun and the icecream!",

    "text": "I had Momofuku on my 'would-like to visit list' for Vegas for a few years now and this year I finally made the trip. I started with a miso honey cocktail, and it was hands-down the best cocktail I've ever tasted. It managed to be sweet, salty, umami, sour and herb-y all at the same time and I was having a mouthgasm upon first sip. I don't know how you get so much flavor into a gin cocktail, but I would (and did) drink it again.   On to the food. We tried out the famous pork buns, they were fabulous. After the first bite my SO wished we just ordered more and skipped the entree. But then.... the Bo Ssam. The waiter warned us, 'That is a lot of food' and we thought, 'oh I'm sure it won't be so much that we'll be in serious trouble', they said 3-4 people on the menu (they should have put 6-8). So we're sitting at this veritable feast wondering why we didn't bring a hollow limb to shove the extras, and still looking longingly at the tasty pull apart pork shoulder... they kindly boxed up and bagged up the extras. God bless the waiter. We had leftovers for days, thank you in-room fridge and microwave.   Go to Momofuku, eat the Bo Ssam. Maybe skip the pork buns and just order extra empty buns to wrap up your porky entree. That's what we do at home now (David Chang has a cookbook, and all the good things are in there). It is a pricey establishment, but I would say they quite literally made 'the best' of everything we had ever tasted, and the portions were generous. Momofuku, I'll be seeing you again.  And one last thing... be aware that they change their menu frequently. The pork buns and the Bo Ssam are two of the main stays, but I wouldn't be shocked if other dishes come and go with some frequency.",

I liked how the bartender told us how to eat the egg (poke it a little and let the yolk run into the soup & noodles). Great idea!!! I'd definitely come back!

    "text": "My boyfriend and I have been following David Chang's career for quite a while. We are from Chicago but we were in Vegas for the weekend and decided we couldn't pass up the opportunity to check out his restaurant.   This is what we ordered: Bigeye Tuna Sichuan Lamb Ribs Ginger Scallion Noodles 4 ounces of A5 Hokkaido Wagyu Spring Fling cocktail Bonji Old Fashioned Peruvian Sour Cocktail Yuzu Lemonade   Our favorites were the Wagyu, Lamb ribs, Tuna, and the yuzu lemonade. We really wanted the Black Truffle Ramen but it wasn't on the menu when we went. The cocktails were pretty good however the yuzu lemonade outshined them. It was a flavor of citrus that was familiar but completely new at the same time. I loved the shaved fois gras and strawberry with the tuna. It was sweet and complex. Best way to start the meal. The lamb was exceptionally tender and flavorful. The wagyu was cooked in front of us and served with raw egg yolk, bonji, and fermented yuzu. It was delicious. The only thing that wasn't much to rave about was the Ginger Scallion Noodles and I think the pacing of how they served us was to blame. The food was not staggered to allow us to finish our food before the next plate came out. This was especially frustrating when our expensive Wagyu came out and we had just been served the lamb and noodle dish moments before. Since the wagyu was so pricey and they put on a show for us, we were forced to ignore the other food on the table as it was getting cold. The lamb was still to die for but the noodles stiffened into a block and became difficult to mix with the toppings. Judging based on the noodles being cold they weren't very flavorful. Everything sort of blended together and the only flavor or texture came from the ginger and mushroom. Even though the noodles weren't great, we had a great meal and will be visiting other David Chang restaurants in the future.",

The oysters they used were creamy and paired perfectly with the greens they had as garnish. The drop of the chili sauce they recommended completed the finish.   Pork belly bun was so great! Soft, doughy bread, fatty pork belly in the middle.   Ramen made the whole meal complete. It wasn't the best ramen I've had, but it was comforting and delicious. Adding spice to it definitely helped win over my taste buds.   Everything was enjoyed with their Momofuku sake. Didn't know a bottle of sake was going to cost $88 (so probably wouldn't order that again) but it was a nice, light fruit sake and was enjoyed then and saved for more consumption later.   Ambiance was nice. It was a weird time when the sun was setting down, so it was a little dark for my taste but overall we had a great experience.",

Definitely unique flavors and unique fusion foods available here. It was pretty expensive but I did order a lot. The appetizers were amazing and everything was perfectly cooked and full of flavors. I can't wait to come back!",

I also decided on the cold spicy noodle dish that unfortunately brought up the only detractor from this visit. My order was fumbled by the server, since I was seated at the bar the bartender took my order but never followed up, so when the gentleman next to me sat down he was greeted with my dish just minutes after ordering his. I try not to be a jerk when I'm out dining but I had two empty plates in front of me and the bartender who wasn't taking my order decided to check on me, when he did I let him know that I had not received my last dish. The bartender taking my order went to the back to resolve the issue but he never came to me to let me know that things would be resolved nor did he apologize he simply stated to his coworker \"oh well things happen\"...I basically overheard the steps being taken on my order. It was a bit annoying and frustrating to deal with this environment but I think the real issue is that these bartenders are better at making drinks than they are taking food orders. When I received my dish it was delicious...but I wanted that momofuku hospitality I've heard about before.",

Counting the days to visit Vegas again to try the rest of the menu.  (For the record we as a table collectively ordered: shishito peppers, pork meatballs, fried brussel sprouts, pork belly steamed buns,  chicken karaage steamed buns, smothered katsu chicken, prime new york strip, smoked pork chop, and of course the pork ramen)",

    "text": "Before you decide to eat here. Make sure you know you will be paying the top $$$ for the food that you consider to be cheap, elsewhere. So, you've got to be a fan of David Chang and appreciate his take on the dishes. (Not to mention the quality of their products and the executions) My verdict after the visit, I will be making that reservation at Major Domo very soon (been trying since they opened up in Chinatown, L.A). Who are we kidding? We go to Momofuku because we all are Chef Chang's groupies!!! The food - uniquely Chef Chang creations. The familiar dishes done with chef Chang's vision. Those baos were soft and fluffy. The proteins were cooked perfectly. I loved how the shrimp patty still had the plump texture of shrimp & not dry at all. The pork chashu was perfect - soft but still has the meaty bite. Baos were perfect two bite app to start with. Now to the ramen, granted my all time favorite ramen is half the cost of Momofuku's, I enjoyed the soup and the fixins until the last drop.  Honestly, the shoyu based noodle soup did not blow my mind but you can taste the quality. Make sure to taste the soup as it is, grab the nori and slurp down the al dente noodles, swish around get some of the shredded pork with bean sprouts get the taste of the topping, then break the poached egg and mix it with everything. The runny eggs gave the soup richness and balanced the soy broth out. The most interesting dish I've had there was the spicy cucumber appetizer and the cold spicy noodles. I mean it was little bit weird when I first bit into it. Pickled cucumber with toasted marcona almonds, sprinkled with togarashi. A simple dish that resembled the Japanese kyuri tsukemono, Chinese version of cold cucumber salad, & Korean oyi sobagi. Definitely something I never had. Spicy cold noodle was great!! The sweet Thai basil pesto cold noodles with cashews & spicy peppers. The perfect blend of sweet & spicy - the cashew nuts were the sweet, nutty crunchy factor & the basil pesto was so refreshing and tasty!! The pork patty definitely belongs with the noodles and I enjoyed everything together. Jidori chicken rubbed with curry tasted moist and flavorful. Kimchi on the plate, however wasn't so tasty. Service was as expected, courteous & friendly. We showed up fashionably early (30 min before) but they accommodated us to be seated earlier. The bar looks like fun and dining area was spacious and comfortable (our booth). So overall, a very satisfying dining experience for a chef Chang admirer~",

Before our table was ready we enjoyed a drink at the bar - penicillin for him and canned grapefruit sparkling wine for me. Very similar to a grapefruit radler.  The dining room offers gratuitous views of The Strip and lots of local graffiti art. It was bustling even after 10 pm on a Tuesday.   We ordered a bottle of white burgundy, buns, and ginger scallion noodles. Usually I'm not a mushroom lover but when marinaded in Asian goodness, I'll gobble them up.   Never once was our glass remotely empty, food came out fast. It was what one might expect from a Vegas dinner at a super hip place. Expensive but hip.",

I love that the menu had different price ranges to accommodate everyone's pocket. I LOVED the spicy rice cakes. The taste of those rice cakes are still in my mouth. I LOVED the spicy noodles, the aroma of basil and combination of spice and sausage was the best thing I never knew I was missing. I wasn't crazy about the ginger noodles, the flavor is bland however I still enjoyed it. The potato crisps were life. I wanna eat here all day no lie.

Super passionate about what he does and mixes the best cocktail! I had the DC which is not on the cocktail menu and it's heavenly; the cocktail is light, easy to drink, fruity yet it's got a punch in the end that finishes off nicely. I can confidently say that momofuku offers the best cocktail in Vegas.  Ordered the half a dozen oysters, roasted corn and pork belly bun.   Nothing to say about the pork belly bun as it's always good.   Oyster is always fresh and top quality.   Roasted corn which is new is super delicious and the spotlight. It is a Mexican Korean street corn mix style served on a plate. The cheese is definitely the highlight as it is the key element that makes the dish.",

    "text": "I came here with my boyfriend last week because I had always wanted to try the place out. Unfortunately when we came it was during their Social Hour so we were limited to a smaller menu and only bar seating. Although it was pretty cool watching the chefs cook our food and getting everything ready for dinner service.   My boyfriend and I both were intrigued by the buns that were on the menu. I decided to get the pork belly bun while he got the shrimp bun. After just a few short minutes we were presented with our order. I did not try his shrimp bun as I dont eat spicy dishes but he loved it. As for my pork belly bun, it was far better than I could have imagined! The sauce is similar to a sweet plum sauce that is usually served with duck entrees. The pork belly was very soft and cooked perfectly accompanied by cucumbers giving it a great crunch texture.  We ended up getting one more order of each because they were so fantastic. I definitely want to come back here during regular lunch or dinner hours in order to try out full menu items.",

    "text": "Good: Shrimp bao was decent, the patty was solid- visible shrimps, balanced seasoning and pleasant flavors. Pairing with the pickle and a dash of lettuce is a refreshing touch.  Bad: Waiter took long to bring us anything- menu, drinks, food... Place is semi-busy, and seems understaffed for Sunday lunch service.... We were served our raw oysters AFTER our hot main entree arrived. What a shame.  (Ramen only) Forgive me, for I'm a bit of a ramen connoisseur... You'll see many reviews of ramen by me. Momofuku Vegas' Shoyu pork ramen is not that great. 5/10, mediocre broth and just a dumb-lazy idea of the soft poached egg in the broth. While I can see the chashu pork was cooked nicely, it's very sparse at 1 slice (same slice they put in the buns). Ramen seems store-made, and rather plenty and al-dente... The broth was a disappointment. Lacking in character, umami, yes, not too salty, somewhat... what else? Dunno.   The poached egg annoyed me. It's plain tasteless, and lazy- The moment it punctures, egg yellow ejaculates into the broth to make exactly one spoonful of soup slush- doesn't go further cause the egg yolk is half cooked already and broth is hot so it solidifies on its way out- Making one spoonful of solid...liquid \"WTF is this?\". Plus the egg white is non-existent... That chewy stuff ramen folks like about their eggs, completely missing, disappeared into this semen looking substance dissolving into my broth. Real ramen shops do Ajitsuke Tamago, so you can soak up the broth with both the soft yolk and the solid egg white, without polluting the broth with soggy tasteless egg smudge. In this case, I can tell Momofuku is just plain lazy- whoever designed the menu was streamlining kitchen processes, otherwise he had wtf poor taste in ramen. Proper Ajitsuke Tamago takes days to marinate and prepare. Poached eggs- You just crack it into soup when it's hot, and it tastes like JIZZ. This is what college kids do with their Shin Ramyun. Unforgivable for a restaurant like this that's supposed to know how to make good ramen. If you're particular about good ramen, do not order ramen here it'll piss you off.",

I got the pork ramen, and it was by far the most disappointing ramen I ever got:  - it came with pork shoulder, but I didn't get that. Instead, it was a big blob of fat without any meat on it. Seriously? How can that happen?  - the ramen was really simple: just broth, meat, egg and noodles. I would have expected a bit more ingredients so I don't feel like I'm just eating noodles and broth.  - the broth was good. It had a really strong pork flavor, which not everyone liked in my party, but I personally thought it was a good twist on the usual ramen broth.  The service was good though.",

From the moment we were seated the server was very attentive to our needs. For appetizer, we started off with shrimp buns. The bread on the shrimp buns is quite possibly the best I've ever tasted! We were torn between what to order for a main dish and the server recommended the Steamed Whole Branzino. I don't normally eat whole fish but it tasted 10 times better than I expected. My only problem was that I wish I had ordered two! I would highly recommend this restaurant for anyone visiting Las Vegas. Great food, atmosphere, and quality service.",

There were three of us and we had a fair number of questions about what to get, which he answered informatively. First: We ended up getting pork belly buns which were so good! Put a little of the signature ssam sauce on them (which you can buy at Walmart, Amazon and Whole Foods.) Then we had roasted brussel sprouts and cauliflower, with Katsu sauce, Kewpie mayo and Bonita...such a wonderful combination of flavors. Our entree was a sharable  (3-6 people) dish of Snake River Farms Wagyu beef, with fried corn and kimchi potato salad. OMG!! The beef was delicious on its own, served between medium and mid-rare. Lettuce leaves and two sauces accompanied the meat so you could make your own lettuce wraps. The corn? Fabulous, cut in small pieces you could pick up and eat with your hands, dressed lightly with a bacon ranch sauce. The kimchi potato salad seemed to be light on the kimchi flavor, reminding us of a fairly typical potato salad. There is 32 oz of beef, which we could not finish, so the next day we ate a cold lunch of the leftovers, and now felt the potato salad was much better. A sommelier helped us with a wine selection within our budget and a good fit for our meal. We finished with a chocolate truffle that was a sweet ending although not made in-house. Splurge a little, as it is a totally memorable experience.",

    "text": "I was so stoked when I heard David Chang opened up a Momofuku in Las Vegas; no more flying out to New York. My family and I came here for lunch on a Saturday and I'd thought the wait time would be over an hour but it was less than 30 minutes but if we wanted to sit in the dining area, the wait would've been 2.5 hours for the next available table.   The lunch menu was simple and didn't have too much clutter like most restaurants. We ordered the Brussels sprouts and pear & burrata salad to start. I enjoyed the taste of the grilled Brussel sprouts with its tangy sauce accompanied with cilantro. Flavor wise I'd give it a 8/10, since it wasn't anything too spectacular but I liked how it wasn't too salty for my taste. The pear and burrata salad was something I would've skipped. I didn't enjoy it at all but my family had an okay feeling towards it.   Next up, we ordered their buns (pork belly, shrimp and cod). Pork belly was probably the better tasting one in my opinion, probably because of the fat but who cares. It was a big slab of pork belly and the fish and shrimp was kinda small compared to it. We also ordered a Spicy Noodle with their Sichuan sausage, cashew and basil. The taste was interesting to say the least but t had great flavor and taste.   Lastly, 3 of us ordered the pork belly ramen and that was phenomenal. It's been years since I had it in New York and my god was it worth the wait. The broth was rich in flavor, not too salty and full of MSG. The soft boiled egg was heaven and I broke it right away to mix with the broth. I do have to say that the ramen is not what you'd expect from a Japanese ramen shop from say Little Tokyo in LA or Sawtelle since it's a different style of cooking but still worth trying nonetheless. If you're ever in Vegaz, definitely give this place a try if the wait isn't too long and head next door to Milk Bar for their cookies and their Crack Pie.",

This was our first time here and we were open to suggestions. She did an excellent job describing the drinks and cocktails and even gave me a small sample of their slushes. Although she was busy making cocktails for others, she still chatted with us and made it a great experience.   We got a beet salad, 2 shrimp buns (the shrimp is in a patty and she explained that when describing), a country ham platter (the menu didn't say that the smaller portions came with a chive biscuit, but it did). The ham was fatty which isn't a complaint since I know that's how it comes, but wanted to mention it in case you wouldn't like that. They also sent out the spicy cucumber salad with the chef's compliments. It was very spicy, but sounded like it isn't usually that bad. Leah offered to have it remade, but we declined. My bf put too much hot sauce on his shrimp bun and she also offered to have that remade. We didn't do it, but it was a nice gesture. All of the food and cocktails were very good!  Our bill with that food and 4 cocktails was $120.",

Not sure if they changed the chef or the owner. Everytime we pointed at the photos on Yelp they said they don't make it anymore. We ended up ordering oyster (6 small ones for $28) and their signature pork buns. The server will most likely suggest you the soyu sea bass, which is quite good, but for $56, I expected a much larger portion (you get half slide of the fish). We spent more than $150 for 2 people and felt we could have spent on the buffet with so much more selection and still cheaper. The menu is quite limited. If you come before 5:30 you will be seated in the front, bar area where they have a different menu. After 5:30pm you can go into the dining section for a different menu (which we did). We had to order a sichuan noodle to fill up, after raw oysters, pork buns, sea bass. Overall food was good, but for the price we knew we had other better options.",

The restaurant is located inside of the Cosmopolitan Hotel, and it gets pretty packed past 7pm. The restaurant looks very modern from the outside and is located right next to Milk ( the dessert place in NY for those who are not familiar with it). We waited for about an hour to get seated, but were given the option to order drinks at the bar.   The menu was mostly family style plates, but we all really wanted their ramen. The two options we all went for were either the spicy cold noodles or the pork shoyu ramen (which is not on the menu but can be ordered). The ramen came in a pretty small bowl, but there was a decent amount of meat, both pork belly and carnitas, and a perfectly poached egg. The ramen was nothing special--it tasted like fancy cup noodles. I wasn't impressed with the broth or the noodles. The best part about the ramen was honestly the griddled pork belly and the poached egg.   My friends ordered the chilled noodle and pork belly bao bun, and they said those two items were better than the ramen. I was pretty disappointed with the experience, as I saw how busy it was in NY when I last visited.",

The prices are..Vegas prices, but it's what you expect. Service is always great and the food is amazing!!  I swear I've had everything on the menu thanks to my near monthly work trips to Vegas. My running favorite is the Cold Spicy Noodles, hands down. That said, the rack of lamb, shisito peppers, cold cucumbers, pork bun, and ssam are all great choices!  You really can't go wrong with anything here.",

The ramen was decent but I felt the noodles were a bit over cooked and softer than they should be. The pork bun was tasty and much better than chairman Bao in SF but that doesn't say much since the bar there is not high.   Overall, I felt the food was good but way overpriced. We paid $35 for one bowl of ramen and one pork bun. It was extremely filling though!! We were full for hours.",

Sadly, the service made our experience much less than 5 stars but since I prefer to judge on food I have it a 4. Buns were amazing, the Unami one is a must! The spicy cucumber app was refreshing and unique. Cold noodle salad was perfect and a big portion surprisingly. We also got the chicken which was pretty big and had great flavors. Atmosphere is cool (don't judge it from the front). Just our waitress was not good. She came up to our table didn't even introduce herself, give us a menu rundown, make us feel welcome. She literally said \"Are you ready to order?\"  So you can imagine that was an annoying way to start the meal. She just seemed annoyed and we literally felt uncomfortable asking her for things. Probably wouldn't go back but the food was good.",

    "text": "I've wanted to eat at one of David Chang's restaurants ever since I saw him on Mind of a Chef, so I was excited to learn a Momofuku had opened on the west coast.  Momofuku is a casual sit down restaurant with a cool vibe.  We walked in on a weekday evening to the music bumpin' and were seated right away.  The dinner menu is geared towards family-style dining, so you can share dishes and the food comes out of the kitchen as it's ready instead of all at once.    I knew I wanted to try their famous Pork Ramen ($17) and Pork Bun ($7).  The pork bun came out first and was tasty.  The bun was soft and light, and the pork belly had a nice crispy char.  The only thing I didn't like was that the pork was very fatty.  The ramen is not on the dinner menu, but they will serve it.  It was slightly disappointing from the get-go because it didn't come out piping hot.  The broth was savory and flavorful, but salty.  Not the best ramen ever, but it was a filling bowl with pork belly, shredded pork, a fish cake, a perfectly poached egg and veggies.        To balance out all the pork, we also shared the Steamed Whole Branzino ($68).  This fish dish had interesting flavors of lemon, herbs and brown butter dashi.  The brown butter gave it a richness, but the lemon and pickled veggies took over the dish.  If you like tangy, citrus dishes, this might be for you.  They serve desserts from their sister bakery next door, Milk Bar.  Since it was my birthday, I was treated to birthday cake truffles.  This was a really sweet gesture, figuratively and literally.  Overall the food was pretty good, but in my mind I expected more from a James Beard award winning chef.",

Hearing about how incredible his food is one thing, but being the closest you ever have been is something else. The menu is extensive, but approachable. It's not an overwhelming selection, but the right assortment to help every customer figure out exactly what dish will compliment their dining experience. I went for the duck and feel like I chose the best item. Every bite of the duck was better than the last and paired so well with everything else on the plate. Creating my own lettuce wraps with a decadently cooked duck created the best environment for me to experience the wondrous recipes from David Chang. The lettuce was fresh, rice steamed, duck divine, and accompaniments making every bite different than the last.  Make it a point to visit this establishment, and if possible, multiple times on your trip!",

Considered the stuffed buns, but kept True to my intent to enjoy ramen.  Pork Ramen consisted of a seared pork belly & shoulder, add bok choy ($7), seaweed, looked like arugula, bean sprouts, and slow poached egg.  It was served super fast and was a not piping hot, but hot enough. The pork belly is about the size of a deck of cards and was delish. A sliver dollar sized piece of the poor shoulder lurked underneath. The noodles were decent as was the broth.  $31 w/tip. It is Momofuku and it is Las Vegas.",

    "text": "30 Sec Review: Simply put, the food is good and you pay a premium for some of it, like the pork buns. Others, like the ramen, you pay a reasonable price. The food is delicious, tasty, but I can't say it's wildly unique. To be fair, I chose pretty standard items.  Pros: -That Yelp cache of being at Momofuku -Nice staff, attentive -Food is good -You're not overpaying for everything  Cons: -Overpay for the buns  Ambience, service, the feel you'd expect from a restaurant at Momofuku's level of fame is all as expected. So I won't dive into that. My food guide is short and sweet, since I was a table of one. Before you go on, basically I'd say Momofuku is good food, nice Asian flavors but will probably shine best if you choose more outlandish creations.  Food Reps Shrimp Bun - $7 This is where I think you're over paying. One single, albeit tasty bun for $7 is quite a premium. The shrimp patty is delicious, with some iceberg lettuce and a delicate bun. I wouldn't get it again because it tasted as good as other Asian shrimp-centric meals you could have elsewhere.    Pork Belly Shoyu Ramen - $17 Now this is steep for a ramen entree in ways, but I've been to quality OC ramen shops that run near this price when you include all the damn add-ons. So $17 was reasonable enough for me. The ramen was also tasty. The fatty pork... wow to the flavor bomb! The actual pork shoulder or belly, a bit thick for this type of meal. Would've preferred chasu really. But the bowl was a good bowl, just not my cup of tea.",

I would say, just try it just to say you've tried it, but I would recommend people over to Milk Bar more than Momofuku haha.",

We both shared the Shishito Peppers, which were really good and a great start to the meal. I ordered the Jidori Chicken Bowl....wow!

I didn't have too big of an appetite so I ended up only ordering a pork belly bun and the parmesan truffle potatoes (for sharing). The potatoes were good with the toppings, but I will note that they were not that crispy and not seasoned beyond the toppings. Paired with the toppings it was delicious, just when we got to the bottom we didn't finish it. The pork belly was good, not as tender as I would have preferred but I am picky with my food. I still enjoyed it and wouldn't mind coming back for the dinner menu. My companions ordered a ramen and the spicy fried chicken sandwich as well, which they seemed to enjoy.  We ordered some drinks and while I don't remember which ones we ordered, I remember them being really good.",

Being LA based, the only opportunity that I would have had was Majordomo, which at the time, was hard to get a reservation for at the time so I jumped at the opportunity to make a reservation here. Since this was my birthday dinner with my family (and I didn't pay), we kinda splurged. We ended up getting the salt and pepper lobster and shrimp, which was as decadent as it sounds. However, the stand out dishes, in my opinion, were the short rib kimchi stew, the Honeycrisp apple salad, and the pork belly bun. Honestly, I would come back just to have more of the pork belly buns. Also, I really liked the vibe of the restaurant. I was fortunate enough to get a table right next to the window, allowing me a spectacular view of the strip. Overall, I'd definitely dine here again the next time I'm in Vegas. Will definitely skip out on the shrimp and lobster (and generally stay away from the pricier family style options) though!",

    "text": "We came here for lunch on a Saturday. There was no wait. The restaurant is spacious and you can see Vegas strip from the window.   We ordered  - pork ramen: pork belly, pork shoulder, poached egg; this bowl of ramen was very flavorful. The pork belly was amazing. It may look like a small bowl but it has all the key ingredients to make it delicious.   - chilled spicy noodles: Sichuan sausage, Thai basil, candied cashew. This was good as well but I would say I like the ramen more. It has a refreshing (from the basil) but spicy taste at the same time.   Value: definitely on the expensive sides for noodles but I would still recommend this place if you are looking for a lighter meal (rather than all the Vegas buffet options).   Also, don't forget to try the soft serve from Milk Bar to finish up the meal with something sweet!",

It was not bad at all. How was the service? It was great. Can you make a reservation? Yes. I made a reservation for Friday night at 9pm at 7pm for a party of 7 easily. I thought the meal was expensive, but then again we were in Vegas, so it was expected! The servers were great! The waitress was not very attentive, but the servers were! They serve multi-Asian cuisines and it was a good experiences! The ramen and the katsu chicken was okay, not worth the price. The Bo Ssam was good, but it was not worth $134. I can say that I have tried them though, for the experience! ;)",

The bun is similar to what you get at a Peking duck restaurant: white bun, cucumber, sauce plus the meat, basically not streamed but sandwiched together. Afterwards I ordered a pork ramen, it tasted good, the broth was rich but not salty (a lot of ramen places I've tried have broth too salty for my taste). Though the food was good, it was definitely overpriced.",

We ordered and shared most of the food items and they are all tasty and with nice presentations.  We enjoyed the lamb ribs, Benton smoked ham, cucumber salad, shrimp slider, and pork belly slider and one of their signature noodle (slightly salty).  It was a good stop gap before the Pac 12 Final and only a 15 mins walk away from T-Mobile Arena.  Definitely will repeat and request a seat at the noodle bar or chef counter to watch some kitchen action.  On the pricey side but it is a destination eatery in Vegas.  Reservation is strongly recommended.",

    "text": "Momofuku was such a great experience.  The wait staff was top notch.  The bartender was fast, knowledgeable, and made some great cocktails for us before we were shown to our table.  The vibe of the place was really great. Trendy and upscale.  The food was delicious.  I went with a group of 4 people and we all shared.  My favorites:  The Pork Buns!  Oh good lawd, the pork buns!  They were the best.  I could have eaten 90 of em.  At the end of the meal, I wanted to order one more before we left, but I was stuffed.  I think the thing that I noticed the most was how the unique flavors and textures of everything that made up the pork bun stood out.  And they all came together perfectly to make up a little piece of gastronomical heaven.  The Katsu Chicken - I don't like mushrooms usually, but as I get older I find myself not minding them so much.  And I sometimes find myself loving a dish that is loaded with mushrooms.  This Katsu Chicken is near the top of that list.  It was the last thing that we ate and despite me being as full as I could be, I easily and happily stuffed the rest of this dish down my gullet.  I'm tellin ya, it's SOOOO GOOD.  This creamy mushroom gravy sauce poured over a fried chicken cutlet (I guess it was kind of a cutlet).  The sauce reminded me of what you would get on chicken marsala.  It was off the chain good.  Pork Ramen - The pork ramen was super delicious and super rich.  I would actually say that it holds its own with the top ramen places in vegas and it could be argued that it's even better.  I was hugely impressed.  I'm having a little trouble thinking of all the good things about it, but please don't let that lead you to believe that it's not way up there with the other aforementioned items because it is.  The other items that we ordered were the New York Strip and a side of the Pomme Puree (I think that's what it was called).  They were both delicious, 5/5 for sure, but they aren't standing out in my memory as much as the others, so take that how you will.  Bon Appetit!",

Easy to spot on second floor across from Marquee. Was a breeze making and modifying reservations on open table. Milk Bar is less than 2 steps away - word on the street is you can order dessert straight to your table, drastically expediting the rate of compost cookie to mouth.  The could be better: Perhaps it was the time of day (Saturday 2:30pm) or the fact that David Chang's newest outpost is only a little more than a month old and miles away from momofuku central (NYC), both my dad and I found our ramens, pork ($18) and chickpea ($18) respectively, too salty. I could taste the potential, and it was definitely there, but the saltiness was too overpowering.  Having lived down the street from Nishi in NY and loving it, I really wanted to love this meal, and I probably will if I return in the future, but this time it was just alright.  Excited to try the baos and crack pie soft serve in ze foreseeable future. Skipped both this time because summer's a-coming and my body's already composed of 8% cereal milk soft serve from living in the city.",

A Highlight was the cucumber appetizer. When we asked about it they explained the cucumbers were soaked in salt and sugar overnight to extract moisture from the vegetable. It was absolutely fabulous. The rest of the meal was also very good. We had a couple of fish entrees which were very tasty, then finished with the lobster tails and duck. The duck presentation was very fun. It included carving of the duck breast at the table and a foie gras spread across rice topped with the slices of duck breast. Very tender and tasteful. My one criticism would be that the restaurant seemed a bit dark and the table was a bit sticky.",

I've heard rave reviews about David Chang's infamous pork ramen, but it was a toasty day in Vegas and the last thing I wanted was a boiling bowl of noodle soup. I had a pork belly bun to start. $7 might seem like a lot for a palm-sized bun, but you're definitely getting what you're paying for. The steamed bun was light and fluffy, and the thick slab of pork belly was perfectly cooked and melts in your mouth. My server recommended the chilled spicy noodles - fresh chilled ramen tossed in a pesto sauce (weird, but it works!) and topped with Sichuan sausage, candied cashews, and SPICY peppers. I'm glad this dish was served chilled, because the spice level built up quickly, though it was so good I couldn't stop eating. The service was amazing; I probably gulped down five glasses of water while eating my noodles, and my water glass never got below half-full. Tip - if there's room available, definitely snag a seat at the noodle counter! The guys working back there are friendly and entertaining and you can tell they take pride in their work. I'm definitely stopping by here when it's a little cooler to try that ramen!",

Chopstick.. in this caliber of a restaurant I would not expect a wooden disposable chopstick, cutting cost? I would expect better utensils at a well known restaurant in a hotel. Ordered truffle ramen $50 definitely won't order it again can barely taste the truffle after we mix it up but that's a preference other might like it but for me it is not worth the $50. Ordered the duck, this dish is great. Will definitely order again in the future if decided to come back.",

Overall, left feeling like I had a decent meal that didn't live up to the hype and prices with ok service in a decent environment.  Food: Pork ramen was fine. They use pork shoulder and the texture just isnt as good as the firmer and chewier pork slices ramen typically comes with- this innovation, while tender, simply made the mouth-feel of the pork more soft and mushy. The egg was great as would be expected. The ramen wasn't bad and was fairly springy and chewy. Broth was well developed although a little salty. Chicken karage buns were tasty- I enjoyed these.  Service: friendly, not amazing but not bad.Somewhat awkward sitting at the ramen bar looking straight into the kitchen (which is cool) but with chefs/cooks looking at you but not really interacting either-just made it kinda weird.   Value: Sorry, but it is just too expensive for what you get. I think I paid like 18 and 11 for the ramen and buns, respectively? Yes it is Momofuku and yes, it is Vegas, so fine, maybe like 14 and 9 would be reasonable?   Ambiance: chic, modern, pretty cool vibe overall.  A-OK is a good summary.",

Ordered the (1) Shiitake bun, (1) Shrimp bun, (1) Mussel with truffles for starters. For the main course (1) Ginger scallion noodles and (1) cheek pea ramen. The food was great. You can taste the flavor in each item. Every ingredient complimented each other. Nothing too overpowering. Definitely one great place to try when you're in Vegas.",

We started off with the recommended spicy cucumber salad. As basic as that sounds, Momofuku was able transform simple cucumbers into an amazing dish. This was only the start.  For the mains, my friends ordered the pork ramen and curry chicken and for myself, the spicy chilled noodles. Everything was absolutely terrific with the exception of the spicy chilled noodles. That dish was freaking amazing!!!! The chefs were able to combine pesto into a Szhechuan style noodle bowl. Oh my. Their slogan should be simply amazing.   We ended our lunch off with their famous confetti cake which, I heard, is a must try.   Please do yourself a favor and make your way to Momofuku aka food heaven!!",

You're seated immediately and the service is prompt. We sat at the tall tables in the front area. The ambiance is hip and trendy. They play good music but it's not too loud that you can't carry on a conversation. Oh I loved the cocktail called Spring Fling! It was delicious. When it came to ordering food, my husband and I were underwhelmed by the limited menu options. I decided to get the ginger scallion noodle with pork belly and he got the shoyu pork ramen. Mine came with only a few visible ingredients, lightly seasoned (which I didn't mind), and only had one piece of pork belly. I enjoyed it but I just don't think I'll pay $16 for an okay tasting noodle dish again. The hubby thought the ramen lacked the saltiness that one would expect with any ramen dish. Oh and we ordered a shrimp bun as appetizer. It was the saddest tiny bun that costed us $7. Since we don't like any of that raw stuff that was on half of the menu, I feel like our opinion might be biased. But still, the options were limited!",

The Pork Bossam with all of the sides are perfection. The small feeds at least four people as a main course but make sure to try the pork bun and some of the noodle options.

They open for dinner at 5:30pm but they have a bar menu that is before 5:30pm. They strictly seat you at 5:30pm so don't come too early. We got an excellent seat by the windows with all the natural light and a view of the strip.   I started out with the Bonji Old Fashioned and I really enjoyed it. It was very tasty and not overwhelming. For food we went with A5 Hokkaido Wagyu Potatoes, Ginger Scallion Noodles, Pork Belly, Heritage Pork Tomahawk. The food was all great tasting and did not feel overwhelming. It was not greasy or salty. The A5 Hokkaido Wagyu potatoes was probably one of my favorites. The meat we got was cooked perfectly and not too rare. It had a nice flavor and texture. The Ginger Scallion Noodles was a good portion and tasted good. It's a good dish for vegetarians or simple flavor. I really liked it and it comes out warm. The pork belly was mind blowing. The pork belly was so soft and tender. You can just bite it to it without having to wonder if the pork belly will go everywhere. Make sure to dip it in the sauce. The last dish we had was the pork tomahawk. The second you take a bite you will be mind blown. The pork tasted smoky and it then tasted sweet with the sauce. It was cooked to perfection and the rapini accompanied it well. I would highly recommend any of these dishes. You definitely can't go wrong.   For dessert we went with the Crack Pie a la mode. It was amazing. It was my first time having either one. It definitely lives up to the hype. If you can't make it to the restaurant, stop by the Milk bar where they sell both. The ice cream is nice and milky and it is a nice after dinner treat.   I will definitely be back the next time I am in town. Definitely get the pork belly bun. I think it is a must have. I probably would do something quick like the late night menu or the in between lunch/dinner service. I need to try the ramen. But definitely try the dinner first. I was disappointed that they didn't have the duck in a smaller portion and it cost $$$ for the duck. I definitely want to try that one day if I can get a group willing to shell out the $$$.",

This was one meal I was looking forward to after hearing about this eatery on social media, as well as from various friends and my brother.  I also have to be honest to say we chose lunch over dinner since it was more affordable.  NOTE: I made a reservation via OpenTable for 1130am, but we soon discovered that was unnecessary as the restaurant (which opened at 11am) wasn't overly crowded.  LOCATION / SETTING: 2nd level of the Cosmopolitan Las Vegas.  Follow the signage.  Seating areas include a lounge area, the bar, and the main restaurant floor.  The smiling hostess sat us at a table which had a view of the bustling kitchen area.  FOOD: After perusing the menu, we decided on starters of the oysters and orders of the pork and shrimp buns.  My brother and I each had an order of the pork ramen, while my mom continued her seafood regimen and chose the salmon sandwich.    The oysters were ok.  We ordered a half dozen to share.  I was expecting them to be larger, but well that's alright.  The pork and shrimp buns were generous portions, but pricing was a wee bit much IMHO at $7/each.  Our unanimous favorite was the shrimp bun.    Before the main courses were served, one of the staff came by with smaller bowls so we could all share the ramen.  My brother and I gave each other quizzical looks, and polite declined the offer, much to the surprise of the server.  As it turns out, we should have listened to him.  The ramen bowls look a bit deceiving since one could not imagine that it holds such a large quantity of food.  The ramen portion is extremely generous as it contains not only vegetables and a poached egg, but also pork belly AND shoulder.  Needless to say, my brother and I could not fathom finishing such a filling portion and were defeated in the end by our respective ramen bowls.  My mom, on the other hand, enjoyed her salmon sandwich immensely and finished it entirely.  SERVICE: Extremely efficient.  Our server was a very friendly and knowledgeable young lady.  With this being our first visit to MLV, she made some recommendations and patiently answered our menu questions.  She and other staff periodically checked on us throughout the meal, and we appreciated her efficiency and reliability.  BOTTOM LINE: A very filling meal at MLV.  Decent food portions, though the pricing for individual buns is questionable.  Thanks to the servers for providing exceptional customer service.  Lastly, if the staff recommend sharing a dish, please do take their advice!",

Not only was it overpriced for what we got, it was also nothing special. Also highly disappointing.   The $20 ramen was served in cheap takeout container. The broth tasted like straight up soy sauce. It was lukewarm, not even hot. And it tasted like something I can get at Chinatown for $10 back home in Philly.   The burrata was a tiny sauce container of cheese with a box of leaves. We paid $18 for a tiny 1oz container of fancy mozzarella cheese and leaves.  The only thing they got somewhat right was the pork bun. Nothing amazing, needs more toppings, but a huge cut of pork.",

The chilled noodles were good a level of spicy, probably more than the average person can handle. The noodles were topped with a spicy sauce, peppers, and ground pork.

We were initially a bit skeptical given the price tag and how similar fancy/chain restaurants in Vegas haven't lived up to expectations. However, both the service (speed), staff, and food were all very good. The bo ssam rice bowl was enough to fill you up and was very flavorful. The chickpea ramen was decent but my recommendation is to pass on the ramen if you have decent ones around where you live (Austin for instance). The family shared plates looked and smelled delicious but were a bit too expensive imo. Overall, I think it's a great place for either a quick lunch (affordable) or a more fancy dinner meal (can get $$$).",

    "text": "So it turns out I don't like Ramen (Don't shoot me).  But just because I didn't like the food, doesn't warrant a low rating.  The experience was fantastic.  It started off kind of scary - I had made a reservation for 1 pm on Open Table.  And at 10 am I missed a call from a 212 area code.  When I listened to the message I was shocked to hear that they were calling from Momofuku asking if I was still coming for my 1 pm seating - What?  It turns out that I made the reservation for a location in New York?  The guy on the phone said that I was not the only person from Canada that had that happen to them on Open Table and was really understanding.  So then I frantically called the CORRECT location and begged them for a table for 6 at 1 pm.  Everyone was so excited to go, I couldn't bare to tell them that I messed up the reservation.  Luckily, they had had a cancellation and there was room.  WOOHOO!  The appetizers were great.  We had the cauliflower & Brussel Sprouts, a few buns, and lamb ribs to start.  The cauliflower was amazing and I could have ordered that for my meal.  I tried the Shitaki buns which were also really good.  The lamb ribs were tasty, but not my favourite thing.  Like I said... it turns out that I'm not a fan of Ramen.  Although I tried a bite of the ginger scallion noodles and that really blew me away.  I should have ordered that!  It's a great atmosphere though.  Bright and open.  Very modern.  Cool Place!",

    "text": "Momofuku is one of many restaurants owned by the Momofuku group. I've heard of many of their restaurants and was quite excited to try the one here. We made reservations of around 10 for a friend's birthday on a Saturday.   +BRUSSEL SPROUTS & CAULIFLOWER: Comes with uni aioli and pomegranate seeds. They're a great contrast to how savory the brussel sprouts and cauliflower is. Great side item! -PORK RAMEN: To be fair, they do say that it's more of an American-style ramen. The broth wasn't creamy or that flavorful. However, there is a lot of meat in it, with the combination of pork belly and shoulder. The belly wasn't as soft as I normally like. Overall, this was just okay. -CHINESE BROCCOLI: This was alright, nothing too special and kind of basic. The portion of this is also really small, but understandable since it's listed as a side item.   It is to note that we came for dinner, and the ramen was not on the menu. However, it is on the lunch menu and you can ask them for the ramen options. You can still order it for dinner which is nice. They also have specials, which some of our group enjoyed. The waitress was curious on our input since she said they're considering it for the menu.  The service here is amazing, all due to our wonderful waitress. She was very friendly and made sure we had everything we needed. She was also quite honest with the menu, saying that the group meal option could feed more people than it listed. Furthermore, it was our friend's birthday so she got us a birthday cookie with a candle and ice cream (apparently, they just give you a cookie). She also suggested we take a picture on the balcony of the restaurant if no one was there. People ended up getting seated there so we opted for a group picture, which she grabbed a taller waiter to get all of us in it.   The staff here are wonderful, but I found some of the food to only be okay, though the brussel sprouts were great! Perhaps I ordered the wrong thing and I'd love to come back to try some of their other offerings.",

Hands-down one of the best buns I've had in my life. The experience didn't stop there. Following the buns were the lamb ribs. The perfect balance of flavors, and the meat slid right off the bone. I will definitely be returning to sample more items from the menu.",

It is only available for lunch (the full duck family meal is served at dinner). While the duck was good, it was not the same -- it was not stuffed with the pork sausage! Also, the pancakes were different. At Ssam Bar they are chive pancakes, where these were not as flavorful. It was also served with hoisin rather than the classic ssam sauce, which I asked for and received later. Also no spicy fingerling potatoes were offered as a side.  At $48 (Ssam Bar is $19!) they could have at least replicated it. I understand that the Cosmo's space is decidedly more expensive, so it was not about the price, it was about expectation. I expected the duck ssam of Ssam Bar.  David Chang has been famous for -- and I might add a little pretentious for taking things off the menu when they get too popular -- the Brussels sprouts are a classic example. But even Chang would not dare take the pork buns off of Momofuku  Noodle Bar nor the duck ssam off of Momofuku Ssam Bar because his customers would just simply go away. If you are going to serve something, like perhaps the greatest duck dish I have ever had next to the ethereal duck confit at Thomas Keller's Bouchon, you don't screw with it!",

    "text": "Momofuku was a memorable experience, and 90% of that was service from the kitchen staff. My party of 4 sat at the kitchen bar, which is one of fav places to sit in a restaurant. You really get to see the ACTION, as well as interact with the chefs (as long as they're not too swamped). Anyhoo, we ordered the shoyu pork ramen. The broth was fresh, deep umami flavor. Didn't have the heavy slick of a tonkatsu broth (duh they're 2 diff things but let me state the obvious here!) The noodles had the 'pang' of a good quality nood. The pork belly was charred well where you get a slight crunch when u bite into the fat. It also came with a shredded pork. I usually am not a pork fan, I usually find it smelly. But it was good here! Nicely salted. The cucumbers were crunchy and fresh, it cut thru the saltiness of the broth really well. We also had the potatoes, imo they were just ok. But I'm not a huge fried potato fan, but the fry on the half cut whole rainbow potatoes were nice. Very crunchy! If you like fried potatoes, get this. It came w spicy fried garlic and honey mustard.   Ok so now to the good part. The chef in front of us was prepping items for dinner service, but he was SO polite! He answered all my foodie questions, \"what r u gonna do with those radishes?\", \"What'd u do with the scrapes?\", \"What are the 3 kinds of noodles u have?\". Omggg. He even brought out a plate of the 3 noodle types he had to show me the differences!! He could've easily ignored me but his kindness made my experience at momofuku. I'd go back, knowing the amount of care the chefs put into their dishes and customers. Sadly the chefs dont receive a portion of the tips. So, keep that in mind if you want to cash out the chefs",

The chickpeas makes it filling which other vegetarian dishes sometimes do not. I know people love the pork belly bun but I found it overwhelming of one flavor. The meat portion of the bun is hearty though. Ashley our bartender was a sweetheart.",

I found the standard ramen and I found the flavor in the broth really lacking, not to mention it was $17. Waiters are very friendly however devious. While they keep your glasses filled with still water, they do charge you for it. This is unacceptable unless you are given a heads up. Not only do they charge you a dollar per person the receipt says you are getting premium water when it is just a bottle refilled with tap water. These practices must be brought to light and stopped!   Experience: 1/5 Food: 3/5 Service: 1/5 Price: $$$",

    "text": "Momofuku is definitely an Asian restaurant, I'm not sure why Yelp categorizes it as American...? Most of the food here was great and flavorful, but the prices are too steep for what you get. I guess everything in Vegas is just super inflated....  We ordered a pork bun for each person at our table and it wasn't worth the $7 price that we paid. It was good but underwhelming for what you get. I've had better Pork Belly baos.   We also ordered 2 Pork Ramens for the table to share. It came covered in green onions and mixed greens which was overwhelming for me. The Pork Ramen here was just a very interesting combination of flavors for me and the broth was too salty for my taste. Overall, very confusing bowl of ramen in terms of ingredients included.  For the fancier folk. the Truffle Ramen is available and it's worth a try, but paying $50 for a bowl of ramen is VERY steep and I doubt I would order it again. So for all you truffle lovers, this one is definitely for you.    If you're dining with a larger party, I recommend getting their Bossam, which is Braised Pork Belly served with butter lettuce, oysters, kimchi, ginger green onion sauce, hoisin and their house sauce. The way they prepare their pork is different than other Korean restaurants because it's not boiled down then sliced. It arrives at your table in all of it's 2 pound glory, smothered in sauce and served with tongs for shredding. Yes it's 2 lbs so it's more than enough food for 5-6 people, even 8 people if you're ordering other items on the menu. I do recommend getting it for larger parties because it racks up to be about $130+ for one order. This was probably the best thing I ate that day and I would come back just to eat this with my group, but probably nothing else.",

Presentation was nice but as soon as I took the first spoonful of broth, it was on the bland side. Decent size of pork belly but smaller than I'm use to portion of noodles. Being from Hawaii, ramen is one of our staple foods. From prepackaged frozen noodles to dried noodles in packets. I've had more flavorful ramen from some of these $1.79 packets of ramen back home. Me and my girlfriend struggled to finish eating our bowls because of how lackluster the flavor was. Definitely won't be returning to eat here my next time in Vegas.   Other than the food, the service was alright. I wouldn't say it was spectacular but just normal service from any restaurant on the strip.",

    "text": "Wow. We had lunch here and ordered a bunch of things to share and try. We started with the crispy potatoes. You might assume as we did they'd be regular old side of fried potatoes. Nope. These were like potatoes that went away to college and came back changed for the better. A bit of honey and mustard with crispy fried garlic made these spuds addictively good. Every bite was tasty and it was a nice counterpoint to the other dishes. We also tried the two buns on the menu. One shrimp and a pork bun. Super solid so really no surprise there..  I preferred the shrimp but they were both equally good. I added a bit of their Saam sauce for extra spice. Nice. Then the Shoyu Pork ramen arrived.. This is what I'd been looking forward to. (We've been to the NYC Momofuku for ramen and really enjoyed it. Headed to Majordomo in LA hopefully soon..) This ramen had Pork shoulder AND Pork Belly in addition to a perfectly soft boiled egg, nori, sprouts etc. The noodles were firm and the broth was savory and had such a pleasant savory flavor. (It was also 105 degrees outside in Vegas but I just didn't care! Thanks AC.) Lastly, the Jidori chicken Saam arrived. Honestly, our small family of three could've split this entree for lunch. Piping hot Jidori chicken with lettuce wraps, a bit of kimchi and garlic/ginger/scallion rice. We were delighted making little lettuce wraps with the well spiced and slightly charred chicken with the kimchi. I literally couldn't stop eating it and had the rest wrapped to go. I ate it later that night and enjoyed it all over again. Cheap? No. Deliciously awesome food and great service? Yes!!",

It's pretty hard to find a ramen place that's vegetarian friendly since the broth is usually made with pork, but Momofuku has an option for those of us who don't eat pork!   The chickpea ramen was delicious. It comes with scallions, chickpea miso, bok choy, and crispy chickpeas on top. The different textures worked well together and the broth was so incredibly flavorful. A very satisfying bowl of ramen and the price was decent for Vegas- $16 plus tax.   Service was fairly quick and the food came out in a timely manner. Although this may be the case at many restaurants, outside alcoholic beverages aren't allowed so don't bring a 100 oz Fat Tuesday and expect them to let you in with it.  Momofuku is located on the second floor of the cosmopolitan, right next to Milk.",

    "text": "David Chang's Momofuku is arguably one of America's best restaurants right now. Originally opened over ten year's ago in New York's East Village, the Vegas outpost of Momofuku is the chef's first western expansion.  I first came to know of David Chang on one of the Anthony Bourdain shows. I immediately knew that if he was good enough for Anthony Bourdain, he was good enough for me. I've since watched him on the Netflix show The Mind of a Chef, where he travels and makes cuisines from all over the world. His menus draw inspiration from near and far including Korea, Japan, and the USA.   The constantly evolving menu at Momofuku features steamed buns, noodles, and meat and seafood meant for sharing. On a recent visit I had both the pork and shrimp buns for an appetizer and really enjoyed these. The side sauce that accompanies these really helped to enhance the flavor.  For my main course I ordered the pork ramen. I was especially fond of the coddled egg in the ramen, cooked perfectly within the flavorful broth. The noodles were done just right and not gummy or overcooked, although that should be the norm and nothing surprising in a place like this.  My only complaint was that the amount of sodium in the dish was overwhelming. Hopefully this will get resolved as Chef Chang and his team continue to evolve the flavors and methods used in making the broth.   The interior of the restaurant is trendy and modern industrial. There's a lovely view of the Strip on one side where the majority of the tables are, and then two bars: one for noodles and one for drinks. The highlight for me is the Dave Choe artwork that adorns the western wall of the main sitting room. During your meal you can look at this and enjoy a little Black Sabbath soundtrack playing over the loud speakers.  You'll find Momofuku in Vegas at the Cosmopolitan, with its sister dessert sidekick Milk Bar right next door. My feelings on Milk are mixed (read my review) but my feelings on Momofuku are that it is putting out some of the best ramen that I've had anywhere.",

We saw that there was an open reservation on OpenTable right before the show so it was perfect timing. We were seated promptly after checking in with the host. We told our servers that we were in a rush so she assured that we would make our show on time.   We ordered the bucatini, chilled spicy noodles, and 2 pork belly buns. The pork belly buns were literal perfection. The pork belly is seasoned extremely well. The ssam sauce was a great addition, and it was not that spicy. It was tangier than I thought it would be. The bucatini was really decadent. The hozon taste is prevalent the moment you put it in your mouth. I feel like you really have to be in the mood for the bucatini. The chilled spicy noodles were unexpected. The combination of the sichuan sausage and cashews were a superb pair. They were really only spicy if you eat the cut chilis.   When we were done with the show, we realized that we could not get our mind off the pork belly buns. So, we went back to Momofuku and were seated at the bar. It was really awesome to see the chefs at work. It was a cool experience! We decided to get two more pork belly buns and each ordered shoyu pork ramen. I usually do not like soy sauce broths for my ramen, but it was well done. The pork shoulder and belly is an excellent spotlight for this ramen dish. I definitely recommend it for anyone who is craving some ramen in Vegas.",

    "text": "A very trendy spot inside the Cosmopolitan Hotel. This location is easily three times the size of any of the NYC Momo restaurants, and the food is intended for big groups.  I remember 4 distinct parts to the menu - appetizers, small plates, plates for 2 - 3, and plates for 4 - 6. Everything is priced at the group rate. Also, note that in Las Vegas, 2 dollar signs is actually 3 dollar signs.   For a group of 6, we were recommended to order at least one main ( 4- 6) and a couple small plates (2-3). It is really difficult if you haven't been here before to know if that is truly enough food. We ended up ordering 4 items - the burrata and pear salad, the ginger and scallion noodles, salt and pepper lobster and shrimp, and the 5 spice duck. It was more than enough food. We probably could have cut out the burrata or the noodles ( not because they didn't taste delicious) but because by the time the duck came, we were all pretty full.  It's not just the fact that the plates are shareable, it is also that each dish is a flavor bomb and it is better to err on the side of ordering conservatively so that you can truly enjoy each dish.  I highly recommend ordering all of the 4 dishes stated above. The 5 spice duck is an experience - and it is done in two parts, no duck is wasted or left behind. It also comes with lettuce, ginger flavored wraps, a couple dipping sauces and is served on a bed of ginger scallion rice. I know they told me all this before I ordered, but they were not exaggerating, it is a lot of food.",

Ordered: A. ginger scallion noodles - quite good, a little oily but overall tasty B. pork ramen - I do think the ramen is nothing out of the ordinary, but in my opinion, it seems people judge it more harshly based on the price, which isn't exactly fair because you're on the strip in Vegas..what are you expecting to spend at an established restaurant? It tastes fine and better than other reviews indicate C. shrimp bun - most unique item we tried - had two of them and enjoyed this the most :) D. pork belly bun - same pork used in the ramen, also good but not as unique   Looking at the pictures, the salt and pepper lobster and shrimp looks like a winner and worth trying but I knew there wasn't enough room to try everything - gotta try the ramen at Momofuku no matter what - even if people are negative about it. Good choice for lunch or late night snacking!",

    "text": "Watching so many vids and documentaries on David Chang's restaurants, I was pretty excited to check out Momofuku in Cosmo...but unfortunately, I would say this is a try one-time type of place for me.  While the food was A-OK, it wasn't mind-blowing - and with those menu prices, there were expectations for wow factors on the items. We had a very large party of 19 and we reserved a long table that was able to seat all of us comfortably in their super comfy seats.  The interior of Momofuku was quite large with clean/simple decor.  Service was good and food came out fairly quickly considering our group size.  Only thing I would recommend to fix is for the waiters to announce to the guests that the default water given to them is some \"filtered\" tap water that's supposed to cleanse the pallet better (or some mumbo jumbo); there is an automatically charge of $1/guest on it.  Regular tap is free, and what we assumed we would be getting, but nope.  Not a big price at all but not a fan of surprise charges (even though it was in fine print on the menu; didn't see).  The food - I ordered the Pork Shoyu Ramen, the Ginger Scallion Noods, the Shiitake Bun, and the Pork Belly Bun.  The Pork Belly in the ramen and bun were pretty good, and the egg in the ramen was cooked well...but aside from that, the ramen tasted quite regular and the broth wasn't super flavorful.  The Ginger Scallion Noods were pretty good, with all the ingredients mixed nicely.  The ramen and buns were a bit pricier than I thought it was worth.  Ginger beer was also $6!  The table also ordered some shared dishes like the Five-Spice Duck and the Pork Shoulder.  I didn't try it, but they said that while the duck was good, it wasn't anything better than Sam Woo, but at a super premium cost.  The Pork Shoulder was good - they said it would feed 3-4 people...nope - it feeds much, much more.  I'd guess 6+, esp if you're ordering other stuff.  Additionally, since we were there for some birthdays, they did offer some tasty cake balls and a birthday candle for them, so that was a nice gesture.  I do love watching the shows on David Chang's restaurants, but this one was just okay for us.  I would recommend you give it a try as they do have some unique items you won't really find across the Vegas strip.  They also have the famous Milk dessert bar right outside the restaurant if you want to get some Crack Pie or Compost Cookies!",

The fried chicken was so soft, moist, and flavorful. Perfect.  - I loved the brussels sprouts  Cons: - The pork ramen was way too heavy. The whole thing tasted like pork grease. The noodles by themselves were excellent, tho. Cooked perfectly and great texture and chewiness. - The pork buns had too much of whatever sauce and was really sweet. I suppose many Americans would like it. - They gave us separate checks for our party of 10 and it was a disaster. They basically randomly combined ordered into random checks and we couldnt figure it out. For example, I got a ramen and a bun. My buddy to my right got ramen, bun, and a beer. One of the checks was two ramens and a bun. Then his beer got on someone else's check. His bun was on yet another person's check. Then we had a check that had partial orders from 4 diff people.",

We walked right in and received a table. We informed our server we were there just before a concert. He took our order quickly and the food seemed to arrive immediately. We were very appreciate of his quick response and delivery.  We loved the quick walk from the T-Mobile Arena. On a concert or game night this spot is a short walk from the bustling Arena-area. Those dining spots were telling us 60-90 minute waits. We were able to make it down to the restaurant, eat and walk back in just over one hour.   I have to dock them a star for the prices. Yeah, I know they occupy expensive landscape on the strip, but the prices are high for what you get. Their portions are small so you are not going to leave stuffed.

Pork belly bao is yummy but not extraordinary (try it if you never had a bao). The soft boiled eggs with ikura and watercress were sooo good, the sauce completed the appetizer for us.   As for main courses, my two favorites were the spicy Sichuan rice cakes and steamed mussels.    Usually not a big fan of Korean rice cakes but they pan fried the rice cakes, so it's crispy on the outside and soft in the inside. Super spicy if you are a mild type of person.   Steamed mussels were great! Not over-cooked and all the mussels had just opened up. Flavor of the sauce was great too!!   The fried brussel sprouts were slightly disappointing because it wasn't crispy like EMC's fried brussel sprouts. A little bit too sweet for the sauce as well and not crispy enough.   The smothered chicken katsu was really yum but because it was a cream dish, it was a little bit too heavy for me.   We also had a complimentary hamachi sashimi dish compliments of the chef! Thank you so much!!! It was really refreshing with the ponzu sauce, citric, and herb oil!!   We also ordered a crack pie (yum) and cereal milk soft serve (so good!! It reminds me of Horlick soft serve for all the Asian kids) It was me and my friends bday so they gave us complimentary birthday truffles.  Thank you so much!!",

    "text": "Simply WOW! I've always wanted to go to Momofuku in New York and was excited to be able to check the restaurant out on a recent business trip to Las Vegas.  I was lucky to score a bar seat in front of the kitchen as it afforded me the opportunity to chat with the chefs and get their recommendations on dishes. I also benefited by sitting next to a guy who was happy to trade bites of each other's dishes so that I could taste more things.  I was tempted to order the Pork Ramen, but was worried it would be too filling. Apparently each of the Momofuku restaurants has several dishes created specifically for that particular restaurant, and there are classic dishes, such as the Ramen, available at all locations.  I ended up ordering, or tasting the following dishes:  Spicy cucumbers with togarashi, toasted almonds and scallions. The cucumbers were served in large chunks and came with a light, spicy sauce.   Shrimp bun. You can't go to Momofuku and have at least one bun. I'm not a big meat eater, but was willing to try the Pork belly bun. The chef recommended the shrimp and shiitake buns, and so I ordered the Shrimp bun and was blown away by it. The shrimp was crispy, spicy, perfectly cooked and piping hot. I loved it! I'll try the Shiitake bun the next time.  Romaine salad with parmesan, walnut and tamarind. What a salad!! It sounds so simple and basic, but it wasn't. It probably is the best romaine salad I've had anywhere. The dressing, favors and consistency were unlike any Romaine salad I've ever had before. I loved it.  Smothered Katsu chicken with shiitake gravy and black pepper. This dish was incredible. The chicken was hot, crunchy and bursting with flavor. So good!  Salt & Pepper lobster with shrimp, jalapeno and fried garlic. Another incredible dish. It's not cheap, but definitely worth it.  Lastly, I tried the Korean braised short ribs. This dish is large and designed to serve 2-8 people. The piece of beef was HUGE, but cooked to perfection with incredible flavor. The meat is slow cooked over night and was unbelievably tender.  A shout out to the chefs for their great recommendations and conversation during dinner. One was a talented, bright, personable guy from San Jose (sorry, I am bad with names), and the other a young woman from the Pacific Northwest. Both were incredible skilled, dedicated and passionate about their profession.  I can't wait to go back to Las Vegas so that I can return to Momofuku and try more dishes. I would highly recommend eating at this restaurant.",

    "text": "It's hard to review this place if you're well-versed in multiple Asian cuisines. Especially when you can find inexpensive, delicious Asian food just down the street on Spring Mtn (Las Vegas' Chinatown). I must say though, I'm a fan of David Chang's new spot on The Strip.  If you love subtle, inquisitive flavors, this place is for you. Exemplary of this are the Beets and the Ginger Scallion Noodles. As you eat the beets, there's this hint of spiciness from the XO sauce opposite the citrus mandarins. The ginger scallion noodles were surprisingly refreshing and a great compliment to the other dishes with richer flavors. The food is delicious, but find it hard to justify an $18 bowl of ramen; however, it is flavorful & has a lighter broth than traditional tonkotsu ramen, w/ subtle tastes of kahlua pork.  MUST ORDER: CRACK PIE - trust me on this. It's not expensive and it's grub.  The majority of the 4 stars is attributed to their service staff - they make you feel at home and at ease while giving you that impeccable service.  Tips: * Expect to spend a lot. Yes, their prices seem reasonable but they're small portions. And we're on The Strip at Cosmo.  * Make sure to order dessert - CRACK PIE.  * If you can afford it w/ your group, order the Spicy Cod & Chili Donabae. It's $248, but it's huge and delicious if you like spicy food. Lots and lots of cod too.  * Sometimes Chef David Chang is in the restaurant. We were lucky he was in when we went. Don't be shy to ask your server for a selfie w/ David Chang.  * If you want a sweet snack and don't want to eat at the restaurant, check out Momofuku Milk Bar next door. You can order their crack pie and their various soft serves which are delicious.",

    "text": "David CHANG's Greatest Hits!  Like the music artists who put out one of those compilations for big money but no creative sweat so Momofuku LV hits the strip food scene.  We have been to two of the NYC venues and rabid fans so we are a bit biased.  Atmospherics are all LV hip.  You could drop any big name chef and change the sign in front and start rolling with evening service.  Thumpy uber soundtrack, cool interiors, hip staff and even more hipster floor overseers all make things work.  Our server was knowledgeable, energetic and bubbly.  They all worked seamlessly together and I counted 4 managers who made sure everything was cool.  One overseer dude passed our table every 8 minutes as he panned and scanned the room.   \"Leave no empty wine glass behind\" is their service motto.  Bravo. They got it down par excellence! Food was also right up there with Mr. Chang's vision execution.   Hot hot, cold cold, crispy crispy.  The Bao's all yummy, especially liked the chicken karaage one. Super crisp and light.  He added a app sized fried chicken, Truffle creme and caviar for $48.  Three petite strips of super yummy chook goodness.  Easily the star of the starters.  Truffle Ramen was not smoking hot so a bit off for us.   I would make it a point to make sure the server expresses this out of the kitchen and you be prepared  to scarf it quick.  Minimize your food Porn shots and eat while the heat activates the truffles.  If you are a party of 4 or more there are some large format entrees like his rotisserie duck that are fabulous but you need to plan ahead and even order in advance.  The big winner entrees are here so go find some friends.  Bar and wine list back up the food to the same degree of thoughtfulness.  Mr. Chang is known for being a eclectic culinary maestro with a irreverent look on life.  While what he really should be respected for is being leader of passionate abilities that has created a cadre of culinary and service professionals that deliver memorable dining experiences.  LV peach brings to the West Coast a bit of all his learnings executed by a core team of his tribe of peach peeps.   Actually 4.5 stars with the last .5 attainable once they find their own identity and peach edginess.    Long live the Peach!",

    "text": "After stopping in a couple times, I can say that Momofuku might have the best ramen bowl that I've ever had, but it isn't the ramen dish that they are most known for. Before we get to that, let's cover the basics. The vibe is super trendy, with the bar right in front playing hip-hop tunes; an open kitchen with counter seating; and a dining area with dark leather, light woods, and modern murals. The service was good on both visits, but a little uneven; at times it was impeccable, but other times it ranged from overly enthusiastic to missing in action.  The plates at Momofuku are as much art as they are food. Every dish that we've eaten has been beautifully presented. They are just as delicious as they are pretty. The heirloom tomato salad and the spicy cucumbers were both standout first dishes; the tomatoes were bright with citrus notes and the cucumbers were crispy and fresh with the perfect amount of heat. I wasn't crazy about the dry roasted mussels. They were tasty, but dry. I really wished that there had been some sort of sauce or, at a minimum, a drizzle of butter. The chilled spicy noodles were definitely spicy, but not chilled; more like room temperature. They had a bright basil flavor with a nice kick of heat when I got a slice of pepper or a nice bit of sweetness when I got a candied cashew. The Sichuan sausage served over the top of them was good, but slightly undercooked for my taste and not broken down small enough; trying to break up Italian-meatball sized chunks of sausage with my chopsticks was irritating. Now, about the ramen; the pork belly ramen is a fantastic dish that you will NOT be disappointed with. The pork belly and shredded pork shoulder combined with the poached egg are wonderfully rich and just make for a luscious bowl of noodles. But if you want the best bowl of ramen that you'll ever have, order the chickpea ramen. This dish is incredible; the interplay of textures will delight your palate and the depth of flavor will make you wonder what sort of sorcery they are practicing in the kitchen to elevate such a simple dish to this level. It is a masterpiece. I wish I could say the same about the world famous Crack Pie from Milk Bar. We ordered it with cereal milk ice cream and we were sorely disappointed with everything about it from the texture (dense) to the taste (bland).",

Water came out next, then our menus, and they explained the menu. 5 of us ordered bowls of ramen, the other 3 opted for family style dining.  A round of pork belly buns for the 8 of us. It was so delicious and yummy , the pork belly was super tender and the sauce rounded it out. It was gone in seconds.  I'm assuming the ramen was good as the 5 who ordered the ramen slurped them down. I will need to come back and try it. For the family style dining, we had the salt and pepper shrimp and lobster and the bo ssam. We were able to to do half orders of them, the shrimp and lobster tails were lightly fried with onion and garlic and chilies. Delicious, lobster definitely fresh and tender. The fried onions, garlic and chilies were very well with the rice, we liked it so much we had that packed..... the Bus boy gave us  a weird look! The bo ssam was very different from what I've before. Huge chunk of meat that is super tender and you tear it up, wrap in lettuce and add the accompanying sauces to it and a raw oyster to it. It was good, different with the oysters but delicious none the less. It tasted even better the next day. Christina our waitress was a doll! Good food and great service, now I want ramen.....",

My boyfriend and I decided to make a reservation on Open Table on a whim and check it out for a late lunch on a Saturday afternoon. We rushed to make it in time and when we got there after 30 minutes of powerwalking, the restaurant was nearly empty. So much for feeling lucky that we got a last minute reservation!   We ordered the pork bun, pork belly ramen, and the vegetable rice cakes. The food was good but not exceptional the way that I was expecting it to be. The piece of pork in the bun and in the ramen were BIG. The thick slab of it was fantastic.  The rice cakes were cooked well and the flavors were interesting and unique, but the mushrooms overpowered the taste of it and I wasn't a huge fan... too many mushrooms is too earthy!  The service was good and the wait staff was attentive. Ultimately, we had a good first experience but I don't plan on returning because once here is enough for me.",

I went there fairly late and order the pork ramen, the egg was perfectly soft boiled, the pork was tender and crispy while smoky and crispy on the outer layer. And the broth had so much depth.  Definitely recommend if you want that authentic Japanese ramen style. I provided an empty bowl pic so you can try it out.",

I'm feeling extra generous on my score because the food was so darn good - but the prices here are out of this world expensive. That being said, it was also very very tasty.  We ordered the five spice duck, the tuna/foie gras, the uni hashbrown, the pork belly bun and the apple crisp salad. I also had 2 drinks: the negroni and the old fashioned.  Every single dish was incredible and made to perfection. The pork belly bun is now my favorite in town, the uni hashbrown is now a contender for my favorite all time dish, and the duck was also probably one of the best Chinese duck I've ever had.  That being said, we left paying $450+ which is far too much. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt because it was Valentine's day and it was so darn tasty. But gosh, even for Vegas those prices are a bit ridiculous.",

( nothing special) Sounded good but wouldn't order it again.  Pork belly ramen was tasty but not a standout compared to most ramen restaurants. It was super cold that night so it really hit the spot for a bowl of hot noodle soup!  Lastly, we ordered the Chinese broccoli as an accompaniment. We really enjoyed the twist to this otherwise common Chinese side-dish. The dish had a bit of zested lemon, sprinkle of sesame seeds , and the traditional oyster sauce drizzle. Loved the combination of flavors.  Service was efficient and the server was very nice.",

Well, not only did I get in on opening night, we were their first customers AND I got to meet David Cheng.  The entire meal and service was perfect. All of the staff was so extremely professional and pleasant. They gave us complimentary champagne for being the first customers. They were attentive and really just thought of everything.  As for the food, it was delicious. We tried the cucumber salad, Kimchi stew, Branzino, and crack pie for dessert and a few cocktails. Everything was perfect.   The restaurant is modern and fun with good strip view and not overcrowded seating which is a plus. We cannot wait to go back.",

Hands down one of the saltiest ramen bowls I have ever had. The pork belly slice was a bit undercooked for my taste. If I am gonna eat that much fat, I want it to at least have some good flavor.   The gua bao was average. Seemed like the kitchen was trying to recreate a recipe and halfassed it. They put this sour/spicy vinegar based ssam bar bbq sauce on the table for your bun almost to try and mask the fact that the pork bun was mass created and attention to detail or unique flavors lost in the sea of people they have to serve in this giant restaurant.  All in all it all seemed, as David Chang loves to say \"tremendous.\" Tremendously underwhelming, and if we are talking about the ramen tremendously salty.   This Vegas chain screams tourist money grab. Honestly my personal opinion is that momofuku shouldn't be serving ramen or gua bao because I would hate for someone who has never had either to come eat this and think that this is what it is supposed to taste like.",

    "text": "Buns are delicious. Lamb and the crispy potato were mediocre at best. I have never tasted a crispy Patato that is so not crispy. The lamb claimed to be Sichuan flavor but missing the key flavor of numbness. Might as well renamed as spicy lamb. Also some lamb pieces were too spicy and some were not spicy at all. It could meant that they did not spread the sauce evenly.   But the one star is for the services. I finished two delicious buns and hands were greasy. I realized we didn't have the napkins. I asked the waitress for napkins. The waitress came back and told us they are out of napkins. I spent $100 in a restaurant in a five star hotel and you told me you are out of napkins. Are you f**king kidding me??? I said, I don't have anything to clean my hands! She didn't say a word then she left. Then she went to grab me the paper napkins. At that time I can only sit there helplessly with my greasy hands and staring my next dish because I wanted to take a picture b4 eating and I couldn't! . And I saw other guests came in after me are happily using napkins. It made me angrier. Later I asked my waiter. It turned out they do have napkins. They said it's a miscommunication. I am not sure if it's a staff training problem, waitress problem, communication problem or whatever problem. It's not MY problem!  I have never asked for napkins and not given one, not even in the cheap street stalls or ANY restaurant, literally ANY restaurant. They need to do a better job for sure.   However besides that waitress, our waiters have been lovely.  ------------------------ Update:  The manager, Ryan, contacted me right away and said he will look into this and this is not common practice there. Hopefully they will do better. After all, the buns are delicious! Changed to three stars.",

For appetizers we had the shrimp bun which was savory and a little sweet, we tried the mussels which were a different taste than typical mussels but still delightful, and the baked oysters (I hate raw oysters but cooked these were not slimy and the bacon flavor hit the spot). For entrees we got the wagyu filet mignon-great flavor, perfectly cooked, tender, and the sauce was a great touch. We also ordered the pommes puree which is pureed potatoes and they are so creamy, buttery and mouthwatering, the Brussel sprouts were salty with what tasted like vinegar and probably the best Brussels sprouts I've ever had! The green beans were tossed with a spicy but sweet sauce and a great additional to our entree. For dessert we tried the crack pie (which I wasn't too fond of), the birthday cake truffle which was my favorite, the cereal milk ice cream which was crazy because it taste just like cereal milk after breakfast! I def would recommend stopping in and trying this place out!",

Unfortunately, this is a story of disappointment.   While the decor is amazing and the staff courteous, there is much to be desired here. Upon entering the establishment, the service is great with attentive staff and ample seating. This was lunch time on a weekday and there wasn't much traffic, with nearly 70% of the location being empty. Securing our orders was quick and easy, but this is where the quality of the experience drops.   The Chinese buns ordered took quite a bit of time to arrive, but even worse yet was the ramen. I'm not sure what their process is, but it wasn't busy and they had plenty of staff available in their open kitchen, yet it took nearly 20 minutes for the ramen to make its way to the table. What was sad is that it tasted terrible. The broth was bland and the noodles were soggy.   Although I wish I could say that the Chickpea ramen that was ordered was a fluke, the bland and soggy trend continued to its pork broth offering as well. Sadly, I hope that this is an off encounter, but when you're spending quite a bit on a meal and its poor, you just don't really feel the need to ever return.   In hindsight, if the moment could have been re-lived, I'd probably order buns for takeout (if that is an option). They are excellent. But, I don't think I'll ever take a chance on this location again.",

Overall, I would have to say that the dishes were on the saltier side and were just mediocre. There was nothing too special about it. For dessert, I ordered the crack pie a la mode. The pie was on the sweeter side, however, mixed with the cereal flavored ice cream and the cornflakes at the side, it was a good combination of salty and sweet.",

The decor in Momofuku is hip and we were seated quickly. Our server was nice although she wasn't too knowledgable about food items or the drinks. The \"pickled\" cucumbers had a very off-putting taste and the taste of raw onions just lingers on you palette. The baos were hands down the highlight of our meal, although the fried chicken baos we didn't care for to much. They weren't crispy and overall a bit bland. HOWEVER, the pork belly baos with quick pickled onions and the shiitake baos (these babies straight up tasted like meat!) were DELICIOUS so don't pass those up! The ramen and cold noodles were super bland and nothing special and the soft serve dessert was nothing to rave about as well. We had high hopes for this place but it just missed the mark.",

    "text": "Absolutely try Momofuku while in Las Vegas! Yes, several dishes are substantially overpriced, but the quality of the meat and flavor of the dishes makes it worth a stop. The pork belly bao is a must - the pork melts in your mouth. I also recommend the ground shrimp bao, it has great flavor. The spicy cucumber starter is lovely, not too large, and the kimchi tastes great. My favorite noodle is the spicy noodles - the pork sausage was very flavorful, the spinach pesto tasted great, and the spice level is perfect! I know in the past people have complained about the dish being too spicy, so Momofuku lowered the heat a few notches to cater to more guests pallets. If you have the time, I recommend popping out and ordering from Milk as well. Unless you know what you want while still in the restaurant, its worth sampling the soft serve flavors and checking out all the baked good options in person! So yummy and a classic!",

The service was actually the best part of the meal, our server was super friendly and knowledgeable, and the other staff member gave us some incredible dessert recs. We ordered family style with the karaage bao (must try), the fried crab bao, ramen, and a bunch of other things. My least favorite main was the ramen- pretty meh in my book. And favorite was the scallop poke- small portion but mind blowingly good. Dessert we tried all the things but the crack cake and cereal milk ice cream were on point. Seven spice slushie was ok- but was jealous of my friends elderflower selection :) One star off for some strangely high priced dishes and disproportionate portions.",

My friend orders the Crack Pie as Momofuku is associated with the adjacent Milk ice creamery and dessert bar. She enjoyed the dessert while I continued to pretend to be vegan.

He had a great personality that made the whole experience that much better. We got two of the family style specials, see picture.   Everything was absolutely fantastic from the get go. Had the Shishito Peppers & Pork meatballs to start. For the main course we shared the Bo Ssam and the Korean Braised Short Ribs.   To our waiter Manny - YOU ROCK! Thanks guys for an amazing meal!",

    "text": "Hype, hype, hype.  It all adds up to expectations not being met.  David Chang is one of my personal food heroes and having an opportunity to eat at Momofuku while in Las Vegas was one I wasn't going to miss.  The place is handsome, glitzy and very Asian in that there are lots of Asians around, eating, serving, bartending, cooking.  The bar has a very casual vibe and the drinks have Asian touches.  Nice.  The kitchen is open and in view from the bar and restaurant area.  The menu is expansive.  There are are small plates, medium plates, and monster plates made for sharing.  Our group was large enough to try a number of plates of all sizes.   We asked for recommendations from our server and added a few things of our own.  It all added up to waaay too much food!  And because the large format items come at the end, we were faced with a huge amount of additional food when we were already full!  I think our server should have been more cautionary with us in our ordering because at the end it was not very enjoyable.  Shrimp buns: Fried shrimp cake on steamed buns with Asian accoutrements.  Tasty but the steamed buns were not the softest.  Ginger scallion noodles: This is a David Chang staple and I have to admit it was disappointing.  The noodles were soft and the the ginger scallion sauce was lost in an overdose of the sweet pickled shiitakes.  Shisito peppers: Can't go wrong with these and they were appropriately delicious.  Rotisserie chicken and fried bones: This is a roast chicken with crispy skin, served with chicken parts that are fried until crispy.  Dry and dry.  Not good.  Bo Ssam: Another of chef's famous dishes, it's a large format, whole or 1/2 pork shoulder, braised and roasted until fork tender, and served with raw oysters, sauces, and lettuce leaves for wrapping.  We ordered the 1/2 shoulder and it was still an intimidating amount of food.  Delicious!  5 spice roasted duck:  This AWESOME version of roast duck is also served as a large format, and can easily feed 8+ people.  The legs and thighs are removed and the bone-in breast is spit roasted until the skin is golden brown and beautifully crispy.  Meanwhile a confit is made from the legs and thighs which is then shredded and brought to the table and served over a large serving bowl of rice.  The whole roasted duck breast is then brought to the table, taken off the bone and carved table side; the perfectly cooked breast slices are then placed atop the confit/rice.  Wow, so delicious!  Oh, and then the duck carcass is taken back to the kitchen, chopped up and fried until crisp, and then brought back out to the table for some additional snacking.   Soooo good.  Like a lot of Las Vegas outposts, Momofuku does not meet the hype however if you come for the duck you will not be disappointed!",

    "text": "Momofuku is located on the second floor of The Cosmopolitan Hotel on The Strip. I made an 8:30 pm reservation for dinner on a Saturday. Our table was ready by 8:35 pm. I was very impressed with the venue. The restaurant was much bigger than I expected and I was seated in a quieter back room with a beautiful view of the 'Eiffel Tower' and Paris Tower. I found the service to be excellent. There was a server specifically assigned to remove dishes and fill water glasses. I don't think I ever had a water glass that was less than half full. The only issue was when bringing out our main dishes a server accidentally placed them on a neighboring table. Realizing the mistake he immediately took the dishes back to the kitchen and put in a rushed reorder. So it took a little longer than average to get the food. However, the servers explained and genuinely apologized for their mistake. They also comped us their crispy potatoes and market greens small plates without us having to ask!! Overall, environment was excellent, service was outstanding, and food was great. Five stars earned without contest.   Food Reviews:  Small plates:  'Market Greens': this item was complimentary due to the situation described above. It included cauliflower and Brussels sprouts roasted in an Asian-inspired marinade, topped with apples. It was great for being a plate of vegetables, but it didn't stand apart as unique. I wouldn't order this myself.   'Crispy Potatoes': this item was also complimentary. It included 'bite-sized' potatoes, ham, and seasoning, topped upon delivery by server with a unique Momofuku cheese sauce. This dish was heavy, but extremely good. If you're super hungry, I'd recommend getting this appetizer. I would order this small plate again.   'Sichuan Lamb Ribs': this was actually my first time eating both Ribs and Lamb so I don't have much to compare this dish to. But the ribs were melt in your mouth quality and very well marinated. Excellent dish, but very fatty. This is also a very filling plate. I personally wouldn't describe it as a small plate. Would be filling as an entree.   'Black Truffle Ramen': I ordered this dish first and foremost to try truffles. Again, it was my first time eating truffles so I don't have much to compare to. But this dish was excellent. The Ramen broth heavily over-shined the noodles. Truffles and egg yolk gave the ramen a powerful and satisfying flavor. If you like truffles, you'll like this dish.   'Crispy Unagi': I saved this for last as it was actually my favorite dish. The Momofuku 'buns' lived up to their hype. They taste like bread, but have a marshmallow-like consistency. Also, the bacon mayo was awesome. My only regret here was that I didn't order a second bun. They are pretty small.   If I ever return to Momofuku, I would order a bit different. I ate a lot of heavy foods which made me uncomfortably full. I would most likely order more of their vegetable starters opposed to meat-based and then order two buns and split a Ramen.",

We had guests in town and this time our 11 year old son, who loves Ramen, was coming with us too.   The experience this time was great for my wife! We didn't get the Brussel sprouts and we tried the Shrimp Bao this time and my wife found a new fav. We had the chicken Katsu with Shitake gravy, that was beyond incredible! That gravy can go with anything!   My son and I had the pork Ramen, that was very delicious! Our guests had the ChickPea Ramen which was incredibly flavorful.   For desert, I had the crack pie, which is signature and always delicious, IMO.  Wife had the cornflake marshmallow cookie. Her favorite.  My son had a cereal milk with chocolate chips and hot fudge. He killed it. I managed to sneak a taste and it was very good. Its as people have said...you know the milk left over from the cereal you just ate...? Well they made it into an ice cream flavor... So good..!  I like this place a lot and do look forward to returning with guests that come into town.  I'm glad that my  wife had a better culinary experience so that means she too will return.    Whomever reads this, I hope that you have a good time there and great experience.",

When something lives up to the Hype, you are forced to acknowledge the awesomeness of that thing.   Momofuku is legit.

Bartenders seemed weeded and unorganized. Drink garnishes were nice and organized at the service bar but the two containers which had the herbs inside had a lot of fruit fly's. No apologies or care was given to that... I ordered the kanpachi which was okay... fish seemed a bit lost with the herbs and smelled a bit fishy. I then proceeded to order the pork ramen and was again disappointed. Bitter flavor to the broth and just lacked flavor and fat. I opted to pass on dessert. I'll probably give this place one more try but I was certainly disappointed",

But the portion is quite big.   2. Pork Ramen Kinda expecting something more than just that. Ive tasted something better than this. But its still better than the Kimchi Rice Bowl  3. Shiitake Bun This. Is. So. Good! Would definitely be back for some snacking time only for this!   4. Shiishite (?) Peppers I might be wrong about the name but it is listed on the appetizer side. Suprisingly this doesnt taste spicy at all! It is in a decent size and perfect for appetizer.   5. Mussels This. Is. So. Good. Too! Im not a seafood lover but Im lovingggg this! It has a perfect blend of caramelized garlic and bacon. It is sauteed together perfectly even you can lick the seasoning off of the shells. Portion is really good for the money too.   Over all I will be back just for the Buns and Mussels only!",

All of the different components cooked differently but came together in a symphony of taste and texture has me ready to go back next week for some more ( and it can feed an army! ) I cannot forget the chicken Katsu smothered in love and mushrooms. They also took the carcass of the duck, chopped it up, fried it, and brought it back to us !The final notes of the meal was the lamb and the truffle Ramen! We finished off with some crack pie and ice cream. They were nice enough to have wheelbarrows to take us to our cars. To Ryan and Neil, thank you so much for your generosity and care. We are amped to work with you and send our clients your way for sure!",

    "text": "I now understand the hype. I have been following David Chang for a while, so I was super excited when a Momofuku opened in Las Vegas. It is on the pricier side, but I promise, you are getting your money's worth.  My party and I ordered quite a few dishes to share. I got to try Spicy Cucumbers, a Pork Belly Bun, the Hamachi, Chilled Spicy Noodles, Brussel Sprouts and Cauliflower, and the Salt & Pepper Lobster and Shrimp.  The most underwhelming thing we ordered were the Spicy Cucumbers, they were good, but at the same time pretty standard compared to everything else. The Hamachi, however, was absolutely unbelievable. Even the Uni (sea urchin) that came with it was unlike any other seafood I have tried. I have lived in Japan, so I can be a snob when it comes to raw seafood, but both of those are high on my list when it comes to the best I have ever tried. The Salt & Pepper Lobster and Shrimp was an incredible dish and decently portioned, perfect for a small group to share, you really are getting that much food.  I am looking forward to the next special occasion I have so I have an excuse to come back. The service, the food, and the overall ambiance does not compare to so many other restaurants. This was truly one of the best meals of my life.",

    "text": "I was Sooo excited to eat here but it did not live up to my expectations. This has been on my must eat list every time I visit NY but I never get around to eating it when I go. So I was excited to see there was one in Vegas.   I thought the food was decently good but overpriced. It wasn't bad food but nothing to write home about. The hot tea is $25. Yes, $25 for a cup of green tea! That's insane. It doesn't even come with refils.  We ordered: Soft boiled Eggs with salmon roe- I didn't like these just because it tastes really fishy to me. No one at the table really liked these.  Pork belly bun-these were really good. The best buns out of the 3 we ordered  Chicken karaage bun-this was decent. Didn't have a lot of flavor but how can you not like a piece of fried chicken on a soft bun?  Shrimp bun-this was the least favorite bun. It didn't have much texture or flavor.  Pork belly ramen-this was good but again, nothing special. I've had much better ramen at other places.   Momofuku oysters- these were good. They had a nice smokey flavor and I really liked the crunchy topping  Chicken katsu with gravy-this was my favorite. I can't describe the flavor but it was really good   Spicy rice cakes- this was so spicy I could only have a few bites. No one at the table liked this but I liked it. I would have ate more but I couldn't handle the heat  Brussel sprouts- these are just too deep fried. They were so black and tasted burnt  Overall I'm glad I tried it but I don't see the need to go back. Nothing outstanding.",

The real star of the pork belly buns is the balance between the beautifully rendered pork belly and the Persian cucumber pickles that were well matched with the house hot sauce.   The ramen featured a perfectly cooked noodle- not too soft and just chewy enough. The broth was an amazing balance between salty and rich.   100% would return.",

They're open pretty late on the weekends, which is really helpful when you're craving a late night snack.  Ordered the soft boiled eggs for appetizers, which were so delicious!  They were filled with salmon, which made them both unique but tasty.  Also had the chicken noodle soup, which hit the spot on a cold Vegas day.  Overall, I would recommend Momofuku if you're looking for a tasty noodle spot whilst wandering the many avenues in Vegas",

If youre looking for something more interesting rather than copious and wanna get away from the excess of LV, this place is perfect. Its good, its inventive, its sane and its refreshingly thoughtful in its decor (minimal compared to the rest of vegas).  Loved it. Perfect for first meal after doing a buffet.

My Sichuan Spicy Noodle was nothing to write home about, which costs $17 when I think I can get something similar at home for $7 in the bay area. I accept this is Vegas and $10-15 would have been reasonable.  What got me was the \"hidden\" ramen that is not on the menu. Apparently it's one of the most popular items, why not list it on the menu? why didn't the hostess mention it? Why make it so secretive, why have me walk on the way from Luxor to Cosmopolitan back to Luxor only to find out there's a \"hidden\" ramen option.  I feel deceived. And for that I gave it 3 stars.",

I wanted to respond with, \"oh hello, my name is --, I'll be your customer today...\" But since I know they recently opened, I didn't want to say anything up front.  2) It took about 10 min, no joke, to get waters and ice teas. We also thought we'd make it easy and have 1 person order for the table...that still seemed to be too overwhelming for our server. I work in the industry too, and I know it can get pretty hectic, but communication is key.  3) Had to ask for a refill on ice tea 3 times before we actually got it.  4) One of the bussers reset our table with plates, a butter knife, and chopsticks after ordering ice cream and cake truffles for dessert....but WHY??   5) Had to ask for the check twice.  It was a really awkward experience for all of us. There was always a different Busser at our table trying to clear it, but was actually quite disruptive when they're there every 2 minutes. It would be a great spot to go if they would just get it together. This place is a bit pricey, so it was aggravating to pay for the bill and still tip over 20% (due to karma) for a really bad experience. Sucks cuz I really wanted to like this place.   Overall: The service was absolutely HORRIBLE! The food was not my favorite, but everyone else in my party loved it.",

    "text": "Momofuku is a nice change-up in atmosphere, service, and tasty ramen from the typical ramen joints you'll find in China Town. It is definitely more pricey, but I think I got my money's worth at lunch today.  I suggested this place to my colleague who was looking to have a power lunch before a meeting. It was her first time here, and I talked it up from my Momofuku experience in Washington DC. We were not disappointed! The 2 hostesses greeted us warmly and sat us right away. On a Thursday at 12pm, the place wasn't busy.  The lunch menu seems limited, mostly the options rest with the small plates and appetizers. We ordered the pork bun, mushroom bun, pork ramen and ginger noodles. The buns were springy and mouth watering, the noodles were cooked to perfection and not clumpy. I found the food to be very delicious and flavorful, the taste was rich without being cloying or overpowering.  I was impressed with the superb service. I saw other yelpers didn't get the same quality service which makes me sad, because everyone we witnessed at lunch today was on point. Chris and Jueen were our servers (they changed shifts in the middle of our meal) and they took great care of us. They did try to upsell cocktail drinks, but were discreet and never pushy which I appreciate. The bussers and food runners were attentive and gracious, our water glasses were never empty. What I like the best: everyone was keeping busy, staying attentive or being more engaging with the guests, even though the place wasn't busy. Nothing worse than seeing staff being lazy or ignoring people when business is slow. Thank you to everyone for the outstanding service!  Would I go out of my way to visit Momofuku? Probably not, but it is a nice option if you're already at the Cosmopolitan or want to experience a more upscale noodle experience for lunch.",

    "text": "WORST SERVICE EVER!!!!  Yes yes, we all know it just opened and there are always kinks and training that need to be worked out but SHAME ON DAVID CHANG for NOT being at the restaurant opening week and working the f*cking line and making sure everything is perfect.   Starting with the horrible hostesses that are more interested in chatting with each other than helping patiently waiting clients in line to the head chef walking around the restaurant chitchatting away, it was really a horrible experience.   I work in the industry and have been to every DC restaurant from NYC to friggin Australia and this was by far the lamest and worst of his restaurant.   There were 3 hostesses on duty and clearly they were hired for the length of their skirts vs making clients feel welcome and comfortable during the time of waiting for tables to clear. The worst part was that we waited over 30 minutes and there were a multitude of tables open in the restaurant.   The ineptness and lack of communication between the wait staff and kitchen was so embarrassing and such a train wreck that you could clearly see the breakdown. There were so many hapless employees just standing around doing nothing while every single table in my vicinity had NO food on their tables.   The \"managers\" and underlings were so basic in their attempts to appease customers that you would think this was an opening of a local deli down the street from your house.  All they did was make lame ass excuses for the delays instead of being honest and telling people that there were problems. You know what helps when those situation arise!?! You comp our drinks and food...you apologize and grovel at the customers. You don't lie and say the same damn thing over and over again.   The head chef (bearded and tattooed...and so affected) was barely in the kitchen. All the chefs I know are sweating balls during service. This guy was so casual and just chilling by the bathrooms and walking around like he didn't have anything to do.  If there is a breakdown of food and/or service, it starts with the head chef. They control the tempo and put the damn beat to the music. Without that, you have already failed.   Okay...for the food. Clearly they are catering to the customers that haven't been to another DC restaurant. It's not the best of the best by any means, but it's the stuff that they can do with their eyes closed.    Buns were good as expected. Ramen was whatever and broth was lacking density and porky saltiness. The clams lisboa and Bo Ssam were great. Pickle dish was good but any K-town place as better banchan. The spicy noodles and cold sesame noodles were stoner dormitory dishes that didn't add much.  The duck and Bo Ssam are not difficult dishes but take a lot of time and care. In NY, you have to order way in advance to get. They said the same thing for LV, but no one is ordering bc we ordered extra and they already had them in the kitchen. Btw...they made a point to tell us how long the cooking time was, but it's already a cooked dish and all the sides are prepped. We asking knowing this, why did it take 2+ hours to get to a damn table. What a joke!  Again with the service...not sure if they just expect every person to walk into the Las Vegas restaurant as hapless and ignorant, but the usual question for any multi chain restaurant is asking if you have dined with us before. It sets the pace, makes everyone feel special and also let's the server aware that yes, in fact you are familiar with the food and vibe.  That didn't happen..what happened is that everyone employee made you feel like you won a lottery ticket to gain entry and they were smug as sh*t about it.   The ONLY and most important thing in today's restaurant world are repeat customers. That's the only thing that will sustain the business. Yes, Las Vegas is 99% tourist and one off customers but word will get out that the service and food are mediocre.   It's 2017 and dozens of restaurants close down every day in every city. Don't ever get comfortable and let down the customers that are loyal, have gone to sister restaurants and intended to come back. David Chang seems not to care about that anymore and seems to have gone to the dark side of being a sell out and just another chef that just makes appearances on Top Chef.    This isn't a fancy restaurant. It's not meant to be a 3 hour service with 45 min waits between courses. They won't make any money if they don't turn tables and they won't have repeat customers if everyone gets scared to come in because they don't have enough time to eat.    I love the food but the service was so horribly disturbing that I wish I could give it ZERO stars.   Still blows my mind that he wasn't there overseeing everything and how bad the service was...Breaks my foodie heart.",

This was our 'day before the wedding' dinner and she made it extra special. It had to be because it was the last night and the last dinner before my fiance and I became husband and wife.  She sat our large party down in the private dining room with a nice table set up overlooking the strip. It was definitely beautiful and amazing to see the Vegas lights while eating dinner. I won't talk about the food because the food of course was simply amazing as it should be (just read the other reviews). This is solely for the experience.   After dinner, she kept on reassuring us that if there was anything we needed, even beyond the restaurant, even for future visits, she would gladly help us out. That is what sealed the deal for us. Extending her service and graciousness for future and repeat visits was definitely a humble gesture we appreciated. We will definitely be back!

We sat at the bar and had great service from both the waiter, and one of the chefs that spoke to us all about their menu. We had the:  Pork Buns - these were really delicious, and I could have order more and filled myself up just on those.  Oysters on the half shell - They were good, maybe not the best, but definitely fresh. Would probably go with something else next time.  Pork Ramen - Don't let them fool you, as they don't put it on the dinner menu, but you can order it any time. This was an incredible ramen, and likely the best I've ever had. My only pet peeve is that they don't put it on the menu because they try to push people to the higher priced dishes.  Definitely give it a try, it's well worth your time and $$.",

Caviar to top everything off and finishing with a five spice fried duck!!! It was the most amazing culinary experience to date.",

I've been to momofoku 3 times, I appreciate the consistency and the service. I always get the pork belly ramen, and I normally hate getting the same dish over and over, but that's how good it is! The broth alone is so rich and flavorful, and the pork is cooked to perfection. They have great bartenders and I recommend their penicillin! I love sitting at the bar and watching the chefs make the magic happen. Great service and solid food. I just wish the prices would be more reasonable. Be ready to spend when you go!",

We ordered the cold chili noodles and the shoyu ramen. Both were really good and flavorful, the ramen broth was okay, a bit salty. For dessert, we had the crack pie with the soft serve. Awesome!

The fish was fresh and delicious, however 1)The temperature it was served at was a bit on the warm side and 2)the ponzu was missing something.  I got the black cod as my Entree, served with delicious veggies. I highly recommend that dish ..the cod is not overdone and totally melts in your mouth.

So, AFTER having eaten a steak for a business dinner, I had a few drinks at the Cosmo to digest and pace myself before walking into Momofuku to eat a second dinner.  (I never do this, I'm not normally a glutton).   So from the moment of walking up to the restaurant unannounced to the moment I left, service was impeccable, friendly and attentive.  They have trained their staff well!  I proceeded to sit and the bar and ordered a pork belly bun ($14 for 2) and then a pork belly ramen ($17).  Normally that's too much pork belly for one day but I know those are two well known dishes so had to do it.  In both cases, the pork belly serving sizes were pretty big and generous which was good.  I enjoyed David Chiang's take on the pork belly bun.  It was pretty good.  I also enjoyed the ramen.  The noodle serving size again was good, broth was good, the soft boiled egg was cooked to oozy perfection and the pork belly was nicely seared.  By the time I was done, I was ready to exploded but it was worth the visit.  Again, my server was excellent and I enjoyed my time at Momofuku.  David Chiang, represent!",

It's always a difficult task for me to order when I dine alone because I want to try multiple dishes from the menu. The waiter was attentive and a huge help when I asked him multiple questions. I was also concerned in finding a small vegetable side dish that wasn't too greasy. He recommended the Spicy Cucumbers and offered that the kitchen could add less chili oil. It was the perfect addition to the delectable Bigeye Tuna that I ordered. I saw so many other tasty dishes at tables nearby while I was eating. I can't wait to make the trip back out here again.",

    "text": "This has easily been one of the best meals of my life!   This is Vegas so I won't bother talking about decor and atmosphere- of course, it's up to snuff to all other trendy restaurants on the strip.  But I just wanna dive right into the FOOD! It portrays itself as an American/Asian fusion restaurant, but they seemed pretty Asian to me... raw bar, baos, noodles, ramen... my chopsticks were ready!!   One of our servers was Cooper- he was super friendly and gave us spot on recommendations.   We started off with surf n turf baos- one Pork, one shrimp.  The Pork Belly bun had hoisin sauce, scallions, and cucumber. The bun was perfectly steamed and the flavors were balanced nicely- a little sweet, tangy, crunchy, fatty... I didn't think it needed anything else but our server handed us the signature Ssam Sauce and suggested we add that to our buns. And it was so good! The full flavor came through, even over the hoisin sauce as I delightfully detected a boozy kick to it. Turns out it's an umami-rich Korean chili paste with miso, sake, soy sauce, and rice vinegar.   The shrimp bao was like a perfect morsel from the sea. It was more like a shrimp patty with spicy mayo, pickled red onion, and iceberg.   Now... this came as a surprise to me... but the Truffle & Burrata salad was life changing! There were thick juicy slices of lightly salted heirloom tomato, fresh, crunchy greens in a lemony dressing, and big chunks of sourdough that were perfect for lathering on the creamy burrata at the bottom. I could not get enough of it!!   The Spicy Shrimp & Avocado were served over rice. The shrimp were pretty big and meaty with a nice chili garlic spice. (I transferred my avocado to my salad.)  Last, but not least, we had the Chilled Spicy Noodles- I was a little apprehensive about cold noodles at first, since cold food doesn't sound as appetizing to me... but these were so refreshingly creamy, spicy, crunchy, and delicious! They were a beautiful shade of green and spiced with pickled chilies, thai basil, and candied cashews. I think my eyes rolled back with each bite.   Dominic came by our table to make sure we were doing well and chatted with us a bit about the restaurant's roots and history... (that mysterious bullet hole!)   This was, needless to say, but I'm gonna say it anyway... an AMAZING dining experience.",

Momofuku is located inside the Cosmopolitan casino, which is filled with other trendy restaurants. I would recommend making a reservation.  The menu is filled with many items, with the most enticing being the family style selections, which serve 3-4 or 4-6. Being that we were only a party of 2, we opted for a large plate and a few small plates to share. Needless to say, the portions were still generous!  Pork Belly Buns - This is pretty much standard at trendy Asian restaurants these days, but these pork buns were really good. The pork belly was very tender and melted in my mouth.  Spicy Cucumbers - Such a simple dish with pickled cucumbers, but the spices and toasted almonds complemented it so well.   Chilled Spicy Noodles - I typically don't like cold noodles, but these were so good! The chiles brought the kick, the thai basil added that unique flavor, and the candied cashews brought everything together.  Whole Jidori Chicken - This was literally a whole chicken. The chicken was so juicy and flavorful. We asked for extra limes which made it even better. The side of kimchi was a nice touch as well.   Alright, we ordered a little too much food for 2 people and had tons of leftovers...but the delicious variety was well worth the night of overeating. Everything here is done with so much care - from the quality of food, to the outstanding service, to the ambiance.",

Just like most people who visit Vegas we were hoping for a delicious meal and an experience that made us feel like VIPs. After weeding through an overwhelming amount of restaurants and reviews on Yelp we selected Momofuku and are so glad we did!   We devoured the Salt and Pepper Lobster and Shrimp, along with the oysters, and spicy cucumbers. The food was divine (some of the best lobster I've ever had!). The timing of our food and drinks was on point, not a single beat of the experience was missed. This was all tied together by the real star of the show, our server MAGS! He was genuine, attentive, and helped us choose the perfect beverage pairings. It's not every day you leave a restaurant feeling like you joined a new family and are inviting your server to Christmas dinner (the offer still stands Mags) but that is exactly the experience we had.   We are still smiling when we recount our experience at Momofuku and will definitely be back. If you are looking for outstanding and unique food, a wonderful atmosphere, and incredible service Momofuku is the place!",

Paired with a creamy cucumber yogurt sauce, this was hands down my favorite part of my dining experience here at Momofuku. However, I can't neglect to mention the two apps that were also mouth watering delicious - the pork belly buns and their cheesy chive bread roll that came with a sriracha/coffee/mayo aioli. Everything came out perfectly cooked and you could really taste the quality of the ingredients coming through. Our waitress was super friendly and made some recommendations for our table of 9 on some of her favorite drinks and made sure that all of our food came out at approximately the same time (note that the lamb does take a little longer, but it's so worth it). I can't wait until I can come visit Momofuku again - the lamb ribs will live in my dreams until then.",

We also ordered their pork ramen.  Yummy chewy noodles and a tasty broth.  The pork was fall apart and flavored nicely.  But strangely was not served hot, it was more on the warm side?  We ordered the crispy potatoes which were also delicious, perfectly soft and fluffy inside while maintaining a crispy exterior.    Lastly, because it was my birthday, I had to order a slice of the signature Momofuku Birthday cake.  It's a huge slice so get ready to share.    Ok so the only reason why I knocked off a stars was because when reservations were made, my husband mentioned it was my birthday.  When we arrived to check in, they asked who's birthday it was and I cheerfully told them it was me. We sat down and the waiter acknowledged my birthday and I told him I was excited to choose Momofuku as my birthday choice, especially for the famous Birthday cake.    Finally after our meal, I was excited to get the slice of birthday cake.  We were a little confused why they handed us a menu for dessert but went with it and chose a slice of birthday cake.    The birthday cake came to our table with a candle!  I was so excited!  What I was NOT excited about and was shocked to discover, was the slice of birthday cake on our bill for $14!!!  We paid it and didn't question of course.  But my question is, why go through all that trouble to acknowledge a birthday yet charge for the birthday dessert?!!    Even at the most finest of restaurants to the moderate restaurants are birthday desserts usually given for free.  So beware of this assumption when dining here on your birthday.  Not going to lie that left a bad taste and disappointment as we left the restaurant.  And unfortunately that is what I will remember most about Momofuku.",

A lot of their menu items for main dishes are family style and priced fo 3-4 people so we didn't get to experience those as it was just Gary and I. We enjoyed the raw cucumber with spicy mayo, burrata, cold spicy noodles, and the lamb rack with a yogurt drizzle. Everything had so much flavor and only got better with each bite.  I'm not a lamb eater but I really was amazed by this dish. The meat just fell off the bone and the sauce gave it such a unique flavor. It melted in your mouth. The chilled noodles were definitely spicy! But the flavor was so complex and continued to get more amazing with each bite I couldn't stop eating them. Gary definitely took to the truffle and burrata. I love burrata so it was good, but it had a lot of lettuce which I didn't expect.   We definitely will be back!",

I haven't until I watched a YouTube video on it from this place!    Momofuku is a renowned chain and is known for their different takes making it into extraordinarily complimenting in a complex way!    Generous proportions so come with an empty stomach.   Shishito peppers went well as an appetizer.  Pickled cucumbers were a must in the hot heat of Vegas and refreshing!  Salad with the burrata sufficed for the veggies that was needed to support the meaty dish on the large entree ordered.  Their roasted duck was a nice savory dish.  They could have lightened up on the salt, but it was doable.  It can feed a good 5-7 people on serving size.  I looked over the next table and they ordered up the beef entree that looked like a grand feast and it looked like thanksgiving!   Great meal for sharing!",

Ehhh...  so glad we read Yelp reviews and asked if other ramens were available!  They gave us two choices, either a vegetarian or pork ramen. FYI more choices are available in their late night menu at 11pm.  We got the pork one and then also ordered the pork belly bun. The bun order comes with 2 and it was DELICIOUS. Ramen was really good, lots of pork. They have you 2 big chunks of pork belly and a heaping of what looks like pork brisket. I wish there was some veggies. I mean it was a lot of meat, almost too much for me. I ended up giving my husband more of it. Noodles were really good. Broth was okay and overall we give it 7.5/10.",

They had some spice, but not much else. We got two appetizers and a noodle dish. The picked cucumbers were not even picked they just had a vinegary sauce on top. The pepper app was a mound of peppers with too much salt and nutritional yeast on top. The noodles had some greens, sparse veggies, and a bland sauce. For the price and all the praise I expected more.  The host staff was very friendly. In fact she made sure to not sit us in front of the kitchen to avoid seeing meat cooked ... which we didn't really care about but it was a nice thoughtful gesture. The waiter was nice at first but then kind of ignored us. There is another Momofuku in NYC which may be better. I would not consider this Japanese food, but a weird American take on Asian cuisine.",

Have wanted to try one of his restaurants ever since I saw ugly delicious and i totally missed out when I went to LA and didn't go to majordomo.  We started off with the truffle and burrata (which is a salad technically, though I don't think it would win any healthy food awards). Haven't had such good cheese in a while. And the sourdough croutons were amazing!   Next were the pork buns which were amazing. Juicy pork with a sprinkling of their spicy sauce was delicious!   Also had the ginger scallion noodles which were balanced but ursting with flavors.   Service was impeccable, we also got 2 cocktails, Toki Thyme and Herb-A-Peel, both of which were excellent as well.",

Before we were seated I asked the bartender if he could make a cocktail with caffeine. He made me a cold brew martini which is one of the best I've ever had. He also very conversational and made some suggestions for dinner.   We went seated within 5 minutes of arriving.the service was great.   We ordered the Salt & Pepper Lobster & Shrimp with a hefty price tag of $238. It says it served between 3-4 people but it big enough to serve 5 people. The presentation was great but the tempura coating was extremely salty. We ended up removing the tempura coating otherwise we would not have been able to eat it.  We also got the Hozon Rice Cakes. These were my favorite. My friends thought it had a weird gummy texture but we all enjoyed it. It was something different but a good different.   Will definitely return to try something else next time.",

    "text": "\"Simplicity is the Ultimate Sophistication\" ~Leonardo da Vinci  Dear Chef Chang:  I am so confused.  Did you invent the pork belly? No. Did you invent the Bao? No. Yet you have built an empire on taking the simplest of ingredients, creating and banging out honest to goodness amazing food! What the Momofuku is next? A Fried Chicken dish with Caviar or something?  Oh wait?!... Cherished and loved is the food you've rendered for us to consume viciously but with sophistication. Thank you!   Ever Faithfully yours, Jon H.  Momofuku, pronounced MoMoFuku, is a definite must go-to place when in Vegas. Don't walk, Run! But do it in grand style with panache like our friends Joyce W. and Michael W. They were so accommodating in joining us last minute as my meeting got cancelled. Thank you both!  The night was young as the sun was still out. We knew drink-wise, driving was out of the question especially since we didn't have cars. So we all Uber'ed in to Momofuku and rolled out gracefully a few hours later.  Here's the skinny on the Pork Fat we devoured:  ~Pork Belly Bao; A Bao bun so fluffy and soft as a pillow, tucked with the best Pork Belly this side of the Milky Way Galaxy. It's truly outta this World! Comes with Cucumber, Hoisin, and Scallion and I added extra sauce which sent ripples thru my mouth! A MUST have. (Please see photo) My theory of the cute little flag with a peach placed on each Belly Bao, is Chef Chang's explanation that Momofuku means \"Lucky Peach\". Just a guess.  ~Bo Ssam; Tender? What's beyond tender? The most succulent slow roasted pork shoulder you can imagine, then take that thought to the power of 10! So beautiful, it glistened. No kidding! Also, It came with a symphony of Kimchi, Lettuce, Oysters!, Rice and 3 extraordinary sauces. It was pure poetry in motion.   ~Chilled Spicy Noodles; Insane marriage of great Sausage, candied cashews, and Thai basil topped with jalapeno peppers for a good kick in the pants! The noodles were perfectly cooked adding to the delightful texture of the dish (Please See Photo)  Man/Woman that was delicious! Next time I'm ordering one just for myself. (Only child syndrome)   We plowed it all down with wonderful alcohol and had such a beautiful dinner experience. The service was ever-present without being obtrusive. Difficult to accomplish but enjoyable and admirable when achieved.  From the moment we entered until our sad departure, Momofuku was a culinary dream. Can't wait to go back!",

We ordered two small plates (pear and burrata, brussel sprouts and cauliflower) and one family style meal - the five spice duck that comes with ginger scallion pancakes, kimchi, lettuce and a variety of sauces.   Pear and Burrata - the creaminess of the burrata with the sweet crunch of the pears - beautiful pairing and a nice way to start off the meal  Brussel Sprouts and Cauliflower - this was delicious - probably my favorite brussel sprouts dish by far - there was a tanginess that paired so well with the crisp texture of the fried brussel sprouts and cauliflower with an all-encompassing savory note in the sauce that made this addictive to eat. (We ordered two plates because we devoured the first one so quickly)   THe main star - the five spice duck - as a Korean American, the presentation and dish was new with the tableside carving of a protein that's more common in Chinese cooking, the duck, yet simultaneously reminiscent of growing up in a Korean household with the kimchi and the ceramic pot with rice inside. THe duck had the crisp exterior, rich umami taste, and tender with a slight chew. Paired with the ginger scallion pancakes and the hoisin sauce - great allusion to a peking duck preparation. But I also liked how we could almost go like a Korean ssam style with the lettuce, rice, kimchi, and duck - a more refreshing and bright take on the duck. I liked how we could pick and choose the experience we wanted -it's a really interactive dish that forces you to combine different toppings and sauces.   As with most things on the strip in Las Vegas, it's not a cheap meal, but I think it's worth going to if you're going to completely indulge in the Las Vegas nightlife.",

Two young ladies next to our table gave us their review of their entrees and told us the pork belly ramen they had was not on the menu but it was Momofuku's original signature dish and it was very good. I ordered it on their recommendation but the broth was a bit too salty for me. The heart of palm and avocado dish was disappointing with very thin slices of each with \"mayonnaise\" in the middle of the dish. Now, two days later writing this review, I don't remember what my other two entrees were. Personally, food was \"so so\" but the service was very good.

The foie gras and strawberry make for an interesting flavor combo. The wagyu short rib stew was also amazing - great flavor combo. Good wine list, too. Expensive but worth it for a special occasion!",

We had the pork buns, pork ramen, crispy fish ssam, and the crispy potatoes. The fish ssam was my favorite. You must try it at least once! It was so crispy and paired so well with the rice, kimchi, and lettuce. The ramen was also very good; I've just had better and for a lot cheaper. The pork buns were awesome and the pork was crispy and tender. The potatoes have this sauce on top -I liked it and it has a creaminess that I wasn't excepting. I wish the potatoes were a little bit more crispy. Overall, I'd recommend to try this place at least once.",

Hostess and wait staff - trying to be friendly, but incompetent.

If the price was similar then sure i would say momofuku deserves the 5 star rating. but when the price seems like 2-5 times more... then i guess i'm paying for the \"las vegas strip\" price tag.",

If you have never been: get the spicy cucumber, get a bun, get the Pork Ramen or Chilled Spicy Noodles. To me, that's Momofuku. Also get a Crack Pie A La Mode with Cereal Milk Ice Cream from Milk Bar (can order at Momofuku), and some Cookies to go to eat later.   If you like what was maybe the best cocktail I had in my entire trip to Vegas: Toki Thyme. Thank me later.  Just overall this place is perfect: sleek space, their own bathrooms that were SPOTLESS, fun servers, great buns, great noodles, and amazing drinks. Also compared to a lot of places on the Strip this is one of the best values!",

And all I knew was the name, which I thought would have at least one item on the menu with a peach in it. (Momo is peach)  I would have to say that the overall experience, and restaurant, was amazing.  I really liked the ambiance (granted, we were seated away from the main dining area, overlooking the strip). The service was great too! Everyone, accept maybe our main server, who serviced our table was very attentive and accommodating.    Everything was a bit pricey so we opted to order a few random dishes and shared with everyone so that we could get a taste of multiple dishes rather than just a few. But, each dish was delicious! The chicken, while it was mostly white meat, was very juicy, tender and flavorful!  The drink menu was amazing! The selection of alcohol, from top, top shelf to everyday \"regular\" items were available.  So I definitely liked that.    I kind of got the impression that our server didn't care so much that we wanted to order a bunch of smaller plates despite his attempts to hide it.  (Hence the -1 star) I mean, he did recommend other items on the menu which were much more expensive.   I might go back if I were going for an intimate dinner/date, but I'm not in a rush to go back either.",

We came to this place because we heard they have really good ramen, so we had to come give it a try. They only have the pork ramen ($17) and vegetarian ramen that is not on the menu.  The pork broth was light in flavor, not too heavy. The pork was so juicy and tender that it almost melts in your mouth! It also comes with an egg, bean sprouts, green onions and dried seaweed. If you want to add spicy, they charge $1 for a small thing of chili oil, which isn't worth it in my opinion. Most places give it for free and the chili oil wasn't even spicy!  OH and we also tried their pork buns, also delicious! It comes with their homemade ssam sauce, which is almost a twist between Korean red pepper paste and hoisin sauce, kind of tangy, sweet, and spicy (spicier than the chili oil for sure).   Ramen is only a small part of this restaurant and it was good, but the price was just not worth it for me.",

Looks like pesto but tastes phenomenal with all the flavors combined. It is not as spicy as it sounds. * Korean braised short ribs ($188 for 3-4 people) - the meat came right off the bone and must have been slow-cooked with a lot of love...I may or may not have been eating the leftovers after the meal.

This restaurant definitely will do.  Stopped by late, maybe around 11pm and took a seat at the bar with a friend. There was no wait. We were greeted by friendly staff who had their own comical banter behind the counter. I ordered the pork ramen and oh my goodness did it hit the spot after a few hours of drinking. The soup wasn't as thick as I am used to but that made it easier to down in my opinion. It felt \"cleaner\" and the pork was super tender.  Will definitely come back every time I go to Vegas.

It was IMPOSSIBLE to wave down a single staff when there was many of them and 3 tables. My cup of lemonade had white rings all over the top like it wasn't washed or dried properly. DISGUSTING -1 star. I tried making eye contact with the staff and gave up. I ended having to WALK to the front where the servers were standing just to get a new cup. No one said sorry or anything. WHATEVER.   Pork Baos: I've read some reviews on how people said it was \"tender\" but why on earth was mine so chewy and hard to eat? I had to put it down and wrapped it home for my dog to eat because it was sooooo CHEWY. I really wanted to like it. :(  Pork Ramen: GOOD. For that price tag I expected a little more.

I had memories of momofuku in NYC being okay but nothing spectacular but really wanted to take my mom to show her one of David Chang's restaurants and his style.  It was a nice space, decked out with David Choe art on the walls, and the service was great. We felt very mixed about the food..  The spicy cucumbers and the pork belly/shrimp buns started off our meal on a high note. Then we had the rotisserie chicken ssam and shared a ramen. The chicken and kimchi were too salty. And the shoyu ramen was not as good as we had hoped.   The meal wasn't awful but it wasn't outstanding. I definitely see where the ssam dish and ssam sauce were going conceptually.. I kind of wish it was more traditional Korean ssam sauce or that the chicken were less salty and had a deeper flavor. Good overall meal but could have been better. Maybe our expectations were too high?",

This place is supposed to feel like good approachable food with the same sort of vibe for the staff but instead it falls very short.",

The smaller plates came first: the shrimp bun was warm and fluffy, the chilled spicy noodle was as delicious spin off of a traditional SzeChuan style cold noodle  (as a native SzeChuanese, I approve!!), and the grilledlamb ribs were so tender the meat just fell off the bone (the bone literally fell out of the meat, ricocheted off my hand when I attempted to catch it, and landed on my friend's plate!!). . And then they wheeled out the star of the show: the 5 Spice RotisserieDuck. They wheel it out on a cart because the chef combines all the 5 spices into the dish right at your table. Then he skillfully carved the duck into delicious slices and laid them on top the rice. The juices from the duck meat slowly seeped out and began covering the rice. Omg.  Instructions: take a lettuce/scallion pancake as your base, spread on some sauce (there's 3 to choose from, or you can combine them like I do ), layer on some rice, then add in the duck meat, and enjoy. So moist, much flavor, wooooooow. Must doge because words are hard when the food is this good...

    "text": "Finally went to Momofuku to see what all the hype was about. For someone who's watched every video on David Chang known to man (and Christina Tosi too) it was time for me to see what this place was all about.   Overall, I'd say I had a good meal. As someone who spends a lot of time in Asia, many of the flavors were familiar to me. The fusion of American and Asian was fun on the whole. If you've never been, never plan on going or rarely go to Asia then this place is a treat.   The bao (ordered the pork and the shrimp) were good. The pork bao is a classic dish, but is amped up with smoky pork and richer sauces. The shrimp bao is a really good fusion of Chinese and Thai as the shrimp in the middle is very similar to a Thai shrimp cake while the wrap is still large.   The lamb ribs were a surprise - sweet, salty, spicy, tangy Korean style ribs paired with yogurt and dill from the Mediterranean. I never expected that these would go so well.   The spicy cold noodles we had were like a cold pesto with meatballs. It's discombobulating in its flavor combinations but if you like cold noodles this should be fun for you. The pesto is made with Thai basil so that in itself will be a nice surprise.   We kept this meal simple as we planned to head to Milkbar for dessert.   If I had any one of those dishes alone (except the bao), I would say that the it would be overwhelmingly eat dishes with so many complicated flavors. However, if you are a group of 2 (or better yet, 4 or more) order to share. You will enjoy your meal much more that way.",

Instead of waiting for a table, the bar is first come first serve with the full menu! We decided to eat at the bar and service was great!  We ordered the pork bun (HIGHLY RECOMMEND), shishito peppers (over rated but maybe bc I'm not a huge peppers fan?), pork belly ramen (HIGHLY RECOMMEND), and a shrimp bun (not the best..). Overall, I would recommend anything with pork.. it is very well made and delicious! The ramen was a decent size for us to share along with the small plates. I'm not sure why everyone raves so much about the peppers.. they weren't spicy but also didn't have much flavor. The shrimp bun was disappointing and I probably wouldn't order it again.   All in all, it is worth trying and the pork bun is a must!",

There was also a spicy cold noodle dish which I forgot what it was called but it tortured my innards while being so great tasting at the same time.  For those who are not familiar with the Chinese mala oils, it isn't that spicy at first but with each bite it becomes increasingly numbingly hotter until I had to cry mercy halfway through.  The entree chose was the grilled lamb ribs which just melted off the bone.  It was a lot of food but everything was familiar but with a memorable kick to it which made it for some impressively ingeniously prepared plates.  The first and third items mentioned are quite pricey but sharable.  The middle dish is also sharable but hard to find someone who is just as much of a glutton for punishment as I am.  So many more choices that I wanted to try like the black bean lobster and the whole striped bass or the wagyu tri tip, but at least I have something to come back to next time I'm in Vegas or NY.  People keep talking about the bo ssam but I feel like I'd hit the staples before I go for the pork.",

Every dish is what you would expect if you've been to any of the Momofuku locations--delicious, well presented, and artfully compiled.   The pork belly ramen was good; the pork belly itself incredibly tender, the additional components I'd requested were fresh, and the poached egg proved itself a nice twist to the typical boiled egg. I did wish the broth was a bit more delectable as it didn't give me the deep flavor I was looking for in the dish.   My only other complaint was the iced tea--watery. Tasted like a 'quick brew' had been done, the ice cubes watering down what flavor may have been there after the brew. I requested to exchange for a ginger ale instead--safe bet.   Aside from that, it was an overall nice experience to kick off what turned out to be a great date night on The Strip.",

Kim chi came out last even though it was appetizer, and it just blah, no kimchi flavor nor spicy as if they didn't give it enough time to be fermented. The pork belly bun was prob the best of all the dishes we ordered but I've had better. I ordered the spicy pork ramen noodle then later our server came out to tell us that they ran out so I had to order the chicken ramen noodle. So the chicken noodle came out, tasted ok, too salty and no special flavor. Then after I almost finished eating my chicken ramen, the spicy pork noodle came out. They did the same thing to the table next to us. The penicillin drinks were just ok, again, nothing special. Don't waste your money/calories.",

I didn't think I'd ever get the chance to try it myself however this weekend I found myself in Vgas and stumbled on the Momofuku in the Cosmopolitan by chance.  I swear I was giddy with excitement waiting for my pork buns and pork ramen and I wasn't disappointed. The pork buns were absolutely delicious with just the right amount of perfectly cooked pork belly.  Only downside was I thought the buns themselves could have been warmer but that didn't stop me wolfing them both down with gusto. Then came the ramen. I can't even describe it other that to say it was better than I had dreamed. The broth was delicious and there was just the right amount of everything in there. I need to go back to my Momofuku cook book and re-read how to do the egg because this was absolutely perfect. All in all a fantastic lunch and great value for Vegas. I highly recommend this to everyone and I will definitely be back next time I am in town.",

We made it point to have lunch at Momofuku located in the Cosmopolitan Hotel.  We ordered, then the food arrived for all except me. I mentioned it to the waiter who said it would be coming.  Time passed and everyone was nearly done eating.  The waiter came by again, offered me another beer (at an extra charge) and said my food was coming. I waited longer and no food.  Next time the waiter came by I told him I was going to McDonalds and I left.  My wife said a manager came by after I left and asked how our lunch was.  My wife complained about my food never arriving.  The manager only said \"sorry, the kitchen is very backed up \".  No offer of a discount or a free drink, nothing. Be ready to pay $18 for a mediocre bowl of ramen, $17 small glass of Chardonnay, $9 for a 12-oz bottle of Singapore beer.  Will never go to this restaurant again, who cares if it's on the Strip. What a huge disappointment this was. Would not recommend - too many other great choices.",

Both our stomachs hurt and we didn't eat more than four bites before we had to stop and leave. 2 drinks and 2 ramen in the trash cost us $78. Should have spent it gambling again.

I dont understand why they didnt mention i needed to reserve a seat when i called for the address and location. Very frustrating.

    "text": "We were a bit disappointed by the majority of the dishes here, with most of the dishes being relatively bland and uninteresting. Of the dishes we tried, we liked the smothered katsu chicken the most, however you've had better katsu chicken (panko crusted fried chicken) elsewhere. The thing that made this dish interesting was the shiitake mushroom gravy, making it almost like a chicken fried steak. The gravy tasted like there might have been a bit of Japanese worchestershire sauce in it, which added an interesting tartness to the dish that was appreciated. I'm a sucker for gravy and for chicken fried steak, so I was happy with this dish.  Unfortunately, everything else was wholly underwhelming and monotonic. The shrimp buns were essentially shrimp cakes stuffed inside of a Chinese bun (the type served with Pekin duck). The shrimp cake was fine. It tasted like shrimp and that was essentially it. The description noted that there was a spicy mayo and pickled red onions. While these sounded like a great addition, the mayo was essentially like plain mayo and the pickled red onions were missing in flavor. The dish could have benefited from the tartness and sweetness of pickled red onions but alas these flavors were missing. The Chinese bun was also a bit lack luster. There was none of the sweetness and fluffiness that is normally in these buns.  We also tried the pork ramen which again was disappointing. Being from the Los Angeles area, we are spoiled by a plethora of great ramen, with great ramen being a perfect pairing of noodle, broth and ingredients. If you are expecting a tonkatsu based broth with flavor built from hours of simmering pork bones, you will be sorely disappointed. Here, the broth is completely lackluster, tending toward a weak soy sauce and bonito flake-based broth. It is too monotonic in flavor without added complexity, tending too much toward the use of bonito flakes making the broth fishier than it needs to be. The noodles were the standard Japanese noodles. The pork shoulder also had an odd bonito flake flavor to it and was too dry. The pork belly was fine but definitely not the best you've had.  Our waiter really sold the spicy cucumber calling it the \"best pickle you'll ever had\". So obviously with this much of a sell, the result was going to be disappointment. If you think of this dish as a cucumber with a sprinkling of some chile flakes, then you will be less disappointed. If you were expecting a tasty Japanese tsunomono pickle with an enticing combination of sweet and tart, then you will be disappointed. We were disappointed, as we wanted more complexity in flavor.  For dessert, we tried several items that were essentially from the Momofuku Milkbar next door to the restaurant. The cereal milk soft serve was a bit disappointing as we've had the cereal milk shake at McConnell's Ice Cream. There, the cereal milk shake reminded you of the real reason why you ate Tony's Frosted Flakes as a kid, for the cereal milk residue after the frosted flakes had given of themselves completely for the greater good, before wilting into soft flabby corn flakes. Here, the cereal milk soft serve tasted more like they used regular old generic \"great value\" corn flakes without any of the frosted glory that accompanies premium Tony's Frosted Flakes. The results were, alas, disappointing. We also tried the crack pie which was made with butter and brown sugar. It was overly sweet and tough to eat more than a couple of bites, until my wife came up with the genius idea of combining the underwhelming cereal milk soft serve with the cavity inducing crack pie. The sweetness helped the lackluster cereal milk soft serve and the soft serve tempered the overly sweet pie. Finally, we tried the corn flake and marshmallow cookie. It is hard to describe this, but it was not pleasant. We usually finish everything but this was not edible, so we ended up not even finishing a third of this cookie.  I think if you are okay with subtle monotonic flavors, then you will find this place reasonable. For us, it was underwhelming with the exception of the smothered katsu chicken, but again you'd had better katsu chicken elsewhere.",

Both delicious I thought the shrimp was better my husband thought the pork was - to me the pork belly one tasted just like you'd expect it to. The shrimp was formed into a patty and had pickled onions and a yummy sauce. For our meals my husband got the Chirashi Bowl - which if that's on any menu he's going to order it. One of his favorite things but sadly we live in AZ so it's not common. I got the Chilled Spicy Noodles. After I ordered it I was second guessing myself. Not something I would usually get but OMG it was amazing. Almost like a Thai basil pesto on the noodles and it was spicy but not overly. My husband's was delicious too - I don't mind things like that but again just not something I usually get. I prefer hot food but I was surprised how much I enjoyed a bite of his. We observed a couple different people ordering different types of Ssams and we were a little jealous. The table next to us got the chicken and our server said the duck is delicious - I believe him after that meal! We don't typically go to the same place more than once on vacation but we're staying @ The Cosmopolitan so we have to go back for dinner and broaden our palates. I was super impressed by just lunch so I'm excited to go back!",

Not the puffed kind that most North American are familiar with... More like rustic pasta. But it needed much more sauce to infuse with the rice cakes that would have make this much more to my taste. The pork ramen soup had a piece of braised pork belly and some shredded pork and a slice of fish cake, poached egg and a piece of Nori. Flavors were good but for the price I was hoping for something more memorable...",

The ramen tasted so salty I found my lips marinating in salt stings after three bites. Told them to add more broth or lessen the salt. Ramen came back with literally the same saltiness. I looked around and found tables of people leaving with their food untouched.  Now it begs the question, if a chef/restaurant prides itself soo much on pairing, ingredients, and pushing the boundry, then why the f can't they do a simple bowl of ramen comfort food correctly?  Tried some other dishes. Same kinda pretentious low quality food that I can whip up myself from simple asian markets.   The decor, the price and being inside the cosmo hotel are the only high end mark ups this place has to offer. Damn shame on messing up simple asian food. Stay away.",

I tried to get a reservation on open table but it said there were no availabilities but when I called there were lots of open spaces. So if you are looking to make a reservation definitely call and don't use open table. We got the hamachi, Sichuan lamb ribs, crispy potatoes and rotisserie Jidori chicken. First off, I don't even like raw fish but I enjoyed the hamachi. If a non-raw fish girl like me can eat it anyone can. The lamb ribs and potatoes were to die for. I would come back just to eat those two items again. Momofuku has ruined lamb for me anywhere else. It was so tender, and fell off the bone, covered in an amazing sauce. The potatoes were the best potatoes I've ever had. Absolute perfection. The chicken was good but nowhere close to the other items I ate. The service was great too. They let my boyfriend sample the sake before drinking it and were super attentive the entire time. Definitely a place to try while your in Vegas.",

    "text": "Being that it recently opened, this restaurant has already generated quite a bit of buzz. It comes at no surprise as this is acclaimed chef David Chang's first west coast implant of his popular Momofuku restaurants located in NYC, DC, Toronto and Sydney. When we arrived early for our reservations, they gave us no fuss. We were seated moments later and our server Omar was friendly and knowledgeable in regards to the menu. He also assisted us with drink orders promptly.  The manager even stopped by to say hello, which was a nice touch.  We were presented with some smoked salt & lime shishito peppers and the citrus cured fluke crudo with pickled plum and nori, which were both amazing.  The crudo really shined with bright acidity from the lime and it exhibited a soft, supple mouthfeel. A pleasant start to our culinary adventure ahead. Next up were the highly anticipated noodle dishes, which included the house favorite, pork ramen and chilled spicy noodles with pork. Omg, the noodles for both dishes were cooked perfectly with an irresistibly chewy mouthfeel and had the \"eyes rolling behind my head\" sort of feeling.  Btw, that's a good thing, a really good thing!  Coupled with an irresistibly flavorful broth and beautifully fatty pork belly, the ramen dish was a winner in every sense of the word and is deserving of its current fame. The chilled noodles with Sichuan sausage, Thai basil and candied cashews were no also ran imo. All the components worked wonderfully in this dish. From the crunchy textures of the cashews to the deep permeating flavors coursing through each and every strand of bright emerald green noodle, it had me pining for seconds. Be warned, however it is indeed spicy, but nothing you can't handle, right? ;) For dessert we enjoyed the famous crack pie with some cake truffles on the side. Both desserts were sheer bliss but undoubtedly cranked my blood glucose levels way up!  That being said, we high tailed it over to neighboring Milk Bar for even more sweets. Hey, I'm in Vegas, this city is the definition of decadence, right? So when in Rome...but that's another review altogether.  Overall, i had a fantastic dining experience here and If our lunch experience was any indication of the restaurant's entire menu, I have no doubt in my mind I will return soon. From quick and friendly service to clever twists on Asian style comfort classics, this is a stop you don't want to miss when strolling through sin city.   Happy Eats!",

We arrived during Social Hour at 5:10pm and opted to be seated immediately on the bar facing the kitchen.  I wondered allowed (in total dismay) at where the mussels were on the menu, and someone in the kitchen shared that they are of course served at dinner (starting at 5:30pm) and not during Social Hour.    We were in a time crunch (and not because we were trying to keep within the complimentary parking that ends after 1 hour -after that, up to 4 hours is $7 at the Cosmopolitan- so stay, enjoy your meal of course, but if you have somewhere else to be as we did, save that $7 for an extra bun!)  as we had somewhere else to be, so I was concerned we might end up mussel-less which is pretty \"weak\" sounding... ;-)  Alas, the same gentleman in the kitchen replied when I asked if we could be any chance order them early, \"well, sure.  Tell them I said its ok.\"  WHEW!  Thanks dude!  The mussels were amazing....  REPEAT: ORDER THE MUSSELS.  STAT.  **Dry Roasted Mussels - benton's bacon, momofuku furikake  This is just genius.  BACON + MUSSELS (or MUSSELS + BACON - whatever) it's just a pairing that should have preceded PB&J and Bacon+Eggs.  (Or Bacon + anything.  It should have been Mussels first).  Smoky.  Amazing.  We also had the spicy chilled noodles- GET THESE TOO!  We'd like them a bit spicier next time, but that's a small quibble for the genius of sichuan sausage with cashew and jalapenos + thai basil. (PS- it says \"candied\" but ours didn't seem candied and we prefer it un-candied, so it was amazing the way it was.  **Chilled Spicy Noodles - sichuan sausage, thai basil, candied cashew  And of course we had a pork belly bun.  Could have had 10.  2 nice little slices of pork belly in a little bun with hoisin sauce.  A little cucumber and scallion completing the taste perfectly.  Executed with such ease.  I really could have eaten about 3 of these and called it a day (except there are too many cool things on the menu)  **Pork Belly bun- hoisin, scallion, cucumber  Well done, David Chang, and gang.    Shaun King, I'd like to shake your hand (except your hands have better things to do).    And all you folks in the kitchen who are chopping and assembling food and making this happen- thanks.  You are seen and noticed and awesome.  Thank you for coming to work every day.  Your work is incredibly tasty (and how many of us can get that sort of compliment about our work? ;)  Can't wait to visit on my next Vegas trip!",

This is an Asian inspired restaurant located in the Cosmopolitan hotel. Me and my date were fresh off the plane waiting for our room to become available and were starving. The name of the restaurant was catchy and so we decided to see what it was all about. Unfortunately I do not have pics of all of our drinks nor the pork belly buns but they were fantastic; believe me when I tell you! We shared the chilled spicy noodle dish, by the time we hit the bottom of the bowl we were looking for more. It has a nice pesto type sauce with perfectly balanced sausage and cashews.

    "text": "Although I've been a huge fan of Momofuku Milkbar for several years, I've never actually eaten at inside Momofuku in New York. Now that I live on the west coast again, I jumped at the opportunity to be able to try David Chang's food in Vegas.  The food here is on the expensive side for what you're getting. $34 for chicken katsu is OBSCENE. I've literally never heard of any restaurant charging that much for panko breaded fried chicken. So I have to subtract 1 star purely for that.   My husband and I ordered the Pork ramen (pork belly & shoulder, slow poached egg) and the Chilled Spicy Noodles (Sichuan sausage, Thai basil, candied cashew).  The ramen arrived first and it tasted great!! It doesn't really taste like any ramen I've eaten in Japan or at any ramen joint in LA, but the noodles were awesome as was the broth and the pork belly had super crispy fatty skin that melted in my mouth (does that even make any sense?!). The difference between this broth and other ramens I've eaten is that this one had a very \"American\" taste to it. I'm not sure how else to describe it!  The star of the meal was the Chilled Spicy Noodles. Holy shnikeys, this was SO FREAKING GOOD!! I love bold flavors that punch you in the mouth and this perfect bowl of noodles fit the bill. Spicy, slightly sweet from the candied cashews, umami rich, and a hit of tanginess from the pickled jalapenos. Oh man, I was so tempted to order a bowl of this to-go. This was my husband's order and I had food envy throughout our entire meal as I had chosen the pork ramen. Once I took a bite of the chilled noodles I didn't want my pork ramen anymore, that's how good it was. The sauce that coated the noodles was like a Thai basil pesto. Aaaaah I want more!! I only wish I had gotten a photo of it before digging in but it was one of those #uglydelicious bowls so I was like nahhh. But now I regret not having a proper photo of one of the best cold noodles I've had in recent years. I do, however, have a photo of a half eaten bowl so please enjoy.   If you're staying in or anywhere near the Cosmopolitan DEFINITELY try the Chilled Spicy Noodles at Momofuku. I promise it'll give you a full blown foodgasm.",

Of course, you have to order their famous buns! Our favorite were the pork belly buns, and I would advise you to order more than 1 because it will leave you wanting more. The shrimp bun is also delicious as well, shitake also good, but the truth is nothing compares to the pork belly bun. In addition, the shishito peppers are also excellent, a recommendation from our bartender and he did not let us down.",

This isn't a \"Ramen Shop\" so don't expect fancy ramens (they don't have spicy miso!) But they did have options of either Pork or Chickpeas. I went with the Pork Ramen of course (your girl needs her meat!!). The pork was cooked beautifully, it was rich in flavor and melted in my mouth. The one thing that threw me off was the poached egg, I like my ramen egg seasoned, not poached, but hey an egg is an egg I still enjoyed my bowl",

My first experience with Momofuku was when I lived in NYC and experienced their pork buns + ramen; was delicious 8+ years ago at the East Coast location. Wanted to see if the experience can be replicated in Vegas... :)  We made reservations for Monday for lunch at 1230 pm, but honestly - no reservations were needed. Plenty of seating inside the restaurant, which is located on the 2nd floor of the Cosmopolitan Hotel. We ordered:  1) Pork belly ramen - pork belly & shoulder, slow poached egg; my husband ordered this and thought it was pretty good but he's had better ramen at Tsujita in Los Angeles.  2) Pork buns x2 - hoisin, scallion, cucumber; this was as good as I remember it, although the pork belly was pretty fat. We each had one! It's pricey at $7 each though. 3) Chilled spicy noodle - Sichuan sausage, Thai basil, candied cashew; I've never tried this before but decided to get it because I wanted to experience something new. They use some type of green spicy pesto sauce to toss the cold noodles, it was quite spicy and the sausage they gave me was very generous.  I think our meal was 3.5 stars overall. Service was rather slow, but very friendly!",

    "text": "I am absolutely thrilled that Momofuku is now on the West Coast. David Chang's famous restaurant opened up this year at The Cosmopolitan and so now we have the yummy Momofuku eats closer to home.  After trying out Momofuku CCDC in DC just last month, I checked out Momofuku Vegas and equally had an excellent time. This was not surprising since I loved CCDC so much.  Right from the moment, I stepped in service was phenomenal. I have to give props to General Manager Ryan and his crew for the excellent service. Our server Gregory gave a good description of the different plates of the menu and made recommendations based off his favorites.   Our meal started here with sudden small plates. We tried the shishito peppers, spicy cucumbers and crudite plate. If you like spicy, the spicy cucumbers is good for you. The shishito peppers aren't all spicy but there maybe one or two in there that will shock your tastebuds ;). Lastly, the crudite plate is good for sharing.  Another plate that was good for sharing was their katsu chicken. It's a good crispy chicken plate and the bulldog sauce accompanying it is excellent.    My other favorite shared plate was their Spring Vegetable Rice Cakes! I've always been a fan of rice cakes and they make an excellent rice cakes dish here!   We also split their chickpea ramen and their pork ramen. The pork ramen was my preference though I did think the chickpea one was something interesting and unique.  My absolute favorite however at Momofuku are their buns. We tried one of each of the buns they offered; their pork belly, shrimp, shiitake and chicken karaage. Each was delicious but the chicken karaage was my favorite! The karaage is so crispy and tender.  I absolutely loved my visit to Momofuku Vegas. Every thing was excellent from the service to the food!",

    "text": "No idea why the reviews are so highly regarded here. I came here today because my friends and I who were in town for the weekend wanted some ramen. Since this place had good reviews, we decided to go.  They only really had 2 types of ramen, the pork one and the chicken one. We got the pork one just so we can compare to all the other pork ramen we've had at countless other restaurants.  Food & Taste: 1/5 - DON'T come here if you're looking for good ramen, or even decent ramen. My rating is solely on my experience with the ramen so it's possible that their other food was good. But the ramen was $18, probably over 2x what I would expect to pay for even GOOD ramen. The presentation was okay, but the flavor was awful. The broth tasted nothing like ramen broth, it was more like one part water, one part soy sauce, and about a cup of salt. Extremely salty! I couldn't enjoy the ramen at all. The pork cuts were good, but the salty and flavorless broth ruined it.  Service & Experience: 3/5 - They had decent service, our waiters were constantly refilling our waters before we finished which was good. Nothing special though, our waiters weren't too friendly or welcoming.  The ambience was nice, very cosmopolitan-y. But felt weird using wooden chopsticks at a nice restaurant where there were white, cloth napkins to use.  Value: 1/5 - Again, I paid $18 for a bowl of ramen that was worse than a $1 instant ramen I could have made at home. Even if we paid $8-10 for ramen, which is regular restaurant price for good ramen, this was barely worth the price paid. Very low value.  Overall, don't come here for the ramen. Probably the worst I've ever had",

Both delicious but likes shrimp best. It was a shrimp cake of chopped shrimp - well flavored especially with some Ssam chili garlic sauce.   For the mains, had the pork ramen and the crispy chickpea ramen.  Both were A-MAZE-ING!  The crispy chickpea ramen had the chickpeas plus this delectable garlic-soy bok Chou that could only be described as life changing.   Also had a couple cocktails. Both of which were very good. This place is definitely worth considering.",

I was really hoping for some amazing noodles but with the constantly changing menu, when we went there wasn't a single hot noodle/soup dish - super disappointing. I did get the Ginger Scallion Noodles but alas they were served cold. Our friends ordered the family style Whole Roasted Branzino on kimchi which I think was my favorite dish along side the Waygu Potatoes. Overall, I think the menu wasn't on my side this time so it was a pretty pricey meal for nothing special.",

    "text": "We had heard of David Chang and wanted to try his restaurant while on a vacation in Las Vegas. After a full day of hiking, our appetites looked forward for a unique meal. We arrived at 9:30pm on a Thursday evening and waited 5 minutes for a table. The interior had a nice vibe to it, a tad noisy but nicely lit and comfortable.   After reviewing the menu, we decided on one entree to share and 4 bowls of noodles. The Whole Roasted Branzino looked good along 4 bowls of Pork Belly Ramen. The waiter noted that the Ramen was not available until later that night but he asked the kitchen and they were able to accommodated us. (The Momofuku Ramen was one of the the main reason we wanted to try this restaurant)   The Branzino (large whole fish wrapped in kim chee then placed over rice) was very flavorful, but kim chee tends to overwhelm any type of food, especially when it's used over the entire item. Unfortunately the Ramen (specifically the broth) was a surprise. I like a Ramen that has a savory broth, one that hits the taste buds and makes them light up. We all looked at each other and then wondered if this was really the Momofuku Ramen. The broth was like hot water.....hardly any flavor. Was it usually that way, a very very light broth? Or perhaps it was still not quite ready (they offer noodles in their late menu). Or did the Branzino with strong Kim Chee overwhelm the broth?   Granted, our expectations were high, after all it is a well known restaurant. Did we arrived to early for the broth to simmer properly? Did the cook forget to add something? In my opinion, the Ramen was not what a Asian food establishment should serve. Every restaurant has an off day (I used to work in one). Maybe it happened on this particular day....too bad.",

Thank you Vegas for bringing so many big names from all over the country to one conveniently sinful location. It's nice to be able to knockout several foodie temptations in one weekend.   We made our way to Momofuku after a day pool party. We didn't have much of a wait to get seated. I ordered the Chicken Karaage steamed bun and the seven spice slushie. Hubby ordered the chicken sandwich and our friend ordered the chicken and pork belly buns.   The chicken bao was perfect. The serving size is just right in the sense it satisfies you and leaves you wanting a little more. The bun is light but sturdy enough to hold its fillings. The meat is crispy on the outside but oh so juicy within. The ssam sauce brought a nice spicy kick to the entire bao. Hubby enjoyed his chicken sandwich, but funny enough wishes he would've gotten the bao instead (especially once we walked next door to Milk bar).   The seven spice slushie was refreshing and had a good heat to it. I wished it came it yard size instead of a small glass.   I'm definitely stopping here when I am in Vegas and it works as an inexpensive snack meal or full entree meal.",

We called \" security\" who filed a lost and found report as I watched my credit cards rack up $6000 at the apple store and $3700 at Kay Jewelers in the 30 min it took me to go to my room and cancel my cards. Want to know what the restaurant did about it (after we also paid a $1000.00 dinner bill ). Absolutely nothing. Won't even look at camera footage. They handed me a managers card, who shrugged and said I'm sorry.   Eat here if you want the opportunity to dine in a high end restaurant where you can have your shit professionally swiped.  My coworkers saw no one other than staff walk by.",

I don't know if it was what I had ordered, but not a place I would splurge on. It's mix of asian fusions of korean and chinese.   Shrimp bun- it's a bao bun with shrimp cake with spicy mayo. It was decent. But for $8 a piece it wasn't amazing for the price.  Ssam sauce- they say it's their hot sauce, but it really isn't hot sauce. Its basically korean gochujang (red pepper paste). Usually used in things like bibimbap.   Chilled spicy noodles- this is what I had ordered. It was chilled noodles with crumbled sichuan sausages, crushed cashew nuts and basil and peppers. The noodles was mixed in some sort of green sauce (maybe a basil type sauce?) I dont know, but it was rather bland. Combine all the ingredients of the sausage and peppers in a bite and then you have some flavor. The sausages in the dish was a bit salty for me. I added the ssam sauce to my noodles to give it more flavor   Rotisserie chicken- So a friend ordered this dish..close to the bone the chicken was under cooked and a bit raw. Server told the friend that many people eat jidori chicken as sashimi because it's one of the cleanest chickens. Mmm...yea regardless of being the cleanest chicken, i like to eat my chickens fully cooked thank you very much...  Overall, i was not impressed. Service was slow for a place like this. Food was mediocre and overpriced. Music was blarring, so hard to hold a conversation without yelling.   I would probably give this place another chance, but not anytime soon. Maybe a year or two from now. Pretty disappointed...",

The music was crazy loud, so much so our server could barely hear us and we weren't able to talk much with each other but the food made up for that 100%.  Maybe my husband and I just aren't cool enough for such a hip scene.  We'd rather talk and enjoy some quiet than hear subwoofers.  However the food was everything we hoped it would be and more!  We started with a steamed pork belly bun.  It was sweet and salty pillowed between the softest bun and tender pork.  The shishito peppers were also fantastic, though they needed some salt which was nowhere to be found.  The curried jerk chicken was out of this world.  Oh my goodness I will dream about it.  The accompanying fresh herbs were so delicious mixed with it.  This was so divine we set our tableware aside and dug in with our fingers.  It was so satisfying.  The chilled noodles were out of this world.  I was concerned about the sausage (not always a big fan) and in the end it was one of my favorite elements.  My only complaint was we needed more noodles!  We could have each eaten our own bowl.  It was so fantastic.  This meal was incredible and on my list of top favorite meals I've had.  It was a dream come True.  Rock on Chef David Chang, I'm such a fan!",

    "text": "Returned for a Sunday dinner res at 830pm with husband for Cisco Live. They were packed until about 9ish. I literally tried a third of the menu, and it was all STUPID good. Started off with a juicy jem of a cocktail featuring whiskey, pineapple juice, and a black cherry. Forgot the name but would totally reorder!   Worth the splurge: BIGEYE TUNA - summery poke for the gods. On first bite, decadent creamy flakes of foie gras melt on the tongue, into crisp refreshing watermelon cubes and taste the delicate tender tuna.   BENTON's Country HAM. Hubs is a bit of a jamon snob after Barcelona but he approved of these savory rich slices. Red eye mayo is a dead ringer for Haagen Dazs coffee ice cream. Slap em both on soft sourdough and we have a winner.  KARAAGE BUN. David Chang fries chicken reeeeeally well among other things. The pork belly and shiitake buns lean sweet. This and the shrimp bun are savory. This will be my default bun from now on cause I lurve salty vs. sweet.  MARKET GREENS. Order this to appease one's conscience and to feel healthy. Perfectly balanced complexity of flavors with some crunchy rice sprinkled on top. What's not to love?  Pass:  Rotisserie chicken & fried bones. Sweet chilli glaze and coconut slaw did not do much for me. This same flavor profile can be found at a local Thai resto for much less.   TTFN Momofuku! Until we meet again~~  Previous review: A delicious taste of NYC in LV! I was lucky to nab last min res Fri 7:30pm for 10ppl. The space has a casual/urban feel due to a giant mural by graffiti artist, David Choe.   LARGE FORMAT BOSSAM- tender, juicy, fall-off-the-bone. Bossam is Korean pork dish traditionally wrapped w lettuce and topped w raw oyster, pickled kimchi, and salted shrimp. David Chang's rendition kicks it up a notch, slow roasting pork shoulder for 5hrs and changing the sauces to pickled garlic, hoisin, and hot sauce (mild by Korean standards)! The raw oysters were fresh, creamy and a hearty medium size. We asked for extra bibb lettuce, kimchi, and sauces. The presentation could improve by splitting into 2-3 settings for us since we were seated at a long rectangular table, not a lazy susan circle. It's tough passing around a heavy giant bowl of pork from one end to the other while stuffing one's face!  Not memorable but still devoured without a bite left: Smoked pork chop Asparagus Chicken katsu looks basic now NO mushroom gravy :*(   Unexpected:  Chickpea ramen is creamy Pork ramen broth is clear. enjoyed both but price is steep for ramen. enough to share Creamy chilled spicy noodles were yummier than the ginger scallion noodles.   Notes to self for future visits:  Wear buffet pants/muumuu. A half order of large format entrees suffices if ordering additional menu items. Skip the eggplant and oysters momofuku. Toppings mask the oyster flavor I personally enjoy, and also were missing kimchi, spinach, or bacon notes.",

Overall, they bring you the chicken and caviar and teach you how to eat it. To be honest, you can eat it however you want and ignore the instructions. I just decided to put caviar onto my chicken and bite into it because I was often lazy and more hungry.  Service was pretty good and the food was fine. Quite pricey but it's David Chang's restaurant and probably worth it for the ambiance.  Try it out for yourself because it's quite the culinary experience...or it could be bs to you - just an expensive version of salmon roe and KFC.

The fish, baked in kimchi, with bonji ponzu, is new on the menu and makes for a most impressive \"WOW\" moment when it arrives They have carefully separated the meat from the bones the two-pound fish will not be a huge wresting match for you and your date. It was so big we made do with that and two appetizers for whole dinner. The cucumber in spices was refreshing and crisp and a good balance for the fish.

We got the Pork Belly Buns to start. 4 out of 5. The pork belly was fatty and well cooked. The cucumbers had that great sweet taste I like. The only part lacking was the bun. It was a little dry.   My girlfriend got the Bo Ssam Bowl. 5 out of 5! The kimchi fried rice had great flavor and served well as a vessel for the other ingredients. My GF, very smartly, added an egg on top and this is required if you get this dish. The pork was sweet and daikon was crunchy.   I had the Grilled Striped Bass with Kimchi butter. 3.5 of 5. I was hoping the kimchi butter would add more flavor. The fish skin was salty in a good way. But a bit over powering if you took a big bite. The fish was fresh and had good taste. The veggies and mushrooms on the side were very good.   Yuzu Lemonade. Very good but a little steep at $9.  Service was great! And the interior of the restaurant is beautiful. I recommend that you get a reservation. It seems like you are sat in a nicer section.",

    "text": "I've been wanting to try a Momofuku forever. Last time I went to NY, I couldnt score any reservations at any of David Chang's restaurants. I was  pretty excited to come here despite everyone telling me it wasnt that good and wasnt comparable to his NY locations. So I mentally prepared myself that I'll be overpaying for underwhelming food, not exactly the ideal scenario, but with that in mind, I actually enjoyed my dinner. I mean, this wasnt any different than other high chef restaurants in Vegas. You know what you're getting into....you're paying to be on the strip (I'm sure the rent they pay to Cosmo is insane) and it's not like David Chang himself is there to ensure Quality Control.   Cucumber appetizer - must get. It has a little small kick for heat, some nice crushed Marcona Almonds, and some old green sauce which made a great appetizer.   Baos - The Shrimp patty Bao was better than the pork belly. Pork Belly was standard, you can get anywhere else.   Pork Ramen - This is a lunch item but we requested it during dinner and the server let us order it. The broth was simple and easy flavored. If you're looking for a dense Tonkatsu ramen broth then this isnt for you. I think this was more of a Chinese flavor profile.  Half Jidori Chicken Curry Rub - The chicken was tendor but it didnt have enough curry rub. Skip this dish.  Spicy Rice Cakes - Momofuku's take on the Korean Dukbokki. a nice fun twist. There some minced pork pieces, fried scallions tossed in a mildly spicy sauce. Def easier for the western palate while retaining some good asian flavors. just dont compare it to real dukbokki.  Stop by Milk Bar outside for some softserve afterwards.",

Then we ordered pork ramen and ginger scallion noodle. It took long time for the dish to come for some reason, so we were hungry.  Pork ramen was lukewarm.  Ginger scallion was bit too spicy for my taste.   We are used to Japanese Ramen and lukewarm is not something we expect from a bowl of ramen.",

Their version of bossam = bbq pulled pork.  For that price, give me the damn pork belly I came for.. not some pulled pork.  Hell.. give me some Hawaiian rolls so I can make some sandwiches.

Shishito peppers: flash fried and topped with an earthy salt seasoning.  Ask for a side of lemon and give it a squeeze on top. Muah, perfect.  Spicy cucumbers: tossed in a spicy seasoning with smashed avocado.  Super crunchy, especially with Spanish almonds that top it  Heart of palm salad: tomato, snap peas, avocado,watercress, and a dressing blessed from above.  If we didn't already order so much food, I would have asked for another.   Whole Jidori chicken: seasoned with lime and curry. Wow, what a combination and the chicken is moist and juicy. Comes with kimchi and a side of rice. Ask for soy sauce and shiracha on the side, boom, fantastico.  They have dessert from the milkshake bar next door.  We were stuffed, so didn't venture there.  Don't be fooled by the casual bar area that you see when you walk up.  There is an entire area behind that is a bit nicer.",

The pork was nice and tender and went will with the bun.  We also ordered the spicy cucumbers for appetizers and was pretty tasty.  Now on to the entree's we ordered...  He ordered the salmon and he wasn't to fond of it especially for it being super pricey. I ordered the Shio Ramen with the Pork and I could barely even eat it.  The only thing I ate was the pork which was such a waste.  The broth was so salty that I don't understand how people like it.  I was really hoping that because this place is in Vegas at the Cosmo that the food would blow our minds but it was just meh.    The service here was impeccable as the wait staff were always checking on us and refilling our waters but I probably wouldn't come back for the food at all since it was super pricey for mediocre food.",

Unfortunately, due to the front of the house service, it really left a bad taste in our mouths and will not be back.   The food, in general, was fair, not amazing. We had dinner at Hakkasan last night and the food and service was outstanding! Momofuku's food and service does not even compare. Hakkasan is on a whole other level!  Back to Momofuku.....Our waiter was doing his best even though he had 3 large tables to cover and was bussing the tables himself.  Our waiter had a great attitude and did an amazing job given the staffing situation.  They have to figure out how to better staff their lunch staffing so that there is no lag in the service.  Nevertheless, we had a nice time celebrating with our family. However, on our way out, we simply asked the 3 hostess in the front to take a quick family picture in the front of the restaurant and all 3 gave us attitude. One reluctantly said she would but proceeded to tell us how busy they were at 2:30pm in the afternoon (after the lunch rush). There was no one standing in front of the restaurant waiting to be seated! There was no smile, just attitude.  This is what we will remember about our mom's birthday lunch where we just dropped over $500!  This is a new restaurant in a city where there are many amazing restaurants with great service. Due to our experience with the front of the house, we will take our business elsewhere. You gotta figure out better training for the face of your restaurant.",

The summer truffle ramen was something totally different from your standard Japanese ones. Well worth the money to try again and again. The salty/sweet taste of the ramen is unique that I can't even describe it. The pork belly bao was the best I ever had. Soft pork belly goodness with a crispy exterior. What more can you ask for? Service was top notice. Since they had a power outage, they provided complimentary cold dishes like salad and beets. The salad has a dressing like Mama instant noodles.

    "text": "My sister suggested my husband and I go here for date night so we tried it out. We've never had Ramen before so we were looking forward to it. She told me I had to try the pork bun. I was going to order it but out of all the choices for the Ramen the pork belly with egg was my choice so I ended up not getting it because that's just too much pork fat in my belly. My husband is more of a steak and chicken guy but there weren't really options for that. He ended up picking one that was really spicy. It ended up being too spicy and he couldn't even finish half of the bowl  but I chowed mine downnnnnnnn!  It was delicious! I loved it, and I'm getting hungry for it just writing about it! I feel so bad my husband didn't enjoy it as much as I did. Because the Ramen was a little heavy I also ordered one of their slushy type alcoholic drinks. I couldn't make up my mind so our waitress gave me a couple samples and I found the one. It was minty and refreshing! Yummy! Also, everyone there was smiling and happy...wether they were serving you or not! Great service and great food! can't wait to go back!",

We were the first table there in the morning so we got extra attention and really enjoyed it. Three stars mostly for service.",

    "text": "I had way higher expectations for this place. Everything is pretty much overpriced so you're most likely not getting what you pay for. We ordered several of the buns which were good but not that best we've had. If the pork ramen was a little less salty, I think it would've made a delicious dish.   The most annoying part of our visit was the service. Everybody in our party ordered at the same time and we all got our food at the same time, except the chicken katsu which my boyfriend and I ordered in the very beginning. We waited another 5-10 minutes AFTER everybody else was done eating, and our katsu still didn't come. The entire table was getting frustrated because we had other plans. My friend decided she wanted another bun so she ordered another and it still came before our katsu! 5 minutes later, we decided to flag down our waitress (who barely came over) and told her we wanted to cancel the katsu. She told us that they were already cooking it and that she would check on it. Next thing you know, she's walking over with our dish and she just hovers it over us as if she wanted US to move the dishes on the table. I'm all for helping but she had a free hand and didn't even think to move the plates until I started doing it for her. We all felt that the katsu would have been better with a little less gravy so that the breading on the chicken wouldn't have been so soggy. It was also $34 which I think is ridiculous for chicken katsu.   Overall, we were all pretty disappointed with our experience here and most likely won't go back. There are plenty of other places in Vegas to eat that's worth your money.",

However, the food was not what I expected. The pickled veggies were...meh. The pickled radish was refreshing, the spicy bean sprouts were good, the peaches...no comment, the kimchi was so weak. The pork belly bun was good (ordered two). The pork ramen was good; however, the broth was very near the border of saltiness. The half chicken was ok. In Atlanta...heirloom BBQ has amazing fried chicken and pickled veggies. The salad which came with the chicken was heavily dressed in salty ranch dressing. The Chinese broccoli was way too salty; we really could not eat it. Overall...too much salty flash...not much substance. We did go to Milk Bar to get 6 cookies and crack pie. Very good!",

The bun wasn't super spongy/stretchy so it started ripping down the middle and the hoisin sauce got all over my hands. I though the pork belly was perfectly cooked and cucumbers were a nice and refreshing addition. I was a little bummed about chilled spicy noodles since they removed the sausage from the dish a couple weeks ago. My server Chris was awesome and asked if I would like to substitute it with the pork belly. The noodles were still great. I get why everyone says the sauce is very pesto-like. My favorite part was the candied cashews! Overall, my experience here was good. Most of the dishes seemed overly priced though ($7 for one pork belly bun). And I was charged for water even though I was never offered tap. I was wondering why I was getting \"special treatment\" because I had a bottle of water in from of me while everyone else was getting their glasses filled from a pitcher.",

The apple salad was pretty much apple slices with some kimchi sauce. Usually Korean places serve up super yummy apple salad with their homemade sweet dressing. The ramen wasn't up to par either. The noodle texture was good, but the pulled pork and the pork belly in the ramen was only tender yet not flavorful.  Overall the bowl of ramen is average at best compared to what we have had.",

When paying $98 dollars for a steak that comes with fries  as a side I was expecting to be blown away. I was not, very disappointed.

The pork ramen broth was very flavorful, not too salty or oily, just the right amount of that Momofuku flavor.  The appetizers were tasty as well: the soft boiled egg, the pork meatballs, and the Benton ham.  My favorite was the soft boiled eggs which had salmon roe and though there were only four, I could've had like 2 more, it was that good:)  The bartendar, Josh, was nice enough to whip up an original concoction deriving from his Oxnard strawberry roots called \"The Field of Dreams\" which had bourbon, strawberry, and a hint of basil that highlighted the drink to make it a sweet yet light summer drink.  Excellent service (especially to our servers Carlos and Shar), clean restaurant, fun ambience, and cool music to excite the taste buds!  So go to Momofuku and get ready for the mind of chef, David Chang, to blow your mind with Asian flavor persuasion;)",

I found them to be not spicy, but my husband claims one of them was actually spicy and caused him to tear up (he might be on the low end of spice tolerability scale though...).   I would say the vegetarian options are very yummy. I actually enjoyed the shiitake bun more than the pork bun. We shared the chickpea ramen with poached egg-- very flavorful! I was not a fan of the crunchy chickpeas but only because it slowed me down in slurping everything else. As a meat-eater, I was surprised at how delicious this ramen was.

Steak bowl had good fired rice, but was very greasy.  Shrimp bun shrimp had a terrible dry texture. Tasted like a Big Mac w shrimp  It's basically just hip. Same as Manhattan",

I ordered the ramen and the presentation was nice.  The pork was cooked just right and had great flavor. Unfortunately the soup was not hot, just warm.  Wasn't sure if it was supposed to be like that. There was a gently poached egg that was laid on top of the soup.  Instead of slowly mixing it further in the soup to get that creamy texture, it didn't do much of anything.  I recommend you go elsewhere to get warmed up with a nice bowl of soup.",

    "text": "If I had to only say one word about this place to entice your stomach to go on a culinary adventure that will blow your tastebuds away... KATSU!!!!!!! This doesn't describe this place as a whole in one word but it really tells the story of why I will always return to this place. The one reason, the one taste, the one and only thing on my mind when someone says katsu. I've never tasted such a universal staple dish of cuisine such as katsu that tasted nothing like its original form (or at least what I think katsu should taste like).   As I took my first bite of crispy chicken smothered with the rich creamy mushroom filled sauce I thought someone had given me a Japanese flared version of jaeger schnitzel. This was such an unexpected flavor but I love German food so much and Japanese curry changed my life. Someone perfectly molded these two flavors together and added their own personality as well. You must taste for yourself!!! Go right now!!! Don't wait for the world to end and for you to have missed an epic one of a kind dish. Restaurants in my eyes have those one or two dishes that make me go back. I've told you about one of these so far; now it's on to the next dish that blew my mind.   Brussels... Brussel sprouts to me are a lot like cauliflower; they take any flavor you throw on them. If correctly executed they can explode like an atom bomb of layered flavors. The flavors had more layers then a f$&@ing foot tall lasagna. This was a chefs special I'm not even sure if this was on the menu but they set it down and I couldn't get enough. They didn't even look like Brussels to be honest. This could've been how they cooked them or the seasonings, perhaps a bit of both. Bottom line this is the second dish that will keep me coming back for more you must have these!!!   On to the rest of what we had, I've already told you what you have to eat here but I'll touch base on the other dishes as well.   Pork belly buns best I've ever had. I'm gonna go ahead and list off the other places I've had pork belly buns at on a regular basis  -district one -bachi burger -about seven other places but were not good enough for me to write on this list  Ya um the even tenderness of the slice of pork on these buns this is why it's better and on another level then the places listed above; this makes you able to only take one bite without having the whole rest of the pork slide out of the bun. The flavor was so epic totally what a pork bun should have.  They also had a special fried softshell crab bun. Softshell crab is something people underuse in restaurants today. It's just as tasty as fried chicken but without the hassle of picking the meat off a bone. Thumbs up to momofuku for putting the softshell on the menu and in a bun it deserves.  So I'm not going to touch base on the other items we had here mainly because the pictures will speak for themselves and I've told you what you have to order already. In case you forgot KATSU & BRUSSELS...  Nuff said OH I forgot to mention the ramen silly me.  Honorable mention  -pork ramen was very on point super clean execution on the flavor of the broth, texture of the noodles and the two kinds of pork (pork belly pulled pork wtf? I know delicious idea). No ramen is complete without a perfectly cooked egg. In this case a slow poached egg that you pierce with your chop sticks and swirl around the richness of that yolk to enhance that already spectacular whirlwind of flavors. Mmm...  If you have read this far seriously let me finish by saying don't wait okay. Just do your stomach a flavor!!!",

For small plates, we ordered the shishito peppers and the spicy cucumbers. Shishito peppers were my favorite part of the meal...so much umami and zesty flavor. My husband loved the cucumbers which had such a fun play on textures. We both ordered the ginger scallion noodles with poached eggs and chili oil as our entrees which were perfectly portioned and there was a new experience every time we moved down a centimeter in our bowls.

The only thing was the duck was still very rare and the meat was really chewy. When I informed the waitress that the duck was still uncooked, they were not very sympathetic or apologetic. We felt the restaurant could of at least offered to make our drinks on the house for the inconvenience of waiting an extended period of time to start our dinner. Very classless! Especially when we had to pay $300+. Never going back there again.",

Atmosphere was great, and our waiter was great but the food fell short for me. I was hoping to get blown away however, it was just an, \"eh\" for me.   What we ordered: 1) pork buns - obviously very good. Good size portion for $7 each.  2) Dry aged ribeye- ehh. For $98 dollars for a 10 ounce I was hoping to be amazing and it just wasn't that memorable. The meat was extremely chewy, sooo chewy that my bf at one point had to spit it out. Fries were extremely salty, which didn't pair very well with the dry rub. The sauce that came with it, did absolutely nothing.  3) Fried Lobster & Tempura- (half portion at$136) I was the most excited for this, but was super disappointed. The lobster and shrimp were over battered, and way to salty. Along with being overly fried, they add a bunch of sauce that makes the tempura soggy. The flavors were all there, after one of each, my palette just didn't care for it.   All in all, I would recommend trying it however, I think there are better places to eat on the strip. We spent $300+ for a mediocre dinner. Sad day",

The ramen was perfectly al dente and alkaline. Broth was piping hot as it should be. Truffle ramen, chick pea miso ramen, and the classic pork belly tori paitan style ramen- all perfect and so unique in their own ways.  There are also very good appetizers like the spicy cucumber and baos. I highly recommend the cucumbers. There's an excellent balance of acidity, sweet fresh cucumber, roasted almond, and a little bit of heat. The baos are just always awesome, too.   The prices here are a bit steep for what you think you're ordering,  but that's just Vegas+David Chang. Outs width it to splurge now and then!  Don't forget to try the deserts. You can either go to milk bar next door, or order from the table!",

My friends and I just decided to stop by because it was a new restaurant and we were all so pleased with the food! We didn't order the expensive $200+ Korean inspired dishes because we have tried them at many Korean restaurants but I am sure David Chang offers an amazing twist into these traditional Asian dishes.  If you need a carb loading day, this place really hits the spot!  We all got the famous pork belly ramen and the port belly buns. You must try their pork belly if you visit.  The ramen was about $18 and the buns were $7 each and they're a decent sized portion.  I loved the tender perfectly cooked pork belly that was a bit crispy on the outer edges. The ramen broth was more shoyu [like soy sauce base] but it was soooo perfect with the noodles and the meat. This is probably my favorite ramen place! I highly recommend the ramen here.",

I particularly enjoyed the summer truffle ramen, the bao (we tried all 3 - pork belly, shitiake and shrimp and they were good in that order), and the momofuku oysters.  Good were the spicy sichuan rice cakes, and crispy potatoes.  Ok for me was the Almond Hozon Eggplant.  It doesn't get 5 stars because as good as it was, the price value ratio was still a little off for me.  I first heard of Momofuku because of their ramen, so I find it strange to see that they've recently removed all the ramen options from the menu.  They still make it if you ask for it, but I guess they are trying to push the price point of dining up?  Anyway, worth a try for sure.",

    "text": "Always heard wonderful things about Momofuku and always wanted to try it so on my most recent business trip to Las Vegas, I had booked reservations to eat at Momofuku.  It's located at the beautiful Cosmopolitan hotel on the 2nd floor next to Holsteins. I'd recommend reservations to prevent any waiting. There is casual bar seating and also a nice dining area. The view is pretty nice on the strip at night so great for a date. All the dishes you order are sharing dishes so you'll probably need about 3-5 dishes to fill up two adults eating there. Their service is top notch since their staff constantly comes to check on your table, make sure your water is refilled and cleans up after every dish finished.   Note that you can order the ramen if you're sitting at the dining table area and not the bar - we didn't know but apparently you could order it off menu.  We ordered the following:  Rotisserie Jidori Chicken - very crispy and juicy but a little on the saltier side for us...needed to drink about 2-3 glasses of water to wash down all the salt (or maybe I was dehydrated due to how dry the weather is in Las Vegas....or maybe both)  Ginger scallion noodles - just like what the description says  Pork belly bun - really flavorful and fall apart pork belly...only comes with one order of the bun  Shitake bun - decent...only comes with one order of the bun  Chinese broccoli - really good flavors and the sauce was on point with the dish  Korean rice cake - a little disappointed in the spiciness level...we wanted it to be spicier but our waitress told us that too many patrons were saying they couldn't handle the spiciness (I'm thinking those patrons are weak sauce)  Damage to the bill...wasn't by far anything I had imagined...I think it was about $100 and change which is really reasonable for dining in Las Vegas.  Would I come back...hell yes! I like Chef David Chang and also what he has to offer at Momofuku.",

Our waiter, Caesar, was very nice and attentive. Being used to typical genuine Asian foods of 626 areas, I didn't think I would like it. We tried Pork belly bun $7 a piece:meat really tasty, very fatty. \"Bun\" bread is not as chewy and tasty as, say, NBC restaurant. Deep fried brocolini was very delicious! We're impressed with the sauce. Chilli noodles are good, it's dried dish. \"Ssams\" dishes with salmon ( not on menu, but today's special) is interesting to eat. It's eaten with butter lettuce: put rice, meat, kimchi inside lettuce to eat, and best is chili sauce.   Downside: they charged for water!!!, but this is the United States of America... Water should be free everywhere .",

She was so kind to stop by our table, even though the restaurant was slammed, just to wish us a happy new year.  LOVE her!!  The salt and pepper lobster/shrimp was fried with way too much salt, pepper, and sweet teriyaki drizzle--1/2 an order is enough for 5 people. 2 or 3 bites is enough to feel full--it would be a great appetizer but for me it was way too heavy for a meal & way over-flavored. But good to have just a little of.   Overall this place is great due to the staff. Make sure to try the buns!",

    "text": "Having seen David Chang on multiple cooking shows, I had high hopes for my first Momofuku experience. My verdict is that this place is super overrated and pretty disappointing.  Their buns are good, especially the pork belly + chicken karaage ones. However, their 'signature pork ramen' was really bad. We ordered 4 bowls of this ramen and every single one of the bowls had clumpy noodles. I ate one bite that had at least 10 strands of noodles stuck together in one massive doughy clump. That's honestly unacceptable for a $20 bowl of ramen. We told the server nicely so that the chefs could watch out for this in the future but she seemed pretty unapologetic.   As for the milk bar desserts, the cereal milk soft serve that everyone raves about was just okay. Personally, I'm not a fan of salty flavours in my desserts (e.g. salted caramel, maple bacon etc) so I didn't love the saltiness that came through from the cereal. However, my friend got the crack pie and that was HEAVENLY. I was kicking myself for getting the soft serve...I would give an arm and a foot to have another bite of that crack pie ugh.",

The beau and I shared the following: kona kampachi, shittake mushroom bao, shrimp bao, and chilled spicy noodles, and every single dish was absolutely delectable. The kampachi was refreshing, both baos full of strong and distinct flavors pillowed between the softest fluffiest cloud white bao bun, and incredible spicy noodles with candied cashews.   We also had the Milk Bar's birthday cake, crack pie and cereal milk soft serve with cornflakes. They're both pretty good, but not anything truly extraordinary.   Momofuku is the first restaurant I can say with certainty that I will return to; I have yet to say that  about any other restaurant I've been to in Vegas so far.",

We tried the cucumber and ramen again: both were done perfectly this time. In addition we tried: Oysters: fresh and delicious Tuna with shaved foie gras: refreshingly light dish Kimchi hanger steak: kimchi was fresh and tasty. My wife really liked it. Steak was prepared right and served on top of rice. It wasn't just plain rice. I liked the flavor hidden in the rice biting into it.  Our first encounter was near midnight when we just arrived to Las Vegas. That might explain why everything was so salty. Next time i would talk to my server immediately. Overall, this is a good place from caring management to chefs that pay attention to details",

For $268 for this dish, save your money for other things. It was OVERLY salty let's just say that, definitely not worth it and I would never recommend this item to anyone (it was actually a recommendation from someone). Sorry but this is my honest review of this dish.   Was going to come back for the lunch menu today (Friday 12/14) but I think I will pass on that.",

    "text": "Japanese - Korean - American fusion with an attitude.  This is bold, bad a$$ food that will leave you stinking of garlic and reeking of kim chi, an uname finish swirling up your nasal cavity and F'n wiith your brain.    Flavors are extremely bold with Korean influences unrestrained.   The Momofuku oysters, think Rockefellers with kimchi, spinach and bacon, impressive.  The sour, fermented notes of the kimchi boost the briny flavor of the oysters.  A dusting of breadcrumbs adds great texture.  The spice, purifies the sweetness.  The bigeye tuna dressed with bonji (similar to miso but made of fermented grains), and covered in shavings of freeze dried foie.  The result, beautiful. Earthy, mineraly, in all the right ways, that pleasantly boosts the \"fishy\" flavor of the tuna.  Tip:  for parties of three or more, skip to the \"Large Format Dining\", solid items served family style.  The Bo Ssam, outstanding.  Dry rubbed pork, roasted for hours before being topped by a raw sugar caramel glaze.  Fall apart tender.  Grab a leaf of lettuce, pull off some pork, add rice, kim chee, a dollop of the spicy ssam sauce and toss on a raw, juicy, kushi oyster, the harmony of flavors is impressive.  Sweet, sour, spicy, porky with the perfect umami finish.  The five spice rotisserie duck is equally impressive.  The carcass, legs and thighs removed, is dry rubbed with Chinese five spice powder.  The flavors, epically the star anise permeate the breast to the bone. The finished duck is sliced and served on a bed of crisp rice mixed with shredded, confit legs and thigh meat.  Residual duck fat flavors the rice while the extremely aromatic breast scent the air.  Some ssam sauce and OMG!    It's not to say everything is perfect.  The pork ramen, isn't that special.  The noodles are more Chinese than Japanese, lacking high gluten and flavor only achieved by using multiple kinds of flour.  The broth is frankly, boring.  Also the pork belly bao is passe.  Done by so many.  It lacks the wow factor to justify the $7 price per.  Good selection of craft cocktails, decent selection of Asian beverages, beer, and wine.  High Vegas resort markup.  High energy, efficient service.  Bold is beautiful and Momofuku slams it in your face.",

After taking our order, he said ,\"siopao and pansit coming up!\"  I thought what he did was ghetto and I'll-mannered.  Last but not least, I love spicy foods, but the Schezuan noodle had a weird after taste. The cold soba was okay.  The server did not even check on us.  Although he did not charge us for the Schezuan noodle, I would not recommend Momofuku to any of you food lovers.  I had to tell them that it tasted weird.  I hardly ate 1/4 of the dish.

    "text": "We happened to be in the Cosmo and was excited to try out this Momofuku location. We ordered the pork buns, shoyu ramen, and the bo ssam rice bowl. Overall the pork buns were the best followed by the bo ssam rice bowl then the ramen. To be honest the ramen was pretty disappointing and tasted extremely bland. Having tried ramen in Japan and elsewhere in the world, this is one of the biggest let downs from our meal. There was just not enough flavor in the ramen and the noodles tasted closer to the ones in cup noodles.  The rice bowl tasted pretty good but it's not something that's worth coming back for. The service throughout the meal was good but other than the pork buns the other items were not as memorable.",

We tried:  - Pork belly Bao:  simple but super tender and flavorful.  5/5 - chicken karaage Bao:  nice breading, but not as memorable as the pork belly 4/5 - pork ramen:  good thing we read the Yelp reviews to expect a lighter broth than what we prefer for ramen.  The egg helped give some richness to the broth and set off the strong shio flavor.  There's nothing wrong with this ramen but I wouldn't order it again 3.5/5  Service was professional, and we would be open to visiting again for dinner.  I've been to three of the NY Momofuku restaurants and hope they add more to the lunch options here.",

I expected warm and moist buns as I usually get when I order buns at other places. Both the pork belly and the mushrooms had too much sauce which is  overpowering. I can only taste the hoisin sauce and can't barely taste of the pork and the mushrooms.  I will give 5 stars for the service.  The waitress are nice and attentive. When she asked about my food, I mentioned the overpowering taste of the sauce. She offered to make me another one with less sauce and the manager came to apologize and didn't change for my food. I'll give it another try by ordering other food beside the buns.",

I had the pork ramen, soft-boiled eggs with arugula and ikura roe, shrimp cocktail, and the pork belly bun.  The pork ramen was certainly disappointing. The alkaline noodles were a touch soft, and the broth lacked depth of flavor. Only the pulled pork shoulder and pork belly imparted a modicum of flavor into this dish.  The soft-boiled eggs were even more disappointing. They came lukewarm, and the ikura roe completely overpowered the dish with its saltiness.   The shrimp cocktail was uneventful, with 6 tiger prawns and a fusion-inspired cocktail sauce that was sweet rather than spicy.  The pork belly bun was the only item I enjoyed eating. The bun was fluffly and the pork belly had a melt-in-your-mouth texture and was not overly seasoned.  Such mediocre dishes tarnish David Chang's name and bring into question his ability to expand the Momofuku chain while preserving his culinary vision. If this establishment is a portent of further efforts, he should re-evaluate his plans.",

Meal: 1 Pork Bun 1 Shiitake Bun           - Chilled Spicy Noodles           - Lamb Ribs           - I think I'm missing something else...  Definitely get the buns and try out some of it before you use their ssam sauce! The flavor is amazing and I don't know if it's the price or the actual flavor, but it tastes more expensive and tasty (very springy bun and tender meat(pork)) Be sure to use their ssam sauce as it adds a whole other side!  The chilled spicy noodles was all right, but growing up in a taiwanese household, I've had better.  Lamb ribs just fall off the bone and are incredibly delicious, especially as someone who has lamb pretty often it was a treat (:  Cheers Momofuku, I'll see you again soon.",

The ramen also costs $18, which is absolutely ridiculous for some noodles and soup. The pork belly buns were amazing - full of flavor. The oysters were also a plus but considering the price, I won't order them again. Our waitress was friendly and explained everything.

It's a great spot for solo diners.  I came to Momofuku because I craved ramen. But after seeing their pork belly bao sandwich on the menu , I had to order both the ramen and the pork belly sandwich. Wow. That sandwich is so good, crispy, tasty, and delightful. Ramen is as good as other ramen I've had (there's one ramen shop in my hometown that does it extremely well, and I go there on a regular basis. I'm pleased to taste a similar dish of equal quality).   To finish the meal off, I had a tiny cup with salted / caramel chocolate ice cream with caramel cereal flakes. Highly recommended.   Delicious, overall, and the service was wonderful.",

The lunch menu becomes buns and ramen only after 2:30pm, so plan accordingly. Also, the menu changes, so the pics you see on yelp may not be available to order. Overall, I would give this place 3.5*, service was great but the food is not worth the price you pay.  SOFTSHELL CRAB BUN 4* $24- This was a special the day we went. It was $24 for 2 buns which I thought was bit steep (what'd I expect really though) but it was really tasty! There was a whole softshell crab in each bun, batter was fluffy but crispy. The star of the bun was the avocado sauce and pickled peppers. The combo of the creamy avo with the freshly pickled peppers was perfect!  CHICKEN KATSU 3* $34- They recently did a \"revamp\" of this dish and it's no longer the shiitake mushroom gravy. Instead, the chicken katsu comes with a side of pickled shiitake mushrooms and a mediocre sauce with Japanese mayo. This is more of a \"traditional\" Japanese preparation of the chicken katsu. The chicken itself was prepared to perfection, meat was super juicy, outside was very flaky and crispy, but I wasn't impressed by the dish overall. I would have preferred the old katsu because it was more unique and had their own \"take\" on a katsu. For $34, I wouldn't order this again.  PORK RAMEN 3.5* $18- Solid bowl of ramen. Broth was flavorful but not creamy or oily which was nice. There's 2 types of pork - pulled shoulder and belly. Both were good, but of course that belly was bomb. That egg though ;)",

This was my first time at one of David's restaurants but I'm a big fan of his, and had high hopes.  This was just a quick lunch before my flight, so I ordered a shrimp bun and a Bo Ssam Bowl. The ensuing experience was like a religious epiphany for me, a meal that I'll remember for the rest of my life. In both dishes, the combination flavor, aroma and texture was so perfect, utterly sublime. Every bite brought something subtly different in the interplay between flavor and texture. Just an incredibly delicious, incredibly memorable experience.",

    "text": "So was in vegas to search for lady luck at the gambling games before reigning in the new year. Unfortunately I was not as lucky as I had hoped but fortunately I had the opportunity to go on a \"cheat week\" for my diet and ended up eating at a bunch of spots which brings us to momofuku located in the cosmo. I had been hankering lately for momofuku in NYC so this seemed like a good spot to make the first dinner night while in Sin City. I made a reservation and got seated right on time. The server was extremely friendly and took the time to explain the full menu and provided her own favorites with detail which certainly helped. The joint itself is a classy affair with nice tables and nice decor adorning the walls on the second floor of the cosmo.   The menu consists of a raw bar, small plates, buns, country ham, noodles, sides, meat & seafood, and the large format dining things. My party was not large enough to order the large format dining items but the table next to us had enough people for the fried chicken  and caviar and our mouths were watering the entire time we saw them eating. Make sure to order these in advance and call the restaurant as it is not prepared on the fly and takes some advance notice it seems. It seems like 3 - 4 dishes is probably good for two people depending on what you order of course but my table went with the Big eye tuna with foie shavings, black truffle ramen, the Sichuan lamb ribs, and a side order of Brussel sprouts which ended up being more than enough for two. They also have a solid Japanese whiskey menu so of course I went with my whiskey ways and ordered a few of these bad boys. The big eye tuna was first and it was delicious. The tuna was quite fresh and oh man.. those foie shavings were on point. It took me a lot of restraint to not lick the foie right off the plate. The truffle ramen (priced at $50) was really solid. It is not your standard ramen to expect from a place like ippudo but a True fusion blend. The truffle was faint but it was well balanced into the ramen itself. It was definitely a unique experience and definitely worth a try at least once if you are searching for a fusion ramen. The noodles were slightly overcooked vs what I normally like but still solid. The Brussel sprouts were good but it was a bit too salty after a few bites.  The Uni sauce on top made it tasty for the first few bites but the salt started overpowering half way through the side dish making it hard to eat in large helpings. The star and surprise of the night was certainly the Sichuan lamb ribs. I was hopeful for this dish but did not know what to expect. The ribs came out with great presentation adorned with jalapenos. The meat was cooked perfectly and absolutely tender and the chili yogurt was the perfect complement to the heat that was brought by the spices. The cucumbers on the bottom also provided a nice texture balance to the overall tenderness of the meat. It really was delicious and is perfect for those searching for some heat.  All in all, a solid experience at momofuku. It is not truly Asian but offers that nice Asian fusion blend that I am sure people could be searching for especially after all those  buffets and heavy American food options around. Definitely will be back when in Sin City. Also make sure to get your Identify points with the hotel rewards program!",

Unfortunately it didn't deliver: the ramen were just average, I wouldn't call them bad but I've had much much better ramen in some other places  (don't even get me started about the ramen in Japan).  Also the appetizers were nothing special, actually, I had to consult my pics on my phone to remember what they were... meh!  Also, the service was also on the slower side, I like to drink a lot with my ramen as most ramen broth is quite salty and the waiter never bothered to top up my glass. We had to waive him down every time we wanted something and often we had to wait long-ish to get him down to our table. Knowing that we were there off-peak and the restaurant want only half full makes me fear the worst for when it gets more busy.  Sorry David but I expected more from you... so, with the variation of food options in Vegas I will think twice before I go again.",

Very modern, it fits the look of the Cosmopolitan. We were seated at the bar area and all the servers were very friendly and accommodating.  We ordered one bao to share, and a ramen. We initially ordered something else but had to cancel mid-dinner as someone had a problem holding in the food. The servers at this point could see her struggle and was offering sprite and other things to calm the stomach which I thought was very helpful.  YES get the bao. It is delicious and you will not regret it.  The Ssam sauce goes with everything.  The ramen, while delicious and full of meat, I think I would not order it again because I would like to try the more sophisticated dishes on their menu.  Maybe some day we can order the fried chicken with caviar (starts at $300+) but you may need 4-6 people for that. Maybe if we were with a group we could try that.",

We shared the crispy potatoes (amazing), as well getting the pork belly pinch buns (drool) and the very best ramen I've ever had.  I'll skip to the ramen and tell you why you should at least get one for the table to try. Beautifully soft-boiled egg on top sitting on a healthy portion of noodles, and both pork belly AND some shredded pork. I've had my fair share of ramen, and just have never had one with both pork belly AND shredded the pork. Both were cooked perfectly and just made the whole dish taste delicious.  The restaurant itself was also beautiful. We sat in the back part that big windows to look out and get nice light in, and a really interesting mural that was the length of a long wall.  Don't forget to stop by Milk Bar next door. Birthday cake truffles to go? Yes please.",

I arrived with the full understanding Momofuku has executed a twist on classic asian dishes. The twist however, just wasn't something that wow'ed me.   Growing up in China, I had already been accustomed to tastes of what a bao should be so trying an over-complicated version of something the nice lil old lady used to sell for 50 cents around the corner of my block on Shanghai felt wrong. I wanted the moment where I'm transported back to my childhood and instead I got and overpriced pork belly bao with sauce.   Surprised also that they couldn't make me an affogato especially when they have Milkbar connected.   Definitely hyped.",

Our main course was the kimchi stew with wagyu short rib stew. The stew was rich and tasty.  We realized we could had order rice after we ate the stew. The richness of the stew need rice. We cap our dinner off with Milk Bar Pie al la mode or otherwise known as crack pie. The dessert is a must eat! Super yummy and fucking delicious. The deserts and the pork buns were the best overall.  The service was amazing and everyone was attentive. Plus, the manager was adorable. She came up to our table and checked in on us twice.",

During non normal dining hours, there is a pretty limited menu and we were seated in the bar stool area close to the open kitchen.  We got the ginger noodles, shoyu ramen and the pork belly buns to share. The ginger noodles dish was a good mix of an assortment of vegetables, some of which was a bit spicy.  I was a little bit disappointed with the ramen dish.  The pork belly and shoulder was a huge chunk of dry pork with lot of fat (not the good pork belly kind) that made it almost inedible.  The pork belly was decent, it could have used more flavor and the pork belly was not that tender.  Perhaps I would give it another shot with the formal dining menu.",

My group (of girls in their 20s) was skeptical coming in because the menu seemed to have either cheap eats or expensive af eats. BUT our waiter offered a custom tasting menu, all we had to do was pick a price between $50-100 per person. $50 sounds a little pricer for a bunch of college girls, but we got WAY more than we ever expected, and personally I think way more values worth than $50. and the food is OUT OF THIS WORLD DELICIOUS. They threw dish after dish full of unique, carefully designed plates such as pork belly bao buns, cold cucumber salad (which I didn't think would be good, and a whole fish with kimchi and fried rice. All of us were amazed!! The staff is so kind & the somelier there even gave my friend a free glass of wine.",

Boy did I experience!  Luckily my friend and I were deciding on where to go last minute in Vegas (apparently these days you need reservations to get into the good spots).  Thank you Momofuku for having a reservation time available for us!  I never go too try it in NYC so Vegas you deliver.  We had a smoke salmon dish which was really flavorful.  We actually loved love loved whatever they did to the sides for the dish.  Couldn't even tell what it was but it had some roe, corn, and sunflower seeds.    The Winner of the night for me was the Truffle ramen!!!! Taste buds tickled. I love the punch of truffle flavor in the soup.  It's perfect to share between two people.  This wasn't on the menu so make sure to ask because they will make it!",

The space is spare and modern - expect a fun menu of fusion delights made for sharing.   I opted for spicy cucumbers ($9) which were fresh, light and wonderfully spicy. This would be an amazing start to dinner or a tasty choice for veggie lovers. The Mister opted for a pork bun ($7) which was good but kind of a rip for the price. His shoyu ramen ($17) was really good though - full of nice al dente noodles, a smoky broth and topped with a perfectly poached egg.   If you still have room, they'll charge you $14 for a piece of cake. Vegas, baby.   Who the fuck spends $14 for a slice of cake? Y'all need Jesus.",

Chicken is not dry (was afraid of that)  Didn't get the shoYu pork ramen bc I typically prefer tonkotsu broth. I did get to sample the shoYu broth and it was bombbb. Super duper good just not my broth. Flavorful. I felt like they added something to the broth where it wasn't just shoyu which made me feel like it stands out a bit more than your typical shoyu ramen. Maybe it was umami....\"shrugs\"  Pork belly bun was cooked perfectly. The fat melts in your mouth. It was a nice thick cut and the ratio of bun to meat was just right. Sometimes I feel that there's not enough meat and momofuku did it just right.  I also had their Kalbi beef dish which was also very good. I expected the beef dish to be overpowered by sauces but this dish, you can actually taste the meat. Cooked medium rare, not too chewy. It came with a side of what tasted like pickled mushrooms. I do have to say that I felt that this dish was particularly overpriced for how much you get. You don't get very much for $48. Overall, good dish.  Note to patrons who want to also get dessert here. You can order from the milk bar menu at momofuku, which is nice and convenient.   Servers were attentive and great. They know they menu well and don't just try to up sell you.   Worth visiting! Just a few dishes just feel a little overpriced for what you get (kalbi dish and the shoyu pork ramen).",

We ordered the Pork Belly Buns ($14), Tasting of Country Hams ($28), Jidori Chicken Rice bowl ($17), and the Bo Ssam Rice Bowl ($17).   The pork belly was super thick. It was very crispy and melted in your mouth. Buns were fluffy and delicious. The biscuits were perfectly seasoned and the hams were so flavorful. The mustard added a balance of sweetness to the salty ham. The frozen grapes were a wonderful surprise. They tasted like grape popsicles. The jidori chicken bowl was our least favorite dish of the day. The massive amount of pickled ginger overwhelmed the bowl. It was better when we removed the majority of the ginger. To Bo Ssam pork shoulder was sooooo good. My mouth is watering as I write this review. It was sweet and savory. The kimchee rice, picked cucumbers and onions made this bowl perfect.  Next time We will order the Bo Ssam sharing plate!  My only disappointment was that they were completely full for dinner and we could only enjoy lunch.   We will definitely be back on our next trip or just wish that David Chang would open a restaurant in Honolulu!",

The pork bun was tasty but fatty, and we were happy to only share one. The spicy noodle was pesto based, which I did not expect, but it somehow worked well with the candied pecans. The lamb rack was most delicious..we were sooo happy with our choice. The lamb was frenched perfectly and the meat was so tender it fell off the bone. The yogurt sauce complimented the lamb well.  My friends ordered the Bo Saam ($138 to feed 3-4 people) so I got to try it as well. We were very impressed with the Cook of the pork shoulder. Super tender and flavorful!!! The order also came with 6 oysters, which you are supposed to eat in the lettuce wrap with the pork. The portion was huge and we felt like could have fed more than 4 people. Of course my friends had to get the rest of the shoulder to go. The waitress was nice enough to pack up a set of new sauces and lettuce wraps for us.   Great service and great food. We thought what added a nice touch was when the chef came out and discussed the menu with us! I would want to come back to try other items on the menu, and maybe for lunch as well!",

    "text": "I finally got the chance to try Momofuku in Vegas! We had a large group, so we made a reservation on OpenTable ahead of time. Once we arrived, we were lead to a private room for our party. It was a beautiful room which made our dinner here an excellent dining experience. The staff were also friendly and displayed great customer service. They explained to us the menu options and how they can even create a menu for us at whatever price point we pick. We decided to order individually, but that's a nice option that I wouldn't mind trying next time!  Food that I got include:  Pork Belly Bun (hoisin, scallion, cucumber) - This was an excellent appetizer before my meal. It was delicious and each bite had me wanting more! If you're deciding between this or the shrimp bun, pick the pork belly bun.  Shrimp Bun (spicy mayo, pickled red onion, iceberg) - I had to get another bun after tasting how delicious the pork belly bun was, so I decided to give this a try as well. It was also good, but the pork belly bun is definitely the better of the two.  Chilled Spicy Noodles (sichuan sausage, candied cashew, thai basil) - Noodles with sausage and nuts. The spice level isn't too high, very bearable for people who can't handle that much spicy. Overall, the noodles were great!  Overall, my experience at Momofuku was great. I especially liked the noodles here, they were perfect quality and had plenty of flavors. The staff mentioned that the menu changes routinely, so be open-minded with the menu when coming here. However, the staff were also understanding and after speaking with the chef, we were able to order some items not on the menu, such as the pork ramen. Dinner time at Momofuku is definitely more on the fancy side, so come here for lunch if you want a more casual food experience.",

As I am waiting in a ridiculously long rental car line ( Budget) at the airport in Florida, I am tempted to write a negative review but my stomach is hangry and all I can think about suddenly is this delicious meal I had last month. My favorite was a tie between the salmon and the pork belly and shrimp buns! The bf really enjoyed the lamb dish. The wagyu tri tip was not cooked right, it was way too thick and chewy still and it ended up being the only dish that we didn't finish.   The table next to us was kind enough to share their $300+ fried chicken. Holy chicken, it was amazing. Thank you generous strangers for sharing that dish with us!",

    "text": "For our annual Vegas trip this year, we decided to revisit Momofuku to try the Bossam that we did not get to try on our first trip and it did not disappoint. At $168 dollars and a suggested serving of 4 people, we couldn't believe our eyes when it got to the table. The serving size should probably be more like 6 to 8 people. It's a really good value for money, as well as an amazing take on Bossam.   Bossam is traditionally a boiled pork belly dish that is served with bean paste, pickled veggies (kimichi, etc.) wrapped in lettuce.   David Chang's Bossam is Bossam level 100. The shoulder is marinated in brown/white sugar and salt overnight, and slow roasted in an oven. The result is a pork shoulder that's fork tender, with a lightly salty and sweet crispy skin covering the gelatinous fat and tender, juicy pork. It's truly a gleeful, gluttonous, melt in your mouth burst of flavor. Accompanied by a garlic scallion sauce, rice, butter leaf lettuce, kimchi, hoisin and ssam sauce, and you've got a party of flavor in your mouth. We had four people at our table devouring the shoulder for over two hours. While our appetites are decent (or more on the eyes bigger than stomach side), we were defeated by how much there was. If you have to order one thing, and you've got a large party of 4 or more, order the Bossam. It will not disappoint and is truly a great experience, especially if you are a fan of pork. Oysters were also served on the side of this - which are great if you like oysters.   We also had the opportunity to try a couple of sides on our visit as well.   Shishito Peppers - these were a nice side to break up the fattiness of our meal. They're served covered in a lime salt, which was nice. The spiciness was not consistent throughout the peppers so it was a bit of a spicy roulette. If you enjoy peppers, this dish is decent.   Hearts of Palm and Avocado - this was also a nice salad to pair with the Bossam. It had a light dressing and was a great way to cleanse our palettes and balance out the richness of our meal.   When we came, we also had the opportunity to try an off-menu spicy chicken ramen as well. As I mentioned in my previous review, I was not a fan of the Momofuku pork ramen because of the shoyu-tare broth. However, all my table mates agreed, this ramen was much better than the pork ramen. The ramen had a chicken broth base, with shredded chicken, carrots, green onions and shitake mushrooms. It came with a somewhat spicy sauce, which mixed into the broth made the soup slightly spicy, but also a tad sweet at the same time. The flavors were very balanced and clean. The shitake mushrooms were also well done. The noodles were curly ramen (my fave) and perfectly al dente. This ramen is a great cold weather item to eat or eat even if you're feeling a bit sick. If you come in, do ask for it. They can also make chicken meatballs as an added item for it as well.   Lastly, no meal is complete without dessert right? We tried both the Birthday Cake dessert and cereal milk. While I wasn't wowed by the cereal milk (perhaps because I'm used to the Asian flavored milk soft serves), the Birthday Cake is truly a nostalgic and delicious take on birthday cakes you may have had as a kid. It's light, fluffy with a bit of cake crunch bits. It's sweet, without being overly sweet and frosting is just the right consistency of not being too airy, or too heavy. I highly recommend it.   Shout out to the wait staff who put up with us eating for hours on end. You're the True MVP's.   If you find yourself at Momofuku, don't be afraid to ask your waitstaff for their recommendations. They're highly knowledgeable and will make the effort to make your dining experience at Momofuku a memorable and delicious one.",

One interesting thing that they do with the duck is that they cut it up in front of you after it is fried, then they take the bones and fry them again with some seasoning and bring it back to your table. The double friend bones with a little bit of meat on it was delicious.   Our server was really nice, and service was awesome overall!",

Well if you like oversauced spaghetti, you may want to order this. It's a very confused dish, not Asian, not Italian. Just a bad hybrid. The pork buns were good. The best dish would be the pork chop. Overall, MMFK is overpriced for what you ger. It did not meet out expectations - 5 people in our party. Good for people watching, but not my choice for food!",

Our waiter was very patient with us and suggested to us that he could make us a tasting menu for $50 per person and the table ended up going with this option. The waiter catered to all the diet restrictions we had at the table (pescetarian and lactose intolerant) to make sure that everyone was satisfied with the meal.  We were served several different dishes ranging from veggies to buns to two whoole fish. My favorite dish of them all was the pork belly bao buns, just wow. Everything we were served was super yummy and everyone was happy with the entire experience. The birthday girl even got a special birthday cookie that came from Milk Bar right next door!  I wish I could remember our waiters name, but he was very deserving of a 5-star review.",

I had a bowl of ramen many years ago at your NYC location that was not notable, so this was a pleasant surprise.  Kimchi was legit.  Thank you for providing a bottom-less bowl of lettuce and proper accoutrements to go with the bossam.  Thank you for providing kid size portions of ramen even though Yelp says that it's not a kid friendly restaurant.  The Momofuku labeled sake was respectable and our server Sarah was wonderful.  You're doing a great job at feeding the masses in Las Vegas!  I'm happy for your success even if it means my pocket is $500 lighter after eating at your restaurant.  All the Best!",

    "text": "Came here with a large group.  The decor is nice, a lot of David Choe graffiti art on the walls.  The lazy Susan in the middle of the table was a nice touch and was very useful for family style dining.  We ordered:  1. Truffle and burrata salad - pleasantly surprised how good it was.  The portion was large.    2. Tuna with foie - I would highly recommend this dish.  It was definitely one of our favorites of the night.  The combo of the tuna with the frozen shaved foie on top was excellent.  3. Kampachi - I heard it was good.  I didn't try it, but no complaints from the others.  A small serving.  4. Long beans - Not good.  Overcooked, oily and salty.  We sent it back.    5. Ramen - Even though it's not on the dinner menu, we asked for 2 orders to share.  The consensus was...it was ok.  Nothing special, nothing horrendous.  It was a nice sized bowl.  6. Foie buns - Our server sent us Foie buns, which was off menu and an experimental item.  It was pretty good.  I was scared of the lack of texture of serving foie in a bun, but thankfully they added nuts for a nice crunch.  The seared foie was cut generously and was very rich.   7. Branzino - came whole roasted.  The fish was nicely cooked, and the crisped rice underneath was delicious, however the fish was killed by the over dressed sauce as well as the slathering of kimchi.  The combination of the sauce and kimchi created a salty, spicy mess; you couldn't taste the fish.  I think they should get rid of the sauce, or use less of it.    8. Lamb Ribs - Excellent!  The best dish of the night.  The ribs were cooked perfectly and the yogurt sauce was superb.  A definite hit all around.  9. Lobster thermidor - another off menu item.  Traditional thermidor preparation, but with a generous helping of noodles in the center.  The lobster was huge, and tasty.  I would recommend the dish, but it's quite large.  10.  5 spice duck - Eh.  I think it's difficult to serve duck to basically a table of all Asians who are very used to eating it.  It wasn't a popular dish, and I would find it difficult to recommend.  Although we were quite full by this time, I doubt we even ate a third of it.    Overall, it was a great dining experience.  The service was excellent.",

It's an Asian fusion cuisine and I think if you order their couple few hundred dollars for 4 to 6 ppl it's good for a small family so we ordered two from that menu hoping to feed 8 people which for the most part it did and overall it was satisfying due to protein and rice. Our waiter was cool he demonstrated how to shred meat and put everything together on butter lettuce etc.  With all that said, don't be surprised with the bill though as the tab will set you back a lot for what you think is some fancy sauce with bbq and rice.

    "text": "Who finds time in Vegas to eat? Ummm definitely me!   Cosmopolitan Hotel...one of my favorite hotels in Las Vegas. I have so many bookmarks in Vegas it's hard to decide what to eat. I have a ton of bookmarks just in the Cosmopolitan. So when my friend wanted ramen we came here. I think it was a win, win situation since there was a donut shop across the way and Milk Bar ice cream next-door.   Momofuku was a pleasant surprise. I was expecting to get a quick bite to eat but this restaurant was fancy. My only disappointment was many of the pictures of the dishes on yelp weren't available anymore. Their menu continuously changes so make sure you look at the menu not the pictures online. They can confirm if they have those items still available.  My friend ordered the Ramen and said it was ok but not worth $17, but she's pretty picky. I ordered the crispy potatoes and the Pear & Burrata salad. They were both outstanding. My vote is in and the food is quite delicious. I wasn't very hungry or I would have ordered more. I'm excited to try more of their menu items.   The majority of the service here is outstanding and the restaurant itself is beautiful. Even the bathrooms are fancy with heated toilet seats. If you're at the Cosmopolitan, Momofuku is an excellent option. The only thing you need to keep in mind is it's not going to be cheap. Our bill was $75 and that was with two small appetizers, Ramen and a drink. If that sounds pricey go gambling before dinner so this fancy dinner won't burn your pocketbook.   Drunk or sober Momofuku will still taste good!",

    "text": "One of the best dining experiences of my life.  We were in town for the weekend of April 26 and sat at the chef's bar for 2 lunches in a row (totally unplanned) because we had such a wonderful time and mouthwatering food.    Over the 2 days, we had the pork belly buns, the shishito peppers, the spicy cucumbers, the sweet and sour long beans, the crispy sweet potatoes, the honeycrisp apple salad, the bo ssam bowl, the duck confit fried rice, and the grilled lamb ribs.  Almost everything was superb, the flavors piquant and bright and thrilling and memorable.  I would kill to eat the lamb and pork belly again, and the long beans were surprisingly wonderful. The only dish we were disappointed in was the sweet potatoes, which were a little dry.  And I thought the fried rice, though the tastes were wonderful, was a little heavy in texture; I would've liked the rice grains to be a little fluffier and more separated. But honestly that's just nitpicking; again this was definitely top 10 (and this includes French Laundry, Alinea, Bestia, Bavel, Momofuku New York, Balthazar, Maude, Trois Mec/Petit Trois, Pizzeria Mozza, Chez Panisse (cafe), Alan Wong, Michael Mina, Patina, Redbird - disappointing, Baco Mercat, etc).    Nick the chef was fun to watch and chat with; he answered my questions about the food he was preparing, gave us a little insight into the restaurant, and slipped us a couple of amuse bouches on the side.  I can't wait to go back!!",

    "text": "Momofuku was an experience like no other. It's one that I'll not soon forget and wish I could have regularly. Price wise, it's not a cheap experience, but it's Vegas and it's worth every single penny (dollars) you're going to spend.  So we decided to come here for my birthday. I scoured Yelp for places to go and I kept coming back to this place, something about it just made me feel like I had to experience the food. It looked almost too good to be True. Located on the second floor of the Cosmopolitan Hotel next to Milk, we approached the hostess table. Of course they asked us if we had a reservation, sadly we didn't, but they told us it wouldn't be more than 15 minutes- phew! Eventually we were taken to our seat, which happened to be at their bar area. Now typically I would have asked for a table, even if it meant a longer wait, but I was feeling like gambling (and a little drunk at the time) so I was relaxed, and figured I'd just go with it. And thank goodness I did.  Our waiter at the bar was phenomenal. He walked through the menu with us and explained everything in such detail. They either train their employees extremely well or this guy is an encyclopedia of all things food and Momofuku because he was like Rain Man with his knowledge of ingredients and flavors. It was perfect.  Beverage:  I only had one drink here (because I had so many others earlier in the day). I opted for their Bok to the Beet. For $17, you'll receive probably the most refreshing alcoholic beverage of your life. If you're a gin-lover, get this now. It's gin, beet, blood orange, and bok choy. None of them I'd mix together normally, but it was absolutely delicious.  Appetizers:  We had two appetizers before dinner: 1. The spicy cucumbers. Never have $9 cucumbers tasted so good. And never did I think spending $9 on cucumbers seem worth-while until I tried these. Featuring this togarashi spice, toasted almonds and an avocado-like paste/sauce, these cucumbers were the perfect blend of spicy and salt. You literally want to lick the bowl clean. We didn't, but that doesn't mean we didn't want to. 2. The pork belly bun. Wow. Wow. Wow. $14 gets you two of the tastiest pork belly buns out there. I loved the hoisin sauce; it was the perfect amount and of course, you could get more if you needed it. The bun is also topped with scallion and cucumber- more cucumber!!!!  Dinner:  Now the real treat was dinner. And that's saying something because everything prior was outstanding. We ordered the Salt and pepper lobster & shrimp. Menu price is $268 and feeds three to four people, but you can do a half order for, you guessed it, half of the cost! So our order came with three lobster tails, 9 shrimp ( these beautiful jumbo shrimp), all battered in this amazing tempura then fried with copious amounts of garlic and chilies. Oh, and that's not all, it's finished with oyster sauce and condensed milk. My photos don't do it justice. It was amazing. If you're any type of seafood lover, this is truly a treat. I felt so badly leaving any remnants of the meal because I wanted every bite to be gone. The chilies were amazing and not spicy like I would have imagined. The lobster tails were delicious as well. Nothing bad at all. Everything we tasted was truly out of this world.  Overall this was an amazing experience on so many levels. I couldn't imagine it getting any better than this. This experience at Momofuku really helps you understand the phrase, \"you get what you pay for\" because the food isn't cheap, but you will not regret it one bit.  Also- they partner with Milk Bar next to it so you can get a little sweet treat from Milk brought over to you at Momofuku. As if you needed yet another reason to love this place.  A+ dining experience and I really can't wait to come back here and explore more items on their menu. I hope you love it as much as I did.",

Enough said.   But seriously though, the crunch that the toasted almond added, the depth of flavor.. I couldn't get enough and I  didn't know I needed these cucumbers in my life.  ENTREE: The schezuan spicy beef noodles were ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!! Definitely not your typical ramen, imagine a spaghetti bolognese with schezuan spice and better noodles! Each noodle was coated perfectly in the thick sauce with red oil, I almost licked the plate clean I kid you not. We also had the ginger noodles with chicken that was <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fgrilled.to&s=382f1db2b1d980d654002f3ba92a250d300096454afd0dbf3a092a101144ebd1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">grilled.to</a>.perfection. The sauce was thick and flavorful with a pretty strong ginger taste (without the kick) that builds as you continue to eat so be wary if you're not a fan of ginger, I loved it!   *Certain foods may not be available depending on the time of day. There are family style meals for around $250 but it seems like a lot of food..now that I've eaten there, if I came back with a group I'd definitely splurge.  ATMOSPHERE: Located on the 2nd floor of the cosmopolitan near egg slut. It's modern, sleek, with an open kitchen..filled with talented chefs.  Will save all my coins and be back!",

NOOOO. Now as you grab the apple slice you will smear the edge of your apple into the maple labne (soft rich and creamy think Greek yogurt texture) and it cools the heat of the kimchi.....  Oh man the sea bass with miso is just stupid it is simply perfect the very very lightly sweet and salty pairing in the miso is on a different level...

    "text": "I don't get the hype.  At all.   This was our first meal in Vegas this week and I was really expecting to have a great dinner.  With all these positive reviews, I assumed it would be good.   We ordered the pork buns, cold garlic noodles, an octopus appetizer, and spicy rice cakes (last two not on their menu, it was their special of the day)  Every dish, except the pork buns, was spicy.  And even that came with a side of very vinegary spicy sauce.   I liked the pork buns, never have I tasted such well seasoned, well cooked slab of thick pork belly.  Everything else was..... bad.   The texture of the octopus was great.  The burnt flavor was strong, but the consistency of the legs were really soft and chewy.  The flavor..... not so much.  Think butter mixed with Tabasco and sour burnt flavor.  The texture of the cold garlic noodles were good, but the flavor.. eh.  Think mint/cilantro mixed with peanuts and spicy chili peppers.  The rice cake was cooked deliciously, they were semi fried it or something where it was crispy and chewy (very different from the original, nonetheless delicious) the flavor.... blah.  Think vinegar with spicy sauce and butter  I was scraping the sauce and seasonings off the main ingredient of all the dishes except the pork buns.  It's like someone went into an Asian American home and just started mixing all the seasonings in the cupboard onto a dish.   You can't exactly pinpoint what the flavors are because there is sooo much going on, it's salty, sour, spicy, and buttery all at once but not the same flavor for each dish.    I recommend the pork buns.  Maybe the family style dishes are better, there were many large parties when we went.   But I don't think I'll go with just my bf again.",

    "text": "Went here for dinner on a Wednesday night around 9pm. Place was fairly happening. I would suggest a reservation. Overall a good experience. I would go again to try different things.  Ambiance: typical hype vibe you would expect from Cosmo. People were dressed up as well as casual. There appeared to be an area for a big group if you need one.  Service: really good. Server came right out and explained the menu. Even gave me some sample sake to try out. Her recommendations were pretty good. Food. Some out in a timely fashion. Waters were refilled throughout.  Food: I was excited to try David Chang's food. The menu was pretty simple. The server mentioned that some of the items were not his classic things (i.e. Ramen) and he was trying to make it more \"west coast\". I felt that some of the items did not live up to the hype. We had the soft boiled egg. Not really a deviled egg and kinda salty with the salmon roe. Next we tried the scallop poke. It was interesting indeed. Kinda creamy/salty. I probably wouldn't get it again and prefer the more basic poke. The yellowtail sashimi was pretty good. Not fishy at all and very flavorful. We opted to try the cold chili noodle. This was one of the highlights. The amount of heat was just right. Tons of sausage. It was also a good portion. Great flavor. Finically, I had the pork bun. The pork was nice and fatty. Cooked perfectly. The bun was light and soft. Just the right amount of hoisin sauce. I would love to try the other buns. Overall, food was great but not outstanding. I would return to try some of the other items",

    "text": "Momofuku Las Vegas is the joint.  There's not a lot of bargains to be found on the strip, and even fewer in the Cosmo where this restaurant is located, but you can get a great meal at a reasonable price for Vegas.  It's Ramen, so it shouldn't be outrageous.  The shishito peppers are absolutely the best I've ever had, and I order them basically any time there on a menu in front of me.  This menu doesn't mention their secret ingredient, only saying \"smoke salt and lime.\"  Chang's are tossed with nutritional yeast and while I could never picture how that would work with the pepper flavor, it's a stroke of genius.  Having been here before, I had to go twice in the 5 nights I was here recently, dragging as many coworkers with me as I could round up.  None of them was let down by any part of their meal.    The Pork Ramen does not appear on the dinner menu, only on the lunch and late night menus.  They dress it up with black truffle on the dinner menu and sling it for $50 or so.  No thanks.  I'm sure it's lovely, but for $50 I'm not eating ramen.  If you ask for the Pork ramen they'll still serve it at dinner time, and it's just outstanding.  I'm not sure how they get the egg to that consistency, it must be magic.  When you slice into it with your chopstick it's like an egg-asm in your bowl. The Dashi is every bit as good as you'd expect if you know who David Chang is.  The buns are great too, and if you have a few friends ready to share the menu offers family style meals like Bo Saam , an incredible roast pork dish for about $140, or fried chicken with caviar that you can spend $1500 on if you're a high roller or too drunk to read the prices.  This extravagance is offset by the Miller High Life that was the beer special a few months back.  Overall I love the vibe here, the food is outstanding, and it's a beacon of comfort food in a hot shot hotel that was a welcome surprise for me.  Enjoy!",

The pork buns are definitely worth trying even though it's seven dollars for one of them. I personally don't think it's worth getting the Ramen here. But I have to say my review is up because I'm craving the pork belly bun with the special sauce. There are a lot of places to eat within Vegas but if you really need some pork bun then it's worth a try other than that you can get really good food for a better price.",

We got seated at the bar right away which I didn't expect since I thought we needed reservations.  We had really good service and the waiter took time to explain everything and was really nice about suggesting a few items for us.    Sitting at the bar was fun since we got to see them manning the deep fry section which makes things like the long beans and shishito peppers.   Sadly I don't remember the waiters name but I do know that the line cook, Aaron, Aron?, was also really good about checking up on us.  We even got a free sample after the expediter saw us pointing at something and he had them give us a sample.    Really good: Brussel sprouts - fried till crispy and mixed with like 10 things; its definitely a flavorful dish. Mussels Crack pie - its pretty tiny for the price and its overly sweet but its good. Good: Rotisserie chicken - the waiter made it sound better than it was but it was still a solid dish.  We asked for more kim chi but they only give it if you buy more.  Meatballs with beans - the bacon is very prominent.  This is a hardy dish, no wonder it cost $18.   Pork Buns - but nothing that normal chinese places serve and charge less for cereal milk ice cream - lighter than what I expected from a soft serve.   Skip: spicy rice cakes - maybe its because I don't like rice cakes so I didn't care for this dish",

We got the shrimp bah mi, pork belly bah mi, beet salad, pork ramen and the chicken. Evrything was to die for. As simple as the bah mi is, it's packed with flavor. The pork ramen was so so so good, broth was very flavorful and the pork belly, don't get me started  . The chicken was so good too!!

Lamb ribs were a 10/10 would order again -- crunch on the outside really tender on the inside, right amt of fat, super tasty yogurt and cucumber to contrast the lamb. Shiitake bun had an awesome texture and flavor mushrooms were unfortunately wayyyyyy to salty as was the chickpea ramen. The ramen had an amazing flavor with great texture to the noodles the issue was the broth was so salty it was unenjoyable and we left most of it behind.

We ordered the spicy cucumber salad (creamy, fresh, a little spice), pork bun (perfection), mushroom bun (seriously, texture on the mushrooms was divine), lamb (how is it so perfect, not a spice out of line and all flavors working together delightfully), and mushroom noodles (starchy, hearty, yummy). Oh, absolutely get the \"flask\" it's like 4 drinks in one and you get to keep the flask - aromatic, well-balanced, a very nice drink. Had to deduct a star after trying our two neighboring tables' food. The branzino was past it's \"best by\" date and a little fishy, its sauce wasn't as balanced as the flavors on our table. The pesto with the sausage noodles wasn't an expected combination, but it was fine. The flank steak, I couldn't even finish the small bite shared with me it was so tough and flavorless. No joy in that dish. Salt+pepper seafood was salty as expected. I saw a table send back the shishito peppers for being far too salty, but I didn't try them. I could visually see the salt-dusting on top was excessive. If I hadn't tried the other tables' food, this would be a 5-star food+experience review. I was surprised to find disappointment in the other dishes, since what we ordered was so delightful. Since the fun dishes are all for 4-6 people, we'll have to bring some friends back with us next time to try them out. Wish they had some portion sizes geared toward parties of two. Hopefully they'll consider adding that option to the menu in the future.",

The food was consistently great but the service at this location was off the charts. My group sat at the bar and lost track of time and the staff never nudged us or gave us dirty looks but rather were totally welcoming. It was exceptional service and I am totally impressed.  Go here for a meal and service you will remember!",

And, the damn menu changes, so what you think is a staple that you see on Yelp is not available when you get there, i.e., truffle ramen and ramen eggs. Boo. Awesome wait staff. So-so hostesses out front. Probably wouldn't return, even though I love watching Chef David Chang on Netflix. Haven't given up on him, yet. Will try Ko before deciding whether or not to give up altogether.",

That was just the beginning of great service. Our server and other people serving in the dining area were all friendly and pleasant. Water glasses are always filled, your napkin is folded when you leave the table, they ask if you have questions. The place does get loud but the decor is beautiful. I love the view of the strip from our table. They have a seating area that you climb some steps to get too and there is a sliding sort of wooden window that they can close for privacy if you have a private party or open for just casual dining.  We ordered (1) chicken karaage buns - the burst of flavors in this bun is wonderful. The bun itself is soft and sweet which contrast perfectly against the crispiness and  savory flavor of the chicken. This is a must! (2) Spicy Sichuan Rice Cakes - pork sausage, broccoli, crispy onions. We had no idea what to expect with this dish and it surprised us in a great way. The mix of textures and flavors are amazing. A winner. (3) Pork Ramen - pork belly & shoulder, slow poached egg. This is not the ramen I am accustomed to. It is not as fatty and flavorful as the tonkotsu ramen that I prefer but it was also good. I love how al dente the noodle is.  If you are from the West Coast and have been waiting to try chef David Chang's creation, you must visit Momofuku at Cosmopolitan. Don't forget to make a reservation.",

My party was lucky enough to be seated with a great view of the strip including the Paris Eiffel Tower which was a nice touch.   Service: attentive and always refills water. But they didn't serve water with ice or offer it--odd.   Food: Pork Ramen - get if you love the taste of pork with a smokey tasting broth which could be due to the addition of pulled pork.   Spicy Sichuan Rice - it says it comes with pork sausage and broccoli with onions but you won't find sausage that looks like whole sausage. The sausage is cut in small pieces which for me gets drowned with the vision of onions. Broccoli also seems non existent as you don't see whole broccoli or even florets of it. Must've been cut into really small pieces. Tho, the rice is crispy which is nice.   Pork Bao bun - 1 bun is pretty filling on its own. Pretty good. Would recommend at least trying it.",

The restaurant space looks a lot smaller than it actually is from the outside.  Once you enter and make a right, there's a larger, bright space with more tables and a view of that side of the strip.  Service was really great from everyone, our waiter was really nice, helpful and attentive.  The whole experience was superb.  My husband got the pork bun and LOVED it.  I got the roasted mussels and fried brussels sprouts.  The roasted mussels were tasty, sprinkled with their special furikake.  The fried brussels spouts were packed with flavor but were definitely on the oily side.  But overall, the dishes were really good.  I definitely would recommend you to try it out. Dessert is all from Milk next door so that was a little disappointing.  I've never been to the other Momofuku but if it's like this location I'm sure I would love it.  I would definitely come back the next trip to Vegas.",

The ramen was decent, the only thing special about the ramen was the ridiculously good pork belly.   Shishito peppers didn't taste much like anything.  The chicken katsu with shiitake mushroom gravy was sour. It could have been great. The katsu was good and the gravy tastes good initially, but then the sour vinegar taste sets in and it's all you taste.  There are so many other places much more deserving of your time and money. Come for the best pork belly you've ever had but don't expect anything else here to be good.",

Review before update-   Yummy noodles but a bit annoyed because we came for lunch and it wasn't crowded but our drinks took forever to get our drinks. Pretty much when we were done eating.

Here, my husband & I shared the shrimp buns, the shishito peppers & the ginger scallion noodles with chili oil. We really enjoyed the buns but the peppers & noodles were okay at best. The peppers were not worth $9. The ginger flavor in the noodles doesn't stand out & the chili oil has zero spiciness to it. I don't know if it was the time of day we came (3:30pm) or the fact that were very busy but I've had better noodles elsewhere. I would honestly try the other locations in NYC if you can but don't recommend this one.",

I went to Momofuku in NYC a couple of years ago and FELL IN LOVEEEE with their pork belly bun. probably the best I've had in life (so far)!!    I have visited this Las Vegas location twice now and had the pork buns both times. the first time the pork belly melted in my mouth and was soft and tender, reminding me of my experience in NYC. The second time here, the pork was not as tender but still good and great flavor. The server recommended the Chicken bun saying it was their top seller, so I tried one of those too. I feel the chicken had a bit too much batter but a good Asian flavor ( I think it had a hint of ginger in there). Overall.... Pork Bun Over Chicken and everything else I will probably always make a stop here anytime I'm in Vegas for a pork bun or 2.",

The ramen I was not happy with. The pork belly was amazing, and the noodles were very good, but the broth was very thin like a clear chicken soup or udon broth, not very tonkotsu like at all. I get that his ramen is different, but I was hoping for the rich almost creamy tonkotsu broth with this ramen. That being said, it was tasty, but not what I wanted or expected. I did not get a chance to try the pork belly buns, but given how awesome the pork belly was in the ramen, I will be back to try that. I will not be back for ramen, did not satisfy my craving. Some of the best ramen in the country is just up the road at Monta Ramen in Vegas... it beats all the best places in LA and NYC in my opinion.",

    "text": "Momofuku is located on the 2nd floor by the Chandelier Bar in the Cosmo. Walk-in tables and bar seating in the front. No outdoor seating. Open for dinner only during the first couple of weeks.  *~Our Order on 1/22/2017~* Pork Belly Bun: ($14) hoisin, scallion, cucumber Chicken Karaage Bun: ($14) spicy mayo, pickled red onion, iceberg Shiitake Bun: ($12) hoisin, scallion, cucumber Pommes Puree: ($8) Kimchi Stew: ($24) pork shoulder, rice cakes, roasted onion Ginger Scallion: ($17) pickled shiitake, cucumber, wakame Pork Ramen: ($18) pork belly & shoulder, slow poached egg Black Winter Truffle Ramen: ($58) perigord truffles, egg yolk  The pork belly in the bun is fairly thick and not too crispy (which I like but one person in our prefers it to be crispy). Some people in the group actually preferred the Chicken Karaage bun over the Pork Belly. Wouldn't order the Shiitake Bun again (even though I love mushrooms). Same goes for the Truffle Ramen. Even though it was very fragrant, the broth completely overpowered and you could barely taste the truffles. The mashed potatoes were very light & airy, and actually pretty good. BF regretted ordering the Ginger Scallion ramen. Everyone else said their dishes were \"ok\" but wouldn't go out of their way to eat again. We did like the QQ (or \"bite\") of the noodles tho. If we HAD to come back we would only order the buns, but for about $7/bun, we didn't feel it was worth it.  Getting seated was an absolute nightmare (and why the 1 star)! I came at 5:15PM since they open the doors at 5:30PM and saw that no one was in line yet. I had a flight to catch and wanted to see if our group of 9 would be able to get seated earlier than our 6PM reservation time (only 30min earlier).  I was told no as they were \"setting up the table.\" I was debating if we should just sit at the bar for walk-ins (they didn't have any tables for larger than a group of 4 in the front end) but as I told the hostess of the time restraint, I thought we would get seated in time. We even gave the hostess all of our orders so that the food would be ready by the time we would get seated.   BIG MISTAKE. We should've just sat at the bar. Only after many inquires about when we were going to be seated, we got seated 25min AFTER our reservation time. Our table was in the very back of the restaurant and we saw that ALL the tables were already setup and not even 1/4 of the restaurant was full. Our entire group was baffled as to why we couldn't be seated earlier. THEN, when the waitress asked for our order and we informed her that we already submitted it with the hostess, our waitress found out it was never entered. By now, everyone was starving and fed up with the experience and was on the verge of leaving. Our waitress said that luckily the items we would like to order would not take long so we were convinced to stay. One of our friends (who used to be a manager of a high-end hotel) insisted on speaking to a manager tho and the only response we got from the manager was, \"I'm sorry but I don't know what to tell you.\" Service right there folks! The chef did send out a pickle plate as an \"apology\" but after a taste, no one really cared for any of the pickled items (even my BF who LOVES pickles!).  NO ONE in our group said they would return. Not sure how service can be so poor when one of their restaurants was able to get two Michelin stars. Shame since we're in Vegas many times in a year.",

Really enjoyed his show on Netflix ugly delicious and I really wanted to try out Momofuku when I had a trip scheduled to Vegas. This location is in he Cosmopolitan and is right next to Milk bar. Very awesome environment and really good music playing in the restaurant. Nothing is better to eat noodles while Wu Tang is playing  When we got there, it was a lunch menu which was very limited but had want I wanted to try out. We ordered the shishito peppers, pork belly buns, ginger scallion noodles and the spicy fried chicken sandwich. Lots of items but each could be shared.  Starting with the shishito peppers, they're good but nothing too special about them. Kind of a standard pepper with an added taste of salt and lime. Probably won't be something I would order next time  The pork belly buns are a super thick cut of pork belly with a hoisin sauce and super delicious spicy cucumbers wrapped in a nice soft bun. Really awe dish and pretty filling in my opinion. Order these!  I really came here to try out the ginger scallion noodles and they are really good. They have a nice mix of mushrooms, scallions, wakame with a really delicious ginger garlic sauce. The noodles tasted great but I think I ate the noodles incorrectly at first. I felt like it needed a little more sauce on the entire dish but I found out you should of mixed the entire dish to really get that delicious sauce on everything. Maybe there should of been so instructions on how to make them but I figured it out eventually. Once the who dish was mixed with the sauce, it was delicious! Great dish for sure  The Spicy Fried Chicken sandwich sounded super good and to be honest It was so good! The size of the sandwich isn't too big, but the taste was for sure excellent! It has this pepper sauce that reminds me of gochujang sauce with a nice bite from the cucumbers. Perfectly fried chicken with a nice bun. All around a good dish!  All in all, good restaurant and looking forward to try out some dishes next time with the full menu. Also don't forget to try out Milk bar after",

    "text": "Thank you again, David Chang! I usually frequent his noodle bar whenever I am in New York City to order the pork belly buns. This Las Vegas of Momofuku is like a mixture of Ssam bar and his noodle bar. There are many Momofuku staples on the menu such as the pork buns and truffle ramen.   The restaurant is large and has a lot of room for open kitchen bar seating. I personally ordered the pork buns and they did not disappoint at all, really tasty! For my entree, I ordered the tomahawk pork chop that was accompanied with yams. The pork chop Tasted like a steak and was grilled to perfection.  The prices are reasonable and the same as the NYC locations. For dessert, they are located right next to milk bar (Christina Tosi's baby). Milk bar serves the milk bar staples like cereal milk, crack pie, and the layered confetti cake. It's like a Momofuku family in cosmo",

The truffle ramen was delicious, but I love truffle and not everyone does so unless you love truffle flavor I wouldn't get it because it's very forward on the truffles.    We also got the short rib stew and the burrata in the stew was a nice touch, but with my wife being Korean and making a similar type stew (without the burrata) it wasn't as impressive a dish to me.  Everything tasted great and service was excellent!",

We ordered the pork ramen, pork buns, ginger scallion noodles, and the honeycrisp apple salad.   The pork ramen was alright. I wish it could've been warmer and the soup was pretty salty. It wasn't bad but it wasn't that great either.   The worst part of my experience was the ginger scallion noodles. This is seriously the worst dish so PLEASSSEEE DO NOT ORDER!!!!! This dish was so salty. It was miserable to eat and bite into the dish. We ended up eating not even half of the dish because it tasted so bad. Every bite was so salty and I couldn't understand why they would choose to put this dish out on the menu from a restaurant by David Chang.   Another reason why I was so disappointed by this restaurant was the honeycrisp apple salad. This dish was literally sliced apples with marinated kimchi on the apples. It was literally sliced apples and they charged $16 for it. Are you kidding me?!?!  The only reason I gave this place two stars was for the pork buns and the service. It's a bummer that most of the food we ordered were so salty.  I honestly don't think this place is worth the money.",

She had great suggestions on the menu and was even able to get us a half order of the salt and pepper lobster and shrimp. This dish usually serves 3-4, so being a party of 2, it would have been too much food. The place wasn't as busy so we were able to enjoy the half portion thanks to D and the kitchen.  We started off with the pork belly buns, which was a perfect starter. The pork belly was perfectly cooked and the pickled cucumbers couple perfectly with the fatty meat. We also ordered the cold chili garlic noodles, which had an amazing flavor but were SPICY! The spice goes away as you move on to other parts of the meal, but if you can't handle spice...this isn't the dish for you. We enjoyed all the food and chased it with the Yuzu lemonade and a wicked garden drink. Both were tart and tasty. Lastly, we ended the night with the crack pie a la mode from the mill bar. The thin delicious pie and the cereal milk ice cream wrapped up a perfect meal.  This has definitely been one of our favorite dining experiences in Las Vegas. It really makes a difference when not only the food is good. But the service is immaculate and curated for each guest! Highly recommended!",

    "text": "Second Time here always with large group.  Up front - they are pricey, so not for the faint of wallet. As for the quality, let's start from the top.  Service: They are always busy, but they have a lot of people on the floor, so it's not hard to get the attention of anyone. However, since they are busy, our actual waitress only occasionally checked in on us.  4/5  Drinks: Quite delicious - they have a large selection, but we stuck with mixed drinks A few looked quite interesting and unique, but we stuck to some classics - whiskey and thyme & honey ginger gin. Overall, great drinks and served quickly.  They did not have any beer, it was a bit odd to hear - they said it would take AN HOUR to get a keg open, so taking a point off for that  4/5  Food: We got a large selection of food, so I'll list them out: Shishito peppers Green beans Special rice cake Scallion noodles Rack of lamb Pork shoulder  The appetizers came pretty quickly - great service and the quality of the peppers was great actually. Always get these. The green beans were cooked in sweet and sour sauce and MAN did they have a strong flavor. Great to start with!  The scallion noodles hit the spot - they added shiitake mushrooms, so there was a good amount of meatiness to them.  The lamb came after - a bit small for a full rack in my opinion. We asked for the sauce on the side. Lamb itself tasted great, but I'm glad the sauce was separate since the lamb tasted better without.  We had some rice cakes, super spicy!  The pork shoulder came last. Comes with oysters and MAN is this guy huge and good tasting. MUST HAVE. 5/5 for food  Overall I rate the place a 4.5/5 But since I can't give partial reviews on Yelp, it is getting a 4/5 total.",

I came here only one time and it was with a large group.  We didn't order very many items though because we weren't ready to splurge on so little.  (Eg, prime rib was $100, so we'd be paying $10 for a tiny tiny piece of meat.)  PORK BELLY BUN.  The menu says an order includes two buns, but our waitress let us order single ones for the same price ($7 each).  Everyone in my group got one - some even ordered two.  EVERYONE loved this.  I would say it's a must try!  They offered a special sauce with gochujang as the base, but I didn't like it very much.  I would have preferred normal gochujang to eat with the bun for that spicy kick.  MISO BLACK COD.  This one was like $50-some, but came out to like four pieces.  I only got to try a tiny bit, but it was soo salty.  The mushrooms and greens were ok but salty as well.  I never drink water (it makes me full), and I actually finished my glass.  COLD CHILI GARLIC NOODLES.  $16 for a bowl.  The fried garlic toppings and chopped chilies made the dish.  I loved the flavor.  I forgot that you have to ask for the ramen because it's on a secret menu... I'll have to try it again on my next Vegas trip!  Service was really good.  We had two people waiting on us, which may have been extra, but soo helpful!",

I have had plenty of cucumber salads at Japanese and Asian restaurants and these were quite different but very good! I loved the crunch of the toasted almonds on top. Lastly we ordered the ham sampler, which was very, very thin slices of two types of ham. That came with delicious biscuits and like a mustard like sauce. I am usually not a fan at all of ham in any forms but these slices were similar to carpaccio and were AMAZING!   Overall great food and service!

    "text": "Given how many reviews are praising the pork belly buns, I got a little hyped up and now I gotta be critical about them.  Is the flavor good? Yes I'm not going to deny that. However, the Pork to everything else ratio is so terrible that I think it brings it down! Its a HUGE serving of pork belly (which helps justify its price), but many does it feel unbalanced as a dish.  You have to HOPE that your pork's meat to fat ratio and distribution is good, otherwise, you're bites consist of a really fatty, delicate bites, or really lean meat bites.  For some, that is a draw, for me, it feels like they are not harmonizing with each other and giving me the best of both worlds (or, I have to inhale the whole thing in one bite, which is a choking hazard :) )  Related to that, I don't feel like there is enough, or strong enough pickles that help cut through the fattiness and really brighten it up.  Anecdotally, when I make Pork belly buns, I make quick pickled red onions which can cut right through the fattiness if you need to refresh your palette. The bun itself is barely large enough to contain the pork belly as well.  If I had the choice, I would make it half as thick; more opportunity to increase the char to meaty/fatty ratio, and a couple more pickles.  Again, that's just my taste.   Especially if y'all are leading into the the ramen which itself is can be very rich.  I had the Bo Ssam bowl which is excellent and I highly recommend btw.  Great variety of flavors and textures!",

The prices are a little high but it's Vegas so what do you expect. It's about $20+ per person not including drinks.  The shishito peppers were tasty. they were very soft (not crispy at all) and showered with some dried lime seasoning. My parents usually don't like eating peppers straight but they liked these. Also note that about 10% of shishito peppers are spicy so it's like playing roulette!  I got the cold garlic noodles and thought they were decent. It got spicy the more you eat it! I thought the sauce was a pinch too sweet but other than that it was good. The chicken was an extra $6 but I liked how flavorful the chicken was. It was a pinch too dry in some cases but flavor was good.  The jidori chicken bowl had similar chicken and it was tasty.  The ramen bowl seemed to be under seasoned according to 3 people who got ramen at my table.  If you get water for the table they use Vero water which tastes really good. It tastes so pure!",

Pork belly buns were good just like most places I had elsewhere so can't say I need to come back to Vegas for pork belly buns at momofuku.   I didn't really like shoyu pork bowl. The flavor was a bit off/bland. The slab of pork belly was sad, not much. And I hate the idea of having to pay extra for vegetables or whatever that's needed to make the entree taste right. If it needs certain ingredients to make it taste better it should be included and bring up the price instead of making it look cheap then after all the add ons it costs more.   Bosam bowl was interesting, sticky rice colored with kimchi sauce, can't say I didn't like it but it was nothing out of this world where I can say I want to come back for more!   This location is on the same floor and right next to Eggslut. It was not as busy when we were here compared to eggslut so that was a plus.  Service was fast and friendly but that alone may not bring me back.",

I wasn't completely sold because a lot of Vegas hot spots don't live up to its hype. Well this place definitely was worth the long wait and price.    Location is in an odd corner of the cosmopolitan and the decor is basic but I liked it because it allows focus on the open kitchen. The staff immediately were very friendly and recommended several items.   First the bartender recommended the Spicy cucumbers and those were amazing. Also suggested a mixed drink which I think of was gin and beet juice but whatever it was i was impressed and could have had several...I didn't at 17 bucks. I went in because I have because David Chang always talks about ramen on his show. Well he didn't do it wrong. I choose the pork ramen and the roasted pork was to die for and add pork belly it can't get any better. The whole bowl was perfect and one of the most flavorful and rich broth I have had.   Honestly the ramen was something i could eat everyday. Definitely worth the stop to check it out. But make reservations.  If you have a large group there are larger dishes to enjoy as a group.   Definitely put this in your list.",

    "text": "This is a tough review for me to write. I will start by saying that I stan for all things David Chang. I've been reading about him since he started the first Momofuku in New York. I watched the Mind of a Chef and Ugly Delicious. I listen to the podcast (it got much better!).   So when we rounded the corner in the Cosmopolitan in Vegas, and saw Momofuku, I was in awe. We didn't have reservations, we weren't dressed for the experience (I was wearing flip flops from driving all day), but somehow we were seated.   You have to start a review of this place with the food, because that's what it's all about, right? Well, we ordered the pork belly buns (appetizer), the Sichuan beef noodles, and the half order of the Salt & Pepper Lobster & Shrimp.   So let's start with the sublime. The pork belly buns were exactly what I dreamed of; perfect. I could have just eaten those all night. Given what came next, I probably should have. Seriously, though- they were amazing.  Next, the decent. When I tasted the Sichuan beef noodles, I got it. I was like, \"Oh yeah, it's spaghetti in meat sauce! That's clever!\" And then ... that was it. This was a clever concept, a bite, turned into a larger meal.   Finally, the Salt & Pepper Lobster & Shrimp. First, the \"half portion\" is massive. Huge. Too much for us. And even though it says it is tempura (fried) I guess I didn't internalize just how much fried stuff was coming. But while the old rules of food (a. everything tastes better fried; b. everything tastes better on a stick) might be True, this was ... eh, I wasn't a huge fan. There was no real variety. I would definitely not order this one again, or recommend it.  The cocktails, by the way, are worth getting. Inventive and delicious. The Don Collins was really good, but the What the Pho was amazing.   So, all that said, in terms of the food quality for the money I would rate Momofuku three stars, as much as it pain me. Had we ordered something else, maybe it would be different. So ... why four stars?  Because of the six-star service. It was impeccable. Despite our attire from traveling, the hostesses seated us at a bar table. The commis waiter silently glided by filling our water and dealing with our dishes. Our server was perfectly poised, friendly, and helpful, coming by enough to give us attention but not too much in order to give us space to talk and enjoy the meal. And the bartender, who brought over a drink, stopped and cracked some jokes and made us feel welcome.  In short, it was perfect service. I just wish we had ordered different dishes.",

Popped in here for a late lunch and sat in a booth in the window over-looking the strip. As expected being a few floors up, the view was very quintessential Vegas, and perfect for a tourist like me.  I didn't stray from my usual pork ramen order, but I did also enjoy a spicy ceviche, avocado salad and green beans in sesame. I am the worst with menu names, but hopefully these descriptions help you out... because honestly you should just copy this exact order.",

    "text": "Momofuku is not just about the food. David Chang's vision for a restaurant experience is embodied from the moment you walk into the elegant, modern dining room and from every interaction with the amazingly attentive servers. Our water glasses were never left unfilled for more than a couple minutes at a time, and our servers were all so friendly and helpful with recommendations as well. Of course, the food did not disappoint!  We started our dinner with the shrimp buns, which consisted of a chunky, hot shrimp patty along with spicy mayo, pickled red onion, and iceberg lettuce on a soft white bao--what a flavor combination! Our server even brought over a tiny squeeze bottle of ssam sauce for the shrimp buns, and the sauce added the perfect touch of sweet and spicy flavor!  Even though the ramens technically aren't on the dinner menu, our server allowed us to order it anyway; the shoyu pork ramen, which came with a rather light broth, pork belly, pork shoulder, and a poached egg was executed perfectly, though I didn't find it all that memorable. But by far my favorite dish was the mind-blowingly delicious chilled spicy noodles. These green noodles were flavored with a thai basil pesto dressing, along with pickled jalapenos, lean Sichuan sausage, and candied cashews. Oh my goodness.. I savored every last bite and drop of sauce of this dish that combined spicy, salty, acidic, meaty, umami, and herbal flavors, along with an awesome crunchiness and nutiness that were simply unparalleled! Amazing!!  Come, come, come for the amazing food and amazing service. Momofuku is wonderful for a reason--the chef really cares about each aspect of the restaurant experience, and the dishes are prepared with the utmost creativity and finesse!",

They were good portions and we were full at the end. Overall was a peasants experience, but the food was not as good as expected; probably could have the same at a regular restaurant at much cheaper price.

    "text": "So, I've been a fan of Momofuku for a long time. Especially Milk Bar, but I've also been a fan of their other concepts (Ko, Noodle Bar, etc.) So on my trip to Vegas, when I heard Momofuku was opening a Vegas output in the Cosmopolitan Las Vegas-- my BF and I decided to make a reservation (which we found at the last minute!) and ended up being pleasantly surprised with the quality of food. Vegas Momofuku is much larger than its counterparts and has a larger menu. It comes large format dining menus from several concepts and offers about 5 choices. Since there were only two of us and I'm allergic to crustaceans, we opted out of the large format dining.  We dined for around $100 per person and got: - Pork belly buns: Always a classic. Large pieces of pork.  - Ginger-Scallion Noodles: Add the ssam (spicy) sauce to this. The noodles themselves don't have much of a taste, but the cucumbers add salt, the seaweed adds umami and the mushrooms are pickled so they add a nice acidity. Adding the ssam flavours the noodles and elevates the flavours further. The cucumber and acidity cut the spiciness. Huge recommend. - New York Strip: AMAZING. The bone marrow is subtle but there is this beautiful brown butter... almost dashi like sauce? You only get it in doses but it's perfect. One of my faves. This is the cheaper version of the Wagyu they offer for $115 lol. This was only $60ish excl. tip -Chicken katsu: Like a mashup of American country fried steak smothered in gravy, but with chicken katsu and also partially German food? Huge portion, so share.",

Small dish for $42, but the amount of flavour in this dish forces you to forgive that.  A5 Wagyu potatoes - This dish was bigger and heartier. I loved the double fried potatoes mixed with the crispy garlic and grainy mustard. The Wagyu beef was not quite what I expected. They were thinly shaved pieces of Wagyu beef sprinkled over the potatoes.  Pork belly - I could eat a few of these in one sitting if I let myself. Everything from the thick juicy slice of pork belly to the pillowy soft bun was perfect.  Chilled spicy noodles - The cool temperature of the noodles combined with the heat of the peppers makes for a party in your mouth. It's a combo of distinct flavours and textures - sichuan sausage, Thai basil, and candied cashews - that magically work together.  Shoyu pork ramen (available in the afternoon) - This is a winning bowl of ramen. I respect ramen that has a good proportion of meat, greens, and noodles. Not only is there a thick slab of their infamous pork belly, they give you shredded pork shoulder, as well. The noodles are perfectly chewy, and soak up the tasty broth as it should.  Worth it.",

    "text": "This was an amazing experience. The cosmopolitan is one of the newest casinos on the strip with a hip-haut couture vibe and Momofuku serves Ramen bowls one of the newest trends to hit the foodie scene. What could a Vegas trip need after these two experiences?? First let me say, We love love love truffles and what better way to indulge than in ramen? I'm including photos of black truffle ramen bowl. Super yumm! The heat of the broth dissolved the truffle like butter! It was divine! Every earthy umami thought you have ever had made into a dish, We also had truffles over our wagu beef carpaccio ( it was sliced so thin you could read a paper through it! ) and to finish the meal---yep even truffled icecream! OMG! Did I say Yum! A friend had the unagi which I've included a photo of but neigh I wouldn't mess up my truffles fantasy with that.",

    "text": "Our reservation was at 930 pm here on NYE and we couldn't have been happier with Momofuku! Actually that's a lie, I'll get out my only complaints about this restaurant from the start: the place is incredibly loud! I'm not just talking about people, but the music they play is crazy loud too, or at least it was on NYE. So not the most romantic dinner location if that's what you're after. Second complaint: we didn't know who our server was for about 15 minutes because no one stopped at our table for that long. We were expecting top-notch service and we were starting to get a bit grumpy when our waiter finally arrived. And guess what? He was awesome (you know, once he arrived)! So overall we had great food and great service though the entrees here are a bit on the expensive side, I will admit. Everything else though seemed reasonable to us.  They do charge for water but it's only $1 for still and $2 for sparkling water! So not a big deal at all and I feel like many restaurants charge way more than that for sparkling so I cannot complain (fyi the water charge is NOT by the bottle, it's a flat charge). For appetizer we had the spicy cucumbers, for salad we had the honeycrisp apple salad, for entree we shared wagyu beef (on the day we had it the MP was $48 per ounce. Ouch. That hurt. But since Japan ruined my experience of beef forever already, and because we really weren't too hungry, we thought sharing a small amount of wagyu would be plenty and we have no regrets!), and even though we were full already we got 2 desserts to share after noticing they're from the NYC milk bar!  The spicy cucumbers were absolutely delicious! It's a simple dish with a lot of flavor, relatively large portion size for an appetizer, and only $9 so I'd highly recommend it as long as you're OK with spicy. The honeycrisp apple salad was also delicious, the apples were perfect and the labne cheese went perfectly with all the ingredients, but the apple slices were just way too big. We asked for a knife to be able to cut ours into bite sized pieces and I'd recommend that the restaurant considers doing this in the future. While the presentation looks more impressive with larger slices, it's not practical at all when it comes to eating the thing with chopsticks.   A5 Wagyu... It's insanely expensive, but it's worth it if you've never tried it or if you miss it. The downside is that you don't really see the cut that you are getting because it's already precut into bite size pieces and comes on a sizzling hot plate. At first I was disappointed to see the wagyu was rare, but then we realized why they did that and appreciated it a lot. You're supposed to use the hot plate the beef is sitting on to cook it! This way you can cook it perfectly and it is still hot when you're eating it. The one downside to perfectly cooked wagyu is it gets cold as you eat it, so this strategy eliminates that issue! So if you're wondering why your dish arrived completely rare, that's why! The wagyu plate also had peppers and a few other items on it that were all delicious. Was it as good as what we had in Japan? No. But it was heck of a lot better than just regular beef, so it was totally worth it.  For dessert we had the crack pie and birthday cake. Both from the milk bar (fyi Netflix chefs table desserts episodes, they have one about the chef that owns the milk bar where they talk about both of these desserts!) The crack pie is just butter in essence, it's delicious, and I'd recommend you get it a la mode if you're getting it. I really enjoyed the birthday cake but my husband thought it was too dry (I disagree). One thing we agreed on though is the slice is way too big for one person, we couldn't finish it between the two of us.  Overall would highly recommend Momofuku. The tables around us who had gotten family sized dishes or regular entrees all seemed very happy and the reviews on Yelp are mostly super positive as well! So give it a try unless you're looking for a quiet romantic dinner spot. It's too loud in there for that!",

I've had other chef's choice tasting menu in San Francisco for $450 per person but it did not wow me as Momofuku had.  Our dishes included a spicy cucumber dish.  It reminded me of the Chinese Cucumber cold dish mixed with sesame and chili oil.  We also had some sort of roasted green chili.  Oyster with Cavier (supposedly MP of $2k). Serrano Jason with big flakes of black truffle.  Salt and pepper lobster, shrimp, and veggies.  Roast duck with crepe or lettuce wraps, fried duck bones, steak, and some veggies.  And some very tasty sake was included.  I don't remember all the food that came last night but I do being wowed with the ones I've listed.  Oh and don't bother checking the menu.  You will not find any of these items on the menu.",

Come here for the so you can say you've experienced dining at a David Chang establishment and thr convenience of not having to leave the Cosmo hotel but be prepared to pay for the convenience and for the sub stellar food. Would i return back? Highly doubt it, really dont see anything special here. Maybe we had just ordered some of the lackluster dishes... but then again majority of our dishes was recommended by our waiter.. so yup.  Insider tip, you can order ramen but you need to ask for that menu because they will not be given to your automatically when they seat you.",

    "text": "Fun fact: David Chang is one of my chef crushes. He's always smiling or laughing on camera, he absolutely loves what he does, and he's not pretentious about it.   I first heard about Momofuku on No Reservations (Anthony Bordain is another chef crush), and I made a mental note to visit one of the locations some day. My first opportunity to do this was last summer during my Vegas trip.  First and foremost, you know something will be spectacular if it's housed in the Cosmopolitan. Momofuku's location makes it a hot spot for atypical visitors, so when you're not looking at the gorgeous view of the strip (pictured), you can sneak some peaks of the quirky people around you. Don't like those loud cowboys lookin' for a big juicy burger and letting everyone around them know? You probably won't find any of those here.  We had a reservation, so I'm not sure what the typical wait time is. The restaurant was packed, though.   After being seated, my eyes shot to the drink menu. Almost immediately they land on the spiced slush drink. When in Vegas, gotta try something different! It tasted like a spicy frozen margarita, for those who like those.  We started off with the crab stuffed deviled eggs, because why the heck wouldn't I try David Chang's seafood deviled eggs? Those are three of my favorite things! They were definitely the strangest deviled eggs I've ever had, and also pretty darn tasty.   We also ordered the ahi tuna with tomatoes and cheese, because this was a night of fusion food! I'm also always craving poke, so it was bound to be ordered. I'm not sure if it was actually listed as a fusion poke, but pretending that it was, this was also the strangest form of the dish I've ever had. I would have never thought to pair raw fish with tomatoes and cheese, but it was oddly delicious. Sometimes I wonder if David Chang thinks of dishes while he's really high...maybe that's what most chefs do though?  We ended with the smoked pork chops. Though well cooked and seasoned, this item was easily forgettable, compared to the other items we ordered. I'd say order it only if you want something safe.  Would I visit Momofuku again? Hell yes, and you should, too.",

    "text": "First of all, let me start by saying the customer service is great and this rating is purely from the food.  Everything on this menu was overpriced for buffet quality nonsense.  The only delicious item on there were the pork belly buns, which are slightly expensive and can be found in a lot of other restaurants.  The wagyu short rib kimchi stew was not tasty, got overpowered by the perilla leaf flavor and going the \"modern\" route on a classic Korean dish ruined everything (trust me I know this... Now I sound like the owner David Chang).  The sichuan beef noodles actually had well cooked noodles that were slightly al dente but the flavor was a miss that felt like a cross between chef boyardee and cheap Chinese noodles with pepper flavor.  Oysters were oysters and overpriced (this is the theme btw).  Shishito were not truly shishito peppers and 50% were spicy.  The flavor used were for these peppers weren't bad though.  Lamb... was gamey... pretty sure they don't know how to make it.  Between the seven of us and the bill coming out to approximately $100/person, it's NEVER worth it.  Nothing authentic about anything and they need to change before we ever come back.",

I gave this place a 5 star because not only the food was great, but the service was respectful, fun, and most importantly fast.  The pork belly was amazing and was juicy.  However, the ramen wasn't spectacular or different, but that didn't damper the experience.  For a quality place, the price was a little on the higher end.  The bread that was provided with the Pork Belly was very tasty and fluffy as well.  Don't worry about finishing the bread quick, they will provide more.  The corn was a letdown, nothing really special about that.  I'd say the spicy cucumbers were actually surprising the most.  I'm not a fan of cucumbers in general, but these gave a nice fresh crunch to start the meal.    P.S.  I think my time there was also cooler, the fact I saw Seth Rogen eating with his wife there too.",

The interior is nice and modern and they have a well stock bar with lots of Japanese whiskey. We ordered the following:   - Spicy cucumbers - very refreshing,  the togarashi over the nuts gave it a different taste - shishito peppers - did not have the grilled marks,  but was served with smoked salt - tasted pretty good - 5 spice rotessiere duck - a definite stand out and super flavorful (also was the longest dish we had to wait for)  - slow roasted pork shoulder - the meat literally falls apart when you use your utensil to grab it; goes well with the kimchi and lettuce - shoyu pork ramen - it came out kind of lukewarm and seemed to have a lot of things in it. I was not too impressed with it.  Overall,  a cool place to check out. It can be a bit pricey for what you get,  but then again - it's in the Cosmo in Vegas.",

Although the ramen was stunning and aesthetically beautiful. It needed some kick in my opinion to change up the taste. But this has to do a lot of ramen places. Nothing to really balance the heaviness with something different, like something vinegary or spicy.  Seriously, that pork belly was sooo amazinnggg.

I came here with 10 people. Two people in our group ate their own meals and the rest of us ate everything family style.  For those of who ate family style we ordered the following:  Starters: Pork belly buns Shrimp buns Shishito Peppers Horizon Rice Cakes  Mains: Rack of Beef Short Rib 5 Spice Rotisserie Duck   Everything was amazing! I preferred the shrimp buns over the pork belly buns so if you limit yourself to one - I'd recommend the shrimp. Don't be intimidated by the shishito peppers - only 1 in 20 is spicy. We ate the whole bowl and none of ours were spicy! Very delicious, especially if you did then in the hot sauce they bring out (the hot sauce isn't that hot).  The Rice Cakes were simply amazing - I'd compare these to gnocchi, sooo good! I love that they were crispy.   The beef short rib and 5 spice duck were phenomenal. The presentation is really impressive too. The waitstaff bring the whole duck out, cut it in front of you, and then deep fry the bones and bring those back to the table! Please do yourself a favor and get them both!   As a bonus - stop next door to Milk Bar and pick yourself up a piece of crack pie! Amazing.   And if you don't know the history behind this restaurant or the one next door (Milk Bar), I'd recommend watching the episode of chef's table about Christina Tosi (on Netflix)!",

Even though it's not on the dinner menu, we were stil able to order it!   It's definitely pricier than your typical ramen bowl elsewhere, but no lie, it  was amazing!!! The pork belly was fatty and juicy, and the broth was so flavorful.   It is definitely one of my favorite ramen places which I did not expect for Las Vegas.",

Both the bf and his sister are fans of David Chang and to our surprise, we were actually able to see him that night while dining there. Apparently there was a Yelp Elite Event that I had NO IDEA about or else I would have signed up!! Seeing David Chang totally made their night, even if was just for a second before the servers closed up the blinds and obstructed their view haha.    We had made reservations for dinner, without knowing that their hours were updated to include lunch as well. Too bad...Momofuku had some pretty interesting stuff on the lunch menu, but we were impressed by dinner nonetheless. Their menu is updated DAILY - which is crazy to me. We ordered a variety of things and decided to do family style and share so we could try out a little of everything.     PORK BELLY BUNS (2 per order) $14 - hoisin, scallion, cucumber. These were kind of pricey at $7 each for a tiny bun, but we wanted to get them cause of the popularity. I've had better buns and they were nothing special. It was alright for an appetizer. If I were to return - would definitely pass on it.   MOMOFUKU OYSTERS $28 - broiled with kimchi, spinach, bacon. MY FAVORITE OF THE NIGHT. 10 total oysters and I probably ate more than half myself. They were SOOOO good. Just the right amount of spicy and crunchy from the kimchi and bacon. I secretly wanted to have the whole plate of oysters to myself. Add in a bowl of rice to make a complete meal and I would have been in heaven.    SPICY SICHUAN RICE CAKES $21 - pork sausage, broccoli, crispy onions. At first, I was really excited to try them because I usually like spicy food. However... took one bite and my mouth/tongue felt like it was on fire and burning. I was disappointed that I wasn't able to fully enjoy the rice cakes, but my other 2 tablemates loved this dish very much. Glad that they were able to handle the spicyness and finish the plate themselves! This was my least favorite...due to my weak taste buds and/or the strong Sichuan sauce.  SWEET & SOUR LONG BEANS $8. Just like the name itself, this dish was super simple but to our surprise, it was delicious. We needed some type of veggie dish with our dinner to make it seem like it we were eating somewhat healthy lol. The long beans did not taste at all that bad like green vegetables usually do. In fact, whatever sweet & sour sauce they coated the beans in had such great flavor that it made me forget I was even eating beans. SECOND FAVORITE of the night.   STEAMED RICE $4. I'm Chinese and we need rice with every meal daily, so you know I had to order a bowl.   CRACK PIE $6.50 - oat crust with a gooey butter filling. We were planning to go to Milk Bar afterwards, but decided to just get dessert at Momofuku. Everyone raved about the crack pie, so obviously we had to get it. It's a small slice that's packed with ooey, gooey goodness. I loved the toasted crust and the filling inside was amazing.     Knowing that it's Vegas, you're kind of expected to pay a premium for everything. Momofuku had some hit and misses with the food for me... but overall, I did enjoy everything. I also liked the service and ambiance of the restaurant. Side note, I went into the women's restrooms and they have heated toilets!! It amazed me so much that I spent some time in there trying it out lol... anyway I did have a wonderful time with good company and now I can say that I was able to dine at a David Chang restaurant.",

This place is located in the lovely cosmopolitan across from our hotel planet Hollywood! We didn't make reservations so when we first got there they estimated the wait to be 45mins to one hour but we got seated after 15 minutes. We both ordered pork ramen and I had asked our server if they have edamame which they didn't BUT they had peppers he recommended and boy I'm glad he did because they were AMAZING. Nothing I've ever had.. just delicious. The ramen portion was HUGE we honestly could've just shared one. We really enjoyed momofuku and will recommend it to others!",

Our waiter was super attentive and knew we were celebrating 2 brides to be, he gave us each a little white wine to taste and toast!  We tried the diver scallops, that was a little disappointing as it was quite small. The wild king salmon and pork chop was tasty! But out of all the dishes the best was 5 Spice Rotisserie Duck for $218, it says it serves 2-4. It comes with bib lettuce and chive pancakes and sauces for you to wrap the duck in. Very similar to Peking duck. They bring out the whole duck and crave in pieces in front of you, then take the bone and deep fry and bring it back for you to munch on. Very tasty and memorable experience, will def be coming back!",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I went to Las Vegas as a small trip for our second-year anniversary, and this was definitely on our list of places to try.  We were seated very quickly (tip: make a reservation if you want to get right in when you arrive) and were extremely pleased with the polite and helpful server.  We received a complimentary glass of pink champagne because it was our anniversary, and then we ordered cocktails.  The drinks were small, especially for the price, but I will admit that they were especially tasty. Super delicious. We knew we wanted to try the pork buns and some ramen, so we picked the more expensive dishes from the ramen selection, which were the Black Truffle Ramen and the Toasted Noodles. First off, the pork buns are SO soft and practically melt in your mouth. At $7 each, they're definitely worth the price. The black Truffle ramen was extremely tasty. I'll be dreaming about that ramen for years to come. It's more expensive at $48 compared to the normal ramen priced at $16, but worth it if you're coming here for a special occasion. The toasted noodles were excellent, but not what my boyfriend was expecting. I think he wanted a more traditional ramen bowl, but the toasted noodles are actually a dish served on a huge plate filled with clams, shrimp, oregano and chili's. He said it was good, but he would rather get the $16 plate of noodles if he came back. We also had a side of crispy potatoes made with truffle creme, and OH MY GOD. Seriously one of the best parts of the meal. I wanted to snatch-up the bowl and keep it to myself.  Our bill ended-up being $200, but then again, we did order the most expensive noodle dishes, cocktails, sides and appetizers. This is definitely doable if you're on a fancy date for a special occasion, otherwise you should still come and try their pork buns and potatoes.  Thanks Momofuku!",

The best service we've gotten our entire trip at a restaurant. He picked our drinks PERFECTLY on the money and was incredibly knowledgeable and kept it real with us (didn't let us over order which is so awesome). We did the family style pork shoulder dish, shashito peppers, the pork belly buns, the ramen, the snapper, and the jalapeno. AND I ONLY HAVE ONE QUESTION. WHY IS THERE NONE IN MIAMI, FL, USA, EARTH?!?!?!?! I mean wow!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! How can it possibly be so delicious? I'm not just saying this, I really really LOVED this place. We all did. We NEED ONE IN MIAMI, MISTER CHANG. PLEASE. Thanks,",

Since we were celebrating, the hubby and I decided to splurge a bit. I started with a cosmo slushie, which was very refreshing and good, and he started with a beer. We first ordered the scallop poke and it was incredible - great way to start the meal. We then ordered shrimp, chicken and pork buns (pork belly was the clear winner here), spicy sichuan rice cakes, black winter truffle ramen and wagyu medallions. Honestly, everything was incredible but the pork buns, wagyu medallions and scallop poke were probably my favs!   The prices here are a bit steep but that's what you expect with exceptional David Chang food + Vegas. Don't forget to get dessert - you can either go to Milk bar next door or order from the table! Crack pie is amazing!!! Can't wait to return on our next trip to Vegas.",

If I could I would've tried many more things!  Of course, I got the pork ramen, the broth is on the sweeter side, which isn't ideal for me, but all the other components were delicious. My husband ordered the cold noodles and it looked really good. If I could have handled spicy I would've tasted it.  We asked the waitress for her recommendations because we were debating between some of the baos. We went for the cod bao first, but honestly, it's a glorified fillet o fish. Not saying it was horrible, but it wasn't anything special (hence the -.5) The pork belly bao though...I mean can there be a bad pork belly bao?? It was so good. I wish we got two of those instead.   They serve dessert, but it's only things from next door (Milk).  P.S. the bathrooms are only single person, but they do have the fancy Japanese bidets.",

    "text": "This was a tough review for me. I've enjoyed David Chang's NYC restaurants, and while I'm certainly not a fan of everything he does (I've always found his ramen subpar, for example), part of me feels like we should feel lucky to have a branch in Vegas since at least we'll have access to some of his quality dishes. At the same time, there are a lot of negatives about the Momofuku here.  First off, they only offer a super-limited menu at lunch. The Momofuku in Vegas is already just a mish-mash of his NYC restaurants so already missing a lot of things, and the lunch menu just pares it down too much. I get that due to volume there are just going to be some dishes that aren't feasible (like the large formats), but even many smaller seafood dishes (scallops, salmon) aren't available at lunch, and those are some of my favorites.  At least the bao (go for the pork and shrimp - not a fan of the mushroom) and the foie gras bigeye tuna dish (must-order, even for $38) are available at lunch, but I just feel like if you're going to be open for lunch you should go all the way.  As I mentioned before, I've never been a fan of Momofuku ramen - it's certainly never been among NYC's best and even in Vegas there are off-Strip places that, even if they're different in style, are just simply better than what Momofuku offers. If you really want to do ramen here, I'd suggest the \"hozon\" chickpea vegetarian ramen just to have something different. I have only had it at the NYC Noodle Bar and not here in Vegas, but it was by far the best ramen I've tried from Momofuku.  Service has not been good on my visits, either. I've had servers that were just plain disinterested, and even when the servers were friendly enough, they just didn't seem to pay much attention. They really need to be more polished here, especially for the price they're asking for the food.  Ultimately, if you've never been to Momofuku and really want to try, this place is OK - but I'd avoid lunch. And if you're going to be in NYC anytime soon (or possibly DC), I think it's better off visiting his locations there.",

Even though they're $7 each, it is so worth it to have one...or two. The pork ramen was delicious as well. The broth had this great smoky flavor to it that I really enjoyed.  The only thing I would have liked was for the broth to be a bit more temperature hot. I added on some bok choy that might have brought the temperature down a bit, but the soup starting out a bit hotter would make it all that much more tasty in my opinion.  All in all, wonderful experience. Can't wait to go back!",

The hubby and I shared a drink (Toki Thyme), some buns (unagi bun and shiitake bun), and shishito peppers.  Everything was delicious and flavorful.  Of the buns, the shiitake was my favorite (but I so love mushrooms).  That being said, the unagi was still very good.  The shishito's were some of the best I have ever had (hard to say if it was the smoked salt or the lime that hit the mark).  For my meal, I decided to go with the Chilled and Spicy.  The spicy sausage and candied cashews were an excellent contrast of flavors (who doesn't like sweet and spicy?).  I'm sure this will be on our list of places to go when we need bite.  The menu has a lot of interesting food that I would love to try.",

    "text": "Momofuku operates next to sister restaurant Milk Bar in the Cosmopolitan, and across from Eggslut, completing a triangle of restaurants where you can get \"edgy\" urban fare in the middle of the Las Vegas strip. Yep, I can only slightly mask my contempt for the on-going hipsterfication of food. As talented as David Chang is, I hold him accountable as one of the primary architects of this more casual post-gourmet trend in high-end dining that I disdain.  Nonetheless, I do usually enjoy my trips to the man's restaurants despite their annoyingly pared-down chic aesthetic, hip hop soundtracks, and PoMo art installations, and I've been looking forward to visiting his Vegas outpost since it opened. Casual high-end dining only works if the food is incredible. If you're not the very best at the type of food you prepare in your city, yet you are going to charge me high-end fine dining prices, I better see Schweitzer white table cloths. Fortunately, this has never been a concern of mine with the Momofuku group of restaurants, even if they're making everyone else lazy.  Interestingly, the diner next to me at the chef's bar asked his waiter what Momofuku was all about and was told, \"Japanese street food.\" As someone who has spent a good amount of time in Japan, I shuddered at that response. Culturally, I'm not sure \"street food\" works conceptually for the Japanese, who have historically valued ritual and formality during dining. Also, let's be clear: no one is ever going to mistake Tokyo for Tijuana. No, I'd say Momofuku is an izakaya experience if we're going to call it Japanese, or a Korean/Japanese/American fusion restaurant if we're not. I know fusion is a dirty word in culinary circles due to the failures of all of the Nobu knock-offs over the past few decades, but let's stop using the term \"street food\" to describe our yankophillic interpretations of low-brow food from other cultures. It's not only confusing, but it comes across as try-hard and even a tad racist.  The food at Momofuku Las Vegas was predictably great.  I started with the Spicy Cucumbers ($7), essentially a bowl of cucumber chunks dusted with togarashi (Japanese chili pepper powder), crushed toasted almond, and scallions. If you're expecting pickles, this is not that -- it really is just cucumbers. This is a simple starter dish that effectively delivers the restaurant's point of view: a) we're going to screw with your expectations, b) yet deliver something real good, and c) you're going to pay good $$$ for it.  For my entree, I ordered the Pork Ramen ($18). This was not the first time I've had Momofuku's famous pork broth, which is built on powdered mushrooms, chicken bones, kombu, rendered bacon fat, and a tare infused with bacon ends. Similar to what I've had at other locations, the broth here is darker, sweeter, and thinner than the tonkotsu broths that are currently favored in west coast ramen-yas. What really sets apart Momofuku's pork ramen, however, is the pork itself. The browning reaction on the pork stands up to the broth, and is probably the most important aspect of making this dish delicious. Supporting the belly by adding more substance to the bowl, the pork shoulder is prepared in a manner more similar to crispy carnitas than the dull, plain-o slices of \"chashu\" pork that end up in bowls of ramen elsewhere. The sous-vide'd soft-boiled egg can be stirred into the broth to add more substance, or just eaten straight away -- either way, it is a great addition to the bowl.  As good as the food was, I felt the service could have been better. My waiter did not seem too interested in talking about various menu options, and I felt I got very terse answers to my questions. Not like the place was at capacity either. When I pay $7 for raw cucumbers, I want to feel valued. I didn't feel enough love on this particular visit. Still, the positives outweighed the negatives and even with my inherent bias against what David Chang is doing to dining, I still can't stop going to his restaurants.  Food/Decor/Service: 4.5/3.9/3.7",

We were helped by Cezar or Caesar, he was really pleasant and would graciously pick up whatever my son would drop on the floor. Greg prepared our Duck order that comes with the Hainanese rice. He was great too. He walked us through everything he was doing. He fried the other parts of our duck and my goodness it was perfect. The pork belly buns, pork belly ramens, ginger ramen were all mouthwatering and perfectly done. Everything we ordered here became our instant favorites but the great service by Cezar and Greg made it even better. We always go to Wicked Spoon everytime we are in Vegas now we are adding Momofuku in our Vegas must be visited food places. Anything with Pork Belly here is delicious! Perfectly made Asian Food, Dear Dave Chang, your restaurant did not disappoint! Pls continue to make great food.",

Our party started with the spicy cucumbers with almonds; wasn't really spicy at all but the sauce and seasoning were tasty. For our main course we ordered the ginger noodles, shoyu pork ramen, 5 spice rotisserie duck and slow roasted pork shoulder. Both noodle dishes were really good and the pork shoulder was absolutely amazing. The marinade made it rich in flavor and the meat melted in your mouth. The duck was also solid but nothing memorable. Just like the rest of the Cosmo, the decor is well done and the wait staff was great. The portions were also great, all those dishes fed 5 adults and one toddlers, leaving us all satisfied. Overall a very solid choice of you're looking for some fine pan-Asian dining",

The depth of flavor was amazing.  My son in law had the pork belly ramen which was a religious experience for him.  I did not hear a peep out of him for about 15 minutes.  I had the Ginger Scallion noodles and I enjoyed them very much, the patty pan squash was delicious with a rich curry that was yummy.  The price was a little high for lunch, we got out of there for 240.00 with no alcoholic drinks.  I will come back for a special occasion with someone from out of town or the like but it wont be on my regular list.",

The ginger scallion noodles seem like it's missing something. It's a bit plain and tasted better cold instead.",

    "text": "Was there this past weekend for dinner. I think the restaurant is a bit over hyped. I went there with too high of an expectation. I felt like the taste of the food was just normal but they make the ambiance \"feel fancy\", but the price of the food didn't match with the quality and taste of the food. We had the $250 five spice duck (out the door was $300 for just one duck). Probably wouldn't be ordering that again as there's wayyyy much better tasting ducks elsewhere for $30-40. I think the cutting of the duck in front of the guests to put into the clay pot took way too long. By the time they finished cutting it and serve it, the rice and duck was cold already and made the rice too oily and it was cold (not pleasant tasting at all). They also charge $1 per person for regular tap water, which is ridiculous as water should be a basic human need and should not be charged. We realized afterwards that they charged $1 for both tab water and sparkling water. Charging for sparkling water makes sense but not for tab water (I'm actually a bit angry regarding that fact).  The waiters did not inform us prior either.  Usually at some high end restaurants there would be even complimentary starters or desserts, but not only did they not provide that and they charged for water. The only good thing is they had a nice setting and good service. The duck that we got was not so good, especially for how much it cost for one item and didn't taste anything special. Just a bit disappointing. Even my friends that had been there before had gotten other dishes, but they were disappointed as well for the taste and cost of the food.",

Highly recommend the group set course meals to try everything (you give them a price range and they curate the rest).

Slow to take orders, slow to bring our drinks, never checked on us, and then took forever to get our checks. Chickpea ramen - too warm, too salty, too thick and oily broth, and not enough broth. Just a strange combination of the ingredients - chickpeas and ramen. Very overpriced considering the meal is nearly empty and have to pay extra for every ingredients to add - boc choy,egg, chicken. Pork ramen broth is little better but still came out lukewarm and barely any broth. Mussels - too simple, very weak flavor. Between extremely inattentive and slow service to flavorless dishes, this restaurant is a major disappointment considering the name",

    "text": "What an experience. Even before we stepped in, we had built up expectations due to the social media love and star chef appeal.   Before you walk in, you can see the attached milk bar - yummy desserts! From the outside seating section, it looks very typical and casual. However, the sections inside transport you to a fine, modern, Asian-inspired dining setting. Leather seats, contemporary lighting fixtures, awesome art on the wall!  Our party of 5 started off with 3 starters - the spicy cucumbers, crispy potatoes and market greens. The cucumbers were divine and super fresh, they reminded me of classic Korean bam han with a fusion twist. The potatoes were crunchy and the truffle topping was decadent. Market greens - not that memorable except for the use of interesting vegetables.  We then had the infamous pork buns, accompanied by the ssam sauce. The meat was so tender and juicy and the bread was perfect. Amazinggg.  The ginger scallion noodles were lightly seasoned and the accompanying vegetables were very complementary to the overall taste. The rigatoni was more adventurous in its taste but my mom loved it, fresh seafood balanced with hand rolled pasta and an acidic tasting sauce.  The rotisserie jidori chicken reminded me of Korean tong ddak or whole fried chicken. Squeezes of lime made the various spices rubbed onto the chicken skin pop. Meat was tender and not too dry not too juicy.  I usually detest lamb because of the smell but this dish - sichuan lamb ribs - was cooked well to get rid of that smell. There was some heat but well balanced with the yogurt sauce.  Lastly, the porterhouse prime rib. Cooked to medium rare perfection - meat was juicy and not annoying to chew on. The side fries were a little salty but the brussel sprouts were yummy - sauce reminded me of yuzu.  DESSERT from the famous milk bar. The crack pie a la mode was to die for. The soft serve it comes with is called cereal because the concoction rests with cereal to give it that particular sweetness. Pie is literally crack.  Birthday cake - soft and not too sweet. There were small bits of cake dough? dispersed to liven up the texture. The sprinkles are really cute to look at.  I'd come back but would order less // order my favorites like the pork bun, cucumbers and chicken, scallion noodles and prime rib.   Fun fact: momofuku means 'lucky peach' in Japanese. It also sounds like a curse word.",

We ordered the rack of beef short ribs, roasted brussel sprouts & cauliflower, small salad with 2 alcoholic drinks & 2 waters. Every dish ordered was tasty but incredibly salty, the beef short ribs had a lot of fat on them as well! All 4 of us agreed on that. The dinner was definitely not worth $400 +.

Note that they are fairly new here in the food scene but they have many locations and their NY one is very well known.   The service was lacking a bit during our visit. Our server seemed like he was no where to be seen most of the time. We also over heard the next table waiting on their check and how the server has been taking a long time. Maybe because it was Valentine's Day and they did not put enough people on. Our server was very friendly though and did try to check up on us when he had the chance.  For the food I thought it was delicious. Some wowed us more then other dishes but overall I would say it was not bad. My favorite dish was definitely the pork belly buns. I've had a lot of pork belly before but these were on a different level. I also loveeee their cereal milk ice cream. Omgosh that was to die for and I'm still mind blown by how they got that flavor. Their cucumber salad was very refreshing and delicious. We also tried the kimchi baked oysters which I thought was good but was missing something. The ramen wasn't our favorite, I've definitely had better ramen before. The rice cake was good and flavorful but we could have gone without it. Overall I thought the food was good but not everything had the wow factor that we were looking for.",

I don't eat pork so I was sooo worried that I wouldn't be able to eat anything from this place. Our reservation was at 10:30p. I was starving and had no other choice.   We ordered the ff:  Shrimp Bun - delish but $9 for 1 piece?!  Diver Scallops - fave dish but omit the bacon. it is perfect w/o bacon and the bf agreed.  Rotisserie Chicken & Fried Bone - they were able to have the ranch bacon on the side. Ginger Scallion Noodles - light & filling.  Chinese Broccoli - i love me some gai lan.   My bf and I shared everything---family style. The food was filling but weren't stuffed to the brim which was good because we have a long night ahead of us.   The service was okay.

    "text": "First let me start of by saying I'd been planning this meal with my boyfriend for a while after watching Ugly Delicious. We'd both carefully studied the menu and were prepped for our lunch. The layout of both the milk bar and momofuku are very inviting and vibrant. We were quickly shown to a table in the main dining room with no wait. I love the atmosphere of the restaurant our waiter was extremely helpful and even was able to cook a chicken sandwich dish on the later evening menu since my boyfriend had been dreaming about it. It just goes back to the laid back and accommodating atmosphere David Chang has created. We ordered the fried potato starters which were amazing! I had the vegetable noodle dish - Ginger Scallion Noodles pickled shiitake, cucumber, wakame and a soft boiled egg on top which was amazing! A must get for vegetarians! The Shrimp bun with spicy mayo, pickled red onion, and iceberg which my boyfriend loved. The special dish they did upon request was the Spicy Fried Chicken Sandwich smoked pepper sauce, cured cucumber which my boyfriend still raves about to this day. All of this was for a reasonable $50 in Las Vegas!! Momofuku is a must try during your trip to Las Vegas! David Chang has created the best experience, best food for the best price!",

    "text": "AMAZING!! Tonight was the first night my husband and I ate there, and we have already planned our next night out-there! Momofuku has a different menu than what I am used to, so I was nervous. But I was NOT disappointed at all! The food was phenomenal. With a mixture of flavors that I would have never even thought would mix well. A choice of noodles, meat, seafood and more! We tried a little bit of everything and can't decide which was our favorite. We narrowed it down to the pork belly buns with chili sauce and the chops.   Not only was their food delicious, the service could not have been better! We had a great waiter- Cooper, if he is available- ask for him! We also met with management, for no other reason than to check on us and make our experience that much better. Such a great place. From the Manager, to the server, to the food and dessert, everything was spot on.   20/10 recommend. Will be back soon.",

It's difficult to overstate how ridiculous the prices are. I ordered beef noodles and received a plate of spaghetti with ground beef. It was like hamburger helper with 5-spice. For $28. Even the presentation left a lot to be desired.   Service is just ok. They make a big deal about how everything is supposed to be family style. I think that's just a way to cover-up the fact that they can't time food delivery from the kitchen. We received our main dishes over the course of 10 mins.

    "text": "The wife and I had dinner at Momofuki early Friday evening for our final meal of our trip.  We didn't have reservations; however, they weren't necessary since we arrived at the restaurant before 6PM and the dining room and even the bar was largely empty that early in the evening's service.   As a result, we were seated immediately.  I started off with a cocktail, the Toki Thyme ($16) made with Suntory Toki Japanese whiskey, apricot, pink peppercorn, and garnished with a dehydrated orange wheel and thyme.  It was an aesthetically appealing, tasty, well-made drink.  For our food, the wife and I shared orders of the Shishito Peppers ($9), an Unagi (freshwater eel) Bun ($9), and a Shiitake Bun ($7).  All of our selections were delicious.  To my recollection, the shishito peppers were better this trip than they were on my previous visit to Las Vegas and Momofuki last March.  For my main, I had a bowl of the Truffle Ramen ($50).  Was it pricey and over-the-top?  Hell yeah!  However, it was a good-sized bowl of ramen and it was a serious umami-fest with a generous amount of grated black truffle.  All in all, while it may be on the pricey end of the spectrum for what you get, Momofuku delivered a solid all-around dining experience especially given its Strip location.  I found my food and drink very much to my liking.  It was a great way to end our Vegas vacation.",

The poached egg was a nice change to a soft boiled egg. The pork belly in both dishes were definitely the winners. It was lightly grilled so that it was crispy yet still really tender. You definitely can tell that they put extra effort in perfecting their meat so that it is flavorful and has the perfect texture.   + THE ENVIRONMENT Located in The Cosmo, Momofuku is easily accessible on The Strip. There is so much seating here, from the large tables in the front to the vast bar seating, to the main dining hall with a beautiful view of  Paris and The Strip. The wait is never long here and you can always make reservations via OpenTable.",

    "text": "Momofuku well exceeded my expectations...once I got past the Vegas-menu-prices-sticker shock. We came here for a nicer weekday dinner & made reservations via OpenTable. I was surprised how packed it was on  a Tuesday night, so plan accordingly!   Our server, Anna, was lovely - just the right amount of attentive without hovering and was really helpful.   First, the cocktails are SO FUN! I ordered the Heart of Te Fiti (mezcal, chartreuse, citrus, almond, cardamom). For mezcal lovers, this is for you! And, I love how inspired (Moana) the cocktail was. This needs to be at Disney - stat! My boyfriend ordered the Draft Negroni (gin, campari, sweet vermouth, orange oil). I loved the orange on the nose as you drank this cocktail. Both cocktails were stiff.   As for the good stuff, we had the:  *Bigeye Tuna (shaved foie gras, strawberry): The strawberry was just BEAUTIFUL on this. The touch of sweetness was perfect with the oily tuna, rich foie gras. This is not a combination I've had anywhere else.   *Pear & Burrata (hazelnut, young lettuce, black truffle) - I can never resist burrata, so I had to try this. While not listed, the main flavor of this is the pesto. I was surprised at how much I enjoyed the combination. BUT this isn't a must try like the other dishes.   *Pork Belly + Shrimp Buns - When you're at Momofuku, you have to get the buns right? The Pork Belly is fine. It's good but so many places have pork buns like these that I think it's become a commodity. However, the shrimp bun was spectacular. It reminded me of a spicy honey walnut shrimp...but in bun form of course. Damn I could have had just the shrimp buns for dinner & have been satisfied.   *Steamed Whole Branzino (charred lemon, brown butter dashi, herbs) - This was a beautiful fish. I'm used to fish being served head to tail like this, but Anna kindly offered to remove it for us. Some reviews said that this was too acidic, but I thought it was perfect with the savoriness of the butter + dashi. I could DRINK the seasoning on this & the branzino was the perfect vehicle. This was a lot of food & I felt like it was worth the $68.   For dessert, we had the crack pie a la mode. It's exactly what it sounds like ...crack pie with cereal milk soft serve. In full transparency, I don't like either of these separately but they're a match made in heaven together. The savoriness of the cereal milk soft serve balances out the sweet butter filling of the crack pie. Yum.  Also, you have to stop by the loo for a serious Japanese toilet!   76/365",

Since we couldn't order dinner since we got their around 4:00ish thinking we would beat the dinner crowd we were opted to the limited menu which had noodle dishes and small bites. We ended getting the pork belly buns they come in two's since there were four of us we got one each (two orders). They were good but just not enough to satisfy our early hunger. We after that we left. The staff was nice and service was pretty fast but we just wished we had a dinner menu.

In general, items on the menu are expensive (dinner entrees range from $30-60+).   If you haven't tried their pork belly bao and like pork belly, it is worth a try. It is a pretty big bao but is a bit expensive at $7. The pork belly is a thick long slab of tender fatty meat, and the combination with hoisin sauce is really delicious.  Their pork belly ramen ($18) is only available with shoyu broth, which is okay but didn't stand out (I was disappointed that tonkatsu broth was not available). They do include a very soft boiled egg which is nice.  Overall the food was pretty good (probably the best pork belly I've had in ramen), but not good enough to justify the price.",

    "text": "After a 7 hour drive to experience David Chang's restaurant, I'd say it was worth the drive. Honestly I was expecting a bit of a pretentious ambiance, but I was wrong. The place had a great vibe, with floor to ceiling glass to get a glimpse of Vegas.   The cocktails - my suggestion is to stop playing penny slots awaiting your free drink on the casino floor, and spend the $16 for the cocktails! They were delicious! When I don't know the ingredients on the menu, sometimes I think that means it must be exotic and delicious. But in this case, they were so different and tasty! We got a spiced apple milk punch   The food: the pork belly bun was probably top 2 I've ever had. Okay make that the best I've ever had! Not only was the pork belly melt in your mouth, but the bun tasted so incredibly authentic and freshly made. The toasted noodles were also a slam dunk - slightly spicy, the sauce tasted simple but done right, and with the tiger prawns and clams it hit all the notes I was expecting. The oysters were delicious, fresh, and accompanied by a mignonette that I had no complaints on any of the food!  4 stars was for the lack of knowledge from the service side. Given this was our first time, and that the menu was created by the infamous David Chang, I wanted to know exactly what I'm eating as the price tag was a hefty one! Questions like \"are your noodles made in house, are the portion sizes that different, what's the reason for your noodle dishes variation of $15-$48\" seemed pretty simple to me but the response was that they didn't know. Nothing against the server, more something for management to train your people!   Overall I'd come back, and know that you'll be throwing down more than a couple Benjamin's but it's SO worth it!",

I ordered the pork buns and I have had better and cheaper pork buns locally in the Bay Area. There were one or two drops of sauce, the bun was starting to get dry at the corners and the meat just didn't taste freshly braised. We got the ginger scallion noodle and there was an overpowering amount of salt and not enough acid or ginger to counteract the salt flavor. The whole chicken was well cooked, but again there was one predominant flavor of salt. The kimchi was good though.  For Momofuku, I was expecting more - perhaps more depth, more substance. I still love you David Chang and I'm willing to give it another shot.",

    "text": "Shared a late night dinner at Momofuku a couple Saturdays ago. I was so excited to finally try them since I've missed them on my last couple of visits to NYC. Milkbars Birthday Cake has been my all time favorite cake for YEARS so it was really time for me to get my Ramen on. I always feel that restaurants that open in Vegas never taste the same or as good as their originals in other cities but since I've never had Momofuku I felt I couldn't be too disappointed since I have nothing to compare this location to.  Service was great! My mojito slushee was rum yummy! I enjoyed my pork belly bun, shishito peppers and ramen. All very tasty! Tried a bite of the meatballs my boyfriend ordered and these were good too. I ordered everything from the menu that our server had NOT recommenced which can be scary at times but I did it with zero apprehension and was satisfied with all of it.   I ordered a slice of Birthday Cake from Milkbar to go, and this was definitely a bit different. I ate it for brekke the next morning but it was dry and just totally different. I was disappointed with it and would say skip unless you've confirmed you aren't getting a dry weird slice.  I'd surely return to Momofuku again and now I'm even more excited to try them in NY.  Enjoyed the vibe, staff, energy, decor and music here. Highly recommend you dine here if staying nearby, easy to book a rezzie via OpenTable.",

    "text": "Not my type of ramen. Friends and I were interested in this restaurant because it was ramen in Las Vegas strip and from watching \"Mind of a Chef\" show.  After making the reservation, there was still a short wait for our table of 10. After getting seats, our waiter was awesome and got us water orders in but then things went from great to not so good.  We hung out, chatted, chilled and our orders of pork belly bun came 20 minutes later.  It was tasty and really simple. The pork fatty was a big portion of the slice so if you are afraid of eating fat, don't get it.  After finishing that, we continue to wait.  Another 25 minutes passed, one ramen came.  The friend that got the ramen started eating and everyone was still waiting.  Then another ramen came 5 minutes later, another ramen came. 2 minutes after, most of our ramen came except for one of my friend's.  The last bowl of ramen came after we asked the waiter to check up on it.  It was poorly timed as the first person got the ramen finished his in 10 minutes and the last person was still waiting. Food: the bun was great and when I got my Pork Ramen, it turns out to be the same pork piece in the bun is the same in my ramen.  The taste was a interesting and not your typical ramen flavor.  Some people may like it, but it wasn't my liking. Service other than waiting for our food was attentive. He constantly came by and refilled our water, touched up the table. Sorry not a fan.",

Everything we had was amazing but the best item there was the chef's special truffle ramen ($38). It was pricey but my boyfriend and I agree it's the best one we had ever! It stopped our ramen cravings for awhile and definitely raised our bar for ramen. Would love to come back and try other items on the menu, especially any chef's special :)",

Dark woods, metallic accents, and a large graffiti piece anchor the large interior's modern look.   The a la carte menu lists small plates, raw bar, buns, salads, meat & seafood, rice & noodles, sides, and desserts. I drank sake, but my friend ordered the Jade Dragon (pisco, jalapeno, and melon) which I loved and kept stealing. Just know it's caliente...and I'm not referring to the temperature of the drink.   What I tried:  Shishito Peppers Spicy Cucumbers Pork Belly Bun Shiitake Buns Chicken Karaage Kimchi Rice Bowl Chilled Spicy Noodles  Except for perhaps the Shiitake Bun, we loved everything else. The highlight being the Kimchi Rice Bowl. Know that everything comes out as ready, so you are really in charge of coursing your meal. Didn't try dessert this time; we chose to share a Crack Pie at MILK next door instead. I would not go out of my way to visit for dinner (as I would NYC's KO) but would 100% return for lunch again.

    "text": "5/100 Yelp 2018 Review Challenge  WAU. Boyfriend surprised me for my birthday with a night at the Cosmo and dinner at Momofuku and it was quite a delicious surprise.  To start off we ordered some drinks - I got the Come Chai With Me (vodka, fig, blood orange, chai) which was pretty good. Had a smoky after taste. My boyfriend got the Toki Thyme. WOW. Now one of my all thyme (ha) favorite cocktails I've ordered. Later on, our waiter surprised us with a drink recommendation - the Penicillin (scotch, lemon, honey, ginger) which was so refreshing.  For food we shared: 1) HAMACHI (5/5) Ugh, this was so good. Hamachi with a ponzu sauce, blood orange and uni. I don't really like uni, but it really rounded out the citrusy/sweet flavor of the dish.  2) PORK BELLY BUNS (5/5) and UNAGI BUNS (3/5) I didn't expect the pork belly to be so THICK which was a pleasant surprise. It was crispy on the outside but still that juicy tenderness. Add the \"ssam sauce\" for a little kick. The unagi buns were unfortunately less tasty and under seasoned. It was pretty bland to me.  3) CHILLED SPICY NOODLES (5/5) Easily one of my favorite dishes of the night. It's basically chilled ramen noodles topped by a spicy sauce (chili oil I think?), peppers, and ground pork. The whole dish was just packed with flavor.  4) STEAMED WHITE BRANZINO (4/5) Our waiter recommended this to us and he made it sound so delicious. It was pretty good and I liked that it was deboned. The fish itself was very flavorful and I really liked all the sauce and herbs. But the more I ate it the more it tasted like I was eating mozzarella and pesto and less like fish. It was a taste that I got tired of with each bite so I had a hard time eating a lot of this. The waiter said it would be good for two people but my boyfriend and I struggled to finish this (also probably because we enjoyed the previous dishes and drinks a bit much).  Overall, a solid dining experience - 4.5 stars. I was impressed but wasn't really wow-d and don't feel particularly compelled to come back. But the service and drinks were great I definitely would like to try Momofuku in New York or any other of David Chang's restaurants for that matter just for the experience.",

I thought the vegas location was going to be a family style experience like NY.  Momofuko is located on the 3rd floor of the Cosmo.   Parking is free for 1 hour.  Services was over good.  The staff were attentive and checked in with us a few times.  The menu was more limited and served smaller portion like tapa style.   Prices are higher than most asian fusion food.  We were here just to snack since we were gambling at the Cosmo.  So, we tried the pork belly bun ($7), shrimp bun ($8) and shishito peppers $9.   At first, I thought it was ridiculous to charge $7 for a small single bun.  But it was totally worth trying the pork belly and shrimp buns.  The pork belly bun is a must try.  It's unbelievably tendered and flavorful.  I would totally come back again to order just the pork belly buns.   The shrimp is a must try too.   It was fresh and flavorful with a good size shrimp.   The shishito peppers was nicely season with a side of spicy sauce.  The spicy kick was nice and different from other shishito peppers I have had.     Overall it was a great experience.  I would come back here again to try more dishes.",

Slightly different? Yeah, but this is not some sort of earth shattering experience. There's a lot better places in Vegas for way less money.   We had a hankering for some ramen and decided to stop in here for a late night dinner. Apparently they don't have ramen on the menu for dinner anymore but they will normally accommodate if you request it (apparently) so we had the pork ramen. It was very good but not anything special enough to write home about. Granted, I have some high standards when it comes to ramen. This was in the top but not THE top, I'll put it that way (the top spot is reserved for Magokoro in Albuquerque).  We also had their oysters and split a pork bun to see how they measured up to others we've had. Everything was great but generally overpriced for what you get. A dozen oysters was $46. There wasn't anything special about them and the sauce/vinegar? (whatever you call it) was just ok. The service was fantastic though. Apparently they also charge you for plain water which is annoying. It was only $2 but to be nickle and dimed at a place this expensive is just plain bad form in my opinion. While overall decent, I don't think we'll be back. There's too many other great places around for as much or more $$$.",

The service was great when we needed water or extras but our server did initially take awhile to come around to get our orders.   Other than that, the food was good but didn't really blow my mind. The pork ramen ... was pork ramen. The pork belly was good and fatty (a bit too fatty) and the broth was flavorful, but the noodles were meh and overall this dish fell flat. The chicken karaage bun, however, was delicious! The dropped off a Korean chili sauce that I slathered all over the chicken and it was really good; perfectly fried and juicy.

    "text": "It took us TOO long to come back here, but the first trip back to Vegas had to include Momofuku.   Since we have not forgotten about those damn life changing rice cakes.   We made it back here on Feb 27, 2019 at lunchtime, which was a totally different atmosphere.  Still fantastic, but much more mellow.  Grant it, it was a Wednesday, vs a Saturday night, but it was absolutely perfect!  We took two friends, who are venturing into the foodie world.  No one was picky, no one had allergies, so we ordered about 6 dishes for 4 people, plenty of varied cocktails and it was STELLAR.  The nuances, complexities and the layers of flavors the chef creates and executes -  can't be contained.   And what makes it more amazing to me, is that yes, a chef created these dishes, but it takes an incredible staff to execute, and front of house to ensure their customers are enjoying their experience and atmosphere as much as the food to back it up.   Momofuku is a must.  And we're already counting down the days to return in November.   Thank you for yet another fantastic meal and afternoon!!",

    "text": "High expectations for the food coming out of Momofuku considering I've watched many specials on David Chang...thanks Mom. Anyways, I hoped with a net worth of 50 million, he would be making money off of delicious food and not crappy food...well I guessed right.   Bookmarked it on Yelp and strolled into the Cosmopolitan this afternoon. I walked up quickly to the hostess' booth like the proud half asian that I am so excited for what was about to enter my mouth that I had the biggest sh** eating grin on. The hostesses greeted me with a less than eager response. Breathe lorynne, I said...you're just too hyped up for everyone right now. The hostess seated us immediately next to another couple. Mind you the restaurant was not busy and no one else was seated right on top of each other. I asked for a table two away from the nearest occupied table and we sat down. Our waitress came over and ran us through everything. I joked with my boyfriend about how she sensed I was Yelp Elite because her spiel was on point...very informative and very genuine.   We ended up ordering a shrimp bun, pork bun, pork ramen and the chilled spicy noodles.  I'm not even sure how they made the shrimp but it was so rich and the texture was not cakey; just chunks of shrimp with a flavor punch of awesome. (You will see the picture, it's so hard to explain.) My pork ramen hit the spot. The broth was jammed with pork flavor; it wasn't a clear cheap broth lol. My egg on top was poached so when I poked it, it ran all over my noodles and basically gave me a foodgasm. The pork itself that was both in the bin and ramen was tender and fatty...just what every girl dreams of at night.   We finish our food and a group of four sits next to us. They have our same waitress and I hear the same exact speech about the restaurant word for word. I no longer felt special and our waitress no longer felt personal. Fast forward, we grab the check and it's $54. My boyfriend puts $60 cash in, hands her the check and says thank you. Then after she walks away he pulls out $6 more dollars and says, \"I can just leave this on the table, right?\" I laugh because she probably thinks she is only getting $6 tip instead of the $12 tip that is actually over 20%. We start walking out towards the door and our waitress is talking about how little of tip we left her to the bartender who was grabbing her change. I told her that the rest was on the table and she giggles and says \"oh thank you so much\". Not very smart of her to talk like that right in the pathway to the exit.   To the chef today, your food was perfect. David Chang, I see why your restaurants and you in general are so successful. But between the bitter hostesses and our waitress making such a silly error like talking bad about customers when they are right in the vicinity, it was a semi-rough visit.",

    "text": "I went twice to this restaurant now.  And I can honestly say, the service and treatment I received between the 2 days was like night and day.  But let me start from the beginning.  The 1st time I visited this restaurant was on a Sunday night.  There was a steady crowd there, but the restaurant wasn't full.    AMBIANCE:  Clean and trendy.  A little noisy since we were seated at the bar seats by the cooking area.    SERVICE 1ST VISIT:  We were greeted by the hostess and seated by the cooks station.  We made contact with our waitress 3 times the whole time we were there: 1) to take our orders 2) when we were done with our meals, she came by to ask us if we wanted dessert 3) to deliver our bill.  Surprisingly the night wasn't completely horrible because we were seated in front of a very nice chef named Bob.  Bob was kind enough to have someone get us utensils when we asked him for some.  Bob took away our dishes when he noticed we were done.  At our request, Bob had someone bring us a dessert menu when our waitress failed to return with one.  He also engaged us with some small talk,  which made the visit more personable.  There was also another person that came by to fill our drinks.  So where was our waitress the whole time we were there?  I'd like to say she was busy with another customer, but I saw her hanging out by the cash register with other servers.  I'd give you her name, but she never told us her name to begin with.  Out of courtesy, we still tipped our waitress, but we left an even bigger tip for Bob who saved the day.  SERVICE 2ND VISIT:  We couldn't have asked for better customer service.  Every worker we encountered introduced themselves to us as they attended to our needs.  We had utensils without having to ask for them.  Our drinks were filled as needed.  And the staff came by more than once during our meal to make sure all our needs were attended to.  A couple staff members also engaged us in light conversation as we asked them questions.  Service was prompt, polite, attentive, and with a smile.  FOOD:  I have nothing negative to say about the quality and presentation and flavor of the food from both visits.  I don't get impressed very often when it comes to food, but Momofuku has made me a believer! They were absolutely delicious dishes! And just as creative and beautiful as they were mouth watering.  Please feel free to review all the photos I have included with this review to appreciate the craftsmanship of each dish.  Hats off to all the chefs!    At the 1st visit, I ordered the Sichuan Lamb Ribs with smashed cucumber and chili yogurt.  I also ordered the Hamachi with bacon ponzu, fresno chilies, and sorrel.  My sister ordered the Chickpea Ramen with scallion, chickpea miso, and bok choy.  We shared a slice crack pie, which is a new found favorite for me.    At the 2nd visit, we had the Honeycrisp Apple Salad with kimchi, maple labne, and without the bacon; the Shiitake bun with hoisin, scallion, and cucumber; Snapper with fennel, citrus, and Castelvetrano olives; Brussels Sprouts & Cauliflower with fish sauce vinaigrette, and chilies; Crispy Potatoes with truffle, garlic, creme fraiche; Smoked Shishito Peppers with salt and lime; Dry Aged Ribeye cooked medium rare with sesame and glazed root vegetables.  My sister had Roasted Black Cod with piquillo pepper, cabbage, and leek.  And of course, we had the crack pie again.   OUR FAVORITE DISHES: The Hamachi with bacon ponzu, fresno chilies, and sorrel; Chickpea Ramen with scallion, chickpea miso, and bok choy; Shiitake bun with hoisin, scallion, and cucumber; Smoked Shishito Peppers with salt and lime; Roasted Black Cod with piquillo pepper, cabbage, and leek; and the crack pie.  If the service was severely lacking from our waitress the 1st time, why would we even bother to come back a second time?  We felt the management at the restaurant should know where improvements could be made with their customer service.  They in turn asked us to return to give them another try.  The manager we contacted stated what we experienced in our 1st visit was not the typical reflection of their services and would love to be given the opportunity to make it right.  And I am so glad we did.  CONCLUSION:  If I were to rate only my 1st visit, I'd give them 2 stars for the severe lack of customer service.  If i were to rate only my 2nd visit, I would have given them 5 stars.  With my overall experience, I rated them 4 stars.  1 star off because of the lack of customer service from the 1st visit.  Would I come here again?  YES.  Impeccable service during the 2nd visit and always phenomenal food.  Thank you Bob the chef and all the staff that made our visit to your restaurant memorable and delicious!",

    "text": "Even though we had reservations, we were directed to sit at the bar or wait for a table. The bar was an interesting choice, because we could see everyone preparing the food, but it would have been nice to have had something a bit more intimate.  They waste a lot of gloves. Like a lot. I think we saw one guy throw away a pair of gloves at least every minute we were sitting at the restaurant. Doesn't seem very environmentally conscious.  My friend got the brussel sprouts, but she didn't finish them, which seemed a bad sign.  We shared the chicken karaage and pork belly sliders. The chicken slider needed something more acidic to accompany it. It was just okay. The pork belly slider was much better, but there was too much hoisin sauce and it overpowered the entire thing.    I also got the ramen, and the pork belly in this was perfection.  Afterwards, we went to Milk Bar. I tried the crack pie, the compost cookie, and the cereal ice cream. The ice cream was not to my liking. I threw it in the trash. That was my fault, because I should have tasted it first. However, I love ice cream - like I should marry it, love it - so there was no reason for me to believe I would toss it all in the garbage. But that's what I did - totally gross.  The cookie was interesting, because it had all kinds of textures and flavors. And the crack pie, while delicious, made me feel like I was killing myself with sugared butter. It's definitely something to share.",

The cocktails are also great.  We had the uni hashbrown which was underwhelming.  The hash brown over powered the uni.  It was a great hash brown, very crispy and tasty.  The uni was amazingly fresh.  The two items separate were great, but not good together.  Also had the ramen and ginger noodles.  Both had great flavor but expensive for noodles.  Overall, good experience.  Skip the noodles...get the bao buns and cocktails!",

THAT salty.  the ginger scallion noodles tasted healthy.  i was in no mood for meat, and ordered it because i was told it was super refreshing.  honestly, i think if the noodles were completely cold it would have made it much better.  the cold refreshing taste of the seaweed, cucumbers and mushrooms was quickly cancelled out by the warm noodles which totally put me off.  the food was definitely whatevs, but the service was GREAT.  located at the cosmo.  make reservations!  ALSO, for the big ass restaurant there is literally 1 woman and 1 male stall.  they do have a restroom right outside the restaurant if you can't hold it :)",

    "text": "I first heard about Momofuku back when David Chang was on Mind of A Chef. He had a certain allure that just made me crave ramen noodles after his episodes. Well, I found myself wandering the streets of Las Vegas and finally decided to satiate my craving!  I ordered the pork belly ramen, and it was amazing. It didn't blow my mind away, but it definitely met the hype and expectations.   Food: Pork belly in the pork belly ramen came apart like butter in my mouth (good sign). Ramen and soup was flavored on point, although I think if you held a gun to my head and made me pick the best noodles, I would still pick Tsujita.   Service: For a not-full restaurant, I thought the service was just slightly slow at first, but picked up. Not really any complaints, just a minor observation.  In conclusion, worth a try while in Vegas (yes, even in the 100 degree heat).",

Desserts were quite serviceable.  Negatives-- sadly, are many. Pork belly bun wasn't bad, but that's about 5 levels removed from how good the original can get in New York. Thai cold noodle was heavy, would've been much better if it was lighter, and the tonkotsu ramen was way too salty.  Service was also inconsistent-- I think they had some Instagram celebrities next to us that sucked up our server's (and the manager's) attention after a while, but that was no excuse...",

Every time I travel to Las Vegas I have to stop here even if it's just for a snack.  I think it has the best pork belly I've ever had and wish there was one closer to us, but probably good I don't since I wound prob be an additional 300lbs.  The service is always amazing and quick. I would highly recommend this place for anyone wanting a food \"simple\" meal.",

We ordered soft boiled eggs, 2 chicken karage bun, 2 pork belly bun, half order of Bo Ssam. We basically rolled out of the restaurant.  Soft boiled eggs - they were good but definitely not a must get  I liked the chicken karage bun more than the pork belly bun. The sauce on the side went really well with the buns.  Bo Ssam - it's a slow braised pork. Half order serves about 4-6 people. It comes with rice, kimchi,  6 half shell oysters, lettuce, and special house sauce. Make sure you shred all the meat and mix it. We made the mistake of not mixing and ended up with all the lean meat at the end. You have to have some fat with each bite of meat. We ended up with left overs and no room for dessert. This is a must get",

I stopped in for lunch and I had such a satisfying experience. My server Josh was awesome -- attentive, yet not intrusive.   I started with the spicy cucumbers (togarashi, toasted almond, scallion). Until today, I did not know it was possible to be \"wowed\" by the humble cucumber.  With each bite, I kept thinking - this cucumber is amazing!    Next I tried the shiitake bun (hoisin, scallion, cucumber). One of the servers brought over ssam sauce and recommended trying it with the bun. Thanks for the tip!  I enjoyed the ssam sauce so much I had to purchase a bottle to take home.   The star of my lunch, however, was the pork ramen (pork belly & shoulder, slow poached egg). So good!  I lingered over this bowl of yum for quite some time. I did not want the meal to end. But I was stuffed so had to say goodbye. (Next time I want to try the dessert!)  Being the forgetful person that I am, I left my ssam sauce in the restaurant.  Someone from the restaurant ran down the escalator to catch me. My hero!  Bottom line: eat here. You won't be disappointed.",

We had such an awesome time sitting at the counter next to the kitchen and chatting with the staff, namely Spencer (I think that's his name?). Very cool, down to earth people. And they even let us try a few things that we didn't order for free. Really opened my eyes about trying foods I wouldn't normally order, so thanks for that!   Although we sat at the counter, there's an awesome view of the strip over in the main dining room and a very cool, trendy atmosphere overall.   I've got to say that I am not a seafood person at all. But here I ate both mussels AND lobster. And they were both great. That says a lot. The shrimp bun I had was really good too. They make the shrimp sort of into a patty and then fry it. Never seen that done before. My girlfriend said the oysters are some of the best she's ever had. So order some of those, she knows her oysters. I didn't have any.   I don't want this review to be too long or crazy. And I don't know enough about this type of food to speak educatedly (is that a word?) about it. But here's what I can tell you. The staff is awesome, the food is delicious, and you will have an awesome time coming here. So go.   Here's my overall ratings: Atmosphere- 4.5/5 Quality/value- 5/5 Service- 5/5 Food- 5/5",

So I can  accept this even though I'm more convinced that it accidentally has vinegar or was spoiled.   I would have been satisfied with this however it feels like a slap in the face that she hopes we come back and she will assist me in making a reservation. -_- we know what this means.... She's asking me to come back, waste my money on an overpriced dinner, know that it's my table and tell her staff to treat me a little better so I can fix my review.   I may give this another chance in a very distant future but I'm more hopeful to have a better dining experience when I try monofuku NYC.   Also, let me know if you start selling your pork Belly online, I'd purchase that for sure.",

    "text": "Adding Momofuku to our list of favorite restaurants in Vegas! We've always wanted to dine at a David Chang restaurant after watching his season of \"The Mind of a Chef\" on Netflix.  After Momofuku's delayed opening during our last visit, we finally came back again once they're open. At first we were disappointed that we waited 45 mins for a table near the back/strip view and ending up getting a kitchen counter seat, but that turned out to be our favorite part. No wait for a bar seat at 6:45 pm on a Saturday.   I love noodles, so we ordered drinks and the Chilled Spicy Noodles and Spicy Sichuan Rice Cakes. We didn't order too much to save room for Milk Bar dessert next door.   Both dishes are quite spicy and cannot be adjusted. My spice handling level is mediocre, and I was able to enjoy both without breathing fire. The Chilled Spicy noodles are cooked al dente, and have a spicy Thai basil type of pesto coating. The little sausages were my favorite part. The Spicy Sichuan Rice Cakes were not as spicy, but still had a kick. The rice cakes are pan fried, which added a little crunch.   The kitchen counter view was exciting, and I loved seeing the chefs plating the dishes. It gave me ideas of what to order next time (the Steamed Whole Branzino looked amazing! Getting it next time!) One of their chefs graciously gave us a sample of lamb with tzatziki. Thank you!  Service was great, no issues. Drinks were always filled.   So many reasons to return: to try the ramen and the branzino, score a strip view table, and hopefully meet David Chang one day (fingers crossed).",

It's basically that for every thing in the strip.  So I'm rating the place as such.  In other words, it's the strip so it's going to be expensive.  I had the pork ramen.  It was very good, rich broth and the right amount of other stuff - not too much, and not skimpy.  The broth wax very rich and flavorful.  The beer selection is well thought out and really good, so I had two craft IPAs.   The service is very good, but you get the feeling that at any moment there's going to be a crash between the wait staff due to the pace that they're moving.  The uniforms they wear, and the professionalism is very good, but they need to smile more.  At the end of the day, the staff is very good.  This place is an example of hiring good hostesses.  Very professional, not untrained eighteen year olds.  They were well mannered, professional, and seemed to get the whole customer service thing too.  They need to smile more though.  But again, very good hostesses to kick off the customer experience.  It was good, but paying 3X for what I pay for excellent ramen back home makes me take pause.  Of course, the vibe is cooler, and that does matter.  If you're on the strip give it a shot.  Everything is expensive on the strip, but quite frankly as far as the strip restaurants go, this might be one of the better values.",

We had a food orgy, loaded up on buns, ramen, pork, salad, while bronzino, then roast chicken and duck.  Highlights are the pork buns, duck and chicken. With Both the duck and the chicken they take the carcass after carving and deep fry them.  No Breading, just crispy and well salted bits of chicken and duck carcass with little morsels of fat and meat found sporadically.  Absolutely to die for and a highlight of the meal.  The duck is sliced tableside which was a major tease as it took our server about 10 minutes.  But she did make use of all the meat, tearing off the little pieces and placing them in the center of the rice platter it's served with.  The duck was legit and should not be missed.  The finally   Was a 6\" birthday cake cake which was awesome as well.  It's not often an outpost lives up to  the original, but this place does.",

    "text": "Great service and delicious food. We even lucked out and got seated immediately at the bar. I highly recommend the Yuzu Lemonade. Made fresh, with a great balance between tart and sweet. All the good things of plain ole lemonade, amplified. We grazed on a number of small dishes, from cucumber salad to pork belly buns. All were delicious. We rounded out the meal with a bowl of ramen, and the noodles had that perfect bouncy, chewy consistency. If I'm ever back on the Strip for business or pleasure, I'll eat here again in a heartbeat.",

Even as a vegetarian and with Momofuku's limited vegetarian offerings, there are plenty of choices and they are absolutely delicious. The ginger scallion noodles are so wonderful I've begun to make them at home, the chickpea ramen is crazy good, the shiitake buns are savory and everything else I've tried is delectable. I'll also add that the margarita there is one of the best I've tried. I can't get enough of this place; I even dream about it. So grateful for this closer location.",
