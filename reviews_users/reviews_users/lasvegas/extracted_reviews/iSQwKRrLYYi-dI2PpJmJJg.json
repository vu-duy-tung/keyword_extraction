Right when we arrived, the waiter let us know that it was happy hour, so we ordered two small bottles of nigori sake at buy 1, get 1 free! He even let us know that if we ordered a larger bottle and didn't finish it, they would label it and keep it in the back for us so we would have it for our next visit. What restaurant do you know that does that? Awesome!  The company I was with knew the sushi chef and the chef let us know right away what the freshest fish of the day was. So that's exactly what we ordered.  We had 2 orders of each:  Yellow Tail Belly Albacore Mackerel Freshwater Eel Tuna Salmon (I'm forgetting a few)  All were melt-in-your-mouth DELICIOUS! I have to point out the Eel, because normally, I don't like Eel because some restaurants drench the eel is over-the-top sweet teriyaki sauce, but not at Kaizen. Wow, the way they prepare the eel is perfection and only brings out the natural beautiful flavors of the fish. Also another plus is they didn't use too much rice in any of the sushi where its overbearing.  Definitely a must try!",

When getting my order wrong I had politely brought it to their attention. They then ignored me as I watched my newly made order sit for 10 min. When I had inquired about my meal they then decided it was time to bring it to me. I had a cockroach interfere with my dinning endeavor and they didn't do anything to compensate for it. On a seperate occasion my friend had a dead bug fall out of his napkin while I was with him during this disaster.  Lastly, their quality in fish is terrible and gave me food poisoning.  I have given this place many chances... but this city should know.. that if you are flying overseas as I will be doing so tomorrow.. you do not want poorly done fish and unhealthily prepared food that makes upchucking the boogie a possibility on the plane.. If that was the case I could've licked the bottom of my gym shoes and still felt better than I do now after consuming that toxicity..",

Kaizen has quickly become my favorite all you can eat sushi place in town.  It's got great modern decor and every seat has an angle to a tv.  There is usually hip hop/top 40 music playing and on the main tv, they'll play the videos. Off topic but Flo Rida's Let it Roll video is hilarious.  I probably wouldn't have seen it if it weren't for Kaizen.  Thank you Kaizen video person.  Great decor and funny videos aside, the reason Kaizen get 5 stars from me is the food is de-lish!  It's re-dic good! Yeah, I just said \"re-dic\"! I recently took my cousin there and after eating some yellowtail belly nigiri, he just smiled and said \"this is f'n' delicious\".  They have some items that you are limited to 2 pieces but you gotta order them.  Definitely get the toro, yellowtail belly, hamachi sashimi with jalepeno, albacore with fried onions, most places won't even offer these on their ayce menus. The saba, cajun albacore, super white are wonderful, too.  I haven't even gotten to how good the rolls are.  The avocado train and snow white are standouts for me.  There's also an extensive appetizer list.  Grilled shishinto peppers are bomb!  Who even does shishinto peppers at ayce? Kaizen does, that's who!  I'm usually stuffed by dessert but I force down some strawberry mochi and creme brulee which I end up regretting but I can always do some cardio the next day.  I thank my friend for having his birthday at Kaizen. I love it here.  Oh, another plus is they do a stamp card.  Buy 10 get 1 free, now if I could only remember to bring my stamp card.  Hope you enjoy it as much as I have.",

    "text": "Let me say that this used to be one of my favorite sushi places in the valley.  I could care less that it wasn't all you could eat in the past because it was good quality and a pretty cool atmosphere.  Whenever I would go they would remember me and even my favorite rolls, the sushi chefs were super fun to talk to, and when eric was still there he would make up the most awesome presentations.  Gradually the quality of the sushi went down, and then eric disappeared, and the rolls coming out didn't even look or taste like their description or what I knew they were supposed to be.  They switched to all you can eat and several months ago (yes I took a while to write this) when we went it just was the last straw, the fish in those rolls was such bad quality I was a bit worried to eat it, almost every roll I ordered was made wrong, and the wait staff that used to be a really well oiled and cohesive unit was very disjointed.  It sucks they have gone so downhill when they used to be so awesome.  I wont be going back again.",

Waitress offered us drinks while we were waiting which was nice. Once we were seated, drunk order was taken and brought quickly. We ordered appetizers, shishito peppers, seaweed salad, edamame, and shrimp tempura. They all tastes perfectly good. Except the shrimp tempura we had to ask for 3 times because it never showed up to our table. Also servers were kind of scattered, we had 3 different ones checking on us. Sushi was average quality for an ayce sushi place and didn't really stand out to me. Orange blossom roll was tasty and my favorite of the night. We then ordered banana tempura ice cream dessert that they had. Another issue was here because the bananas tasted like the shrimp that had been fried in the same oil as the bananas. That was a turn off. I personally have had better ayce sushi in Las Vegas and this place was at best low to mid range on my personal list.",

    "text": "Upon walking into this sleek establishment, the first thing one notices is the placement of the sushi bar at the center of the restaurant, where all can observe the chef at work.  Perhaps it was the understated but self-assured way I was acknowledged from the head sushi chef upon walking in, but I just had an immediate strong impression that I would be well taken care of, and my instincts were not off.    Call me a traditionalist, but I haven't fully embraced the trend for sushi that is overdressed with multiple types of fish and lathered with bold sauces (am I the only person who finds the term \"orgasm sauce\" to sound completely unappetizing?!) since sushi is a celebration of the intrinsic flavor of the fish, and the former style can often mask or compensate for mediocre sushi.   Therefore, I went with some traditional sushi rather than go for the combination rolls (although ones which stood out upon perusing the menu was a tuna roll with mango topped with salmon and a king crab/lobster roll wrapped in halibut).  They have a special menu near the back pages that offer \"half-priced\" sushi all the time (makes me wonder when it is full price) but semantics aside, I received a reasonable deal with 2 pieces each of red snapper, yellow-tail, halibut, yellow tail belly, and sweet shrimp for less than 20 bucks.    All the fish were extremely fresh and the chef does a good job with proportioning the fish/rice ratio.  The stars for me were the sweet shrimp and the yellowtail belly.  The sweet shrimp has a velvety sweet texture and it slips right off the slightest bit of tail left on probably for aesthetics.  The two pieces are also served alongside two perfectly deep-fried shrimp heads which makes it seem like a 4 piece order.  This additional bonus piece was an unexpected bite of heaven since it was like combining the most perfect shrimp chip, soft shell crab, and the innards of regular crab all into one glorious fusion of texture and flavor.  There was also something primal about being able to devour the whole thing since it appears as though it would not be digestable based on appearance alone.  The tell-tale sign that I would return was upon being served the yellow-tail belly.  The server presented me with some yellow-tail belly that had been diced into 8-9 pieces and apologized that the chef was down to a portion that was not able to be fashioned into a nigiri, but just received a fresh shipment that he would serve on the house if I was willing to wait an extra 15 minutes (I should mention both portions were excellent).   The fact that I received a double portion and the chef's insistence that I get the freshest cut of his fish at no additional charge  speaks highly on his craft and loyalty towards his patrons.  The meal concluded with an artistic palate cleanser of an orange served with the skin off and sectioned inside it's rind which probably took an additional 5-10 minutes to prepare versus cutting them into simple wedges, but sometimes little touches go a long way.",

As excited as I was for sushi, let me just tell you that the service ruined it for me. I did the AYCE cause I love sushi and can eat a lot of it! Ordered a few appetizers, got 2 out of 3 that I ordered. She had a pen and a note pad and I thought she had written my order. My sushi came in one order at a time and with a 10 minute interval, but really felt like 15-20 minutes. Before you order, server tells you they charge extra for sushi you haven't ate. I ordered one baked roll that I liked but that roll sat in a platter on the sushi bar for more than 5 minutes. I was almost tempted to get it myself! I'm sorry but they deserved 1 star. Sushi could have been made faster with 3 sushi chefs and not much customers. Service needs work. Not to mention, my green tea ice cream took at least 10 minutes to come out. It takes less than 5 minutes: grab a bowl, scoop ice cream choice of customer, add a spoon and deliver to the customers table. Please Kaizen, let's work on food punctuality!!!!!",

I ordered the special of the day which was sea scallops but I ordered it is sashimi, in order of Yellowtail sashimi and also a dinner bento box. The sushi was okay it was fresh but small pieces. The bento box was horrible... The kalbi which is the Korean short ribs were inedible and from the pictures you can tell they were overcooked and super chewy.  We complained to the manager and he told us he would take 25% off but when I got the receipt he took off 25% of just the bento box. I thought that was ridiculous, cheap of the restaurant and I will never ever be a patron at this establishment again. They say if you leave a review and show it to them they'll give you an item or a drink for free. To me writing this review and foregoing a free drink was well worth anything that they could have offered.",

Food: AYCE. We tried a variety of nigiri (tuna, unagi, salmon, seated albacore, garlic tuna) and a shrimp tempura roll. The rice was all wrong. Too much vinegar and compressed so tightly. Visually the fish quality was low. The shrimp tempura was cold in the roll so not sure when they fried it (yesterday?)  Service: slow. Not one waiter is dedicated to a particular table so it's hap-hazard.

We got our food fast ONLY when it seemed to be super busy. Once people started leaving and it wasn't getting as busy, it took forever to get our food. We would have to ask 5x where our order was and sometimes we didn't even get it.   We were there for a total of 3hrs w 4 people. I've never been at an AYCE sushi place that long. That's how slow they were.   The food itself is good. The pork belly was amazing. The 2 things I didn't like out of all the food we ordered was the udon noodles and the nigiri sushi. The soup for the udon noodle was very very sweet which was nasty. The nigiri has WAY to much rice. If you are a nigiri eater only, I'd suggest going to sushi neko on spring mountain and Decatur. They have really good food and service but menu is not as extensive as here.",

I waited a minute and when I saw somebody I knocked to asked why they were closing early, he said that that last seating was a midnight ... I told Daniel (the name of the guy who answered the door that it was just about to turn midnight and his answer was \"No\" LOL ...

    "text": "Strange mixed bag here.  The food that we got was good - although it was not necessarily what we ordered.  We sat at the sushi bar, and were immediately greeted by several very pleasant servers in quick succession. The first took our drink orders. The second took our first sushi order.  The third, fourth, and fifth, we just thanked politely.  Even though it was not crowded (many open tables, and an almost empty sushi bar) it took about a half hour to get our first few pieces of nigiri sushi. We never did get the rolls that we ordered.  The rest of the evening was a drawn-out comedy of lost orders, wrong orders, random rolls, and some pretty good food. In general, the rolls were overly sauced for my taste. I actually like to taste the fish.  So: Clean place, friendly waitstaff, totally confused ordering process, heavily drowned rolls.  All of this I can forgive - but here's why I probably won't return:   I don't like restaurants with TVs. I mean, in a sports bar, sure - but not in a place where I want to enjoy a meal with a friend. They are conversation killers. People (especially guys) are constantly getting distracted. Kaizen has many big-screen TVs - with at least one in any direction that you look.   I want to enjoy my meal and conversation uninterrupted by an ADHD nightmare of football, music videos, and flashy ads for the restaurant in which you are currently dining (?!?) all playing concurrently. Too much for me.  ...and a note about the oysters: I love oysters, and was excited that they were part of the AYCE menu here. Sadly, I did not like the sauce that was served on the oysters at all. Again - I want to taste the oysters. These were presented primarily as a conveyance for the sauce.  2.5 stars, rounded up for the friendly staff.",

Soups, salads, appetizers, sashimi, sushi, specials rolls, fried rolls, ice cream, etc. The trick is to avoid getting large rolls where you're going to be having a lot of rice. You'll be done after only a few - to get your $26 bucks you've got to be strategic: Sashimi and sushi, and save the beer for later. The chefs are very friendly and the service is quick - they seem to have a lot of regulars which is a good sign - who knows, maybe i'm becoming one. Recommend trying out the lunch all you can eat (5 or so bucks cheaper) first to check the place out and go from there.  I left happy both times. All in all not the best sushi i've had, but it does the trick and is well worth the money.",

We decided to order the 2nd round while still waiting for the 1st round of food because we didn't want to keep waiting so long and the waiter asks \"You want to order dessert now?\" Umm...hello!

We were seated and the service seemed fast and friendly. We placed our order for food and drinks with no issues. We ordered 3 half rolls, 1 whole roll, & 5 appetizers.   Our rolls arrived to the table before the appetizers. This is not unusual in a sushi restaurant but when we finished our rolls and our appetizers did not come we got worried.  We were asked if we wanted to order more food. We said no, just the appetizers. We waited about 20 minutes before the appetizers had arrived. I repeat. I was finished with my food 20 minutes before the appetizers even came. A little upsetting. Pork belly was delicious.  Other appetizers were burnt.   This was a very disappointing experience. I may come back. But not during work lunch with other appointments to make.",

I've managed to cash in one stamp card during this time and have one more stamp to go before I cash in another. Convenience and VIP service keep us coming back.  Probably 90% of the trips we've made to Kaizen have been on Monday nights after we've watched the football game over at B Dubs. Making the hundred foot walk to stuff ourselves and have BOGO sakes for $27 is an easy one. I can imagine what the sushi chefs are thinking when they see four of us come strolling over around 9 PM.  Wei has been our server and he knows pretty much what we want every time. There's no wait to place our next order because he knows to take it as soon as the food is dropped off. We've had no problems with the sushi and the selection of hot and cold tapas is pretty ridiculous. You're limited to one order of pork belly, but it's completely understandable because we'd have 5 orders a piece of the best item if we could.  When I bring the non sushi eating family, the boxes and rice bowls are plenty sufficient for them. It does get busy and on a wait during dinner, but we've yet to experience one when we go around 9. This has been my top pick for a while and I really don't see it changing any time soon.",

The menu is extensive with tons of appetizers, nigiri, rolls and even sashimi dishes that you can order. The sashimi dishes were all spot on, we ordered a yellowtail dish, salmon dish and the oysters with ponzu. We tried about 3 or 4 rolls (def recommend the snakebite roll), a bunch of nigiri, worked our way through the appetizers (the only thing I don't recommend is the spicy garlic edamame, the seasoning was too wet and too much), and then of course all the deserts (green tea creme brulee for the win)!  The place is cute and clean, for those of you who left comments that you didn't like the atmosphere I assume you like the dirty, hole in the wall atmosphere? The service was AMAZING, we had Dakota as our server and we can't give her high enough praise. For $28 for AYCE dinner it is well worth it. We will definitely be bringing some family here when they are in town next -- this place is also great for non-fish people because of the plentiful non-fish appetizer selection.  Haven't tried it and wanting to try a new AYCE sushi place? Definitely give it a go!",

    "text": "I decided on this location for AYCE Mother's Day dinner. The reviews for their food were favorable but I was apprehensive about traveling from the northwest with the reviews about their customer service.   It was very busy for Mother's Day and with a reservation we didn't have to wait long for a table. We were promptly greeted with a friendly tall server with glasses asking us what we would like to drink.  A very kind, helpful and conscientious female server took our order. We were consistently checked on by her, the tall guy and a petite young gal with beverage refills, clearing of our empty plates, explanation of menu items and asking what else we would like to order. Everything was presented nicely and fresh. The four of us enjoyed everything from salads, soup, hot appetizers, nigiri, rolls, huge yellowtail collars and ice cream. There was so much more I wanted to try but didn't have the room.   As a culinary professional, I have 2 tips I hope they read. All the fried foods we ordered were greasy. The fry station person needs further training in frying. The oil wasn't hot enough therefore the food is sitting in the oil too long to get golden and it looks like the food is not being drained on a rack. If this is done correctly, the oil absorbing doilies the food is served on would not be soaked when brought to the table. The vegetable tempera needed more batter, the block chunk of zucchini was so thick it was raw, the pancakes, tako balls, katsu were saturated in oil making it too greasy to enjoy. With training this problem could be fixed. Also, the tempura sauce had no flavor.    For a busy night, I didn't feel the wait that others reviewed between getting our food was unacceptable. I enjoyed trying a AYCE spot on the other side of town. When I'm out that way, I'd stop in again to try the things I was too full to try the first time. Thank you to the kind server once again. She even came to the door with a farewell send off to tell us thank you and good-bye! That scored major points with my Korean mom. Kamsahamnida",

Today I tried their all you can eat sushi with my man and learned that I will just stick to entrees.  Service was amazing. People always checked on us constantly. Really friendly people and apologized for the wait.   Food was also amazing. Try the oysters! Their sushi tasted as good as any ayce sushi spot and they even offer 2 for 1 drinks late night with it (9pm-12am I think).   Wait time was what made the experience yucky and truly unpleasant. Not the seating wait time but for your actual food to come out, IF it comes out. It is understandable for us that it is busy and maybe a 30 minute wait for the minimal amount of sushi that we ordered is still ok. We were there for 2 HOURS and barely got most of the sushi we ordered as the restaurant started getting less busy. We've even asked our servers if our food was coming or not and still the things we ordered again did not come the entire time we were there.  For $27, I could easily recommend another local sushi spot for a better experience for the same service and food quality.",

    "text": "Fantastic.  I only noticed recently that these guys have entered the league of AYCE sushi restaurants, and what an entrance it is. Toro (1 piece) and yellowtail belly (2) one-per-person on the _regular_ dinner menu. Yellowtail and salmon belly too. Yellowtail and albacore sashimi options. Extensive appetizer and small entree menu that reminds me of Umiya.  Heck, unlike some desserts weren't even limited, other than tempura ice cream and creme brulee being one for person. Man, I wish they hadn't been out of green tea creme brulee so that I might be able to compare it favorably to Goyemon's... But you know what, I still can do it because of excellent overall sushi quality. And because of the Ice Cream In Your Mouth dessert roll that kinda blew my mind. Save room for it when you go!  The service could have been a little better, but it was on par with my last Goyemon visit. After one visit, this joint is now easily in my top 4. You need to try this if you are a regular of Sushi Mon or another nearby sushi place. Or a non-nearby sushi place. Just go.",

We were asked by 3 different  people for drinks....and then they all disappeared. We hunted down one gal, and ordered. Because alot of the items are 1 order per person... like oysters,  we both ordered the items.  The rolls were just okay. The best one we had was.... i like my ass, or something  to that effect.  It was fresh, and had a decent  amount of flavor.   Other than that the bacon wrapped shrimp, and the SINGLE order of oysters we received ...everything  just tasted like mush.   Even with fish just over the rice, the rice was so soft, you can't  even pick it up with your chopsticks without the rice breaking in half, and then falling all over the yable, and plate.  Whenever  we would ask for our second order of things... like our oysters  (which were fucking raw, btw, they didnt have to cook). We were told to just wait and that they were coming....they never did.  So, we just waited, like we were told, and 20 or so minutes  would go by...so we would ask  again...  \"Just wait.\"  Ohhkaaay.  Asked for the check  twice.  Paid, signed and left the slip on the table.  My family  and i are then chased  out to our SUV like we're criminals, by a guy telling us that he needed my signature copy. That i took all the papers.  Well, yes, theres your copy, and then theres MY copy for my records.  Look on the table before  you come running  out to us.  Lack luster  food, rude service,  and forgotten  items.   Thanks but no thanks",

    "text": "Kaizen has been my go to sushi place for quite a while now, but after my experience last night I'm hesitant to return.   Usually I can deal with their somewhat bad service because I'm so wrapped up in how good the food is, but last night was a lose-lose & I left hungry & annoyed that I paid $27 plus automatic gratuity for my meal.   One dish after another came out cold or poorly prepared. One of the first plates dropped at our table was the Snow White. As hungry as I was, I dove in without hesitation & was met with a nice large bone. I brushed it off, set the bone aside & moved on to the next dish, the Silver State, a baked roll with cream cheese, yamagobo, crab & some other yummy ingredients. Did I mention it was a baked roll? Yeah well, that came out cold.. Do you know how long a baked roll has to sit around outside the oven before it gets cold? About 7-10 minutes. How do I know this? I, too, work at a sushi place.   After that came the pork belly... 2 pieces in an order. One piece came out warm & the other came out stone cold. The steamed gyoza came out slimy because it had been sitting in a plate of excess water. My miso was lukewarm. I DIDNT EVEN EAT MY TEMPURA ICE CREAM BECAUSE IT WASNT FRESH. Anything fried in oil needs to be served immediately to avoid becoming like a stale french fry! & my poor tempura ice cream was definitely a sad, stale, french fry.... :(   For those brave enough to head out to Kaizen to try their luck please contact me because I have 10 stamps on my stamp card & I WILL NOT be back to claim my free meal.",

The food came out fast and the selection was really good.   They allow an order for higher quality sashimi orders like toro when a lot of other places won't even allow it for AYCE. They also offered yellowtail belly which is amazing. Their rolls are a little smaller, which benefits the customer (in my opinion) bc it allows you to order other items without getting too full too fast.   Thy also have a ton of dessert items. The \"Banana\" roll was a little weird but \"Ice Cream In Your Mouth\" roll was awesome. We also tried pretty much all the other dessert items. The tempura cheesecake was creamy goodness. The mini honey toast was simple but I loved it since it used a Hawaiian roll.   This place is great. I think I even like it better than Sushimon, but it's hard to say that after only one visit. I will say this, if the service continues to be as it was for our party today, this will easily be the my favorite AYCE sushi joint.",

There is a server almost throwing the plates to our table( we don't know if he is in a rush or the restaurant is too busy or whatever....), and the food were almost out of the plate and he didn't even say anything and treat that as normal!!! What a speechless experience First time, and the Last time too!",

    "text": "TL;DR - A quality AYCE sushi bar right outside Vegas. Beats out most of the sushi places in the Bay Area. Delicious food for a great value, but service is sometimes spotty. Would definitely come back here while in Vegas!  I've been here once before, but never thought to write a review because I thought I wouldn't be back.  Well, I did. And here are my impressions.  $27 for an AYCE sushi dinner is a great value, considering it's Vegas, of course. I was here with a large group. There was little wait, but we already had a reservation here, so no worries there.  As with any AYCE restaurant that is NOT a buffet, there is a sort of time limit. This restaurant has set a 90-minute limit for eating, but we were here for over 2 hours!  Onto the food. I ordered quite a bit of food, so I'll have to break it down dish by dish.  I started off with the Tuna Poke salad. Very small for an appetizer, but damn, it packs a punch of spicy! Fish was very fresh and cleanly cut. Seaweed was fresh and cold.  I then ordered a spicy tuna hand roll. Lots of spicy tuna, which was a HUGE plus for me! Spiciness was subtle, but there were no vegetables, not even a slice of cucumber, to add a fresh crunch.  My sister and I then ordered the Rainbow and Dragon rolls. The Dragon had flavor, but it's just your standard California roll with unagi on the top. Nothing too special there. The Rainbow is exactly the same, but with different fish to top.   I looked at the menu and saw this Pork Belly appetizer. I knew I had to order it.  Perfectly executed, with lots of flavor to compliment! Green onions on the top add a freshness that compliments the pork even further.  Fresh oysters...an appetizer most sushi places in the Bay serve. Flavor was there for sure, and presentation was on point! A bit small, but I think that's because it isn't oyster season.  More appetizers. I ordered a bacon and shrimp skewer and some sashimi (I forgot what fish).  This bacon and shrimp skewer was some of the worst I've seen. It looks charred, maybe burnt a little. Messy presentation. Flavor was subpar. This is an appetizer I WOULD NOT recommend.  The sashimi, however, was a completely different story. The one I actually ate had a smoky flavor to it, which was interesting, but something I actually really enjoyed. A crunchy topping sealed the deal with presentation. Excellent. Wish I could tell what it was, but I completely forgot.  Baked mussels and jalapeno poppers sealed off the main meal. The mussels had a deep flavor to them, but its freshness was completely covered over by the cheese, sauce, and fish egg topping. The jalapeno poppers packed a HUGE punch of flavor AND spice, but I'll leave to you guys to try it. Or maybe it's just me. I don't really know.  For dessert, I ordered the vanilla creme brulee. But...they ran out of vanilla. And the servers running around the restaurant didn't notify me until AFTER I asked to check with the kitchen AFTER waiting 20+ minutes for it to come out. I settled for the green tea instead. Flavor was there, but inconsistent. Some parts of the brulee were sweet, whereas others were...bitter, but that was in part due to HOW creme brulee is made.  Service was spotty, for lack of a better word. Some servers were quick to take my orders, while others took a while to come to me, and some servers told me that I wasn't their server. I'm like, \"OK, but you're still a server. You should be taking my order, no matter which table you're 'assigned' to.\" And then that snafu I mentioned above.  TL;DR at the top of this review.",

    "text": "Usually I can deal with their bad service but our server was especially rude and the food was awful too.   Wait time was what made the experience yucky and truly unpleasant. Not the seating wait time but for your actual food to come out, IF it comes out. It is understandable for us that it is busy and maybe a 30 minute wait for the minimal amount of sushi that we ordered is still ok. We were there for 2 HOURS and barely got most of the sushi we ordered as the restaurant started getting less busy. We've even asked our servers if our food was coming or not and still the things we ordered again did not come the entire time we were there.  One dish after another came out cold or poorly prepared. One of the first plates dropped at our table was the Snow White. As hungry as I was, I dove in without hesitation & was met with a nice large bone. I brushed it off, set the bone aside & moved on to the next dish, the Silver State, a baked roll with cream cheese, yamagobo, crab & some other yummy ingredients. Did I mention it was a baked roll? Yeah well, that came out cold.. Do you know how long a baked roll has to sit around outside the oven before it gets cold? About 7-10 minutes. How do I know this? I, too, work at a sushi place.   After that came the pork belly... 2 pieces in an order. One piece came out warm & the other came out stone cold. The steamed gyoza came out slimy because it had been sitting in a plate of excess water. My miso was lukewarm. I DIDNT EVEN EAT MY TEMPURA ICE CREAM BECAUSE IT WASNT FRESH. Anything fried in oil needs to be served immediately to avoid becoming like a stale french fry! I could also saw and heard a bald man with glasses yelling at another coworker which made me feel uncomfortable.  For those brave enough to head out to Kaizen to try their luck please contact me because I have 10 stamps on my stamp card & I WILL NOT be back to claim my free meal.",

Able to try out more of the rolls that way and not have to force yourself to eat 8 pieces of something you're not sure you'll like or not. Staff is very friendly and gave several recommendations after we told them it was our first time there. My favorite roll was the orange blossom! I also like that you're able to order hot foods as part of the AYCE too--gyoza, kalbi, ramen, fried rice, etc. Lastly a punch card so that your 11th AYCE is free--hooray!",

Not once did we ever feel rushed.  Since it was our first time, our waitress walked us through the menu and let us know which foods were not apart of the AYCE. We were informed that if there was a roll we wanted to try, but their was something we didn't want, we could ask to not have that one item included. If we didn't like a certain roll, we were told to just let them know. Our waitress told us, \"we don't want to waste food, but we also don't want you to feel forced to eat something you don't like.\"   Someone was always stopping by our table to make sure the food was good, if we needed a refill, or if we were okay.  We also found out that they are very children friendly. 4-years-old eat for free, including AYCE and 5 - 11 years eat half price.   I would highly recommend this place to anyone who is either eating sushi for the first time or if they're sushi lovers and are craving some.",

They also have a lit up board with some daily fish specials that's included in the all you can eat. The sushi chef was friendly and service from sushi counter was good. The service from waitress slash hostess was a bit slow in the beginning since she was doing dual roles. As the meal progressed so did the service to the good side.  Kaizen sushi is one of the smallest sushi bars in the local area I've been too but the sushi was on par or better than most. Some of the appetizers from the kitchen was a bit slow and took awhile even tho it was not that busy when I went there Sunday when they opened at 4pm.  Id definitely go back again when I'm in the green valley area.   1. They so so half rolls  2. Fish to rice ration was not bad.  3. Tons of appetizer options, you can over do it and get full just on the different appetizers.",

Meaning it's fresh, delicious, they don't put ten pounds of rice in your sushi to try and get you full etc.  the food is truly normal portions that you would get st non AYCE places.  The fish is fresh.  Some AYCE please lacks quality but this place has great wiki style, a creative menu with just about everything (appetizers, noodles, udon, ramen etc) and their sushi tastes great.  Love this place and now one of my favorite sushi spots.",

Price for all you can eat is perfect!!",

The variety is great, the service is wonderful and the is very restaurant clean.  I am a mother of three, one teen and two tweens and boy can they EAT!  Things you should know before you go...Dinner pricing begins at 4pm, kids over 10 are charged as an adult, drinks are not part of the AYCE menu however dessert is and they give you a 90 minute timeline to eat!!  My favorite items were the Orange Blossom, the Rock and Roll, the Caterpillar Roll, the Monkey Brains and the Avocado Train.  Although I'm not a big AYCE fan, my kids ARE so I will keep Kaizen in our AYCE sushi rotation.",

I also ordered a variety of rolls. The appetizers were ok and the rolls were ok too. The best I have ever had? No. But pretty good quality for all you can eat. I really appreciated the option to order half a roll of sushi. That way I could get more variety without getting full on just 2 rolls. I ordered their house wine for $5 and it was ok. I was sitting close to the kitchen and I could see boxes of Franzia boxed wine...which makes me believe that is their house wine.   For dessert I had their fried ice cream and cheesecake. The cheesecake was still kind of frozen...which makes me think they do not make it there. The ice cream as pretty good.   Overall, I think it's pretty good. I would go back again if I was in the area.",

We had two servers, both that were very attentive and helpful our entire time there.  Prices are average for it being all you can eat. Not to mention... their menu is HUGE! From appetizers to fried food to long rolls and even dessert. I'll have to come back at least two more times to try everything that I want to without getting so full!   But so far, everything I ordered was great and there was no leftovers. One thing that I liked most was that you could order half of their long rolls so you are able to try more rolls in one sitting.  I deduct one star because I was disappointed with their dessert. We ordered the mini honey toast with chocolate ice cream and took about 15 minutes to get to us. Even more disappointed when the toast was not toasted, the edges were just a little burnt. Bleh. Next time I'll stick to the mochi ice cream. But other than that I was completely satisfied with everything and will definitely be back!",

Firstly, the service was really good! Everyone was so welcoming from beginning to end. The kind asian guy with glasses and tattoos and the sweet gal with rockin' red hair. The ambiance is pleasant not overwhelming and just overall a nice place to enjoy good sushi and other delectable appetizers. Don't forget the beverages either! They have wine and a nice little bar. We like their selection alot, I got Japanese Lasagna rolls and this amazing Sex Bomb one. Also Ribeye steak and delicious cheesecake and ice cream. If you like spicy they have this yummy sauce called Ass Sauce and Yum Yum rolls too! My husband and I look forward to our next sushi experience here next time we are in the area!",

The sushi menu is broken up by that type of roll (tempura, fried, etc.) and I like this because it helps me skip ones I know I wouldn't want (like fried rolls.)  There's a limit on the amount for a lot of the items so this kind of sucks but hey its great for when the people you are with don't like items you do (yellowtail belly!)

They also had a bento box deal that was great. We tried the Short-ribs, gyoza, and tempura shrimp. It was all very good. We'll be heading back, Groupon or not and recommending it to all of our friends.   The prices for sushi might seem to be high, but for the LV area are pretty low. Their food prices are great.",

When myself friend and I arrived we were the only guests.  We were seated right away, our orders were taken in appropriate time and our food came out fast.  The rest of the time our server was pacing the floor yet not getting that we were ready for the check.  I don't know if he was trying to not rush us out or what but it took way too long to cash out.  We had to stand up to give him the hint that we were ready to leave.  I did like the sushi although I think other restaurants serve more at that price.  The place looked nice, had flashy neon specials signs, funny names for the dishes, and today's hit songs playing in a big screen t.v.  I am not usually in the Henderson area so I probably won't be back but it is a decent restaurant if you are near by.",

My friend took advantage of one of their specials; I believe they were half off sushi rolls, and the pieces were tiny. Their gyoza was mediocre, nothing special. The one thing I did enjoy was their green tea tempura ice cream. It is probably the second best tempura ice cream dish I have had, and that speaks volumes because I LOVE tempura ice cream. The vibe in here is awesome, and we have always had great service. If you're looking for great sushi, this really isn't the place to go, but I'm still giving it three stars because the vibe, service, and tempura ice cream are excellent.",

The year before last I would frequent this restaurant on a weekly basis but, since my work place moved locations I stopped visiting. I always received great service especially by the chefs who were very accommodating in the very ingredient specific orders I would make. The food was always good but, more recently when I came in I noticed the roll I ordered lacked the flavor from previous visits. There were not as many customers as I saw in previous visits (only two couples) but, maybe it was a slow night. I often evaluate a restaurants appeal by the number of customers in there and I was a little worried about this one. Also, the music seemed to be very loud and I couldn't relay my order to the waitress during the first attempt. I will return soon and hopefully it'll be more lively in visits to come. I really like the staff and certain menu items. Overall it was and (fingers crossed) still is a good restaurant.",

When we moved, we were not fond of all you can eat concept nor five million different types of rolls to chose from.  We simply wanted good quality sushi and we are so glad that we found Kaizen.  At first, we started by ordering individual sushi pieces, but soon realized that they use the same quality sushi for all you can eat.  Also, you can get various appetizers, rolls, awesome miso soup, etc from four page filled menu.  Everyone is very friendly and their service is very quick.  We've tried five other places and this is the only place we go now.  Also, each time you get all you can eat sushi, you get a stamp and 10 will get you free all you can eat.  If you are looking for good sushi, not rolls with Mayo and cream cheese, we highly recommend this place!!",

I am obsessed with these crispy things.... yummy yummy crispy spicy tuna things.... I don't remember what they are called exactly... but try them!!!   The sushi chefs are amazing!! They are friendly, fast, funny!!!! Every time I go, I sit at the bar and they usually suggest a new roll for me to try and it's always fun!!!   The reason I cannot give them a higher than 3 is because of the waiter that is always there and we seem to always get him. I cannot judge the other support staff... they seem amazing... mostly bc they pick up his slack. We come to this establishment probably once a month, sometimes more and this young Asian guy with glasses is always there (avoid his section). The tall one with glasses is good, the shorter one not so much. Had a Dairy Queen shirt on tonight. He is so slow.... takes forever to get your drink order and bc you order your sushi through him... you might as well order it all at the beginning and make sure he writes it down correctly.... he has messed our order up every time we have gone.... and that's if we even get all of our order. God forbid there is a big game on, no matter what the sport is..... well don't depend on him and get someone else bc he will ignore you when you talk and be watching TV or stand in the corner staring at the game and only work during commercial break or half time.   This being sad I DO recommend this place bc it is really good AYCE sushi..... just try to avoid that homie!!",

Even though their posted hours say they are open and I showed up before the alleged \"last call\".   Obviously I won't try a third time. Change your hours if you're going to close early every night or refuse business because you don't feel like staying open.   Last night we walked from our house, we live close by. It was cold and started to rain. We walked in about 11:24pm and the employees working said they were closed and looked like they were on their way out the door. I told them that their hours on Yelp said they were open until midnight to which they responded that the kitchen did last call at 11:30pm, to which I responded it wasn't 11:30pm yet.   Is there a \"last call\" for the last call that I don't know about? Doesn't last call mean you need to order by 11:30pm? Not 5 minutes before?   I'm annoyed. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, and I won't be visiting your establishment again.",

Food came out 20 min apart for things such as half rolls, calamari, nigiri..pretty much everything we ordered. Oh and to top it off, the one time my friend ordered a cocktail, the server forgot about it so we had to ask about it 15 min after the order was put in.   In the very beginning servers were ensuring we were serviced, but as the meal went on, we were left with NO service. I had to flag down servers, which left me feeling like I was an annoying customer, but literally it would had been no different to dining in at mc Donald's.   To really set the night, (3 hours later) I asked one of the servers, kindly, for our check; another 10 min pass by with no check and I'm over it. So to save them a trip, my friend and I ended up walking to the podium in the front to pay. I'm so upset bc the sushi was really good but this place left me with a horrible first experience. I will definitely not be suggesting it to anyone who asks about AYCE sushi recommendations, unfortunately.",

Plus they have the option for getting them spicy without an over abundance of mayo which is huge for me, since I'm not a fan of the 'nnaise. The staff also gets 5 stars. I sat at the sushi bar as usual and everyone who came by asked if I needed anything else or was quick to fill my water glass back up. They offer half rolls too which is nice so you can get a sample of several instead of having 8 pieces of the same roll which when you're eating alone is ideal IMO. The only downside is they are on the smaller size but it's AYCE so agin I divert back to the half order and sampling more than one. I will definitely go back and you should give it a shot if you like rolls more than sushi.",

We even had to question what we ordered bc it didn't look anything like what we ordered. Literally, a rolled in housefly would have been more substantial. The waiter said that you shouldn't order rolls with crab mix, I said you should put on the menu that the roll is 95% crab. I asked for the check and felt embarrassed  I brought my fiance here. We went to Osaka down the street. It is not A.Y.C.E. But the QUALITY, service are night and day compared to Kaizen. Never again will I step foot in that place.",

The hot and cold \"tapas\" or appetizers are bland - the pork belly was overcooked and tough, the tuna poke salad was a small serving and bland, and the salad my wife ordered had no dressing.  I do like the sushi rolls and the variety - we have tried various different rolls and they taste fresh.  However, the service is awful.  They are understaffed and when you try and catch a waiter/waitress as they run by your table to the kitchen or to another table, they stop and look at you as if they are doing you a service.  One thing I asked for (a fork, not that difficult) last night never arrived.  The other thing is be prepared to be there a long time.  Last night it took 40 minutes before one of our rolls arrived.  Each of the other two times we were there over an hour and our sushi took forever to arrive.    There are too many other good AYCE sushi restaurants in Las Vegas to go here and be frustrated with the service.",

The staff remembers you and are soooo friendly!! So attentive! They have very fresh fish with some really great hot food too. Specials are always great and so generous with their AYCE menu. Consistently amazing. We go every other Thursday now as a work thing, even though I live in spring valley now. It's worth it. It's that good.",

Who doesn't love free sake?! - Salmon nigiri was delicious. Salmon portion was large and melted in your mouth  Cons: - Every other nigiri we ordered besides Salmon was dry and did not seem the least bit fresh. There were some nigiri pieces that literally looked so dry I was hesitant to taste - Once the restaurant got busy, our server barely came by our table to take our order/check up on us  - We ordered 2 dishes of cooked fish (I think a mackerel and yellowtail collar) which didn't come out 40+ min after we asked for it. We cancelled our order and both still came out  If I can give one piece of advice, it's to go elsewhere for AYCE, especially if you're big on nigiri. Fish is not fresh here.",

The staff is another reason to choose Kaizen. Jay Kim and his staff have always worked hard while remaining polite, courteous, friendly and fun. It's apparent that others have chosen Kaizen as there designated sushi stop. Guests who walk in always appear excited upon their greeting.",

The previous AYCE sushi places I have dined at have used mediocre fish quality and gigantic rice balls.  What I like about Kaizen was the fish was fresh, nice quality and that the rice was a great size for sushi.  Keep in mind that high end fish such as oh-toro you are only allowed one order and that the one order is consistent of only 1 piece.  It would be nice if that was noted on the menu.  However, that is really the worst I can say.  We ordered a ton...  garlic edamame (spice but very tasty), Hamachi Sashimi with the Jalapeno's was delicious, various nigiri sushi was great, Hawaiian roll and the baked Scallop Volcano role were both very good!  I currently live on the other side of town but I would totally make the drive to come back and have AYCE sushi at Kaizen!    The food here is amazing the only reason I didn't give the 5th star was due to the wait staff.  A few were nice and a few could stand to be a bit more friendly.",

The service was good that's why I'm giving it 2 stars not 1. The quality of the fish was sort of chunky, previously frozen for a decade, and not fresh at all.

FOOD: beef tataki - not the greatest, more cooked than i would like.  shrimp tempura - 2 dinky piece ---i could do without. no flavor really. it was crunchy. the dipping sauce was bland. seafood pancake - I had a small bit of this. it tasted burnt to me. Idk miso soup - lots of flavor. I really liked this. plenty of seaweed in it also Soft Shell Crab appetizer - it has mustard on it. i did not like. but my friend really enjoyed it. i was supposed to have sweet potato in it. I didn't taste it though. maybe it was just the bite i got.  sushi: it was decent. fish wasn't the frsh Salmon  - 3 orders --- i love salmon so it hit the spot Halibut - 3 orders  ---super fishy. i was not impressed Ono - 2 orders --- def love a place that has this fish. nice and buttery. Salmon Skin Hand Roll --- there was skin all the way to the bottom. A-OK! would have scarfed down more of this if i ordered less of the sushi Albacore Sashimi - 2 piece --- the onion crisp on it was a nice touch. it was perfectly seared. yummy. i say order it!  Tempura Ice Cream -- cannot go wrong with this. it hit the spot. but the tempura batter. i really dont know what it is but it was not as good as it could be. probably just used a plain tempura batter. other places i know add some sweetness to the batter.   Will i come back? probably. would i suggest to go here. not really. It wasn't amazing. I definitely have had better AYCE sushi places. My friend i was with really likes this spot.

The nigiri,  the rolls, the hand rolls.  It had no fresh flavor and all the rolls tasted the same and were very mushy.  The servers were very friendly and pleasant,  however getting the food we ordered was a challenge and took too long. In fact there was one item we never got even though we asked several times.

Their nigiri is amazing, and their rolls have hit spot on.  Not too many sauces (like those restaurants up and down Eastern...not naming names), and they don't have rolls that are called \"tastes like my ex-wife (or maybe girlfriend)\" which always leave me with a bad taste in my mouth (haha...puns are funny).  The Kiss of Fire roll is my fav.  Staff is attentive, chef's are friendly, and the atmosphere is modern and clean.",

Ambiance of the place is great, the staff is friendly and the place is clean! 3 things I look for when I walk into a restaurant.  Their all you can eat menu you selection was bizarre ! I love how there was so much sushi selections and non sushi entrees you can choose from.  I pretty much devoured the Nigiri  , since i was on a so called diet and Nigiri only has two pieces rather than an entire roll. I must say the Nigiri was to die for. Temperature was great and the texture was perfect. The Nigiri had no veins, it was all fish. :)  As for their non sushi items , they had of course the common Gyoza, Skewers, MIso Soup and I love their Ahi Poke salad ( I highly recommend you order this). And if you love mussels their mussels are fresh has they can be.  We ended our dinner by ordering a red bean ice cream and of course a strawberry mocha.

Unique and delicious) Rattle Snake ( if you like sweet eel this one is the bomb) ... I never knew they had desert sushi other than Sweet Egg, but try their Ice Cream in My Mouth, lol... It's banana tempura wrapped in rice and topped with cooked strawberries in a sweet sauce... It's unique and ask for a rose on it for your special someone if you're on a date... Lol it was a surprise :-)  Also be prepared for some crazy trendy music video experience.",

My favorite rolls are the Sunrise and Monster, sooo good and baked mussels are a must have! The only thing that I didn't really like was the green tea ice cream, kinda had a weird taste. But the service has always extremely quick the few times I've been here and all the servers are very polite and kind. Will continue to come back :)",

Our waitress was very attentive, helpful and super pleasant. She went above and beyond. I was there with my friend and when we asked for the check we didn't even have to ask for separate checks. She already knew... And brought two separate checks. Now that's impressive!  I will definitely be back here. With so many sushi restaurants in the valley, Kaizen definitely stands out from the crowd!",

    "text": "I've been coming here for many years and I assure you, Kaizen is the BEST PLACE IN VEGAS FOR AYCE SUSHI.   The quality of food here is actually too good to be True, and too good to be AYCE. The thick cuts and perfect fish-to-rice ratio are on point. Their menus, from appetizers to desserts, are many, fun, and well-made.  *TIP 1: GET THE STAMP CARD! 11th visit is free.  **TIP 2: Check out the Catch of the Day menu for daily specials! (Included with AYCE)  Would highly recommend the skewers, oysters, and clam miso soup for appetizers. Super white tuna, salmon, and sweet shrimp are always safe bets. ALL, every single one, of the desserts are worth a try. They will have GREEN TEA CHEESECAKE at times and you will have to get it (please).  Bottom line: Their quality of food has been consistently great for years and across the week, the ambience of the place is amazing for any occasion, and the servers and the owner are very friendly. Kaizen deserves all the attention it gets.",

Only reason I gave 3 stars is because there was this employee sitting next to us, staring at us, listening to our conversation the whole time we were eating there. I don't mind employee sitting next to us taking break/meal break. I've worked at a restaurant before. But staring and listening for entire time we were there? I don't think she was taking her break or anything, because she was sitting there more than a hour. We felt really uncomfortable. Everyone in our group felt that. Everytime I turned around, I made eye contacts with her. How awkward is that? I would go back for food. But I'll probably ask different sitting.",

Fairly busy on a Tuesday, I got a table for 3 immediately and started ordering without my friends because- hungry.   They have the typical shrimp tempura, poke salad, and other starters, but also have shrimp shumai which I've noticed is kind of rare, in addition to fried rice, and a handful of sashimi selections which was a perfect start to the meal.   All of the rolls we ordered were solid and I like that they have the option of doing half rolls. The avocado lover was my favorite and we ordered it twice. The only thing keeping this from being a 5 start review was the fact that we found a hair in our food. I honestly don't mind when this happens, just take the plate away and call it a day- it's not the end of the world. Still kind of gross, but it didn't ruin our sushi date!! Definitely order the cheesecake tempura and all the mochi you'd like!!",

The appetizers included in the AYCE menu was amazing. The sushi was one of the better tasting sushi we've had in the Henderson area. Overall we were pleased with our dining experience.

Let me start with I got food poisoning and spent a couple of hours in the middle of the night  expunging everything I had for dinner here. Can pretty much end it right there.  However, to be fair let me share some positives. The service was very attentive and prompt. The portions were reasonably sized. The menu is large and there are only a couple of things that you cannot get on the all you can eat option. You can truly eat all you want, they come back often and you have 90 minutes to pack it in.  As far as other negatives, the fresh water eel had a bad smell to it. Should have stopped right there but I (stupidly) felt compelled to eat it since I was at an all you can eat joint. Definitely should have sent it back. The Avocado Train roll had avocado with a bunch of rotten spots in it. I did my best to pick them out but if I am a sushi chef I would think I would spot that and do some quality control. Finally when trying to use the bathroom you go into the back. I never got in the bathroom as it was in use but it smelled nasty and the area was not that clean. Another red flag.  While I am cognizant of not wanting to hurt anyone's livelihood I highly recommend that you do NOT eat here. That was the sickest I have been in some time.",

It was so amazing that her brother that doesn't like anything was out of his chair and in her plate!  So fussy kids just may surprise you here!  Now as for the AYCE my daughter ordered a crunchy salmon roll early in and we never received it.  I have no idea why?   They just kept saying yes but never brought it?   But how can I complain when every roll that did arrive was on point.  We were very brave and had a fun time trying oysters for the first time.

    "text": "I've heard A LOT of hype surrounding Kaizen as of late, so I wanted to see if making the long drive out to the Southeast part of town was worth it.   Supposedly the Southeast location is the only one with AYCE, but I can't confirm this 100%, so I'd call ahead of time if you're planing on dining at their other location.   Kaizen's space is about average for a sushi place, so if you're visiting during peak hours, be prepared to wait. I went right before dinner time, and got seated immediately.   Oyshi or Goyemon have been my go-tos for some time, but Kaizen is different. There's something about the quality of the food Kaizen serves that's a cut above the competition, although I can't put my finger on it; everything just tastes better. I typically order the same rolls, and expand into a few new ones, and this is probably some of the best sushi I've ever had!   The AYCE menu is also quite vast! Kaizen isn't too limiting on what you can or can't have, which added to a more positive experience! Speaking of which, the staff was incredible! Very attentive, picked up plates before they formed a mountain, and not once did I have to ask for a refill!   It may be an excursion, but if you're willing to make the drive, Kaizen is definitely worth it! I don't get sushi often, but from now on, Kaizen is my #1!",

    "text": "Kaizen Fusion can satisfy any AYCE sushi lover!! They offer the most diversity of sushi types ranging from small plates, sashimi, and special & fried rolls. For the AYCE options these guys provide a lots to choose from, unlike other places where they only give you certain part of the menu.  I came in a few times for dinner and this place gets packed, luckily for two people waiting time isn't long. I can just tell you from the stuff I've ordered was pretty darn delicious!! Most notable: Philadelphia Roll, Mexican Fiesta Roll, Japanese Lasagna, and the Avocado Train.   So I what did I only give 3 stars, specifically 3.5, it's the service.   On occasion in between meals, it didn't matter how simple or complex, some items came quick others came slow. I wish there was a set of reasonable expectation so at the end of night, I wouldn't feel confused whether I got the most of what I paid for.   I would still recommend Kaizen just for the sushi, if you an avoid this pitfall.",

I waited 30 min for my BBQ roll, but the chef didn't even started making my food, other customer ordered a lot but they got their food. And when the owner tell the chef to make my food, he said something like Fk, S***. U didn't make my food, and u say something like this?? Do not come here.",

I went for all you can eat so I could have variety.   My favorite is the super white tuna.  They redeemed themselves!  It tasted clean and fresh.  The delicious lemony acidic sauce they serve on the regular menu.  All the raw fish I ordered was great!  My boyfriend said he didn't recognize the chef and he must be new, perhaps this change is the improvement in the quality they are serving.   Our server seemed to be in a bad mood.  Must have been an off day for him.  Also we were the last guests for the evening.   He did make a great suggestion for the ribeye.  It was tasty and the veggies were cooked just right.  I wasn't able to fill my stomach.  We arrived before closing time.     Hope this quality remains consistent.  I'd like to arrive earlier next time to try everything else.",

The one thing I notice about Vegas sushi bars is not everyone serves good quality fish.  (Yes I know...we're in the middle of the desert.). There are a handful that do and I'd rather point you to that direction than come here.  I'm just disappointed that I've come across yet another Japanese sushi restaurant that was a total fail.    The \"All you can eat\" option is $27 for dinner.  And there were some limitations on how much you can order for certain types of fish.  Understandable, due to it's market pricing but still defeats the purpose of an \"all you can eat\" menu.    Overall, not a great experience for sushi/Japanese food.  It was ok for me and I most likely would not return.  Sorry Kaizen better luck next time!",

Ps:I used to come here for dinning with my friends, and I really highly recommend this spot to them before we came. Now I got so many negative feedback from my friends, for you all guys, I saw you just got a return order N turned back to serve the order to another table. That's why I said that words, you can't fool your customers like that way even at night, cuz we always know what you do for us, how much you cared about customers.  DON'T DO THE SAME THING TO ANOTHER CUSTOMER, IT'S SO RUDE N INSANITARY!",

Why would that be proper? Sanitary? The price for that was an over priced $9.95. The third order was corrected and no apologies or explanation for the  screw up.. I had a horrible experience and won't ever opt to order from them again. So congrats you've managed to lose a potential 85 customers.

I say ok since they mention sushimon and I never went there before. But I heard good things about it. Half way coming down from the freeway they call me up and says, hey change of plan, we going to kaizen instead. Sushimon is packed to the bone, 50 minutes wait, I aint gonna wait 50 minutes for sushi.  So we roll into kaizen and its absolutely spot on. Granted I was skeptical at first cos I never heard about this place before, but I guess my friends made a great choice. We were there for good 2 hours just eating and conversing, sake and beers later, the waitress still very nice to my stupid friend who keep asking her out. Good experience. Great sushi, and absolutely must try.",

P.S While we were eating I decided to yelp the place ( wish I did That before we went) and found out it was on ch13 dirty dinning. Hope I don't get the explosive runs",

If you are looking for a place to drink Budweiser with your 'all you can eat' sushi...this is the spot for you. I was not impressed. I found the service slow and uninviting. We sat at the bar, none of the chefs interacted with us, which I found particular strange being one of three couples in the entire restaurant. When I asked to order one of their specialty rolls, the chef turned to the hostess and said 'they want to order'. Apparently there is a chain of command in the order placement system at 'KAIZEN FUSION ROLL & SUSHI'. I would suggest a sign or explanation for future guests to prevent these or other etiquette blunders. Food was compellingly average.",

The one thing I will commend is one of the rolls the waitress recommended was the silver state roll. Now that would be the only reason I would go back...but if you're looking for fresh fish nigiri style Go to Sushi Koma!",

She is so friendly and attentive and always has a smile on her. For 26 bucks you can't beat that value, ambience and service. It's a place where all the working class locals go and there is never and riffraff in this place. be sure to check their daily catch of the day and specials. Garlic tuna is superb.",

We waited for over 20 minutes while I saw our food brought out by the bar just sitting there. Our waiter was on the other side of the restaurant the entire time. We had to ask someone else to get him. He asked if we wanted to order something else. I told him we were still waiting for our first order. He said sorry. Then proceeded to grab the food that had been sitting there for 20 min and said oh here you go. I told him it was unacceptable and he complained that his staff called out and just kept giving excuses. I told him that I was extremely unhappy with the service and would never pay for this. He then said okay then get up and leave. Ridiculous. Would never go here again. Sushi didn't even taste that fresh.",

I enjoyed the service & how upbeat they were even before the time they were closing. Hipster atmosphere, with televisions playing popular mainstream music videos. I'm always a fan of a restaurant having a theme to the environment, & Kaizen was very tastefully decorated.   I stuck with the simple spicy tuna roll & my girlfriends ordered some creative, unique rolls (all to which I unfortunately forgot their names, but not the taste!) Most of their dishes are garnished with bold flavors, sauces, & seasonings to give it a kick, so if you're a fan of adding a little taste to your sushi, Kaizen will probably work out for you wonderfully!   Prices are at what a decent sushi restaurant should be at, & would definitely recommend this location to anyone taking the spouse on a date or looking to go on a classy sushi lunch/dinner with their friends!",

We sat at the sushi bar and found the sushi chefs to be polite and fun. Beef tataki was on special, but it was just *eh*. I found it odd that they sold yellowtail belly specifically as a markup, but I can say it was delicious! Fresh and tasty. We tried a few rolls of the menu and found them all to be big, sloppy, and saucy. I do prefer my rolls tight and neat and I do like tasting fish. Maybe we ordered the wrong thing but I feel like every roll was just a mess on my plate covered in way too much sauce.   They are open late and they have fresh yellowtail - I will be back, but only when I can't get to En and I'll avoid the sloppy rolls next time.",

    "text": "I had always loved Kaizen for the quality of the sushi they serve. So fresh and authentic, you feel like you're swimming in the oceans with them. But my only issue was that they were never AYCE, until they finally did the unthinkable.  Kaizen has very a very moden type of decor and appearance with multiple TVs and even a projector screen that plays random music videos. It's hardly packed when I go so the environment is acceptable and comfortable.  Kaizen has always served the best rolls and sushi in town. You can say all you want about Goyemon and what not but I personally don't think  you can compare the two. My BELOVED roll is the sexy roll. The food itself defines its title in every way whether it be from taste to looks. The spicy tuna was thicker than the rice and the sauce that it was pressed on had my tongue slobbering. And as you order more and more, the chefs put less rice and sushi on your rolls so that they can be easy on us too! There's also a salad bar for all the AYCE customers! It consists of seaweed salad, other typical salads, cucumbers, and etc.   AYCE is about $27.95. It's a fraction more than the average but you are paying more for better quality. Otherwise, all the rolls are practically the same in terms of pricing.  Service is great! Although there was only one server, he was on top of everything all the time.   I'm sorry Mon, Goyemon, and Yama, but there's a new sheriff in town. Everyone should give this place a try.",

Kaizen has been promoted to my #1 sushi spot because what makes a sushi spot golden for me is their selection of rolls (check!) and their appetizers (check!) and their service (check!)  I hope they don't ever get rid of the salad bar.  It makes me feel like I'm being healthy eating there. I love that the server kept giving us jugs and jugs and endless bottomless glasses of Iced Green Tea - a service many other places fail to do. I am so thankful for a Kaizen on my side of town so we don't have to go very far when we go home so full, so we can just plop on the couch with a smile on our faces and talk about when we can visit next, not too soon, but not too far, but maybe like once a month would be perfect.  And also, I am especially grateful that their rolls are bite sized, not like monster size, so that we can fit it in our mouths without having it be puffy full and we don't have to cover it with a napkin because other places make their rolls HUGE.  and its even an added bonus that we can order any rolls half order so we can try more yummy rolls that  they make.    My only complaint - the music, well one song really.   please stop playing what it is that's playing Gangnam Style (both guy and girl version) because I lose my appetite for a moment because i absolutely for the life of me I cannot stand that song.",

The one thing I am griping about is the owner/manager allowed a customer to bring in a good size pit bull like puppy. If this establishment is willing to violate one health code, what other health code violations take place on the premises.  I can understand if the puppy is a legitimate service dog or seeing eye dog.  This puppy was neither.  I am not going back to this place knowing their disregard for the public health code.

Me and my boyfriend was looking to dinein at the sushi place near our place so I thought I'd give them another shot. We ordered few nigiris. I am not kidding- the quality of all of fish was below average. I was very disappointed. We also ordered uni nigiri and when servers brought them to us I noticed they were all not in good condition. I mean you literally can tell if you eat them you will get sick. That's how bad they were. We were upset and talked to our server how bad they are and she was like \"Yes, I know they are not that great.\" We were like wtf????? I mean like would you eat them? You basically serving low quality fish knowing that they are in bad condition. I lost for words. So we returned them back, of course. And also, we ordered few other items but she did not even bring them to us and did not check up on us either. We wanted to complain about it but thought we'd better not cause we won't be returning. Appetizers were okay so there goes 2 stars. Bad service, low quality food and expensive. Sorry Kaizen sushi",

My expectations coming in were low and the reality was no better.  $26 for AYCE dinner. We got two rolls, which were incredibly bland. Rather than fill up on more blah rolls, we ordered quite a few appetizers and nigiri to make up for it. Some of their selections on AYCE are one order per person, which is pretty normal, but in the case of the nigiri (which is usually at least two pieces), they will just give you a single sliver of whatever it is, like with the fatty tuna. So not much of a chance to experience it. Most of the nigiri was pretty decent, but the squid was tough and almost slimy! It took a serious effort of will to get it down and I usually like squid. The texture has been haunting me all day the following day.  The service was a little impersonal, but quick and polite enough. There are a dozen sushi places up and down the few miles of Eastern stretching from the 215 to Anthem. Most of them are mediocre at best and I include Kaizen in that. I don't know how they all stay open. With 2 AYCE dinners, plus one large beer, and a $12 tip, our tab was just under $80. $80 for a blah meal just isn't going to cut it, so the search for a good sushi joint continues.",

    "text": "Last night was my first and last experience at Kaizen sushi. We came to the restaurant at 530 with a party of 9. They informed us that it would be a 15-20 minuet wait. The waiting area for this restaurant is very small, but yet so is the restaurant. After about thirty minutes, I asked how much longer and they told me 15-20 minuets again. By this point I was a little irritated. We could have gone to another establishment by this point. After another 15 minuets all we saw open were random tables of 4 and everyone after us kept on being seated. Half of our party left and went to Buffalo Wild Wings because they were starving. So me and my friend stayed with our daughters. When they seated us at a 4 top table someone came and took our drink order. I immediately asked for edamame because we were so hungry and she told us \"I'll go get your server\" when our server arrived he wasn't even looking at us while we ordered, he was so distracted by how busy it was. I place an order for two rolls, a chicken bowl, and a side of whole rice. When the food came out 20 minuets later, he forgot the side of rice for our little one. I didn't see him again for about another 15 minuets. We had a spicy tuna roll and both of us didn't get refills on our water until I finally flagged someone down. We then wanted a specialty roll and ordered it. About about ten minuets we were so over it we asked for the check. The server couldn't have gotten us out of there fast enough. When the check arrived our special roll wasn't on there. I asked \"did you take it off or forget to put it on?\" He told is he forgot to ring it up. We were literally sitting there waiting for a roll that would have never came! To apologize he handed us two GIANT bags of fruit snacks right in front our our kids without asking us! This experience was a joke. The sushi rolls weren't that great. The restaurant is tiny! I wouldn't go there with more than 4 people ever. The service was terrible. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. I have nothing good to say about this place at all.",

    "text": "I only have one experience with this restaurant and unfortunately I never even received my food, so this one-star rating is solely based on customer service (or complete lack thereof). I recently had surgery that has left me homebound, so delivery food is my only current option. I stumbled upon Kaizen on Postmates, and was very excited to satiate my sushi craving- the prices were reasonable and the delivery fee was reasonable. I placed a large order and settled into excited anticipation for my delivery. 10 minutes before it was to be delivered, I received an email from Postmates that my order had been cancelled, with no further explanation. I immediately called the restaurant to inquire whether they knew the cause of the cancellation- they were unsure, although they had called the Postmates driver to ask about a specific item preparation and suggested the driver call me to verify. I assume (because I never received a call) that the driver just cancelled my order instead. Unfortunately, 90% of the order had already been made, and Wade (who answered the phone at Kaizen) became accusatory, suggesting that the cancellation was my fault, insisting I replace the order immediately for future delivery- I was trying to explain that I didn't think placing a new order and waiting for another driver would fit into my timeline for the day- but was unable to fully communicate this, as Wade was impatiently interrupting me at every thought. I am extremely disappointed to have been treated that way as a customer, and know for certain they will never again receive my business. Shame on you, Kaizen.",

    "text": "Can someone please tell me why it's always deserted when my boyfriend and I come here? This place is great. Kaizen is one of the best sushi places in this area, without having to wait forever to be seated.   Food:  Nigiri: Let me just tell you, my boyfriend and I are huge on nigiri. 85% of what we order is nigiri. The fish here seems fresh. No weird fishy tastes going on here. It's all good, clean fish. I love ordering salmon nigiri, it's my favorite. Another thing that I enjoy from here is their super white tuna. I'll be honest with you, every other place that I've has super white tuna, I was not impressed. That all changed when I had it at Kaizen. Seriously, try it. It's the best super white that I've had so far. Oh and their Amaebi (Sweet Shrimp) is great. Good size, great taste. Did I mention they serve the fried heads with it? :D yum.   Rolls: There are a wide variety of rolls to choose from. I make it a point to order at least one when I get AYCE. Though I haven't had a lot of the menu, I can tell you they have something for everyone. My boyfriend always orders half of the Monster Roll, which is huge by the way.  There is a roll that I didn't particularly like, and it was the Something Spicy Roll. It was basically a rice heavy spicy salmon roll, covered in Siracha. Not very good.  Dessert: Great place to go if you have a sweet tooth. Along with the normal stuff, like mochi and tempura ice cream, they also have things like tepura cheesecake, green tea creme brulee, and other yummy sweets. Don't forget to save some room for dessert!  Service:  The service is quite nice. The waiters and waitresses aren't the typical talkative, bubbly type, but they are very polite and attentive, which is fine by me. Based on the one experience I've had here with a large party, I don't think they are used to serving large parties. The server was still polite, but they seemed a bit overwhelmed by the amount of orders coming in at one time.  Overall, please try this place out! It's hardly ever busy when I come, and I'd love to see this place get more business.",

The funny thing is, I am one of their most regular customers and am told that by the staff frequently. They also know I order from bitesquad no less than 20times per month.

    "text": "3/10 would not recommend :(  Quick synopsis: Service was okay, not the best & I was not living at all for the sushi  The menu was a million pages long (not really, but there were lots of options). Although this may seem good, I think it really put this restaurant on edge as it made it harder for them to focus on making good quality dishes rather than a multitude of below subpar foods.  First off, the service was quite standard despite the fact that we had about four different servers that night. The first server my table had came off very kindhearted and respectful until we placed our orders. We had AYCE; therefore, we decided to purchase a lot of food in order to get our money's worth. While ordering, it seemed that she made a face full of disgust and disrespect at the fact that we had ordered so much.  For whatever reason, our first server decided to stop serving us. We were treated with another server who was evidently our savior. She was the nicest, most complimenting waitress anyone could ever ask for. She always came around to ask if we needed anything and never forgot to come back if we had any issues. Honestly, she is one of the reasons that I'm giving this restaurant a chance. In contrast to this saving light that guided us through the darkness of this restaurant, the clean up crew was not up to my standards. These individuals would always come up out of nowhere to grab our plates--the worst part is that they would surprisingly grab them from in between our party rather than from the open end of the table. Moreover, it was clear that they were rushing us as they constantly came over and watched for the moment we would take the last piece of sushi off the plates. Like a scavenging group of vultures, they had only made our eating experience very intimidating and unprofessional.  Now onto the more important issue, the actual sushi. Yes, yes, yes, the appetizers and what not were fine and were comparable to other sushi restaurants we've been to around town. But then again, I could be wrong, since we had only ordered two different starter items--this being the short ribs and the cucumber salads.  The maki rolls were not that tasty and the nigiri was off the charts trash, and I'm not (I repeat not) over exaggerating.  I'll start off with the nigiri because that's what I'm always looking forward too whenever I go to a sushi bar. The fish was not fresh. I had only gotten the toro, cajun albacore, and uni. I was hoping to order more, by my stomach told me otherwise. Whatever I was served was NOT TORO. That fatty, melty component that toro is known for was not there. To my assessment, it was just a chewy piece of old, fishy tuna. To make the eating experience even worst, both the questionable \"toro\" and the Cajun albacore were seemingly frozen and recently thawed to an extent that made it very noticeable. The uni looked fresh, but you know what they say--looks can be deceiving. That sea urchin was absolutely foul. The nigiri was overall not up to my expectations and im actually shook while im still writing this. Although it was quite nasty, I had to finish it knowing that I would be charged if I didn't consume all of it.  Now the maki sushi rolls were better. The cooked/baked rolls were tasty, but that may have been because the rolls had all consisted of shrimp tempura, imitation crab, soft shell crab, and other veggies. On the contrary, the rolls with raw fish was below subpar and not fresh. I think it was only edible because of the magnitude of sauces that were doused on each of these rolls. To that extent, they were able to mask the fish's uncanny flavor with the mass amounts of eel sauce, spicy mayo, etc.  The last round of what seemed to be a dreadful dinner was the impending dessert. Oh how excited I was to get something sweet. We had ordered the green tea ice cream, the mini honey toast, and the vanilla creme brulee. The green tea ice cream was delicious and comparable to many of the ones found at other sushi bars. The honey toast was just a little toasted dinner roll topped with some honey and vanilla ice cream. To say the least, that honey toast didn't reach my expectations, but it was still good. Now, I had ordered the vanilla creme brulee. Looking at it, it had a nice encrusted sugar topping. As I raised my spoon towards my mouth, I noticed that my dessert was not warm like regular creme brulee. It was cold, almost like how my heart feels as I'm writing this disheartening review. Overall, the dessert was still delicious and palatable.  Although it could have just been a bad day, I don't think I could risk going back to sushi restaurant that sells bad fish. But if you still disagree with me, I hope you can try this restaurant yourself and tell me otherwise. I was very optimistic about this place seeing these great reviews, but on the other end I finished unsatisfied.  PS I added some metaphors and small jokes to add levity, but besides that, please take everything I'm writing into consideration",

I wish I could give this place more than 5 stars.   I will continue to update this post every time I eat at Kaizen. Hope you all enjoy.  12/29/15 This is my fifth trip to Kaizen and every time is fantastic. The sushi is fresh, the different types of rolls are wonderful. The service is outstanding. I never had to wait to have my drink refilled or to wait to get the sushi rolls. Even when the place is really busy, the service is outstanding. If you have a chance to go, I would recommend the AYCE to try the many different rolls they have to offer. If your not in the mood for AYCE, then I recommend there Bento Box.",

    "text": "Umm Yeah! Kaizen on Paradise Road is by far my favorite sushi restaurant of all time, so I knew this wouldn't let us down. SUPER big points for the AYCE Menu! Paradise doesn't offer that, and this location is in Henderson! YAY!  I posted a picture with my check in, we ordered Baked green mussels, oysters on the half shell, fatty tuna, yellow tail, yum yum scallop nigiri, & my favorite, ikura.. to start. Everything was perfect. I love when a good AYCE offers oysters on the half. They limit it to one order per person-- that's understandable... because I would order 50 =-)   We like spicy food, so if you do I HIGHLY recommend the Salmon Killer, and the kiss of fire rolls. For those that aren't a fan of fire, Try the O roll, snow white, their Hawaiian roll. They will add or remove any ingredients you request. Personally, I'm not a fan of asparagus in sushi, so they substituted it in of the rolls for Japanese pickled veggies.   The perks of this restaurant is that there's no rules to their AYCE. They let you swap sauces, customize rolls and order half rolls. I think my sushi dream has come True.   The service was nice, our waitress was friendly and told us we can order however we want as long as we don't waste food (No worries there!)   The fish, just like their other location, is uberly fresh. The AYCE price is $24 after 9PM, on Fridays & Saturdays you get either a FREE sake or beer per AYCE order.   Happy Sushi-ing =-)",

    "text": "To all my fellow yelps check in here and get a complimentary small hot saki or a pint of draft beer. This is one of the best all you can eat sushi places I've been too. The entire menu (minus the sashimi section) is free game for all you can eat.   The sushi is pretty good quality. They have an amazing selection of various sushi rolls, appetizers and other Asian cuisines.   The menu is the most helpful menu I've ever laid eyes on. Each sushi roll is listed with what is inside, on top and the sauces over them. This makes it easier to order food that you like confidentiality.   The service was impeccable. Our waitress was extremely helpful and nice. If it was based on service alone they would get 5 stars!   The layout and atmosphere of this establishment is very modern. They have music videos playing so it tends to get a little noisy at times. I wouldn't suggest going here on a first date or if you're planning anything intimate.   Usually this smaller restaurant fills up quick so expect to wait for a table. However this isn't the case all the time.  They also deliver with bite squad and gave every customer a $5 off coupon.   Tip: If you're getting the all you can eat get the half orders (4 pieces) so you can try a wider variety of items. Also, the green stuff they give you isn't guacamole! Haha.",

Their service is outstanding when they aren't too busy and they are always friendly. They are not stingy at all with their cuts for nigiri, and their fusion rolls are so delicious. The food is just always so delicious!! Many other restaurants limit you to one dessert option on the AYCE menu but Kaizen does not. If you want to be able to eat like you have two stomachs and still be treated kindly by the staff Kaizen is the place for you!",

I have nothing to say but maybe stick to everything cooked, if that's what you like to order at Japanese establishments. I refuse to come back unless my sister tells me otherwise.

They have a good variety of hot and cold appetizers like soft-shell crab, tako yaki, and raw oysters.  They have all the basic nigiri like salmon, ikura, hamachi, and ahi; and also creative rolls with various fillers, like California or shrimp tempura inside and different toppings like spicy ahi, unagi, and sauces on top the rolls.  The All You Can Eat is a good value as the Ala Carte plates can add up quickly.  The interior is modern and pretty, and for better or worse has TVs throughout the dinning room showing sports and playing music videos.  Take your time (you get 1.5 hours for the All You Can Eat), enjoy the company, and eat a lot of pretty decent sushi for an affordable price.",

We only ordered 2 rolls and 6 piece sashimi. Seriously? The sushi chef forgot our order. We didn't get our rolls until he was reminded 40 min later. What kind of business model is this. It's not really all you can eat when you order a few items and they take that long to get it to you. I would avoid this place like the plague. So disappointed on how they handle service and food was ok. It seems like they do it on purpose so you can't order. The menu clearly states you only have an hour and half to order food. Hmmmm that just doesn't seem right. Does it?",

    "text": "There are so many different sushi places across Las Vegas and Henderson. If you were ask someone for their recommendation on which is the best, you are very likely to get a different answer from everyone. The answer to that question for me at least, is Kaizen. I have been to this place more times than I can even remember.   Like many sushi restaurants, they offer all you can eat (AYCE for all of my sushi peeps). Not only does that include dozens of various sushi rolls, but it also includes small entree portions as well as traditional Asian dishes. Let me not forget about the desserts that are all included. I also try to save room for mochi and quite frankly, order it even when I have hit my wall.   I begin my order the same way every time; spicy tuna roll. If I'm being honest, I could eat only spicy tuna rolls the whole time but the menu is so deep and unique, that I wouldn't dare. They go real unique with the names like the pictured \"I love my ass\" roll. It feels a little silly at first calling out some of the names, but you get used to it. They have several desert rolls like the \"Banana\" and \"Ice Cream in Your Mouth\". So many different options with different types of fish. Everyone can find something that the would like.  Another cool thing they have is a punch card reward program. Buy 10 meals and get on free. If you are in the mood for sushi, I would highly recommend walking into this place. Just be prepared to be rolled out.",

It's near Buffalo Wild Wings, but down on the other end of the parking lot, so you can find parking easier (BWW is always full).  The restaurant is a nice size. We are always greeted right when we walk in.   AYCE as the best value for your money. We like to start with edemamme. Have had both the salted, and the garlic. The garlic has a ton of garlic on it. Almost too much. But, still tasty. We then like to order nigiri, and various rolls.   They have a banana roll, and an ice cream in your mouth roll! Both very unique, as I don't believe I have seen many fruit rolls at other establishments.   The service is a little slow, and I get asked the same question by different people a lot. One specific server in particular I don't prefer over the others, as she makes me feel very rushed.  I like the Japanese music videos playing on the tvs. Adds a nice touch.   The deep fried ice cream is a must!",

    "text": "This place is kind of a joke. Idk what happened since the last time I was here (cuz I really liked the food) but, the description and photos of a lot of their menu items do not match what came out to us.   Example:   Shrimp tempura - basic right!??! Nope, we got the smallest of shrimps that was tempura'd. Not sure if it was baby shrimp but, it was the smallest. Possible frozen to account for how small it was ...size reminded me of the ones they put in Chinese soups aka small ass baby shrimp.   I WISH I took a photo of how ridiculous it was.   Honey toast - literally bread topped with ice cream. Not the usual loaf of bread with a scooped out middle filled with ice cream.  My friends and I laughed.   It was a sad quick fix of a sushi night. Basically the only sushi spot open after 10pm in Anthem area so, now we know to make that drive to Goyemon for good AYCE sushi lol",

Must come and check it   *Been back a few times. Place is still always packed but my experiences have been really going down. Had dinner tonight and I feel I may start looking for a new place unfortunately. Food quality seems to be going down.  Had the tuna salad, very strong unpleasant taste and odor. Also ordered a roll (double hamachi?), it was so sauced or watered down, they were deflated by the time it came to the table. Couldn't even eat it with chop sticks with it completely falling apart. Service? Forget it! Lucky if you have 5 seconds of the waiters attention. Took 20 min to pay our bill. Glad they are doing well but it may be my last time eating here.",

Waitress recommended to try their \"orange blossom\" and \"sex bomb\" rolls - they were actually very good ! They do half rolls here too which is always a plus. Salmon & salmon belly nigiri were delicious. Toro & uni nigiri were actually decent for being an AYCE place. Only thing I wish that was better  is their fish-to-rice ratio but at least the sushi tasted fresh.  Sashimi is limited to 3 orders per person I believe but it's more than enough so you have room for other things. I highly recommend their salmon sashimi as well as their yellowtail sashimi.  Other menu items I've enjoyed were their beef tataki (1 order per person) and soft shell crab. Unlimited dessert (honey toast , tiramisu , tempura cheesecake and your standard mochi & tempura ice cream are all available here). Only dessert that is not unlimited is the creme brulee which comes in green tea or vanilla.  Appreciated good customer service from all the waitresses here. Prices are 23$ lunch (til 4 pm) & 28$ dinner. Make sure to get their stamp card (11th one is free).",

We dropped by on a Saturday evening to try them out. I was expecting to wait since it was Saturday night,. They were bustling, but we were seated quickly, so that was a plus.  The service is prompt, friendly and competent. The ambiance is a little rough, but okay. Ultimately, it's clean ... enough.  The real plus to dining here is the variety of food included in the AYCE. It is wide and varied from sushi, to grilled, to skewers and plenty of rolls to choose from.  One negative aspect we experienced was receiving a piece of tuna that was clearly not \"Toro\". Unfortunately, plenty of AYCE sushi places do this expecting most of their customers not to be familiar with what certain fishes look like. But since we aren't paying for each piece individually, it's hard to feel like it's something worth complaining about.  Ultimately, if we have a hankering for something they specifically have on their menu, we would probably go back. But if we only want AYCE sushi, there are better and slightly cheaper places to go to.",

I really like how you can order half rolls, that way you can try more things without eating way too much. We did have a little miscommunication at one point - we were told one of the \"special\" things that we can only order one per person was just one piece per order. It turned out that was only one specific \"special\" thing and the other specials were two pieces. We ended up receiving way more pieces than expected. They let us give them back with no extra charge! Overall, I think the fish here is fresh and I would definitely come again.",

The sashimi melts in your mouth, the rolls are phenomenal. Happy hour is 9-12 so give it a shot.  Lunch is a good time to come should you want to avoid a wait. The evenings tend to get a lot of traffic so be prepared to wait for a bit to be seated, but it is so worth the wait. If you have space in your tummy after AYCE and Happy Hour, try the Honey Toast desert!  Then prepare to go into a Food coma all thanks to Kaizen and it's friendly staff. Pure sushi bliss.

They're one of the only places that serve the specific OCTOPUS SALAD that i love! Oh please please try it! It's so good with the rice vinegar!  Btw, their genmaicha green tea is SO GOOD! It's so good that I really needed to mention that in this review! But anyways, let's talk about the sushi!  This is the ONLY AYCE sushi place I can go to that consistently serves fresh yellowtail nigiri. I don't know what it is but it's hard to find good yellowtail nigiri that isn't fishy in AYCE places. I finally found it here! It's also good as a handroll! The salmon hand rolls are also very good. The nigiris are so yummy.  They even have my favorite version of the Japanese lasagna roll. It's just better here especially because they add crunch on top to balance the creamy cream cheese!! Haven't seen other places do that!  Don't forget to ask for fresh wasabi! They have the real deal. Not just the green paste. If you know... YOU KNOW!   Man, I really love this place. All cravings satisfied! We'll be back soon!!",

We ordered some of the sashimi they had available with AYCE and it was GREAT. They limit you with the good stuff, but still, at the AYCE price, you are definitely getting your money's worth here. I even brought a friend who doesn't eat a lot of sushi and she LOVED it. I will definitely be back here.",

Some of the main things I order are:  - a BUNCH of nigiri: salmon (favorite), tuna, unagi, uni (one order per person, favorite), ikura (one order per person, favorite), super white tuna, toro (one order per person), yellowtail belly (one order per person) - sashimi: for all you can eat, there are a few choices for sashimi & you can get up to 3 orders per person. Including oysters!  - beef tataki: must have! One order per person  - rolls: orange blossom is the BEST, Japanese lasagna.. honestly I mainly order nigiri & try a few rolls here & there haha. But these are my top 2 rolls that I've tried here.  - hot foods: soft shell crab, mussels, short ribs, pork belly (melts in your mouth!), KFC - desserts: tempura cheese cake, PRO TIP: add ice cream on top of it! You won't regret it. Mochi ice cream, creme brulee, mini honey toast, ice cream in a cone (we take these to go sometimes!). I've ordered all of these at some point & each one was SO GOOD. The tempura cheesecake is my favorite though I think.   *Take a look at their specials for the day, they change occasionally. We've scores some AMAZING nigiri from their specials.   The place itself is a decent size, but when it gets busy expect a long wait. Service is on point, even on busy days. There was maybe once or twice where it took awhile to get some service, but only because the place was PACKED.    Overall, I don't think I've ever been disappointed by Kaizen. Another plus, they give out stamp cards! BUY 10 AYCE, GET ONE FREE!!",

The last few time I come in I wait way to long even though there are empty tables then people come in after me and get seated right away. I've tried making reservations and there's always some excuse why I can't make them. I believe that an all you can eat sushi shouldn't be able to make reservations but the times I have waited it seems they only seat people who supposedly had made them. Which makes me think reservations are only for certain people. There is a lot of favoritism here and they don't treat every customer the same. Im so sad that I will not be coming back again after seeing empty tables and after waiting over an hour while other people get seats right away.",

It's not busy right now and we have been here since around 1240pm for lunch......we are finally just getting our 4 appetizers 15 minutes after we have eaten our sushi..And then for the waitresses to come over and say do u want to order anything esle, I was like I'd just like the rest of the food we ordered to come out before ordering anything else..........The appetizers were too well done.....and then she just came over and was like sorry for the wait I'm the only one here.....that would be fine and understandable....if it were no dead in here.....service is just a little too slow for a place that is not busy......",

The service was still excellent but the food was a bit disappointing. A lot of the appetizers I ordered were not even available. We went to eat an early dinner around 4:30pm, so how could they run out of so many things already? I wasn't really that bothered since I go for the sushi anyways, but then I hit another wall. I usually go for their delish screaming O salad but it didn't even seem like screaming O salad at all. Also, not all, but some of the nigiri did not look or taste very fresh. I'm still skeptical about going again but I might give it one more chance considering how much I loved it before.",

The service is typically great, unless they get slammed then it is good. Also the food is consistent, which I find important because I have been to other sushi places and gotten a completely different dish when ordering the same item on two different visits. The Kaizen seems to be really on top of what they provide and I recommend going, though suggest checking it out during non-peak hours.",

    "text": "This is by far my favorite AYCE sushi restaurant. The manager and staff treat my family well every time we come here. Usually when we come, we're always in a table of 10+. The wait for the sushi and food is sometimes long but it's worth the wait.   We start with the nigiri sashimi first, oysters, uni, toro, negotoro, and rolls last (only because that's the most filling) This is the only restaurant where I would eat oysters. No where else. Hamachi Kama is a must with a side of rice and garlic ahi tuna nigiri is my favorite. It has a nice ponzu taste.  I recommend getting a stamp card when visiting and it's always good to call for reservations.",

    "text": "I didn't realize that I reviewed this place already but who cares I love this place so here we go...  I have been to Kaizen multiple times since living in Las Vegas and every visit gets better and better.  I order the shiitake mushroom rolls, veggie tempura and make it an all you can eat (call me greedy but I like it) sometimes I'll order other vegan options but I know what I want and every time it is served it makes me want it more and more.  Unfortunately the goodness of their food is not the sole reason for awesomeness of this restaurant.  Every time we have visited Kaizen we've been waited on by a woman who we call Pear. She is the ABSOLUTE best waitress I have ever encountered in my life time. I have never been waited on by a waitress who remembers not only our names but what we ate, what we liked, what we didn't like, our preferences, my vegan lifestyle, where we like to sit and she greets us as if we're all friends. She makes this place a treat to be at.  Unfortunately the other waitresses at Kaizen do not appear share this enthusiasm but they could always improve and they aren't horrible but they also aren't great either.  Pear appears to take her job very seriously, she seems to understand the value of customer service and she utilizes it to perfection.  We have been to Kaizen on two other occasions and we had a different waiter the last time we went. I don't remember her name but it's probably because I literally couldn't hear her voice, her table attendance was unsatisfactory but miraculously PEAR showed up midway through our visit and she assisted us tremendously. Hopefully the other waitress took notes on how Pear did her job.  Also, last but DEFINITELY not least. The cooks at Kaizen are simply AMAZING, I am probably the King of returning my food due to mishaps and miscommunications on my orders but I have NEVER returned a plate at Kaizen (i don't want to jinx myself) it's highly unlikely though as these cooks have absolutely perfected this cuisine. I love this place and I strongly recommend you go and try it especially if you're vegan. This is one of the rare moments where I can fully enjoy sushi that I actually REALLY like.  Thank you Pear for your outstanding service and efforts and thank you Kaizen for your existence and location (really close to my home ) I will definitely be returning for my shiitake mushroom rolls and vegetable tempura.",

We ordered the all you can eat for two of us. As usual, we ordered the uni which I almost gagged because it smelled and tasted like shit. I told the server and didn't get a response. We ordered it again thinking it would be better. This time my wife gagged and spit it out. The aftertaste left in our mouths made this experience very unpleasant.I advised the manager and he responded that we were the only ones to complain and that nobody else complained and walked off. Total disregard for our unpleasant experience. No apology. Bad management.",

He had assured me that this place was good from his past experiences, and he was right. I enjoyed the food. Our hostess was extremely nice and also acted as a waitress, helping the other wait staff check on us during our meal. I do have to agree with others that once it got busier around dinner rush, staff visits were less frequent.  Going back to the food, it was good quality for the most part. I think my least favorite item was a roll with scallops and mushrooms - sorry, but it was kinda soupy with sauce. My absolute favorite though was the Crazy Boy! Hahaha... I like deep fried rolls! Drinks were also decent.",

It was a fun way to sample many different parts of the menu that I found interesting. Food and Sushi were good.  I would definitely go to one of my other spots if I wanted strictly sushi but this was very good for someone who's wanting to try several items on the menu or is hungry to eat a lot on a budget. I was seated right away the dinner rush was on and it was very noisy but that is to be expected in such an environment.  Nice experience I believe it would be a fun location to go with a group and like all-you-can-eat establishments they will charge you for uneaten food. I would definitely come again in a group setting, although probably not as a single or couple.  Very good place to visit if you're on a budget.",

It's out of the way but it's worth it (especially if you live in Henderson/ South Vegas) Everyone was respectful, great atmosphere, and the staff service was amazing! The lunch deal is greatly affordable (especially when you can eat like me) for the rolls they serve. This is my favorite Kaizen place in all of town where I felt the service and food was lacking.  Staff was extremely charismatic and charming. The waiter accidentally filled my Sprite with water but quickly apologized and changed it. (No one is perfect) They are extremely catering for all of their patrons, even as it started to fill later in my visit. Definitely will come by again! Ps. Baked Salmon rolls were great! A must try!",

The price at Kaizen is unmatched for the quality and taste of food you are getting. And to top it all off its AYCE for only $22 (lunch). 98% of the menu is apart of the AYCE deal so you can order anything from sushi to tapas. The service is great and the restaurant is clean. The sushi chefs are always in a positive up-beat mood which makes for a better dining experience.   Definitely have not found a sushi establishment comparable to Kaizen anywhere in CA! Keeps me looking forward to visiting Vegas again.",

It getting harder to distinguish one from the rest. I always start with the quality of the fish. It all about freshness and if place is busy another plus knowing go through the fish. Second would be the rice. All I really order is nigiri sushi. Another thing look for is diversity in the menu. Kaizen hits all the standards I look for in AYCE sushi.  All the nigiri order was awesome. Everything had tasted fresh and looked amazing. Sushi rice was good. I did notice they use machine made nigiri rice. The diversity on the menu is pretty overwhelming for my first visit. The menu more like novel then my normal go to spot. I enjoy they have more options comes to appetizers. Most of them not really think sushi. Kalbi or Chicken Katsu. Or cold side different sashimi options and oysters on half shell. Section need make sure order from!   Overall solid option for AYCE sushi. Service was nothing but five stars from the minute walking in!",

My favorites from today's AYCE lunch are the following:   * Monster Roll - for you spicy lovers out there order this!   * Steak Tatake - 5 pieces, juicy and flavorful  * Gyoza - wow, this is good too  *SALMON sashimi - like buttah! Good!  Seriously this place has such a high rating for a reason. The staff is friendly, the food is fresh and the ambiance is chill. Lunch is the best time since it doesn't get crowded.

The waitress had to stay and watch the chef make it . So within 25 minutes at the sushi bar I got my one order of unagi . I know good unagi & this isn't it . If you go, order something else . You will pay dearly if you do not listen . As for the order time , probably call in before you leave home & order your sashimi .   No bueno : sushi bar or Unagi  Bueno : waitress staff & obviously the tables that got their rolls as I waited at the sushi bar. ( 5 stars for them)",

    "text": "This is a long overdue review of my all time favorite sushi restaurant in Las Vegas. Please bare with me as I have quite a bit to say about this place.   First and for most I would like to start this review about the staff. You may say it might be slightly biased because we visit this place on a weekly to biweekly basis (yes it's that good!) due to this they now know us by name however even before we were known by name the service was on point which has made us a regular Now that we are Personally known there we receive our order just after we have been seated at our favorite seats at the bar by the head chef without even having to ask as if we were some type of celebrity! Which I assure you I am not however that's the A list style service we receive. Every chef behind the bar shows care and concern about every roll that they put out and they are made with perfection every time I've had them. All of the wait staff is courteous and ready to help and ensure that our drinks are always full and ready to take our next order with a smile! If it's your first time visiting don't be alarmed that only the select wait staff will take your order and the others will only get your drinks and take away your dishes   now let's talk about the food My favorite items Which I highly recommend to order is the salmon belly, garlic tuna, unicorn, spicy rainbow, lion, Alaska, Green chili, sunset, shrimp lover, scallop volcano, And their garlic mayo salmon which I hope they add to the menu as it is a chef special every now and then we go for the barbecue roll which is short ribs inside a sushi roll let me tell you it's amazing but Filling. (No fish in that roll by the way!) all their fish is extremely fresh and taste amazing we also have awesome appetizers I typically get the fried Gyosa, shrimp tempura the KFC chicken which is absolutely delicious, and the eggrolls cause Yep I'm a sucker and I love em! Oooooo and don't forget the fresh wasabi it is worth a three dollar extra charge  OK so let's talk price if you've ever been to an all you can eat sushi place then you can expect the same price across the board just like here it's only 28 bucks for all you can eat and let me tell you it's all you can eat yes they say they have a set time limit however I have never seen them hold anyone to that time limit including myself who has spent more than an hour here. Keep in mind there are nights that they're super busy and they know that so they're not going to hold that time limit against you but it is there so be cautious when you're just being lazy and hanging out! eat your food so I can get my butt in my seat to!   In a nutshell when I ask my girlfriend where do you want to go eat we always end up here there's no better place that I would like to spend my hard earned money then my favorite place kaizen sushi",

I came here with a friend and we ate WAY too much; I was one of the most full I have ever been in my life during a dinner her.  Service was adequate and the decor was nice.",

I'm a bit of a sushi fanatic (read \"sushi addict\" there) and the Kaizen Henderson location has to be one of the best I've ever had. Great food, great people and great atmosphere.   If I could make one tiny suggestion for improvement, it would be to please add iCing sparkling rice wine to the drinks menu.  But, even with that bit, this place is most definitely a \"cant miss\" spot for any sushi lover.  (ORDER THE MOUNTAIN!!!!! My mouth was on fire after it, but tasted soooooooo good!!)",

    "text": "When my family and I visit Vegas, we tend to stay closer to the strip or the Centennial Hills area. This time around, we happened to be in the Henderson area for the Pure Aloha Festival at the Silverton Hotel. We originally thought they were the same owners as the Kaizen Sushi in Centennial Hills, which is what made us stop here, but the waitress told us that they weren't. We were so hungry it didn't really matter to us.   Anyhow, initially upon walking in, the restaurant was a bit small, but in a good, cozy kinda way. We were greeted by a very friendly waitress named Nor (my apologies if I misspelled her name). She sat us down right away and was really great at offering suggestions on what to try. Of course, we opted for their all you can eat sushi. We did find similarities in the menu as the Kaizen in Centennial which helped up pick certain favorite sushi rolls as well. You definitely get your money's worth. I loved how quick they were about cleaning your plates once you finished eating a dish. Some places let it pile up, but not here. Nor was such a delight and always checked up on us before we even needed to look around for her.   We tried so many different dishes and sushi. A fav of ours is the crazy girl roll! I also loved that they had a weekend special menu that you could order from also. They had a lobster roll on there that was delicious! Finished off our lunch with a strawberry mochi and creme brulee. Yum!  The service and food were so great, we plan on stopping by here first once we visit Vegas again soon!",

I used to frequent here often when I lived up the street in Anthem and now I come in when I am doing business in the area.   For the price of the AYCE the selection is spot on. I have come here with sushi lovers and not so sushi lovers and there has been something for everyone. Half rolls can be ordered which is always helpful especially when you do not want a whole roll. The Nigiri is great as well as the standard rolls and specialty rolls.   For what is on the menu and the variety of appetizers, little bites, rice, desserts, seafood, sushi, meat items, etc - Kaizen is pretty solid. They also have a great SakeTinni!  Don't forget to get your stamp card stamped! Everyone loves a good card stamp!",

I had a whole wonderful dinner, and the service to match its memorable experience.  First off, this is a sit down buffet with four pages of items to choose from. For me being my first time here, was amazed with everything what the server recommended, and all you can eat desserts too from tempura ice cream, Mochi ball assorted ice cream, and a different take to green tea flan.   I find this place to be a hidden gem for tourists like myself, but will be back here again for another round. Highly recommend this place!",

    "text": "The sushi here is tasty. There is a large selection of baked rolls for those who insist on sushi, but dislike raw fish. Their nigiri is fresh and cuts of fish generous. Their AYCE is around $27, the menu is pretty extensive and it is higher quality of sushi. My favorite rolls were Kiss of Fire and Silver State.  Why only 2 stars?   There were several rolls we ordered, as well as an order of uni that never made it out. In fact, in the middle of our service, they stopped coming to take our order altogether. There were four of us, all indulging in AYCE. When the server came by, he mentioned that the chefs were backed up. The restaurant wasn't even half full. This is where the greedy part comes in. They purposefully spaced it so that we would eventually just get tired or decide we are full and leave. To be fair, they did comp our drinks ($7.50) due to the wait without us asking. But that hardly makes up for not getting several rolls we ordered, yet signed for a $120 bill. Also, the ladies' bathroom toilet didn't flush. Big yuck!  On the next visit, boyfriend's brother's fiance asked me to go back with her. I did, and the greedy part was reaffirmed and I am most definitely not coming back. I initially didn't think I'd have much food so I didn't opt for AYCE... I ordered a cucumber salad and two rolls (not realizing that I was close to $35 already). Now, I had done something similar at another sushi joint, where I just ordered what I remembered I enjoyed as AYCE as a la carte, and then had the waitress suggest that I should just go AYCE because what I ordered was well over the AYCE price. I appreciated that type of service and looking out for the customer instead of pocketing extra $20 and losing 5+ repeat customers.  Oh, yeah, they also forgot one of my rolls and we just sat around while they brought it out. Apparently the chefs thought they had already filled that order. The sheer greediness this place exhibited left  a horrible impression. I am not asking for freebies, but I also will not be taken advantage of. Their lack of customer focus cost them 5 certain repeat customers, and probably many more people I would have brought there, because the sushi is actually pretty good.  It is located in the Buffalo Wild Wings parking lot on Eastern. The parking on weekends is a nightmare.",

Ambiance is bright, fun and immaculate. they have music videos as well as sports on multiple tv's, but the room never gets loud or annoying.  Service is great. Even when they are swamped they make sure every single guest is happy and attended to. One of the GM's even hopped behind the sushi bar to assist me on his night off! I ale saw the owner running food for the kitchen, talk about a passionate team! Their nigiri was exceptional! My favorite was the hamachi toro, saba (the best I've had), and the uni was incredible.  I would love to go back on a slow night so I can truly be blown away.",

    "text": "The fish to rice ratio at kaizen is perfect. It's not overloaded with rice which most sushi restaurants do. Everything my boyfriend and I ordered was very delicious and fresh. Don't really have a complaint about the food at all but the customer service can be way better.   This was our first time eating A.Y.C.E. At kaizen.. and well we just didn't feel welcomed at all. At first we thought they were short staffed so we didn't really think of it. We even felt bad for the girl who was our server because it looked like she had a lot of people sitting in her station. After awhile though the guy who sat us was taking orders in the same station. So seeing this we were hoping our server would have time to acknowledge us after dropping off our orders. But there was no how is everything going, or EVEN are you guys ready to order more clearly seeing our plates that were delivered has been cleared. WE ALWAYS HAD TO FLAG HER DOWN. And no we weren't even sitting in a back corner of the restaurant we were sitting right in the middle in front of the bar... There was one person on the other hand that actually made us feel welcomed, and it was the busser. He actually asked us how we were doing and how was everything tasting,every time he refilled our glasses or clearing our plates. Even when we were sitting there waiting for the check asked us if there wasn't anything else we would like.   I would go back just for the sushi and this time just sit at the bar instead of the table if the service stays the same. Can't really knock off stars just because two people who actually had to deal with the customers had bad customer service towards us. So for the food itself I give this place 5 stars for the two servers who didn't bother to acknowledge us I give you guys a 3 just because when the girl did acknowledge us she was polite.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying that my hubby and I are forever grateful to our friends for introducing us to this Sushi restaurant as we are always reluctant to try new Sushi restaurants as there are so many along Eastern that have been a disappointment.  Our friends are Korean and they took us here because it is a Korean/Japanese fusion restaurant.  On our first visit with our friends, we let them take control and just order for our table.  At that time there was no All You Can Eat menu yet so everything we had was A La Carte.  We ordered the party tray which is a variety of Sushi, Sashimi, Rolls, and Tempura on a Large wooden Boat.  Our children had the 2 item Bento special with Chicken Katsu and Tempura Vegetable.  We were pleasantly surprised to have been served \"FRESH\" Wasabi rather then your typical wasabi paste. Our friends ordered a side of gochujang sauce (Korean hot pepper paste sauce) and my hubby always gets a side of ponzu for his sushi and rolls (instead of using soy sauce).  Ok are you ready for this...if you mix the (1) fresh wasabi, (2)gochujang and (3)ponzu all together you have will have an amazing dip for your sushi, rolls, and pretty much everything else you're eating at your table!  YES it is THAT good!  We even shared this bit of information with the Sushi Chef.  By the way the Chefs/Waiters, and waitresses are extremely friendly.  The atmosphere of the entire restaurant is just inviting.  There is a large screen that plays random music videos and of course they have \"Gangnam Style\" on rotation and if your nice the Sushi Chef will even do the dance for you  if you ask.    Since our first visit to this restaurant, they have added an All You Can Eat option for lunch and dinner.  We were at first worried because usually when an All You Can Eat is added on a Sushi menu all that means is All You Can Eat (poorer) quality fish...BUT NOT at Kaizen!  They use the same fresh ingredients in their A la Carte menu that they do on the All You Can Eat menu.  The Sushi Chef's will also be more then happy to do customized rolls if you don't see what you want on the menu or if you dare to try something new.  I will also add that with All You Can Eat there is a salad bar available that is A-mazing!  If you order A la Carte, the salad bar is on $5 and they give you a decent size bowl.  The salad bar has Mixed Greens, Tuna Sashimi, Cucumber/mango salad, Crab Salad with Jalapeno, Seaweed salad, sweet octopus, and a variety of fish salad.    I will end this with, we have not eaten Sushi anywhere else since we started coming here...their service is consistent and their food is superb! You will not be disappointed.",

I guess I'll take the fault for not reading that deep into the menu. I'm new to the area so I guess I'll keep looking around for a decent sushi spot.",

As a restaurant employee I expect more care to be given to the customer's experience.

I would definitely recommend to come on the weekends; there's always a special, be it new fish, drinks, or even appetizers. It is always changing.   I come to eat here for nigiri and a lot of the times I also order \"Fresh Wasabi\" it's a great add-on to nigiri so if you love nigiri I highly recommend you get that instead of the stock wasabi that comes with the meal.   The menu is very large and you really do not need to only eat sushi here I honestly would come here just for the appetizers, the mussels and creamy shrimp are very good, actually a majority of the appetizers are good LOL, trust me I know.   Ok my favorite roll here would have to be the Sex Bomb Roll  And my favorite appetizer would be the Baked mussel   And my favorite dessert would be the creme brulee",

The quality of the food served was above par for the area and the range on the menu was phenomenal. There was a wide selection of rolls free of mayo and cream cheese, which I always count as a plus. There were also reasonable limitations set on certain items. I ate here for lunch and would have loved to have tried some otoro or amaebi nigiri but they were both restricted to dinner, which is fully understandable given the price difference.  The highlights of the meal were the Screaming O salad, surf clam nigiri, and Crazy Girl roll (again, personally would have preferred it without cream cheese, but it was melted and soft and didn't significantly affect the taste).  For dessert, the creme brulee (vanilla) and mochi ice cream (green tea) tasted a bit off, but the scoop of red bean ice cream was some of the best I've had.",

We stayed like 10 mints at the entry( nobody came ask us if we want a table or so) it was pretty full and just one server. He finally came ask us if we need a table and then we told him what happened last time and why we didn't come here since. We also asked him if today he can take care of us not like last time. And he said smiling\" today maybe is going to be the same\" my husband couldn't believe what he just said. So he asked him \" how so?\" The waiter answered\" well is going to be like 30-40 mints untill i can take your order\" so we said \"ok we're leAving\"... he let us leave. Very rude! Since i moved in US It never happened this to me . People usualy apologize and then make it up ... i will never come back here anymore.",

    "text": "I really hate giving this place two stars.  Let me start by saying that the food is really good.  The problem with this place is service.  Our first experience was on a busy Friday night.  We chose to sit at the sushi bar, and only because the sushi chef would personally hand our items to us and then ask if we wanted anything else, was the service acceptable.  The young lady who was serving us was very friendly, but by the looks of things, the restaurant was understaffed.  We did the all you can eat (AYCE) program at dinner and the value is worth it as it basically includes almost everything on their menu.     Then we decided to visit yesterday (Memorial Day) at 12:45.  The restaurant was moderately busy with several open tables and over the half the sushi bar seats open.  We were quickly seated at a table- and then it began. Or I should say it didn't.  My husband and son got the AYCE and I ordered a lunch special.  They delivered drinks right a way, and soups for me and my son.  The rest of the experience was a DISASTER.  One appetizer took 45 minutes - for THREE TEMPURA SHRIMP???  My lunch special came out on its own - and so I sat there WAITING for the rolls my husband and son ordered.  Literally 10 minutes later they brought one roll each.  Then over the course of the next 35 minutes they brought my sons other rolls (2) - but never my husbands.  So, in over one hour - my husband had one roll and three tempura shrimp.  We complained to the waitress - who kept switching out with another girl - and she said \"I know -we hate it too - but you ordered cooked food'.  REALLY - my husband had a salmon roll that was tempura on the inside.  It takes 1 hr 20 minutes to cook tempura????  The table next to us was on the same slow train -but interestingly enough other tables were being served on a faster pace. We even had put in two rolls at a time (based on a previous experience) and it didn't matter.  The girl delivering the food was not our waitress so she would just say what it was - with no clue who it was for (which is a little confusing for us at the table trying to remember all the names of the rolls and who ordered what).  Then some guy not even dressed in uniform dropped a roll - and we asked what it was- and his reply was \"I DONT KNOW- THEY JUST TOLD ME IT GOES HERE\".  It was  NIGHTMARE.  My husband and son eventually ordered dessert, and after they ate it - the waitress came by our table and asked if the roll order she had in her hand was for us - REALLY?  Come on - get it together.  We couldn't even get the waitress to come back to bring us the check!  My husband had to go up to the front to get it.   I wish I could blame it on being busy. The woman at the register said this was the busiest Memorial Day they had in three years.  They definitely needed more wait staff and probably at least one more sushi chef.  We noticed by the time we left it seemed like they had called people in to work.  But it was the same bad service on a busy Friday night as it was on a medium busy Monday afternoon.  Again, the food is very good - but there is NO management on the floor (or apparent) and they seemingly are running understaffed which doesnt lead to a good dining experience.",

There's the obligatory Japanese pop music playing loudly. The sushi chefs appeared to be Japanese, which bodes well.   The food (pictures have been posted!): Boyfriend had the shrimp tempura roll and the beef teriyaki bowl. I sampled the roll; it was delicious. Anything covered in that much eel sauce is bound to make me happy! He said the bowl was good, but the beef was cut too thinly. I had the salmon teriyaki roll and the hungry roll. They were good, not great. The portions were big, which is something I always worry about when it comes to sushi.   All in all, I doubt we'll be back. I'm very sure that there are better places to try, so I don't see the point in going back for food that wasn't as good as it can be!",

Ambiance - 5 Star - Very nice. trendy, clean, black motif, big TV playing cool stuff, neon signs with all the specials.  Right smack in middle is the sushi chefs all there of you to watch.  Food - 4 star - Had the kiss of fire ( jalepeno topped) roll, and Rainbow Roll.  I liked the fact that the jalepeno was cut so thin that it added a nice flavor to the roll instead of overwhelming the taste.  Rainbow roll was fine, nothing special. Was with the wife and had sushi earlier in the week, so I did not get my favorites to really compare this restaurant to the others,  However, it was good average sushi so I give it 4 star.  Chef - 4 star - We sat at the table at this one and Jay Kim was very nice and friendly.  Trained in Japan, I wonder how many others are trained in Japan.  Price - 4 star - For two rolls, two drinks, came up to like 35.00 with tip so it was okay, if a tad expensive.   Nice place, nice team there, good bento boxes and other things to eat. Nice noodle choices as well.  Overall very nice and would come back.",

When I first bit into each of them, it was a piece of heaven I was biting into. It was amazing. The food was fresh, hot, and fast service. The bus boy was always making sure we had our drinks right and if we needed anything else so that was nice. The actual waiter messed up on about 3 orders but no harm done. I would def recommend this place to anybody.",

    "text": "I feel terrible to have to write this bad review because this has been one of my favorite restaurants for years but today was an absolute epic fail for them.  The wait staff has always been superb and still was. We walked in today being greeted with the same smiles as usual and got our favorite table. We ordered our usual ayce menu items.  We noticed first hand the sushi fish was a little warmer temperature than it is suposed to be so we decided to go with more of the cooked items that we like to get, not wanting to get sick from bacteria that grows in raw food at the wrong temperature. As our order of pan fried mackerel came out it was head in tact and only the top half of the fish.  as my significant other took one bite he spit out something long and red that didn't look normal.  I honestly thought it was a garnish until he opened up the fish to reveal several red worms. When he confronted the waitress oneeta she was very nice but I don't think agreed they were worms until she took the fish to the back to show the chef or cook named Juan. It was obvious this was a big deal because she came and profusely apologized telling us thank u for bringing it to thier attention as they must send the entire shipment back because it could be infected with the worms as well.  She then proceeded to tell us the meal was comped and asked if we wanted anything else.  We ordered an item or two but just felt grossed out after and couldn't do it. I drank some sake tipped the sweet waitress and left.  I love all the people that work the front as servers and sushi chefs but realize this really needs a note to warn people to be careful if u are eating there! check inside all the fish u order and also demand they get thier refrigerators working properly or that they make sure they're food is being stored at the proper temperature for this could cause a lot of sick people.  I've heard that people have died from worms in thier bodies and terrible food poisoning. I got nauseas after I left just thinking about it again in my head and pulled over to vomit a bit unfortunately.  We shall see if my significant other gets sick. Here's hoping he doesn't but just please be aware.  My apologies to the dear staff there I love u all but this had to be said.  Thank you.",

I left my favorite sushi spot, Sushi Studio, in Long Beach, CA and nothing has been nearly as good (other than Nobu which we can only afford once a year and knocks EVERY other sushi restaurant out of the water). Checked out Kaizen last night with my husband and we were happily impressed. The fish was so fresh and the cuts were nice and thin, the flavors were great, loved the half roll options, and the price is right. I'm glad we took a chance, without a recommendation, and tried Kaizen. I don't easily give 5 stars, but when we go back to Kaizen, and it's equally as good as last night (showing consistency), my 4.5 stars WILL be 5.",

I could say taste is everything, but I'd be lying, customer service is #1, followed by taste, price, etc., etc., so on and so on. When deciding between my three top spots, on the real, it usually depends on how many more days till my next pay day. I'm happy to say this place exceeded all of my expectations. The customer service was above par. We were greeted and seated by a hostess, with a smile, our busboy was attentive, and friendly, also with a smile that just put him over the top. The sushi chef was all of those things and more, he paired a couple of bottles of Sake with our meal and returned several times to pour us another, as needed. You might say this is typical or average service, and while I agree, it isn't unheard of, it has been my experience that, \"typical\" is average to mediocre and worse. For a, strip mall sushi joint, at 5:30 on a Tuesday, I felt like a VIP, thank God the food was exceptional. This is #1 on my list of favorites.",

    "text": "The worst service I have ever experienced. Came in for AYCE lunch with my girlfriend. At the time there was only one other person eating at the sushi bar. Every time we asked to order food, the waiter, Daniel, said \"One second\" and kept walking away. The first time he did it, he walked to the front entrance where no one was and just stood there. The second time we tried to order sushi, he again put his finger up and said \"one second\", walked to the table behind us and checked on them. Ended up taking a massive food order from their table, then proceeded to check up on another table after that. About 20 minutes later, still no return to our table, because he instead was just standing watching tv. I tried again to order, by waving him over to our table. He put his finger up again and singled \"one second\" and went to another table. Let me remind you, I interrupted him from watching TV. I finally got him to our table and Once again he said \"one second\" walked away from us and took orders from tables else where. We are small girls. We don't eat a lot. We weren't abusing the AYCE system, not even close. In fact, every order he took other than ours out weighed us by x3. It was clearly discrimination. My girlfriend and I have never experienced such rude, clearly discriminatory service before. I Would not only never come back here, I'm going to be extremely vocal in my highly publicly involved job in Vegas about how bad the service is at this place. Save your self a bad experience and go to I Love Sushi!",

The Missus and I bellied up to the sushi bar and after some soul searching, we elected the AYCE offering She usually doesn't do AYCE because she is a light eater, but this time I think she got her money's worth. Dishes that were a hit were the hamachi, the pork belly(!), and every roll we ordered was great.  Monkey Brain was a fun taste. AYCE price was reasonable and the service was prompt and friendly. Struck up a good conversation with a couple that were regulars. Kaiser seems to have a loyal following. We may be joining the fan club",

They have plenty of appetizers to choose from, a good selection of rolls as well as a fair selection of nigiri/sushi. If I had to complain about something, it would probably be their sashimi which is very limited quantity for AYCE - but this is understandable because you have to do what makes sense for the business. Personally, I would just take it off the menu. Anyway, the quality of fish has never disappointed, the amount of rice on the nigiri is reasonable.  I'm not a huge fan of dessert, but their desserts could use some work. The cheesecake is not really cheesecake, nor is the tiramisu legit tiramisu but you can never go wrong with ice cream. The servers are always very nice and the chefs churn out the sushi at a good pace even on a busy night. Enjoy the service and make sure you get a punch card!",

Decent amount of tables and places to sit at the bar and the music is lively as well.  One thing I love is that the menu is pretty extensive. Many different types of rolls! There's even sweet rolls that have strawberries and bananas to fill your sweet craving while eating nigiri and sushi rolls. :)  Here's the best part for people who enjoy dessert: AYCE lets you have as much dessert at the end as you want. (At least it seemed that way we each ordered 4 different types ). Try the mini honey toast and the green tea creme brulee (along with the green tea deep fried ice cream and Mochi ice creams) ! So delicious and some are different from other desserts that you can get at other sushi restaurants!",

I've been here many many times before at all different hours and the place closes at 2. No where on the website or on the menu do they advertise that after midnight there is no all you can eat pricing. The waiter tells us that there is no all you can eat after midnight.   I said I didn't know and is there any way he could honor the pricing since it was midnight exactly and that wasn't something that was known. Rather than saying no sorry that's our policy he says the system is down and we can't do that. I asked of the system is down how were they going to ring us up and he laughed and said the all you can eat system is down.   Just be honest. Say you can't. Don't make up stories that even make you chuckle at how terrible it sounds.   We ended up leaving disappointed not because we had to pay but because the staff was disingenuous. And they have you write yelp reviews for free menu items which are against yelp policy. Won't be making the drive back from the southwest",

    "text": "Maybe I was unfortunate considering all these positive reviews, but this place was definitely a huge let down on many different levels.  Coming into the place it's small and the walls are painted pea soup green.  For those of you unaware of what that color is, it's what guacamole looks like after it's been exposed to air for 15-20 minutes.  Not pretty.  Whatever, maybe it was part of their theme.  We were meeting some friends there and easily found them.  The sushi bar is in the middle of the restaurant, but looks more like a DJ booth - off standish and nothing really to look at.  It was overly large, as if their tiny establishment could serve far more than they could fit.  We sat down and started with a couple of sake bombs.  The waitress kept saying \"300 dollars\" instead of \"300 milliliters\" when our friends asked about the house sake size in comparison to the named sake size.  Since it was -just- sake bombs we didn't feel a need to spend a lot on the sake.  She kept diverting the question and trying to use her cutesy accent to avoid giving a direct answer - a wonderful theme that continued for the rest of the night.  The sake and beer arrive and we are presented with plastic beer mugs that looks like they should have been retired quite some servings ago.  OK, maybe they keep them for the bombs since they have the potential of being, ehrm, \"destructive.\"  One nice point - the sushi chef came out to count down for our first round and that was fun.  After that, the waitress said we couldn't just \"sit there and drink\" and that there was a \"law\" that we had to order food while we were there.  All of us had planned on eating and had told her that BEFORE we ordered the sake bombs, but OK.  Sure.  We had to tell her on four separate occasions we were ready to order.  Yet she kept finding things to do, like assisting the two small parties outside of our group of 5 - mind you, the three tables were the ONLY ones in the restaurant at 6pm on a Friday night.  So after she had JUST made it a point to tell us to basically order food or pay your bill and leave because it was a LAW, she REFUSED to come over until one of the people at our table said, \"We'd like to order NOW.\"  Ordered our food and when she came to me I ordered the Las Vegas Roll.  She said if I order more I would get a discount, but if I only ordered one I would get no discount.  I asked, \"Oh, is the second roll 50% off, then?\" because there is a sign outside the establishment that says, \"Sushi 50% All The Time.\"  She paused for a moment, then said, \"You get a discount.\"  Thank you for letting me know AGAIN I get a discount, but that doesn't tell me WHAT I get.  I rephrased my question, \"How much of a discount?\"  She replied, \"Oh, you know, discount off second roll.\"  This was obviously going somewhere.  I said, \"I'll think about it after the first roll, thank you,\" and she gave me a wan smile.  She also asked how we'd like to split the sake and the beer since we mentioned 3 of us were on one tab and 2 of us on another.  She kept making it sound like we could not split it because there was a monetary difference between the sake and beer, saying we had to \"order more to even it out.\"  None of us really understood at first because she was really thickening up her accent, and were really confused.  We asked if we could decide later and she said, \"Yes but it's better if you let me know now for splitting the check, ne?\"  She wasn't making a ton of sense until we pointed out that we did realize there was a difference in price and that was fine.  Once one of the members of our group said they would take the sake on theirs and the beer would go on the other, she finally bowed down from that argument.  The sushi came out fairly fast but considering it was mostly empty, what do you expect?  My Las Vegas Roll was more of a deep-fried Philadelphia roll with no smooth meaty taste of fish to really account for.  Had I ordered a deep-fried Philadelphia roll, I would have been alright with that.  It was supposed to have crab (which I did not see ANY of) and eel (which was barely there).  The edamame, at least, was OK.  Satisfied with our experience up to that point, we asked for the check, paid, and left.  The check was a fair price, at least.  When I walked out the door the waitress completely ignored me and made it a  point to walk elsewhere; I was also not acknowledged by another wait or chef staff.  Cool.  To summarize, I do NOT plan on returning to this place at all.  Service was rude, slow, and felt like you were trying to be hussled; food was mediocre at best; and the decor is average.  Take you sushi craving elsewhere.",

I'm like their food and usually  I like their service, that is the reason for the two stars.  My family has grown by two in three years.  I have never needed a reservation before but I walked in on a Thursday and I was greeted by a person I have never seen before.  She asked me if I had a reservation I said no so she asked how many in my party, I said 5 then my wife and kids walked in and all of a sudden she was very sorry but without a reservation they couldn't accommodate us even though the big table by the door on the other side of the partition was empty along with the six top table in the far corner.  I specifically asked about them and she said they were reserved.  I guess I am mad because they didn't want our business because we had kids who more than likely wouldn't be eating sushi.  So to me in my opinion this is not a family friendly place.  We left went to another sushi down the street who wanted and appreciated our business.",

We'll start with the pros: Yellowtail negiri SO THICK! It was so fresh and delicious. Apps were amazing especially the seafood pancake. We also got pork belly, a screaming o, beef, fresh fresh oysters, yummy crispy tuna, crab salad. Everything was outstanding.  We got a roll with mango, an oh roll, a calamari roll, a sunset, and a couple others. They do half rolls so you can try more stuff. Everything was super fresh and not drenched in sauces. Also, unlimited mochi. And dinner has Toro and yellowtail belly, Hamachi kama, full ribeye steaks, and whole mackerel.   The only cons is they forgot some of the stuff we ordered so we had to order multiple times even though the waitress wrote it all down. Once, a new waitress came, asked if we wanted more water and to place another order, and we said yes to both. She got us our water and then walked away and forgot about our food order. There was only one waitress that seemed to have it together. But they were all very nice and we just assumed they might be new.  Either way. So good I can overlook it.  My new favorite for sure.",

The service was horrible!!  Our waitress started out fine, then half way through our meal abandoned us, would not even make eye contact. I guess we were too much trouble for her. The table of six, that just got seated got all her attention. Had to get a different waitress to bring the check.   Had to flag down a busboy to order another beer. I usually way over tip, but I told my husband I would disown him if he left a tip. Ruined our date night. SO disappointed!  15 minutes into the dinner I thought we'd found out new favorite place. :(  The restaurant is smaller than I thought, and all the hard surfaces echo all the noise. It became too much to handle, thus, I wait outside.   I tend to avoid crab mix, Because I. do not like mayo. Actually, I loathe it. So when we ordered two rolls that did not list crab mix, I was disappointed that they were both loaded with crab mix and mayonnaise. The only thing I tasted was mayonnaise. More mayo than a tuna sandwich. Wtf?  Will NEVER go back. There are too many good restaurants in the area.   I'm so disappointed because I was lovin it! The salmon collar and the soft shell crab sweet potato appetizer were delicious.",

    "text": "My favorite AYCE sushi place! One of the reasons I love this place is the massive selection they have. They have beef short ribs, pork belly, ramen, curry, and of course sushi. It's basically a one stop shop. Especially if you can't decide what you want to eat. I would say you really get your money's worth at this place. Because once you're done with your meal, you still have dessert. Their dessert menu also has a lot of choices. From mochi ice cream to creme brulee to cheesecake. All of them are really good. Atmosphere is nice and the service is great. Don't know what to try? Ask the waiters and they will definitely give you a great suggestion. If you want the best bang for your buck and you want a lot of variety of food for your money, please go and try this place.",

Our waiter came to our table 10 min after we got there, and said \"do you want to order anything else before I go on break\" we did not see him again after that. We basically had no server taking our orders anymore. Water needed to be refilled, green tea we ordered never came out. They tried to give us a roll we didn't order and tell us we did. Food quality SUCKED. Next time go to I LOVE SUSHI down the street where they are on point and we always have a good time and great food.  Manager wouldn't even come out to speak with us after we asked to speak to one !",

The place is in a nice location, but always seems to be on the wrong side of the road, but now that I know exactly where it is, I will have no problems changing my route. The food was lovely, the staff was nice, even turning down the music a little bit, since we were seated underneath a speaker, by the monitor, The fish was nice, fresh and rather large for a AYCE. The service was a bit slower than we were used to, but part of that was how busy the place was and how indecisive we were. Many different rolls to try and I promise that we will be quicker the next time we visit. So glad we stpped in. It will not be our last.",

Instead of indulging you in the details, I'll list the complaints.   Waitresses switch midservice and confuse orders, orders are split and do not come out at the same time, waited approximately 30 min between each order of sushi came out, received the wrong sushi order, uni was brown and old and the list goes on.   Get more chefs, get competent staff and promote the bus boy because we enjoyed more refills of water than sushi orders.",

Yelp gives me away to reach more than just family and friends. I get to let them know if a place rocks or if it's not good.  I'm happy to say that Kaizen ROCKS!  Greatness in ever corner!  We were a groups of there and ordered a plathora of things to share.  Our friend was on a low carb diet so we ordered sashimi, the Hawaiian roll, salmon collar and some hot saki.  Everything was delicious, fresh and prepared to perfection.  The crispy parts around the edges of the salmon collar were mouth watering.  I would eat here again.

Came here with my daughter and all her food came before mine. When I mentioned that I haven't received one thing that I ordered yet the server stated that they would go check on my order. Few minutes later I see the server walking around and didn't come back to update me so I asked again. Server said once more let me check up on it.   By the time I received one thing I ordered, edamame, my daughter was all done with her meal. I asked the server to cancel the rest since she was done and I was over waiting but as soon as I was telling him that my two small rolls came out.   Only thing I enjoyed about this place was that you can do half orders on tons of rolls for AYCE which is great if you want to try new rolls, other than that I would not come here to eat. There are so many AYCE sushi places with better service.",

I would of understood if no one was in the restaurant but their were people still sitting and eating. This is awfulll customer service. I work in the service industry so I understand but this was flat out rude! If you are wondering what is a better sushi restaurant to go to (although they are not open late but their last seating won't be an hour before close) Sawa Sushi is the spot. It's on Blue diamond and their staff is sooo sweet! They truly care about their customers and not their \"close time.\" Do yourself a favor and go there instead! :)",

    "text": "Tried this place for the first time, and thought it wasn't too bad as far as the sushi goes. The lemon salmon sashimi was really good, you are limited to three orders per person, so definitely order the max. With AYCE it's hard to taste the difference between rolls at other sushi places, they all end up tasting similar with some combination of shrimp tempura, avocado, crab, salmon, tuna, etc. overall they were good rolls and half orders are available. They do have a lot to choose from their menu for dinner. I love mushrooms and they have a shiitake mushroom tempura roll, but I did not like it at all, tasted pretty bland and couldn't really taste the mushroom. I really liked their beef tanaki, if you like rare meat you'll like this one.  For the appetizers/hot tapas I tried the calamari tempura, muscles, beef fried rice, edamame, and the miso ramen. The calamari was ok, goyemon/sushi mon have my favorite calamari tempura at a sushi place. Muscles were a bit too fishy for my taste. Beef fried rice was good and the miso ramen tasted like cheap ramen.   They have unlimited desserts including Creme brulee And tempura cheesecake. I had the green tea Creme brulee since they were out of the vanilla, I'm usually not a fan of green tea but this one was very light on the green tea and I really enjoyed it. The tempura cheesecake was pretty good as well, very dense dessert so I recommend sharing this one.   Service was pretty bad, I would probably rate service a 1 Star. They are very slow, with a group of 5 of us it took us almost 3 hours to get all the orders we wanted. Our server was also rude and didn't appreciate him at all. Also it was very warm inside the restaurant.",

    "text": "My Bf and I wanted to try a new sushi place in our area. Stumbled across Kaizen and decided to try it. Walked in greeted by the hostess/waitress and immediately sat us down. Not busy at all with only two other couples inside.   It was our first time and we knew we wanted AYCE ($23 for lunch) sushi but weren't sure if there was a separate menu for AYCE or if we were able to order from the menu that was handed to us. Our waitress brought our drinks and asked if we were ready? Not really explaining the AYCE menu bc depending where you go certain places has their own AYCE rules.  Surprisingly there were very few things that we COULD NOT order and there were lots to choose from. Salads, bowls, soups and sides come in smaller portions which is normal and why would you wanted huge portions anyways?   I always order my Phili Roll, shrimp tempura and what caught my eye was the Crispy rice w/Tuna to start. My boyfriend also ordered his usual hamachi and maguro to start. Everything came out and actually didn't taste too bad. The only thing that I didn't like was that they put asparagus in my roll which they normally don't. I like asparagus just not in that roll  We then ordered the half a rainbow roll, yum yum roll and a dragon roll. My boyfriend loved the yum yum roll which was simple and packed with crab. The dragon and rainbow roll were meh, I felt the like the combination of sauces were not good. You had the creamy sauce and then a dark liquidy runny sauce that made what was suppose to be a creamy sauce not so creamy. Idk just not good plus what was inside didn't match well with sauces.   We also ordered shrimp fried rice, KFC (Korean Fried Chicken), screaming O salad, miso and shoyu ramen. Shrimp fried rice and KFC, so bomb! That, I'd have any time. My boyfriend said the shoyu ramen was not bad, just a bit on the watery side. My miso soup was watery and didn't have any taste. Screaming O was okay, the sauce was not your typical white creamy sauce they usually use. More on the ginger, soy kinda sauce. A little disappointed bc that's my fav!  Lastly, Desert my favorite part but also the most disappointing part. We ordered the \"mini honey toast\" when it came out it was on what looked like a Hawaiian sweet roll with vanilla ice cream and honey drizzled all over. Hmmm.. at least toast the bread? Come on that's why it's called Honey TOAST, lol. None the less it was okay I guess.  Overall the food was decent. Certain things I won't order again if I make my way back here. Just be aware to not over do it bc on the front of the menu it states that they will charge for food not eaten including rice! You also only have an hour and a half to eat.   As for service, it was lacking. There was only 3 couples including us. It took her a while to come to us to refill our drinks or place another order, so we had to flag her down every time she skipped us and went to the table right behind us. Maybe had she paid more attention to us instead of her phone I'd rate this place a bit higher bc as we were finishing up our server had changed and he was on it but by that time we were done.",

Which is totally worth it because one of the specialty rolls sits at around $14 each.   I really enjoyed the rock and roll roll since I am trying to do low carb. It is wrapped in a thin roll of cucumber and no rice! Such a nice alternative to all the rice.   They did offer so cool desserts as well. Tempura cheesecake, tempura ice cream, mini honey toast, Mochi ice cream and tiramisu!  This place is good and has a lot more variety than the other sushi places I've been to!",

So, we wanted to maximize the sashimi which we thought was included in the AYCE price. However we found out that you can order only three orders per person from their 'Sashimi and Raw Seafood' section of their menu, which is separate from 'Sashimi' section (which is not included in the AYCE). It was all very confusing and disappointing. The whole experience made me question if quantity over quality is worth it. The verdict is a resounding 'No.' At least for Kaizen Fusion Roll and Sushi in Henderson.",

When eating the nigiri, the fish had fallen off the rice and I had noticed the rice had lucked up some of the color the fish was dyed. Clearly not ok. The rolls were made sloppy and truthfully nothing tasted even remotely good. On top of that, the service was not good. It took many times to flag down our sever to order our first round of food when the restarting only had two other couples sitting down. When asking for a recommendation and if a specific dish was good (it was not), the server was short and rude about it. I will never come back and steer everyone away from this place. There are way better AYCE options than here. I just wish I could be refunded for my experience. Do not eat here!!",

    "text": "The crispy rice was burned. The spicy tuna was mealy, as though it had been pureed in a blender. The seaweed salad was watery. The mochi ice cream had mochi that was too chewy. I didn't order wine, but I glanced in the kitchen when the curtain opened, and I saw that the house wine is Franzia. The service was ok, but not amazing. This is the kind of place that puts a lot of emphasis on presentation, and as a result, everything looked beautiful, but the flavor needed improvement. I arrived hungry, and left not hungry, but I'm not in a hurry to go back. I did not go with the AYCE option, so I can't comment on that, but overall, I was not impressed.",

Don't get me wrong the restaurant is very clean and it's a nice atmosphere for dinner or to have a relaxed lunch . Heck every roll I had, was very well presented. They looked very well prepared, however when it came down to business , to me it was a disappointment. All that color, all that elegance and presentation of the roll , lacked in the taste of the roll. It was like Trey Gowdy trying to find Clinton's \"Deleted emails\" the taste was just not there.",

We came in around closing time (rude I know,) but Daniel still gave us amazing service! Extremely polite and could remember all of my specific requests on my rolls without having to ask again. Definitely give this place a try, and if you get Daniel as your waiter then you are definitely in luck!!!",

    "text": "This is by far my favorite AYCE sushi restaurant in Las Vegas. I have eaten at a number of both medium and high end sushi restaurants in Vegas and this is the only one I continue coming back to.   The menu is extremely extensive with everything you could want from nigiri, rolls, beef tataki, and even yellowtail and salmon collar. I even have a friend who doesn't eat raw fish and he loves this place and is able to easily fill up. While there are certainly some plates I like much better than others, even the dishes I don't care for were worth trying (especially since it's all you can eat).  The service can be hit or miss. They are never rude, but can take a little longer than you'd like especially if they are busy. But when I eat sushi I am rarely in a hurry so this doesn't bother me.   As this is one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas, I have tried a large number of their dishes. I would highly recommend the SALMON COLLAR! I avoided it for the longest time because I didn't really know what it was. Finally a friend said I had to try it and from that point on my AYCE dinner will never be complete without it. Aside from the traditional rolls and nigiri, I would also suggest the tuna poke salad, seafood salad, spicy tuna salad, beef tataki, pork belly, rock and roll, orange blossom roll, and the honey toast for dessert.   Always a great experience.",

My friends and I love sushi and we are always arguing which one to go to. I 100% of the time say let's go to Kaizen and normally get my way.  So when we arrived it wasn't busy at all.  It was picking up cause we got there right around 4:45pm for the AYCE dinner special.  I placed my order and then did my friend.  Surprisingly my friends rolls kept coming out and none of mine had.  Finally 1 of the 4 I ordered came out at this time my friend was being served his last roll that he ordered.  I inquired about mine and they said they are coming.. keep in mind at least (30 min) has passed since ordering.  Finally 2 of my other rolls came out and still missing 1 more roll.  I enjoyed what was made how ever it was the most sloppiest made roll and you could tell they were thrown together cause they forgot to make them.  As I am finishing what was brought to me our waitress cute white girl with tattoos who was friendly asked if we wanted dessert. I explained I'm still missing 1 more roll.  She peeked over the sushi bar and looked at me and I just said never mind. My friend ordered dessert and we asked for our checks.  Knowing my frustration and lack of service nothing was done to rectify below par service we received yesterday.  I've always loved this place but if yesterday's service / food was any indication of the future this place is a sinking ship :(",

The oysters, white tuna, BBQ shirt ribs and hamachi Kama are just a few of our favorites. The thing that really makes this place awesome is the service. We've been there too many times than I can remember and we always have Wei and Pear serving us. They are awesome and always taking care of us. It sad to hear that Wei is no longer there, but are so thankful we still get to see Pear!!! The icing on the cake is that they have a punch card so you get a stamp for every all you can eat person in your party. Once you get 10 stamps, the 11th one is free!!! Who doesn't love a free all you can eat sushi meal!!!",

One of our kids ordered chicken teriyaki, he said it wasn't as good as usual. And we looked at it, they must be using popcorn chicken now instead of breasts. It took about 30 min to come out and we ordered it as soon as we sat down. Sorry, kaizen, we used to come every week...we're looking for a new AYCE spot.",

I am pretty picky about my Japanese food and sushi, and my husband is a vegetarian so there's not usually stuff at sushi places he can really eat. That having been said... This place is just great.  Small nice restaurant, good vibe and atmosphere, great food, friendly and prompt service, food is fresh.  They had lots of stuff my vegetarian husband could eat, and they even make custom rolls.  He told me that's the best time he's ever had at a sushi place with me, because usually everyone eats sushi (with fish) and there's not much for him to choose from.  He shared a custom vegetarian roll, a shiitake mushroom roll, ramen noodles, and an egg roll with another vegetarian friend.  They have tons of rolls to choose from, the staff were all super nice.  They were packed, but we were still well taken care of.  Prices are very reasonable, the all you can eat deal is amazing.  I love it.  We're planning on visiting whenever we're in NV again.",

I've seen a lot of servers walking back and forth not really doing anything. Only the guy that took our drink orders was very friendly but other than that I don't think I would ever come back here. It wasn't even busy so I wasn't sure why there was such a long wait on our table. Talking from a servers point of view because I am one, you should always greet your table & tell them you will be right with them but I've never had this bad of experience in my life.",

    "text": "After a long day of work, the girl and I needed some good eats. There's not a lot of places open at 2am in the morning.  However, you best believe that Kaizen will satisfy your late night munchies with some flare.   The crowd was most definitely people coming out from either the bars or looking to have some drinks/sushi.   We were seated at the bar and began with some salmon and yellowtail sashimi.      - hell yeah. Exactly what i needed. Fresh, marbly, and delicious. Squeeze some lemons and oh, ask for fresh wasabi if you're like me and like that shot to the nose.   Then got some unagi sushi. Cause I love eel. Get that libido up gents.        - Love it cause it's all warm on top of the rice and the perfect amount of eel sauce. Some places really drown it with the sauce but not Kaizen.  Proceeded next with some Spider hand rolls.         - What makes a good spider hand roll? The crab is fresh and crispy when bitten into. That crunch. Yass.   Ended off our minimal courses with a roll which I forgot the name of D; but there was shrimp tempura, soft shell crab tempura, crab meat, & rainbow colored roe?? Anyways bomb :)  Definitely will be returning soon",

They even offer toro(fatty tuna) but that's only one order per AYCE customer.  Their rolls are also pretty good. They have a wide selection and they are all very well made. They also have specialty rolls such as the OMG and I love my ass roll. (Both pretty good)  They also have a lot of appetizers to choose from. Definitely more than any other AYCE sushi place I've ever been to. If you go you absolutely HAVE TO TRY THE PORK BELLY. Absolutely delicious. (Also only 1 per AYCE customer)  Only negative I have for this place is that they are a little slow but good food takes time and love :)",

I did like the Korean BBQ sushi roll with the extra BBQ meat on the side, but if I'm craving Korean BBQ I'd just go to a Korean restaurant. I also got the \"I like my a**\" roll as I'd read about it here on Yelp, but again I just wasn't impressed. It was good, but not as good as other specialty rolls I've had. And I couldn't find a smoked salmon-cream cheese roll (one of my favorites) on the menu. Overall, I guess it just didn't compare to my favorite sushi restaurants.",

    "text": "Kaizen rocks.  The decor is cool and the place is intimate.  They play a little acid jazz along with house and garage.  The ambiance is cool.  The staff is really good.  While the Kaizen appears to have few customers, it could be my new go-to place.  The sushi was awesome.  Toro and tako were fantastic.  The fish was as fresh and tender as any I've had in Vegas.  The rolls were imaginitive and tasty.  We landed on a great night, as it was two for one drinks night.  I highly recommend Kaizen.",

    "text": "I  am very picky with sushi, as I'm not a fan of many different types of raw fish (salmon/tuna/eel/etc) however, my husband and I came here last week to try their all you can eat and I was thoroughly impressed! Nigiri that I ordered was fresh, and came quickly, and my husband loved what he ordered as well. Personal favorite roll was the crazy girl. Their shrimp tempura was also DELISH! :-) then before leaving, they gave us a coupon for $12 off our next AYCE visit. Great staff!",

    "text": "This is my husband and my favorite sushi joint besides Nobu! The price is amazingly reasonable and the variety is extensive. Overall the dishes come fresh, well prepared, and worth the cost. We usually eat about $150+ worth of sushi so the \"All You Can Eat\" is remarkably priced for what we consume. I think it's the best reasonably priced sushi joint here in Las Vegas.",

    "text": "Tried this place for the first time tonight with four other friends and everyone loved it. We have been to numerous sushi places around tow. And defiantly would rate this in the top 3. All of us did the all you can eat, which includes access to a sushi salad bar they have which is very good. We had numerous roles and I recommend trying the ice cream in your mouth and the banana role. Both is something you must try, I did t think I was going to like it but we all decided to try it and all of us liked both of them so much we had to order more. The selection of roles was quite large and all of them were very tasty. I strongly recommend this place to anyone who is a sushi lover, I'd give it a 6 out of 5 stars.",

    "text": "This place doesn't even deserve one star!  I guess people are clueless when it comes to what \"good sushi\" really is!  Ordered the spicey tuna rolls and they were absolutely disgusting!  So bitter, mushy and nastey tasting!  Definitely was not fresh at all!!!!!  We couldn't even eat them and sent them back.  Waitress was the worst server I've ever encountered!  She threatened to charge us EXTRA for the tuna rolls we sent back!  We all paid for the AYCE and it wasn't worth it!  So then we ordered a couple more different rolls hoping they would be better.  Chose not to get anything with tuna because the tuna was disgusting.  So we had some different rolls with crab.  Turns out...THEIR CRAB IS IMMITATION CRAB!!!!!  It was just as disgusting as the tuna!  Then we had to wait almost 30 minutes for our server to come back to our table to bring us our order after we sent back the tuna!  I'm telling you....do not waste your money going here!  They treat you like s**t and the food is horrific!  I seriously don't know what they were trying to serve people here.  The table directly behind us sent their food back as well and complained to the waitress for pathetic service and fake crab.  They also said they'd never be back again.  We ended up leaving and going elsewhere.  I sure would like to see what the health dept. finds when they come into this place!  It's absolutely the worst sushi and service I've ever had in my life!",
