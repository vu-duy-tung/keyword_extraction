Of course the portions are served family style which feeds 3 or more people (so order accordingly! It's very easy to over order!). Our group ordered the stuffed chicken and the fettuccine supremo. This way more than enough for light eaters in a group of four. The stuffed chicken is AMAZING which I would suggest to any person who decides to come here. It has a great crunchy outer breading and inside the chicken is super tender and full of flavor in addition to the ham and the creamed filling. Super delish! The fettuccine supremo was also good. What you would expect of a typical pasta. The sauce was thick and creamy and filled with helpings of bell peppers and sausage.  They also offer happy hour which is $2 domestic, $3 imports, $5 glass of wine and specialty drinks at the bar only. Their house wine is ok. They offer a sample tasting of it, but honestly, it's a little boring and dry to me. I opted for their moscato instead which was light and sweet. Service was also ok. Our server was attentive as he could be in a busy restaurant, but he did satisfy all of our needs.",

We had a great experience last time and really enjoyed the food.  It is also my husband's birthday today! We planned on ordering big and enjoying some Italian food! We ordered a small family style baked ziti, a small family style stuffed chicken,and a small family style bread. Our server was really nice and attentive, but I wish he would of brought the food out to us as well. There was a different young man who brought us our food. This young man made it a point to  \"wish us luck\" for ordering such a large amount of food. It was embarrassing and put a damper on the meal. My husband and I really enjoy the food here, but we feel that management should encourage their staff not to patronize customers, but to encourage customers to enjoy their selections. It's common to indulge when on vacation, and I doubt the Buca corporation would be happy hear that employees are discouraging vacationers for indulging on their wonderful entrees. By the way the food was excellent. We ate almost everything and took a small amount in a to go container back to the room for later!",

I'm usually a big fan of Buca Di Beppo - foodwise, count me in - but when the overall dining experience isn't up to par with what is expected, I am forced to lower down the rating a notch.   My parents and I came here a late Mother's Day lunch and ordered a small chicken carbonara, small calamari as well as the garlic pepper broccoli. Our waiter had great sales talk about items on the menu, however, at some point, he started to feel a little pushy. When we weren't even done with our dishes, he came up and asked if we wanted a box for our carbonara of if we wanted it taken away already, when there were still some calamari left on the plate, he took it away without asking...and my parents and I were left staring at each other in uncomfortable silence as he walked away.   Other than that, the food was awesome. Carbonara filled us up to the brim, we didn't have room for dessert although that tiramisu sample our waiter showed us looked prettttyyyyy tasty. I also highly appreciate the photo service with complimentary postcards per table - with optional bigger photos for about $5 if I remember well. Music was really chill and the atmosphere didn't feel as intimate as the Paradise branch. So that's a 3/5, nothing more, nothing less.",

The Spicy rigatoni was delicious even with the peas. We ordered the smaller portions for a family of four and it did the job. I recommend the large serving of the cheesy Florentine bread. The margaritas were sweet and light on the liquor.  Service: The hostesses in the front were chatty and a bit rude, they kept turning their backs to converse and laugh, they rolled their eyes at people walking by them. The waiter was friendly, and attentive.  Restaurant: Large and a bit dated, but I think they intentionally have it this way because of their focus to \"old Italy\".

    "text": "We were craving chicken Marsala so we decided to visit one of our favorite places. However it was a mistake to come to the Buca Di Beppo located inside Excalibur.   1. We called to see if we can make a reservation for four  and check on wait time but the receptionist hung up on us. That should have been our first clue. 2. We had to pay $8 for 4 hour parking at the casino parking lot.  3. On a Monday night, 7pm, after 20 minutes of waiting, they seated us at a booth where we almost fell because the cushion wouldn't stay in place. There was a big rip in one of the cushions. The hostess/waitress had to fix it 4 times. We asked for a different table and the waitress/hostess insisted that it was fixed unless we wanted to wait some more. This booth was located in the corner next to the railing -as soon as you walk in to the restaurant turn right.  4. My mom ordered coffee. She never got the sugar until we asked repeatedly.  5. The $30+ trio appetizer was over priced. Shrimps were delicious but the calamari were over fried and stale. Def not worth the money for the quality and quantity.  6. The Marsala pasta was disgusting and we had to send it back. It was overly sweet lacking the texture of a sauce consistency. Like someone just pour the Marsala wine on the pasta as an after thought. Waiter said that's just how they make it. The sauce was pre-made and they just pour the liquid on the pasta.  7.  One of the waiters decided to hop over the railing as we were sitting there instead of going around to use the ramp access. He almost fell in the process. Very unprofessional. He could have hit my mom in the process.  8. Overall, we had to ask for our refills, the condiments, and basically everything. Unknown if it was a staffing issue or what, but my parents and I will not be coming to this location. That $120.00 was a waste of money for unsavory food, poor service and unstable cushion with a rip on it.  We never had issues with other Buca restaurants.",

    "text": "I haven't been to Buca di Beppo in years, and I recently had the opportunity to eat at this restaurant with my friends here in Vegas.  From the moment you walk into the restaurant, there is tons of excitement and energy!  Love it!   First, you have to set expectations before eating here and writing a review - it is a family style restaurant that caters to large groups.   This is not a James Beard Award Winning restaurant, but it is a fun place for groups to grab a meal together.  I called in to make a reservation for 8 people at 7:00 p.m. and Miss Hostess was the nicest person I've encountered in a long time!  Easy Peasy!  When we got to the restaurant, we were greeted by three lovely hostesses.  We were told to wait 5 minutes for them to set up our table (HUH?  The restaurant was half empty!).  After being seated, we were quickly greeted and served by lovely Miss Server Shennae!  For starters, we got the Apple Gorgonzola Salad (Small for 4).  The salad was your typical green salad but was loaded with gorgonzola cheese, thinly sliced Granny Apples, walnuts and cranberries.  It was light, fresh, and tasty!   Grade:  B  For the main dish, we got the Frutti di Mare Pasta (Small for 4).  The pasta was topped with mussels, clams, shrimp, and calamari.   The pasa noodles were tossed with a rich and spicy marinara sauce.  I loved the taste of this dish.  I didn't like the texture of the noodles.  It tasted like either the noodles were over cooked or were a cheap brand of noodles.  The texture was mushy and did not have a chew to it like most noodles should have.    Grade:  B-  The kiddos at the table ordered from the kid's menu ($5!).  Each had a personalized sized cheese pizza or spaghetti and meatballs.  Both selections were VERY generous and large!  The pizzas were 9\" across.  The spaghetti and meatballs was served in a medium sized pasta bowl and looked like it was enough for 2 adults.   (It looked so tasty, I wanted to eat the leftovers of the kids, but I refrained!).   Grade:  A!  Best part of the meal was the energy and smiles of Miss Server Shennae!  She was patient and really made it an enjoyable evening!  You can tell she loves her job!  Thanks a bunch, Shennae!  Food Grade:  B Service Grade:  A! Worth the Money Grade:  B-  (sorry, the bad pasta noodles and prices did this) Overall Impression Grade:  B",

I tried the Peony which is similar to a sex on the beach. For 13.99 you get to keep the glass as a souvenir   awesome isn't it? Yes! The waiter was kind, attentive and friendly. I was surprised with the colossal brownie as the team sung happy birthday and blew out a candelabra. AMAZING!! I LOVE THIS PLACE!  (Only downfall were two screaming kids)",

My friend and I were in the area the other day because we had a show to watch. She wanted pasta, and Olive Garden was too far. We went to Buca di Beppo, and the prices were expensive! It did say that the small portions would serve 2 or more people, so we shared a dish. We had chicken cannolini- a stuffed dish with chicken and cheese and spinach.   They did come with bread and butter. Our bread was cold. It would have tasted much better if our bread was piping hot. Since I was starving, I stuffed myself with bread. When our stuffed pasta came out, there was only 4 pieces. I was kind of shocked because they said portions are large. I had 2 pieces and my friend had 2 as well. I was still hungry after eating. I don't eat much either. It was $24, which was definitely not worth it. Some of the other dishes might have bigger portions, but when you purchase meat, you get way less food? The pasta itself was delicious.",

We were pretty loud (mostly me), but our waiter was super awesome in working with us and recommending stuff. He was super nice and took great care of us.   Service was a little slow, which is understandable with a group of our size.   Here's what I shared with three other people:  Artichoke Florentine Dip- super yummy with crunchy little bread slices, plenty for 4 Baked Ziti (Large)- loved the ricotta, PLENTY for 4, enough for 5 regular people without monster-appetites   Turns out to be pretty affordable if you come in a group and you don't mind all eating the same thing.  I also had a few drinks, so don't judge me. Be happy I can offer so much review!   Also, the drink menu isn't online (except for the wine, which doesn't help me), so the names are what I can remember, which isn't correlated with the fact that I had about 4 drinks...  Cheap Red (just ask for their cheap red), 9 oz.- good about for 2-3 people to share Blended (something) Margarita- pretty delicious Red Sangria- sweet and yummy! Comes with an orange slice and cherry  Overall, great for groups, or a first date. :]",

I put our name in and was told that it would take twenty minutes to be seated; it ended up taking thirty.  The service was okay if you were paying $30-40 for a meal. We ordered a small gorgonzola salad, a small pepperoni pizza, a small chicken saltimbocca, garlic mashed potatoes and two (plastic) glasses of water. This meal came to $82 without counting tip!  The salad was okay, the pizza was very salty and flat, the chicken was average, there was not much garlic taste to the mashed potatoes and the water was chlorinated with not even a lemon wedge to mask the taste.  Their \"family-style\" philosophy forces you into sharing entrees rather than ordering your own meal. You see, the small portions are supposed to be shared. So I guess people who are dining alone are not welcome.  The service was surly and polite. Take your money and go to Olive Garden.",

We were then not given the bread basket, either. Then after we order, they burnt our 4 year olds pizza, and forgot to tell us. So it took forever to get a new  one, and by then we were done eating. They took about 33% off the bill but what a crappy dining experience. This place is clearly in business due to its high foot traffic location, not quality. And btw, my 4 y.o. is still hungry.",

We didn't want much since we had tournament of the kings tickets for that night and I heard they serve a lot of food.  I mean what's a better place to share a plate than Buca di Beppo right? Isn't that what their restaurant based on.   We came and the restaurant had maybe 4 customers in there, we still had to wait 10 minutes for a table that was ok not really a problem. We were seated and the waiter came looked at my kids and his mood changed completely he was so rude!! My kids were seated nicely no peep out of them so that wasn't the problem he must have just not liked kids, anyway so we order our food and drinks he had an issue with our order because my husband and I wanted to split a lunch size plate and my kids split the spaghetti and meatballs (my son is 1 how much is he really going to eat) after that he was horrible! I mean I would have paid a split plate fee to avoid his horrible service. He brought out the bread and didn't offer oil and vinegar but he brought it and was very attentive to the table that was ordering a couple plates. The hostess had to serve our table because he wanted nothing to do with us (I'm thinking because of the tip size with a lower bill) I'm actually a really good tipper being a former server so I wouldn't tip based on the bill anyway.   He never checked on us again.   My daughter ordered the Pisa punch with the light up cup and she had to yell EXCUSE ME!!! To get the guys attention when she asked for a refill he said we had to pay for a refill I told him that was okay go ahead and get her more he took her cup and brought her another but charged me for 2 cups with punch not just the refill  that's fine but since I paid for the cup can I have it lol!  In the end he was a major damper on our fun filled amazing day in Vegas.  We go to 2 Buca locations in SoCal and love them but I don't think I will be a customer anymore if Buca allows their establishments to be run that way in any state.",

    "text": "I've had Bucca Di Peppo as catering before, it was just OK.   We decided on Italian and since Bucca Di Peppo was in the hotel we were staying at, there was a 30 minute wait (Saturday night)  So we walked over to one of the gift shops and bought a few things for the kids while we waited. Once seated our orders were taken quickly, my drink was delivered quickly and the waiter explained how big the portions were and took the time to give recommendations for us.  I am blown away. Yes it was busy,  but our server was SUPER attentive, he came by 7 times, checking on my drink, if the food was good, but not in a rushing or pushy way, he was just passing by and would check on us.  The food was fantastic! We had meatballs (the pasta was the only thing lacking, it was WAY over cooked, and watery in the bottom of the bowl) But the meatballs were AMAZING and then we also got chicken stuffed with cheese and prosciutto, we got potatoes as a side. I'm so glad that we tried this place. I got lemon basil vojitos and which were PERFECT!  There was a lot of food, and we couldn't finish the left over which we didn't take because we were in a hotel but it was worth it. Since we have one here in the area we live in, I think we will take the kids next time, its SO worth it to go sit down and enjoy it all fresh.",

My friends and I agreed on the dishes we were gonna share beforehand and ordered the second we sat down, also letting the waiter know that we'd appreciate the check ASAP as we have tickets for the 11pm show next door ;-p We ordered the my standard spaghetti frutti di mare which was delicious and seafood-filled as always, and a salad.  After paying our check, we left the restaurant and realized that we were so efficient with dinner that we still had time to kill! We spotted a happy hour which offered $5 sangria, so naturally we went. We then realized that we're just in the bar area of the the restaurant. The sangria glasses were huge and it was delicious.  I wouldn't go out of my way to come here (Excalibur eek), but good option for dinner if you are at this end of the strip for some reason",

I took my daughter who was visiting to Buca for Mother's Day and it was such a big disappointment.  We shared a couple of the meatballs (very dry)and a  shared a Caprese salad.  A new item was a Bruschetta dish which was served in a tall martini glass, which was not at all fresh with stale toast on the side and soggy croutons and unappetizing cheese remnants.  We tasted it and did not eat it.  We did not have drinks or dessert but I left a big tip (the bill was over $100) and did not complain as I did not want to spoil our time together.  We have been there many times but, sadly,we will not return.",

Our server was pleasant & we \"over all\" had a nice time dinning here. However, Felt it's a little pricey for what it's worth.. FYI- they do offer kids meals for 10 & under too! :)",

We went with the Spaghetti and Meatballs (\"our famous half-pound meatballs with our homemade marinara sauce\") as our main and it was, to put it mildly, a disappointment.  The food arrived at the table hardly hotter than warm, but that wasn't the biggest problem. No, the main issue was the unbelievably overcooked pasta. It was soft and mushy and I couldn't believe a restaurant would serve something of this caliber. The meatballs were tough and dry, while the marinara sauce was bland and tasteless.  Our side dish, Italian Broccoli Romano, was surprisingly tasty, though. The broccoli had a nice crunch, and the impressively plentiful garlic gave the dish an irresistible bite.  I probably wouldn't have found the main so objectionable if it hadn't been so expensive ($26.99!)",

Then the server (the worst server I've ever seen) comes and says \"I have 3 tables before you so if you want to wait\" In other words you better leave is what he tried to sah right? I call the manager and he backs the server up saying he is not like that WOW this is definitely not the service that a restaurant at the MGM corporation should have. This happened today October 9th at 3 pm. I hope somebody takes care of these people who don't have any idea what customer service is",

We ate here for dinner AFTER ( they're open to midnight)  the Tournament of Kings.  They never fail to impress. We might have been the only ones there that it's more expensive at home than Vegas.  We managed to feed an entire family for about $100, yes 9 of us ( do 3 yr olds count?).  It's located on the third level of the Excalibur hotel which made it really convenient.  The service was fantastic !  Unlike most Bucas, this restaurant featured an open concept making it much brighter than usual. LOVE the bread",

We ordered the supreme Alfredo and the bowl measured 12\" x 6\" deep and was completely full with great tasting pasta.    It's easy to find and located inside Excalibur Casino.  Our server was attentive and very friendly, and in addition we were checked on by two managers.  The appetizer was super quick and the main course was brought out as soon as we finished.  The atmosphere is made up of several different Italian themed rooms with pictures covering every inch of the walls.  The only minuses to this location is the lack of a table in the kitchen -if you haven't sat at this \"special\" table in other locations do it!- and the bathrooms are out in the casino.    As for the pricing, well it's on the strip but still within $5, per item, of their off strip location here in Vegas. Last, I HIGHLY recommend making reservations as the stand by wait was 90 minutes...OUCH!",

Mandy was instrumental in getting us a table for a large party at late notice, and our server Randi was amazing! When we arrived, there was already bread and salad on the table and the food arrived soon after.  The players and the parents on the team were very happy with the dinner! Buca even made it special by celebrating 2 of the players' birthdays! Thank you Buca for a wonderful team dinner!",

Salad were placed on the tables right before we sat down. A caesar salad and a house salad with Italian dressing. We were served Fettuccine Alfredo, Spaghetti with a meat sauce, Chicken Parm and cheesecake for dessert.  The dishes were good. The only thing I didn't like was the cheesecake, it tasted like it was frozen for a while.   The service was great. Drinks were great. Atmosphere was perfect.",

    "text": "Was there on the Eve of Wednesday June 28th. Dinner was going well with the family up until we saw the check. The waiter had charged us an extra soda and an extra tea. Originally the waiter had brought us a second round of soda and tea, we didn't ask for them as our drinks were barely sipped. I thought it was complimentary because I had turned the waiter down, but he insisted on keeping the drinks at the table in case anyone else wanted it. No one else at the table wanted it because they all drank water. I'm not sure if the waiter had good intentions or not, but maybe learn to ask your patrons before assuming they want more drinks? In my opinion, this was a small scam to make more money for the restaurant and make more money towards the waiter's gratuity since it was a party of 8 and the bill was pretty hefty.  On a positive note, this was my third time eating there and the portions are large. I'm not sure why other people are complaining about prices at restaurants on the LV strip for when you can have a large bowl of spaghetti for $30 that serves 5 or go to the snack bar and order a sandwhich for $15 that serves 1. If you have a large party, this is the place to go, food is good and service is great. Just watch your bill and turn down those \"extra\" drinks they bring to you because they aren't complimentary.",

The Caesar salad was absolutely the best I have ever had don't know what they do but they need to keep doing. I ordered chicken Parmesan, figured hey this is an Italian place in must be good. Unfortunately it was probably the blandest chicken that I have ever had in my life. No flavor, marinara sauce was mediocre. Service was OK, but the food was not worth going back for again.",

The service was ok, we got the bread with our dinner but not prior so not something to munch on while your waiting for your food. I would again say it's not bad but not great.For the price of the food and the quality you can find in Vegas I would not recommend this restaurant nor will I be returning.",

We booked a Thanksgiving reservation ahead although, it wasn't needed. We showed up at 1:30 and there were maybe 2 other families in the entire restaurant. The wait staff were really great! Very friendly and super fast service. We had a traditional Thanksgiving meal for 3. We are a family of 4 and decided to order a side of pasta as well. This was VERY much unnecessary. The portions were huge!!! Even with 4 of us we took a ton of leftovers. It all turned out really delicious! We love Buca di Beppo's anyway. But they were on point for a Thanksgiving meal as well! Highly recommended. Great experience!",

Buca di Beppo is inside the Excalibur Hotel complex and offers 'family sized' Italian meals - that means for us Brits that the portions are big. We had the large Pepperoni which was too big for three of us with a few slices remaining on the board. The pizza was thin crust and the pepperoni was quite tasty but the tomato sauce was a bit insipid.  Drinks are on permanent happy hour so we could get a Light Beer for just $3 a glass.   There was a little issue with initially getting served but this was due to the bar area only being covered by one person at 8:30pm. When we were served though the guy was great and looked after us really well, making recommendations to save money.  Bearing in mind it's inside a hotel it's a good bargain and acceptable for a quick snack.",

Now on to the food, for an appetizer we ordered the bruschetta which was amazing full of flavor we both loved it! Our main course was Frutti de mare pasta which i highly recommend for seafood lovers, we ordered the small portion which is huge it feeds 2-3 people we had a lot left over. Dessert we had Tiramisu which was probably my favorite by far that i've had very creamy and perfectly made.",

Random story, my husband was looking for a bar table so we could eat sooner and he found one completely empty. A few minutes after we sat down, some guys told us it was there table and they had just gone to get some drinks. We didn't want to cause a scene so we left. But wouldn't you assume they should have at least left one person or an item at the table to save it? How were we supposed to know?  Anyways.. we eventually were seated at an actual table. Our server seemed stressed out and a little annoyed with life. We ordered and then asked for some bread and he kind of snapped that it was coming. Many restraunts now only bring bread if you request it which is why we asked, not because we were impatient. We didn't see much of our server but he did warm up a little over the course of our dinner. He brought us the wrong bill at first (much more expensive then our bill so we were glad we caught it)  The prices here were higher then I have seen at other Buca locations. We had a seafood pasta that was really good. Food is always pretty consistently tasty at Buca. I would have given a 4 star if the waiter was friendlier.",

From the excellent wine selection, a variety of appetizers, and traditional Italian Pastas and Entrees, it was a feast my Italian Grandmother would have been proud of! It was all capped off by excellence serve from our wonderful Server, Hector!  He was attentive, extremely friendly and stayed on top of our entire party from the moment we entered the restaurant until we left.  The restaurant is under the management of David Gordon and my Paisan, Joe Bellefontaine. They were quick to accommodate my group on a busy week in the middle of CES!  No easy feat.   I have had the pleasure of dinning here quite frequently and they never disappoint.  Great Food, Wonderful Service and always accommodating, whether I'm have quiet dinner with a few friends, or with a large group. They certainly know how to do it.  Thank You David, Joe, Hector and the entire Team at Bucca di Beppo, you guys Rock It!!",

The reason they got 2 stars was our waiter Victor! He was truly awful.... worst service I've had in Vegas.

Of course he was the friendliest when he brought the check, gotta make sure you smile for that tip right? Well, he dropped it off and I told him I had a coupon, he hands me a pen to write down the code and walks away, 10 minutes later he shows up to apply the coupon, another 10 minutes go by and we get the final check after waiting 20 minutes, I put cash in and left.

So, when I saw this one at Excalibur, I jumped at the chance to check it out for my birthday dinner. I made a reservation over the phone. That was easy enough. When we got there, I was surprised at how many open tables they had. I guess it's Vegas and people eat dinner later, if they even eat. We got a nice comfy booth with a good view of the restaurant. We had a good server (for the most part). We ordered a caprese salad and chicken parmesan dinner. It was a lot for 2 of us but we still handled it. The food was made quickly and it was not the best chicken parm I ever had but I had no complaints about food. The only issue I came across, during our whole dinner was related to the service. When we finished our appetizer, we sat there for about 15 min with empty, dirty plates on the table. We kept pushing them further away from us because a lot of different servers (including ours) kept walking by. They were walking fast but not too fast to smile and make eye contact. Some of them even looked at the plates on the table and just kept walking. Then, our food arrived. Our server moved the dirty plates over and put our food down next to them. And he left the dirty dishes there. That really happened. I have never had a server touch a dirty plate other than to pick it up and take it away. Was I being Punkd? possibly. It was, at that point, comical. Like WTF? Eventually someone came by while we were eating and picked it up. It wasn't a deal breaker but it was pretty annoying. Other than that, I enjoyed my dinner and our server was friendly. Prices were reasonable, reservations were not really needed for a Fri night and the location was convenient.",

    "text": "Nice atmosphere. Fairly friendly staff. Terrible food in excessively large portions. The 1st problem I had was that they only offer 2 sizes. A small which feeds 3 & a large which feeds 5 so my husband & I were forced to order the same thing because they refused our request  to order single portions (as you know, the strip hotels do not have fridges in the rooms for left overs). We decided to have the spaghetti & meatballs. It was mushy over cooked spaghetti with very bland & flavorless tomato sauce. It came with 2 huge meatballs that would have been decent if it werent for whole cloves of garlic (some with the peeling still on). It was served with a loaf of bread & butter which was good but when you eat Italian, you kind of expect garlic bread or breadsticks. I will not go back to this restaurant.",

We mainly made the decision to go there because we wanted a quality pizza that would hold us over till dinner. They serve large helpings of food in all their dishes.  Having had some of the best authentic Italian pizzas in both the US and from Europe, the quality was basically in my opinion the same as your local supermarkets frozen brands. Based on the taste and price, it was overall a 2 star experience.",

    "text": "This is an update from September 10th, the owner or manager of this Bucca contacted me and gave an sincere apology for what happened, I explained to him what have happened and tried fixing it. So i decided to give Bucca another shot here in Fullerton, California. Here's what i liked and disliked.  Liked: * The service was 10x more better here, with more customer interaction and little jokes here and there. * The environment was a little more Family Oriented which I really like.  * So much more friendlier staff that aren't looking like they hate their jobs.  * Way better pasta, the one I got in Vegas was a bit bland.  * The food proportion are HUGE, which i like, if I'm paying 22$ for a \"Small\" it better be good.  Disliked:  * Everything came out really slow like, I was waiting a bit just to get a water refill. * Some of these foods need a little more flavor, for example , I order the mozzarella garlic bread, it was good when i bit into it, but when i dipped it in my pasta sauce it was 100x more better, things like bread need a bit of sauce on the side to enhance the flavor.  Over all it was a hell of a lot better experience I had in Nevada, Hopefully this review helps and lets this business learn from its mistakes and strives to make this restaurant a better place for all if its customers, Remember Bucca \"Customer Is The Number 1 Priority!\"",

For my husband and I, we would usually each get something different and share. The way the ordering works here, we can't.  Lasagna is usually a winner at Italian restaurants, but this was disappointing. The sauce lacked depth and overall, it didn't have the indulgence usually part of the baked pasta experience. The garlic bread was also just mediocre.  In the end, I felt like I wasted calories. Not a good thing in Sin City.",

Second time we'll it was just horrible we were seated at a table when we had asked for a booth. When we had questioned the waiter he went to the kitchen to ask his Co worker is he'd take us in his section where the booths were. We were hearing them argue that one didn't want to take care of us and neither did the other!  At this point we're were frustrated and starving so we waited until the waiter came back to tell us he will be helping is even tho its not his section.  Once we received our food all of our pastas were extremely hot on the outside and the top layer but once you dig right in it was all cold! Unbelievably we stayed and ate what was hot and left . I would not recommend this location. Wish I remember the waiters name! Horrible service and food!!",

The host was friendly and welcoming when we first walked in. A manager was also standing at the host stand and warmly welcomed us. We were immediately seated at a comfortable table with good ambiance.   Our server, Sherrae, came right over to the table and offered some specialty cocktails. She also suggested the bruschetta as a starter. Our drinks were delivered promptly. The bruschetta came to the table and we devoured it. It was beyond amazing. Fresh tomatoes and mozzarella were plentiful.   Sherrae checked on our bruschetta to insure we were happy with her suggestion which we were! We then ordered our entree which is served family style so we shared a chicken Parmesan and a ravioli with marinara. The food came out to the table quickly and we were able to enjoy our meal. Sherrae really cares about going above and beyond to enhance the dining experience. We never once had to ask for anything. She anticipated our needs and she made sure that we had everything we needed.   About 3/4 of the way through our meal, the manager, Raymond, stopped by our table to ask if we had everything we needed and if we were enjoying our food. Raymond was very pleasant and we really appreciated the fact that he took the time to stop by the table and check on everything.   Overall, friendly and attentive staff and good, Americanized Italian food!",

We called a month and advance and asked if they would put their cream lemon cake on hold for us because that would be our wedding cake. we told them the quantity how many we needed and asked for them to put a note on our reservation. First off, when we called to put on this request the woman on the phone was extremely rude and told us \"we have big parties all the time we'll have enough cake\".  Now that's fast forward to the wedding day. We get there and have a party of 20 people. Our bill was over $1000 and we only had one server. Overall the service throughout the dinner was poor and slow and the waiter was extremely rude. When you would request something he would say \"I don't have time for that right now I'll get it when I do\". To me that's unacceptable and poor management, if you see you have a party of 20 people assigned more waiters. Then now let's get to the cake. We ordered the cake, the same amount we told The lady on the phone a month ago, and we were told they didn't even have half the amount of pieces that we wanted. We spoke to the manager and he told us that there was no note on our reservation and that pretty much there's nothing he can do. We expressed to him that this is a huge disappointment because this is a wedding cake and he just shrugged his shoulders like he didn't care. No compensation for the poor planning on their end or the upset on our end. After about 15 minutes of us deciding what we should do, he came back and said he \"found cakes in the back but they have been in the freezer\". If you've ever had this cake you'd know it tastes best at room temperature. I'm glad he ended up finding it but considering it wasn't at serving quality and not as good as it would have been if they had been set aside like we asked them to, we were still disappointed. And then we were still charged for the cake!!!   Overall horrible management and organization. When you mess up on a wedding parties order, at least have some empathy with the party. The wedding cake is a big deal and now all we will remember is horrible service we had when we think back on this day and reception. Makes me not even want to go back to the Bucca in my hometown.",

We ordered everything in the small size because it was just two of us so we had way more than enough food. Will definitely be back next time we're in Vegas but will probably invite other people since the portions are made to be shared. Still worth it even if it's just my husband and I.",

Last night was my wife's birthday so we of course went to Buca out of all the EATERIES in Vegas, we sit down order all cool , drinks come and in over an hour not once were we asked for a refill or how anything was I had to ask bus boy for a napkin took forever so I got up and took it from another table after we were done he came by, the to top off the night a couple shows up with a Pitbull sirs down next to us and the pit is there looking at everyone,don't get me wrong I am a dog owner myself, however when my wife dropped her napkin and the pit just looked at her and was kind of intimidating, there is a tine and place for your dog to be with you but damn at a family restaurant is not the place. I am sorry but the whole night was _ ucked, I would hope that any manager there would have the ability to respectfully ask a person not to take a pet to such a nice restaurant and to repeat what crappy service. Today 5/2/19 still have not heard back from Buca went to their website as directed to, looked at a few reviews from one month to mine 3 days ago , from now on my money will be spent elsewhere.",

We were sat right away and advised our server we were heading to a show so we needed to leave at a specific time. We also has a few coupons that we had gotten because we signed up for them last year. Our server dealt with all of this wonderfully.  We ordered a small caesar, a small baked rigatoni with ricotta, and a dessert. The food was so awesome. It was fresh and wonderful. The small portions were big enough for us to share and allow us to leave the resturant full, but not too extremely full.  The dessert we got was called the Mount Vasuvious. It was chocolatey and ice creamy and raspberry sauce covered. Just delicious!  I liked the Italian theme also. I thought the different pictures of popes and Italian people were really interesting. There was nothing negative about this Resturant. They did a really good job and next time I am in Begas, I'll be visiting again for sure.",

For Italian it's a little pricey, but keep in mind that the portions are family size so it's perfect for sharing. We started with the trio appetizer, the baked rigatoni and the stuffed chicken with prosciutto. Now I need to say that I am extremely picky about Italian food being a born and raised New Yorker, but I thought the meal was really good. The sauce for the rigatoni was a little sweeter than I like but the creamy pesto sauce for the chicken was great! Of course my boyfriend preferred the rigatoni to the chicken! Good experience and great service! Also the Excalibur has a killer food court selection so you can grab a Krispy Kreme on the way out! We will be back!",

Eventually we were accomodated and promptly asked \"what is wrong\". I explained we needed more room for the 3 of us. We received our food quickly afterward which the quality and portions were fair.

Difference, it's at the Excalibur in Fabulous Las Vegas! So if you like the same cheesy garlic bread, the same pasta and chicken, then albiet, you'll love this place.  Service was good, especially for the party size we had.  Oh, no walk through the kitchen?! No Kitchen table, and No different rooms. I was so hoping to get the Pope's table. Oh well...",

    "text": "This review is for the Buca in Excalibur casino, I had an early dinner here on a Saturday evening and sat in the bar area off the side of the main restaurant.  Please be aware that the entrees are served family style, I can eat a lot, when I ordered for me and my companion the 'small' size entree's were PLENTY of food to eat.  We tried the 'Small' size calamari for the appetizer, it was very good and perfectly crunchy, for our main entree we had the 'Small' size chicken carbonara.  The food was very good and flavorful, for two of us we didn't finish it and had to take our leftovers with us.  The drinks were good, we had a glass of wine and draft beer with the meal, they do have Happy hour specials here as well.  The only complaint I had was with the 'Small' size of garlic bread we had on the side, the bread was too hard and not very buttery and could barely taste the garlic.  The portion size for the 'small' was huge though, so if you do order the garlic bread, the 'small' size is 16 mid size pieces which was over the top in my opinion for two people.  Overall, the food was good, nice ambiance, and our server was very helpful.  My recommendation for dinner for two, 1 small appetizer and entree should do the trick.  I will definitely try this place again.",

    "text": "Buca do Beppo isn't really an Italian restaurant. It's an Italian-American restaurant which served Americanized versions of Italian dishes. The decor of the restaurant is a throwback to 1950s Italian-American kitsch with red and white checkered vinyl tablecloths on the table, Christmas lights on tacky fake marble statues, memorabilia of the popes everywhere and a photo of Mario Lanza hanging over the urinal. The food is definitely not delicate, featuring heavy breading and dried pasta that stuck together while boiling. I had the veal saltimbocca that was tasty but you couldn't distinguish that you were acting eating veal and Italian ham the breading was so heavy. My side dish of fettuccine Alfredo tasted more like over cooked box pasta with hot cream. Still, the waitress was super friendly and the overall charm of the restaurant went a long way.",

However if you are going in a smaller group such as 2-3 people I would not recommend this place at all and here is why... All the dishes are served family style which means you must all agree on all your selections unless your going to have a lot of left overs and will be left with a large bill at the end which brings me to my next point. If you are in a smaller group and you all don't agree on a dish and you get a something only you will eat you will most likely spend between $20-$35 per dish now if you are if a larger group that's great! I wish this restaurant offered a menu for couples of two with much smaller portions or even a small list of items which you can get just one of and not need to share. If we would have known that this restaurant was only family style we would have not gone here because it was such a waste for us. There is a plus and a nice touch to this restaurant there was a photographer coming to each table and taking a \"free\" photo ( which is the size of a post stamp ) unless you want to spend $25 for one or $30 for two. Overall the atmosphere was great and all the employees were very friendly. Remember if you have a large group this is the place for you!",

As with all Buca's their meals are meant to be shared even the small portions, so that's nice. Their spaghetti and meat balls are not my favorite but I was told by others in my group that for them it was, so I guess it a taste thing. Their salads are good and crispy not soggy and bland like in other restaurants. Had their Prosciutto Stuffed Chicken... delicious, the sauce was on point and the chicken tender and juicy, and the prosciutto (bacon) was crispy but not hard. Also tried the Chicken Saltimbocca... the sauce was different with a tangy kick from the lemon and matched the way the chicken was cooked but it was not my favorite, a little to tangy and lemony for my taste. Their drinks are reasonably priced and they have a good selection of wine. Our waiter was nice and attentive, he definitely earned his tip. Lost one star because you could smell the smoke from the casino and that may have been why I didn't enjoy the food like at a regular Buca.",

The Alfredo had little to no sauce. Super dry. The spaghetti sauce was way to watery. Had no salt whatsoever. The best part of the meal was the garlic bread. By far the nastiest wanna be Italian food I've ever tried and to top it off it gave me really bad indigestion. This was my first time and definitely my last.",

Friendly environment.  At this particular restaurant, our server was kind, fast, and attentive. We never went unnoticed with an empty glass. :) Gave us a brief tutorial on how it works around there. Food servings are large. It's Vegas...a little pricey. But definitely a lot of food. You won't leave here hungry at all.   Drinks were also pretty delicious. I don't know why, but I was kind of surprised. But yeah, our drinks were delicious, good pours, and nice presentation.   So yeah, if you are in the mood for Italian, super hungry, this is definitely a recommended spot. We didn't have any wait times to be seated when we met....it's not the flashiest spot, so, I can imagine it doesn't get super busy here.   We'll definitely come back here when we are in the mood for Italian.",

Merrie had brought out the salads and started to bring out dishes when I asked her again for bread, \"hold on sir\" is what I got; damn. Never got a refill on my drink and no refills unless you flagged her down.   It was not super busy but people that came in after us were getting food first. The kicker was when she forgot one of our \"build your own\" pasta, she completely forgot it. When she rushed it through she made a mistake and added ingredients that some at our table could not eat and would not order but she questioned us as though we made the mistake. Always keeping her horrible attitude.   We finally flagged down another bust boy or helper and he brought bread out right away but we were half way through dinner. Very disappointed in the service because the food is good but if you come out to a restaurant you expect good service. This is not a low cost cafe, There are expectations at Buca and the costs are appropriate for those expectations.",

Our waiter (Victor) was very polite, friendly, and what I love best very informative on the background of the restaurant along with the menu and to top it all off he was always on top of everything making sure our drinks where topped off and our food was coming out in a timely manner. We had our dinner hand delivered by the other manager (Joe) we ordered the (linguine Frutti Di mare) he was very nice as well and even gave us a complimentary dessert(tiramisu).

    "text": "Their dinner portions are meant to be shared among others. Prices vary from 30-40$ and can be split to about 3-5 portions. Lunch special ends at 3PM. I'd recommend coming for lunch specials if you are eating by yourself. Those prices vary from 13$-18$ depending on the entree. I got the spicy chicken rigatoni. 13.49$. Wasn't too spicy but if you can't handle spicy then i would just either make it not spicy or pick another entree. Rigatoni was cooked nicely but the serving size of the chicken was under my expectations. Chicken was also soft too, as it seems like the chicken was cooked with the sauce on a simmer. I personally like chicken when it's pan fried to give it a crispier texture but it wasn't bad.  TL;DR: Would recommend but wouldn't go out of my way to eat here. Come for lunch specials if you're solo.  Thanks for reading",

I go to pick up my order & get there just in time to see the bartender have a meltdown & shout at a waitress, then I get ignored for 5 minutes and he gives me a crappy attitude when I only tip him 4 bucks for just handing me food that was getting cold on the counter next to him. Buca used to have a reputation as a great restaurant but it's apparently been bought out & squeezed by the new investors because the place is frankly horrible now.",

Between the 5 of us, there were still plenty of left overs. About half a plate for both fettuccine and baked ziti. But maybe it's because we weren't really impressed with the food. Really liked the soda though, in all it's strawberry goodness!  Service was on the slow side. We had reservations for 4:00 and arrived on time but still had to wait 10-15mins to get seated. Another few minutes for our server to get our order. The entrees didn't come til 20 minutes or so later and yes, I was timing it 'cause I thought my sister was on some kind of schedule.

I don't know how you're supposed to enjoy your dinner with multicolored lights constantly giving you a headache. Perhaps it's enjoyable for some people (i.e. small children and people who are overly fond of 'busy' decoration), but I'm not one of them. The staff was rude and not really interested in giving you the time of day unless you were ordering copious amounts of alcohol. And the constant barrage of music rolling in from the casino downstairs was just adding insult to injury.   We didn't try the food (so please don't use this review as a basis for that), but we did stop in for one of the \"giant brownie sundaes\". I will give them credit for having one of the largest sundaes I've ever seen. This thing was so big, in fact, that the four people at our table couldn't manage to finish it. The quality was so-so. The \"home-made\" brownie bites seemed more like something you'd get from a grocery store and the ice cream was okay, although I would have liked a better chocolate-to-vanilla ratio.   Price-wise, it's not bad. You could definitely spend a lot more money for better food, but if you're on a budget and you don't mind the gaudy atmosphere and poor service this place may still be a good option for you.",

We decided to take our 5 year old for her birthday and there were many disappointments.  1st, our chicken and pasta dish hardly had any chicken.  I did tell the waiter, and they did bring extra chicken, but the dish overall was just okay for the amount of money they charge.  2)  Maybe this place is only good for big parties, but not so much for 2 1/2 people.  I wanted a little desert and a \"happy birthday song\" to give to my daughter.  I was told they did not have little deserts, that they only had the ones on the menu that we could purchase to go along with their happy birthday song.  The deserts are huge (too big for 2 1/2 people) and the cheapest was 13 dollars, so we didn't purchase one.  They did come and sing happy birthday to her, at the very least they could have given her a little scoop of ice cream (I would have even paid for it), but it was all (an expensive all) or nothing in this case.  My little girl even said \"where is a cake\" after they sang to her.  Note to restaurant, if you have a small party that isn't in the position to get a large and expensive desert for a kids birthday dinner, please have a smaller option or compromise so a little kid does not leave disappointed.",

    "text": "The food was on point with any other Buca di Beppo location.  Not overly sauced pasta, hefty hefty portion.  And the chicken in the chicken Alfredo was cooked to near perfection.  $45 for a heaping bowl that can feed a family of 6 easily is a pretty decent deal when in Vegas.  The di Beppo 1893 salad however for $25 is a rip off.  why 2 stars for good food then?  The service was bad.  We were quickly seated but it took the waiter well over 15 minutes to greet us.  Quick and friendly was his greeting when he finally did arrive.  But once the food was dropped off by the food runner we didn't see him again during the meal, having to ask for refills from other servers.  The guy that came to refill our waters, I asked him if I can place an order of bread with him but he said he'll get the waiter.  Who never came.  When we finished our meal the waiter shows up with the check (never asking who our meal was).  We asked for boxes and that took an additional 15 minutes to bring out even though there was only two other tables in his section.  Instead of getting us boxes and closing out our tab he was cleaning other tables and doing side work.    Good food.  Not so good service.",

We had to order from the banquet menu and our food for 24 included bread, cesar salad, Italian salad, fettuccini alfredo, spaghetti marinara, chicken parmesan and cheesecake.  It was so much food, and quite excellent.  They were more than willing to substitute chocolate cake for my three little picky eaters and made my nieces special day extra special.  The servers were very attentive and we never had to want for anything.  The manager personally oversaw our dinner.  Overall it was an excellent experience that I enjoyed with my wedding party.",

We started off with the di Beppo salad, so fresh and the Italian dressing was so flavorful.  We shared the supreme pizza and WOW, large topping, super fresh ingredients so full of flavor. For dinner we shared the carbonara. Our server Jake suggested sauteed shrimp with the dish and it was just perfect. We finished the meal with the chocolate cake. The food was superb and the personal service from Jake just made the evening perfect. We can't wait to go back!! Thanks Buca!",

I probably could have eaten two of their small lasagnas by myself. As for the small veal marsala, it comes on one normal sized plate with mushrooms and sauce smothered on top. Without any noodles, I can't even imagine how they would expect this dish to serve two people.   The bread is quite fresh and tasty. My lasagna was slightly overcooked. I like my noodles to be slightly firm with some bite to it, like any good pasta. Instead my lasagna noodles were flabby and dissolved in my mouth. However, like I said, it was only slightly overcooked.  2.5 stars. Would rate higher for bigger portions because the price is exorbitant for what you get.",

I would say that the atmosphere here is the draw. They do have a great happy hour and it is conveniently located in our hotel. They need to work on their service, however. Our group of 11 was told to check back in 30 minutes to be seated; which we did. When we returned we were made to feel as though it was a strain to \"fit\" us in. We were ignored, waited another 15 minutes to be seated although the table was ready. When we were, our waiter hardly ever came to check on us. I'm not sure if he felt overwhelmed by our group or what, he looked over at us frequently but never actually came to refill drinks. I had to go find the hostess to send someone over. We always tip %20 and probably would have more if we had been better taken care of.   In short, the food is generic and somewhat over priced. $5 wines are pretty awesome, the atmosphere is nice but the service stinks.",

He Recommended only two large entrees to feed 8 people. We didn't bother to order more (we were all taking about where to go to dinner as we were paying the check) because we had been there an hour and a half already. Buca is usually a decent pick for a big group with kids, but this location is atrocious. They also ruined the quaint little decor that the chain is known for... just sayin...",

When he cleared the table, he reached into the center of the table and began stacking all the used plates right in our faces. No finesse at all. everything as far as service is in slow motion, and you get ignored a lot.  The only thing I must admit they do with great expediency is drop the check on the table.

First off the food took forever. Again, it was their first day so they were really on their trial run. We got spaghetti bolognese and pepperoni pizza. The pizza was fantastic. It was loaded with pepperoni just like I love. It could have been a little more done but that is my fault for not asking. The pasta tasted as it was supposed to but it was luke warm. I could have sent it back but it took so long to get it I didn't want to wait. My wife had a craving for garlic bread so we just ordered it without checking the price. It came as chunks of break with very little butter or garlic flavor. We thought \"oh well\" until we got the check and it was $11 for a basket. That was very disappointing. There is no garlic bread in any restaurant in the United States that is worth $11. It's bread, butter and garlic. I can make it better at home for $3-$4.  All in all they have some improving to do. I wish them good luck.",

The sign outside said lunch from $8.99.  But the lunch menu had nothing less than $11.99!! My wife ordered the cannelloni.  Two !! arrived in a small amount of white sauce.  No garnish, no bread, that's it! My lasagna arrived. A tiny portion, maybe about 3\" by 4\" with a little red sauce.  Again, no garnish, no bread.  It was barely room temperature.  I sent it back for some heat.  It was returned to me hot, but it had been microwaved!!!  How could a restaurant possibly think that is OK?  I refused to pay. I spoke to the manager on the way out.  He couldn't understand why I didn't pay for nuked, mediocre, food!!!  He actually thought it was OK!!! If you want Buca, go to the one on Flamingo East.",

    "text": "Buca di Beppo hosted our reception dinner following our wedding at The ARIA on August 20, 2016. My husband and I chose Buca because Italian is my favorite cuisine, we loved the food when we visited on our last trip and I enjoy the family-style serving of the dishes. (I also love the Excalibur!) The set-up was absolutely great!! We had 35-40 people attend our destination wedding and were given the Wine Room. It is a private area right off the main entrance from the casino, through double glass doors. We had the room reserved for our party for three hours and, months prior to our event, we sent a schedule of how we would like the evening to flow to the event coordinator. The dishes came out right on time, were exactly what we ordered from the catering menu and with more than enough to feed an army! Our adult beverages were never empty, in fact, we had a fresh one waiting for us before we even finished the previous one. Every request was promptly fulfilled by a smiling face. EVERYTHING was absolutely flawless! The servers were so attentive and personable to everyone in our party. Our guests raved about the experience, service, food and employees. I would absolutely, 100% recommend this Buca di Beppo location to anyone hosting an event in Las Vegas! The food is just wonderful and the hospitality is unmatched! Thank you so much Buca for playing a huge part in our wedding day and making our guests, who flew across the country to celebrate with us, full and happy!! I could not be happier with our reception dinner choice and there is not one thing that I could recommend for improvement! Can't wait to come back!!!!! And please, open a location in Oklahoma City soon!! I need my Buca fix! Lol! :D",

    "text": "The reason I give this place 2 stars is because of price and average food. We had a party of 6 and we ordered a large lasagna, a small shrimp florentine, small basket of garlic bread, a beer, and 3 soft drinks. My bill came out to be 100 bucks. The lasagna wasn't great. It lacked meat and it was overly salty. I wasn't impressed at all. And a large isn't so large. You would think that the large would be fairly a large portion when it says it feeds 4 or more people. Trust me, when you have a group of men, it will probably feeds 2-3 people. The lasagna was $40 dollars for a cheese lasagna with no meat. It says meat sauce, but it was just salty cheesy tomato sauce with not a single meat piece. Skip the lasagna, not worth it. The shrimp florentine was good and the garlic bread was delicious. Everything here is al a carte so the bread was $10! And the shrimp florentine was $30 for a small size. What kind of irks me here was that they charge for refills too. So when everyone got refills on their root beer and diet coke they charge $1.75 or something for each refill. So, it was 20 bucks roughly for 3 sodas and a Heineken. Wtf. Let me tell you guys, in Vegas there is not a single establishment that charges for refills on drinks. I feel like this place is a money eater and sends out overly salty food. When the waiter came to ask, would you like a refill on your drink, my party made the assumption that refills were free. I'm surprised they didn't charge me for my tap water and the cups and utensils I used. Jeez. My head was hurting from the massive intake on salt after that. I don't mind dropping a 100 bucks for food, if it was good. A bit disappointed with them. Won't ever be back, way too many great Italian places in Vegas to spend that much on mediocre food.",

If Gordon Ramsey walked into this place and tasted the dishes he would say that it tasted like shit and it looks discussing!  When we complained about the food to the manager he took the eggplant parmigiana off the bill and we only paid for the drinks and salad, which I hardly ate also. My mom had most of the salad and I left hungry because we were going to see a show. The waitress came over and apologize to us and said that it wasn't made fresh! I was looking at her like wtf what did they do microwave the food that was served?! All I could think of was the kitchen nightmares with Gordon Ramsey where the one restaurant kitchen staff prepares all the food then reheats it in the microwave! I rather go to Gordon Ramsey's restaurant in planet Hollywood at least I know that place has standards being that it his restaurant compared to bucca which use to be good!",

The fettuccini was really, really, really thick, but had flavor and the noodles cooked right. The mashed potatoes were awful, $12 for a side that had absolutely no flavor. Bland doesn't begin to describe the lack of the taste of the potatoes.   Also, the noise level was way up there. We could barely hear the waitress and it took nearly yelling to be heard.   Again, the main entree was good but past that no way. We will not be back.",

With the massive \"family style\" portions these guys serve, 3 is just too small of a party, unless you order carefully (and I'm not sure that's actually possible). We ordered a pepperoni pizza, which was a giant lake of grease and just wasn't very good, a salad that would have fed 5-6 people and was marginal at best, and something else that was forgettable. Tab was huge, service was glacial, the entire experience lousy. Definitely won't be back.",

Dave Gordon called me and emailed within the next few days to apologize about my experience.  I had explained to him about the post and that this actually occurred almost a year ago. He said regardless it was still an experience I had and he wanted to make it right and he did! I really appreciate that. I really respect a manager who truly cares about his customers. I would definitely return do to the fact that they care about their customer satisfaction. He asked me to give him a call the next time I go back so he can make sure our next experience is an amazing one. I will definitely take him up on that!",

We stopped in and had to wait about 15 minutes but then were ushered to a table.   The menu had great items to select from but it was a bit uncomfortable when one friend didnt want what everyone else wanted. This is FAMILY STYLE so you get one dish or two to share with everyone.  We had a delicious salad - cant remember the name but it had pancetta and it was delicious.  We had baked rigatoni as well.  It was more than enough for all of us.  With a drink each we paid around 30 a piece. So, it isnt more affordable to eat family style and it could be a pain if you have a group of people with very different taste buds but it turned out ot be an ok experience for us and the food and service were both pretty good.",

I was craving sports, a happy hour and good Italian Food and it was my good Fortune that I was staying at Excalibur.    Buca Di Beppo hit all my categories and then some.  The staff was welcoming from the second I walked in.  I am a solo Convention attendee so sitting in the bar area always saves the table space for the bigger parties.  First let's talk about Happy Hour... $3.00 Bud Lite Drafts that are ice cold are hard to come by.  That thrilled me.  The bread that arrived at the table was warm and crusty that always offers satisfaction over soft rolls.  I had a salad and the shrimp Fra Diavlo ... the salad was crisp with a light but very tasty house dressing.  The Fra Diavlo had a good amount of shrimp and the taste was on target.  I love Italian food and Fra Diavalo was a craving... this cleared the bases for me.  What a hit!  My server (Jacob) was on top of his game with sincerity, honesty and good cheer.  He helped me navigate the menu and kept my glass full with the ice cold $3.00 beers.  I am coming back for another convention in two weeks and I will come back.  This in my opinion was an above board Vegas experience.",

Our servers, Randi and Josh A., were awesome. They brought our food quickly and made sure everyone was taken care of. They had great rapport with all the guests. Just all-around good service. Afterwards they packed up leftovers for the new bride and groom to enjoy. Somehow- they didn't get their saved cannolis . They hadn't had a chance to even try one during the reception. We are staying at Excalibur, so I went down and talked to the manager, Clay. He was so great! Even though he didn't have to do this, he gave me a dozen cannolis at NO CHARGE! He was so kind and thoughtful. He really went above and beyond. I would HIGHLY recommend having any event there. You will NOT be disappointed.",

But the food over all was just ok or in some cases not too good. Bucatini with meat sauce, average/bland. Meat balls average, not enough sauce. Calamari not very good, though. Sausages average. Margherita pizza was bad. Baked ziti was good. Garlic bread bland. Basic bland olive oil for dipping. We had a bottle of wine as well. A $300. dinner bill which is fine but the meal was really below average at best taste wise. And over priced based on portion and quality, taste and any kind of uniqueness. So we were a bit disappointed,  but it was our choice as this was on our list of restaurants we've been wanting to experience. Lastly, the whole small or large plate only (family style) option they offer really didn't work for us and may not for you, consider that before going.",

    "text": "Worst experience ever! The waiter was a complete moron and a liar. I asked him about cheese being in certain dishes due to dietary issues. He told us the spicy chicken rigatoni only had a little parmesean sprinkled on top amd the garlic bread was cheese free. The bread came out slathered in melted cheese. The sauce on the pasta was also super cheesy. I called him out on it, especially after he told the next table about the cheese. He lied and said there were three kinds of garlic bread, but did not explain why he got us a cheesy one when we told him we did not want cheese. I then pointed out what he said to the table next to us. He could not explain lying to us. He acted and looked very unprofessional. Don't trust a man with a giant hole in his ear and knuckle tattoos. The manager came out and comped our meal. Would not go back. Food was not good.",

    "text": "We went to Buca on a Monday night, it's a favorite restaurant for both of us. I have never had worse service anywhere. Our waiter got a bigger table and pretty much ignored us. He never brought us bread, he didn't even bring out our food. When the food did come out, the waiter almost dropped both of them until another waitress helped him and then slammed the plate down on top of my phone and wallet, with no apology, and walked away. We still hadn't gotten the refill and water we asked for at this point. Our original waiter decided to make an appearance and my boyfriend asked him to finally bring us our bread that we should have gotten 45 minutes earlier. We asked for the check and he forgot to apply the $10 discount for the coupon I had given him. Then when he came back to box up our leftovers, he dropped the entire plate on the table, shattering my wine glass and pasta flew all over the place. He was very apologetic, and then brought out our check again. After horrible service and shattering a wine glass and having pasta spill all over, he didn't even comp us the $2 side of Alfredo sauce my boyfriend asked for. Absolutely ridiculous.  UPDATE:  After reading this review, I was contacted by the manager and received THE BEST customer service ever. Craig was extremely apologetic and just an overall sweetheart. He offered to send us something in the mail for our next visit to Buca and we accepted. The next time we're in Vegas, we will be giving this Buca another shot, just because of how awesome Craig was. Thank you Craig for your great customer service!!",

We opted for 1 small appetizer and 3 small main courses for 5 people.  Our waiter said that would be a lot of food, and he only recommends 2 small main courses.  So we trusted him and he was definitely right. Service was bad because, our food took 45 minutes to come out.  The people who had came at the same time as us ordered right away and got their food quite fast.  When they had finished their meal we were still waiting for our food.  Food was good and bad as well.  The food was good because the sauces were delicious.  The pasta seemed undercook and still a bit hard.  Maybe service and food was bad because of the Memorial Day Weekend, so not quite sure.",

The food is very overpriced, the bread they brought out was cold plain white break that looks like they got it from a cheap supermarket, my baked ziti was dry on the top which tells me they either didn't make it fresh or it was sitting out for a long time and my Wife's veal tasted like rubber. Every time someone had a birthday there would be a waiter who would yell extremely loud and start singing, VERY disrupting. A woman choked in front of us and people were doing the Heimlich maneuver on her; not their fault, but just part of the overall negative experience and total waste of $60 for two rotten entrees.",

You can get a \"small\" or \"large\" of basically any dish, and they SAY the small is enough for 2, but you could get 4 light meals from one small dish pretty easily. We had a rehearsal dinner here before my friend's wedding and there were about 14 of us, which they didn't seem to have a problem with at all. The waiter was fun and cheery the whole night, never once complained, and I only had to ask twice for extra lemons for my iced tea and water (the iced tea doesn't come with lemon by default, so make sure to ask if you like it with lemon). We tried some limoncello at the end of the meal and it was the perfect end to a most delicious dinner!",

    "text": "Let me start off by saying I usually love the Buca di Beppo restaurants. I have been many, many times when I lived in San Francisco and I have always loved it. However, I had the worst experience at this location in Las Vegas.    We arrived at the restaurant after 3pm for a late lunch. Although the restaurant was almost completely empty, when we asked for a table, we were told to sit on the bench outside and that we would have to wait a few minutes. We saw the hostess constantly running around looking like she was very busy and talking on the phone. Keep in mind that the restaurant was empty, so I am not sure what she was running around doing. We asked for our table again, but we were once again told to wait. After almost 15 minutes of waiting, we decided to leave. During this time, two other couples were also told to wait, and they also left. To add insult to the injury, she had a horrible attitude - she was quite rude and dismissive, acting like we were doing something horrible by making her get up and do her job. Definitely the worst service I have experienced in a long time (if not the worst service I have EVER experienced).  Honestly, the entire thing is a mystery to me, as I have always loved this restaurant, but I guess they need major re-training of their staff. If I could give it zero stars, I would, but I can't, so I'm giving it - grudgingly - 1 star.",

The service was friendly.  No complaints there.  The free bread was okay.  Nothing special and really not much flavor.  The olive oil also seemed very bland and cheap.  This place is family style.  Each menu item has two choices for portion sizes - one that is to be shared by 2 people and another by like 4 or something.  The salad was definitely enough for 2+ people.  We got the Caeser salad.  It was really good.  For the meal, we settled on the Baked Ziti.  It was probably one of the worst baked zitis that I've had.  Very dry and bland.  Hardly any sauce or cheese.  Devoid of flavor.  Also, the portion was really good for 1 person.  My wife and I both agree on this.  Afterwards, we were both still hungry.  So, for the price, I don't think it was good.  For that price for Baked Ziti, I was expecting a large amount of pasta.  I've been served bigger portion sizes in the $10 range and this was like $20+ or something.  Maybe they were just having a bad night, but I wouldn't be in a rush to go back here again.  That's just me.",

We then ordered the Chicken Limone with the capers on the side as one person in our party is allergic to them and another one is just opposed to the taste.  The Chicken Limone arrived with the capers on top and spread throughout the dish.  I informed Andrea that we ordered it with the capers on the side; she apologized for this and brought the dish back to the kitchen.  The next actions which occurred had me completely shocked as well as puzzled because Buca di Beppo is such a fine establishment with a completely amazing reputation for the high quality of food and service you provide.  Watching the kitchen, the expeditor grabbed a pair of tongs, took a piece of chicken dumped off the capers and put on a new plate which is when I got up to look closer and saw him do this with the rest of the chicken.  A server then went to bring this back to our table; which is when a manager asked me if there was a problem.  I informed him of the actions I had just witnessed and he said first that would not have happened which I told him I saw this action with my own eyes and then he asked the expeditor whom confirmed the actions.  A new dish was brought to our table maybe 15 minutes later if not more - where our children had already finished their food.    Scared to think this is a company norm.",

I ordered Chicken Marsala which came with a salad. The salad was good until I found a piece of paper in it. I told the waitress and she took the salad to a manager. When she returned, she informed me that the paper I found was a gum wrapper. How disgusting!!!! And what was even worse, is that a manager never came to our table to speak with us or offer an apology. The server told us that we would not be charged for the salad. I lost my appetite after that and did not eat my dinner. The waitress apologized and I let her know that she was not to blame. I have worked in the restaurant  buisness for 25 years and I know that when a customer has a complaint, a manager addresses the issue by speaking with the customer. I also know that the wraper ended up in the salad as a result of an employee throwing a piece of gum away. Nobody saw it land in the salad? Most establishments that serve food prohibit employees from chewing gum because of health codes. I understand that sometimes things happen, but it was very unprofessional that none of the managers came to our table. I saw managers walking around the restaurant but none came to our table. It is disgusting that an employee would throw a gum wrapper instead of walking to the garbage can to throw it away. Of all the years, I have eaten at restaurants, I have never complained. I should have listened to my husband's good instincts and stayed away from this place. We will be traveling to Las Vegas again in a few weeks, and I'm staying away from this place.",

The \"small\" portion was huge as it's family style but I made my best effort to finish what I could because it was amazing.  My pesto sauce was fresh, flavorful and just delicious. My son ravaged his rigatoni and my daughter and husband devoured a pizza with the thickest layer of fresh cheese you have ever seen.  I will be craving their food until we get a chance to return again.   Soooo good!   Our server was also so attentive and informative. They took very good care of us. Nothing about our visit deserved anything less than five stars.  Bravo!",

As is the case with many other Vegas franchises, the prices are higher than what you would pay at another location. Despite this, however, the portions are large and tasty. I would recommend the Mixed Antipasto Salad, Linguini Frutti di Mare, and Baked Rigatoni. Additionally, if you have a sweet tooth like me, be sure to get the tiramisu: it's fantastically rich, creamy and absolutely delicious. All in all a good choice if you're looking for filling food at a reasonable price!",

We waited sometime before someone came and took our order, when the waitress came she wasn't too friendly [Name was Jackelyn] we ordered and waited and waited and waited finally we received our food. The pros to this place are that the portions are a very good size you will definitely take some leftovers home and it is very filling. The cons our waitress didn't come and check on us and when we asked of they did anything for your birthday she stated we just sing you have to purchase dessert...um okay, also let them know before if you want your check split or they will just assume one person is picking the tab up. Overall I gave this place 3 stars because the decor is awesome and the food was great.",

The only part of our experience that deserved 5 stars were our servers, who were great, fast, friendly and knowledgable of their menu. Their portions are HUGE and are meant for sharing between 2-4 people. The flavor of the food however, was mediocre.. I'd even say subpar. I was expecting the mozzarella caprese to be made with balsamic vinegar, but instead it was only drizzled with olive oil, so it tasted very plain. Also beware, if adding sun-dried tomatoes to your \"build your own\" entree, because there was an ABUNDANCE of them in our spaghetti.. I kept having to either spit them out of every bite I took, or fish them out on my plate. It was definitely overkill. I'd suggest ordering them on the side.",

I love Italian food... so we had some family visiting from home and we were craving for some great Italian food plus we had something at the Excalibur anyway... we got there and it was a lot of people waiting to get in but they had no reservations not sure how long the wait was but we had made our reservations though open table... thankfully we got seated on time... of course it was packed for a weekend night but our server was awesome! Michelle she was so nice and very friendly with excellent customer service... All her suggestions was right on the money! And she got our food out quick... She was very upbeat and totally entertaining we just had such a great time... Huge Mahaloz for a great evening and a wonderful visit... by far this is our favorite location... we will be back...",

The tomato sauce has so much acidity that I think they put it directly on the plate from the can.  Or they cook it for a very short time.  Service?   Questionable",

    "text": "Terrible. As an Italian American I'm embarrassed for how bad the food and service was at this place.   Everything started off OK - I got seated and a waitress came by in about 5 minutes to get my drink order. After that, I put in my food, ordered a pizza well done.   After waiting almost 30 minutes (which is fine, I ordered a well done pizza after all), I received a pizza that immediately collapsed after picking it up. It wasn't even hot! It was lukewarm!!! The bottom of the pizza was totally raw and the only way to eat it was to eat the bombing of toppings on my plate with a fork because they slid off of the \"crust.\"   The toppings themselves were a chronically under-seasoned meat sauce and raw veggies. I had to add salt at the table it was so bland.   Plus, I never saw my waitress again. The guy who dropped off my pizza (the manager?) grabbed me a beer when I finally got some service, then adiosed also. Some entirely different person then ran my check when I finally flagged someone after waiting another 30 minutes.   Worse dining experience in Las Vegas period. Horrible food - I'd sooner to to Olive Garden, that's how bad it was.  Lots of amazing places to eat in Vegas - I'd give this one a miss.",

    "text": "Buca di Beppo Italian Restaurant is a mouthful lol.. Literally of Italian food ha-ha! I know I'm cheesy but so what. Before I say anything let me first say that you need to come to this place HUNGRY. I'm talking like umm.. don't eat for the whole day and come for dinner only.   Buca has a few locations in town and this one which is located inside of the Excalibur Hotel & Casino happened to be the one I recently visited. On the weekends they can get extremely packed so I do recommend you making a reservation. My family of 6 was hungry so I knew better than to just show up and expected a reasonable wait time. Opentable works wonders for booking your own reservations that's for sure!   When we arrived it was packed just as I expected. With an expedited entry we were seated pretty much right away. Took some time for the server to come which was a like ugh but he was an okay guy. Very blah and really didn't seem to enthusiastic about answering any of the questions we had on the menu. My step mom has food allergies and needed some different options so he seemed annoyed.   All the portions that they offer can feed multiple people so don't even think about ordering an entree just for yourself unless you are interested in pigging out. Left overs are a MUST here. You can dine here and look around at how much food is still left on the table from people not finishing which is why in the beginning I said to come hungry.   As far as the food goes.. Let just say that it was better than the service. Sometimes that can actually be the case! Based off the reviews from my fellow YELP folks I knew which dishes were a no go. Pays to actually sit down and go through the pictures and save yourself the disappointment. Family loved the meal! Will I be back? Probably not...",

We waited 10 minutes for our waiter to take our drink order. He finally came around and was sweating profusely as if he had just finished a workout. Not the best combination when he's handing drinks & food. To top it off, we felt rushed to order. Also, the lady that takes the pictures walked right past us and did not ask if we wanted to take a picture.  Not that we wanted the photo but it's rude to take pictures of some customers, but not others. We will never come back to this Bucca!",

    "text": "Our server Chris was the best. Myself and my kids visited Buca in the middle of the week for an early dinner. I forgot that the portions were large, but all 3 of us wanted different meals. Chris was so helpful in helping us ordering our dinner. My son ending up having the kids Mac and cheese with a large meatball on the side. He's still talking about it. I tried it myself and it was darn good. My daughter wanted pasta with creamy pesto. They substituted the Alfredo sauce for creamy pesto. Chris made it happen and I got a small pepperoni pizza. It was all very good.  Chris is the type of server you want to have at any restaurant. Nothing I asked him was a problem. He was informative, invested in the quality of Buca de Beppo and this made myself and my kids very happy. He visited the table often. Our drinks came in good time, the bread came in due time and so did the dinner. The timing was perfect. I wish more restaurants were just as good.  We're coming back in May and will visit Buca again. Chris, thank you for your service and we'll ask for you next time.",

    "text": "For the price and portion.. I was expecting better. Yes, it's family style.. They went on and on about it, the portion was decent, but I wouldn't say it was that big. I've seen a fair amount of places with portions that big for less than that price. Granted I'm from Wisconsin and I went there on an empty stomach, I was going all out. So yeah, Buca calls it family style, I call it one hungry Wisconsinite portion with 1/3 to take home.  Anyway, noodles are quite inexpensive so the dish better taste pretty damn good to be worth the price, and to me.. It was lacking. That extra money is basically going to the atmosphere and experience. ( which my friend said that the Buca on Flamingo is much cozier) My friend and I ordered 2 appetizers ( with a coupon through Buca's website) We had the antipasto salad, and  mozzarella garlic bread. I enjoyed the salad, and the bread was decent, but it took at least 20-25 minutes for it to come out. The waiter wasn't the greatest either, and he looked busy, but I really felt like we were put on the back burner compared to his other tables. People that were seated after us were receiving their appetizers before we did, one family even had their pizza come out while we STIll waited for our appetizers!  I ordered the ravioli al pomodoro, and trust me, it wasn't worth 25 dollars. To me it tasted quite basic, and the sauce tasted like it came out of a Ragu jar. I have to say that my friend enjoyed the sauce, but it looked watered down and tasted pretty basic. My friend ordered the penne arrabbiata, that was okay, I liked it more than what I ordered, but still nothing to write home about. When the bill came out, the waiter had forgotten that we had mentioned earlier that we had a coupon, we had showed it to him earlier but he needed to see it again for the code, but because it was through my friends phone, it only allowed him to open it once and it couldn't be used again. Our waiter said, \"sorry\" but there was nothing he could do. I think he really didn't care, and was sick of dealing with us, he wanted us out of there ASAP. He had mentioned earlier that today was his last night before his vacation so... Hmm. I understand that the coupon issue wasn't the waiters fault, but I've worked at restaurants before where you try your best to please the customer, he made no attempt to offer up the manager or try to help. It wasn't like we were lying since we showed the coupon to him earlier. I know it's a chain, and I really noticed it in the food, perhaps I'm picky, but I prefer a smaller, non-chain, authentic Italian restaurant, where you might get a slightly smaller portion size, but the food is cooked with thought and doesn't taste like it came out of a bag, jar, or can. Needless to say.. Not going back there again.",

The hostesses, who were holding menus and ready to seat us, said yes. We ended up seating ourselves like normal customers who decide to sit in the bar area, but we were completely ignored for a good seven to ten minutes or so... without menus! Finally, our server came up to us and asked if we needed menus. Duh. I have never been to a Buca di Beppo in my whole, entire life, so yes. I would very much like a menu. Well, the server ended up being pretty nice, though. He took our order in a timely manner, and he refilled our drinks when needed. I ordered the baked ziti, and my boyfriend ordered the chicken carbonara. The chicken on his dish wasn't all that good, as it tasted like frozen chicken or pre-cooked chicken. Other than that, the food was good. Our bill came out to $27 after the $10 off (without tip), which isn't bad, because we didn't finish our meals and had leftovers to take back to the room for dinner! I would rate the experience as three and a half stars... but I'll round up.",

I don't know how long it has been open for the service was really spotty.  The tables are too small for the family style service and we constantly had to ask for plates to eat on.  We started with a caesar salad that was really plain and had a very sweet pungent dressing.  The salad was delivered and placed on the wrong table before we received it.  We ordered the Chicken Limone, and the Veal Parmesan with two sides of pasta.   The chicken was tender, but flavorless and had virtually no sauce and two small capers.  The Veal was so sweet it tasted like sugar was literally sprinkled directly on the meat.  The sides of pasta were overcooked and the sauce was also sickeningly sweet and looked like it came out of a can.   Overpriced, amateur staff, and really bad food.",

    "text": "Great looking place with big prices, big portions and mediocre food. The meat dishes (that are in the range of $21 - $40 a plate) don't come with a side. If you want a side, then that's an extra $7-$9. Even something such as the Italian broccoli is $9. Here's a tip for anyone who goes here, the small portions are huge and the large portions are even huger. Order the small portions and share your food with others. Order a meat dish and then order a pasta dish, ask for extra plates and just create your own meat with a side of pasta dish.  For appetizers, we ordered the calamari ($13). They were so tiny. Tiny little itty bitty rings and teeny tiny little clusters of tentacles. I've had bigger and better calamari, and for far less. Then for our entrees, we ordered the Linguini Frutti Di Mare (a seafood linguini in wine sauce) and the Prosciutto Stuffed Chicken. My husband and I shared them amongst each other. The seafood on the Linguini was good and abundant, however the pasta was terrible. For $23 a plate, I expected the Linguini to be fresh (there is a huge and obvious difference) It wasn't, it was obviously a dried pasta that was overcooked, whereas it had a slimy consistency. I've had fresh pastas at Italian restaurants in Chicago, Philly, and New York that weren't even close to these outrageous prices. One that comes to mind is La Luce in Chicago (one of my favorites). They serve fresh homemade pasta, and the prices range from $14-$17 for huge portions.   As for the chicken, it was ok. The chicken was cooked perfectly and was wonderfully juicy. However, the breading on top was a little burnt, creating a bitter flavor. That was really disappointing. Again, for $23 I expected more.   The service was great though. That is until we paid for our dinner. After that our waiter could have cared less. He shoved a large portion of linguini into a tiny plastic container, then wrapped it in a plastic bag with my husbands leftovers. When I went to grab the bag, the bag broke, fell on the ground and my linguini spilled everywhere within the bag. Our waiter just walked by a few times without saying a word. He didn't even offer to help get us a second container and bag. We finally stopped him to ask for them. He fetched one for us, and still completely dismissed what had happened. The sad part is, it was only us and another small party, so being too busy to help wasn't really an issue. He just flat out didn't care. It was so obvious and really awkward.   All in all, the experience was not that great. My wallet is very sad and so is my palate. Bucca should either serve better food or lower their prices.",

We had a party of 26 and changed it a couple times; they were more than accommodating.  Most brought cash but staff did accommodate cards for alcohol and those that forgot cash.

Almost immediately. Then after the entree came.. came the fat tub of lard crashing to the floor of exhaustion. Took about half an hour to get the check. Trying to get that 5 dollar parking since the strip charges now wtf. They tryna hustle us to pay 10 bucks parking by making us dine in longer. Jk. But the waitress, while we seen her was really nice, like the nice fit kid who didn't make fun of you and talked to you ever so often as he overlapped you 5 times. The food was really good though!

I just want to say the service my family received by him is absolutely excellent. He quickly realized how stressed my husband I were trying to calm down our three year old twins. He immediately rushed over took our order, sent out bread and even suggested some plates to share. We couldn't believe how fast our came out and the twins within minutes were eating and enjoying their delicious food. My husband and I work in banking and we know how important customer service is. Joe definitely deserves the recognition, praise and with no doubt be promoted to corporate. We thanked him and tried to tip him but he did not want to accept it and instead to tip the staff because they also work hard. Wow wow wow! Very rare to find a manager that appreciates his team and customers.",

My boyfriend and I decided to try and eat there for lunch since we are staying at the Excalibur. That was a MISTAKE. The waitress kept touching my boyfriend and I let it go because I didn't want to make a scene. It progressively got worse and he made a comment about how uncomfortable he was and how badly he just wanted to leave. Our food came and that's when it got worse. I for the fettuccini alfredo and it was sitting so long it started to get a thick film over the top of it. So gross. Look, it could have been a man, woman, alien, I don't care. It's about respect. Wether in a relationship or not. You shouldn't be touching customers. I wish I could have enjoyed the meal. But even if the experience and service was better. The food was not up to par. UPDATE currently have the worst stomach ache",

We called the restaurant and they merely said \"we'll look into it\" and never called us back as they promised. The school nurses got involved, which brought the health district involved. They realized we have contracted norovirus. How can they take this so lightly?! I'm surprised they haven't called back many of the students who called them to report the food poisoning, begging them to take a free gift card or something.

Our server told us we could order from the lunch menu or family style menu, which would probably save us a couple bucks if two or more of us wanted the same thing. You can definitely share even the lunch portions. We had the chicken parmigiana with spaghetti, the baked ziti and the spicy chicken rigatoni. All three were HUGE portions and I ate maybe 1/3 of mine. Our server was just kind of rude and insisted she couldn't split the appetizer between our checks (I waited tables for about five years and I find it hard to believe your computer system doesn't have that capability), but food was decent and not bad for the price compared to other Vegas restaurants.",

When each family tried to use their coupons the manager said they could not do it because if was the companies policy. The food was alright and service was ok. Ask about the coupons before you eat and the beer was two expensive. Won't eat here again.",

    "text": "Another late night Vegas dinner, we made reservations for 9:30pm, showed up on time and still had to wait for a table.  Big pet peeve of mine.  Our server was fairly snappy about their portion sizes when we both ordered separate entrees.  She over-emphasized it was for sharing.  Yes... we know.. you said it multiple times.   Our plan was to eat some of our entree and have it as lunch and leftovers during our road trip.  The portions were ginormous, and we were warned, we planned for 2 day lunch leftovers but it was good for 3 days.  I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs, it was delicious.  Giant meatballs made properly Italian (half pork/half beef).   Despite the small annoyances, I enjoyed the food.",

After all the hype it was a mediocre experience that ended up with all of us getting food poisoning - I'm fairly sure it was this place as we'd all eaten different things for 24 hours leading up to eating and sharing meals here.  I will say our waiter was fantastic, I wish I'd got his name, and we were seated very quickly. But the food was average. I've made better lasagna and I'm no Jamie Oliver! Then the next morning we all had upset stomachs...I couldn't believe it would be such a reputable place but like I say, we hadn't all eaten the same thing for a whole day before. It's a shame.",

The meal was a small penne portion and more than enough for two. It was very yummy. At the end of our meal, the server forgot to run the Groupon and my card was already charged for the amount. The manager, Jay, came to our table to handle the situation in a very professional and respectful way. We are beyond impressed with how they handled the situation. We will be back to this location because of the incredible customer service.",

The process was seamless from when I contacted them although through to the end our meal.  They were extremely accommodating and took care of all of our needs.    We went with the Bravissimo package and every item we choose was spectacular.  We had way to much food, but we didn't  want to miss out on any of the items we picked.  Some of our favorites were the calamari, apple gorgonzola salad, cheese manicotti, chicken parmigiana, broccoli romano, cheesecake, and cannoli...and that's only part of what we ordered!!  Plus, it was reasonable with the open bar package we selected, we can still afford a honeymoon:)  A special thank you to Denise (event coordinator) and our servers Kurt and Sherae.  Thank you for making our day SO special!",

Staffing was short but (I hope I spelled his nam e right) our server kept up the pace and I think he even stayed after the rush to keep everyone happy.

We were sat at a table and when we asked for the happy hour they talked about. We were told we had to go to the bar are to get the special so we were moved.  Ordered one of the lunch special and it came out quickly. The meat and sauce were good however the noodles were very hard. I did not when finish my food.  The cheese sticks were good and also hot. Best part of the meal.  The server although nice was slow. He would leave to get something for us and would return 5 mintues later.  I do not ever see myself returning.",

Wasn't much   garlic at all. My salad wasn't good and dressing was bland. My friend went to sit down in the booth and it fell forward almost hurting him. The manger came out and fixed it but nothing else. Never offered to move us or offer anything. We do not recommend this restaurant.",

    "text": "Visited the restaurant for the first time this past Saturday for a friends birthday, and the food was good!   I knew it was family size servings, and the menu states that the Large portion feeds up to 5 people, but honestly it can feed a family of 7! We had a party of 12 and ordered: two pastas, a pizza, and a salad, and had tons of left overs! The portions are huge, and like I mentioned the large size can def feed more than 5 people.   The table reserved was nice, and apart from the noise. So it was nice being able to hear everyone, and enjoy conversations without having to yell. Their birthday celebrations are cute, and different in a way. They sing, and bring out a big candle, along with a dessert for the birthday girl/boy. It was nice.  Only downfall was that when we were seated servers would walk past our table, watch us sit there, and not offer any drinks or service. After 10 minutes of waiting one of the girls in the party got up, and asked the host who our server was, and how we've been waiting for someone to take our drink order. Finally, he shows up, and provides us great service throughout the evening!   Overall, it was a good experience minus the minor hiccup. I would def go back.",

The white sangria is also good and was garnished with fresh fruit. Great experience and staff will be back again for some excellent italian food!!",

As soon as I emailed corporate about my experience in detail, I was contacted immediately by the divisional Vice President who apologized sincerely and directly dealt with management and staff at the location. A more favorable outcome was offered and in return I wanted to update my review. The situation was now handled correctly by management which I sincerely appreciate since I have many years in the service industry as well. It's basic customer service.  10/30/2017: Visited tonight for my girlfriends birthday dinner and brought friends and her mom that I flew in from L.A just for dinner. Thought this location had the best reviews of all the locations in the valley.  Absolutely terrible management. Our group was originally large so we confirmed the Popes Room. Upon arrival the group number shrunk but we were still told we would have the room. The host told us otherwise and she checked with the manager. She never told us we did not have the room but we were led to a regular table. Bad communication and bad management!   Our waiter took a good 5-10 minutes to first visit the table and tell us he would be with us shortly. Another 10 goes by and he stopped to take drink orders which took another 10 just for waters and soda. Another 5 for the sangria. He rarely stopped by except to finally drop off food.  He dropped off the check and told us he would get boxes for the leftovers and never returned. I pulled the manager over and told him all of the disappointments. He gave us a \"discount\" maybe taking a little tax off.  DO NOT VISIT THIS LOCATION. WE ALL COMMENTED HOW SHITTY THE MANAGEMENT AND SERVICE WAS AND TIPPED AS SUCH.  Disappointing experience and even more disappointing birthday dinner.",

The five cheese white pizza is an all-time favorite, and during happy hour the Italian margarita is a bonus. They make it with amaretto which is a nice bonus. The food took quite a while to arrive to us and we were starving, but I guess you can't complain when you are using a coupon and taking advantage of all the happy hour drink specials.

I have updated the rating from 1 to 3 stars in reflection of this, as it seems that management does not want this to occur again.  ORIGINAL DETAILS:  Booked through OpenTable to get the points. Arrived at the restaurant and explicitly asked the host to check in my reservation so I could get the points, despite his eagerness to seat me right away because the place was not busy at all. He played with the screen for a bit and acted like he checked me in, apparently lying right to my face: I got an e-mail from OpenTable two hours later indicating that I never showed for my reservation. Not only does this mean I did not earn any points for dining at Buca di Beppo, but it also puts a red mark on my OpenTable account for allegedly not making it to a reservation.  I've raised the matter with OpenTable, but know that right out of the gate that the employees at this location would are more interested in being dishonest about something that probably costs them a 50 cent commission than actually serving up a halfway-decent dining experience. No wonder they're broke and give out coupons like they're going out of style.",

    "text": "Well, I had come here years ago with friends and enjoyed it so I was looking forward to trying it again. I'm here on business and attempted to come solo. Operative word being \"attempted\".   When I walked in, I was given a lunch menu (it was 6pm) with no explanation as I waited for a table to be cleaned for me. When I inquired if this was a mistake, I was told no and that I'd have to order off of the lunch menu because the dinner menu was \"family style\" (for 3 or 5 people).  I commented that what I wanted wasn't on the lunch menu (I love stuffed shells). I was told that they may be able to accommodate me anyway. Great! I asked the waiter and he double checked with management and he was told no because things are \"pre-made\" for 3 or 5. I can't understand how it would have been so difficult to take a single portion of stuffed shells from a \"3 person meal\"- the left overs could have been added to another 3 person meal to make a 5 person meal, so nothing would have been wasted. Then menu even outlined \"price per person\", so determining what to charge would not have even been difficult.   But fine, I'll order off the lunch menu as I was originally told I'd might have to. I try to order a chicken BLT sandwich. Sounds easy, right? No crazy ingredients, would have taken less than 10 minutes. I was then told that because it wasn't lunchtime, they could not do that for me because they didn't have the ingredients prepped. For a chicken BLT sandwich?!  What do you need to prep? And I know it's not lunch time but you won't accommodate me for the dinner menu because I'm dining alone and you told me I'd have to order from the lunch menu!    I was offered other foods that I didn't want and walked out. By that point I was disgusted that they didn't even seem to care to accommodate me. And nothing against the waiter, he seemed to try.   I'm sorry my money isn't as good as those there with families, but it's a damn shame that you couldn't figure out a very simple solution. I wasn't asking for a 12 course meal.  I wasn't even asking for a special-made order. I was asking for something you already have made and likely will be throwing some away of tonight.   I recommend you rethink how you treat your solo patrons, though you probably won't since you make enough money off of the larger groups/families and don't need us.",

    "text": "We had eaten at the Seattle BdB some years ago and enjoyed it so when we saw the big sign at the entrance of the Excalibur Hotel on the strip, we didn't hesitate in giving this one a try.  It did not disappoint us in the least. We happened to be a party of 3 so the \"small\" orders which feed 3 people worked out well for us. Portions of everything we saw coming out of the kitchen were inordinately large and really \" a small\" feeds four easily.  We had leftovers to bring back to the hotel we were staying at. The only drawback is if your party is less than 3 you still have to order all that food.  Many couples were not finishing even half of their orders which all got thrown away which made me feel bad knowing people are going hungry, probably just down the street. The food is good!  We ordered the small Shrimp Scampi Linguini and the small Broccoli Romana which is served family style. Leftovers were a full meal for 1 person.   The cannoli (again you have to order 3 at  a time), were the best since I left NYC...the genuine article! So definitely eat here...just be sure to bring family and friends and be prepared to take home food if you can.  Service was very good with a large wait staff and plenty of bussers hustling to get people seated and bringing out orders piping hot.  Prices for Vegas are reasonable and you pay per person with a 3 minimum.  We three ate the pasta, veggies and dessert for $66 (incl tax)plus tip.  Reservations are advisable, especially on week-ends.  I would give it five stars but the food waste and the minimums still bother me.",

    "text": "At the southwest corner of Las Vegas Boulevard and Tropicana Avenue stands a colossal castle called the Excalibur. Inside the castle there is an Italian restaurant that serves portions of food fit for a king.      It was Christmas Day when I toured the Christmas decorated hotels and public areas of the Strip from Mandalay Bay to Fashion Show. As I was walking through the Excalibur, I spotted Buca di Beppo Italian Restaurant. The red colors caught my eye. I decided to look at the menu. The hostess let fall that if you are dining alone that you can have the lunch special all day long. A few hours later, I would return to the Castle to enjoy food portions that would make me feel like a king.      This Buca di Beppo is one of several in a chain of Italian restaurants that are owned by Planet Hollywood. Currently there are around 95 of them. Buca di Beppo has risen to fame with their outrageous portions of delicious Italian food that are called a la carte or family style. These portions are meant to be shared. But what if you love Italian food and are on a solo dining adventure? Buca di Beppo serves individual size entrees that are the lunch special. In the case of the solo diner, the lunch special could be ordered at 5 pm or 9 pm.      Obviously a restaurant serving king sized portions of tasty Italian food is sure to attract a lot of diners. The upshot is there was a short wait. Time went fast while waiting on a bench overlooking the menazene level of the castle. Ironically Buca di Beppo means Joe's basement in Italian. A few minutes later, they called my name.       Buca di Beppo does a nice job with the decor. Despite the fact that this is a chain, , it felt like I was dining in a family-owned Italian restaurant.      I walked in here decided on ordering eggplant parmigiano with spaghetti (lunch price $12.99) and a Pepsi ($3.29). As expected the portion was humongous. Who needs a buffet with portions this big. The left side of the plate held eggplant parmigiano topped with marinara sauce, Roma tomatoes, fresh basil, and mozzarella cheese. The right side held spaghetti with marinara sauce. I exchanged over $17 with Buca di Beppo for a meal that was both quantity and quality. After finishing all this food, I walked out of the castle feeling like the king.",

She was in the kitchen most of the meal to the point where another waitress saw our meals in the window and said she wait 5 minutes to see if outlets server would get it and never did so she delivered our food. As for refills on our drinks that never happened. We had a coupon from online and used it as well as ordered the Monday madness meat balls that was 50% off on Mondays. After we got food the check came and I was confused. I said the meatballs were 50% off why dose that not reflect. I was told oh yeah u can't use a coupon and get the deals of the day. Mind you it's not posted anywhere. So we paid the bill that took 10 minutes for her to bring my card back. After there we left it was sad because as I stated the food was good but the staff was a joke. I recommend you go else where for the service.",

    "text": "Not my favorite Italian restaurant.  It's a very loud place and I felt was too busy for me to even pay attention to one thing. There was too much going on that day. There was wedding parties, big families, birthdays, and so on.  I was on a date and felt that it was way too loud and crazy for a nice \"getting to know each other\" type of date. So, I'd avoid this place if that's what you're going for.   The ambiance was everywhere. Reminded me of an Italian version of TGIF. Yanno, random things on the wall and every waiter and waitress running around everywhere. Also, singing the happy birthday song to every table.  As for the food.... the waitress suggested we should order carefully as the food are all family style large portions. There's 2 girls on a date with one another, we weren't going to eat that much. I'm not a fan that they were all large portions though. I wanted to try other things on the menu, but I wasn't going to order it if they're all family portions. SO, we ordered the lasagna and some garlic bread.   It was a HUGE portion! There was a lot of garlic bread too! The food tasted a little bland for my liking. I felt the sauce wasn't giving me anything. I had to put a lot of parmesan on it to taste anything. The garlic bread wasn't too bad though. I liked it. At the end, we both didn't even finish our food. We took it to go. All in all, the experience was only well worth it because the waitress was very kind and always checked on us. Food wise, eh. So-so.",

The small is enough for about 2 people and the large is good enough for maybe 3-4 people. I tried the penne basilica, lasagna, caesar salad, and garlic bread. I would recommend getting everything, but the penne basilica because they gave way more pasta than chicken or broccoli (there was only 2-3 pieces). The garlic bread is worth getting because they put a generous amount of garlic on their bread and you get a whole basket! The downside is that it does not come with your meal and you have to pay $9.99. The atmosphere is pretty lively and they play lots of oldy kinda music. This place is really affordable and is really filling!",

We got the lasagna, the spaghetti with meatballs and the spicy chicken rigatoni. All were so good! I especially liked the rigatoni. It had a nice kick and even though I don't like peas the sauce was so good I didn't even taste them.  I finished about half the bowl and took the rest home and it was still really good the next day. Can't wait to come here again.",

For those of you unfamiliar with paleo, it's no wheat/gluten, no dairy, no added sugars, all natural, etc.... You can imagine the anxiety I had going to a full on Italian restaurant! We had a party of 20 and the dishes were already ordered ahead of time. I told our waiter my situation. I believe his name was Ian... I let him know that I could eat meat, fruit, vegetables but not to stress over it, I could pick and choose. He literally brought me my own salad (no cheese, dressing, or croutons), then made me my own plate of grilled chicken (which he told Me they specially made for me without flour), grilled vegetables, and when they brought out desserts (which I admit I still had a couple of bites of regardless) he brought me a beautiful bowl of fresh fruit. This accommodating, flexible, friendly caring but staff deserves way more than 5 stars. I am so appreciative of their service!!",

They want you to stay as long as you want! Family Style all around.  The Good.- all the pasta is made in-house! The pasta is delicious, the sauces are full flavor and The portions are huge! With a large serving at least 6 people can eat and be fully satisfied!   The Great.- if you are having a birthday, this is the spot to celebrate it! They bring you a huge candle, everyone comes and sings to you. They make you feel special! Like your family would!   The Best.- kudos to the staff, everyone is very friendly and They keep checking on you. They even give you a free picture, and of course they try to sell you an additional one, but it's a great deal! And guess what! Its a business, that's what business do.  Overall.- portions are huge, staff is very friendly, food is good. Come hungry, make sure that you do not order too much food and you will leave happy!",

After a very long drive from San Diego, our big family decided to stop by Buca for a family style dinner. Their dishes are definitely meant to be shared so it is best to come here when you have a bunch of people tagging along with you. For their antipasti, the mozzarella garlic bread and fried calamari is a must! Make sure you ask for extra marinara sauce because you would want to dip your calamari in that tomato goodness. For the insalate, you will never go wrong with the Caesar salad. That bowl of greens is very refreshing! For pizza, order the spicy arrabbiata although I think it is a bit weak for my liking. If you name something \"spicy-whatever\" make sure that it is spicy enough. The large linguine fruitti di mare made up for the not-so-stellar spicy arrabiatta. Always a favorite, their fruitti di mare is a must for seafood lovers.  I would have given this restaurant a 4 but gave them a 3 instead because of the spicy arrabbiata. And even though the fruitti di mare was very good, at least 6 of the mussels were closed. I think that was poor preparation. Such a shame...",

LOL - You cannot go wrong with Buca, but make sure you've got a full wallet because you definitely get what you pay for!!",

    "text": "I have dreams about their chicken carbonara. It's the dish I could eat everyday of my life. They'd have to knock out my walls and carry me on a flatbed truck to get me anywhere, but its fantastic. They don't use bacon, which really makes the difference.  Their chicken limon is fantastic, so is the caprese salad. Fantastic mozzarella.   Their bread is always a little hard and stale. Plus, it's family size amounts unless you get a lunch special.   Most importantly, sign up for their mailing list and like them on Facebook. You get great coupons.",
