We were also greeted with both of the brothers who own the restaurant and you could truly tell that restaurant was their baby and they took such great pride in it. We had the 3 tacos combo plate the corn and the not nachos all for around 25 bucks which is crazy affordable compared to other Mexican restaurants I have been to. Everything we are was amazing with so much flavor! This is why I have rated them 5 stars service friendly and family oriented, atmosphere colorful and creative and food savory and tasty. Worth trying for sure!!",

We shared chips and chorizo queso dip and that was so tasty. Staff was constantly asking how everything was tasting and if we needed anything else.

We were pleasantly amazed with every bite. We are grown and raised by Mexican families and I will say the one major difference is the portions. They are quite a bit smaller then the tragical Mexican plate which is perfect tho!!!! You can try more things and don't feel bad cause you can't finish it all. Yum yum yum. What a surprise.

    "text": "I don't think you can fully appreciate the funky vibe of this place unless you pay a visit, either for happy hour 4-7 p.m. ( and all night Sunday and Monday) or, as we did, for dinner.  It was like being in a Mexican shrine for Day of the Dead, including skeleton-themed fabric headrests on the booths.  So cool!  As a Mexicophile, I truly appreciated the ambience, as well as the latin music - heavy on the Mexican, but with some Shakira and cumbia thrown in.  I couldn't stop dancing, even before the Riesling I had to go with my meal.    Our waiter didn't seem to know much about the menu, but he was helped along by Vernesa, who did.  I ordered the taco platter, choosing the chicken mole, marinated pork, and the fish.  Two of the three were winners:  the chicken mole taco was outstanding and the pork was very good.  The fish wasn't.  I could have ordered it grilled, but took Vernesa's suggestion and went with the default - fried.  There was almost no fish in that taco, and the pitiful amount turned out to be breading rather than fish.  The Veracruz coleslaw that was the taco-mate of the fish was tasteless.  I didn't complain about it until I was asked, and I'm very disappointed that not only wasn't it comped, I was still charged the \"seafood surcharge.\" Only 50 cents, but I think that if a customer says there was no fish in the fish taco, management shouldn't add insult to injury by charging more.  My husband ordered the chicken enchiladas.  It was a picture-perfect, beautiful plate of food, and he enjoyed it.  Our friend had a pork burrito and liked that, too.  We all loved the plate of chips, guac, and fresh pico de gallo we were served at the beginning.  Those chips might be the best I've ever had!  I found the alcohol surprisingly pricey, not across the board, but for some of the offerings.  The bar seems to be a work in progress and opened after the restaurant did.  The bartender brought me a taste of the one Riesling they had, a label I'd never heard of - 14 Hands.  Terrific, and not overpriced.  All of the staff were so friendly that it was a pleasure.  Had it not been for my fish taco experience and, at the end, me being greatly insulted by our waiter in his inept attempt to be friendly (and I'm still upset), this would have been a 5-star review.",

    "text": "I have been to Pinches a few times.  I have to admit that I am a huge fan.    THE GOOD:  Carne Asada is off the hook!!  I love that you get good quality beef here.  Cut into chunks so you can taste the meat.  This isn't the poor quality cheap stuff you get at other places.  This is the Real Deal Holyfield.    I've made my own creation here.  I order the potato & cheese flautas and get 2 orders of carnitas without the tortilla.  i smother the flautas with the carnitas then dig in.  It is so so so so good.  I'm trying to convince Javier to make this a menu item and call it the Uncle Willy.  hahaha.  If you like Enchiladas, you'll love Pinche's Enchiladas.  Their red sauce is amazeballs!!!  After trying the cheese as well as the shrimp, i prefer the cheese.  It is just a better marriage.  I can't explain what makes the sauce so good, but it is definitely the best Enchilada sauce I've ever had.    Gringo Tacos are... in a word... fan-funky-tastic.  Shredded beef and mozerella in a fried taco shell should not work, but it does.  I'm not sure why it tastes so good, because my brain is telling me this shouldn't work, but it does.  This taco is so good.  Happy Hour at Pinche's is kind of like going to a party at your buddies place.  You know the place well, you go with some friends, but you don't necessarily know everyone there when you walk in.  But by the time you leave, you're friends with everyone.  Exactly how I feel about Pinche's at Happy Hour.  Always making new friends and having a great time.    The outdoor patio is great for this time of year.  Perfect place to sit and puff a cigar along with your favorite drink.  There is a descent amount of foot traffic, so you can also people watch.    If you're a fan of Mexican street corn, aka elote, you'll love the offering here at Pinche's.  They do it a little differently than other places.  You get the cotija and chili powder, but you also get some crema  THE BAD:  Only thing negative I can say is the burritos can do with less beans and more meat.  I find that the meat to beans ratio is a bit off here.  But if you like refried beans, you'll love the refried beans at Pinche's.",

    "text": "Introduction:  What a catchy name, Pinches, LOL. A friend informed me about the Tacos here. Apparently, it's the best tacos you'll ever have. Guess what? Never knew my friend was a carpenter, cause he NAILED IT!   Quality: 5/5 We had the BEST, YES, the BEST Carnitas, Chicken, Asada and Gringo Tacos in this Universe. It was prepared with fresh hand made Tortillas.  I've never had Tacos with fresh Tortillas before. It was definitely a \"WOW\" factor and I don't get wowed easily by Tacos.    I also had the corn on the cob, just with butter, none of that other stuff it comes with and that was just as AMAZING.  Customer Service: 5/5 Extraordinary! Superb! Exceptional! Yes, that good. The girls were welcoming, made proper recommendations and accommodating from start to finish.  Price: 5/5 Definitely FIVE STARS if you go before 7:00 p.m. for their happy hours. Now for their regular prices, some may find it a little pricy.  Not to me, because of the quality.    For example, a Taco can cost you as much as $3.00+.  So if you're use to that $1.25 Tacos, ain't happening here.  But like I said, I don't mind it cause it's top quality.  Cleanliness: 5/5 Immaculate! The whole complex looked fairly new anyway.  Tips: There's another Pinches in Downtown Las Vegas that is just as good.  Also, caution, the spicy Salsa are pretty HOT, eat at your own risk.  Ok, on my way for a dessert to finish this great beautiful night.",

    "text": "Disappointed. There's no other word for it. Came here because I saw all the great reviews on Yelp and the 4.5 star rating and figured it had to be something awesome. Well, it fell short, very short of awesome.   I will say that the staff is very friendly. When we walked in we were immediately greeted by a waiter and he was very informative and nice. Plus the decor is very cool. I was already excited about the food thinking with such friendly staff and cool decor that it couldn't be anything but great.   The taco al pastor was nothing special. The meat was dry and the corn tortilla was soggy. Next up was my side of Mexican rice and tortilla soup. The rice was okay again nothing special and the tortilla soup was probably the worst I've ever had. I know good real Mexican food and this wasn't it. The soup had a consistency of canned tomato soup and instead of putting fresh avocado slices in it they put a glob of guacamole in it with some cream. It was very weird and tasted like Cholula hot sauce. Oh and there wasn't a single tortilla strip in the entire soup. How is it tortilla soup with no tortillas?? I had a couple spoonfuls and decided I just couldn't eat anymore of it. I went home with a tummy ache and I never ever get tummy aches from food.  My husband wasn't impressed with his food either. The only good thing I can think of regarding the food was the crispy tortilla shell of the gringos tacos. That was good but I didn't like their salsa on the taco itself.   Plus they didn't bring any silverware or napkins until we asked for them after all our food got to the table. The runner brought the soup out to me without a spoon. They didn't refill our waters during our dining time there and it was also hard to flag them down to get the check.   I really don't understand how this place has such a high rating. It's mind boggling.",

It's not a large spot but it can hold it down. I've never been here when it's been really packed, I've always been able to find a table without a wait.   I recommend ordering a taco platter because you get 3 tacos of choice with rice & beans. It's a great choice when you want to try new tacos.   I've have the carne asada fries and it was delicious! I think anything on the menu is delicious! It's just a cute restaurant, it's vibrant always friendly service and quality of food is always great!

Part of the reason is they were holding some sort of an event there. The other reason was because there were a couple of kids running around screeching at the top of their lungs.   I'd visit here again. Hopefully next time it's a little quieter and perhaps they'll invest in a blender so they can blend their margaritas.",

Apparently, I had not ordered the right foods. A friend of mine took me to the taco truck at Downtown Container Park and ordered beef and chicken gringo tacos and once I tried them, I was totally hooked. I am so happy I live so close to this location in the Gramercy because can get them anytime I want now. Every person I've introduced them to (whenever I had visitors, I take them there when we're not feeling like going anywhere far) has loved them.  I like to come here and get gringo tacos, street corn, and either micheladas or beers and maybe - if we're feeling a little adventurous - some tequila shots. It's the perfect environment and food for a hangover or for a casual dinner with friends or a date.",

If you aren't friends with the staff, don't expect to get great service, rather it will be mediocre at best. We thought since we were latinos too we'd at least get more one-on-one time. One of my kids ordered the street tacos. We were told they would be bigger than the ones on the street and weren't. They were the exact same size for 3 times the price! And we went during the non-peak hours. We ordered another plate which I can't remember the name but it was a hot mess. Almost like it was all tossed together on the plate. The presentation was awful. We waited a long time for our meals. They were very pricey too. Which I guess is because of the location. We definitely will not be back. Save your $!",

Had the tiny burrito (al pastor) pretty good, but the price for the burrito $$$ and the taco $$$ yikes.  so expensive. Tortilla soup was not good. Tastes more like enchilada sauce. I will go back since their street corn is great and it's closer to home. Don't mind paying the price but make it a bigger burrito! :)",

We ordered the elote, quesadilla, carne Asada, lengua, & adobada. The meat was cooked well. Not to mention some of the best micheladas I've ever tried. Pinches has daily specials, taco Tuesday's & happy hours. To top it off, the interior is awesome, music is Fun, outdoor seating is nice, & just an overall clean restaurant. I hope to return with the same great first experience we had.",

    "text": "Underwhelmed is what I would describe my experience at Pinches. I don't know what all the hype is about with the food. I came in expecting a decent portion size and way better tortillas for the tacos. I ordered the combo plate for the tacos, and a corn on the cob.  Nothing great about the retried beans and rice that come with the plate. The beans seriously tasted like they were reheated 3-4 times and had no creaminess to them. To each their own with the beans consistency but you get what I mean.  For my tacos I chose 1 carne, 1 chicken mole, 1 fish. All three of my tortillas for the tacos were almost underdone tasting. I truly understand an authentic flour tortilla press shell, but just something about it was not cooked all the way thru. I have made better carne at home. Nothing seasoned or amazing about it. I expected more of a grill taste to it versus chewy. Chicken mole was nice flavor, but way to much sauce, not enough chicken. And The slaw for the fish taco was just weird. I don't even know how to explain it. The flavor over killed the fish, let alone I couldn't even find the fish. The corn on the cob was a great street corn. I have no complaints. Whatever corn they use is very juicy and they have all the flavors balanced.   And now that I have looked at Yelp reviews of other tacos, my boyfriend and I were not offered any sauces for tacos... this is probably another factor as to why I didn't care for the tacos. I like spicy. So I would have liked to added something, or even have a lime to squeeze on top.   Definitely don't recommend this place if you are looking for \"authentic tacos.\"  I think a lot of people just like the happy hour and Taco Tuesday specials.",

The gringo taco was like a stale cheese taco with lettuce and tomato. The only thing I liked was the strawberry Fanta. The service sucked, our server asked for our drink orders then said hold on she'll be right back, a different girl came back 10 mins later and took our entire order. 15 mins later the original server rushed back to take our order and said she forgot about us. All the while I watch another server stand at a table for 10+ minutes chatting it up, leaves for 10 then comes back to chat for another 10 mins. I seriously sat there an hour and watched everyone else get service and I couldn't even get a refill on my drink. Then a different girl comes to our table with a mouth full of food to check on us. When we asked her to split the bill she said she can but we'd have to wait when we said that would be fine she said are you sure cause it'll be like 10minutes or more. Tacky and careless staff everywhere.",

Still, I enjoyed the chicken, the gringo, and the adobada. If they open a location on the other side of town we might become regulars. If you live in the area, go here instead of that other taco chain, it won't disappoint.",

While there are other things on the menu; I usually keep it simple when I visit: tacos and margaritas.

The meat is delicious, I got the Asada taco plate. The meat was fire and the tortillas are freshly handmade and they were amazing. Needed some lemon, they didn't have a salsa bar or anything so you have to ask. But it's pretty cool place.   Service was exceptional but not gonna lie this place is pretty pricey. $2.50 for tacos I believe they have $2 taco specials during happy hour but it's not for all tacos, only a couple meats like chicken and such. Asada isn't included in the special nor lengua... It was $4.25 for a lengua taco. 1 TACO!! Lol THATS FREAKING CRAZY!!!   I got the Asada plate and it was like 10$ or so not bad and my boo got an Asada torta and a lengua taco. He thought the torta was a lil mushy, just not what he's used to I guess.   We spent like $45 for us 2 for dinner here. Not what we were expecting on getting tacos but it's cool. We're not cheap .. but we are from LA and there's great taco places every where and all of them are like $1 .. lol so when I think of tacos that's what I think of paying. But it's  hard to find good taco places in Vegas that's why you find spots like these that are hella overpriced. They should at least have like taco Tuesday and during their happy hour make all tacos available for the $2 special. Bring in more business instead of pushing it away with the ridiculous prices. It's tacos   This place is good, but if you want some good tacos for a lot better price go to Tacos El Gordo. It may be a little more hood and not white washed and fancy and boujee but they have good tacos and for a good price. So does La Bonita Supermarkets.",

    "text": "I can easily say I've found my new favorite taco joint. I had been eyeing this place up for a while now and I'm so glad I finally stopped in for happy hour. They have a daily happy hour from 3-7pm which includes $2 tacos and $4 drinks. Not all tacos are included on happy hour though so be sure to ask your server before you order. My favorite tacos we had were their gringo tacos which includes shredded beef, cheese, lettuce, tomato, and chipotle sauce in a hard taco shell. They were absolutely fantastic!!! So glad our server recommended them because they weren't on the menu (except for briefly being mentioned as a possible upgrade on the taco plate combo). Also, if you love spicy hot sauce, ask your server for a side of the habanero sauce. It was so tasty! Looking forward to trying this place again in the future. Everything on their menu sounds delicious so I must try it all!",

    "text": "Located in the corner of a plaza is this Mexican foodie gem, Pinches Tacos. I was hungry for a snack on the road and boy was I glad this popped on my Yelp App because I would have not see this place driving by.  Once I enter this restaurant, my eyes were greeted by a nicely rustic and contemporary street decor. The first thing you see if the \"food truck\" located on your right. It's great you can see the cooks at work through the glass wall. The bar is nicely constructed and I love the fence in the middle of the restaurant. This is a big room restaurant, it can fit a lot of people!  I was nicely greeted by a gentleman and somehow convinced myself to sit-down instead of take-out. Happy hour all night... $4 shots, micheladas, margaritas and $2 tacos (select only). I got a shot, michelada, lengua and adobada tacos and my friend got a shot, margarita, pescado and pollo mole tacos. The michelada was nicely spiced, I loved the spices on the rim. Lengua was very well composed, not a lot of bland taste (I've experienced most places to not compliment the lengua too well) which was delicious. The adobada were so packed with taste, I never thought I'd like that taco as I have never ordered it as where. My friend's fish tacos were delish, crispy and well-complimented with a red cabbage slaw.   My only complaint is that I do wish the tacos were double wrapped as the juices and sauce cause the taco shell to rip very easily. I found myself using the fork and piecing the taco back together. Not a big deal to the overall experience but definitely something that bothered me a bit!  I'd highly recommend this place and will return soon. Great wait staff by the way!",

    "text": "We had a friend come into town so we decided to try this place out! It's easy to find and looks great from the outside. When you walk in, the set up is very fun and the place offers a very chilled vibe. The kitchen area looks like a food truck and the seating area kind of like a patio with a garden gate. There's also a big version of 3 in a row, if that floats your boat.  I was a little confused when we walked in because there were 3 girls leaning up against the food truck, chatting and drinking, I thought they were guests who'd just made themselves very comfortable, but no, they were staff! It would have been nice to have been greeted a little more professionally but thankfully one had enough time in between sips to tell us to 'sit wherever'. Drinks came quickly enough from the bar and for food, we went for the flautas to share and we each had the taco combination which came with 3 tacos, beans, rice and chips. The flautas tasted good, but they were served cold which was a shame. We all had different tacos and all commented that they were OK, very average. Meat a little overdone, not seasoned properly and the kitchen was a little stingy with the amount of shrimp. The taco combos were also served on a plastic plate with separated sections, kind of like what you'd be given if you were a child, or in prison. A normal plate would have been great.  The staff were friendly enough but I was a little shocked by how 'differently' they do things here. For example, a guy who I thought was a guest passed our table and asked if we were all okay before returning to his table of girlfriends, turns out he worked there. And the lady who served us our bill came over, purse in arm, before returning to chilling with a guy at the bar. Idk if she had clocked out and was doing our main server a favour or what. Very strange and not what I personally appreciate, but if you like casual dining and extremely casual service, then this might be for you! As for me, I think we'll try something else next time we crave some tacos!",

The service continued to go down the shitter after they figured they weren't getting a  20% tip and after all that I would've at least picked up the customer service as an apology..

So imagine my excitement when I learned that they opened a new location in Spring Valley!   My boyfriend and I went here for dinner last night (Wednesday). We were immediately greeted by who we later on learned as \"Javier\", one of the Anaya brothers - creator of the awesome Gringos Tacos. He gave us a couple of suggestions from their menu so we decided to get the combo to be able to try almost most of it: Gringos, AlPastor, Asada, Shrimp and Fish Tacos. Everything tasted wonderful! It was so delicious we told everyone we know that they must try this place.   However their grand opening might not be until mid-November (or so we're told), so if you do decide to swing by, just remember to BYOB. Overall, this place has impressive food and it's always a plus when you are treated like family. This will definitely keep us coming back for more!",

They were bursting with flavor and we loved them. They're smaller street style tacos so order a few if you want to leave with a full stomach. Their margaritas were good too. Service was great. Everyone was super friendly and helpful. We will be back for sure.",

    "text": "Came here on a business lunch today and the lady that took our order was super rude. It was my first time here and didn't realize that you order at the counter so when she came around and started to hand menus out she started with the people that came in after us. I told her that there was me and my associate that would be dining and she rudely responded that she didn't give us a menu because my associate was on the phone. It wasn't what she said, but the tone in which she said it and the facial expression that she made that was so rude. Then after ordering I go to the fountain drink machine to  choose a beverage and most of the selections are grayed out/not available. I chose a beverage that wasn't grayed out and as it starts to pour it stops and the icon turns gray. So I make another selection. Same thing. On the third time it happened I went to tell her but she came around the corner looking super annoyed and talked to me in such a condescending way telling me that the drinks that are grayed out mean they are out. I explained to her that they weren't gray when I chose those drink so I thought something was wrong with the machine. She just started pushing buttons and chose a drink for me and says \"here this one works.\" Again, not what she said, but how she said it. Aside from her rude customer service, the gentleman who brought our food out was super nice and the food was ok. Wont be going here again and from what I can see on other reviews I'm not the only one who's had a bad customer service experience.",

It took too long for follow up. Waitress didn't even know the tequila menu. Asked what my price range was (tasteless)  The waitress screwed up our bill 4 times.  Mixing other tables with ours.  Also put generic items on the bill (seems deceptive and even fraudulent)  Don't buy into the hype. There are far better places in terms of service, quality and atmosphere",

Al Pastor was quite good but I've had better al Pastor tacos elsewhere.  Carnitas was boring and a little dry.

    "text": "I had no idea that this was the second location for Pinches Tacos in Vegas. Maybe one day go downtown Container Park. Truth everything about this location screams of all the things I enjoy about legit street tacos. Not only talking about the food but the atmosphere plus really nice when you can sit inside not just find plastic bucket sit on or on the curb. The employees are awesome and five stars all around.  Thankful my brother told me about this place for legit street tacos. Otherwise I would have never have found it. The location it off the beaten path (although notice second visit they were putting name on main sign right off russell) cause from Russell Rd no matter direction coming from hidden and since part of office building or Gramercy throws you for loop even more. Once you come around the building find one of the hidden gems in Vegas.   Both visits all about the tacos. 11 different proteins choose from so there literally is a taco for everyone. So far I have tasted the Pollo Mole, Asada, Lengua, Pescado, and Camaron. Each time got the combination plate (selection of three different ones of your choice) comes with refried beans and rice. The refried beans and rice are awesome. The refried beans the thing stands out of not so much over puree. Still whole beans in it rather then all smooth not fan of that style. The rice was solid. Tacos Lengua had always been my favorite. The Lengua is very very good. Both the Pescado and Camaron they both battered the same. I love it. Add squeeze of fresh lime juice. The most refreshing fish tacos every going get in the desert. Pollo Mole sauce little heavy for me. Mole thing unique taste. I would pass if order it again.  The Asada was solid. The tortilla, toppings, salsa, and everything tasted fresh. I could have eating tacos all day and night if I could. Me there that good only thing want too order.   They even had all the tradition mexican sodas orange flavor to coke all in glass bottles. Also have other bottle drinks plus cool coke fountain machines that choose from eight different flavor cokes. The personality in this place is awesome. You place order looks like food truck or taco truck in this case. Talk about decor. I love love love it. It has the whole dawn of the dead. The skull bones from artwork on the walls, the pictures above the food truck, even the hanging strings of lights, the tables wooden rustic tables, and cool sign point all different directions. The bar area is small but they do have widescreen for games. Talk about awesome HH one that need come back. Tuesday have $2 tacos HH. Must one Tuesday for me. The weather warmer outside not really patio area but places that can sit down enjoy the food and weather.   The service is nothing but five stars. I believe one of the owners. It was my first time he explained everything too me clearly, and made me feel welcome first time. He checked see everything was going couple times and leaving thank me for coming in. Everyone came across really friendly, cool vibe, and made whole experience that much better. Second visit the guy remember my face was like back for more tacos. Hell yay man!!! I just love small business owners that feeling care about each customer experience.",

    "text": "I'm sad and disappointed that I'm only able to give pinches a 2 star when it easily should of been a 5 star! This was my husbands and I first time in and we had been referred here by many family and friends. Pinches is a cute taco spot with a great vibe and delicious food! The tacos are truly amazing but unfortunately I can't say the same for the customer service.  We came in around 10:10-10:15 the latest on Saturday night (4/7/18) and instantly feel in love and the place had people every where and even had karaoke going on.  We were seated on the other side where it was much more calmer by the front windows towards the right (if you have just walked in the front door) anyways we ended up with chavo -younger gentleman medium built with a large black bread - he was polite but he has the worst customer service.  He seemed very distracted with the other side where the karaoke and the bar was happening. Now yes there was a good amount of people in pinches but not too the point that we had to be ignored and forgotten. We order for starters chips, salsa and guacamole, 2 taco combos and a Mexican corn off the cob. We received our food in a orderly manner but chavo was too busy with watching the karaoke and forgot about us and our order. He only came back to the table every 15-20 mins if that and after receiving our taco combos and eating about half way through them we still didn't receive our starter. So we did not receive our chips and guacamole and we didn't receive our corn either at this point. After reminding him of both again and after already eating  more than half our taco combos, he only still brings the chips and NO CORN  was every brought out. At this point we were over the situation and finished our meal.  Again Chavo is no where to be found. It wasn't until i went up to the front where i had to ask him for our bill so we could leave. At the end he got no Tip and when i asked for the manager from another women she stated the manager wouldn't be in until Sunday. So I hope the owner and manager see this and i will be contacting the manager Sunday. Customer service is a 100% must in my book and for the poor service We received tonight has turned us off from pinches and I'm sad to say we will not be returning. Thanks chavo for making us feel like we were an inconvenience for you since the party side is where you obviously wanted to be.",

Ahhh, there it was after making 2 trips trying to find this place.  We were all seated and while waiting for the food to come, we had a plate full of chips, spicy pico de gallo, and fresh guacamole to go with our blood  orange margaritas. A must try!  Taco Tuesday, tacos@$2/piece. We ordered the gringo, mole, Al Pastor, grilled chicken tacos, asada. It was delicious!!! Each taco   had distinctive flavors. I love them all but ... If mole is not one of your favorite Mexican dish, then this may not be your best choice of taco either. The mole sauce was a bit on the thicker side and had deeper, richer texture. I  might skip the mole tacos next time. The menu is pretty extensive. We went  for taco Tuesday so we had tacos only. I can't really say which one is my favorite since we did not order all the tacos on the menu. If I had to pick among what we had that night, my favorite was the Al pastor tacos ( marinated, slow cooked pork with such amazing  flavor and  the gringo tacos (hard shell , marinated chix light filling with fresh tomatoes and sauce.) It seems like the happy hour is popular.  Overall: loving the tacos, reasonably priced, extensive menu selections, ambience( casual), happy hour! Can't wait to bring friends and enjoy the FOOD!!!",

Both Javier & Sal took care of me beyond my expectations with great service and food. If you're looking for a great meal, atmosphere, and service you have to visit Pinche's Tacos. No doubt you'll become a regular. Thanks again Pinches!!!    Phil ur Delivery Dude",

Loved the green salsa on the tacos.  We were a little upset that they didn't serve a frozen margarita, but the ones they did serve were pretty good.  The major negative was how noisy the place was. Part of the reason is they were holding some sort of an event there. The other reason was because there were a couple of kids running around screeching at the top of their lungs.   The food was good and the servings were good size.  I'd visit here again. Hopefully next time it's a little quieter.",

The gringo taco, nopales taco and chicken mole taco were all delightful. The beef taquitos are a win too!! The sopes left much to be desired and the rice and beans are subpar.   The atmosphere is awesome and the patio is great! Happy hour is excellent. I can't imagine a better way to spend Saturday evening then a scrumptious margarita and tacos al fresco.   We will definitely return. Again and again I'm sure. The service is warm and friendly.   The first time we went, there was a kids menu...the second time around the server didn't really know what we were talking about. On our first visit, my son got taquitos with rice and beans and a yummy pineapple Agua Fresca. Also, they do not have highchairs. This is a major bummer. They do have booster seats but they aren't appropriate for younger kids (under 2). The straps don't tighten much.   Go check out pinches for casual delicious food!",

It had 3 tacos, beans, rice, and tortilla chips. The shrimp, al pastor, and carne asada taste great. The best part, they make their tortillas in house. I would definitely be back.",

I work in customer service and in the tipping industry and when you do not provide me with ANY customer service do not expect anything. This server had no personality and messed up the order. Half of the food came out then after 5 minutes one of the appetizers came out. Then found out the other half of the order wasn't even put in to the kitchen so took awhile for my friends to get their food. We also ordered some drinks which never came out. Had to ask more then twice to get a refill as well. 2 of our friends ordered Horchata and our server told them it would be 5 minutes. They never got the drinks, she didn't even offer to get him something else. She did not once apologize for the inconvenience. I have been here a few times and always tell family and friends about how great this place is. This is the first time I have left disappointed.",

    "text": "To start off with the good, the restaurant's interior is invigorating. They actually have a food cart parked inside of the restaurant that you can order from. They also had a $14 bottomless mimosa deal that almost pulled me in. This place would be a fun vibe for a night out.  Now to the not so good. While we were ordering, we asked a preferential question to our server, to which they responded that they had not been working there long so they didn't know (maybe a menu tasting for your servers wouldn't be such a bad idea). They deferred to the table before who had ordered the Chilaquiles, so we went with that. I would have let this slide, had the following not occurred.   For the price I was paying, I expected a healthy amount of food. However, when our food arrived, my jaw nearly hit the floor. What I had set in front of me was a small (like, REALLY small) pile of mush-looking Chilaquiles on a tri-section plastic plate. The other two sections were used for the tiny piles of Guacamole and Cream that came with the meal. To make matters worse, a friend at the table had the same dish, but nearly 50% larger of a portion (still would not have been enough to satisfy a normal adult). Taking it a step further, taste was underwhelming and the plate had probably been left to cool for 5-10 minutes. These incidents were not isolated to the Chilaquiles either.  If I'm going to pay $10+ for a child's size portion of food, at least serve on something that doesn't make me feel like I'm in a prison cafeteria.",

    "text": "Second (and last) year I had a bunch of people (20-30 people) meet there for my birthday. Last year, it was great. Service was 125% better than I could have imagined or asked for. I was super thankful for what you guys did.   However, this year wasn't quite the same experience. We were asked to sit outside in the court yard (not on their property) because they didn't have the room because it was \"taco Tuesday\". Cool, I'm more than happy to help out because in the past, I have gotten great service and the weather was nice so it wasn't an unreasonable request. However, I went up to the bar three times and every time I was waiting to order food and drinks, I listened to one (of the three) bartenders we were dealing with complaining rudely about \"the big party in the courtyard\" and using profanity in reference about us (\"this is fucking annoying\", \"why can't all these fucking people go away\" are some of the gems I heard).They had no idea why we were there (for my birthday) but they complained openly about us amongst each other right in front of us. Since at least 20 of the 30 people in our party work at the same major strip property in the service industry, we make it a point to be respectful and tip well. I even put all the tables together myself (since it was in the court yard I felt I shouldn't ask anyone to do it for me), because I get that they were busy and I had a large party with me.   Every single person was a huge fan of the food, but almost all of them complained about the bartenders attitude. It was super off-putting for me. Last year, my bill was about $35 and we tipped close to the same amount (for two people, not the entire party) and this year, my bill was $46 for seven tacos and two drinks. My girlfriend only tipped $7 and I think that was probably $3 too much for the bad attitudes we all received. Like I mentioned, we had anywhere from 25-30 people there and the checks were averaging $20-$30 per two people. So roughly, $375 in food and drinks, and we all heard the constant complaints about us like we weren't standing right in front of the s I was pretty embarrassed I was dead set on having people come there a second year in a row due to how the bar tenders treated us. I'll be super clear about this...we did NOT have any dealings with anyone INSIDE. Only three  female bartenders (one had large gauges if the owners care to read this) outside.   Anyway, the as mentioned before the food was great and the gringo tacos were as good as ever. I just won't ever order an alcoholic beverage or go to the bar ever again. Next year, I will find a new taco place to have a get together for my birthday because the bartenders made it clear to us that have no interest in helping anyone unless they want one drink and to leave right away.   Bottom line is, if you are looking to have a group event here, I would steer clear. But if you and one other person are looking for some pretty good food, this wouldn't be a bad option.  I probably won't be back for awhile because I am embarrassed for asking my friends and family to come here, but I love the gringo taco so I know I'll eat there again at some point.   Hope this review helps.",

The decor reminds me of a food truck park too. Log picinic benches, wire fencing, and bright colors and thing hanging down. I had the chicken tortilla soup and carne Asada fries and both were tremendous! The chicken tortilla soup was creamy and delicious. Would definitely return for more.   A little surprising but their chips were pretty subpar. A little stale and a bit on the thicker side =\\",

Also the bartender had told me that it was happy hour all day on Sunday! I thought this is great, well not so much....  I go back there on a Sunday,and I expected the same treatment and pricing as I got the last time I was there. Well no apparently on Sundays it is happy hour after 3pm only so my friend went there before us and was not happy about that.... so we come back after 3 and sit at the bar. I ask about happy hour, I'm told two different things by two people but it was okay bc they where just like $1 difference in there description of happy hour, but they both said shots where on special. So we drink then we get our bill.... we where getting charged $12 for a shot of casamingos blanco! I said excuse me but the last time I was in here for happy hour it was $4 a shot, the guy said oh that's only if our manager/owner was here.... ummm what!!?? I said well I would have have ordered them if I knew the prices tripled when the manager/owner is not here :/ needless to say I will not be referring my friends here or coming back. The food is good and so are the drinks but not for the price. I work on the strip in a Mexican place and we are not even that expensive! Esp if it is \"happy hour\"   UPDATE: we go to try and give this place another shot. Today we walked in and sat at the bar and watched the bartender smoke a cigarette in the patio area. It was a good 10 min, but are patient and so we stayed. She walks in and doesn't wash her hands and grabs menus the and says what can I get you? I say I'll have a water for sure then idk yet I'm still looking. My bf says the same. She then says \"you have to drink to sit at the bar.\" (We are the only 2 people at the bar) I say okay we plan to order. We order food then drinks right after. She never smiled and made us feel unwelcome and DIDN'T WASH HER HANDS AFTER SHE SMOKED! Great food but the service is horrible, and that just kills the vibe. This girls name was Christy.",

Unfortunately I wish the same amount of effort was put into the quality if their food. I had the carne asada tacos that were $3 EACH! and they only came with 1 skimpy tortilla. The meat was very bland. When I asked for limes the waitress pulled them from behind the bar and they had dried out from sitting out too long.  The customer service was very good and they made you feel right at home. If you were looking for a place to hang out with friends with a good atmosphere this would be a good place to go. Granted I did not have anything else on the menu but my experience with the tacos has steered me from coming back.",

I ordered 2 tacos one chicken and one carne asada the chicken taco was 2 bites and it had very little chicken but all kinds of cilantro and onions the carne asada even less meat and still more cilantro and onions. I paid $7.95 for these 2 tacos $3.30 for the chicken and $3.95 for the Carne asada and it was honestly mediocre the chicken fried out and the carne asada was not very tasty at all. I've had better Mexican food Algombertos and even Robertos is better.  Authentic food it is not this place is a joke and for the price you would expect it to be half ways decent.  $11.95 for a Asada Quesadilla what a joke and 2 bite tacos also a joke.",

The energy too of the workers and diners.  There's a food truck in here!  Whatta display - it's cool :D.    Comarz and I swung around to eat here cuz ... 1. I had never been.  2. She went to the one in Downtown and wanted to see this one.  3. We were hungry.  Good enough; let's go eat!  We sat at the bar.  There's a wall which opens up to views of an exterior patio, business buildings, and more palm trees yay!  People can sit outside of the bar - limited seating.  But how fun is that set up?!  Don't ask me about the name of the place though :P.  I just learned it.  Do your own questioning elsewhere.  They're serious about making you feel at home.  Especially with the food okay.  You know home cooking is meant to taste a lot better cuz it's made with love right.  Slurp-u-lous flavor tacos found here.  Family recipes!  Come try!  Also, met Javi and Asia.  Tossed a couple tequila shots like we do in Uncle's backyard.  Thanks for the home feel guys!",

We will wait for chips and salsa and Oder.   But no. Nobody comes back. Three bartenders all within 10 feet of us just gab and walk around. We stare at one, she stares back but clearly isn't interested in asking us if we'd like to have anything other than water.   We end up jokingly saying \"okay if nobody offers to help within 5 minutes let's leave.\"  5-6 minutes pass, we can't believe it...literally 5-7 employees on their feet looking around in random spots near us. Yet all clearly not looking to assist us.   We left. Came to Tony's. Totally worked out for the best.    Bring in Bar Rescue!",

This review is not to put down the restaurant, but for management to recognize their shortcomings.  First of, parking was really bad, there was no parking when we got there, the layout of the buildings and parking was just off.  So, having to walk quite a distance, expectation level went up quite a bit.  When we got in the restaurant, ambiance was pretty cool..... Til we ordered.... the cashier, which I'm guessing is the manager or the owner, who was busy on his phone,  had a little girl behind the register, finish the transaction. There was a cook in the kitchen with an earpiece dangling on his ear while preparing food.  Keep in mind this was our first time here, so we didn't know what to do.. after we ordered and paid, I didn't know what to do, so I had to interrupt him on his phone and ask if I was to find our own seat or to wait by the register, and had to ask how they were going to be able to know which order was which.  Food quality was terrible, for the price we paid, I expected to have average food, sad to say it was below average. There was no meat in the burrito, rice had crunchy bits, which had been sitting out for quite some time.   All in all I will not be coming back to this restaurant and I hope that owners or management can see this and fix their issues.",

I didnt see where she was pointing at because we were across the room so I asked her if she was pointing to the drink station area. She said \"nevermind\" walked away...

They didn't serve alcohol at that time so they let my husband bring in a 6 pack so that was kinda cool. Service however was great. The boss was very attentive and friendly. Prices are cheap.

    "text": "If you have more that 15 people in your party they do not want your business and the manager was very adamant about that with me.  On Tuesday, a group of us went to have dinner together, we started at 15 people and would up being 25 plus.  We did not care about having to stand and eat; it was all about being together.  We were at 5 long tables, long counter and 1 separate table.   Instated of turning 3 other tables, the staff decided to seat other people who had to have our group hover other them.  (Hope they enjoyed all of our conversations)    I ordered food at 6:35pm and at 7:15 after watching other people be served and I asked where our food was.  I was told that it would be out shortly... Next I was asked for our orders again and the server said they are working on it.  At 7:35pm we got our food and another server said, you just ordered at 7:15 so that was quick service, then found out that there computer lost order and so what, you got your food is what I was told.  I spoke to manager Francisco who was just not in the customer service mood and told me, that his sit down restaurant ( and this is not a real sit down restaurant as all food orders are placed at a counter and servers bring food out to you) did serve me quickly and defended the 7:15 pm order placement. That blew up in his face when I showed him my credit card charge at 6:35pm.  His response to me was we that cannot be the right time for your order.  Again, he was not customer service friendly and the said I don't want you large party business and was very adamant about that.   I surely will not be going back to this place and will share this experience with all my friends.",

Between the 2 of us, we had asada, carnitas, mole, pescado, and camaron (beef, pork, chicken, fish and shrimp). Each tastier than the next. The menu is a little short on traditional starters, so we had the chips, salsa, and guac, but that was tasty to warm up the tummy for the yummy that was about to follow. Definitely want to come back to try the other options (I'm going for the burrito or flauta next). Wait staff also was super helpful, very friendly, and very attentive.",

The chips were warm and fresh and the pico had the perfect amount of kick. We ordered queso to cheese up the matter, but I didn't care for it. It's almost like a smidge of meat chili was added to the queso.. The fish taco was average..it didn't knock my socks off. The corn on the cob is amazing! Best ever! Be sure to try the guac...it's the perfect texture- not too creamy nor too chunky. I've been here three times and have had great service each time.",

My mom & I walked in, were greeted promptly by a guy who handed us menus and advised us to sit anywhere we wanted.  Now, I guess to be fair to him, and the girl that was also serving, the NCAA Championship game was on.  So, the end of the game and the three other tables in the restaurant were taking up a lot of their time.  Anyway, we perused the menu for a couple of minutes, decided what we wanted, put the menus down, and waited for someone to come by to take our order.  And waited .. and waited.  We sat there for a good five minutes and nobody ever visited our table to take a drink order, ask if we had any questions .. Nothing.  After the server walked to the bar to deliver food on a couple occasions, said 'hi' to his buddy and deftly avoided our table, we decided to get up and leave.  I'm a sous chef and I am very forgiving when a place is busy; but this was unacceptable.  Bummer, because I've heard good things about the food here.",

Just alright, nothing to brag about, nothing to make us want to go back. We ordered 1 alpastor torta, 1 alpastor taco, 1 shrimp taco, 1 breakfast burrito and mexican corn and still cost $30 after a military discount!   I asked how big the tacos were, the guy taking our order said \"definitely bigger than street tacos\" .. he even used his hands to describe the size.  The tacos were very small, like street taco small, like only 2 bites small and were $4 each. The shrimp taco had 1 piece of shrimp chopped up. I can get same quality food from a taco truck for half the price. Not worth it.   Breakfast burrito was very bland. Tried adding more pico and mexican crema.. nothing! Again, not impressed. I've had a better tasting breakfast burrito from Roberto's for half the price.  The corn had a good taste but was very watery/soupy.   Worst $30 we've spent on food! The door says real mexican food.. HAHAHA! Not even close!",

This location was hard to find, it is back in be corner of the plaza, you can't see it from the streets... I drove around both plazas for a while until I finally saw the sign!   The place is really cute, they have a food truck on the inside, colorful tables and chairs, a bar area for 21+  I got 2 of the beef tongue, 2 pastor, 1 chicken, 1 shrimp (helped a friend out with this one) and corn on the cob. The pastor and the chicken were very tasty! These two stood out the most, the rest of the tacos were alright. The corn was amazing, huge corn ear for $3... The cheese and chili on top were perfect! Also got the hibiscus tea which was very refreshing.   Service was great, the staff were very friendly, very fun and chill environment. They do have happy hour were certain tacos are $2.   However... If you just want good tacos going to a food truck would be less expensive. The beef tongue was over $3 each... Can get the same flavor for cheaper at a food truck. I do recommend checking this place out for the decor and the pastor and chicken!!",

I was excited to take my mother to this place since I had a great time here 3wks ago, I was baffled by the icy treatment we received the second we stepped in. No \"Hello\" or any greeting of some sort. The staff was standing by the register, we had no idea where to sit since there were only a couple tables occupied, total of 4patrons. We find a table, a filthy one with left over half eaten shrimp from a previous patron. Once we sat a lady approached us, literally pushed off the shrimp to the floor with the menus, threw them at us NO Hello and said \"let me get a rag\" barely cleaned off the table and quickly walked off saying \"order up front\" having no clue what 'front' meant I was simply asking \"where, excuse me \" twice but she completely ignored me with an attitude. I get up to find her at the register, on her cell phone and asked another staff member what's the 'front' ? She rudely responds quickly, \"here where the cash register is\" no explanation as how to order and their system. I explain this was not what I experienced 3wks ago, she said because at night we have MORE servers, I responded, confused \" last time I was only served by the Bartender and there was no one around at 4pm\" she quickly said I had no idea what I was talking about. With an attitude! I could not believe the treatment I received today from your staff! I am appalled 100% because I had a nice experience 3wks ago here!  So unprofessional, definitely not clean, and we felt disrespected and with a total of 4 other patrons at 3:23pm, 7/30/18!!! Wow, 1 star so I can type a review. But this place does not deserve a star because the staff is unbelievably rude! I am in the food/beverage industry and Vegas Strong for 24yrs! Never have I ever experienced this treatment in vegas! Bad place here in vegas! And bad representation for The Gramercy. They need to train their staff on customer service immediately! And health department needs to visit this place ASAP!!!!",

What offened us was that they were angry and told us not to come back because 3 people never got their food due to their systems being down and we all paid sperately. I could understand if we had a waitress but at this resturant customer orders like taco bell... You walk up to a counter pay then walk away. No menus on the table.  The tacos was ok. Lengua could use some seasoning and the tortillas do fall apart.  The atmosphere was nice and management was nice in the beginning. But when it all ended they told 25 people not to come back because they didn't like that we paid separately. I understand their systems were down and that's why 3 people never got their food but instead of being mad at 25 paying customers who would have come back change they should have changed their tune.....  After several in our group posted a review on FB Piches started insulting us. Not a professional management style.",

Lots of seating.   I ordered two Carne Asada tacos that come with their green salsa, cilantro, and onions. Their tortillas are made FRESH. Because when I got mine they were smoking hot!!! I also got the Mexican corn also known as the Elote. Corn on the cob slathered with mayo, cheese, butter and chili powder. Elote is my weakness and it was sooo damn good and the corn was sweet. The asada was well marinated and very tender.   Bae got the Al Pastor burrito. It had beans, avocado, onions wrapped up in a warm tortilla. Also came with a side of chips and salsa. Devoured the food. It was really good. Ending it with horchata ice cream and friend churros. The food was great and I'd definitely come back.",

Unfortunately not my favorite, food was okay but nothing I would rave about or am dying to go back and get. Fell a bit short of great in my opinion. Decently priced plates and awesome specials.",

The waitress also was too distracted taking shots with bar customers rather than taking our order.  In addition, their fryer was broke so there were many menu items not available.  The staff overall was very immature and had high school mentality.   The only thing I enjoyed about this experience was their decor of graffiti and the indoor taco truck was cool.  But not cool enough to suffer through the lack of service and below average food.",

Came in here for some tacos and an Elote, was appalled by their prices for everything. $5.25 for two small taquitos ten dollars for two taco plate.  We went with the Elote which is Mexican corn. The corn tasted old. It was slathered in some strange sauce, covered in a weird cheese with no additional flavor. I struggled through it and immediately regretted coming here. Never again, & I hope you don't make the same mistake we did.",

I tried the white peach margarita and it was just awesome. They definitely do not go light on the tequila either. They do run happy hour specials with two dollar tacos. I tried a variety of tacos and they were all very good. But this place is worth coming to for the margaritas alone.",

The fish tacos are the best fish tacos i've ever had. They have this crunchy slaw that makes them even more fresh tasting than they already are. I don't live anywhere near an elote man so I also come here when I am craving corn. Try the blood orange marg while you're at it or the horcata if you don't drink.",

    "text": "Walking in, I was won over by the funky Dia de los Muerto decor melded with street art feel. Bright, airy and you can watch the ladies and gentlemen rolling fresh tacos in the window! There are several dining areas: their outdoor seating looked charming, dining room has 3 small tables & 2 large tables so it can accommodate large or small groups, there is a bar area & another eat-in area past the indoor taco truck. I thought it was a little confusing at first, do we order at the table, do we order at the truck? Eventually a server stopped by & got us going with Margaritas. I had the Blood Orange, it was good if not overly sweet for me.   On to the food, the beans and rice were both dry. Rice had a sweet garlic flavor that was subtle and good. Basically, skip the sides & make up for it with lots of tacos.  Tacos:  Al Pastor: 5/5 - tastes like summer, crisp carmelized pork, tomato sauce, plenty of cilantro & spice- a spicy tomato & onion puree was so yummy. The mix of soft corn tortilla with flavorful caramelized meat, crunch from raw onion with lots of cilantro, this was a standout!  Carnitas - 4/5 they were a-ok but def go with pico de gallo, the flavors go together so well!  Gringo Tacos- 3/5 in a crispy taco shell, complete with cheese and crisp fresh lettuce.  Carnitas, dry. Nice bite of cilantro. First we tried without the sauce and they were a 5/5 for me, then I ordered with the sauce and it just overwhelmingly SWEET, couldn't eat it. so with the sauce 1/5 from me. Would def order again, without sauce.  Camerones - 5/5 tender shrimp, crispy cabbage, just right in sweet and salty, lots of smokey paprika first, spicy little after note. Delish!  Notes for improvements would be, the table we were lucky to get (they were slammed for Taco Tuesday at 5:45pm, note to self!) was awkwardly located too near the line forming at the truck, because the line kept backing up and forming around our table. Kids coloring menus would also be a great offering! It was a cluster on Tuesday at 5:45, but we got a table- people lining up around our table not the best.  Management stopped and chatted with us for a few minutes, that was great! We'll be back again to try some more; glad to have this spot in our neighborhood!",

    "text": "Sorry guys, but this is another one of those places where I don't agree with the majority.   Located in the new Grammercy plaza on Russell and the 215, it is not visible from the street. You have to drive to the back of the building. Once inside, the decor is cute and has a Day of the Dead theme meets LA street art. There is a food truck looking counter to order to go, but if you want to eat in, you can just seat yourself.   SERVICE: Our waitress (didn't get her name) wasn't super friendly, but she was the only one waiting on ALL of the tables. She looked overwhelmed and I felt her pain as a former food server. I saw that other tables were still waiting for their drinks while we had already received ours. And the two women that came in and ordered to go were waiting over 15 minutes. My BF finally got our server to smile a bit when he paid for the tab and mentioned how busy she was.   FOOD:  I don't want to be mean or anything, but I didn't really care for the food. The rice was sooooo bland. Our tacos had liquid dripping from them, which made the tortilla soggy, which in turn made the taco fall apart. There was hardly any meat in the tacos. You could taste more onion and cilantro than anything else. The horchata and Mexican corn were the highlight of the meal.   I really wanted to like this place because of all the positive reviews. Even if I was in the area, this wouldn't be on my places to eat list. I guess I still have to drive to the north side of town to get decent tacos.",

From what it looked like, I think you order at the counter/bus and then pick a seat? I don't know because I only ordered take out.   We did 3 combination plates (3 tacos, rice, beans) at $9.50. The tacos are street style so they are smaller but the combination plate is sure to fill you up. All of the tacos were delicious. They even had a special one that was deep fried so it became a hard shell taco. All of us loved the fluffy rice and chunky beans...they even threw in a couple chips to scoop up the beans. The tortillas are soft and taste homemade. I really appreciated how they wrapped up each sauce in its own container and labeled which taco it belonged on to prevent the tacos from getting soggy. If you don't want to gnaw on a corn cob you can get your elotes in a bowl!   Great little taco spot. We will be back! I hope they get busy...I'm sure they rely solely on word of mouth or whatever marketing they're doing as I don't think they get much walk-in business (since their storefront is hidden)! The service was friendly, but I will admit I was not greeted right away and had one of those awkward \"where do I go to order\" moments.   HOT TIP: Happy hour- $4 dranks & $2 tacos!!!! FYI, apparently \"pinches\" is not a bad word ;X",

We started with some chips and salsa which were extremely fresh and amazing. I went with a margarita because tacos + margarita = match made in heaven. Man this margarita was GOOD! This wasn't your typical fake juice margarita. The lime was so intense and tart which really made the margarita stand out. As for the tacos, I went with the al pastor and the asada. Both were amazing! The al pastor was pretty spicy but so delicious and the asada was great as well. It was much more mild but provided a big punch of flavor! I can not wait to come back and try their other menu options. I'm especially excited to try the huevos rancheros! I will be coming back VERY soon!",

My mom ordered the tortilla soup and the chicken flautas.  I think what stands out most about this place is that everything is so fresh. You can taste the difference in quality compared to a lot of other places in town. They're open late which is convenient for those nights when you need good late night Mexican food or a good drink without the guilt that usually comes along with it.  Lastly I'd just like to throw out there that there churros might be better than Disneylands. And that's a bold claim. We'll definitely be back to try their breakfast soon.",

I've tried a few different tacos and sopas:  Chicken Mole, Adobada and Al Pastor.  While they were all good, the chicken mole tacos were the stand out!  Are you kidding me!?!? Chicken Mole tacos?!?!  Who does that?  They do and they do it well!    The quality is top-notch and while I'm not sure if they make the taco shells there, it sure tastes like they do.  They taste freshly made and are a little thicker which is just amazing.    For dessert I had the guava flan and it was amazing!  While I love flan, most of the ones I've had have more of a jello-like texture, this was creamy, almost like cheesecake.    This will be a regular place for me.",

    "text": "We went here for the first time after wanting to go here for awhile! We decided to take our daughter and grandson who cautioned us that it would be pretty pricey. We didn't listen because we wanted to have lunch with them but honestly, how much can Mexican food cost? Well we found out. First of all the ambiance is fun and it has a lot of great features about the Mexican culture. The taco truck in the front of the place was a cool addition. The Lotteria cards as table cards was a cool idea. The car seats as booth seating was pretty nice as well and the stringed lighting makes you feel like you're in a backyard in LA. We ordered 3 horchatas. They are great and I recommend them! However, you literally get a child size plastic to go cup of this drink. Thumbs down for presentation and portion on that. Then the home made guava flan came out. To me it was bland. You can't taste guava in there at all. So why even put it out there? Thumbs down. The flautas came out. Presentation was awesome! Portion was perfect and it was really really good! Two Thumbs up. Then the main course. So Asada tacos were pretty good. I do have to say the tortillas are decent but a little on the thick side and I like them thinner. We tried the chicken mole and it's good too but I don't recommend it as a taco. Just a dish with beans and rice because the sauce is too think to be in a taco. A very disappointing dish was the Al Pastor!! We got it in a burrito and taco style. They both fell flat and short from taste and quality. Just to let you know... A PERFECT Al Pastor should have pina chopped and marinated with the meat and the meat should be tender because of the acidity of the pineapple. Neither of these things happened and I found myself having the worse Al Pastor I've ever had in my life. Which is very upsetting because that happens to be my favorite meat. Beans and rice were fresh. All of the tortilla chips were overcooked and burnt! Even my nieto wouldn't eat them and he LOVES chips! So on to the service. We are greeted by a female server who was very helpful and friendly. I recommend keeping her because she's funny and pays attention to everything that's going on in that restaurant. I didn't get her name but she's crazy. In a good way. So I'm sure you'll figure it out. The other server who happens we to be pregnant, she was the opposite. She needs to go home and not work in an eatery with people. She didn't look like she wanted to be there, was quiet and looked tired, which again, if she's pregnant maybe she shouldn't work in that type of job. Especially as a safety issue because what if she falls!? She could hurt herself and baby.. She actually made the experience a little bad because she wasn't as friendly and upbeat as the place itself. I feel bad because I know it must be tiring to have to work but with the enormous amount of money being shelled out by patrons for your overpriced food, you really need to consider who is serving it! Our bill came and it was $82. Yes, $82. For 3 kid size horchatas, 2 bland flans, 2 flautas, 1 burrito, a taco combo plate, a kids quesadilla (which by the way we asked to gave a to go box so we could take it with us and the server never brought it put so we said forget it and left it behind) 7 asada tacos. It literally was $16 for 5 tacos! Lol.. Well we tried it and we now know that we are sticking to our Lindo Michoacan in Henderson or Taco Y Taco in Henderson.. Hell, I might just move to Henderson if it means getting a decent Mexican dish in this city... Sorry Piches Tacos. You guys are Pinche expensive and it Pinche wasn't worth it.",

We asked about nachos because we didn't see any on the menu and the waitress said that they did have some on the gringo menu. Huh?

I was able to try the al pastor and el gringo tacos.  The el gringo is a specialty taco created by one of the Anaya brothers, Javier.  The flavor profile on el gingo is like no other.  Simply put, AMAZING!!!  So good in fact I brought my whole family back at 5 when they opened up with the full menu.  We did a nice tour of the menu.  We had the cheese quesadilla, asada quesadilla, asada fries, pollo mole taco, adobada taco, another gringo taco, the potato and manchego cheese flautas (AMAZING), and one of my wife's favorites the street corn on the cob.  To top it all off I came back again this morning to try their chilaquiles for breakfast.  It's about time we have a great authentic Mexican restaurant up here in the southwest part of Las Vegas.  They're located at the Gramercy on Russell between Fort Apache and the 215.  Come check it out and treat your palate!!",

I ordered a blood orange margarita and it was awesome. I order the queso and chorizo dip, it was salty didn't care for it so just had the pico de gallo and chips. We got out taco order and the order was all wrong I ordered a fish taco carnitas and carne and didn't get the right order and my friend got the wrong order also. The waitress was dingy and forgot our water and salsa .. The only good part of this dining experience was the margaritas.",

First off the waitress was not friendly at all and took very long to take out order and get our drinks! The food last night tasted like it was sitting around for awhile! Usually this place has the freshest tacos but this time the tortillas were hard and tasted stale! The rice and beans also had no flavor! It tasted like nothing! Also our waiter Manuel, took forever with our cards! When he collected our bill he had our card for 20  minutes. When we spotted him coming back finally he first went to the other table to take their order (meanwhile he still had our cards)! He then placed our cards on the bar!!! And left them there and took the other tables order! I can not believe he left both my card and my friends card on the bar without anyone! If we were not their they could of easily got them stolen!! This is unacceptable and I can not bieleve he did this! I got up and went to the bar and grabbed our cards because I will not have my card unattended especially on a bar! This is horrible customer service! When he saw me get my card, all he said was \"oh sorry\". Wow pinche tacos this needs to be addressed! Very disappointed!",

My husband and I spent a good portion of lunch trying to figure out every single ingredient they used for it.    Our son requested a quesadilla and French fries, which he pretty much devoured. That in itself is a win, because he hardly comes close to finishing his food while we're out.  The atmosphere is super chill. When we walked in \"you know how we do it\" by Ice cube was playing. I knew in that moment I was gonna love this place. The staff is kick back, which works for us. We don't like when waiters are in your face every 5 minutes. If we didn't live so far, we'd definitely be regulars here.",

    "text": "We ate dinner here for the first time. The decor is cute and the staff was helpful. We tried the taco combination plate. I ordered one fish, one chicken mole and one adobada pork, which all comes with rice and beans and some chips. Tortillas were mushy and though the fish had a zing to season it, the adobada was dry and unremarkable. Mole looked like mole and had a remote flavor of mole to help us identify it. My husband had the same but with one of the shrimp instead of fish. A Mexican coke at $3.50 and a bottle of beer for 6.00, a very pedestrian flan with a pretty ok base but a slathering of not good caramel syrup, and we spent over $40.  Now, I seriously would pay more than this if the memory of delicate flavors, creative combinations and thoughtful presentations followed me around after a meal....  Not sure why a place so well known and appreciated in CA would open and serve very average and unmemorable food is a mystery.  No one mentioned Happy Hour, though it was in the time frame, and we noted a small blackboard describing Happy Hour in very small writing on a low to the ground chalkboard as we were nearly finished.  Three stars are for the staff.  When we have so many Wow-worthy off-strip places it is of interest that people don't taste what they are serving. The earth did not move.",

    "text": "I have gone to two of Pinches Tacos' locations.... downtown and this location on Russell. The last few times I have gone to Pinches Tacos I went to this location since it is much closer to me.   When you walk in, it is always a live atmosphere. Lively music and the decor is really cool- Loteria meets dia de los muertos. Depending on the time you go, the place can be really packed. If you go right at dinner time, especially on a weekend, expect for there to be a wait. Anytime we come here we typically order an appetizer before we enjoy some tacos.   Best appetizers: Chorizo queso and chips (try this, you will not regret it) and the Flautas (both beef and chicken are delicious). Both portions are perfect for sharing.   Tacos, we typically do the taco plate. The tacos I would recommend are: Asada, fish, al pastor and carnitas. The plate comes with a side of beans and rice. If you are more into a crispy shell taco, the gringo taco is a must!   We like coming here on Taco Tuesday or after the dinner rush. Service has always been attentive and friendly. Honestly the only reason why i am removing a star is because the last time I went in, they just couldn't get the margarita right. I did bring it to the server's attention and they tried to fix it, however it was still too sour. Aside from that hiccup, it is a great place to go for some tacos or flautas.",

The margaritas they offered were traditional, peach, and blood orange (they don't have them on the menu). They were tasty and didn't skimp on the alcohol since they were happy hour prices. The flautas were delicious! It's the perfect appetizer to go with your first margarita. The tacos were good. I ordered the combo plate with fish, asada, and shrimp. I would've liked some different salsas or a salsa bar to customize our tacos. The Mexican corn is delicious and off the cob is even easier to eat and enjoy if you don't want to get your hands dirty. I'll definitely be back for their happy hour.",

    "text": "My first visit to Pinches was on Cinco de Mayo. It was good, but not great like I was expecting based on their reputation around town and as a result would rate my experience at 3.5-4 stars.  First of all, the location isn't the easiest to find. It is part of an urban living shopping center that doesn't have the best parking flow or signage. After driving around the lot for a couple minutes, we found Pinches Tacos' business sign and parked nearby. Walking up to the restaurant is a little nondescript and the front door isn't distinguished as the main entrance. It doesn't have their name on it, the word entrance, or any signage above it; just a sugar skull decal. So we kept walking and ended up awkwardly entering from the patio.   We were promptly greeted and seated at the bar where the bar staff shared the Cinco specials and quickly served us. I tried their blood orange margarita and Taylor had a beer. The Marg was good, not great, they didn't skimp on the booze but I didn't really feel like it had any blood orange flavor.. or really any special flavors beyond the classic Marg.   Food was also very good, but still fell a bit short of great in my opinion. I tried two of their tacos- al Pastor and Carnitas, and Taylor ordered chicken enchiladas with rice and beans. The best part of the meal is their homemade tortillas! It is a rare detail to find and makes all the difference in the world. The rice and beans were pretty bland for my taste, but the enchilada sauce was flavorful and an interesting take on the classic red sauce; not quite as spiced as I'm used to but had a rich and luscious texture to bathe every bite of the enchiladas. Again, my tacos were good, not great. I was surprised I preferred the flavors of the Carnitas more than the al Pastor, but I was also pretty disappointed when there was a huge chunk of fat/connective tissue on my small street taco:( When I mentioned it to the server, she didn't really care and just said \"usually they are pretty good about that stuff\".   The atmosphere is really vibrant and unique. It has a laidback vibe of a taqueria but with full service. The bar opens up to a small patio and features an outdoor bar counter for service. There is also a large area for viewing the kitchen and a fun taco truck installation as a service station.   Overall, I was pleased with the quick service with a relaxed atmosphere and the food and drinks are satisfactory enough to ensure I'll return, but not with any urgency.",

Despite it being \"taco Tuesday\", and not ordering the tacos that don't qualify for Tuesday discount my tab was $19! Twenty dollars for a beer and four tacos is steep. Sat down, no napkins...no available hot sauce. As I drink my warm beer, waiting for my tacos I finally asked for a cold glass, but it was warm too. Perhaps I ran in on a day where things just happened, but the high prices don't match the quality and experience. Anyway, A friend recommended it...unsure if I will try again.",

Theres not much meat in them only a little bit if im paying almost $15 for a plate of carne asada fries i expect to have more than 7 pieces of meat in there.  the service was okay..the girls seemed bored and not at the counter but sitting on a table where people eat. I asked one of the girls for hot sauce or salsa, and she said there was pico de gallo on the fries already?! ummmmm THATS not a hot salsa?!..after 15 seconds she was like \"OH OK! you want a salsa?\" like i don't know what was hard to understand about what i asked for. the salsa was good and spicy tho so i did like it. all in all i'll probably come back and try something else, thats if i dont find a better place.",

The Cook Area has graffiti on the outside and the paint is mainly pink. I happen to be there on a Tuesday. Which other than the asada or Seafood tacos were $2 each.. I got the pastor, abodaba, cactus and Gringo tacos with a lime jarrito. Service was good and friendly. The food was good too. I didn't get up and do a cartwheel or even break out into a dance of any sort. but it's a cool place with good food. I can see going there on a Saturday afternoon hanging out having tacos and drinks. I think they're above average and definitely deserve 4 stars. Have to say good job Pinches Tacos. If I am back on this side of town it would be a place I would revisit.",

A server came by to get us our drinks pretty quick and after that he just disappeared and I had to wave him down every time I needed something. He acted disinterested and never checked on us. Beers were $6-$7.   On Tuesday pork and chicken tacos are $2 so I ordered one Al Pastor, one Carnitas and 3 Chicken. As soon as I bit into the carnitas it was gross and I put it down. The Al Pastor was bearable, kind of. Same with the chicken. I ended up eating my Al Pastor taco and one chicken taco and asking for the check. Nobody asked us how our food was which most restaurants do right after your first bite.   Not going back. Terrible service and tacos.",

    "text": "So, I'm sure other people have had and do have good food here. But that wasn't the case for me today. I have nothing against Pinche's other than their terrible food. It was some of the worst tacos I've ever had and being a former chef on the strip, making good tacos doesn't take much more than fresh product, solid cooking techniques and balance with acid(lime in this case) and salt. I'll just lay out the facts and let you decide for yourselves:  - Guacamole was salt less and lime less along with being too spicy.  - The salsa that came with the chips, that I presume was their \"house salsa\" tasted like it had black pepper in it and was also salt less.  - The Elote was also just ok. The mayo was squirted on rather than brushed on so there were globs of mayo on the plate which is unappetizing. Again, a little lime would go a long way.  - The adobada taco was absolutely terrible. This is where cooking technique comes in. The pork was so tough and the fat not rendered which made it unable to even chew. Along with the whole taco being dry as their was nothing on it but the meat, onions and cilantro.  - The pastor taco was the only highlight. And I say that barely. The flavor was good and the meat was tender. It was still dry though as most places add a crema and pineapple to it to add creaminess, sweet, and sour contrast. Again, only meat, onions and cilantro.  - The fish taco was horrendous. The fish was obviously not fried to order as it was soggy with no crust. The cole slaw on it was blah. Nothing great.  - The gringo taco was ordered my wife and she liked it. I didn't try it but it isn't hard to make the \"traditional\" American hard shell taco.   In the end, I will not being going back. When it comes to cooking, mistakes are made sometimes but for Pinche's, everything was a mistake as the lone bright spot was the gringo taco. If that's the only thing that is good that comes from your kitchen, then things need to change. It was their sign outside that made me laugh when leaving, \"Real Mexican Food by Real Mexicans.\"  Obviously not the case with Pinche's.",

What gives? (2)service is friendly but the kitchen is slow(3) value: for the subpar tacos (with no salsa!) 2.5 star review.   I have to say,  the decor is pretty awesome. Tucked in the Gramercy complex, the restaurant sports a pseudo food truck with brightly colored painted walls. That being said,  the ambience doesn't make up for the food. (FYI - no diaper changing station in the bathroom).  The hubby really wanted to try their fare on taco Tuesday. Just FYI -  their $2 tacos only apply to their vegetarian, chicken and pork options which are regularly priced at $2.95 or less.   We tried 5 tacos - the al pastor, adobada, carnitas, chicken mole and the pollo a la parrilla.   Of the five tacos,  the only one that tasted like much was the chicken mole. For a chicken mole, it would only be okay in my books -  lacking any smokey complexity. As for the rest -  the fillings were  terribly bland and I couldn't really tell which taco was which (they all tasted the same... Bland!). There was literally no heat in the food and the tacos were served bereft of any salsa. (yes... The fillings were topped with some crushed tomatoes which is not salsa. FYI- no salsa bar... What self respecting taco joint has no salsa bar?). The meat depending on the taco was occasionally a bit tough. It was a pity because the corn tortillas were freshly made and pretty tasty.   The front of the house service is good friendly and prompt. However for a taco joint, the kitchen was rather slow at bringing out the orders.  Overall, not an experience that I feel a need to repeat. With some great hole in the wall joints serving amazing tacos in town, I give this one a pass.",

First of all how cool it the name the style of this place? The cool vibrant edgy and kick back feel is exudes through their decor. The owners must want people to feel excited and comfortable yet get great food at the same time.   With a fake taco truck right in the middle of Resturant and Pinches everything this taco place easily won my heart over quick.   But the tacos really do steal the show. With home made tacos fresh in front of your eyes and mouth watering meats who can go wrong. The special \"Gringo\" taco was actually really really good. A hard shell fried taco with tender flavorful steak inside and a spicy creamy sauce it was sooooo good. The lingua was also amazing and as tender as can be. The tortilla though in picture I thought it was going to be this thick doughy tortilla oh but was I wrong thin and warm with a great corn taste you can tell the difference why it's better then store bought and pre made.   Burrito was good and I was glad they had that option but I will stick to the tacos cause they were amazing. They offer a HH with $2 tacos and $4 beers all night on certain night. Owner Fernando went around talking to everyone created a very friendly and inviting atmosphere. Very cool guy! Can't wait tho come back and in the beautiful new Gramercy it was neat. There is also another location at the Container park which I will have to go check out as well!",

So, basically I had eaten one out of the 3 enchiladas and was so disappointed that I didn't even eat my rice and beans. You'd think our server would noticed and ask if everything was ok, but NO it didn't even phased her.  On top of that I had to ask for a refill to my glass.   Customer service sucked today!

The reason why I say the tacos are okay, it's Becuase the tortilla was falling apart a lot and the meat was kind of dry. It's pretty expensive for just three tacos and I paid about $11+. I don't know didn't really hit my spot in this one.",

You get the feeling that they know everyone that walks in the door. It's like a Cheers for a lot of people apparently. I'm lucky enough to work so close by! I've already been here twice in the past couple days.   Their vegan options are really good. You can either get Nopal (cactus) or Veggie (sauteed veggies), which have amazing eggplant in it, as the substance in your taco burrito. Rice and beans are delicious as well...and don't get me started on the chips: super crunchy with the perfect amount of salt.   I would suggest coming here and starting out with a combo plate of a couple different types of tacos to get a taste. Don't forget to check out the specials board!  The atmosphere is awesome. The walls are covered with graffiti, Loteria stuff, and Dio de los muertos stuff. We opted for the \"car seat\" chair in the bar area. They are so comfortable; you won't want to leave. I haven't had the pleasure of dining at the bar yet, but that's next on the list. This place would be great for a party or happy hour location.",

First impression looked like a food truck inside of a building. Pretty neat idea. The flautas were AMAZING. Overall atmosphere is chill. The servers were attentive and friendly. The only thing that bothered me was the cracks between the tables were filled with some kind of silicone. It looked pretty dirty so even if they cleaned the table you could still see the leftover crumbs or dirt on the table.",

Right off the bat, the \"waitresses\" began complaining about other employees loudly directly behind me.  They were all wearing random really casual clothes that just made the place look even more out of place for the nice location. Flat soda (he said he had to get it from the bar), stale chips (Really?  How do you mess up chips?) and a burrito that was just mush.  It was supposed to be steak, but I could only find tiny bits of meat!  To top it off, the avocado inside was way off!  I know what over ripe avocado tastes like.  This place seems like it is on the verge of going under.  Trust me, I'm a Mexican-American who has eaten some of the best Mexican fare in this amazing town- AVOID THIS PLACE.",

We had the carne asada burrito, which was so full of refried beans I had forgotten it was supposed to be steak, the few pieces of steak that were in there tasted so overwhelmingly of onion i was glad that there wasn't more. Don't get me wrong, I love onions, and cook and eat them all the time, however the meat tasted like it was marinated in grated white onion and nothing else, though the meat was tender. The salsa that was served on the side was completely flavorless, though it did look to be freshly made. We also had a 3 taco combo which came with rice and beans (both bland) the chicken mole taco was good, but not great. The citrus carnitas were totally flavorless, and the adobada pork was surprisingly also tasteless as well. The tortillas however appeared to be freshly made, and were really good. We also had chicken flautas, which were probably the best thing we ate, although once again, the chicken lacked flavor. We also tried a veggie taco. The vegetables weren't caramelized, and... Big surprise here.... Lacked any sort of flavor.  I will say that all of the ingredients seemed fresh, and of decent quality. Everything needed salt, and desperately lacked flavor, heat, or taste of any kind. They joke that this is Mexican food for gringos, they aren't kidding.  For the price ( around $50, for counter service, this to me is expensive.) We won't be back.",

I asked the cashier if the burrito was spicy at all and she said no. The owner was in that day i went, i wish i would of told him about the burrito, but i wanted to get outta this place. My wife had the chicken torta, and you guessed it, not enough chicken.  I think they pre cook all their meat, and have it sitting for a while  This place is very expensive , you would be better off going to la bonita market, and i hate to say it, but robertos tack shop. They have a marketing strategy that says cooked by mexicans. Im thinking those mexicans they refer to must of grown up rich or had some type of culinary training (and not in the good way) in America, not mexico, because this food doesn't taste authentic to me. Granted, its better than tex mex which is utterly disgusting.   Stay away from this place. Usually i try a place twice before i give up on it, but once was all this place needed.",

Trying to catch late dinner with the kids. We waited until 8:05 and had to leave without getting any service. There were a few tables there and the one that had the attention was the one with one of the owners of this place, drinking with friends. I'm sorry but YOUR customers come first. There were 3 servers and about 5 tables. No urgency to try and get our drink order, let alone get our food order. 1 girl walked by us no joke about 10-15 times and didn't even look over at us. The other girl, went back and forth from the kitchen and the other server kept going to the table where one of the owners was sitting. We love the food and but the service was terrible, if you call it service because we didn't get any food or drinks. The frustrating part was that we had our kids and were starving after a long day of activities and school. We will not be going back to this place and will definitely not refer our friends and family about pinches tacos anymore.",

The tacos come preseasoned with a sweetish salsa taste. I'm not into sweet salsa. There was no salsa bar either. We were told the tortillas are freshly made so I ordered a few. When the tortillas came, I was disappointed because they tasted like the tortillas sold at the supermarket, and not hand made gorditas. I'm not going back.

Carnitas are supposed to be succulent crispy on outside and tender and juicy on the inside...and some fatty on it...the fish taco....ok...where is the white cream sauce...every fish taco place has some sort if tangy sauce inside taco....above all....with all those tacos....you forgot the limes...smh.  Beans dry rice ok...man Real Mexican food made by real Mexicans???? Well...I can see the customer base around you and they don't know any better...and I see you have multiple locations and maybe you can say he doesn't know what's to have a Mexican restaurant...wrong 5 in total I come from a Mexican chain back in L.A.  I live here and out that business....I had high expectations from you guys...if you want take a trip to taco El Gordo or Taco Y Taco they know real down homie tacos...here in Las Vegas... Just being honest....the hand made tortillas were good....",

When we walked in, I was pleased how clean and friendly the staff was. The ambiance of the place was great also! Now the food was AMAZING! I got the tacos. It tasted really fresh, and the meat was cooked to perfection! Very flavorful!!! I was even pleased with the salsa! I hate going to places and asking for their spiciest and when I get it, it's not. Except for here, it was really spicy! I LOVED it! My boyfriend got the carne asada fries and he said they were BOMB! He said the avacado was reeeealllly good! Totally worth the price! Now I don't always eat Mexican food, but when I do, I choose PINCHES TACOS! Choose wisely my friends! Lol! :)",

After entering Pinches i was greeted immediately by the gentleman behind the counter who informed me to take a menu and order with him at the counter when ready. The ordering station is shapes like a food truck! Very creative! The tables surrounding me look very colorful and appear to have a rustic antique look. This place has a very homie feeling. I selected the chicken enchilada combo plate with red sauce. The sauce was a bit sweet tasting and very delicious. I even elected for a glass of wine which perfectly complimented my meal. It's so hard to find good Mexican food these days and at a decent price. I must admit I cleaned my plate completely, it was that good! I can't wait to go back!",

This place claims authentic mexican food and they have a sign that says they want to keep you away from \"fakexican food\" and well this food is really not good Mexican food. Their enchiladas where in the worse sauce I've ever tried, it taste like cheap ketchup or something. The tortilla wrap was just bad...didnt even taste like a tortilla so i dont believe they are handmade. The rice taste burnt the beans are canned. Obviously or something. Jeez...and the corn on the cob sure its cool..but i have to put my own chili powder at home since theirs is just not good. Or at least not traditional.  Overall it's pretty sad that they just claim so much and all I see is low quality food.",

I consider this place a 'quick service' restaurant minus the quick. I walked in very confused; wasn't sure if I went up to the 'food truck' to place my order or sat down and had a server come to us. The gentlemen, not 100% sure of his role told us to choose any seat and a server would come to us. This guy was the one we placed our drink order with; micheleda and a Bloody Mary. I felt like the process was very delayed in getting drinks but then again there was only one bartender for a Saturday night. Aside from that, the drinks were perfectly made! Our actual server came by and took our order. We placed chips and salsa as our appetizer because let's be real, if a Mexican place failed at a good guacamole and salsa dish then we would be in for a not so good Mexican experience. This place passed! It reminded me of my best friends mother True authentic cooking. Our order was in and was eyeing everything that came by. Mind you, there were only 3 tables at this time. We devoured our entrees and continued to sit at our table with no drinks; water or adult beverage. yet, the server just leaned up against the truck with her colleague and chatted while making direct contact with us and never approaching us with 'is there anything else' we can get for you.  As a service critic, when a server drops off a dish that you ordered and sees an empty one, they should take it. Well, dishes piled up quick!  This place does lack service and has a very very laid back vibe so if you're there with no time constraint, it's definitely worth it.  Again, great energy, pricing is affordable and great food. I just wish their service was more focused on the little things.",

They need to step up their kitchen act, place looks like great potential.  Oh, and both drinks I ordered from the menu were not available....but that can happen sometimes.  On top of all the above pleasures, they add open food items $0.50 on the bill which is no where on the menu, when asked the lady claim that this is extra costs for the lengua....LMAO !!!!",

Each taco had 1 small tortilla that broke down as you lifted to gobble your 2 bite size taco.  If I did a sit-in for this place I can see why they can charge up the price for a small taco but you walk-in, order your food and go find a seat. Nothing more as far as customer service.  I guess someone has to pay for the location of this place, their customers.  If the price was right & taste was on point, I'd return but I'm not a believer in overpriced tacos where I have to order myself & no other customer service.",

We were greeted immediately when we walked in and everyone was very pleasant. We were struck by the atmosphere right away. Giant taco truck in the middle of the restaurant surrounded by tables and chairs. There is a viewing area where you can watch food being prepared. The music was not annoying. It wasn't to loud and was Some Classic Enrique.   The food itself. Amazing. We had the Mexican Street corn (in a cup) and it was better than I had expected. Very excellent.  We had chips with fresh Guacamole and Pico. Also very good.  The lunch was three carne asada tacos and 1 chicken mile taco. Everyone was excellent. I craved more but had to stop myself. Fat boy tendency in full effect.   Very clean dining room. And overall excellent place. Next time we will try the bar!    Def will be back.",

I came here this past weekend anticipating happy hour however the nail salon across the way took longer than expected. No biggie! Hungry as I was I still wanted some tacos! After drooling over all the pictures on Yelp my cousin and I finally arrived. The open kitchen conept is pretty dope because you can actually look inside and see them prepare your food. Everything made FRESH from SCRATCH! Thank you taco God's! The bar has this cool indoor outdoor set up and that's what seemed most appropriate for this occasion thanks to the beautiful weather. When you choose to sit in the patio your bartender is also your server. I wish I could remember her name but the amount of margaritas I had kind of umm clogged my memory ha! BUT what I will say is that she was awesome and made some strong recommendations for us being that we were newbies. Happy hour was over but we still rolled with the tacos and margaritas! Oh let me tell you though, these weren't your typical wimpy pre-mix tasting cheap tasting margaritas by far. The pour wasn't stingy at ALL and they tasted great! The street tacos were a good size and I was blown away with the bursting flavors. All in all this place rocks! I WILL be back to make it for happy hour!",

However, this is an acceptable substitution.  I like the decor-taco truck inside! My kids love it. I ordered Carne Asada Fries with beef which were excellent even the next day heated up. My son got chicken and beef on his. My daughter got the kid's meal quesadilla with rice and beans.   My only complaint is that there really is no service beyond someone bringing your order to your table. No salt and pepper shakers-only packets and plastic eating utensils. When I'm spending $50-$100, I really want a dining experience not a pseudo taco truck experience. I get the concept but I don't care for it.   Bathrooms are cool. Tiles feature day of the dead characters. I hope I posted some. Kitschy.     We will definitely be back.",

We were greeted promptly by a waitress who was just passing by and told us to sit where ever we like. We sat in the bar area at a table, it took a few minutes for us to be notice but the service was really great. We came during happy hour which is from 4-7 pm all tacos are al a carte but only $2 each (there are a few exceptions though).  The food:  We ordered 1 taco al pastor - really good but a little too marinated for my taste.  1 shrimp taco - amazing!  1 fish taco - amazing! 1 pollo a la parilla - so moist and well cooked/marinated 1 taco de lengua - the meat itself lacked some flavor and the green salsa on it was too spicy for me but overall this one gets a 3 on its own. 1 gringo taco - comes in a fried hard shell tortilla, my bf really liked this one.   The ambiance is loud and fun as a bar should be. But if you want to privacy and seclusion they have the opposite side of the bar where the dining area is which I think is good for that.",

And perfect food to fit the hot summer!  I tried Pinches in the container park and didn't know they had a new location until I saw it in the Weekly. They talked highly about it so after the pool it sounded like a good choice.   It was exciting to walk in and see all of the decoration. There was a big stop light that I didn't get to take a picture of because my phone was on 1%.   The taquitos were our appetizer. So good! I can't believe it had potatoes inside. I got the combination plate- cactus, vegetarian and shrimp. While my girlfriend had the fish, chicken and shrimp. I tried everything and it was good! I think the fish was the best!   I saw a corn and we couldn't resist to order one and share. The Mexican-style corn is her favorite thing! She ate most of it. I thought it was too cheesy. She said it was the most authentic. I said well it's made by real Mexicans, what do you expect.",

The lady at the counter talk to her guy friend for over 5 mins without acknowledging me while I wait in line.  I finally ordered and the food came pretty quickly(about 10 mins)... I had to get up and ask for everything I needed like lime, a refill, Tapatio, napkins....  The 2 star is for the tacos only (they were delish)",

Sad to say I'd include this one as an in between.  Service: it used to be so inviting coming here with the manager always walking by seeing how the food was but on our last visit he was just behind the register and dedicated to a big group by the bar instead. As for everyone else it's whatever, they just bring you your food and that's that. Previously you sat at your table to order now it's done fat burger style by ordering and they'll bring it to your table.  Food: I like the odd meats like tripe and my all time favorite lengua which they have here. The food is pretty good and I recommend getting the taco plate. Nothing mind blowing about the food but it is good.  Overall: this place has a weird vibe. It tries to be authentic yet seems really Americanized and gimmicky. Not as strong as when they first opened",

I took silverware and was waiting and when she brought my to go order of $50 something, she said you can give me the silverware back and use the plastic that's in the bag.

I am a firm believer that the foundation for a great taco is a great tortilla, although their tortillas seem to be made in house, they were kind of doughy - like super thick for a street \"like\" taco.  Salsas were good but they should really think about just having a salsa bar, I like to pair my tacos with specific kind of salsa depending on the meat, a green salsa on my asada tacos is a big no no, and a tomato salsa on al pastor is a no go as well.  My son order a sope and he liked it.  I ordered a side of street corn and it was ok, I think it had too much mayo.",

The decor inside is so neat complete with a indoor food truck .... yup that's right!!!!!! it is in a business park so if you think you're in the wrong place you're not just keep following your GPS and you'll find it",

    "text": "First off, I'm Mexican so I'm very picky with places that claim to be Authentic. I was so excited about trying this place because I saw they had Mole Tacos. I looked at other yelpers pictures and the decor seemed super cute. I love the indoor taco truck decor. I called and placed a carryout order. I ordered two Mole Tacos, an order of Flautas (Fried Chicken rolled tacos) and two Mexican drinks.  Pinches Tacos is hard to find. I did find it, parked, walked inside and got confused when I walked in. I didn't know if you had to place an order in a line or if you have to sit and people wait on you because there was no one there to greet me. I approached where the waiters input orders. I looked like a lost puppy. Employees kept passing me. I tried to get their attention, it was loud in there and I did tell someone that I was there to pick up an order and she ignored me. A waitress finally walked and asked me if she could help me, so 1 out of 3 will serve you. I paid for my order and left.   Food Review: Not impressed. I really wanted to like this place. I'm really looking for a Mexican Place that I can frequent when I'm feeling lazy and don't want to cook. The Mole was bland. Very tasteless. The chicken was dry. The star of this restaurant is their tortillas. I then tried their \"flautas\". I don't know what I had but they were not flautas. They were sweet. Such a weird taste. I'm guessing they fried flour tortillas?And, again their chicken was dry. I don't know how since the tortillas were soggy because of all the stuff they put on top. The amount of chicken they add to the inside of the \"flautas\" was excessive. This is definitely not Authentic. Oh! I also ordered a side of Mexican Rice. You can tell that rice has been reheated over and over.  This restaurant has a Gringo Menu. I would hate to try anything from that part of the menu seeing as what I had was already very \"Gringo\". Nothing was spicy and I don't mean just spicy but that kind of flavor spice that makes good Mexican food. Everything was so tasteless. The salsa had no flavor. I was here on a weekend so I think the food should have been fresh but I didn't see that in my meal.",

The skull paintings on the walls with an actual stoplight is just so unique for a Vegas Mexican restaurant.   Food is on point! I got the fish taco and it was really good. Kinda pricey, but I was full with one. My husband got the shrimp taco plate and the kids got the bean burrito kids meal. We all loved our food. Dessert we got churros without the horchata ice cream so it was an ordinary churro.   At night, the bar side was happening with a pretty good happy hour. So just be aware if you bring your kids here.   Overall, I give it 5 stars. Food . Price . Ambiance .",

I sat for about 20min, at  the bar, before being acknowledged. After another 10min I finally had some water in front of me and was able to place a food order while the guest sitting in the booth behind me (that were there long before me) waited to be served. As I write this now at the end of my experience they still don't have water in front of them. Food came to me in a decent timeframe although it wasn't what I ordered. When my order arrived, I have to say, it wasn't bad! Nothing special, but not bad.   The staff argued with each other in front of guests, constantly on their phones, not cleaning the dirty dining room, it was really rather embarrassing.  Where it got at its worst and prompted me to write this review was when I witnessed the bartender eat french fries off the back bar, proceed to washing dirty glasses, then eat more fries, then make and garnish a drink. Did I mention that during that time she never once washed her hands!!!!  The rest doesn't need to be mentioned, that is more than enough for me to know that I will never be coming back here or recommending it to anyone.  I'm going to attempt to track someone down to close out my bill now since the same bartender left the bar unattended for a cig brake.",

Bummer, because it's a great atmosphere and has a bar and tacos, would be a good fun casual place to visit more often  it cost a little less.  The food was pretty good. Our experience had slow service,  I showed up 30 minutes before happy hour ended and had hoped to squeeze in 2 drinks but we just didn't get service in time.  Anyway overall it was good I would still come back from time to time. I wouldn't call it the best mexican food around, but not bad at all.",

They really spent some time to emphasis the theming and branding. This is something that will always draw my attention and earn my respect!  We got two of the taco combos with 5 different kinds of meat - carne asada, beef tongue, fish, shrimp, and roasted chicken. It's really so hard for me to pick a favorite because they're all really delicious in its own way! But if I really have to pick.. I'll say carne asada and the shrimp.   The chips that come with the combo is also good and made fresh, little too salty though. And my True favorite thing here that will definitely make me come back is the CORN! Sooooo delicious! Juicy, flavorful, huge, and so sweeet! Must try!",

So we got to sit and it took a bit to get service, but not a big deal. Server comes up and we order peach and blood orange margaritas and start to order. We ask for the flautas and were told their fryer was down, basically half the menu wasn't available. At this point we had already committed, it had been twenty minutes and had our beverages already. I wish they would have said something when we sat down, but they didn't, so that was a big impact on how I rated. We ordered some tacos, I'll say their handmade tortillas are awesome , perfect texture, but the pastor lacked flavor. Their beef cheek was good, and the roasted chick had good flavor but was a bit on the dry side. We've had good experiences with pinches in LA, but this place left us wanting. Maybe they had an off day , so we will give it another go .",

Then you face the kitchen where you can see the cooks preparing your food.  On the left side you have a bar that offers inside and outside seatings. And outside the terrace is just humongous !  Now the food. I ordered the simple veggie burrito that is made with beans, Mexican rice, guacamole, onions and cilantro. I added cheese.  I can understand when people say it's missing a little flavor but me I like it this way. For me it's always easier to add any kind of salsa or hot sauce than having no choice and have to eat a burning plate that turns your mouth on fire and prevent you to be aware of what you're eating.   Knowing that it's just across the street from my house I'll be back for sure !",

Was given the menu. There was an adjustment I needed made to one of the tacos and was given my request.   Opted for watermelon agua fresca and the combination plate consisting of carne Asada, al pastor, and adobada tacos. Nothing ordered disappointed in the slightest. However that watermelon agua fresca was the True highlight. I need to go back for another one. Like drinking a liquid watermelon.   Interior is several tables, music playing in the background. Everything was clean.   Would recommend- pricing was reasonable  Location is 215/ Russell- ample parking",

    "text": "When you think tacos the word 'Pinche' doesn't really come to mind lol. As a matter of fact being a construction worker I've heard many colorful words come after the word 'Pinche' but tacos was never one of them. So when I heard there was a restaurant called Pinche's Tacos I had to check it out.   Upon entering I notice something that just made me stop and laugh. The Pinche Gringo menu. That's right, Pinche Gringo! It was posted on the side of what looked like a food truck in the middle of the restaurant. Immediately I dug the vibe. From the gigantic 4 foot tall Connect Four game in the bar to the walls covered in burner style graffiti this place was just cool.   I have my very own food groups as I've said in other reviews tacos are one of them. I mean without tacos life would just be so bland and boring right?  Now when you think Mexican food you almost automatically think tacos and when you walk into an establishment with the word 'Tacos' clearly in their name, what do you order? That's right, a burrito! At least I do lol.  I'm a sucker for good carnitas and though there are a lot of Mexican restaurants in Vegas, not all do it right. Some actually do it very badly. It's safe to say that my first judgement of a Mexican restaurant is based on their carnitas. I know I know there's other very well known dishes that are equally amazing but this is my review so, neener neener...  Needless to say they didn't do it right. They did it amazing. It literally was a flavor combination in carnitas I wasn't prepared for. Most Mexican restaurants I've been to all have a kind of shared flare. It's probably one of the reasons I love it so much. Like a comfort food, you just know and love the flavors. I didn't get that in this burrito. It was a whole new experience and I loved it. It had just the right amount of kick in each bite. Alex ordered the Al Pastor burrito and in a bright flash of light it was consumed. I don't even remember him chewing. About the only complaint I have with Pinche's Tacos is the rice. It was pretty dry, but as Alex said, \"Mix it with the beans and all is well.\" He was right but I still would have liked it to have a little moisture to it's texture. Other than that It was a great experience and some very tasty food.

    "text": "Overall pretty disappointed all around. We came here a month and a half ago and it was an exact replay.  From the get go service was far from superb.  From us having to wave one of the servers down for a way to get us to order to let us know we have to order up front ... which wasn't instructed to us by our server when being sat at our table. There was maybe 2 other tables when we were there. Coming from a bartenders & serving background, when I see a table that's been sat without instructions to order at the front and no one else to order. I'd casually check in and ask if everyone's okay. Aside from that my personal bill was 23$ (I never complain about price) However the presentation of the dishes I ordered were pretty disappointing as well as portions. The dip plate was the main disappointment. Salsa looked as if the scoop was taken from the bottom due to the juices being half full and the guacamole was had a small about with a little less than half being a chunk of avocado and not even a side, the dead middle with the bottoms still having the top part of the bud (broke my heart).  The trips were hard and above normal on the salt.  Rice was cold and just didn't taste like fresh rice and the beans were a tad bit warm but room temperature. The 2 stars comes from their tacos. Absolutely delicious! The Carne Asada tacos tasted amazing and the portions were of a normal taco. Added a little hot sauce on it to give it's a kick because I loveee spices and some lime and it was AMAZING! The deep fried beef was okay , the spices tasted good and it was a good amount of beef! Both times coming here the tacos have been spot on! Unfortunately people will lose my business when staff is unenthusiastic and doesn't pay attention to the small things. The small things like explaining to customers how a restaurant works when seating guests in an area where the register is not seen and a bare minimum presentation with food(excluding the tacos!) that taste that doesn't deserve 2 stars. I never write reviews but when a place disappoints twice in a row , it's usually a consistent area where an aspect of the restaurant lacks.",

We split a chicken quesadilla and each ordered one taco. The guy let me try the \"cactus\" taco. Wasn't a big fan of thr favor plus I like my tacos to have meat/protein on it lol. Anyway cool little inside food truck type place with Mexican skull artwork and chain fence and car seat type booths and a bar. I would go again, friendly fast service and clean establishment with a cool vibe. Good marinade on the chicken and I got a fries shredded need taco-goos flavor! Just gota work on finding more parking and its a winner!",

The waitress didn't know her business nor did she care for ours because we only have seen her twice once for our order and again to give us our food, the tacos are half price on Tuesday except seafood and lengua those are regular price. The margaritas are a still $5 on happy hour with only one shot, but the mole taco is fire and so is the al pastor, I would have to come back again and hope for better service because the food is delish but the service lacks.",

The interior was very colorful and spacious, and there was even a taco truck inside as decoration! Service was friendly and good overall, though there was a brief period that we were not checked on (i.e. no water refills) while the two female employees out front were eating.  Prices are a little higher ($3-4 per taco) but they have other foods too. The food was pretty good, but not mind-blowing. I liked how crunchy the sope was but expected some cheese. The torta also had too much mayonnaise for my tastes. The jamaica was not sour enough for me, and the side of nopales was chilled (I prefer warm or at least room temperature nopales).   They do have salsas and lime, but you have to ask for them.  Overall, not bad and a welcome option for this part of town, but I wish they had more taco options, including things I love like tripa (tripe).",

I went during happy hour and sat at a small side table beside the bar because I'm a loner. Bianca who was also working as a bartender took care of my order and I went completely off her recommendations. A Blood orange margarita paired with a el pastor and carnita taco was her suggestion and it was amazing. I'm in the service industry and I understand a one top isn't the most appealing table to wait on especially having to walk around the bar to get to me but Bianca's service was greatly appreciated and they have a repeat customer because of that. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED",

Not only is the food really good, but the customer service and the atmosphere are great too! The entire restaurant is decorated like a food truck location, where the food truck is the kitchen! I have never had a bad experience with any of the employees.  I would highly recommend trying them out if you have a craving for Mexican food!",

The decor inside is really cute, they have a food truck inside and their kitchen has big windows so you can see the tacos being made. So sweet! Also there is a bar inside, as well as a patio and bar service outside. They have tables available in the bar area, some of the tables have big comfy car seats as seating. On Tuesdays they have $2 tacos! (on select tacos). The flavors of their veggie tacos are delicious. In order to make it vegan, I order no cheese, no slaw, add lettuce and their beans do not have lard in them. I checked with a few different servers the first time I went in. They also have a blood orange margarita that is delicious!   Pros: cute decor, vegan options, fast service, friendly staff, taco tuesday specials   Cons: - - -   Tips: they had multiple TVs where they show the games, so it can get busy but there's a patio outside where you can get service at the bar",

This location however cute it is was soo disappointing. My husband is an Executive Chef on the strip and we always test new places with an open mind. To be able to deliver a Togo order proper is a testament to devotion to customers. Pinches failed miserably with the food,the server who helped us was to say the least  condescending and put out to help us. It was 11 am and we were the only people in the restaurant. We ordered 1 carne asada burrito,cheese enchiladas and a bean and cheese burrito...( the bean and cheese burrito was not on the menu) . Enchiladas were cold and the sauce tasted like Ragu. The rice was cold and hard...clearly yesterday's. The bean and cheese had barely any cheese and no sauce at all. It was like eating canned beans. The asada was ok...just kinda meh...And the bill with tip( yes we always tip 20%on Togo)$52.....we were charged $8.50 for a bean burrito. If I ordered a side of beans with a tortilla it would cost less than half. We got no silver no napkins and 2 portion cups of salsa(it was good,but come on 2 small portion cups for $52 of Mexican food).So I'm sad to say we won't be returning.....and we live in Summerlin. We were so excited to have authentic Mexican in our neighborhood. Sticking with Viva Mercado....food is great and most important they want us to return so they don't have to charge $8.50 for some beans!",

I had an horchata which was very small for the price (Roberto's taco shop horchata is huge and well worth it). What really concerned us was the rating from the Nevada Health Department. Didn't notice it until we were eating. They had a \"B\" rating and I can tell you from working in food & beverage, that is NOT good. We found out why...we saw a woman wearing regular clothes (manager ??) enter the kitchen and begin to work with the food with no gloves or hairnet. Then after a few minutes her daughter came into the kitchen to \"play\" around right next to the food!! I would think if you already have a poor \"B\" rating, that would teach you to adhere to the health laws. apparently not. I wouldn't try this place until they get their act together and comply with sanitation laws.",

I do think they either need to lower their prices or create a full service restaurant. The food quality is good, but it is set up as an order at the counter fast food type place. It's fast food with full service restaurant prices and ambience. I think if this place added a couple of servers and some good chips and salsa, it would win five stars.",

It was very watery and tasted like tomatoes thrown in a blender with no seasoning and that was it. They would be better off using canned enchilada sauce. The rice that came with the enchiladas was disgusting! You could tell it was old rice bc it was crunchy and completely inedible. I couldn't finish the enchiladas and the rice I couldn't even eat it past the first bite. The corn was they only part of my meal that was decent. The food was not only terrible but over priced too. You are better off going to Dontortaco. Don't waste your money at Pinches Tacos.",

At about 9, Young people who didn't seem to know anything about customer service. They didn't smile, they were not friendly. Not professional, long faces on the young waitress & the man who brought the food & the one handling the money. The waitress went home walked out the door & didn't say bye, nothing! No one ever came back to ask if everything was ok, if we wanted another beer, etc. They never offered us dessert. We waited for someone to come back & ask us if we were ready for our check. We waited awhile for some assistance. It never happened, we had to get up & go look for someone. The bill was wrong. It had to be fixed. That took forever. Last the food was tasteless, cold & tasted as if it was out of a can. We were so disappointed. I hyped the place up to my friends who at the restaurant couldn't stop making jokes to me how bad everything was & what was I talking about when I said it was really good. We all will never go back. The awful service was inexcusable due to the fact it was a slow night. The worst experience in eating out in Vegas.",

While waiting we saw several other customers wait and wait and then leave. The service was so bad, that I don't see myself returning. I went to anther Mexican restaurant up the street and wow the service there was awesome. I wonder how this place stays in business because I observed at least $300 dollars walk out in the 30 min I was there. If I was you I would skip this place and go to a better run restaurant where they appreciate clients and actual want to be in the restaurant business.",

I ASKED FOR SOME SALT AND PEPPER and he came out 10 minutes later with those tiny little packets of salt and pepper that you get at McDonald's. No free chips here before your meal. Taco Tuesday is a joke i ordered one beef taco and one pork taco on taco Tuesday which means tacos are advertised as two dollars each. The only taco that is two Bucks is the pork taco All the other tacos are $3.50 plus depending on which one you get The tacos are 3 inch tacos two bites and you're gone.  By the way the rice and beans suck.  The five dollar chairs that you sit on are very uncomfortable.  If they spent more than $10,000 to put his place together I'd be shocked",

However the tacos are so good that even though I missed out on a deal I'll be back.. And most likely often. The tortillas, made in house are literally some of the best I've ever had, same goes for the lengua which has been chewy every place I have ever eaten it before, but this was cooked perfectly like I made it myself, it fell apart in my mouth which is how lengua should be. My only criticism is it took longer than I expected and the Diablo sauce wasn't really, really spicy like the server warned me. In fact it's mild, good but very mild, so I had to use a lot of it.   Anyway this place is a must, if you like tacos.",

We did not ask for any modifications to them or anything to be left off. I also asked for an extra side of pico de gallo and some extra salsa. The girl working the front was obviously VERY new but for some reason was left without help, so this may have been why our order was so screwed up. However it's no excuse as new employees should be supervised until trained....  We made the mistake of not opening the box to check the order before leaving. All three came totally naked - no toppings, just plain. No slaw, no onions, no cilantro, nothing but meat (and nothing but peppers, onions and eggplant on the veggie taco). The veggie taco was also missing the shiitake mushrooms. The only other topping provided was some sad red sauce on the side. It was a mass produced fully liquid sauce that was the saddest excuse for salsa I've ever seen. Roberto's wouldn't even serve something like that. As a last straw, I got no pico at all, on the tacos or as a side, despite paying for extra.   This is exactly the \"fakexican\" the wall inside warns you about. Ironic.",

On a side note, Jefe's Tacos has the best asada fries and you get about 4 times the amount you do from Pinches for $10.    I think Pinches makes their own chips and they are delicious, the chorizzo queso was quite good, a little too creamy but still worth it. We ended up getting the taco combo plate, with asada, roasted chicken, and abado and my buddy loved his plate, another one got the asada burrito, said the burito was smaller than he expected but said it was really good. Finally our other friend got the flautas(sp) and she said they were very good. The carne asada has a very strong citrus flavor.   The also sport one of the soda machine that you can pick tons of brand name sodas then add flavored syrup.   I'd come here again for sure. Like many other reviewers have commented, the location is a bit hard to find and you may have to walk around to get to it.

Today I ordered the carne asada salad and the chicken tortilla soup. The salad was a joke, soggy shredded lettuce with no flavor, same as the chewy carne asada. The tortilla soup was very sweet and dense, tasted like a curry soup. It was terrible! This place is overpriced, overhyped, and some of the guys working there are plain rude. I'd prefer Taco Bell over this place.",

Bartender was hoping the bar area from the inside and back outside while serving us drinks and food. She was funny made this visit memorable. Never seen service with a jumping bartender. Lol...Ordered a chicken burrito it was okay but nothing to come back for. My boyfriend ordered enchiladas and taco meal. Enchilada sauce seemed more like marinara sauce for pasta.... Humm thought this was REAL mexican food...If you want to get a quick Mexican meal just go to Robertos instead of wasting your time here with over priced mexican/ italian food... Oh ya forgot to include the bathroom area men's bathroom door was wide open while i was waiting to use the ladies room crap stains all over the toilet  . Not coming back here!",

Also, my husband kept calling out to the waitress that was right at the next table chatting it up with the family. I guess you have to know someone there to get attended to. Finally, we get our food. My flautas were soggy. My husband's carne asada fries looked like everything were just thrown onto the plate. It was a mess. According to the waitress that described the tacos, she stated they were bigger than your normal street tacos. NOPE! Exact same size. My daughter did say they tasted really good, so there's that. However, paying over $3 for a street taco??? I guess it's all about location. Needless to say, $60 for a quesadilla, flautas (3 cut in halves), 2 street carne asada tacos, and carne asada fries, 2 drinks and a beer...that's too pricey for me for mexican food. And I am mexican! We definitely will not be back. Especially since we didn't feel welcomed AT ALL!",

    "text": "This is the second location for Pinches in Las Vegas and is completely different from the one in the downtown Container Park.  It's at the Gramercy just off the 215 at Russell Road.  When you enter, you place your order at a \"food truck\" window.  You're given your drink there unless you're getting soda from one of the many flavors Coke machines.  You're given a table marker and you have a seat while they make your order and then bring it to your table.  There was no one there at 5 PM on this Saturday night and I was able to take in the decor and get some photos of the interior.  It was designed nicely with whimsical wall paintings, faux garbage cans that have paper flowers in the top, and a kitchen in glass with wooden closures like a Mexican food place.  One of the owners took my order and he chatted with me about the decor and explained the Dia de los Muertos style art done of member of the Anaya family.  My meal came--a combo plate with chicken mole taco, adobada taco, and carnitas taco.  I also ordered a Mexican corn.  I asked if they'd hold off on bringing the corn until I could enjoy my tacos.  When I was done with the tacos, I was asked if I was ready for my corn and it was brought to me warm.  This was so much better than getting everything at once and having the corn cool off while eating the rest.  I also got a horchata.  The tacos were good with the chicken mole being my favorite.  I thought the other two were OK. The rice was standard and the chips and refried beans were OK, too.  The corn would have been better if it had more chili powder but I'm sure they use what the average customer would like rather than what I prefer.  Service was great and the friendliness of the staff was exceptional!  If I were rating the place solely on atmosphere, it would be 5 stars all the way.  The interior design was well planned and it's a very inviting place.  I need to come back and try some other tacos and ask for more chili on my corn.  It's easy getting here from where I live.  For those uncertain, exit the 215 at Russell Road and head west.  Halfway from the 215 to Fort Apache, there's a left turn into the Gramercy complex.  Drive a semi-circular path around the back of the building along Russell.  Just keep going past the coffee house.  Shortly after an open space, there's another building and Pinches is in the corner of that building.  You can see the 215 and the signs from the parking area.  On leaving keep going around the semi-circle and you'll be back to Russell very quickly.",

(Lol) they played Selena on the speakers - it was lovely. The micheladas are good! The food is good to me, I don't understand the negative reviews..? 2nd time I went was at night. Dorothy was working the bar and was very inviting. The whole crew was actually very sweet and welcoming. I tried to order Jameson and Ginger, but they ran out of it, so I ordered Crown and Coke instead. All of the guests dining were nice. They took pictures of me and my date and tried to engage in small talk, which he wasn't too fond of. Hahaha I love meeting new people. Two thumbs up!!!",

I love coming to the bar and getting my fix of asada, fish, and chicken tacos! Their tortillas are crack, always fresh and the weirdest dough where you can tell they are hand made and hold the taco so perfectly.  It's decorated so cute here, full of color and Mexican artifacts. The staff here are always nice and attentive which is awesome. I love that there is this location in the gramercy because I can get my drink on and take an uber home to my house down the street and it is larger than the location in container park downtown. Thanks for keeping my belly full, taco addiction, and michelada problem at bay!",

I replied thank you I didn't realize you've have given me extra things ..........she turned around and walked away ...I was in aw shocked like what just happened ....by the way there were two NHP officers inside and two or three tables occupied. She made it loud enough for all to hear. I will not be returning to this location. It's sad also I work right down the street in a 911 communications center. Was getting food for myself and co workers . Still have no idea what I did to deserve treatment like that and I was in full dress uniform also. So had to go Roberto's and get green sauce. after having to buy something there .",

The plate included rice, beans, & tortilla chips. $9.50 + additional $1.50 for Asada = $11 for my meal (+ tax).  I wish I enjoyed my meal more than I did, but 2 out of 3 tacos were too dry for me & were a bit bland. Maybe next time I'll ask for flour tortillas instead & add sour cream or guacamole. Hopefully that'll make a difference. The rice & beans were good, but nothing extraordinary about them.  I enjoyed the Lengua taco the most though. The meat was juicy & cooked perfectly. I'd definitely order that again if I go back.  The decor of the place is funky & artsy. The restaurant is hidden, though, so it can get confusing on which door is the entrance (happened to us).  Nonetheless, it's supposedly a hot & new restaurant. So, I'm willing to give it another shot sometime.",

The ambiance and vibe when you walk in is super trendy and cute. They told us to sit anywhere so we sat near by the food order station. Then we had a server come up and take our order. I ordered the carne asada fries and let me tell you, it was the BEST CARNE ASADA FRIES EVER! I was hooked! Then I decided to order churros with the horchata ice cream on top for dessert. Wow, talk about cherry on top. It was so good and it came with 4 mini churros and the scoop of ice cream in the middle!   Second and Third time I went with a few friends and ordered the same thing cause I was that OBSESSED! We went for event one time and the place was packed, but you can tell it was family owned that night since the whole family came out to help! It was awesome!  Totally a great spot to come and enjoy real authentic Mexican food with trendy vibes.",

My fiance and I met a friend here for some food and drinks before moving away from Las Vegas. This place always has a wait when you arrive because the food is that good. The atmosphere is great and trendy. Because of how busy it was the last time we went there, we weren't expecting to get our food served quickly, which we didn't. However, one of the servers came over and noticed that or food had not been deliverd to out table yet and she was very apologetic. She was so extremely nice, she let us know that our drinks where gonna be on the house and even offered to bring us another round, which we gladly accepted. Our food was then brought out immediately. The next thing you know, a gentleman by the name of Fernando came out with a bottle of Tequila and shot glasses and offered the 3 of us a free shot and we accepted. Fernando was so cool and even took a shot with us. This was amazing customer service as they made up for the fact the food was delayed to our table. All of this was unexpected as we were in good conversation and having a great time and we didn't even notice our food was delayed. Fernando and our server went above and beyond to show amazing customer service. This is a great place to grab some drinks and eat some great tacos. I will be back here for sure the next time I am back in town.",

Upon walking in, the place was packed and I was still welcomed graciously by the employees, which I later found out was one of the owners. I've opened a lot of restaurants and I know how rough openings are, but wow- they made it look easy. If it's this great already, I see a bright future for Pinches!  I tried the El Pastor taco & the pollo taco- both delicious. My first time having pastor and I was very impressed. My family has owned an authentic Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas since the 1960's, so I'm very picky when it comes to Mexican food, and I finally found one that I like. Quality ingredients, not just loaded with sour cream and cheese. The tortillas were handmade, and that makes ALL the difference.   There's outside patio seating available and a full bar area that's half inside and half out. The seating is very relaxed and spacious.  After speaking with the owner, Jorge Anaya aka \"Pinche\" I learned a little more about the restaurant. They have multiple locations in California and one in downtown Las Vegas. He was awesome and treated me like I was at home, very smart guy that you can tell cares about the very last detail of his food.    I can't wait to go back and try more on the menu!  In the words of Jorge, \"We don't take life seriously, we just take our tacos seriously.\"",

I ordered the carne, pastor and pollo in my combo with rice only. I did like the chicken which was moist but other than that it was just ok. We had ordered to go on a Saturday for lunch and there was no one there. I'm not sure that's a good sign. In fact they brought my food out 5 minutes later and so I left. Only to realize that I only had the burrito that my husband ordered and not my tacos...why they didn't tell me who knows?! So I had to drive back to get my tacos which were on the way to being soggy.   My husband wasn't impressed with his burrito that was 10 bucks either. He complained there wasn't enough meat for the cost. Overall I thought it was decent but it's definitely not my favorite place to get some tacos!",

I ask him what he thought and we both wrinkled our noses. They had a funny taste like the meat might have been prepared for a long while before we ate it. The meat was also slightly tough to chew. For the $16.00+- that we paid, we did finish. However, when a hungry homeless guy has to force  down the food. You do the math.  He ask me to give him cash to play KENO next year!",

WILL NEVER GO BACK.    they need to season their food, at least taste before you send them out to the paying guest.  Decor was great too look at, maybe they spent their monies on all that and their focus, when they should focus on their cooks and preps for their food.  I even had another co-worker that is having a birthday party celebration in container park tomorrow at their other location.  Now he doesn't want to go.  Maybe the liquor is better than their food.",

The beans are not cooked with lard, but still tasty enough. They smother the enchiladas with sour cream and cheese.  The service is great, they check on you often and seem to really care.   The search for authenticity continues.",

I wish the menu or the waitress told us the tacos come dressed. Meaning they have the cilantro, onion and salsa. I hate onions and I'm not of fan of red salsa for my tacos. After fixing them to my liking I noticed there was little meat. I had lengua,  al pastor, and carnitas and all were hidden by a big helping of cilantro, onion, salsa and/or pico de gallo. One of my tortillas was under cooked and all of them fell apart when you picked them up to eat. The meats were tasty but not enough for a serving. Stars for decor and friendly service but food is overpriced for the portions.  I was rooting for this place but at the end was disappointed.",

They have a table for 6 ( 2 - 4tops put together). In the sun. And it's really hot. But they said we don't like to put other tables together. Only other option? Share the huge table with the only other guests in the restaurant. Really. We cant just put two together that aren't in the sun and separate the table we're at. It might take 1 minute? Unbelievable start. Already a bad taste in my mouth and I have only ordered drinks. Also we are about to double your business right now. Literally.  So please show some hospitality and grab us a table not in the sun. Thanks a lot.  Food was ok. Service was kinda non existent   Waited over 30 minutes for the check. Someone had to take the check to he manager to pay while our server stood in the back on his phone. Terrible.  Party of 8.  Over $200 for tacos!! Go to CANTINA DORADO instead! Way way better",

The salsa for the chips was nothing more than chopped tomatoes, onions, jalapenos I think and a lil bit of cilantro. It had no flavor and too many onions and served on a almost flat plate so it was difficult to scoop it up. I forgot to order my tacos without onions and it had so many that I could not even pick them off, they were mixed in. The queso dip was the best part of my visit and the margaritas were pretty good too. The elote did not have enough topping on it and NO LIME!!   I would go again but just for margaritas and appetizers. Not the salsa though.",

The only thing I get when I come here is the pescado tacos - it is so freaking good and comes with this red sauce on top that goes really well with the fish. Im not sure if they have taco tuesday - weve gone in a few times on a Tuesday and no one has told us of any specials. WHY NO TACO TUESDAY. This is all.",

My favorite are the taquitos and the corn on the cob (elote style) is amazing.

    "text": "Came here over the weekend. Never would've known this place was there if someone hadn't told me. Consider it a hidden gem. Plenty of space when you walk in. No host was there when we arrived so not sure if there is one generally there. One of the servers who was helping another table said we could sit wherever we liked. There is vehicle built into the establishment which is an interesting touch. When you first walk in there is opening seating. When you proceed further there is a bar. The decorations in the establishment are all Hispanic based. Bright vivid pastel colors. This place serves up street taco style tacos (fit in the palm of your hand). The combo plate they have gives you 3 tacos, rice & beans. I ordered the asada (grilled angus beef), pescado (Fish with Veracruz cole slaw) & Pollo a la Parrilla (grilled chicken) w/ beans on the side for my date. My date ordered the combo plate w/ chicken & asada double rice. Her plate came out first & 5 minutes later my plate came out. This was odd to me that our food didn't come out at the same time.  The food was delicious. The fish was well put together w/ flavors. The chicken was not dry which can happen from time to time. It's flavoring was on point. The asada was the tastiest of the three in my opinion. However it was a close race for sure between the three. My date also enjoyed her tacos.  This is a place I will return to for more tasty tacos. As mentioned it's def a hidden gem of tasty goodness.",

I called ahead to make sure it was ok to bring my 1.5 and 4 year old, after reading some Yelp reviews I wasn't sure. They told me they had kid friendly food and booster seats. Unfortunately when I got there, only 1 booster seat was available. No biggie, the place was pretty busy and we were just happy to get a table quickly.  We ordered chips and salsa for the table, it was fine, nothing spectacular. I was probably most excited to try a blood orange margarita, it was pretty good! I tried elote for the first time. I never had it before but had always imagined it really spicy! It wasn't, but I still loved it. I had the carnitas taco and LOVED it! I would def go back for that alone. I'm no Mexican expert, this was basically my first real Mexican experience, but as much as I loved the carnitas, I didn't like the al pastor or asada tacos at all.  One of the reasons I liked this place is the loudness (like a cafeteria) and number of children there. We fit right in. We will be back as this place is close to home and we loved the margaritas!",

My latest trip I ordered the three taco combo plate. I got (1) Gringo Taco, which was on special, (1) Carne Asada Taco and (1) Al Pastor Taco. The Gringo taco was really really good and my favorite of the three. It was shredded beef with chipotle sauce and a crunchy shell. The other two were very delicious as well and were on a soft, handmade corn tortilla. I love that they are handmade and traditional, but they really fall apart on you while eating them. I ordered my combo plate with all beans, no rice. Their beans are good but I think they would benefit from just a little more flavor and salt.   We ended our meal by sharing the guava flan. We were very excited about this. Unfortunately, it was awful. The sauce was bitter and tasted burned. It may have been an off day for the flan and just a bad batch but it was very disappointing.   For lunch, for the three taco combo, it was about $13. (you have to pay extra for the carne asada) This is pretty high on my lunch budget and there are a lot of places you can go where you are served for less than that much per person. That is my main issue. But, you can definitely see where your extra dollars are being spent. Fresh ingredients that are handmade.  We will definitely be back in the near future.",

I even went on my birthday and I received a free cup cake which was delicious. I don't think they give free cup cakes for your birthday....I happened to receive one that day by chance because they had some.  -They also have great customer service. I ordered to go once and they forgot my churros, I called up and they acknowledged their mistake, apologized and gave me a refund with no hassle.  PARKING-Great amount of parking, never had a issue.   ATMOSPHERE-They play greatd music and part of the bar opens up to the outside which is nice when the weather is gorgeous. I highly recommend going for their happy hour or on taco Tuesdays for the food or both!!!!  DEALS-Happy Hour. Top items to get are the Gringo Tacos (make sure to use their hot sauce) Mexican Corn, Churros and Micheladas!!!!",

It's located behind a brand new apartment/condominium complex which looks vacant for the most part. It's not visible while driving down Russell so you're gonna have to turn into the plaza and drive towards the back. Parking is decent.   Atmosphere - Clean and very vibrant ; huge restaurant with tons of tables and chairs. I was the only one eating , however the location is new so it's probably going to take awhile before potential customers hear about it. Decor has traditional Mexican flair to it, complete with Mexican music. Huge windows all around the wall so there's tons of natural light.   Service - Quick service type ; you order at the counter and food is brought out to you. My order took 5 mins so no complaints from me. Lady behind the counter was friendly and helpful.   Food - Decent ; it's not bad but it isn't mind blowing either. I ordered their Torta al Pastor and a drink. Personally, the pastor lacks flavor. It's not horribly bad. I was satisfied with my meal but I wish it could've been better. I guess I'm spoiled by Taco y Taco and Tacos el Gordo's Pastor offerings. On the plus side, their Tortas are huge. I had a stuffed belly after I devoured it.   Final Thoughts - Food is OK. It's my first time and I can't really judge of a horrible experience because of my first meal. I'll definitely be back and try their Asada or something. It's a good quick place to grab a bite if you're craving Mexican food . Just keep your expectations at bay though .",

I was surprised by how hidden this place was from the street. You have to turn into the driveway and drive around to the back of the building where the restaurant is located.  I ordered the combination tacos of beef tongue, asada, and adobada. I enjoyed the beef tongue the best. It was very, very tender. It came with rice, and chips and beans - no complaints here. I also got an order of the Mexican corn. This totally hit the spot! It was coated in the sauce and a nice layer of Parmesan cheese. Delicious! The corn was huge too! I would go back just for the Mexican corn.",

    "text": "Have been here twice, and both times the service was pretty non existent. We came in today to give it another shot and the gentleman who places the food orders was not very helpful, nor did he offer much insight into what we should be ordering. Disappointed when staff doesn't take the time to guide you through the menu or suggestively sell to you. I ordered a three tacos combination plate, 2 chicken, 1 carne asada, with rice/beans and chips. My friend ordered the flan even though the guy at the counter said he \"wasn't a flan type of guy\". We went to the bar to grab some drinks. No one approached us for awhile and when the bartender did acknowledge us, I asked if we could order with her. She was a bit defensive and said she thought we had already been helped. My friend ordered a michelada and I ordered a blood orange margarita. Drinks were okay, I thought mine was pretty weak honestly and the tequila used is Toro. This is the stuff that makes people hate tequila! Processed & fake, surely a headache waiting to happen but the blood orange mix made it palatable and out of desperation to at least feel some sort of buzz I ordered a second one. The michelada was okay, not as traditional as we are used to but nonetheless it was drank. The food came out and the tacos are on the smaller side, and the chips are literally about 6 chips. I was disappointed by the portion, and how little meat were on the tacos. Whatever, I ate them because I was starving and the flavor was decent. The flan isn't the prettiest, but my friend said it was good. Lastly we ordered an elote to go and asked for the check. The bartender grabbed the corn right away and then we waited for awhile for the check. Her computer wasn't able to print and she seemed flustered by this. Eventually she just verbally told us the total, and to make sure it wasn't some scam she might be trying to pull to cheat the restaurant, I paid with a card. I know that sounds terrible to even think that, but it's a thing that really does happen. While waiting for our check, the guy (who I assume was a servers assistant) was behind the bar helping out, at one point he proceeded to put on gloves to cut something and dropped a glove on the ground of the bar. He then proceeded to pick said glove up and put it on anyways and began prepping food. That turned my stomach, and then the headache began to set in from the Toro tequila. Our overall impression was that the staff really didn't want to be there, not very friendly or personable at all; and seeing that all of the FOH staff were frequently on their phones or ignoring you I'd say I wouldn't go back anytime soon.",

We waited for at least 15min before even being acknowledged then another 10min for our micheladas. She said she would be right back to take our food order but never came back we legit waited another 45min before leaving. It seemed the bartenders friends were more important than taking care of regular guests cause the people next to us got there food and refilled drinks, every time I tried to get someone's attention they wouldn't even look our way. I'm sure this place is great and the food is great but they really need to work on service specially at the bar and not making us feel like we don't exist! I hate giving bad reviews but this was not cool specially being in the bar industry!!  Edit- this place has grown on me since the last time I've been here and the manager was super cool!

The walls are pink and drinks are plentiful.   I ordered 2 alpastor tacos and an adobado taco and their Mexican corn on the cob. We also got chips and salsa to share. To be honest I can't tell which taco was which but they were all delicious. It's not a good as tacos el Gordo though and not as good as the street tacos in la.  However for 2 bucks I thought they were a great deal. Their Guac is delicious!  I thought it was seasoned perfectly. The waitress was also really nice and gave me two corns because she said that they are coming out pretty small. They looked really big to me but when I bit in there was no sweet juicy corn flesh.. It was all dried shrunken corn skin. I don't know if it was sitting out for a while.. Boiled since yesterday.. Or the corn was just not in season... But it wasn't that great and I was disappointed because Mexican corn is one of my favorite things.   I would come back here again for happy hour because it's a good deal.",

Today we ordered 90 worth of food for our call center through door dash. When we got the door dash half the order is missing (the guy who completed our door dash was wonderful through out and helping us with them) and this manager at Pinches says she doesn't believe we are missing anything but half of the office is eating and the other half is not and they are fighting us on the phone. They don't care and are being incredibly rude and to top it off she decided to hang up on us when asked what we should do. We have spent literally hundreds of dollars here if not more and this is it, we will not be back. Calling your customers liars and then being completely rude?? No excuse and we will be disputing the charge. We added up what we got vs what we paid for. 85 dollars spent and we only received about 42 dollars of that... order take out with caution because if they mess up it will be your fault.

It's expected to clean the restaurant when it is slow, but the smell was strong enough to the point where it was bothersome while eating. Maybe don't go all out of the cleaning chemicals when there are two more hours of business left.  A friend and I ordered the carne asada fries while another friend ordered the 3 taco combination plate. Our carne asada fries came out pretty quick and looked appetizing, but didn't meet our expectations. For the price of $11 or $12, the portions are smaller than most of the Mexican restaurants that serve carne asada/ any other meat with fries. With there being a smaller portion size, we were hoping that the meat would be better than the casual Mexican food restaurant. At best, the meat may have been very slightly better.  My friend that got the 3 taco combination plate was displeased. He complained about how the beans were watery and that the tacos were just alright. The amount of money he spent on his meal he said could have gotten him a lot more at other places that had better quality as well.  Although I wasn't a fan of their food, I did like their counter which is a full scale taco truck and their decorations.",

We go here every so often and we've never been disappointed. Taco Tuesday is a must! The food is to die for and it tastes even better when mixed with the chill atmosphere and great service you get whole you're there. 5/5 would recommend!",

I always ask for hot sauce, which they make in-house. And they're only $2 each during happy hour. Happy hour is ALL DAY Monday. Then, Tuesday- Sunday, 3-7pm. I've tried each of their $4 margaritas and they're all really good. My favorite is the Blood Orange & White peach. I also had their Michelada which is good but I wish they rimmed the glass with Tajin or something. That would make it so much better. I definitely recommend this place. The food 10/10, price 10/10, and environment 10/10!",

I kept seeing it on instagram and we ordered to go. We got the chicken street tacos and the Asada fries. Everything was good but those asada fries were Amazing! So much so that I am back again today because my husband felt that we needed to eat it again lol. As I sit here waiting on my order I see the bar is pretty fully stocked with any of your favorite liquors you can ask for and the vibe is pretty chill. It sounds like I will be frequently coming here.",

I had 3 tacos of various proteins which the fillings were good, but the corn tortillas were mushy and grainy liked they were not cooked all the way. Wife had a chicken burrito that she described as the worst she's ever had. Barely any chicken in it and mostly beans and guacamole that desperately needed seasoning. El Pollo loco and Roberto's have way better chicken burritos. One a good note, service was great. It's a shame as we really liked the location and atmosphere, but the food needs some overhaul.",

At the 5, 10 and 15 minute mark other tables (parties of 4 and 5) were seated and each of them had their drink AND food orders taken. We still had not had anyone approach to offer water. And the kids were at their limit of keeping their cool so we got up and left. None of the servers seemed to care.   Being from SoCal I put up with over paying for mediocre tacos at this place but you couple it with garbage service? Forget this place. Pinches tacos? More like pinches nada or Mas Puto. I do hope this place goes away and makes way for something that actually serves their customers.",

After we ordered, we promptly received our drinks and order of chips, salsa and guac. Then a large group made its way into the bar area and all the wait staff's attention diverted to the large crowd. We gave them the benefit of the doubt and patiently waited for our food, but once the crowd dissipated, the server didn't come to check on us at all. He then comes from around the bar, walks to one side of the restaurant chatting with what seemed like regulars along the way, disappeared in the back, then came back out phone in hand, walked past our table and headed outside with a customer or fellow waiter (not sure). Some time went by and finally a waitress came by and asked if we were ok. We told her that we were waiting on our food. She went to the bar and asked staff, who were drinking (presumably after clocking out for the day), where the waiter went, which was met with shrugs and puzzled looks. Some more time went by and eventually we see the waitress head into the kitchen and come back with our food. While we ate our meal, we see the waiter standing behind the bar, talking to various patrons and then sit at the bar with a drink in hand and enjoying the football game. If he was off for the day and enjoying some after work drinks with friends, that's fine and dandy, but for us to not be informed of his departure and a staff change (as is normally done at most restaurants), that comes off highly unprofessional.  I gave this place a second chance after a bad food experience at their downtown location, but definitely will not be returning to this or any other Pinches Tacos locations.",

The burrito was wrapped aluminum foil as if it was to go, a turn off.  They had no hot sauce, just some insipid heat adding pink stuff in a squeeze bottle.  No salad, no atmosphere.  Cute decor if you like the day of the dead skulls (gringo) and way too loud music.  I wish I'd read the other reviews from disappointed customers prior to my visit.

I live all the way in north town so I'll admit I've taken awhile to try it out but I'm glad I finally made it to this fun and colorful taco spot ..  My boyfriend lives on the south side so we decided to check this place out after our originally choice had a long wait.. we arrived about thirty minutes before happy hour ended so I went ahead and tried a $4 margarita .. my waitress recommended the blood orange as the crowd please so I went with that one and I was pleasantly surprised how much I liked it that I opted to get two lol which was probably a mistake in hindsight after sitting there trying to finish it with such a full belly .. which brings me to the most important part the food LOL   We started off with chips and guacamole which is one of the major reasons I can't go all out with a five star rating .. I feel like it was lacking flavor and just didn't do it for me but the chips were pretty good ..  During happy hour they have $2 taco specials so I opted to try as many tacos as I thought I could possibly stomach a bite or two of without going into a food coma ... let's just say I ended up with five tacos on my plate and the only two I could finish were the Gringo and the mole taco.. honestly the Gringo was my favorite (wonder why?) .. It's an off menu hard shell house speciality I definitely recommend it ... I enjoyed the flavor of their mole taco and I felt like the fish taco was really good (fish and shrimp tacos aren't HH specials ) the shrimp taco was too fishy for my taste buds .. maybe I'm a shrimp taco snob tho... My guy gots Carnitas taco and honestly that was the best flavored meat of the tacos I tried from here ... I also tried the cactus taco which again was good but not worth my tummy space ..  My favorite item here was the Elote (Mexican corn on the cob) I requested it off the cob and they brought it out with a spoon , yes only a single spoon .. I can say that was a bit puzzling to me since we were a party of two but hey .. next time I'll make sure to order and make the special request lol  Overall this place is such a fun experience just due to the decor.. I don't know if I will go back unless it's during Happy Hour and I'm on this side of town but for a Mexican experience with a more Americanized feel without being chipotle .. I definitely recommend checking this place out ... especially if you're a nerd like myself who just loves the ambiance and decor..",

I ordered a blood orange margarita because that is the house specialty. It was really good.   I think ordered the three taco combo. I tried the pork, pollo mole and the cameron (shrimp). It also came with rice and beans. I should have just ordered the tacos separately because I was too full for the rice and beans. I really liked the shrimp taco.   Although it's not my favorite it's up there with one of the good taco places in Vegas.",

They do have taco Tuesday's and it's a great deal. The reason I gave it 3 stars is the customer service. The first time I figured maybe the lady was having a bad day. We all do. So I tried again n it was another girl n she was just as much in a bitchy mood as the other lady the last time. This was my observation from a distance with other customers as well. They don't like if you ask questions. It definitely pisses them off if they have to answer questions especially when it's your first time there. They ain't having it!

What a fun place that uses a food truck as an ordering window. Our server took our order so that we did not have to place it ourselves at the window. Food is delivered to the table identified by the number received at time of ordering.  Our lunch order consisted of the Taco Combination Plate and a Pinches Bean Burrito with cheese. The combination plate includes any 3 tacos plus, refried beans and tortilla chips. I chose the Adobada (chili marinated pork), Camaron (shrimp) and Pescado (fish). The seafood tacos come with Veracruz  coleslaw on top. The tacos can be ordered with deep fried seafood instead of grilled. I ordered grilled and both were delicious. The chili marinated  pork was tender and had great flavor. The coleslaw provides a nice crunch. The rice is pretty standard. I liked the beans because they are thick, no gravy, perfect for the chips.   I would order these again but I have my eyes on the the Burritos for next time. Also looking forward to the outdoor patio. Take time to check out the wall art especially the tiles in the bathroom.",

By the way, we're Mexican so, we know about flavor and we were just disappointed of how their flavor of food tasted like.  As for me, I ordered horchata, Mexican corn on the cob, and a chicken burrito. The horchata was delicious. The Mexican corn on the cob was okay, it wasn't the best- I couldn't really taste anything. The Mexican sour cream wasn't popping. The chile powder wasn't spicy. The cheese wasn't popping as well. As for my chicken burrito, it was boring and flavorless too; It included red rice, beans, and guacamole. The guacamole was probably the only thing I could taste.

    "text": "The atmosphere is very cool and \"hip\" but they need to figure out their service.  They have a walk-up window at a food truck (inside) but we were told to sit down and they would serve us.  The service was very slow and we had to find someone to get drink refills, long after they should have been taken care of. They have a Coke Freestyle machine but it was out of order and we were drinking iced tea anyway. We also waited an inordinate amount of time for our check.  (We were there at 2 pm on a Friday; they were not busy). I ordered the combination plate of 3 tacos, which comes with rice & beans. I asked for no beans but they brought them anyway. The tacos are just okay. Not bad, but not so good I feel the need to go back.  I had carnitas, chicken, and adobada. They were all smothered in salsa and I really couldn't tell the difference between them, flavor wise.   I think this location would be good for happy hour or hanging out after work. It's not great for families or for date night, in my opinion.",

The atmosphere was really fun and the owner Javier was super nice and sweet! They were giving out free beer and sangria on top of some free appetizers. Place was pack and everyone seem to be enjoying themselves very much and having such a great time. Towards the end of the night I got to try their food. Had their Mexican corn on the cob with mayo and cheese, yum. Then I tried their 3 taco plate combo, 1 chicken mole, 1 veggie and an alpastor taco. Loved them all very good flavor. Over all cannot wait to come back again and try more of the food they have to offer.",

The place is very well lit and the decor is bright and fun. However, our server seemed displeased and barely even spoke to us. I ordered the 3 taco combination plate and I was very disappointed. The meat was great quality but no flavor. The beans and rice that came with the meal also tasted watered down with no flavor at all. 2 beers and 2 taco combination plates for 39 dollars was not worth it. Food was not good enough for me to come back.",

My first time here I was happy to try half the tacos on the menu and thoroughly enjoyed the meats.  However, some meats like the roasted chicken lacked salt and there's none on the tables.  The salsas that come on the tacos lack flavor.  The green salsa which is made with tomatillos has no kick to it.  Some tortillas ripped as well but it's a sacrifice I'm willing to take for fresh made tortillas.  Do yourself a flavor and avoid the beans and rice.  I will drop by during Happy Hour on a game night, if I'm in the area.",

When I heard they were opening down the street from where I live at the Gramercy, I was so excited!  We dined there today and it was as delicious as their downtown location.    Hubs and I each had a few of their chicken tacos and their al pastor tacos.  We also split a Mexican Corn on the Cob.    Service was friendly and our food came out quick.  They weren't very busy, they had maybe 2 other table, but their grand opening is tomorrow.  I hope they get enough business for them to stay there.  They are very popular at their downtown location.",
