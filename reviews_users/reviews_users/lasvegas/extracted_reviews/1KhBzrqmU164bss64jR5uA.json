The food is FABULOUS all the way around. Ordered The Pit Combination which was PERFECT to share - 5 of their smoked meats AND 3 sides - got their house salad (best toppings super yummy mixed greens) smoked mac & cheese and house made pig skins.  There are plenty of BBQ sauce choices and all are fantastic too.",

Cons- way over priced. For a party of four we paid $85 for four sandwiches and sides (extra) with drinks (non alcohol). The portions are decent but nothing more than you would get at a sandwich shop.   Other thoughts- Atmosphere was nothing spectacular you sit on plastic stools and most people that came were ordering to go. My suggestion is go to Ricks pawn shop across the parking lot, but skip his over priced restaurant.",

Our bartender/bar manager was super friendly; we had a good time getting to know him.   My partner and I were in Vegas for a weekend getaway and came across their 2nd floor bar after checking out the Gold & Silver Pawn Shop. We went in for just a drink but decided to have a nibble and ordered the Duo Choice of 2 Meats (ribs and brisket) with one side (mac & cheese). The ribs were good, the brisket was a bit dry and the mac & cheese was fine. The food just wasn't hot and fresh.   I think this place has potential though! The second floor is a nice space to hangout for locals and visitors (have a bevvie and yummy bbq). If they improved on the food, it can go a long way!",

    "text": "We love trying out new restaurants whenever we go to Vegas, and were in the mood for some BBQ. Rollin' Smoke was nearby, so we decided to try it out.  I will say, before walking in I thought it would be a touristy BBQ joint. It shares the parking lot with the Pawn Stars shop and the building looks a little hipster.   We were greeted by a guy behind the counter commenting on my t-shirt. He began talking basketball with us and he seemed to genuinely enjoy his job.  Looking at the menu, I could see that this place knew how to do brisket. They had options of chopped, sliced, or burnt ends. I got half sliced and half chopped. The worker went and grabbed the full slab of meat to cut it in front of us.  The sauces included a sweet sauce, which tastes better than it sounds. Unlike other sweet sauces, this one isn't syrupy and cloyingly sweet. Then there's the Arkansauce, which is truly unique, perfectly concocting pepper, tomato, and meat sauces in one.  The chopped brisket was so flavorful and moist we didn't even need sauce at all. But if you choose to, I recommend the sweet sauce. It runs over it nicely and only adds to the amazing quality of meat.   The sliced brisket is almost as good. It's less fatty, but you'd never guess by how easily your teeth slice through it. Both meat options are reminiscent of genuine Texas brisket in every way.  My only gripe here is the price. It's $16 per 1/2 lb of brisket--so $32 per pound. That's a little steep. I realize it's in Vegas and the meat is fantastic, but I think charging by the pound would be smarter--maybe $25 per pound. For those who don't eat a lot of BBQ, $16 per half pound doesn't seem like much, but it's very far above average. If you get the combo, it's $20 and it comes with a side and a drink. The sides are usually $4 a la carte--so you basically get the drink for free.  For the sides, I highly recommend the mac & cheese. I got the baked sweet potato, which is an extra $2 and not really worth it.   Each meal also comes with a slice of Texas toast, smartly placed underneath the meat so that it gets nice a soggy (trust me, it's amazing).  I will definitely be back here, but perhaps only order the meat by itself and get a larger portion of the side to share instead of both of us getting a meal (I don't drink soda).   It's great that Vegas has a quality BBQ spot for locals to get some brisket cooked the right way.",

The food was just ok but the prices were way over what they should be for a get it yourself food bar.

A good value and taste as well.  Easy parking for the area.  Ate upstairs in the bar, service was polite and friendly but slow and inattentive.   I will repeat the place for the food, for sure, actually some of the best bbq. in Vegas.",

    "text": "Not very good. Kinda a fake BBQ joint. Sweet tea was out of a \"gold peak dispenser\". Meat was served ice cold. I got the beef brisket and pulled pork. Beef brisket was chopped so fine it had the consistency of canned dog food. Once again the meat was ice cold like it came out of the freezer. I watched the server scoop it out of a container that should have been hot. Real Pulled pork would be pulled when you ordered it not pulled hours before and stuck in the fridge to be reheated later. It was ice cold. It was expensive. I had a local discount. Two meals with drinks were $32 with the discount. $40 for non locals. Coleslaw was good. BBQ was just not quality or authentic in any way. Rick likes to call in a expert on his pawn star show all the time. He should call in a BBQ expert to show him how to do BBQ the right way. I have tasted BBQ all over this country. I would not return to this joint o recommend it. I should have known better when there were no customers in the place. Lesson learned.",

With reservations at Jasmine at the Bellagio at 6:45 Monday night, we wanted a snack at 3:30, and split a delicious burnt-end brisket sandwich at the diner Rick opened next to the Pawn Shop.  It was SO GOOD that on our way out of town on Tuesday we detoured on the way to the airport for lunch.  There had just been a run on the burnt ends, but a new batch was cookin' , so we waited for 20 minutes.  Tess and I each had a sandwich, and the food and the service were both fantastic!  If you are a capsaicin fan, ask for some of the \"hot\" sauce on the side (the plastic cup in the photo) - very flavorful, with definite habanero notes, nicely balanced by the sugar.  We will definitely return when we are next in Vegas - I'm dying to try his 2016 award-winning ribs (although it will be hard not to just get the burnt end sandwich!).",

The batch I had was a little stale.   I would use the Mexican style pork rind known as a (Chicharron) this type would be a hit I'm sure.   I'll definitely be back to try more of the BBQ.

Driving my brother-in-law around Vegas and I asked if he's been to the Pawn Stars establishment. He says yes, but he wants to try out the BBQ. Hooray! Thank goodness he understood what I was hinting at.  Their parking lot has always been small. We got there right before lunch and luckily, the parking lot wasn't as busy as I was able to immediately get a parking space. Love that this restaurant is on the ground floor.  My brother-in-law and I didn't want to eat a whole lot, although the All You Can Eat at $40/person was appealing. We opted for the Brisket Sandwich combo which also comes with mac n' cheese, pork and beans and a drink. Total price, $25. Glad we were sharing because that is a pricey. Luckily, the drink cup was the souvenir drink cup which is normally $5. We liked the brisket sandwich. I poured the pork and beans over the mac n' cheese and that was great.  The restaurant workflow makes sense. You walk in, you stand in line at the counter and give the server your order, followed by the cashier, fountain drinks and utensils. The entire restaurant is \"pub\" seating, either window seats or shared large eating counter.  Between every couple of seats are napkin dispensers along with different sauces you can try, including Sweet and Arkansas. Everything made sense, everything was clean.  I'll definitely be back to share the experience with my family and friends who are Pawn Star fans.",

We came in and we instantly greeted by the friendly staff. The gentleman suggested we try #7 to share, it included 3 sides with  brisket, ribs, sausage & chicken for $35. The macaroni & cheese and potatoes salad is delicious. Cynthia and Eric made out first time dining here a very memorable one. Ask for the dessert menu I tried the strawberry shortcake with cornbread which it satisfies my sweet tooth craving.",

What you do not see is a building across the parking area that house some interesting business's also involving the family of 'Pawn Stars'.  A 'Chumley' candy store.  There is also a Mexican and Pizza jaunt but what sticks out is Rick's barbecue jaunt.  You can go upstairs and have a drink whilst some bbq eats whilst overlooking the hoards of tourist's walking by.  A lot of patio seating amongst the side of the property.  Some fun dishes and brews and on Saturday's you might get to meet ole Rick himself!    It was a fun stop, delicious sliders and mingling with the locals!",

The chicken tacos came with pico de gallo and a little bit of sour cream, but they were packed with flavor. This is strictly a meat shop, with minimal options. There were no options to mix and match meats. It's either ribs or chicken, can't do both. Everything is a la cart.  Drinks: We didn't have drinks, but there were several beer options, cans and on tap.  Ambience: The restaurant is up top and has an outside patio with several tv's for entertainment. They kitchen sends the food up a shoot.   Staff: Everyone is friendly. The bartender is befit aria which I thought was funny.  Parking: Parking lot and street parking   Overall Experience: A nice place to try, I would go back if my hubs wanted to go and I would recommend going if you like bbq. 4/5",

I ordered the dual plate for my other half and added ribs for myself. Best bang for your bucks!  Their atmosphere is clean and have lots of space.  Tv for entertainment.   I LOVE their smoked meats here!!!! Definitely eating my smoked meats from here no where else! I love the fact that their bar is upstairs and Resturant down stairs because when you're with your family or friends that have children they can join you down stairs. I recommend this bar and restaurant to everyone!",

We order the sliders and redneck nachos (because we like trying new stuff). The sliders (just two) were supposed to be brisket but they were full of fat!! My husband loves fat so he was ok with it but it literally had two chunks of meat/fat in each and were incredibly small for $11. The redneck nachos (pictured) were incredibly small as well for $11 I expected them to be a decent size. We are not on the strip there is no reason to be gouged for less than mediocre food. I love food! I LOVE BBQ but I will NEVER EVER EVER be back, this place is a waste of your time. I will say that I did like their $2 surprise shot. That is not enough to keep me satisfied. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time go to the original or go to Lucille's instead.",

Hey stick with the ribs, add as much sauce as you like and drink lots of beer and hmmm, it's pretty damn good and the price is right.

And I noticed every person who has asked for a picture he said ask him and pointed to his asswipe shadow who followed him everywhere.. Antwon , So I asked Rick to take a picture and referred me to Antwon, couldn't be more dissapointment with Rick and the establishment.. It's obvious the guy stepped into shit when the history channel came into his life.. He must have been a failure before then..Now he thinks he's better than everyone else, I met plenty of reality stars in the past and they were all gracious, Not Rick, proved to be the biggest jerkoff I have ever met from the world of reality tv..",

We came in on the 4th of July around 2pm expecting a long wait and were pleasantly surprised to have NO wait ! Not only was there no wait , but we were greeted with great service and smiling faces . It took a little while for the 3 of us to make up our minds on our meat choices but the cook gave us samples of his selections to help us narrow it down . The prices are a little up there BUT locals get a 30% discount with ID  ! We ended up ordering the 3 meat combos and got banana pudding as our dessert . AMAZE . I highly recommend this place for your BBQ needs . It's technically on the strip , but it's right off the freeway so you don't have to travel trough all the usual slow and go .",

Lots of beef on it this should be two pieces instead of one. It taste good. One was tender and the other piece was brought was little dry. We will come back but try something else before i bring friends and family.",

We had greens, which usually I'm not a big fan, but these were really tasty.  I wish I had been hungrier, I would have finished them off.  Also had corn bread, which was really moist and super good.

They give away a souvenir cup with it, but theres no way to opt out and pay a normal price for a drink. Then on top of that, a side is also an additional fee. Basically, you'll spend $20-$25 for a simple lunch, just for yourself.  On the plus side though, Free parking (a rarity in this area) and food was definitely delicious.

What's different here than most BBQ joints is that they let you sample something if you're on the fence about it. I'm always on the hunt for a good pork or beef rib so luckily they didn't have to help me too much with my lunch decision,   I must say, they are definitely doing something right with their St. Louis ribs! The succulent meat just falls right off the bone. I'm so glad I went with the half rack because three (3) ribs would have not sufficed. At the ordering counter they drizzle a bit of the Arkansauce on top but  they have three different sauces on the tables/ bar stool area that are great on the ribs as well if you want extra flavor.   Sides: Smoked Mac & Cheese, ALL DAY, ERRRDAY!  The Mac & Cheese here has a slight dark yellow color to it but don't be alarmed, it's not spicy, it's smoked! Perhaps they add the Arkansauce to it as well but trust me, this is absolutely cheesy goodness. It's rich in cheesy flavors and it pairs excellent with any BBQ of your choice. If you're going to indulge in carbs, I would highly recommend not passing up on this side!  *Little steep in their prices but I think their BBQ delivers in the flavor department so they could get away with it.",

The brisket sandwich was burnt, small portion and no flavor. The Mac and cheese, also burnt. The strawberry shortcake, I thought would be good, but came in a pre prepared cup. It was disgusting. It looks rotten. It was soggy. I definitely wouldn't eat here again. Maybe for drinks, but driving tonight so couldn't partake. Probably because Pawn Stars ship next door, good crowd, bad food.  Hopefully comedy is better!",

We are probably spoiled since we travel around and have had some of the best BBQ in the country.  On side note service was good",

We were offered the discount beverages with the meal. At checkout the meal was affordable and the least expensive meal we have had since being in Vegas....and after eating this rolling smoke meal....the best meal by far. The patrons in the bar were friendly and welcoming as well. The atmosphere was great, prices were just right, the food was incredible, and the deals are amazing.",

I was shocked to see that the meat I was given was literally, 4 pieces of thinly sliced hot links and 3 pieces of thinly sliced beef brisket, a smaller than normal size side and a small souvenir soda cup, which was nothing but a cheapy thin-plastic cup.   Waaay OVER priced for the quantity of food that you get and to top it off, the quality is subpar and lacking.   The bbq sauce is runny and bland. The brisket is dry and flavorless. The hot links are nothing but hot...that is literally all you taste is overpowering heat!   Definitely a touristy spot/trap.

I added the sweet bbq sauce on top and even though it did have sweet notes, the sauce had a little kick to it (which was nice but if you have a sensitive stomach maybe skip on the sauce). For my side i had the smoked mac n cheese, which also had a little spice to it but not too much, i also got hints of what tasted like gravy in it ...that was a interesting but great flavor! The bf tried the 1/2 smoked chicken and ate every bit,juicy, tender and had a nice smoked flavor were his words while eating. The service from the staff was outstanding, chef cory was very informative and friendly!",

Now, we had their nachos with the brisket. Outstanding. Great flavor, the cheese is authentic and the Arkansas barbecue sauce on the side is flavorful. We went upstairs to try out a few beverages and a little bit of eats. Mark is the bartender up there and he is everybody's friend. A rare talent. The atmosphere is great especially with the balcony looking out onto Las Vegas Blvd. and the gold and silver pawn store next-door. I would recommend this to anyone. Oh, by the way, if anyone is wondering, I was not bribed to do this.",

We were pleasantly surprised when the doorman informed the crowd inside the Pawn Shop that Rick was making drinks at his bar. We headed over forgetting bars don't let in \"under 18-ers.\" (My son was with us). We were sent out of the bar, but Eddie brought us complimentary sodas and said Rick \"might\" come out for the kids.   AND HE DID!!! He took a photo with my son and then I snuck in one with them. Not sure if Rick approved of what I did but I'm sure he knows how the \"kids\" get to his shop;-)   In gratitude for the sodas and the photo-op, we ate downstairs at the BBQ place. Food was highly flavorful and scrumptious! I loved the souvenir cups, the stickers for my son's skateboard, and the mac-and-cheese!! What I loved the MOST, though, at the Pawn Shop and BBQ place was the staff. Every single one of them was outgoing, courteous, and friendly (especially Eddie!). Food prices were what I'd expect it to be: 2 meals with sides and drinks were $40 and don't forget the cup is yours to keep and refillable sodas.   Glad we went! Thank you Rick for the picture and thank you Eddie for the hospitality!! You made our trip and ya'll mean that much more to us now!!",

The food is Higher priced so if BBQ is what you are looking for there are less expensive options BUT their BBQ and side are rather tasty. Came here because it is owned By Rick and is next door to their Famed Pawn Shop store.  Again BUT, they do offer a generous Military/ 1st Responder discount.  Thx Rick.   Thought of this place because I watched Rick on Fox News last night speaking with Mark Levin.   I will come back here.  PS. The 3 meat, 1 side with a drink for $28 is easily shareable.",

I actually pawned a ring once that a woman sent to me while I was on 'Jerry Springer.' It was really gaudy.\" Steve Wilkos  Personally I kinda wish I could pawn the flavor left on my taste buds.  Let me start off by saying that I have had food from the original location of Rollin Smoke BBQ and that was was pretty special. You would think the food at this location would be just as special.  My younger daughter, here's a surprise she wanted to eat mac n cheese. My wife took a bite of the mac n cheese. For a side dish that cost $8.00 she, my wife, said it tasted like it came from a can. My daughter at the age of seven was not impressed as well.  My older daughter, age nine, choose to eat a cheeseburger. The portion size was fine, but she was not to favorable for it's taste. I took a bite and thought I was taking a bite from a meatloaf sandwich.   Myself I ordered BBQ Taco for $12.00. My meal came with a side dish of cole slaw. I also ordered some baked beans. I liked my side dishes more than I liked my tacos.  Service was nice, the establishment inside was very clean. Then again it was only 11:30am.  Located in a brand new shopping area right next to the shop made famous on the television show Pawn Stars.   I love the food from the other location, but here, and with Rick's name on it, something was missing. My wife and I agree, we didn't get the bang for our buck. I do feel like we payed for the name along with the location, and not so much the food.",

Someone asked me if I was local and I said yes and they let me Park for free. I love a place that appreciates the locals.   Once inside the prices seemed a little high, but I love their BBQ and I was hungry. I ordered the brisket and he informed me that locals device 20%off. It's totally my fault for ignoring the price for sides and drinks... But $5 for cole slaw is robbery! I wasn't thrilled that my soda (including a plastic souvenir cup) was $5 either. The brisket was exactly as i remember it and I really like the BBQ sauce. I like a nice mix of the original and spicy. Perfection!   The original location is actually slightly closer to my work, and the prices are a little better (even with 20% off) so I think I'll stick to that one as my main location, but this is great for anyone interested in the pawn shop show.",

I think they should try something more interesting or exotic, like \"homemade\" Southern Iced Tea.  But that is quibbling. The servers are down-to-earth and know the food.

    "text": "2 stars for a solid BBQ joint with one glaring problem.  After checking out the famous Gold & Silver Pawn Shop from the television show \"Pawn Stars,\" we headed next door to the BBQ shop owned by show's star, Rick. The joint, called Rick's Rollin Smoke BBQ & Tavern, is a 2-story venue with what looked like a take out area on the bottom level and a bar and outdoor area on the top level. The venue's style as a BBQ joint is well executed and made this Kansas City boy feel like he was back in the Midwest.  We sat down at a table and a bartender came over to say hello and bring us menus. She also let us know that Rick himself would be bartending tonight, so we were free to stick around to see him or come back and see would make sure we be able to get a drink from him. I appreciated that she was very friendly and overall provided good service.   After looking over the rather extensive menu (including a good sized beer list), my wife and I decided to get a couple beers and some sliders. While our dinner reservations kept us from ordering more, both the beers and sliders we received were rather solid. The venue, service and food all corresponded with the venue's 4 star status.   What is unfortunate is that, while the venue's food and experience merit 4 star reviews (and would have gotten one from me), it takes the extremely inappropriate step of manipulating its rating. It does this with a little sign on the table, listed in the picture below, offering a free PBR or mystery shot in exchange for being willing to \"Yelp us out.\" Since the sign instructed me to ask the server for details, I asked the server and she told me that we would only receive the free drinks in exchange for a good review! ARE YOU SERIOUS?! This is an absolutely despicable policy that hurts Yelp (posting of inauthentic reviews), insults Yelpers who look to provide honest input and the venue itself because it is less likely to receive constructive criticism that would help it improve. It is one thing to encourage people to write a review for a drink (a little shady in its own right since people would most likely avoid criticizing the venue since it could jeopardize receiving their free drink, but outweighed by the benefit of getting people to write reviews), but offering free drinks for a review AND requiring the reviews to be good crosses the line. The saddest part about this is that the venue would almost assuredly get good reviews and repeat business based on its merits, but this policy is so harmful and insulting that I refuse to go back to this location and recommend everyone avoid it until the policy is eliminated or at the very least reworked to remove the positive review requirement. While the official policy may not involve the positive review requirement, the servers would need to be instructed that this isn't a requirement and the sign updated to reflect that the content of the review wouldn't impact receiving the drink.  Overall, Rick's Rollin Smoke BBQ & Tavern is a solid BBQ location with a great atmosphere and menu full of good options. Unfortunately, the abhorrent Yelp policy makes this a place a must avoid for any self-respecting Yelper.",

    "text": "Best bbq hands down. Don't forget your local discount! So Ricks serves up a vinegar based bbq and their sauces are on the sweet side but can deliver some serious heat.   My go to is the 5 meats special. They give you so much meat! I like that they also ask what type of brisk3 you'd prefer. They have all the meats too. The hot links are the best I've ever had. The only way they could get better is adding turkey and spam. Got hooked on smoked spam in Hawaii and think it would really go over well in Vegas.  The meat special usually feeds 3 of us for a day or two with everyone getting what they like. I'm super impressed with the quality. They make sure you get some burnt ends and I've never had an issue with getting lots of fat. Even their ribs are amazingly meaty. I never eat bone in ribs because I hate fat and gristle. When my family caught me eating these ribs they were shocked.   I haven't tried all the sides yet because I got stuck at the coleslaw and my kid can't live without the beans.  These beans are legit. Not soupy can junk. It's full of meat and smokey flavor with a good bite of heat for good measure.  I adore the coleslaw. It's mesquite slaw I believe. Real creamy with a smokey spice and added corn. Coleslaw will never be the same after theirs. Their salads are pretty good, nice mix of greens and a round pickled pepper. No clue what it is but it's so delicious and sweet.  They offer banana pudding or strawberry shortcake for dessert...but I'm an odd duck. Their homemade pickles are so good they count for dessert with me. I've asked for just an extra side of pickles and they've filled a side dish up no charge.  It's not just the food that is great. I've always have had above and beyond customer service here. I am always leaving with a huge smile on my face from just the good vibes I get. I always leave an extra tip even if I'm doing take out just because they take care of you. And they always thank you for it. No, you don't have to thank me when you so very much deserve it.  So if you're a local, don't forget to show your id for your discount. It's a really good discount! And try to make it on taco Tuesday. Those looked real tasty.  They offer inside and outdoor dining. It's pretty noisy inside.  Parking is free but can be hard to g get a spot at times...and no one seems to know how to park by pulling up to the front line. Makes it tight to maneuver at times. Also if you keep your receipt from the candy store you can get a discount at the bbq if you don't get the local discount.  All in all this place is a credit to Vegas. It's not a mediocre celebrity joint..its legit good grub.",

If a tourist without a rental asked about a BBQ spot located near public transportation, I'd recommend this place, but I don't necessarily see myself going back here again. The customer service was great, everyone was very friendly and helpful but if I can make any complaint it'd be that the restaurant was SO COLD, so freakin cold, that my food was only hot for about five minutes and then it tasted like I was eating leftovers from my fridge.  Update: After attending the Knights game last week at T-Mobile Arena and eating Rollin' Smoke while watching the game, my tune has changed and I'm a fan!!! We got two sandwiches: one pulled chicken and the other maybe a chipped beef , and it was AMAZING! We had a variety of sauces and my tastebuds we're dancing!!!

The burnt ends are amazing..The mac & cheese is to die for so happy to have come across this place ..can't wait to bring the wife back here for dinner  The bartending staff was amazing definitely going to become a regular here . I will be writing another review once I try a lot more the food on the menu..my recommendations are the ribs burnt ends and finger licking chicken I'm out the door now so when I said to do it",

The price is pretty pricey if you're going to get a meal, a side, and a beer, so you might as well do the unlimited package!  The only negative is that it sometimes can take a while to get your beer because the insist on bringing it out to you.  Also, important to note that locals get 20% off! Makes their prices a lot more reasonable, IMO.",

This location seriously touristy.  It is set up for the fans of the Pawn Stars show.  That is not why I came here as I wanted some BBQ to take home.     As it was slow the guys running the place told me I would have to go upstairs to the bar to order.  After realizing I had no idea where the bar was they let me order with them.  I got to give them a shout out for being cool about that.     I order 3 dinners to take home and the guy ringing me up asked if I was a local and once I told him yes he adds - cool we give locals 20% off!  I ordered two pulled pork and chopped brisket and one chopped brisket and spicy sausage.   I also ordered the chipotle slaw, potato salad and spicy macaroni and cheese.  All were good with the spicy macaroni and cheese being the standout.  It definitely was spicy but not overpowering.     Their BBQ is tasty with good smoke flavor.  The pulled pork was my favorite with the spicy sausage being a close second.  I did like the brisket but not a fan of having it chopped up.  Their BBQ sauce is Sweet with a slight tang which I really enjoyed.    I did truly enjoy the BBQ but wish it came with more BBQ sauce, the brisket wasn't chopped and they didn't put the bread in the bottom of the container with the BBQ put on top.  Small things I will get differently on my next visit.",

For example he said the menu is here on the glass. Some of my family where still looking on there menu board. He literally yelled \" don't look up there i already said this is our menu here on the glass. If I was a graphic designer I would change it. Boy if you were a graphic designer you wouldn't be make 8$ an hour serving tourists overpriced BBQ. The reason they don't want you looking at the original menu board is because they show how much they raised the prices on everything. The only reason I gave 2 stars is because the big Hispanic guy from Wilmington Ca was really cool.",

Pork rack of ribs smothered in smokey, spicy n sweet bbq sauce! Hmm Mmmm good! Juicy, fall off the bone & delicious! This joint is inside right off of a street in downtown but once you dig in you feel like you're somewhere in Texas out on a ranch outside having an outdoor bbq. The wood benches and decor of the restaurant really helps with that imagination. The cornbread oh my! So good I could eat some everyday!  The Mac and cheese, the smokey baked beans everything is just so good.  A bit pricey but so worth it and the staff is so friendly and inviting! I forgot his name but the Asian guy behind the counter is always there when we come at night and we go a lot. He's great, awesome service and welcoming ambience!

    "text": "Ribs platter $24.99 was recommended for 2 but really it was barely enough for one person. It came with 1 side + 2 each of St. Louis, baby back and beef ribs. Isn't bad, all of them fell off the bone, juicy, tender but was it lacked flavour big time. It had a bit of smoky taste but because there wasn't much seasoning, it was a big disappointment. There were some hot sauce to dip them in but I was looking for sticky bbq sauce slathered over them.",

    "text": "Came here a few months ago for a casual birthday dinner of 4 people. The prices are reasonable to begin with, but the locals discount brought the bill down to only $80 (with 2 alcoholic drinks!) The food was awesome for the price, and I would highly recommend the baked potato. Everyone cleaned their plate to the last crumb. We sat upstairs at the bar, and the atmosphere was awesome. The bartender was polite and helpful, and the establishment itself was clean and well kept. There is also balcony seating on the second floor, which is nice if it's a beautiful day out! The location is convenient and there is a good amount of parking. Overall I would recommend this restaurant to someone looking for great barbecue food at a great price.",

    "text": "So the only other time I was here was when they first opened and they did not have a full menu. I guess this is my first True visit. I must admit I'm sorry I've been missing out especially since I live less than half a block away. So, today I ventured to try three things. First I tried the pulled pork sandwich. The pulled pork was delicious and cooked to perfection. The spicy sauce which didn't drown the sandwich but gave it a great taste. I would say defiantly a must. Then I ventured to the stuffed potato with the burnt tip brisket. The brisket was delicious. Unfortunately the potato fell way short of what a baked potato should be. I would probably not recommend the stuffed potato. Just order the brisket on it's own or as a combo or sandwich. Then we move on to the side of smoked mac and cheese.  Can I just say deliciousness in your mouth that you savor each bit!  Based on how disappointed I was with the baked potato I gave them one less star. Yes, that bad that I felt it took away from enjoying the brisket.  Overall a must try and they do have a full bar upstairs.   I will say the reason I kept it ring off going here is because I didn't want o walk out smelling like a bbq pit. I came home and had to shower to get the smell out of my hair so don't go here if you plan to go out after unless you enjoy smelling like smoked human.   The food is great and I will be back.... well only when I know I'm going directly home afterwards. Lol  Enjoy!",

    "text": "I hate to give this place 4 stars because the bartender upstairs taking care of us was so awesome and attentive but not overbearing. She was super nice and constantly checked on us to make sure we were doing okay! But the food was just not there for me. Between myself and 4 friends, everything we got seemed to have a similar \"kick\". There was a spice that really made everything hot and it was literally on all the food, from Mac and cheese and mashed potatoes to ribs, sandwiches, and even a salad; all of our mouthes were burning! Through the spice you could taste how good the food was but right when you stared to enjoy the bite you took, your mouth was assaulted by another punch of spice. Also, I felt like the menu was very repetitive, I know it's a BBQ place but it felt like your only option was some kind of pork in BBQ sauce or super corny typical BBQ food. I would love to have seen some different types of food done BBQ style or new concoctions made with random types of food. Or I don't know maybe I'm crazy and I never knew I just don't like BBQ food. Either way, the atmosphere is really fun, the people that work there are really really awesome, but between myself and friends, none of us liked our food and definitely wouldn't recommend it. Maybe come for drinks and a good hangout spot but either skip the food or be very very clear that you don't want anything to have any kind of spice in it and see if they have anything off the menu that's not sooooo overdone traditional BBQ.",

Always have the best customer experience here! Everyone is just so nice! And the food is the bomb what more do you need??   One thing I don't like about this particular location though is that Rick from pawn star is co-owner of this place and he bartends here on the weekend! But they are kinda an asshole when they are around! They make it seems like he's Mr.President or something! Lots of cussing, super annoying loud music and lots of yelling between them so we don't usually come on weekends night! Just a little too much at times!   But other than that! Food is excellent! Might wanna try their other location in town on weekends! It's just call Rollling BBQ! Seriously best BBQ in town!!!",

    "text": "Grab a beverage, they serve them here, this is going to take a moment of your time.   We moved to Vegas from Tucson. A treasure of the ol'Pueblo is Lil Abners Steak house. You want Beef Ribs in Tucson you go there. So when we moved here we assumed like EVERYTHING else in life, your vice can be found in Fabulous Las Vegas. Whatever you want, it's here, and in no fewer than three locations. No kidding. Search for it in Yelp.   Everything except Beef Ribs.   I've been on a deliberate search for acceptable (I'm managing expectations) beef ribs. I enjoy them, but they are also crucial to my homemade beef rib hash.   I won't embarrass the other establishments which apply heat to various cuts of bovine and then call it \"barbecue\" or \"beef ribs\" but I almost gave up. Until I walked here.   At the price Rick's was quoting, I figured it was a tourist trap and they only thing smothered in sauce was more disappointment.   I walked in, and asked the gentleman behind the counter if they had beef ribs.   Matt said \"yep, and it's $XX.xx per rib\"  Me: What do they look like  Matt: like a beef rib   Me: ...  Matt: Just kidding   Matt then revealed the goods... to say it was love at first sight is a bit of an over statement, however, Matt asked what I was doing with the beef, I told him I was making hash. Matt inquired as to how many folks I would be serving, to which I replied... four.   Matt then asked if I would like him to debone the ribs and chop it for my hash. I said, yes, if it wasn't too much trouble.   In one motion, Matt simply pulled the bone from the ribs, this was the moment I knew I was in love and this was my place.   To wrap this up, the ribs were amazing, and made my hash the greatest of all time. Sorry hash house whoever.   Attached are pictures of the finished dish.",

When there are awards prominently placed in an establishment, that catches my attention!  I need to investigate!  There were 5 adults and 1 child.  We ordered 2 three choice meats/ with 3 choices of sides to share.  We had leftovers.  My sons could not stop raving about the pulled pork.  That was some of the best pulled pork I've ever tasted too.  There were 3 guys working that day.  All of them were friendly and helpful.  When we visit Vegas, this will probably be a place we'll come to visit.",

I ate the Monday special Big Hawg, and it was a big BBQ sandwich with lots of coleslaw. I'd loved the sandwich and highly recommend. The side of baked beans was spot on for sure, and had a little kick but not to hot for me. I like it hot so I added the spicy BBQ sauce which made it perfect. The burnt ends and pork made these beans top notch!   I had the strawberry shortcake, because it was made with cornbread instead of angel food cake. I was curious and I really like the strawberry shortcake and the portion was large.   I hope to be back soon and highly recommend!   I toured the pawn shop next door and worth the look for sure",

The ribs are better than the brisket, which is better than the pulled pork, but that doesn't mean any of it is good. It's kind of Texas style, except for that they use green onions and there's no jalapeno. The mac and slaw are okay, but neither is quite southern (and who put corn in my slaw?)   I suppose the regional BBQ clusterf*ck in a place afflicted by its own cultural malaise makes sense, but take a hint from the strip and just pick a theme, y'all (outside of reality TV about second-hand resale.)",

I live in Wichita Kansas and a dinner like this would come in at 1/2 this price. Where  I'm from an all you can eat  barbecue buffet would cause $19.50.  Here it's an outrageous $40 for all you can eat in one hour.  Now that you know it's extremely overpriced let's talk about the quality.  The brisket and pulled pork were both extremely dry. The taste was ok but certainly nothing for bragging rights.  The hot link was good.  The sauces were good.  The Arkansauce had a little bit of kick to it.   I preferred the Sweet Mama sauce.  You will need lots of it for the dry meat. The macaroni and cheese was tasty but certainly not addictive.  The service was friendly. The building was what you would expect of a typical barbecue restaurant.  This restaurant would not be in the running for the best in Wichita Kansas.  In fact the price alone for most barbecue restaurants would put this one out of business.",

I chose Pulled Pork and Chopped Brisket with Collard Greens and Piggy Chips (Chicharron). The Greens were an extra side. The Brisket had good flavor but found it to be too chopped. It was almost like ground beef. If they were chopped in small cubes, that would've bern perfect. The Pulled Pork was on point. Super tender and falling apart. The Collard Greens were pretty basic. Nothing too special but complimented the meats well. The Chicharron was Chicharron. I can't find anything bad to say about Chicharron.

    "text": "Went into the barbecue restaurant on the first floor for dinner. Had the platter that included smoked chicken, brisket (ordered it sliced), ribs, hot links and three sides.  The portions were large as was the price: $35.00, but I wanted to sample what they had to offer since barbecue is one of my favorites.  The chicken was OK, but lacked a lot of smoked flavor.  The brisket was juicy and cooked perfectly but had virtually no smoked flavor at all.  The hot likes were just OK.  Probably the best meats were the ribs, although they were far from the best I have had.  The sides, collard greens, cold slaw, and potato salad were about average.  All in all, the barbecue was OK, but pricey.  And $5.00 for a fountain soda?    After dinner we went upstairs to the tavern were Rick was tending bar with Antoine from Pawn Stars as the MC.  They also had a DJ in the tavern.  Interestingly enough, the drink prices were better than the food prices.  A nice feature of the tavern was that you could order off the menu of the barbecue restaurant.  The tavern had a nice beer selection, and Rick and Antoine certainly put on a show at the tavern. As it turns out, Antoine can be quite the comedian.  Who knew?",

    "text": "Apparently we showed up at the right time because parking was a breeze. We were able to park for free in a spot or we could literally view our vehicle the whole time we dined and drank. For those of you that have stopped at little spots like this on the Strip you know how rare that really is. We had my son 5 years old and my daughter 3 years old and toe with us and we're concerned if they would be allowed in the establishment or would enjoy it themselves. We found our concerns to be unfounded as we were seated at a table on a balcony facing the strip. I don't remember the exact name of the dish we ordered but it was some kind of pit special including pulked pork, ribs, brisket, chicken, hot links, and three sides. They allow you to sub out one meat for another so we decided to forego the links for more brisket, not sure what we missed with the links but the brisket was certainly hard to top. We ordered a draft beer and a shot of Crown Royal and we're amazed to find that the beer was only $5 in the shot only 4. Also my wife found it necessary to mention that the soda back she got was a full soda and not just a little Ramekin cup that you find at some other places. I was already pleased with the food quality service and pricing but was even happier to find out that there's a local discount at this place which took $11 off of our bill. If you are looking for great barbecue not to spend a ton of money possibly see a celebrity and just relax and enjoy a slightly less busy part of the strip I can't say enough good things about this place. Wait I can say one more great thing amazing beer selection as a craft kind of sore I find a lot of places have the same 3 non Basic beers over and over again this place had I want to say like 14 tabs and a bunch of other stuff in cans and bottles. Even after all that great stuff the highlight was the amazing service from the bartender I should have got his name I'm new to this Yelp thing long haired white dude dark hair for what that's worth couldn't have been better and more cordial and professional!",

The inside of the take-out restaurant was much colder than most establishments. I ordered a pulled pork sandwich for $13 and my friend ordered the \"biggin\" sandwich (brisket, pulled pork, & hotlink) for $16. All the meat and rolls were served COLD. They didn't even hide the fact that they took the meat and rolls directly from the refrigerator. The BBQ sauce on top was the only thing heating the meat. Huh?? The $8 side of \"loaded potato\" was a small cup of instant mashed potatoes with some cheese and bacon bits on top. The man serving us said he gave me extra meat on my sandwich, but it looked like the appropriate amount for the roll; not anything over-the-top. I am a petite woman and was STARVING after eating this cold meat. Outrageous for the price. Definitely would not return. Tourist trap.",

I scoped out the eating choices and decided on this one. I didn't even realize there was an upstairs area and I had a stroller so this was good for me. I ordered a salad, after sampling the meat decided on the pulled pork. For the sauce I went a little spicy and more sweet, it also comes with a side of ranch. Luckily there portions aren't skimpy on the ranch.   The salad was $12 and the drink was $5. A little steep for a lunch meal, but the flavor did make me feel I got my money's worth.  The salad is delicious. Plenty of meat and so tender and the flavor is great. Soon my family came in to check on me and were eating the salad raving about it as well. Before we left a large group of tourists came through and received a sample of the meat as they passed. They looked to be part of a tour.  Some of the employees are friendly and others aren't so much, luck of the draw I suppose. Definitely check this place out if you're in the area!",

Opted for the smoked chicken and cornbread, with sweet tea. That chicken had a wonderful taste. But that Boss sauce tho was the MVP. They have several sauces you can try and enjoy.   Each day has a daily special for a great price. Prices are a reflection of the Vegas Tourist Scene. With that being said if you have a locals ID your meal is 20% off, and the bar upstairs is always happy hour for locals.   Interior is family style seating in the middle, or counter- seating along the wall. There is a few outlets with USB ports for charging those phones.

    "text": "After reading several reviews that mentioned and bragged upon the Bloody Mary they serve here I bet you can guess what we ordered. And as with others Holy Crap it was good, very filling, and amazingly cost effective. Served with 2 baby back ribs on top of the glass supporting a pulled pork slider it's a drink and meal rolled into one. More, or equally impressive was how over the top nice the whole staff was. It's a 2 story affair and the folks downstairs pointed out that there was a more extensive menu upstairs PLUS that was where the bar is located  If a fun space and assembled out of shipping containers with excellent acoustics, lighting and festive wall hangings. I was really pleasantly surprised and would gladly go back again. In fact my dinner guest lives within walking distance of the place, had never heard of it before and clearly plans on going back again very soon.",

My boyfriend got the brisket and 2 sides. Both were amazing. Totally wish there was one in Ohio. Staff was super friendly and accommodating. Highly recommend to anyone to those who love BBQ (and those who don't! ;p ).",

Pulled pork = Co-worker said it was too spicy (even with no sauce) for her. Would not even eat it.  Mac and cheese = Co-worker said it had tons of pepper in it.  Would not even eat it.   Spicy sausage = The sausage was dried up and tough like it was cooked hours ago.   Loaded mashed potatoes = \"Sorry we ran out.\"  Loaded baked potato = \"Sorry we ran out.\"  Cornbread = Was OK.  Collard greens = Was OK.  Prices were high for what you get.  Portions were small, very small.   Sorry Rick, I love you guys ... but I think we're going to stick to Memphis Championship BBQ.",

Get out of the restaurant business. I am not going to explain all of the nuances it takes to be successful in the restaurant business. You don't have the capacity or the time to learn them. Again do what you do best. I give you 2 more years in the BBQ business. Cut your losses! I know your sucking wind on this investment. Getting out early will be the least painful thing you can do.",

Mark the bartender greeted us right away and we told him we wanted munchies food and immediately knew what would satisfy us. So we ordered burnt end sliders and smoked mac and cheese on his recommendation. Exactly what we wanted!!! The cole slaw on the sliders didn't have a ton of mayo so it was just perfect for the sliders. And locals get a discount here!!! Karaoke on Tuesday's and comedy show on weds. And sometimes Rick from Pawn Stars guest bartends here. If you are hanging out on Fremont and want a great BBQ spot to beat the heat at this place is it!! And I get a free \"mystery shot\" for writing this!! So glad we found this place",

They have a BBQ sauce for everyone's liking! We got the mac n cheese , mashed potatoes and corn bread as sides and they were all great choices! Our favorite drink was the porch swing!

I love coming here after my downtown adventures for my sandwich and a PBR.   Their food is definitely fairly priced because you're getting the brand & the quality. The guys here are always so nice and helpful when I'm being indecisive. Their other sides are super delicious and they have a great beer selection as well.

The drafts are $7 and he's got a great selection - I quaffed down a couple of the Rogue Dead Guy Ales and the wifey had the Hop Nuts Porter. We also had split a rack of huge baby back ribs which were pretty good considering we're from Kansas City (home of the best BBQ ribs in the world). Rick's also has some cool stuff from the shop on the wall and the breeze coming in on the top deck makes it a comfortable place to have a drink. Folks also spark up conversations quickly and we always enjoy our time there",

The employee was super nice, we told him it was our first time and he recommended the \"pit special\"  5 meats 3 sides for $27.99. 2 spare ribs, chicken, pulled pork, hot links, and brisket.

The bbq sauce options were South Carolina Mustard, Eastern  NC vinegar, and a more Kansas City tomato based sauce which comes either spicy or sweet. I opted for the sweet, but my husband chose Eastern NC and we were both happy. There  are great sides available. I had slaw which was slightly  spicy, but still a nice cool counterpoint  to the rich pork. The baked beans were incredible. Unlike  other baked beans, these backed beans had small chunks of meat, not fat, in them. The sauce was redolent  with onions and a thick flavorful  tomato  sauce. The was great looking cornbread, but I did not have any as the potions were so big. There were good-looking  desserts available,  but who had room to eat them?           The restaurant itself is one in which you place your orders at the counter and then sit on stools and eat at the counters that run throughout the restaurant. I think that there is outdoor seating as well, but we sat inside. The Staff is very knowledgeable , upbeat, friendly and positive that they have the best bbq in town. Although I haven't  had other bbq in Vegas, I have eaten my way through the South,  Kansas City and Texas. I know good bbq and this \"Q\" was outstanding, a little pricy, but worth it.      Great opportunity  to enjoy some casual dining.",

Cornbread was on point, mac and cheese was amazing, baked beans would make Bush's jealous and bar service was awesome.  Our bartender Bella was great. We hung afterwards and had some drinks and had a blast. I figured this was an in and out stop.  Well, 3 hours later, still here with Bella getting VIP treatment.

For our sides, we chose collard greens, coleslaw, and dirty rice. We were underwhelmed, as another Yelper stated. The chicken was ok, lightly dry seasoned, and the pulled pork was good with a nice smoke. However, the brisket was minced and greasy. It had the look and texture of cat food. Hot links tasted and had the texture of processed gas station pepperoni sticks.  Spare ribs were just okay, I've had better at Memphis or even Lucille's. As for the sides, the coleslaw was my favorite, was not heavily dressed and had a bit of kick because of the chipotle. Dirty rice was a bit too salty, and the collared greens, were just okay. I'd like to say that I would come back, but I probably won't.",

I think the bartender was Matt but he was the best, great service, great food and we came back later that day because Matt said that Rick Harrison from pawn stars show was bartending. We got to talk to him and get a photo!! I had the pulled pork sandwich and my wife had the ribs. There was great beer from local breweries which is always good to taste new things and they were happy enough to let me taste the beer before buying a whole pint! The bar is a bit small but very comfortable, and there is an outside patio overlooking the pawn shop. Overall 10/10!",

    "text": "Came in on a chilly Sunday night in November looking for nothing more than to check out the new container park-like shopping/eating plaza that popped up next to Gold and Silver Pawn Shop.  Started at poutine place downstairs but wasn't interested in sitting outside and wanted a bar to go with my gravy smothered fries. Turns out the place is totally cooperative- guy at poutine place told us it was fine to take his food upstairs to the BBQ place/bar.   The place was totally dead in a way that plagues any outdoor mall on a cold Vegas night. We were the only bar patrons aside from the security guy from the pawn shop. This afforded us a private (pretty much) bartender who was super chatty and personable and told us that locals get 20% off (hello!). He was very helpful with suggestions of food and beer.   Things to consider- BBQ was good and I appreciate the fact that it wasn't smothered in sauce, one of rare times where brisket outdid the rib tips in flavor. Awesome brisket, great job, guys, usually brisket falls short when compared to rib tips because fat is delicious. This is the only time I have been to a BBQ spot where brisket was as delicate and flavorful as this. That said, rib tips reminded me of a pot roast. I truly think it's because meat wasn't very fatty- quality- just a bit off from what I'm used to with rib tips.   Beer- it's almost impossible to find a bar that has s good selection of hef on tap that isn't fruit/vanilla flavored. For the love of God, hef lovers like me just want a plain delicious full bodied hef that doesn't taste like a syrup.   Lastly- it wasn't a whole lot of food for $20. Don't come in here expecting to fill up and then some.  It's good, it's pretty cool, just isn't the best value.",

Food was ok, woulda been better if it was actually hot. (Go to the real ROLLIN Smoke BBQ on highland for better experience). As we made our way to his bar, we were exited to see him, but as we got closer to him he didn't seem too thrilled about the customers in his establishment. All we wanted was a picture with him. He had to ask his bodyguard to see if it was ok. As Rick chain puffed on his cigarette, we ordered a drink and chatted thinking he might stroll by and check on his customers, NOPE. Part of owning a business is customer service. You gotta bend over backwards to customers so they keep coming back. You are the name of this plaza and I sure as heck didn't feel appreciated the night I drove up to your place. This place is nothing special, Rick is. I thing special. He's just a name, he lost his heart & soul a few years back. I was a fan of him, his show, and how he conducted business BUT now he's a shadow getting walked all over and spit on.",

    "text": "Finally all you tourists that just gotta check out the pawn shop can have some pretty good barbeque here. Now I dont know how Rick Harrison ended up with his name being included in the title but I can only guess when your barbeque is damn good you tend to gain some notariety. That and you were offered a spot in their new plaza-like setting. I guess its a win-win for both parties.  Now for the food. I gave the original Rollin Smoke location 5 stars. Why? Because its a stone's throw away from Spearmint Rhino! Ok, maybe that shouldnt qualify but hay, making it rain does make one hungry so hoppin on over to RS should be a no brainer.   Sorry to stray off the main subject there, as a guy, I tend to get easily distracted and strip clubs tend to be one of them. Unlike the original location, this new place does not serve beef ribs at the moment. The beef ribs are mainly the number one reason I go to RS because I havnt had anything like them anywhere. Here it is a limited menu. The prices seem to be marked up as well but that should be expected since they are technically on the strip still.   What I ended up getting was the 2 meat combo ($19.99) which comes with a side and a drink. Your meat choices are pulled pork, beef hot links, chopped brisket, smoked chicken, or st louis ribs. Your side choices are bbq baked beans, cole slaw, mashed potatos, and mac n cheese. I chose chopped brisket and st louis ribs. As usual both meats were on point. The brisket was a little bit greasy this time around but still good. The ribs were tender and fall off the bone smoke flavored goodness! Mac n cheese was just ok.  Some random useful info: When you order your meats, they will ask you if you want sweet barbeque sauce on it or on the side. They also have a spicy and a really spicy barbeque sauce but you have to ask for it. On the tables they have their standard barbeque sauce. They also have wall outlets everywhere for your convenience so you can charge your phone or laptop. Just like the beef ribs, they told me that they dont have wifi for now as well. There are tables outside. Locals get 20 percent off their order. Hours are 10 am to 10 pm everyday. There is a bar right above where they serve appetizers and alcoholic beverages.  In closing, I dont understand why you would have a limited menu when this location is gonna breed surefire success. I would rather have you not open just yet in order to make it right with a complete menu. You cannot deny the people their beef ribs, outlaw burger, and smoked meatloaf not to mention fried catfish, more sides, and dessert. The marked up prices def will take advantage of you out of towners.  Yelp 2015 Review #70 \"Rollin Smoke aint no joke!\" 568 overall",

The food will be decent, but its not as good as the other locations. It is more expensive, and quite frankly, you get less food. I am a local and eat Rolling Smoke A-LOT. My favorite one being on highland. They happened to be out of brisket, so I came to this Rollin Smoke. No corn nuggets (bro, get a fryer) and some of the smallest portions I have ever seen. You fit my 2 bbq sauces and my side (which is in its own container) in the same container as my 3 meat combo. How is this possible?? None of the other Rolling Smokes do this. You get loaded with meat (especially a 3 meat combo) at the other locations and sides are in the bag. (my order was to go).  Got a local discount and this still came to $48.  Extremely disappointed when I got home with the lack of food.   2 stars because the people were nice, and it tastes like Rolling Smoke.",

Complete dead at around 9pm. Okay, fine. We shouldn't be that surprised it's not NYC and it's about a mile from the main part of the strip.   The food though? All the food came out luke warm at best. Brisket was extremely overcooked. Ribs were just okay, but again you could totally tell that it wasn't fresh. At least, heat up the food all the damn way. Mac and cheese was meh. By the end of the meal, everything was completely cold.   Very disappointing. Very, very disappointing.",

    "text": "So a little backstory, I'm from the south and have eaten BBQ from all over the country and this was mediocre at best. Have heard nothing but good things from friends and went here with high expectations and it was a let down. I got the 3 meat sampler, baby back ribs, sliced brisket, and pulled pork with a side of the smoked Mac n Cheese. First thing I noticed before sitting was how many different sauces they have. It's nice to have variety but with good bbq you only need like 1-2 sauces to compliment the meat, 1 sweet and 1 spicy. If you have good bbq don't try and hide behind having different sauces. Now to start with the ribs. They were just meh. They were pretty dry and tough. I had to really bite through to get the meat off which tells me they smoke at too high of a temp instead of the meat falling off the bone. Now the brisket was the same, really dry not tender at all, and they cut with the grain of the meat vs against which would probably help it be more tender. Makes sense why they have all the sauces now, meat is dry and needs it. Now the pulled pork, honestly it was really juicy and had good flavor, would recommend. The Mac N Cheese had WAAAAYYYYY too much pepper and it was top coarse of a grind. I was getting pepper in my teeth and I could literally bite the pepper corns because they were so big.   So to wrap this up, they need some improvement before they call themselves the \"Best BBQ in Vegas\" because I can think of 3 places right now that beat them in every single area. If this place didn't have Rick's name on it, then it probably wouldn't be around as long as it has.",

Since this is a secondary location you won't find the full menu available at the original location. You will find all of the meats, but they are for purchase by the pound instead of as part of a meal. The sides offered are a condensed listing, but there are still great options available. This location is set up more for sharing than for individual meals. This was fine since my husband and I wanted to share as part of our food crawl that day.  We had the half a rack of St. Louis style ribs and a side of Bacon Potato Salad. Yum on both. The ribs were smoky, meaty, and tender. I love the traditional sauce on the ribs. The potato salad has a great flavor and plenty of bacon.   The staff is very friendly and welcoming. Service is definitely top notch here. Locals get 20% off of this great BBQ as well.",

Not much of a sauce person but both offering were good. Staff was very helpful and nice. Only thing that was just OK was was the banana pudding. Would definitely recommend and go back when in town.

But given the product that they produce It is Well above what they should be charging. I have had better BBQ from Arby's then I got at this place for double the price. Their pulled pork was Bland and tasteless the brisket left a lot to be desired the hot link was okay but the outer casing was difficult to chew digestion swallow and the bread was hard not stale but clearly getting there. The meal itself was under sized and the drinks were outrageously overpriced and I don't mean the alcoholic drinks I mean every drink on the menu even water was overpriced. The venue in which it was served lacked any sense of aesthetic charm the chef was very stingy with the sauce and the person at the counter had no idea what they were doing. I don't know what I expected from this place given who owns it. But I can tell you one thing I will not be returning here and I strongly suggest everybody else do the same because it is not worth it like I said I have gotten better barbecue from Arby's and Applebee's at half the price or less. This place is in a sense one giant rip off.",

The prices are a big high, but for BBQ this good, it's definitely worth it. I had the Duo Combo with burnt ends brisket, pulled pork, potato salad, and for an extra $5 I got beef ribs.

    "text": "Rick's Rollin Smoke BBQ & Tavern (what a mouthful!) is a cute bar that serves pretty good lookin' food!  It's owned by Rick Harrison, one of the owners of the Gold and Silver Pawn Shop across the parking lot and star of the tv show Pawn Stars.  We learned Rick was going to be bartending one night while we were in Vegas so we headed to the bar hoping to meet him (and get a book signed).  We saw him (and his bodyguard) head up the stairs to the bar right on time at 8pm.  We headed up afterward and found a seat at the bar.  There's also a few tables around the bar and outside on a veranda - but it's a pretty small establishment.  Rick was behind the bar pouring himself shots!  He looked a little nervous and out of his element, which I found endearing.  He made conversation with people at the bar and when I asked him for Long Island Ice Teas - he deferred to the real bartender, lol!  Our drinks were strong, no joke!  I did see him pouring some beers for other customers though.  One of the servers walked around with merchandise like hats and shirts which Rick would sign if you bought.  He did come over and sign the book but after we were there for about 30 minutes, it started to get pretty packed and he was being approached for photos and the like.  We accomplished what we came for so we relinquished our bar seats and headed to our next stop.  I did see some baked potatoes being served that were giant and completely legit!  They advertise on a sign outside when Rick is bartending and you can also ask at the pawn shop!",

    "text": "Good ribs and brisket. Sauce could be spicier but is not sweet. Sweet is also offered for those who don't  know any better.  Potato salad is different but tasty. Sides are plentiful but priced a notch up. I think prices include tax. Nice discount for locals. Will go back much to regret of scales.",

    "text": "Visiting from Cincinnati Ohio and just had to check out the Famous Pawn Stars Place. Discovered Rick Harrison opened up a BBQ joint right next door. We already ate, so we didn't try the food. Decided to go for a beverage at the upstairs tavern to check it out. So glad we did. First impression Awsome rustic decor We were greeted immediately and promply served. Kelli was tending bar and let me just say... SHE ROCKS!!! And not being much of a gambler myself I liked there wasn't video poker and slots everywhere.The place had the inviting atmosphere of a local neighborhood hang out back home.We stayed for while and had a blast, met some great people.. Will be going back to try the food before heading back home.. Stay tuned for that review.",

    "text": "Ordered a pound of brisket, baked beans and chipotle slaw--the food was wonderful and the employees were very helpful and fun.  The place is set up a little like Chipotle Restaurant where it is cafeteria style.  You pick your meat, pulled pork, beef hot links, pulled chicken or chopped brisket.  You can eat it with or without bread--they will make a sandwich, give you small rolls to make sliders or just eat the meat.  Baked beans, Mac and Cheese, Chipotle slaw and bacon potato salad.  They give generous portions and the food is good.  We will definitely return for BBQ again.",

This place is a hidden gem and we loved it! The meat is smoked very nicely, the sides are very good (love the potato salad) and the desserts are yummy (we loved the banana pudding). Highly recommend this place!",
