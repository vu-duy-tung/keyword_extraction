Settled on one of the HH drink specials-a $3 mug of Batch 19 Pre-Prohibition lager.  We sat inside, watched the pool frolickers and I breathed a sigh of relief to see that our drinks were not served in mason jars-they were used for jelly jar lighting instead-insert sigh of relief here-and I could  just get back to singing along with the Arctic Monkeys with my inside voice.   Soon after we were seated came a whole table of douchery, worse, a hoard of excessively drunk and loud douchery lead by a extremely loud douchebaguette.  Fortunately, she didn't have the moves like Jagger, nor the constitution like Richards and vanished (most likely to the nearest restroom) for the majority of our stay.  All our niblies ( which turned out to be a vast amount of food) were expertly served by Devon:  Pretzel Bites with Provolone Fondue-totally delish carb and cheese goodness  Grilled Cheese Sliders-a bit uneventful  Meatloaf Sandwich-too muted and bland  House Potato Chips & Onion dip-succinctly tasty   Would definitely return to try their main menu.",

Ordered bread with oil and vinegar... which apparently you have to pay now. It took 20 minutes to come out and I had to remind the bartender to go get it. Not worth the wait or $. Asked the bartender how many \"steak tacos\" came with the entree. He said 4. I thought, 'that sounds filling'. 40 minutes later they brought out 3 tiny tacos, each with a few charred pieces of mystery meat and way over-seasoned with some spicy cayenne powder mix or something, and a little pile of sweet pickled slaw? I had to ask for a napkin and silverware half way through my meal because they never brought me one. The food was not good and didn't satisfy my hunger. Just left me with an unpleasant spicy aftertaste and thinking 'I'm gonna regret this choice tomorrow'. Not to mention the poor service. I thought about asking for the menu again to order something else, but my better judgement told me to cut my losses, pay and go back to my hotel room. After all that, bartender picks up my plate and says \"must've been good!\" No, I was just really hungry, it was mediocre. On the positive side, owner reached out to me to make it right after posting review, so at least they're trying.",

We ordered red sangria -- to die for, the pork belly nachos-- amazing, antipasti and kale salad. Everything was so delicious. The atmosphere was super chill and I like the open and airy layout. It connects to the hard rock pool so you had a nice outdoor view and could hear the music from rehab. The decor was great. Overall we had a great time.

Their food is the best and you get a lot for your money! I've tried many different items on the menu and have never been disappointed. In addition to a fantastic menu, the atmosphere and service is what makes this restaurant a place I choose to frequent. The servers and bartenders are welcoming and super friendly, they really want you to have an awesome experience. Most evenings they have live music playing on stage, Good Day Ole is my fav. CDO is always on the top of my list for places to take visitors from out of town because it's a guarantee that we will enjoy great food/drinks and just have an overall fun time!",

Waitress was friendly and helpful with our order. The sandwich tasted really good but the fried potato chips were cold when served and they are made on-site.  My wife's fried chicken was served burned and everything was lukewarm--chicken and the mashed potatoes.  We complained and (maybe the manager?) an employee apologized profusely and had another chicken plate made immediately.  The second fried chicken plate was a little better--at least it was served hot but we then discovered the real reason the chicken wasn't good is the oil in the fryer must be really old because even though it wasn't burned, the skin was really really dark and had that old oil taste/smell.  We removed the skin and the chicken itself was good.  At least we didn't have to pay for the Fried Chicken dish--thanks to the employee.  (Popeyes & KFC are better for less cost) So good service but bad oil.",

This spot not only offers diverse food choices for any of your cravings ( burgers to seared tuna to jambalaya) but their cocktail program is unreal.

I came in with high expectations because it seemed like a super cool atmosphere with fire pits and good lighting but left annoyed and unsatisfied.   First, they wanted to sit us at some chairs outside that didn't have a table where \"most guests just put their plates on their lap\" I'm sorry but I'm not paying money to have a glorified picnic.   When we did get a table our waiter took foreverrrrr and he was not accommodating to vegetarians AT ALL. Usually restaurants have several options (not just one salad) seeing as people have dietary restrictions. I would have been happy with regular pasta with marina sauce but no.   When we finally got the food, it was luke warm and again, disappointing. When we tried to get our bill, we had to find another waitress because our waiter was MIA.

    "text": "I am in love with the menu at Culinary Drop Out! Any place with a raw seafood bar is a win in my book. Pretty much everyone front of house is attractive and the place hums with a laid back vibe while maintaining a posh yet edgy atmosphere. So why the two star rating?  Everything sounded better on the menu than it actually was- everything just fell short of expectations. The service here was just terrible. The worst service I've had all year, maybe ever. We waited 20 minutes just to see our server for drinks, we waited even longer for water and the coffee that we ordered never got a refill.. Even though it was requested twice. The courses weren't paced at all so I had soup getting cold while a sandwich got soggy and my oysters got warm. Service is a total bust!  Unfortunately the food didn't make up for the bad service.  The cheese fondue which was ordered on the recommendation of our waiter was really a glorified Velveeta. The soft pretzels were good, but really they're just a mode of transportation for the hot melty cheese which arrived at the table with a skin already formed over the top. Really appetizing (sarcasm). Overall, really bland, with no bite. The white shrimp is served with the shell on but cleaned and they were fantastic! Perfectly cooked. Best part of the meal by far! I'd definitely make me way back here for a cocktail and shrimp cocktail if it's not inconvenient. The Kushi oysters which are normally my favorite had a sort of funk, even though it was apparent they were shucked to order. The French Onion Soup was quite possibly the worst I've ever had (and I once unwisely made the mistake of ordering French Onion at Applebees). Bland light colored broth with too much thyme, a round of tough rye bread topped with just a little cheese on top that had been cooked to death. There was no melty stringy cheesy goodness here that you have to wrap around the spoon to maintain a little dignity.. Just a stale crouton witha  crust of hard cheese floating in bland broth. The warm Italian Grinder, also at the recommendation of our server, was nothing special and arrived crisp on the top.. But soggy as all heck on the bottom. This soggy-bottomed sandwich comes with hand cut fries on the side which were the best part of that meal.  Even though the service was so bad and the food so mediocre, I really did fall hard for their menu and will give it another go. I feel like maybe, just maybe, I ordered the wrong items and I got the wrong server, and just went on the wrong day. We couldn't even get our food boxed up and when we did (25 minutes later) it came back with fondue on the side and got my hand all greasy. The worst part of it all was when our waiter finally did come back after his lengthy disappearance and immediately starting clearing away plates, taking away a whole shrimp and oyster. That's $6 worth of deliciousness, man! Always ask before clearing!  Their specialty cocktail menu had a sleuth of amazingly well thought-out libations and that alone is enough to bring me back. The prices are very reasonable for the strip, and if nothing else- go for a drink, the raw bar, and antipasto. You can't screw up Italian cured meats with a top of the line slicer on hand.",

I sat at the bar where I was greeted by Matt the bartender. He was knowledgeable and moved lightening fast making drinks for not only myself but everyone at the bar and in the restaurant.   I ordered the pretzels and cheese dip. Although the pretzels were a bit salty, they were still enjoyable. I also ordered the pulled pork nachos which were on happy hour special...SCORE!!! The pork was tender and juicy. If you love chocolate, ask for the chocolate bottom pie. Nom nom nom.",

First of all the waiter was the bomb, Adorably cute with blue hair and tattoos , huge smiles friendly and attentive. Took the time to explain everything and gave refills or anything we needed in a timely manner. So the service was golden for that it would be five stars.  He suggested the pretzels with fondue, carbs are my enemy so we said no... which we regretted later as everyone else ordered them and they looked really good.  ordered: ( We mixed it up and shared so we can check it all out) Side salad , tasted a little funny to me, it was ok. Chicken noodle soup, had an Asian flair to it. Very unique and not too salty. Fried Chicken comes with mashed, Cole slaw, biscuit . Chicken was super tender. Steak with brussels sprouts potato and mushrooms. The brussels sprouts were so good we ordered extra~!  Didn't have room or time for dessert. A 4 star because soup and or salad should have been included in the price for dinner... But hey I am cheap...;)  A good choice if in the Hard Rock Casino.",

Mind you, I am very understanding, but there were no more than 14 other customers, max, so I couldn't comprehend the long wait.   With that being said, the deviled eggs are delicious!!

    "text": "There wasn't much to do at the Hard Rock on Christmas Eve- the casino was empty, I didn't feel like going over to the strip quite yet, and I didn't want to be the only person at the casino bar.  Well, I ended up being the only one at Culinary Dropout's bar anyway.  Wild berry beer ($7) seemed to be a good choice after a quick Yelp skim- the cute bartender said it was a very smart choice: tastes just like juice but contains 8% alcohol and you don't get all the beer bloat. Yum.  It seemed like the consensus was brunch, which surprised the bartender because he said they didn't usually get many people in for breakfast/brunch. No problem, I wasn't planning on breakfast, anyway. I love my carbs, so pretzel bites and cheese fondue it was.  Not sure the Chimayo [beer] was worth the $12, but you can't put a price on experience.  Halfway through, I really had to go to the bathroom (downside of having a small bladder). There's no restroom inside the restaurant. Cool thing is, they let me walk out without having opened a tab with a credit card or paying.  I came back only to watch some middle-aged guy across from me inhale a hamburger and a Sicilian man next to me down two cups of coffee. By the way, did I mention he works with Manny Pacquiao?  Cute bartender is also a responsible one. After he made me two more drinks, he wanted to make sure I didn't go \"stumbling out\". Thanks, but unfortunately, nothing gets in the way of this girl shopping on the strip. The bill was ridiculously cheap, which I had to make up with a gracious tip.  If anyone discovers a new Mexican/Asian fusion restaurant open on the strip and the co-owner is a young man from Tijuana who moved to Vegas for family, chances are, you're in good hands.",

We had a reservation, but it didn't matter as the place was half empty. Had a boatload of food and mimosas. Got the pretzels to start and OMG they are delicious as is the fondue that comes with them. I went on to the egg sandwich, which was really solid. The kid had the captain crunch French toast, which was great, but very sweet - almost like dessert. Everyone else loved their dishes as well. The service was friendly and efficient.  Second visit - Happy Hour with the hubs. Yippee - those 'to die for' pretzels are on the happy hour menu so you know we ordered them. Also got the antipasto plate which had a nice mix of things. Of course, we enjoyed a few cocktails, from the Happy Hour menu as well. And in the end we were, duh, happy. Once again, great service.  I really dig this place and like the decor. Also, like looking out at the pool and cant' wait to go back when the weather is a little cooler and they open the garage doors.  I just hope this place can make it. It wasn't very busy on either of our visits.",

It's a large space so I can see how if it gets too packed the service might be slower.   Ordered the black mussels, 36hr pork ribs, and turkey pastrami. The black mussels was a huge appetizer and could easily be shared between 2-3 people. It was good and just enough seafood garlic flavor but not too overwhelming. The turkey pastrami came out with fries and pickle and had a savory salty flavor on the bread that went well with the smoked turkey. The ribs were every bit as I expected 36hr pork ribs should taste like. The flavors were so infused in the meat that every bite was tasty. The dish also came with coleslaw and fries so it was nice that each dish had some savory sides to go with it.   I really liked the drinks here though. I had the drunken panda while my bf had the pistols at dawn. The drunken panda had Lucky Buddha lager (and calamansi!) but they only put half in the mixed drink so they give you the rest of the beer in the bottle. It's a good summer drink especially with the cucumber infusion. Shout out to my server (I forgot his name) who suggested it and was super spunky, funny, and a good story teller. Also, is it just me or is it a requirement in this place for their bartenders and servers to be tatted. Because my server had full sleeves and tattoos all the way to his neck. They're all really friendly though so not complaining.   Overall, I thought the food was decent, atmosphere casual with the option of eating out in their patio which had some outdoor games, and the servers were attentive but would suggest coming at a less busy time to get faster service. Would definitely come back for their happy hour to see how the vibe is and see if the food portions are decent for the price and to try their fried chicken!",

    "text": "I attended a fitness expo at the hotel and thought I would have zero options for decent quality, reasonably healthy, or good-tasting food...one of the 3.  I'd been to this hotel several times and had never come here until recently.  My first meal was the GORGONZOLA CHICKEN SALAD ($14 butter lettuce, radicchio, arugula, fennel, smoked almond, tart cherry) and I all but licked my bowl clean.  The ingredients were fresh seeming, it wasn't drowning in dressing, and I savored every bite having lunch after one of my workouts.  My second meal there were the bomb-ass THAI CHILE CHICKEN WINGS ($12 cashew, toasted sesame, cabbage, lime).  The wings were heavily slathered but what they were bathing in was the most interesting concoction of lime and sesame, very intense and very tasty.  Both times my table was approached with the cheeky-cool, hey we're all in Vegas kinda attitude, chill and like, hey, it's too hot for anything but being nice.  I liked it.  The inside if nice and ACed but if you want to hear the bump of Rehab and sit in a warm desert breeze, the outside might be for you.  I would definitely return here and for sure check out their AZ locations.",

He had tons of recommendations and he was honest about menu items.  The food was just okay. We ordered the pretzel bites which I thoroughly enjoyed but the $22 chicken while flakey and tender, lacked seasoning. We also ordered the $14 BBQ pork belly nachos which most individuals would enjoy...I was too excited while ordering and overlooked the \"BBQ\" part. I'm not a fan of mixing BBQ and nachos! Just a personal preference. We also tried the $10 monkey bread and ice cream for dessert. I would have preferred the bread to be a little softer but it was flavorful and served HOT out of the oven.  An enjoyable experience but we won't be returning. Too many other restaurants to try in Vegas!",

The host, bartender and waiter were all so friendly and helpful with answering all our questions.  We started off the meal with the pretzel bites after reading everyone else's reviews and trust me they are DELICIOUS! They are quite filling though so make sure to not get too full off of them.  For entrees we had the French dip and butternut cannelloni. Both were good so no complaints there!    We finished off the meal with the bread pudding which was also tasty. I like that it wasn't too sweet and was great for sharing.   I highly recommend this place! Especially for weekday happy hours or live music on the weekends!",

Came here for happy hour and sat inside due to the 104 degree weather outside. However they have a very cute and cool outdoor area with couches, bistro lightening and corn hole game.  Fall night time I can see myself coming to enjoy the outside part.  We only did happy hour food and really had no reason to go beyond since the pretzels and nachos we ordered were completely satisfying.  Most of our drinks were not on happy hour however we're very tasty and worth the typical $12-$15 vegas prices.  Our server was Sean and he was a delight.  We stayed for 5 hours and during this time had a chance to enjoy some live music... three ladies playing modern hits with their violins.  Pretty cool.  In any case just remember if there is a concert that night there is not happy hour.  Otherwise 110% recommend this place for happy hour!  Cheers.",

Based on my friends recommendation we ordered the pork nachos, the hummus, and the grilled cheese sliders. Honestly for the price it's a good amount of food that you get. The pork nachos are probably the best nachos I've ever had! The pork is so delicious in them and I'm not really a pork person usually. The only thing that I would change is to use real cheese instead of nacho cheese but most people prefer nacho cheese on nachos anyway  My friend ordered a garlic bread starter which was so delicious I was surprised how good bread could be LOL it definitely wasn't even that expensive maybe four or five dollars. The hummus was delicious too, as was the grilled cheese sliders which came with bacon and tomato plus fries!  Only complaint really was that the service was not the best. It was warped tour so it was a little busy but we sat at the bar and the bartender didn't tell us until we tried to get her attention that there were still people sitting there. So we moved farther down the bar where there was more space and she didn't get to us for probably around 15 minutes. The service wasn't that fantastic but being a server I understand that sometimes there are factors that I don't know about. She seem to be the only bartender at the time so I can't hold that against her too much.",

Also, the food was not very tasty.. it was just ok, and definitely not worth the price.   When the bill came there was a mistake and we were charged for two sandwiches when we only ordered one.

Our waiter was kind and patient with our party. Sometimes with this big of a party the service tends to not be its best. We appreciate that! The food was good. The crispy shrimp Caesar salad was a little too saucy for me (might want to ask for sauce on the side).

They have a decent happy hour with $6 appetizers and $3 beers. Regular prices are average strip prices, with specialty cocktails running around $12. They have a very unique cocktail menu and the ones I've tried are really good. You should eat here if you are staying at the Hard Rock.",

Prosciutto deviled eggs were not seasoned with anything besides, what looked like bacon bits. Italian Antipasto salad was pretty good and a nice size portion.  Good service, but music is way too loud and it was so dark I could barely see my menu.  Overall not terrible, but not a place I would think about coming back to.",

I should have known something was up because Mr Lucky's next door had a longer line then this place.   I ordered the Bistro steak medium but it came out well done and my steak was luke warm along with my fries. The food also took FOREVER to come out. From the looks of it I think the reason it took a long time for my dish was because it was just sitting around getting cold. From the time we sat down to finally paying our bill, it took almost two hours. I also ordered the bacon Bloody Mary which was a little spicy for my taste, and that drink finally arrived to me about 20 mins later.   1 star for the friendly staff 1 star for the turkey pastrami hubby ordered who said it was yummy.   -1 for the extremely long wait for our food and drink -2 for the food",

They also have something called a paper bag special where you get a canned beer in a bag for like $2.50 and you just don't know what it is (unless you take it out of the bag, but that's spoiling it!).  The coup de grace here is the pretzels and fondue. It was absolutely amazing and I think I could eat it every day. Perfect bites of pretzels along with blazing hot cheese fondue. There is just nothing wrong to say about it.  I also got a burger one of the times we were there. It was okay, altho not spectacular. I honestly barely remember it a few days later. I just keep thinking about those pretzels...",

Mistakes happen, it's inevitable but what a business does after is proof of a good operation.  Outstanding service, very professional and should be a model for any and all restaurants!

Everyone agreed on the pretzels and the burrata. The salads were only ok and the Brussels sprouts were good but not great. My friend did not like her chicken meatballs although I thought they were ok. I had the fried chicken and I was the envy of the table. It was crispy and very hot when it arrived. I thought it was good but very oily. Back to yardbird for me for fried chicken.  I would come here again and try something else.... And the pretzels.",

Service was great, food was great, Kelley James band was awesome... wish I could say the same for our experience tonight.  Had reservations at 7:45, was promptly seated & then it all went downhill. We weren't even acknowledged by our waiter for 15 minutes.  When our spiky blonde H&M wearing waiter decided to give us the time of day we advised him we were ready to order or drinks & apps & our entree seeing as we were already sitting there for 15 minutes (no care in the world from him)   Food... It turned into an over priced gastropubishh meal.  Had the chips & dip app ($7 for over-fried kettle chips) Mac burger (bun falling apart after each bite) turkey pastrami sandwich (decent) shrimp salad (recommend but still over priced at $15) oh and they are super stingy on the fries!   Now back to our waiter - typically we tip 20% + but I honestly had a very hard time giving him even 10% sorry dude but you possibly gave us the worst service we have experienced in LV.   Culinary Dropout I wish I could love you, I wish I could recommend you, but you simply just aren't a place for repeat customers.  You won't be seeing anymore of our $$$",

I give the place 3 stars due to the fact that for starters, their bar has no blender and the food was good but not exceptional. I liked the atmosphere which had a nice decor, beers ordered in cans are wrapped in brown paper bags, which is pretty cute.   We ordered a bunch of different stuff to share. The shrimps were delicious! They were large and juicy cocktail shrimp. My boyfriend doesn't particulary like shrimp, and he enjoyed them and had a few. I really liked the pretzel and cheese appetizer, I actually couldn't get enough of them.   I didn't order a main dish because I wasn't very hungry, but from the looks of my friend's meals, they deliver generous portions and they said it was \"good.\"  I'd come back if I was in the mood for beer.  One more note, the restuarant has an outdoor area that was closed when my friends and I came. It looks like a nice, cool spot to hang out on a summer night to just hangout with friends. I'd like to come back and hopefully up the rating of this place.",

Not a HUGE (Cheesecake Factory/Grand Luxe-esque) but Vegas appropriately broad selection of dishes.    The space that restaurant consumes makes it feel like a hanger with a dynamic inside-outside transition that shows off the beauty of the HRH pools.  That's where everything went downhill...  The service was Vegas nice, the music was Hard Rock music and despite GnR beginning their residency, I was expecting a larger rush at the CD.    The antipasti which we ordered came approximately 3.5 minutes to my buddy and mine's entrees being served.  All of which were at room temperature...no bueno.  No bueno on a few folds...cured meats at room temperature are very strange (to me) at room temperature.  Add a bistro steak ordered Medium Rare, SERVED Rare, and at room temperature is also distressing, the only reason I didn't send it back was the flavors from the gastrique and Gorgonzola and my supreme hunger level at that time.  My buddy had mixed views of his Pork Cubano.  There were highs and lows, but right now plans for a return visit.",

The Hostess let us know they were closing at 3:30pm to set up for a private event.  No big deal, but a sign, stating this, would have been nice, since other potential guests were turned away after we were seated.  My co-worker ordered the Pub Burger and demolished it.  I ordered a Caesar Salad & added Grilled Steak.  Salad was really good.  Loved the addition of the Kale.  Although I had a ton stuck in my teeth.  :-)  We also ordered Soft Pretzels & Provolone Fondue as well as the House Potato Chips with \"Famous\" Onion Dip.  Both of those apps were really good.  I especially loved the Onion Dip.  It was creamy & bursting with onion flavor.  Service was above average.  Will be back as long as it doesn't get the ax from Richard Branson.",

I got the pretzels & cheese fondue, which was LEGENDARY. Just talking about it makes me want to go back all over again, oh my goodness. I ate the whole thing by myself, I never finish anything when I'm on my own, I always make my husband finish it lol  Then I had the fried chicken dinner dish, it was also really good. I ended up getting the s'mores pudding to go & saving it for breakfast because I'm obsessed with actual s'mores (no wannabe s'mores flavors, please) & I was so satisfied the next day! It started me off just right.   The customer service was nice, locals that work there & are very efficient & courteous. It's a bit dim in there so don't bring your work in, just take a few hours off & enjoy the food, drinks, & people.",

I've never been there late to witness if it's noisy or dark as I've read in the reviews was an issue.    On the drink menu they had bourbon & vodka mules, like a the 'Classic Dropout Mule' is a Moscow Mule, etc.  I asked if they could make my favorite mule a Dark 'N Stormy, basically like a Moscow Mule, but with rum.  Well, it tasted like a sour margarita and rumless.  My friend got a margarita that tasted like the sour mix mostly.  Instead, I was happy that they had Veuve Clicquot by the glass. And even that was flat.  I didn't complain.    We didn't try the most talked about Pretzel Fondue, but I love Pretzel bread!  I always order a 'dijonaise' over cheese when I eat pretzel bread.  I ordered the Turkey Pastrami on pretzel bread with cole slaw and Swiss.  My friend Jeff C. ordered the Grilled Chicken Club.  Overall, not impressive.  I did like the chewy pretzel bread, but it wasn't the best.  We split sandwiches and I'd have to say his Club was better.  Nothing that I would rush back to try again and not even the service.  I am not sure if the menu is different at night or on the weekends.  I don't frequent Hard Rock anymore so wouldn't go out of my way for it.",

    "text": "DROPOUT FOR A REASON... (3.25 stars)  Well, one needs to re-enroll and learn how to plate dishes.  After several rounds of slots at the Hard Rock cafe, we came to Culinary Dropout to get something to eat. It wasn't our first choice or a priority, it was a place that came to mind last minute. I'll be honest, I didn't have any expectation. When we entered the restaurant it was pretty empty. I'd expect a little more of a crowd knowing ReHab is just around the corner. What I noticed was the minimal selection on the menu, nothing caught my eye. With no appetite and no prior research of \"what should I order\", I picked something quick and simple off the menu. Our table had fried chicken (heard it was good - didn't taste it), french toast (took a bite, pretty good!), and my order....  THAI CHILE CHICKEN WINGS - cashew, toasted sesame, cabbage, and lime. First and foremost, presentation was UGLY. Why would you blanket the wings with Asian coleslaw. I had to dig through the messy Asian coleslaw just to see a wing. Digging for chicken wings. The wings aren't the dry wings, they are coated with sauce. The sauce on the wings and on coleslaw are the same and it's that repetitive Asian sauce you see at many American restaurants on Asian dishes. After a bite into the wings, I was presently surprised that I actually enjoyed it. The coating on the wings weren't too thick but it does require napkins and wipes afterwards.   I don't think I'll return because there are far more restaurants in LV to explore next visit.   Until the next review....",

I had a friend who works for the same company as CDO and for her one year anniversary they gave her four complementary meal vouchers or something of that sort so she invited me and my fiance.   I love the atmosphere of the restaurant, there's a rather spacious patio that's right next to the pool which I love sitting on. The inside is dark and it has a very quirky, hip vibe. All the servers are very knowledgable and authentic.  You absolutely NEED to get the pretzels with fondue. They are absolutely incredible. The soft pretzel nuggets are served fresh and steaming with a a sizable portion of melted cheesy goodness. The pork belly nachos were a gigantic serving, after those two apps I couldn't believe we still had an entree and a dessert each.  I ended up getting the Salmon to be on the healthier side of things. It was served with roasted cauliflower and a cauliflower puree and some cut up snap peas. The salmon was moist and cooked perfectly. I loved every single bite.  Every experience I've had at CDO has been fantastic. The service is always on point, the food is consistently delicious, they have a lot of local beers, and the decor makes it a great place to go with groups and out of towners.",

The dining area opens up to the infamous Hard Rock grotto/pool. Bold patterns and bright colors decorate the interior. The waiter emphasized the \"scratch\" cooking that takes place in the kitchen, but to me, this is a vague, almost meaningless term. Maybe this is Dropout's way of justifying a bland menu of soups, salads, and sandwiches. My seared tuna salad was good, but just good, and probably not good enough for the price I paid. I think if I was partying in the pool, I would love the convenience of this food. Or maybe I would enjoy just witnessing the debauchery. But saldy, the pool was closed, and I could only indulge in the conversation at my table.",

Don't they know how great they could be.  More like a barn   They should have made it like the AZ locations. Seventh st PHX and Scottsdale.",

I come to Vegas just for Culinary Dropouts food.  Best food in Town hands down.....   Thank you Daniel from the bottom of my heart for going above and beyond for me. Forever a loyal customer.

    "text": "While the Hard Rock is a bit off the strip, believe me it's worth the drive for happy hour! They have a large indoor seating area and a fun outdoor patio section with a view of their fancy pool.   Happy hour is Monday-Friday from 3-6pm. All of their draft beers are available in a small mug for $3! They have a good selection ranging from Chainbreaker White IPA, Lagunitas Pilsner, Stella, Apricot Hefeweisen, Coors light, etc. They also serve well drinks and sangria for $4.    You can't go wrong with the happy hour snacks. My top two recommendations are the kale salad and pretzels with fondue. The salad is the perfect size to pair with an appetizer and includes unique toppings like beets, cauliflower and goat cheese. The pretzel fondue is really something special! It's a blend of provolone and havarti and is served with soft pretzel rolls. I have begged for the recipe and even tried recreating it myself, but haven't figured it out yet. We have also tried their burgers and bourbon black bottom pie and have been very impressed.",

The food is fine.  The grilled cheese sliders, house made chips and dip, chicken wings, salads, Cap'n Crunch french toast all hit the spot.  In fact, I really could go for more of that french toast right now!    They had a nice drink selection too.  The Pistols at Dawn and the Manhattan were great concoctions that didn't skimp on the alcohol.    Sadly, I gotta knock off a couple of stars for the service.  It's friendly enough, but was just excruciatingly slow.  It took a while for a server to come around at all, and when they did, return trips were scarce.  Just paying the bill took about 10 minutes after we handed our cards over.  I even saw a party sitting next to us, their table empty, just get up and walk away.  A few minutes later, a waitress comes by with a tray of beers asking where they went.  Maybe they were just short staffed that weekend.    tl; dr - Good food and drink, fair prices.  Hopefully you are not in a hurry.",

    "text": "Vegas for a Bachelorette party... YES!!!! Being the maid of honor, I had planned that Vegas weekend to be chill, wild and relaxing all at the same time.   It was our first night in Vegas (Friday night) and since most of us drove out there from LA, I wanted the girls to have a relaxing night with dinner, drinks and the room right upstairs just in case someone wanted to call it quits early. Therefore, I decided to make reservations at Culinary Dropout. After reading a couple of reviews and checking out their pictures, I liked that it looked like a \"chill\" spot with live music, good drinks and great food.  To begin, the decor was very intimate and yet somewhat hipster-ish yet industrial at the same time. The live band was great. They even played Backstreet Boys!! Took me back to when I was a teen. Haha. Anyhow, the staff was great and our waiter was awesome! He was super attentive and beyond helpful. He definitely made sure we had drinks in our hands.   For dinner, I decided to go with the steak and potatoes... OMG! This dish is one of the most delicious dishes I've ever had. The meat was beyond juicy and extremely tender. The potatoes were saute perfectly. Just thinking about it makes my mouth water.  As a dessert, the waiter gave the bride to be a free Salted caramel custard topped with caramel popcorn. I had a little taste since I'm not big on dessert... deliciousness. It's enough for like 3-4 people since it's extremely sweet.  I would definitely go back to this place. 2 thumbs up!",

    "text": "I debated for quite awhile with myself about this review.  The fried chicken is the best I've had in Las Vegas.  It was a 6 star dish.  But, the rest of the meal was not, so that's how I arrive at 4 stars.  We had lunch at Culinary Dropout on a weekday around 1.  It was not crowded, a few tables outside and maybe 4 people at the bar.  So, we sat right down.  Our server came right over for our drinks, but after that, service was a little spotty.  I don't know if she was also working tables outside or doing something in the back, but I feel like we went long periods without even seeing her in the restaurant.  So, that was a little annoying.  To start, we had a charcuterie plate.  This includes a good amount of bread and some jam.  We had a blue, a cheddar, and some Iberico ham.  All of it was fantastic, the ham was, of course, the star.  Soft in texture and almost buttery, it's phenomenal.    For lunch, as I noted above, I had the fried chicken.  This includes 3 pieces, potatoes, a honey biscuit and gravy.  They drizzle a little honey over the chicken.  Not so much that it overpowers the dish or affects the crispiness of the skin, but enough so you get a little sweet taste with each bite.  This chicken was excellent.  Crispy skin that adhered to the meat, seasoned meat, and the meat remained juicy (even on the white pieces).  It's a steal at $22.  This dish came with a lot of hype, I had heard from many people how fantastic it was, and it delivered.  The potatoes were fine, both they and the gravy needed seasoning.  The biscuit was not as flaky as I like, and it was lukewarm.  So, those items were a little disappointing compared to the chicken.  But, I would certainly order this again knowing that the other parts of the dish were not as good as the chicken.  It's that good.  The wife had the grilled cheese and yesterday's soup, which was tomato bisque.  I don't usually care for tomato soups, but I liked this one.  Hearty and had a lot of seasoning.  Good tomato flavored accentuated by the seasoning.  It was of course excellent when you dip the sandwich into the soup.    I don't frequent the Hard Rock Casino, but I would absolutely return just to eat here again.  I recommend you do the same.",

We ordered the mystery drink shot thing and were disappointed that we ended up with keystone and some terrible raspberry whiskey shot for $8, but it was a mystery thing so we get what we get! I also ordered the pretzel bites which were delicious!!! (even better when you reheat them later after a night of drinking) I also ordered the steak tacos which were really good but I ate waaaay too many pretzel bites to really enjoy the tacos.  Our only complaint was the terrible service. After getting our food for us our waiter disappeared for over thirty minutes. We watched him chatting with other staff members, checking his phone, doing anything but coming over to see if we needed anything. We finally had to ask another staff member to get our checks for us.  I still give it four stars because the food was really good and I am sure some of the other waiters are more attentive!",

They had a nice seasoning to them and were cooked well, which is something that seems harder for restaurants to do than I'd imagine.  Their beer selection is a bit meh, with most of the beers being pretty common mega-brews.  The ambiance seemed a bit \"hip\" or \"cool,\" but we were there when it was pretty empty.

It was filled but not overly crowd and a band was playing very good music.  The order consisted of the fried chicken entree, which is to die for. This entree was shared by two people and the staff separate it and plated for two people without being asked.   We also had the nachos and wings with a side salad.  The food was hot and delish!  The chips in the nachos did not get soft or soggy.  They maintained their crispiness.  The wings had a slaw on top which was very tasty.  A big shout out to our waitress, Lorna.  The service is fabulous and the overall feel of the restaurant atmosphere is great. The GM came over and checked on us.  I saw him greet customers and also clean up tables.  The staff was very welcoming.  I plan to stop by on their happy hour to try it out.",

There was live music which is a nice touch and she was unique to say the least. The waitress was really nice, on point and was always around. The only con about the employees is you'll have no idea who they are since they are all dressed in street clothes. Someone  ordered the pretzel bites with fondue and everyone enjoyed them. I ordered the grilled cheese sliders (made with American cheese) and they were good if you're under 12 lol. Not what I expected for $12 but maybe I had my expectations set too high for this place. A couple of friends ordered the chicken club and it was huge, they liked it. I'll probably try this place again and order something different :)",

I think when they were hiring they also found a Music School dropout because the \"live entertainment\" was the worst I have ever seen; I'm actually pretty sure the girl was lip syncing.   I did have a good time and the food was okay however, this was nothing I'd ever want to experience again, especially for the prices they charge. $22 for average fried chicken, one biscuit, and freezing cold mashed potatoes? I could do better at Church's Chicken.  My wife had the trout, she said it was good but also agreed it wasn't worth the price and the wait. We were in the restaurant for about an hour and a half and it was just two of us, no drinks and no apps and all while having to endure the horrible singing.",

Well, that all changed today at Culinary Dropout inside the Hard Rock Las Vegas.   For those who have never been, don't let the name fool you. Whatever culinary school you dropped out of was probably not advanced enough to keep up with your creativity. The Korean Ribeye Steak suggested by our server Jenny was flawless. Perfectly seasoned and brilliantly executed, it left you wanting nothing. Would've posted a pic, but one bite became two, and the rest is history.   Fish and chips were probably some of the bat I've ever had. Extremely light batter, perfectly prepared as I've come to suspect is the norm here. Crazy good.   And let's not for Jenny, our server for the evening. Super charming and extremely attentive, she was spot on. From the complicated beer order of my friend to the small requests of salt and pepper, she was always there a smile. The perfect server for the perfect restaurant.   One word to sum it all up, WOW.",

I ended up soaking wet from the back of my legs to the top of my shirt.  Next, the food.  I the pretzel roll fondue was the highlight and that isn't saying much.  The rolls tasted like store bought, but the fondue was good.  Thus the one star.  I had the fried chicken.  It came out greasy with a biscuit that tasted more like lard and a dash of honey than anything else.  The gravy was not good either.  I ate less than half of the chicken.  My husband had the jambalaya.  It was basically a bowl of rice.  We were warned it was spicy but that was not the case.  The sausage was flavorless and he had ONLY TWO SHRIMP, both of which were mealy and the size of a quarter.  I've had better quality cocktail shrimp at Du-Par's downtown.  Not worth the price.  I woke up later that night with a racing heart, nausea, and clammy skin.  I ended up sick and for the better part of the next day all I tasted was the grease from that chicken.   As locals, we are always looking for a new, fun place to eat.  This ain't it.",

The ribs were dry, tough, and for some reason very salty (the rub) while the chicken was very dry and lukewarm. My friend is a big guy and didn't finish his meal and honestly went to Capriotti's for a sandwich afterwards. I tried this place a few years ago when it first opened and did not have a good experience but gave it the benefit of the doubt because it was new but it doesn't seem like things have changed too much which is unfortunate given the name of the restaurant.",

I asked for an expensive 30$ steak medium rare and it came out an hour and a half later completely well done and not even edible with just fries. Smallest steak i have ever seen and I cannot believe they completely destroyed the food! I was so disappointed that I sent it back and this was the first time that I have ever EVER done this in my life. I didn't want them to re-cook the steak because I didn't want to go through the experience all over again and instead asked for the check. We also found a huge hair in my girlfriend's grilled cheese....  I'm surprised this place has four stars. They did nothing to comfort us and I said I was all set because I didn't want to wait another hour and a half, when other customers were served before us on a quiet monday night!  This place is a joke. STAY AWAY! I'm not a picky eater and go to cheap chinese food bars across the united states, but this place is completely terrible and I literally couldn't eat here. After closing out our huge check when i didn't even eat dinner, I went directly across the hard rock to the next restaurant!   I was recommended to this place from a work colleague when we went to the Labman conference at HardRock. I will not be returning.",

Vegas is so full of what I call \"Las Vegas Templates\" that this was a breath of fresh air. Even though it's a cab ride off the strip, I've always found the Hard Rock Casino to be cleaner and less smokey and an awesome experience. Seeing Pete Townshend's guitar, Jimi Hendrix's coat, Paul McCartney's lyrics make hanging out a lot of fun. This restaurant had it all...a great menu where it's hard to choose, excellent beer and liquor selection and friendly & knowledgable staff. We were immediately steered towards the pretzel bites and fondue appetizer which was insanely good. I had the Korean Style Ribeye Cap that was 5 stars. Was also sold on the \"Smashed Irishman\" cocktail; Jameson Irish Whiskey, Guiness redux and mint which was phenomenal and had me ready to head to the blackjack tables, at which point, common sense luckily prevailed. I'm done giving the city of Las Vegas any more of my money, but can't say I feel the same way about Culinary Dropout. Can't wait to come back.",

I could eat this all day olives: the big green ones were good but the small ones were bitter. and of course you get more of the small ones fried chicken dinner: this was pretty good. The chicken was extremely moist, mashed potatoes were yummy and coleslaw was well made. Biscuits were to die for.  beef stroganoff: this was alright. the flavors were good but I thought the pasta would be thicker and chewier (more al dente). They claim it's hand made so I had high expectations. It was thin and blah.  pretzel and fondue dip: LOOKS good in pictures, but it wasn't very exciting at all. The pretzels did not taste fresh and the cheese dip isn't any better than the liquid cheese you get elsewhere.   Get the fried chicken!!",

    "text": "This was my first time visiting the establishment. I came in with a party of 12. We were properly dressed and we are GUESTS here at the Hard Rock Hotel. The hostess did NOT want to seat us at a table and the Bartenders at the bar would not make our drinks because we did not have a table. We were ignored for almost 20mins before someone came to speak with us.   Once our waiter came, he had a SNOBBY attitude, was very rude and short when answering our questions. We ordered 3 house salads that took almost 1 hour to get to our table. The additional Ceasar salad we ordered was WILTED. The waitress had a problem with taking it back to the chef. No one wants an old salad. All of our appetizers came to the table out of order and to the wrong person.   I will NEVER dine here again and I will make sure I let other people know to not visit this place either. They need to have a serious talk with their wait staff. Customers coming in to spend MONEY shouldn't be treated this way. Before leaving I spoke with the Manager Tony. He appologized, attempted to rectify the situation and was very nice.",

I simply asked the very nice server, Stephanie, if she would mention that my last sandwich was cold and I like them hot.  About 10 minutes later a fella from the kitchen served me with a smile and said, \"shaved prime rib dip, extra hot.\"  It was OUTSTANDING!!!  Problem solved!!!  I did ask for the GM on my way out... he laughed and said \"hey, you sandbagged me!\".  I knew if I asked for him up front things would be great and I sure don't wanna have to do that every time, though I sincerely appreciated his concern.  I'm back to being a happy customer of my favorite place and will be eating there again next week!!!",

Our friend ordered a salad & it came with no croutons....he needed carb crunch in his life. He asked our waitress and they made him fresh croutons. It did take a long minute BUT well worth the wait....THEY WERE YUMMY!!! Yup we all had to try one. We were all happy with our food. The chicken curry came with this magnificent sauce so that's when we ordered a side of bread to dip with.... DELISH!!!  I would highly recommend the curry chicken I think that was the best plate of the evening & don't forget the bread. There is indoor & outdoor seating and we loved the decor. Our waitress was sweet but a little slow. I do feel the place was a bit pricey for what you get. Overall I would give this place a 3.5 but cant figure out how to do 1/2 a star! lol",

When we got to the hotel around lunch time we had some free time to spend for lunch  We didn't want to go too far since we had to be at the hotel by a certain time so we searched for restaurants inside the hotel.  Culinary Dropouts sounded interesting since we've had Hard Rock Cafe and Pink Tacos before so about a 12 of us decided to check it out.  There we see the lunch menu was dominated by a selection of burgers so we all ordered burgers.  I had the pub burger.  Yummy the meat was juicy and the buns were so good~ I should've read the yelp reviews because I know I would totally enjoy the pretzel bites!  I ate everything to the last piece of fries :D  Service was great~ our waitress was fun and happy and had no problem serving our big party :). Thank you for a great time!",

The place was pretty empty but we got a nice window seating as the patio was way too hot for our likings... but the patio looked spacious & gorgeously open viewing the pool area. The decor of the place was fun casual w/ nice half booths & tables. They also had a little stage area as well which I assume for live performances.  Our server Trevor was very laid back & informed us on the menu. We jumped right in & ordered a couple of beers off happy hour & some bites.  TAP NO. 9 HH $3 - this beer wasbour replacement for the APRICOT heff... as they ran out =[ but it was light & crisp. The mug size was PERFECT for me as I was able to actually finish a glass since it was smaller... but for those of you who drink way more than I can... it may be a bit small.  GUINNESS HH $3 - perfectly poured GUINNESS always tastes the best w/ it's creaminess that I have no idea where it comes from when it is such a dark beer you would expect bitter bitterness.  HH PRETZEL & FONDUE $6 - this thing is freaken HUGE! I understand it is just dough... it was still big... LOVED it though... comes out w/ a little candle thing to keep the cheese fondue WARM for every pretzel piece you dip in there.  HH HAND CUT FRENCH FRIES $3 - fresh cut fries that taste like home cooked ones... obviously... cuz they are hand cut ahahaha   HH POTATO CHIPS & ONION DIP $3 - ummm the freaken DIP is AMAZEBALLS!! simple dish but so addictive that it was the first thing to disappear instantly.  Definitely wanna come back to try their other stuff.",

You get 1 one inch thick ketchup glazed slice with mashed potatoes and boiled green beans...its not worth $18. The flavor wasn't worth $18. The experience of it wasn't worth $18.  It was edible. So overall..you won't hate this place..its got a catchy hipster vibe..but there's better places to go.",

    "text": "This review is for 4.5 stars.  Culinary Dropout is the type of place I'd love to have in Summerlin.  Great HH portions and about 10 beers for $4 (all drafts) from 3-6pm.  I had the salmon brushetta to begin.  Great portion size.  The dish came with 3 large pieces of toast, smothered in great tasting salmon and a few anchovies.  I also ordered a kale and brussel sprouts salad with some added salmon to keep the fish theme alive.  This was a remarkable salad.  Large portion, fresh veggies, and even peeled sprout leaves, very unusual for a salad topping and more seen as a side dish.  I loved it in the salad nonetheless.  I couldn't finish it all so lunch will be tasty as a leftover.  The total cost of this was $30 after tax.  Not cheap but also similar to a downtown Summerlin or high end pub anywhere else in the country.  I really enjoyed the restaurant's food and overall menu and would surely recommend it as an event space, a HH destination, or even to listen to live music.",

It was 2:30 on a Tuesday and besides three other tables this place was empty.  I even left my phone to charge on the other side of the restaurant because it was so quiet. We ordered a burger and chicken wings. Besides talking to the hostess and waitress about our time limit and plans it took 35 minutes for the food. Pretty unacceptable. The burger was delicious but the chicken wings were disappointing. Dosing buffalo sauce on them does not make hot wings. Overall I'm really bummed, our quick bite on a Tuesday afternoon (after lunch rush hour) should not have taken over an hour.",

To start off, I went with the soft pretzels with fondue cheese for appetizer. The cheese was great! I also ordered the antipasti plate, which consisted of asparagus with balsamic dressing, prosciutto, marcona almonds, marinated olives, and homemade ciabatta. It was a very healthy plate, and it tasted great with the hot wings that I ordered too. The hot wings had mustard seed, buffalo sauce, shaved carrots, and celery. Pretty flavourful wings, definitely has a kick to it. My friend seemed to enjoy the turkey pastrami, and she finished it all!  Overall cool atmosphere, great service, and great food!",

We started our meal with wings, and while good, they do follow the American trend of adding unnecessary sweetness to their food, the hot wings were almost candied. Though thankfully they were saved by the equally tart and savory remoulade.  Their burgers are phenomenal! Great ingredients and flavors that were satisfying and clean, unlike the common fare which tend to cause me a greasy gut bomb coma.  We had their smokehouse bacon burger, awesome, hard wood smoked bacon that was good, though just a tad too smoky for my taste, and the coleslaw wasn't noteworthy.  Our last dish was the grilled salmon.. I thought it was a little overcooked and a little underseasoned, though the black rice and carrots were perfect.   And for the most important item, the brown bag special. I was especially fond of the brown bag specialty beer, as the atmosphere it brings fits their grungy theme, and single handedly completed our meal experience.",

Next, our main course both of choosing the Pub Burger with a nice side salad, was the epitome of a smorgasbord of Havarti, sesame seeds, BBQ, and meat. Truly an orgy or spectacular flavors.   The final course. The most important course: #dessert. The s'mores, which were my choice, was a delectable blend of chocolate mouse and creamy, creamy, cloudlike marshmallows. With homemade graham crackers for that authentic crunch. The banana cream pie was silky in nature, drizzled with a creamy caramel on the bottom, and topped with delectable cinnamon whipped cream. The flavors, on your tongue, in delicious yet sweet harmony. Oh boy!   That, ladies and gentlemen, is how you #cheatmeal.",

Our waiter seemed very confused or disoriented, double checking orders after leaving the table and making little mistakes on the orders themselves. The pretzels with fondue tasted good but the order is huge! The bites are more like a bengeit in size and there are enough of them to fed 6-8 people, which is great if you know that before ordering. The house salad was my favorite thing, pretty nice. Now, the Turkey pastrami was unbearably salty, I was starving but ate almost none of it. I thought maybe I should get rid of the pretzel but and just eat the inside but, it turns out that the Turkey itself was just salt and brine. It was really overwhelming and inedible. I drank a lot of water, waited way too long for the tab and left. The decorum is interesting.",

I wish I could give them a 10 because everything was hands down amazing from the food to their service to the ambience.    I came with a group of friends for a bday brunch.  We ordered a bunch of food unfortunately I was on the hungry side so I wasn't able to get any pics.  I ordered the garden kale salad and Avocado toast, I was hungry and needed to fuel up on some nutrients.  Out table also ordered the pretzels which smelled amazing, wasn't in the mood for too much bread so I passed on them.  The food was so yummy and the coffee omg so good! I asked with sever if it was Abel's to be purchased.  The company originated out of Arizona and the beans are locally brewed there.  The server was kind enough to give me information on how to order it online.    Speaking of service, outstanding.  They were so accommodating to our dietary request, even suggesting options to sub for our vegetarian friend.  She also suggested places to check out that are local hangout spots while we were in town.    The place was very clean and had a cool outdoor area.  Since we are staying in the dessert they are not used to the heat so much, so there are heat lamps everywhere to warm you while dinning outside during their \"winter\".  I would definitely return to this place if I am in the area again.  Not located to far of the strip in the hard rock hotel.",

The food was 4.5-5 star quality. We got the jambalaya split, but really it was enough food for one. And the pretzels which are just enough to split. I highly recommend both choices they were delicious. Our server was great as well. I already am planning my next trip back for drinks and to try the raw bar",

So, when I heard that Fox Restaurants was opening a Culinary Dropout in Vegas, I was very excited.  Fun atmosphere, with great natural light as both the bar and restaurant open up to the patio to overlook the pool at the Hard Rock.   Food seems to be right on par from the Scottsdale store - pretzel bread fondue, fried chicken and pork belly cubano, taste just like I remember - great flavor, good portions and good value.  Beer menu and cocktail menu is top ten on the strip (if you want to put Hard Rock on the \"Strip\").  I sat at the bar to watch some Sunday Football, our bartender was very friendly and it was good to see she had her bartending skills honed - technique looked sound and she makes a good crafted cocktail.  Thank god she served us, as another bartender came in later and she seemed to be to wrapped around her nails, her looks and some other bartender rather than serving any of the guests.    If only this was a neighborhood restaurant located at the District in Green Valley, I'd be a permanent fixture...  But I look forward to going back soon!  Sam, thanks for bringing Vegas a concept we have been lacking for way too long - next time, bring it to my neighborhood.  :)",

There were a few bartenders working but the main one that waited on us was named Arly.  She was very personable and attentive and gave us some great suggestions.  I started off with a bloody mary, which I like spicy, and she was definitely on her game.  I also tried \"The Smashed Irishmen\" which was also amazing,  I am a huge fan of both Guinness and Jameson and the cocktail is great.  For food I went with her suggestions and wasn't disappointed.  Me and my friend split a couple appetizers, including the Monkey Bread and Pretzel Fondue, and were very happy.  I will definitely be back cus everything about the experience was great.  The other bartenders were also nice and attentive, but when I go back I hope Arly is behind the bar.",

The Turkey Pastrami was great, so was the fried chicken and pretty much every thing else that came out to the table. I got a few oysters which turned out  to be way better then expected as were the pretzel bites.   As far as drinks go, you can slum it with tallboys of your favorite generic beers (PBR, MGD etc) or order a specialty cocktail - I had one of both and no complaints.   I'm not in Vegas that often so I probably won't come back but if I do find myself hungry and playing at the hard rock casino I'd probably stop in for a meal.",

I made a reservation for 10a via Opentable. Moseyed in right as they were opening & selected a table on the cusp of inside & outside. Perfect choice! From the hostess to the random employee passing by, everyone was super friendly & chill... my brunchmate seemed memorized by them. Not really knowing what portion sizes to expect, the two of us ordered 3 items to share: Cap'n Crunch french toast, grilled cheese sliders (with fries) & (a special item) asparagus toast. As for the portions- they are more along normal sized (to some they may seem on the small side), so the 3 items for us to share were perfect. The CC french toast was cool!... I'd totally get it again & highly recommend. The grilled cheese sliders & fries were tasty & had great texture... another one I recommend! The asparagus toast should be a regular item... perhaps swapping out the asparagus with whatever is in season? To be honest, I forgot what all was on it... I saw asparagus & was sold. There was perfectly grilled asparagus, truffle oil?, these amazing crackly potatoes & two sunny side up eggs. From the sweet, salty & texture perspectives, we were thoroughly satisfied! By the time we left, the place was full... reservations are definitely the way to go. I'm looking forward to going back again for brunch, but also checking it out for dinner!",

The $12 pretzel bread with provolone fondue was heavenly (I would have preferred cinnamon sugar as a dip, or maybe in addition to the fondu, but that's being too critical maybe). For entree, I ordered the vegetable chopped salad. It came out looking delicious, but it was totally bland (maybe a different dressing would have helped?). The pretzel bread was this place's saving grace. The bill was $50 for waters, two entrees (burger and salad) and the pretzel bread. Waaaay overpriced for a pub. I will not be going back.",

    "text": "Ok, I really dislike signing up for things like Yelp.  Passwords, account set up, log in, etc.  BORING.  But this place was worth the effort.  I was super hungry for some good fried chicken, which is hard to get outside of my mom's kitchen.  I ventured in late (about 11:30) on Friday night.  I wasn't sure what to expect because end of the night dining usually gets end of the night service, food, etc.  I was pleasantly surprised.       It started off with a stop by the hostess stand to ask if they were still serving.  She was nice.  Really nice.  That isn't always the case.  You know how some hostesses have that \"whatever\" attitude?  Like they are doing you a favor by talking to you?  Great first impression.  I've worked in hospitality and pay attention to things like that.  I told her that since I was eating alone I'd like a table where I could people watch.  She let me choose the table that I liked best.       My server went through the menu with me but I was set for the chicken.  It came out pretty quick but that was ok because I was hungry.  The dish looked great.  It tasted even better.  The chicken had a slightly sweet, crispy, not soggy breading and was juicy inside.  Man it was good!  The biscuits were ridiculous.  Almost like little cakes.  Soft and moist inside.  I almost asked for more.  Mashed taters were rich (lots of calories I'm sure) and the gravy was the best I've had in a restaurant.  Tasted like the kind that comes from a cast iron skillet in your kitchen.  The surprise was the coleslaw.  I really liked it.  Usually restaurants mess it up.  Too much vinegar or too much mayonnaise.  This was good.  It's rare that I like all of what I'm served in a restaurant.  You know when what you are hungry for tastes just like you want it to?  Bingo, it all hit the spot.       The manager was walking around checking on guests.  She recommended I try the monkey bread dessert.  So I did.  Think cinnabon meets your grandma's apple pie.  Comes with vanilla ice cream.  Soooooo good!!  The only problem is that I ate so much I had to take a nap in my car before I could drive home!  Lol.  JK.  The manager made a good call on that dessert though.  Perfect way to end my meal.   To sum it up...it was a great experience.  Great food, good service and a cool vibe inside.",

Cute and very comfortable decor. We ate inside but the outside patio looked inviting and fun.  Music and crowd was not too loud on a Thursday night so we could actually talk over dinner and watch the game.  We ordered the pretzels and fondue and we were overjoyed with flavor! I think it is their claim to fame! Fried chicken was recommended by Yelpers and waiter - nothing special, would not order again. Meatloaf had no flavor, would not order again either. Bacon Bloody Mary was tasty.  Dinner for two with appetizer and  two drinks was $90 bucks with tip. They had a pretzel special but waiter said it was only for happy hour but as we left the restaurant the special said NFL Game prices so hubby went back in and they adjusted the check.  Great service would visit again but just order pretzels, fondue and booze.",

Pretty yum with a sparkling sweetness!  [[ Pork Belly Toast ]]-- recommended by the server and it tasted surprisingly asian. Pork belly wasn't super crisp but rather fatty and thick. Served on a single baguette slice, cut in 3. The sauce was sweet and tangy with maybe bit of soy sauce? Delish!  [[ Shaved Prime Rib Dip ]]-- mmmm!! Super soft bread with a very FULL serving of tender (not dry!) shaved prime rib. It made the sandwich super easy to eat but also fed the appetite all night. I suggest getting the coleslaw with it.  [[ Grilled Cheese Sliders ]]-- How adorbs are these tiny sliced bread as my sliders! Haha comes with 3 sliders. Cheesey cheese and bacony bacon! There's a slice of tomato in each but it didn't do anything for me.   Ambiance was casual cool and I appreciated that it was not the bit pretentious.

Either billed for things not ordered, or service has been less than stellar. This visit, I was seated promptly by the hostess. I sat there for 10-12 minutes, never once approached by any server. I had a couple of them look at me. Maybe they should be trained to ask if you have been helped and get whomever has that sections attention. I walked out and told the hostess why I was leaving. Hostess didn't even make an attempt to make things right.",

I don't have a lot of great things to say about the Hard Rock, but this restaurant is one of them. You feel like you're in a hipster joint in the cool, up-and-coming neighborhood rather than in the back of a smoky casino. Definitely start with the pretzel rolls, and take the staff's recommendations on drinks. Some of the fare is common, but some of it is uncommonly good---like the pierogies. Having grown up in the pierogi capital of the world, I certainly couldn't pass them up. I'm so glad I tried them, as they were delish! My friends enjoyed their sandwiches and salads (though the small house salad isn't anything to write home about and I didn't finish it). Overall, a great atmosphere and great food, if you happen to be out that way.",

    "text": "Culinary Dropout is a fantastic restaurant located in the Hard Rock, Las Vegas. The menu is fresh and the food is delicious.   We ordered pork belly toast with chips and dip to start. The pork belly toast is so juicy and flavorful. The combination of pickled items with cilantro, the chili oil, Sriracha aioli, and the tender pork belly on a crispy toast that soaks up all the juice goodness is to die for. I would eat two of these as a meal. I was pretty bummed to share such goodness with my husband. Fortunately, the chips and dip were enough for 3. We took the pork belly toast plate and poured the leftover sauce on the plate all over the chips.  It was fantastic. The French onion dip cooled my tongue down from the slight spice on the pork belly appetizer. The chips were super thin and very crispy. They're perfect.   When our food arrived, I ordered some fries since my Korean cap comes solo. It was a lot of meat and tons of vegetables. The Korean flavor was great with some serious spice. I couldn't stop eating. My husband's chicken was hard not to eat, so I grabbed the drumstick and dove in. I love how crunchy and hot the chicken is, and the coating has a ton of flavor. Their chicken is super tender and juicy, and between the homemade biscuit with a but of mash, gravy, and coleslaw-say goodnight!   The fries were beautiful. They come hot, fluffy, and with the perfect amount of salt. I almost ate the basket solo but I shared at one point.   Good food makes people happy, and this restaurant left me smiling. I'm I'm a fan and will be back for more.",

We were told a party of 15 would be fine, if you can't do more than a few split checks on a table, for both your sake and ours TELL THEM BEFOREHAND. We waited over 45 minutes for her to bring us the correct checks and she still didn't get them right. Although she was friendly, I really would've appreciated if she checked on our table more than once to take our drinks, and the second to take our food orders. I had to walk up to her 15-20 minutes after everyone was done with their entree to ask for the check. Just because you automatically get a 20% gratuity, to be prejudged that we weren't going to tip well because we're in our 20's makes you look foolish and lazy.   The service from the Culinary Dropout in Arizona was 100 times better than our experience in Vegas. I wasted my friends birthday on subpar service and I certainly won't be back, ESPECIALLY knowing our business supports inconsiderate managers. Hard pass.",

The ambiance of the large outdoor dining area was, as expected, a pleasant visual treat aided by a setting sun and surrounding mood lighting.  Two tables had been set aside for this pairing event and shortly after the scheduled time the Culinary Dropout (cool name) crew got on with the good stuff - a five part/course pairing of food and brew.  Tony (AGM) and Ben proceeded to describe each upcoming brew and dish with fine detail.  So what's behind my 5-star rating?  Several off-property chefs participated in the tasting. Two of them did not favor one of the brews offered but respected all dishes in the pairing.  Although not a proclaimed \"foodie\" myself, it is noteworthy to report that each pairing was appreciated by all served. One woman and a visiting chef (noted above) found the Apricot Hefeweizen not to their liking while my opinion was that of great balanced and a welcome pairing choice.  Not a favorite, but the Starter (Antipasti paired with the Apricot Hefe) was a good effort and primer for the main dishes.   Poussin paired with Scottish Ale (2nd course) did the trick and was followed up by Double Bock Braised Short Ribs paired with a Devastator Double Bock - wonderful!  The S'Mores Tart was stellar. Eager to dig in I snapped a picture after already enjoying two bites. The Outer Darkness Imperial Stout made for a wise pairing for this tart.  Despite almost all pairing seats being occupied, service was top-notch. Timing between pairings was relaxed and each dish/brew was served as if you were a VIP.  Congrats to Tony, Ben and Chef Mike - I'll be back!",

    "text": "The name itself sounds rebellious, so I had huge expectations of rowdiness when I came here but was pleasantly surprised at how classy and friendly the staff was.    Culinary Dropout was our first stop in Vegas when we arrived.  We were hungry, thirsty and needed to start partying after our flight from Orange County. We arrived in Las Vegas at 9 PM, so we were lucky enough to miss the dinner crowd, but I had reservations regardless (which I booked through <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FOpentable.com&s=e2215de09505b8fbf3a047b68af38708cbc8b52c843ab34faaecc46b3704d557\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Opentable.com</a>).  The restaurant wasn't very crowded, but the people who were there seemed to be enjoying their time drinking and laughing.  Our server was very sweet, accomodating and was on top of our orders.  I wish I could remember her name, I'd like to say thank you for getting our weekend off to a great start with her great service.  The ambiance is super laid back, casual and teetering on the hipster side.  I can see it working for a party with friends, or a romantic date.    We decided to order apps instead of meals so we have a little more room for alcohol (ha!).  We ordered the artichoke hearts, pretzel fondue (that everyone on Yelp is raving about), and a charcuterie of Iberico ham and manchego cheese.  Artichoke hearts:  tender, with a slightly smoke flavor.  It had this cheesy cream that went well with it, topped with baby spinach.  They also drizzled it with an orange marmalade which I personally didn't care for.  I like orange marmalade on toast, but not on my artichoke hearts.    Pretzel fondue:  Everyone was raving about this here on Yelp.  I found it too salty for my liking.  There was almost too much salt on the pretzels and the fondue (served in a cute little pot and tealight warmer) had a slightly gritty texture, and that was salty too, reminded me of Cheez Whiz out of a jar.  Maybe they made it salty on purpose because we were pounding beer after beer to wash it down.  Now for the BEST part of our meal, the Iberico ham: O.M.EFFING.G. Talk about melt in your mouth awesome goodness.  It was like butter, no gaminess, with a slightly sweet note in the back.  It went well with the slightly salty bitterness of the manchego cheese.  They served it with a cherry compote on the side and two pieces of crostini bread and made a fancy little ham and cheese sandwich.  Mind you, they gave us maybe half a cup of thin ham shavings at MP $19.  Bottom line, would I come back here?  Probably not.  With all the various and unique dining experiences Vegas has to offer, I don't think Culinary Dropout is memorable enough for me to take time out of my precious vacation to venture back here.  At least I can say that I gave it a shot, and that I actually finally got to taste Iberico ham.",

Needless to say, I will be back!",

I know that is what is expected. Does it make it worth it? No.   We ordered drinks, appetizers and two main dishes. $160.   The drinks were good. The food was good, but not extraordinary. That's my main problem with a lot of these joints on the strip. It's so hard to justify the price. Although, I'm always willing to try new places, I leave feeling disappointed or jipped.  The service was good, but it was very slow. We didn't get checked on much, and it took forever to get our check, and another 20 minutes just for the server to come back to run them.   If you're wanting to come here, just know that it is a bit more pricey. Especially the drinks.",

The space is very cute, nice couches inside, open kitchen, great bar, and an awesome outside space with fire pits. We sat at the bar until we noticed the fire pits and big comfy chairs.  We moved over outside and our bartender, Dylan was accommodating enough to continue taking care of us while we went out. Must say, he's a great bartender! Accommodating, fun, and most of all makes delicious drinks.  Cocktails I had: Deviant behavior - comes with a side of Belgian white beer. Not my favorite, I'm not a fan of cocktails with beer I guess; Monkey See, Monkey Do - delicious! It has rum and pineapple, among other things, really good! Pomegranate Yuzu Mule - my favorite drink, so freaking good! I subbed vodka for gin (he is not my friend), it comes with yuzu sour, pomegranate juice, and fresh pomegranates on top.  We also tried their potatoes chips which were pretty good. My friends loved them. I really enjoyed our time here, next time I come I will make sure I'm hungry so I can try some of the food. The food menu looks very promising.",

They had both red and white, both were delicious. I ordered the pork belly nachos, only 9$ and the portion was HUGE, I almost couldn't finish them. We also had the pretzels with cheese, and they are hands down the best I've ever had. The cheese it came with was SO delicious and flavorful, you could definitely tell it wasn't some cheap cheese from a can! When I return (which I definitely will) I'll be ordering those again.

By this time I'm starving, time feels like it's flying by. We had plans to eat at a particular place but that fell through so Yelp came in handy once again. Let's eat at Culinary Dropout, we're going to the Hard Rock so it's convenient, I made a reservation just in case.  So we got there about 7:30 and the place was busy but suprised to see alot of open tables (probably because it's such a big space). Seated by the kitchen, I got to watch the action. Everyone of the staff were working their butt off but it looked smooth and cohesive at the same time.  Now I grew up eating pierogi, when bought costing about 50 cents a piece. I can't believe I spent 11$ on 3 pierogi! But they were so good, loved the little cauliflower bits, don't tell mom but I'd do it again! We also got the Prime Rib Dip with Chips and Onion Dip, also really good. I wish we had more time to grub out but we had a show to get to.  Our waitress was great, loved the atmosphere. I can't wait to go back, I have my 11$ ready!",

Our server Barry (new) did a great job! The modern atmosphere with rustic touches gave a nice want to Party touch!  Recommend coming here on a visit to Vegas they do have a Raw Bar on site!

We, and every table around us, used their phone to read the menu.  This level of darkness at a restaurant is ridiculous.    On to the food.  Everything was delicious!   Starters: Soft pretzels w/ provolone fondue $12.  OMG, this creamy, velvety fondue is one of the best liquid cheese creations I have ever had.  I could eat it everyday. Cheap House Salad $6.  This was just okay.  No taste complaints, but the 'buttermilk ranch' was not really evident.  Drinks: Between You & Me: Belvedere, grapefruit, cranberry, and lemon.  Very refreshing and a little tarte.  Enjoyed.  The BF had a beer on tap- can't remember which, but it was nice and cold the way he likes his beer.  Main course: Ma...the Meatloaf!?! $18. Served with green beans and mashed potatoes with gravy.  This one took me back to grade school.  I could have sworn that my grandmother was back there making this meal.  If you want 'comfort food' with a homemade taste, this is the dish for you.    Fried Chicken $22 served with mashed potatoes and gravy, cole slaw, and a buttermilk biscuit.  Really good chicken.  Super crispy golden exterior, juicy flavorful chicken inside.  Same tasty potatoes, and the cole slaw was a bit bland.  Desserts: Bourbon Black Bottom Pie $7 and Salted Caramel Custard $8.  The pie and the custard were both too rich for us, but the salted caramel corn that comes on top of the custard was like crack!  We could have eaten a movie theater bucket of that stuff!",

Salmon and other toppings were great. Still, avocado toast without avocado is nothing but a heap of disappointment. I wonder if it was even prepared with a whole avocado or a store-bought avocado spread. Egg white frittata had little flavor to it and came with kale on top, which didn't compensate for the lack of flavors. The best part of the meal was the appetizer pretzels.  I recommend visiting other places in the hotel or ask for items that are popular. The decor is interesting and aesthetic. Service was good and all the staff were friendly and welcoming.

I was eating alone but wanted to try their BBQ pork nachos, soft pretzel fondue style and monkey bread pudding. They have me happy hour price half orders during their happy hour time. Got myself a watermelon sangria that was delish too! Stephanie was my awesome server and the hostess was so helpful with seating and directions for Lyft pick up. A lovely spot that is definitely bring many friends and family to. We are all eaters and I know they will love it!  Please note that there is no happy hour on concert nights.  Planning on trying their oysters at their bar.",

The pretzel and cheese appetizer was probably my favorite part. I also tried the fried chicken that is in a honey batter and the prime rib french dip. For desert we had the caramel popcorn on custard and the monkey bread with ice cream.... MMMMMM!  Had excellent service as well. Our waitress kept our drinks refilled and the manager even said hello as we were being seated and gave some food suggestions.",

    "text": "Pros: Food was great! We got the pretzels and fondue which was delish. My eldest got the pan seared steak and he loved it. My youngest got the Italian salad and he was pleased. My man got the ribs and said they were the best ever. I got the vegetarian entree, sweet corn cannelloni, and I would def go back for it. So, that being said, the food made everything else worth it.  Cons: it was very noisy, but we were at the hard rock hotel, so that's to be expected. My biggest issue was the temperature. It was about 107 outside and for whatever reason they had the wall behind the bar open, which let all the hot air in. I was literally sweating balls the whole time and it was after 9. Uffff. I guess it helps with their beer sales.",

Next we split the kale and corn salad before splitting the fried chicken. The food was all yummy. Splitting the salad and entree was super smart. The portions are large.  The waitress grabbed a seat with us to chat, checked in on us enough to be cared for and the perfect amount of leaving us to our  ourselves so we could talk. Loved it and will be back soon.",

    "text": "I didn't know what to expect upon hearing the name of this restaurant.  Was it run by culinary students who failed culinary school?  And if so, do we dare host a job interview meal here?  I don't know the origins of the restaurant name - but we did host our job interview meal here last night and had a wonderful dinner!  This is a must see, must eat Vegas restaurant!!    There are oh, maybe, 500 restaurants \"to see\" in Las Vegas - this is one of them!  Culinary Dropout blew my mind.  It is beautiful!!   It is Classic Industrial at it's finest!  The furniture is contemporary classic - tufted sofas, wingback chairs, wooden industrial tables.  Simply stunning decor.  Beautifully decorated with a wall of windows overlooking the HRH pool, with a GINORMOUS patio outside that probably seats 100 people easy.  Hands down, best patio dining I have seen in Las Vegas!!     I'm a terrible Yelper for not taking photos.  I was interviewing a job candidate - not showing off my YELP skillz.  You will have to go see the place for yourself!   The food?  Oh yeah, the food!  They have an awesome starter menu of Antipasta where each table can individually create their own antipasta plate by filling out a menu card - similar to sushi places where you mark what you want.  We started with a few meats and cheeses - all of which we enjoyed.  They are served with some bread and mini breadsticks that resemble pretzels.    The menu contains a little bit of everything.  Really, everything.  From meatloaf, to chicken curry, to fried chicken, to steak, to jambalaya, to a slew of salads and sandwiches.  There is something for everyone here.    I decided to order the Bistro Steak - served with house fries and a gorgonzola sauce.  I don't consider myself a Steak connoisseur by any means - but this steak was awesome!!  Perfectly tender and juicy and charred - and served off the bone in a strip of mini segments of meat.  The fries are hand-cut and also very good.  My dining partners had the fried chicken and the salmon - both of which were devoured.    For dessert we shared the Monkey Bread that other Yelpers recommended.  Served hot with a side of ice cream, it is PERFECT for sharing and was amazingly delicious!!    Prices are actually reasonable - but if you want to enjoy the place you can expect about $50 per person with drinks for dinner.  Our party of 3 with many drinks, appetizer, entrees, and dessert ran us $177.    The service was excellent - their beer selection is \"crafty\" and \"traditional\" and the restaurant ambiance is stellar.  We had a very enjoyable meal - staying for almost 3 hours and enjoying every minute.  I will return here soon with my husband and friends!!",

We used to go to Johnny Small's at the Hard Rock, but took a chance on this restaurant.  We sat at the bar and had the best happy hour food we've had in a long time.  The draft beer was 3 dollars a mug (note, not just domestic... draft), and we got Grilled Cheese Sliders, Smoked Salmon Bruschetta, Kobe Beef on a Stick, Antipasto, and it all came in under 40 bucks!  Amazing wait staff, great bar staff, and this place is now officially on our top eats list when we're visiting in Vegas.  Thank you guys for such an excellent culinary experience!",

    "text": "2013 Spring Restaurant Week Review:  While walking through Hard Rock I saw a sign stating \"Patio Open.\"  So, I put on my leg brakes and walked straight on in.  The restaurant is huge and looks like Restoration Hardware threw up all over it.  The servers all look like they were bussed in from Williamsburg.  But, my only focus was the outdoor seating.  It's glorious, by the way. Comfy banquettes, outdoor bar, poolside, and firepits. Fire!  Oh, anyways, the food.   I chose the carrot-ginger soup, fried chicken, and chocolate tart options from the RW menu.   My table also went for the pretzel and cheese fondue appetizer.    The pretzel fondue was really great.  The pretzels were soft and chewy and the cheese was delicious, although a little clumpy.  I do wish they served the cheese a little hotter.  Overall, a great appetizer.  My first course, the carrot-ginger soup, was really flavorful.  I couldn't eat it all so I asked for a box.  Instead of boxing my leftovers, they gave me a whole new soup!    The second course, the fried chicken, was pretty good.  There were three huge pieces and each was moist on the inside, crunchy on the outside.  Unfortunately, the chicken was bit too salty for me, but the batter definitely had a great flavor.   The dish also came with a tasty honey biscuit, coleslaw, mashed potatoes, and gravy.  I really enjoyed the coleslaw because it wasn't caked in dressing.   My favorite part of the meal was probably the toffee chocolate tart.  I've been on a tart kick lately and this one was the best of the batch.  The chocolate was dark and rich but not too sweet.  A great way to end the meal.  Our server, Thanon (sp? Sorry!), was the nicest server I've had in a long time.  He went out of his way to make our meal amazing. He even offered to box up my leftover Sazerac! Who does that?!?! I would go back just for the service, it was that good.  The food, overall, is probably a 3 star experience, but the service and ambiance deserve extra stars.  I'll go back for sure!",

We were right by the Hard Rock Cafe Hotel so we decided to give it a try.   The waitress was friendly and we were immediately seated.   I took the advice of my fellow yelpers and immediately ordered the puffy pretzel bites with cheese fondue. Oh my gosh just order them. You get a basket of 12 warm pretzels. They are not hard and accompanied by cheese fondue.  Perfect for sharing.   We then shared a turkey burger which was also excellent. What I liked most about the place was that it was nice but not too pretentious. After all, it is VEGAS. We weren't ordering a lot of food and we didn't get any attitude. There were some dressed up people but others were casual.  They have a pretty big beer and whiskey list.  They had a live musician playing on a stage. The music was entertaining but not overpowering. It was a cold and rainy day but if not I would love to sit outside on the patio- they have fire pits- a great place for a big group.",

Well they weren't!  Had the pretzel fondue and yesterday soup for starters and both were great! Soup was very flavorful and came with a slice of toasted seasoned garlic bread. Only critique here might be a little less seasonings on the bread so you can use it to balance the taste of the very flavorful soup to your preference. The fondue was nice and saucy after having a chance to heat up. To make it easier for hungry diners to dig right in, perhaps it could have been melted to saucy consistency right before serving. It was only Luke warm when it got to the table, but warmed up nicely after a few minutes. After that, consistency and taste of cheese and pretzels were great!  Fried chicken was the main course and it did not disappoint! Cooked perfectly juicy tasty and tender, you get half a chicken, two sides and a biscuit so be hungry! Or share.   Monkey bread for dessert. Fresh from the oven with a big scoop of vanilla ice cream on the side. Like a different kind of apple pie a la mode.  If you have room left to enjoy this is the dessert to get! Or jut come in for dessert after a night of party or gaming.",

    "text": "Been hearing good things about CD recently so I finally stopped in with a group of people for dinner.  Apparently, several in the group hadn't heard of CD and were putting me under the gun for my recommendation...in the end everyone gave me props.  We started with some antipasti which was all very good and if that's your thing I would recommend giving a meat, a cheese, olives, and tomatoes a whirl.  But at the very least, get yourself some of the 'crusty bread and good olive oil'  The bread was awesome and the olive oil was even better, I'd get it every time.  So many of the items on the menu sound good it was tough to decide.  The overwhelming favorite order was the Turkey Pastrami...how can you go wrong with a pretzel bun?  I was fortunate enough to convince a friend to go halfsies on the Turkey Pastrami and the Shaved Prime Rib dip.  We both agree the dip was phenom and the better of the two choice.  They have a pretty solid selection of beers and actually offer a cool deal where for $2.95 you can get a cheap as hell beer in a brown bag.  The beer was sort of a mystery and I think it changes every so often...it would even be better if it changed order to order.  This go around it was a 'Buck Range Light'.  I had never heard of it but someone at the table had.  The waiter mentioned they have some nice specials certain nights.  I think on some Sunday's they do $3 Jameson drinks and $1 oysters if you're into that.  The only thing keeping Culinary Dropout from a 5 star rating (in my opinion...obviously) are the portions.  For the prices we paid for a sandwich, I thought they could have been a little bigger.  The shave prime rib dip was amazing, but the given the size i could have had 1.5-2 easily.  For an $18 sandwich I'd hope to at least have to put up a fight to finish or feel full afterwards.  That's my only warning, otherwise, it's a pretty cool and delicious place to grab a meal.  They even feature outdoor seating for days when it isn't 115 degrees.",

    "text": "I have dined at Culinary Dropout twice, both before concerts. Even though I made a reservation each time (7pm on a Tuesday, 8pm on a Friday), it didn't seem necessary. My guest and I were seated without a wait. The ambience is cool, yet comfortable. It is difficult to identify servers since they do not have a uniform, but they are very attentive.   On to the food...like all of the previous posters, you will do yourself a disservice if you don't have the soft pretzels with provolone fondue. If you don't use all of the cheese, save it for your meal. My husband dipped his fries in it and also spread it on his perfectly grilled burger. I had the chicken club sandwich. The chicken breast was grilled, tender, and flavorful. With the turkey, bacon, lettuce, tomato, and honey mustard, it was a perfect combination of flavors and textures.   I highly recommend saving room for dessert. This was my favorite part of the meals. The monkey bread is baked when you order it, served warm a la mode. Very delicious. However, I think my new favorite is the caramel custard. The very generous portion of the salted caramel custard has a consistency similar to creme brulee. It is topped with a thick layer of caramel syrup and their own delicious caramel corn. It is decadent and rich, more than enough to share with one or two people.   This restaurant may be a good replacement for a fun meal since Johnny Smalls closed.",

The restaurant had a nice energy and vibe and what was really cool is there is an outdoor area that's near the pool. Being that it was Feb - the weather was slightly cool but they had heat lamps to make it comfortable. The outdoor area is quite expansive and features 'cornhole' games and it was a nice respite from the noise inside. Ordered the pretzel bites with fondue to start the evening. As other reviewers have mentioned this can maybe be shared by 4 people. Nice warm almost small cup cake sized sea salt pretzel 'bites' and a small cauldron of provolone cheese fondue that was heated by a small tea light candle - YUM! My guest had the Turkey Pastrami sandwich with a side salad and I had the fish & chips. The sandwich was good portion sized and the fish was not overly breaded and nice and crisp with sides of ketchup and tartar sauce. The fries were average but served nice and hot. Everything was served promptly - there some nice cocktail options as well. The table next to us had the Italian 'grinder' sandwich and the shaved Prime Rib Dip sandwich with au jus. They said they were really good. The food and atmosphere is reminiscent of what I would say more of a pub type feel. A fun place to gather with friends for before or after a show or to watch a sporting game on the many tvs throughout both inside and outside. Check it out!",

The meat fell off the bone, the sauce was fantastically flavorful, and the sprouts roasted to perfection. The waiter was attentive, service was quick and I enjoyed my experience.  Unfortunately, tonight I went back tonight for dinner and had a terrible experience. I was seated by the hostess at the bar and was told there was a waiter working there. After about 10 minutes with no waiter or service, the man sitting next to me commented on the poor service I was receiving and that he had received. He said they ordered appetizers that came after their meal and their meal took forever to arrive. He also said while they were waiting 2 other people had been seated where I was and both of those people had given up and left due to no service. I waited about 5 more minutes and during that time, the men on my other side were delivered their appetizer, also after their meal. Eventually, I gave up and right as I was leaving, the waitress arrived but I had already soured on the experience and didn't want an extended wait for food, my check, etc. so I left.",

I wouldn't get those again. The fried chicken was all around decent, but not unique in any way. Normally, I'd be happy with that. However the whole theme of this place is pushing the boundaries. Wait staff and service were great. I'm leaving less excited than I entered and can't really recommend.",

We were seated promptly and were quickly greeted by our server. We started off with the pretzel and cheese fondue (thanks yelpers!) which was the best part of the meal. I had fish and chips - they were soggy but had a decent taste. My husband had a club sandwich which was meaty, a large potion but just average in taste. Our server was pretty good just a tad slow at times.   The vibe there was geared towards 20 something's which left us feeling a bit out of place. I felt I was too clean cut and clean to be here!!  We would probably not come out of our way to eat here again. Any of this food I could easily find on the strip. Then again, that pretzel shiz was pretty darn good!",

He was attentive, thoughtful, pleasant, and just the right amount of directivensss to help this group of powerhouse/crazy women create a brunch that was second to none. By the end, we felt like he was a part of our friend circle. In fact, we came back the next day and waited to be seated in his area.   We love you Paisley! Thanks for making our trip that much better!  He basically should just train all of the waiters and waitresses in America...at the very least, he should get a raise or promotion!",

Sprawling in size with garage-style doors open to the cool morning breeze of a picturesque patio it was close to the rounded bar with a full view of both stage and kitchen that our trio found itself located mere moments after entry and with coffee kept brimming from seating to finale a six-piece order was crafted, each item arriving individually with smooth pacing and beautiful presentation.  Largely focusing on signatures but equally willing to explore seasonal preps and brunch-only items it was with the restaurant's oft raved pretzel bites that the meal began and with rich fondue gilding golden soft nuggets we all agreed that rare has a pretzel impressed so much, a similar praise heaped on the house burrata with seasonal accoutrements drizzled with aged balsamic.  Moving next to things more substantial it was admittedly with some disappointment that neither the $11 French Toast nor the $21 'worth the wait' fried chicken proved nearly as memorable as their respective milk jam or biscuit plate-mates, but with the former too bready and the later far from crispy there are simply better versions to be found elsewhere, particularly at such a cost.  At this point sated but certainly not full, the kitchen would quickly rally back with a duo of desserts and while the piping hot monkey bread certainly deserves the attention it has garnered it was the caramel-corn studded budino that stole the show for me, a dense pudding both salty and sweet with crunch and cream taken perfectly with another cup of coffee as Chris Cornell crooned overhead.",

Their food is awesome too. For snacks, they make their own potato chips with an onion dip but my favorite thing on their menu are the hot pretzel bites served with a fondue dipping sauce. RIDICULOUS!!!! I ate those 2 nights in a row and could polish off an order all by myself. For happy hour they are half price too!!!  They also have a kick ass kale and corn salad and to-die-for SWEET POTATO CANNELLONI. The pasta is so thin so you can taste the filling which is a beautiful mixture of smoked shallots, mushrooms, snap peas, and parmesan. LOVE this place and wish there was one in LA!!!",

    "text": "Culinary Dropout has quickly become one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas. The food at the Hard Rock has always been a bit lacking to be honest, with the exception of Nobu. But now with Culinary Dropout, they have one of the best casual dining experiences on the Strip.  I'm not exaggerating when I say after 6 visits, I've yet to find a bad thing on the menu. I'll say my favorites are the Shaved Prime Rib Dip, the Fried Chicken and the 36 Hour Pork Ribs. The pretzel fondue is great, but I prefer the mussels, which are the best I've had anywhere. The Monkey Bread makes a great desert, but I'm especially fond of the carmel corn custard. It's really rich, but really, really excellent.  The service is fantastic. The staff is friendly and go out of their way to make you feel comfortable. The decor is very cool and casual. It really feels like a place you enjoy hanging out.  They have music on Thursdays of Fridays. I haven't experienced it yet, but it looks like it would be a good time.   If you're staying at the Hard Rock, this place is a must. If you're not, it's still worth checking out if you can.",

Great vibe, cool decor with lots of wood and metal and an awesome chilled seafood station, hip bar, and awesome patio with views of the pool.  SERVICE:  5 stars.  Similar to other places that require you to have a certain amount of flair a la' OFFICE SPACE, I think the servers and other workers here are required to have a certain amount of tattoos and piercings!  The service is excellent, the staff knows their menu inside and out.  The bartenders deserve special mention as their craft cocktail menu is really unique and really good!  FOOD:  5 stars.  Upscale bar/pub food!  The soft pretzels are homemade and served with a delicious cheese fondue. The fish and chips is AWESOME!  The chilled shrimp, oysters, etc, are great.  I have eaten here probably 5 times over the last two years and I have never been disappointed!  ALCOHOL:  5 stars.  Very creative and diverse bar menu.  OVERALL:  5 stars!  This place is a lot of fun, with great service and really good food!",

I've been quite a bit and the food keeps me coming back but I had to mark the place down due to the staff.

However, I will warn you, the patio is next to the pool.  Great scenery but there were a massive group of drunk guys sitting next to us doing typical drunk dude things. Not their fault and they did a great job of policing the behavior when it got out of hand.   The server, Ben I believe his name was, was incredibly patient.  He walked us through was great, good, or don't go there items on the menu.  You could tell he really cared about his work and wanted us to have a better than average experience.  He was like this with all his tables, not just us.  We started with the artichoke appetizer, amazing!  The candied lemon really brought everything tougher.  We enjoyed a stellar bottle of Cabernet from Napa called Newton; well balanced, not too fruity and it went amazing with the steak I had.  My date had the ribs, delightful.  They were a great balance of salty, sweet and spicy; again going wonderfully with the wine.  For desert we had a cross between bread pudding and apple pie, warm with cinnamon and carmel and a side of vanilla ice cream.  My mouth is watering just typing about it.    In all, this is a great relaxed date spot or a fun place to meet friends and sit in the sun enjoying good food and drinks.  I will definitely be eating here again soon!",

I wouldve have been happy if this was an entire meal).  now thats thats out of the way, here's my not so great experience...  Went to Hard Rock to see Andrew Dice Clay. My BF and I were debating on either Culinary Dropout or 35 Steaks & Martini's. We decided that Culinary Dropout seemed like a really cool concept, so we picked this place.  We arrived, ordered drinks and a salad. We wanted an appitizer so I go to order the grilled asparagus. Our waitress said it wasnt available ok, ordered the artichoke hearts, not available. Ok fine, ordered the crusty bread (see above). Then we waited and waited to order our food, I kinda had my heart set on Fish and Chips and again, it was not available. That is a really bad sign, we should've saw the red flags when we ordered the apetizer and collected our check to go elsewhere, but we were pressed for time so we decided just to get what was available.  My BF ordered the meatloaf and I ordered the bistro steak. We waited over 30 mins for our food to come out. Our waitress, even knew that we were there a while because she kept checking on us.  We get our food- my steak and fries were aveage at best. Nothing special. I could've had the same steak at Norms diner (No joke). I really felt bad for my BF because his food was even worse than mine. My BF's food- The meatloaf, seriously tasted like it was from a cafeteria with a squirt of ketchup on the top. Not a special custom/mixed ketchup, it was straight out of the bottle (my mom makes a better meatloaf). ......and the mashed potatoes... were not edible. They were cold and bland. My bf took one bite and said they werent good. I tried them to see if he was being dramatic, and he wasn't.   It was all very disappointing and I expected something much better- AT least the name is fitting to the food- Culinary Dropout. No kidding!   I wished we had a better dinner experience on our last night in vegas. Oh well :(",

Our group decided to get the pretzels with cheese considering its national pretzel day... but with a larger group we didn't know if more people ordered more than one pretzels. So the food runner brought out two, okay seems normal. Halfway through us eating our pretzels the foreign bartender comes up to us and takes our other pretzels that we have already been eating out of, AND DIPPING OUR PRETZELS in the cheese. He said that we only ordered one pretzel. Okay, so that's fine if we ordered one pretzel....... but he gave our already eaten pretzels and cheese to another guest!!! I've worked in the food industry my whole time in Vegas and that is absolutely disgusting. I understand if we got two food orders and he took it away and threw it away, but he gave our already eaten food to another guest that had no idea it's already been touched. I'm absolutely flabbergasted and it scares me because that can happen to anyone that isn't paying attention. Definitely will not be returning.",

Okay now food here is amazing. Real food! Simple yet delectable spices. I had the \"cheap salad\" with homemade buttermilk ranch, it was refreshing and the dressing was so good I ordered mas. I got the Brussels sprouts- they were served cold and I requested hot. They came out lukewarm but flavor was like grilled heaven. Next day I got the antipasto on happy hour. Best six bucks I've ever spent. The BBQ nuts were more addictive than the slots. The mini platter also came with manchego cheese, olives, shaved ham, and more Brussels sprouts!

Overall, the place exceeded me expectation, maybe because I've heard so many mixed reviews. Service was attentive. There was live band going on on a Saturday night. The atmosphere was great.    There were six of us. We ordered table full of stuff and shared. I've tried the following.  1. Pomegranate yuzu mule (1/5): did not enjoy my drink. Wouldn't get it again.   2. Thai chill chicken wings (4/5): pretty tasty wings. Although I would like it spicier.   3. Bbq pork belly nachos (5/5): I enjoyed the nachos a lot.  4. Pretzel and provolone fondue (4/5): pretty good combo. Would order it again.   5. Garden Kale salad (3/5): the flavors was good but bit too salty. Wish they can add quinoa or something to add in the additional texture.   6. Bistro steak and fries(2/5): did not enjoy the steak. The meat quality was meh.   7. Rainbow Trout (3/4): decent but not memorable.   8. The meatloaf (4/5): it was not too bad but not the best meatloaf I've had.   Overall, we had the great time trying out different appetizers and entrees. We enjoyed the live band as well. Will return again!",

I recently stayed for multiple nights at The Hard Rock Hotel and Casino and found myself drawn back night after night to dine here, by myself or with friends.   The food is consistent, tasty, and the staff blows the roof off any dining establishment I've been to. I have to take a moment and call out those that served me... Gary, Matt, Dillon, Jake, Hayley, & all the rest I met, because they had an awesome vibe, great anticipation of my needs during my meal, and above all else they made what can sometimes make for a business trip of meals alone into a warm, pleasant experience. That's why I keep going back, because I felt like I was spending my meal with friends. If you haven't tried Culinary Dropout I urge you to give it a try you won't be disappointed.   Personally I recommend:  Starters: Sherry Beet Salad, Deviled Eggs, Hummus Cheap house salad with gorgonzola dressing  Entrees: The fried chicken (it's amazing) The Meatloaf  Dessert: Banana Creme Pie (trust me on this)",

    "text": "I love the name of the restaurant,  I love their pretzel fondue even more!   Service:  Other than lunch visits for work, I usually sit at the bar to stay as close to the booze as possible.  Lunch service has never been an issue and the bartenders who pull double duty as your server have always come through.  Everyone has been friendly and social.  Food:  The pretzel fondue is my favorite dish there. lol  Cheese and the pretzel balls work so well here.  \"Ma..the Meatloaf!\" (what's she doing back there?) might be the only meatloaf I'll order in a restaurant.  Strong statement from a guy who's not into meatloaf. The pub burger and the BBQ Pork belly nachos are solid choices while drinking.  Speaking of booze, beer cans are mainly in the $6-$7 range with some great craft choices.  Tap beer rotation seems to be your mainstream IPAs, Guinness, and Bud Light  Value: Culinary dropout cuisine is a mixture of bougie bar food and some legit main entrees.  The pricing is fair as the quality of the ingredients and preparation is very good.  It can add up quickly if you're hitting up multiple dishes, but I'm usually here for the pretzels, beer and maybe another dish.  With that, I feel like I get a good experience for the price.  Ambiance: Dimly Lit at night with open room seating keeps it intimate as the tables are spaced apart perfectly for your privacy.  I've come across some live acoustic guitar on their mini stage which livens up the energy.  It's just a little too loud and is almost drowns out conversation at the table and it's another reason I sit at the bar which is furthest away from the stage.  Culinary Dropout is a great place to pre-game with your friends before a night out on a town or just a night out for a casual dinner and drinks.  Located in the Hard Rock Hotel, it's usually where I stop by before a concert there or before a night out close to the strip.  Location convenience and the consistently good service and food makes it a great joint that I can rely on  Enjoy!",

I do recommend it with NO SUGAR GLAZE though, I mean that is really subjective but I hate sugar coating and I think that brings out the apple flavor more.",

Our waitress was super nice and attentive. I can't remember her name as I'm writing this 3 weeks later. The charcuterie was awesome and what made it more enjoyable is that it's customizable. You can choose the meats, cheeses, and sides that are all a part of it.  We also ordered the fried chicken, corn ravioli, sliders, and pork ribs. Everything tasted great but it was a lot of food.  We didn't have any room for dessert but took a monkey bread home. Upon returning to Cali, we all took a bite and agreed that it was also very very good.  But my favorite thing at this place would be the pretzel fondue. The bread is so soft and pretzel-y and the cheese is so good!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Definitely a must get here.",

There was a very small dinner crowd there at 5:30, which was a relief, as this was our pre Magic Mike Live! dinner & drinks soiree. The patio is a great use of space, and the view of the pool is nice.  Oh and the $2.95 mystery beer in a paper bag is always the first thing I order. That was fun! I've heard that they once had a 32 ounce paper bag mystery beer, which blew my mind! You bargain hungry drinkers are with me on this. No 32 ouncer this time, just the expected Busch light!  The menu has some upscalish choices as well as some usual pub type fare. I had the reuben, which was pretty tasty and a good sized portion. Everyone was mostly happy with their appetizers and meals. I tried a friend's teriyaki chicken wings, and it was excellent! Drink prices are a little steep, as to be expected.  We had to wait too long to pay and have our checks returned. That probably won't keep me from coming back, but it's something to consider.",

My party had several appetizers and each one was distinct and delicious. The soft pretzels were actually delectable pretzel rolls served with a warm cheese. The Brussel sprouts were the best I have ever had, and the brussel sprout sauce was even better when sopped up with a soft pretzel. The beets and goat cheese were fantastic as well.   For an entree I had the turkey sandwich. It was very good, but to be fair, I was so full on appetizers that I could barely concentrate on me entree.   Other things to note were that the drinks were awesome, and our waiter, Sean I believe was his name, was super attentive and knowledgeable.   The whole meal was a wonderful experience beginning to end.",

    "text": "My husband and I came here for lunch as part of Restaurant Week and enjoyed our lunch.   At noon on a Saturday we were seated without delay in the large restaurant. Our friendly, attentive waitress was right over to get our orders started.   I started with Soft Pretzels and Provolone Fondue which were delicious. The pretzels were indeed soft and the cheese was tasty. The Italian Chopped Salad was also delicious and a generous portion. There was a great variety of meats and vegetables in the salad with couscous that added a little something to the salad. The Italian dressing was good and not too heavy. My Chocolate S'mores Pudding was an excellent ending to the meal. The melted marshmallow on top of the chocolate pudding would be delicious enough, but the grahams for dipping made it perfect. Overall, I was very happy with every part of my lunch.  My husband started with a House Salad that was fine and then The Pub Burger that he really enjoyed. The fries on the side were crispy and delicious. His Banana Creme Pie was a pop of banana flavor and delicious.  The only things I didn't love about the restaurant was that despite an entire wall being windows the restaurant was very dark. They could definitely benefit from more lighting as ambiance lifter. At the risk of sounding old, the music was far too loud for the middle of the day. It wasn't a big deal for a party of two, but in a group conversation would be limited to only the person next to you. Other than those small things I think Culinary Dropout is a good spot to grab a meal or drinks and appetizers.",

    "text": "Ok.. I have stayed at the hard rock a couple times but had kept missing their happy hour. So in December, we finally made our way in...and it was really great minus one hiccup.  I was coming off a diet with no bread so the decision was that any bread I had needed to be stellar!!! My gf I was visiting was very whatever about the famous pretzel fondue I told her about but once we got it, she was super happy lol! Who doesn't like cheese and bread? It. It for the vegan and gluten free for sure. We also ordered a round of cocktails and the pork belly nachos. Most of my friends are pork belly crazy but I am not, that said, these were great.   Because they were slow and we wanted to visit, we did ask to sit at a table. I also have a leg injury I am rehabbing so long sits at a bar can be annoying. Some places can get a real attitude but they accommodated. Our server was great and that was before she gave us some extra cheese to take home with our extra pretzels we weren't able to finish. This was great because my gf's kids got to try it out and they were in love....super special and unexpected.   The only blemish of the stay that keeps it from being 5 Star was an expediter/other server- the fit lumberjack type white guy with a beard, made a snide comment about the quantity of food we had when he dropped off a plate. 2 plus size women with two appetizers as our meal didn't appreciate it...",

    "text": "I came here on a Saturday night back in November with my siblings.  There was a live band playing some good throwback songs, like \"Santeria\". But it was difficult to have a conversation with the person next to me because of how loud it was. It only lasted about the first 20ish minutes that we were there.  Our server's name was Jess or Jessie (I think) and she was great. She made sure we got everything we asked for. She provided us with useful information about the menu items when we asked. She had a very bubbly personality. Just great service from her.  As an appetizer, we shared pretzel bites with the provolone fondue. The pretzels seemed too salty for my tastes, but once it was dipped in the cheese...it was AMAZING. We considered asking for another order of this once we realized how quickly we devoured them.  I ordered the fried chicken, which came with mashed potatoes, cole slaw, and a biscuit. But I substituted the cole slaw for an extra biscuit. I wasn't expecting the fried chicken to be so damn good! Seriously, it was the best fried chicken I've ever had in my life. It was crispy and I don't know what kind of magical batter they used on the chicken, but it was just perfect. I wasn't a fan of the mashed potatoes. The biscuits were so good. They were soft and the honey on top just made it that much better.  For dessert, I had the salted caramel custard. And it had caramel popcorn on top. I'm obsessed with salted caramel desserts and this one is HIGH on my list. It wasn't too sweet. And the popcorn on top was probably what made it so delicious. Not only did it taste good, but it gave a nice crunch to this dessert.",

Okay, we had the fried chicken. The chicken was wonderful, juicy on the inside and crispy on the outside. I think the gravy needed some work. We also had the Charred broccoli with red chili oil, the Korean-style brussels sprouts, and a cheese plate.  All were very tasty. I especially liked the brussel sprouts. Someone called them \"Addictive.\" I concur. We continued our pig-out with the SOFT PRETZELS & PROVOLONE FONDUE (forgive me for I copy and paste). This was decadent. I had the Room Service cocktail. It was expensive, but I loved it. I think $7 would be an adequate price, but then again, I'm cheap. We topped everything off with the Monkey Bread. It was gooey and good.  Quite frankly, this is a fun place. We will be back to try more of the food and drink. You have so many choices in Vegas. You should make this place one of them.",

    "text": "We were wandering around the Hard Rock Hotel (where we were staying) looking for something to eat that didn't require us to get in our car and drive somewhere since we had an event that we needed to attend later that evening.  We stumbled upon Culinary Dropout.  The place looks really cool, and as we walked in we could hear live jazz music playing.  As we walked into the dimly lit restaurant, we could see that there were plenty of tables, inside and out, and there was a cute little oyster bar on one side.  Although there were a ton of open tables closer to the action (music, bar, etc), we were seated in a back corner by another entrance.  It was dark in there, we couldn't tell who the servers were, and it took a while before anyone approached us for drink orders.  I tried to remain calm, since I was starting to get hangry.   Finally a friendly young gentleman approached our table and took our drink orders.  Overall, everything was pretty slow here.  Our drinks took a while to come out, it took a while to give our server the food orders, and it took a long while for our food to finally come out.  It was a little disconcerting, since it wasn't busy in the restaurant at all.  I usually give free passes when the place is swarming with people and the servers are running around like chickens with their heads cut off.    On to the food, I had the Prime Rib Dip.  It was ok, nothing mind-blowing.  The meat was tender, but tasted slightly over-seasoned, and the au jus was bland.  Weird combination, but I guess it balanced itself out.  My friend had the steamed mussels, and those were actually very good.  The flavor was really good, and the broth was sweet.  It was also a very nice portion.  I also got to try my boyfriend's entree, he had the meatloaf.  It looked like homemade meatloaf covered in ketchup or some kind of red sauce.  It was a bit on the dry side, but the sauce helped.    Overall, the food wasn't anything memorable and I probably wouldn't go out of my way the next time I'm in Vegas to eat here.  It was convenient, since we were staying in the hotel, but by no means was it a quick meal.",

Great since the fried chicken is made to order but worth the wait. When the plate arrived, the chicken was juicy and like homemade. The mashed potatoes were excellent. A bigger portion would've really cost me my diet 'cheat day'.  My husband ordered the Bistro Steak.  Very good and perfectly medium. Cooked through nicely, not over done.   Definitely want to come back again. Maybe a bit earlier to hear that he live music. Unfortunately by the time we were seated at 10:30, the musicians were packing up.",

I've been coming to Hard Rock for 10 years and this place flat out kills it. Delicious, well-prepared, fresh, tasty food with a wide variety of menu items. It can be kind of a pain to hop in a cab every time you want to eat a meal, but now you don't need to.  Breakfast, lunch, dinner, any of those will be delicious.  The fried chicken is awesome, as is the kale salad with crispy shrimp.  Service is great, too.",

We were told their Pub Burger was the best so all of us ordered that as our dish. The burger was good, not the best I have had. It comes with Havarti cheese, bacon and BBQ sauce. Two of the burgers were not cooked right so we had to send them back to re-cook which was disappointing. The service was great; our waiter was really cool about re-cooking the burgers and was very attentive to our needs. It's a little bit on the pricey side, $15 for a burger is high in my opinion. It's a great place if you are looking for bar food and convenience if you are staying at Hard Rock hotel.",

The food is consistently top quality but the prices are much less than you would pay in fancier establishments.

In addition to all the amazing food and staff it was my birthday and once again they made me feel like I was definitely celebrating at home!  Here is to team Kate and Ben!

    "text": "What a bummer.  Culinary Dropout was one of the restaurants I was most excited about for our trip to Vegas.  The pictures and reviews made this place sound amazing.   Unfortunately, we had a disappointing visit.  First of all, a large group had reserved space near the patio and the patio itself was full, so we were stuck in the front of the restaurant which feels completely removed from the fun.  Next, our server was a victim of a surprise rush and was completely overwhelmed, causing slow service, mistakes in our orders, and constantly being reminded how \"crazy it is in here tonight\". The food itself fell short too.  My wife and I ordered salads that didn't actually get served with the ingredients listed on the menu.  Her Caesar salad was supposed to include kale and my salad was supposed to include avocado (neither made it our our dishes).  One of the most anticipated parts of the meal was the pretzel/provolone app - unfortunately, the pretzels were overdone.  Big time bummer because I think if outside seating would've been available and the place was properly staffed, we could've overlooked the food shortcomings and had a good time.",

When you first get into Culinary Dropout, you find a pretty spacious restaurant surprisingly after you enter.  Their bar/beer draft selection is also pretty plentiful with PBR, Fat Tire and more.  I had the meatloaf which was recommended by a couple Yelpers - not a bad choice as it was of a pretty good size but not the best.  Some of my coworkers had the burgers which were fantastic according to them.  The cannelloi was also supposed to be pretty good but be warned, it was pretty small and not filling.    There was also a pretty good live musician playing on the front stage - the poor guy was playing to a 1/2-empty restaurant on a Sunday night but hey, still did a good job playing in general.    The aesthetic was pretty nice with a full bar and bar seating, some nice tables and some other seats scattered about.  Don't expect for quiet conversation inside as the music is put up pretty loud.  There were also some cool fire pits right outside - wasn't sure if it was part of the restaurant but seemed nice if you wanted to go outside or have a nice moment with your significant other.    Culinary Dropout wasn't completely wow-worthy but all-around was a strong restaurant in it's food, aesthetics and cool little bonuses.  Kudos.",

If you are entering the casino it's tucked away just off the casino floor over looking the Paradise pool area. We went on a fabulous weather day in Vegas. Low 80's with a breeze. We sat inside because well who wants body sweat and suntan oil smell seeping into your lunch?   Decent fat friendly seating.   We came with zero knowledge or expectations other than what we saw on the back of the cab.   Nice surprise!   The best part was the Service. extremely nice hostess, waiters etc. constantly there just in time to refill the drinks or see if we needed anything.   Cocktails: My bloody Mary was hand made. Nicely prepared with bacon, cucumber garnish. Decent selection of beers both foreign and domestic.   BEST PART of Food: a do it yourself antipasta bar - & raw bar. Huge selection of meats, cheese & veggies plus shrimp, crab legs oysters etc. (only one of us is not allergic to shell fish). I would go just for this. BUT   They have mini grilled cheese sandwiches. and fall off the bone ribs and yummy close to mama used to make meat loaf.   As a local to Las Vegas, we usually only go to casinos on or close to the strip when we have company or clients in Vegas but we have gone back twice just to go to Culinary Dropout. Worth the $5.00 to the valet to park.   Oh and the pool eyecandy was nice too. No speedos to be seen.",

Since I was dining with my imaginary friends, we headed over to the bar area to cause a ruckus. I ordered the Turkey Pastrami sandwich w/ side salad, based on the bartender's recommendation.   As I was waiting, I people watched the hordes of tatted up, juiceheads and guidos running around half naked .My in-dining entertainment, included a patron who lined up a shot of vodka, the $4 pineapple mind eraser special, a Pabst Blue Ribbon, and a glass of wine and pounded all 4 drinks within a minute. Super classy.  The food arrived fairly quickly. The sandwich was served with a warm pretzel roll, with generous slices of turkey pastrami, swiss cheese, and smothered with cole slaw.  The sandwich was okay. Pretty messy to eat and it didn't have a wow-factor. The salad was just average too. Chilled romaine lettuce, bits of cucumber, and covered with a watery buttermilk ranch dressing. The menu, including water, came out to be a whoppin' $18 dollars with tip.   The bartenders were friendly and was very prompted in serving us. I took a look at the drink menu prices, and we took our party elsewhere.   A little about my credentials: I first got into cooking & food when I was in college. After being rejected by numerous girls and getting zero action, I decided it was time for a change. I needed a new makeover to boost my geeky image. I applied for a cooking position at a Mediterranean-Italian Restaurant near my home and learned to cook all sorts of dishes. I never became a professional chef, but I continue to enjoy & love food. 9 years later and 55 lbs heavier, I have a new passion for traveling and trying different foods around the world.",

I don't know what I expected, but their oysters weren't good, they were great.  I ordered the Chicken Curry with potato, green beans, peanuts, mushrooms, lime & cilantro.

    "text": "We were so excited to try this place out.  Unfortunately, it did not live up to its 4 star yelp rating.  We dined on a Wed night- very slow.    There was a group of 9 men at a hi-top that was being waited on by our server.  We were also a 9 top.  Our initial greeting by our server was great, but after that it all went rolling down hill.    Service was horrible.  Drinks took forever.  Thank goodness we ordered the pretzel fondue and chips to start.  Food was ok.  Nothing to die or fondle over.  Our server took over 30 min to take our dinner order and we made it easy for her, as we ordered everything to share.    The worst part was the entrees- it took over 45 min to get our entrees and when it came, It was stone cold.  Our ribeye was seriously COLD!  Obviously they tried to put up all 9 entrees at once,but could not keep everything hot.  Very, Very Poor!  1/2 of the entrees were COLD and the other 1/2 was Luke Warm.    At this point we were truly disappointed, but we are not complainers.   Our belief is, we just won't come back.  We still wanted to believe in this place and ordered dessert to see if this place would redeem itself.  Unfortunately, it got a little better with dessert but not service.    The Monkey Bread was a 7 on a scale of 1-10 and the Salted Carmel Pudding was an 8.  That was the hi light of the meal, sad to say.    Service overall was poor.  Our server was non-efficient and non-existent and it was super SLOW!  No excuses when you are the servers ONLY table!    $500 later and it was the WORST meal we had all week!  Yelpers beware of this joint.  Don't dine on a slow night.  Mediocre food and terrible service.",

The first was for beers (a good selection) and enjoyed the artichoke (if a bit watery) and the soft pretzels bites with (really thin) provolone fondue.   The second time was for bunch on a Sunday.  Service was super slow and forgetful. The worst part was the biscuits and sausage gravy.  It was tomato-y.  TOMATO.  I just... *shivers* I don't want to talk about it.

    "text": "A few friends came in town last night who were staying at the Hard Rock so I immediately said, let's try Culinary Dropout. I had heard so many things about this place that I thought it would be great. Maybe I had too many expectations but then again, it is the Strip so I should have high expectations.   I got there a little bit before my friends and thought I would stop by the bar and grab a drink. I asked for a Menu and was only given the dinner menu. It was 5:30 and I had thought there was a Happy Hour but of course, that wasn't mentioned AT ALL since we all know the only important thing is to rip off tourists. Nice job there bartender chic. Now that I'm sitting at home, I check your website and find out that yeah, you kinda ripped me off. Nice. To add insult to injury the drink I did order wasn't what was on the menu. Yes she said that they were out of one of the ingredients, but I really question WHY? This is Las Vegas. THIS IS THE STRIP. You shouldn't be \"out\" of anything.   My friends get there and we are seated outside, which was kinda nice. It was a pretty night in Las Vegas so it was nice to enjoy the weather and chat. Someone comes over and drops off what looks a lot like a sushi menu, but it was for their antipasti and appetizers. No one really said anything about it, because you know, it's normal to get a sheet of paper and a pencil to order your food??? My friend order some asparagus, which btw, never came. Let me point out that we ordered that and drinks then waited a little bit to order food, so how asparagus can't make it to the table is a bit confusing to me.   I must remark on the server. Seriously hipster dude comes over and does the lame, \"Have you been here before.\" Servers need to stop that. Especially at Strip restaurants since well, IT'S A TOURIST SPOT. Unless you are going to conduct a game show to enable food ordering, I'm pretty sure I don't need this lame spiel about your restaurant and menu. I can read English and have never had a major mishap ordering dinner before. I know. Amazing as that sounds. I also don't need this dude to tell me how they were rated a top new restaurant by US Weekly or some such nonsense. If the food and restaurant are great then I'll know that when I leave. Let it stand on its own merits not some pseudo hype that you want to use to \"impress\" us silly tourists.   We ordered our food and enjoyed conversation. It took a little longer than I would expected for fried food and a salad in a not-at-all full restaurant. My salad was good but it wasn't anything that jumped out in my mind. My girlfriend got the fried chicken. She said it was ok. Seeing that we're from Mississippi, we kinda know our fried chicken. She also commented on how it was WAY too sweet as well as the cornbread was WAY too sweet. Not shocking. This place is like all these other \"trendy\" restaurant popping up that have \"Southern\" food on their menu that they charge way too much for. They have no one in the back who can find the South on a map, let alone know how to cook food properly. They've just watched one too many episodes of Paula Dean and now think they now. Meh  We got our bill and handed the server my debit card and told him that I had the ONE drink and ONE salad. The rest was to be taken from the Hundred that my friends handed him. SEVERAL SEVERAL SEVERAL minutes later he comes back and asks them if they needed change. WHAT?!?! Just run my card and bring it as well as their change back and let them look it over. My friend replies, \"Well I don't even know how much it was since you needed to run her card.\" He IMMEDIATELY tells (not bring a check or anything) her the total and then just kinda stands there. It was a weird, and unnecessary, few moments. My friend replies, \"No just keep the change but bring her her credit card.\" He quickly runs over and runs my card and brings my receipt.  That is a tacky and pushy way to get your tip dude. Seriously. I can't believe that a server would ever do that to someone. I've worked in plenty of restaurants and a few here in Las Vegas and the only time I would say anything to that affect is if I had just that second picked up the check, not when  I've walked away and made calculations that amount to me assuming I deserve what's left over. It was a HUGE turn off on top of many turn offs.   All in all I was very under impressed after all the hype I'd heard. I see absolutely no reason to ever go back there again. I definitely won't be recommending it and I have friends come in town ALL THE TIME. I'd give it one star but the atmosphere was kinda nice and I liked the patio. Though neither of those were great enough to get to go have mediocre food and get ripped off on drinks. I hope everyone else has a better experience than I do. For me I can think of dozens of restaurants in Las Vegas I'd rather go to. Heck, I would have been MUCH happier at Firefly down the road. Sigh...lesson learned",

    "text": "Check out their happy hour. Monday through Friday, from 3-6, it includes $3-6 snacks, as well as $3 PBR mugs, $4 well cocktails, and $6 mystery shot and beer.  I stuck with the wells, but they were well made and you can get them with their house-made lemonade.  We sampled the meatloaf sandwich and cheese sliders (both $6) and the house-made chips and onion dip ($3).  The portions are great (regular sized meatloaf and three mini grilled cheese sandwiches); these were delicious. The grilled cheese were perfectly golden and melted and the meatloaf was tender with a great sauce. I loved the homemade onion dip---yum!  The pretzel bites looked good and came in a generous quantity, and the antipasto platter also looked good, but alas, we were too full from our hearty snacks.  Great open floor plan lets you see the kitchen, the bar, and out to the patio/pool (it was closed on the December evening when we were there). Service was great, and although it was a Friday evening at 5 pm, with a Bowl Game in town, we were able to be seated immediately.  I wish that I would have gone on earlier in the week (so I could go back several times during my trips.",

They could have been cleaned a bit better, I had more than a few with some serious grit in them. And I know there's always going to be SOME grit and sand, but this probably could have been remedied with another rinse or two. Good sauce accompanies it, though. Just be conservative with it, the oysters taste delicious on their own.   I had the meatloaf. It didn't taste as good as my mom's (but, really, does it ever, people?) but it was actually better than I was expecting. A solid, well-formed loaf, not too spongy, nice firmness. Seasoning was mild, not too heavy as to take away the taste of the meat.   It came with green beans, which were extremely underdone. Better than overdone, but I found it odd they'd serve them like that; didn't complement the dish at all. I think it also came with mashed potatoes. The fact I can't remember likely means the other side dish was innocuous enough that it went down good but wasn't worth storing in my mind.",

Oh Culinary Dropout you are bad, very very bad!!! I was staying at the HRH on business and happened to stumble on this place and I'm so glad I did. I don't know if it was one too many vodka whatevers but everything tasted so good. Culinary Dropout you had me at provolone fondu! We started with pretzel and the very good cheese fondu and went to appetizer heaven from there. Next was fries and the homemade chips. Fried were perfectly crisp and the dip for the crunchy potato chips was definitely craveable. Next king crab legs, dozen oysters and huge monster shrimp. The oysters were beyond fresh, I mean it was like someone just dove into the ocean shucked them and brought them to us. Not to big but perfect to enjoy. The crab legs were obese with meat and equally fresh and good. The shrimp were so big that one was equivalent to other restaurants cocktail. Again equally fresh and so yummy. Next not the table was fresh French fries. I know what your thinking, Felicia, you already mentioned you had fries. Well guess what we ordered more!! Pigs, we were pigs!! Lastly, the monkey bread and vanilla bean ice cream. Words cannot do justice to this gooey, cinnamony, pillowy soft pull apart desert demon!! The ice cream was just icing. We didn't even get to any of the main courses so I will definitely be back but it will be so very hard not to order the exact same things. Service was awesome but to be honest the server could have slapped me and I would not have noticed with all of the goods!! You make me proud Culinary Dropout. Oh just in case you were wondering this place is way casual so don't worry about dressing up too much. Enjoy!",

My sister and I went and had our usual sister lunch which ended up turning into a tab of 20.00 for food and 140.00 for drinks because they were just so good! We both had a salad, I had the salad with fried shrimp and it was good! I know that my sister enjoyed hers as well. Our waitress was great and drinks came fast. We must have had at least 5 to 6 different one's and ordered off our waitresses opinion. Every drink was delicious. The setup is cool. Every table is different nothing super fancy and matching but cute. Had a great view of the pool at the hotel. Couches and huge relaxing chairs in the sun or couches in the shade. Great place to come for lunch and will definitely have to come back for brunch which is supposed to be great on Sunday's!",

Add this all up to include a cheerful & competent wait staff and bartenders.....ding ding ding!!  We have ourselves a winner folks!  Others have spoke about the awesome happy hour specials so there's nothing more I can add to what's been said already.  Speaking of the bartenders, Jamie was very attentive and knowledgeable about the various drinks to choose from. She is the best of an already good group.  Her pleasant and happy demeanor made a good place that much better.  Needless to say, anytime I'm back in Las Vegas, a visit to CD will be on my agenda!",

Our server, Ben I think, was really awesome, super attentive, and really helpful with giving us ideas of places to check out! They have a nice range of food, from fried chicken to salads. I had the butternut squash and kale salad with salmon, which was deeeeeelicious! The best part was that it wasn't sopping in dressing like you normally get. Also, they make the best moscow mules! My favorite drink! The prices are also very reasonable, but the drinks are standard around 12+ per cocktail. The atmosphere is cool, they usually have someone playing live music up on stage, and right outside they have fire pits and couches where you can sit and relax. Would definitely come back here. Actually, I did, I went twice during my stay.",

LOTS of avocado and the wasbai peas were a little kick of surprise.  The next time I went I got a sandwich (pastrami I think?) and it was on a pretzel roll.  I just remember the damn delicious pretzel roll.  They have this fondue that looks scrumptious, but I've never gotten it because I think I would just eat the cheese with a spoon and people might judge me for that, you know?

After checking into the hotel we had lunch here at the bar. We got beers and the pretzel fondue. Delicious! Then we came back for Happy Hour at the bar as well. Great deals!!! We got more beers and grilled cheese sliders. Also yummy! The atmosphere is really fun and laid back. Their wait staff and bartenders don't wear uniforms so it's kind of funny seeing them serve people in regular clothes. I have an obsession with outdoor seating - this place has a great patio with couches and firepits that overlook the Hard Rock's pool area. Great find on our last day in vegas!",

I got my food to go, was sent to the bar to order it, and was greeted and had my order taken immediately. BUT, after sitting with an empty glass for at least five minutes, I had to wave to get the attention of the bartender who was standing right in front of me but staring off into the distance. When my food was delivered to the bar, it sat right behind the beer taps for at least 5 to 10 minutes, while the bartenders were serving using those taps, until someone finally got it for me and I wasn't even offered a to-go cup for my iced tea. I assume because I wasn't wearing a skimpy bikini, I was just invisible. These guys certainly didn't deserve the nice tip I gave them.",

Interesting menu with astonishing variety, quality ingredients and genuinely creative approach. My table shared the mussels and burrata pear thingy for apps, then I had the chicken curry while others had the ribs, the burger and the ribeye. Everything was great, and no pricier than any other gastropub in a Strip hotel.   The atmosphere is a bit on the douchey side. It's REALLY loud, and opens out onto the epicenter of the douchiverse, the Hard Rock pool. The waitstaff are all waaaay too cool for school; apparently, the shtick is that there are no uniforms; they can wear whatever they want..which means trendy-slutty apres-pool attire for the ladies, and hipster-douche chic for the dudes. The service was OK; it was really busy (right before the Def Leppard show) so I'll cut 'em some slack for the lackluster nature.  I'd come here again, but on a slow night. I like to TALK over my meals, and it was just too freaking loud.",

Culinary Dropout fits in nicely between the ultra casual Lucky's 24/7 Diner and the much higher end NOBU and 35 Steaks and Martini on the HR property. Culinary Dropout is more what I would describe as comfort food, they have a pretty decent menu that should suit most. Some freinds and I dropped in for a bite and ate outside poolside for lunch one afternoon. I went with an order of the hot pretzels with fondue dips and a turkey reuben, both were delish. Service was good too, I have no real complaints and would recommend this place to fellow Yelpers and freinds in a heart beat.",

    "text": "I've never been a huge fan of the Hard Rock's dining options in the past.  I don't necessarily dislike any of them, but other than Nobu none of them have ever struck a chord with me and made me want to do several repeat visits or instilled any sort of cravings deep within, and I can't really afford to blow half a paycheck on sushi on a whim so half the time I end up down the street at Firefly before a concert.    In planning to see Fiona Apple last night I was excited to try Culinary Dropout from it's positive reviews and creative menu.  Upon arrival I stupidly hadn't thought to make reservations and there was a 45 minute wait.   The hostesses were kind enough to let us know that bar seating was available and we had a seat long these long wooden tables with stools.  I found them comfortable as far as stools go (I typically prefer backs and armrests on chairs #chairsnob), my dining partner that evening found them uncomfortable as the feet rests near the bottom of the stool were set too low for her shorter legs.  The pains of being less than 6 feet tall I guess.    We started by ordering some small plates of cured olives and grilled asparagus, as well as some jack and cokes (though some of the custom made cocktails sounded delicious, I'm generally opposed to spending $12 per drink unless it's a last resort or I'm only planning on having 1 or 2, which is pretty much never).   The olives were as expected, and the grilled asparagus which was served chilled with sea salt were very tasty and worth the $4.  Our first order of jack and cokes arrived with what seemed like nearly flat coke.  I'm not one for complaining unless something is egregious so we sucked them up literally and figuratively and let the waitress know for our second order and she very nicely and graciously went to the 2nd bar area for the next round and they were fine (and strong!)    For entrees I tried the Pork Cubano sandwich which comes with a side of fries.  My companion ordered the Bistro steak.  Upon arrival I was a little disappointed in the look of both meals.  The steak was quite possibly the smallest steak I'd ever seen on a plate, though to be fair my companion was fine with the size and didn't even finish it (note:  women.  smh) The cuban was on some sort of regular sliced bread and not on a roll of cuban bread as I expected.  That chapter on cubans must have been after the drop date.  The usage of pork belly instead of a typical sliced ham was interesting, and the flavor of the meat itself and the melted swiss was good, but I did expect more out of it upon ordering.   I thought the pickles were too much on the sweet side and I prefer a more sour pickle with a cuban.  The fries were pretty standard, and the sea salt helped those out tremendously (as sea salt tends to do).  Naturally I cleaned my plate despite any flaws, so it wasn't bad, just slightly disappointing.  On an extremely positive note, our server (Dominique?  That's what the receipt says for Cashier) was fantastic.  Eager to explain the menu, checked on us throughout the meal and was efficient throughout.    Next time I'd definitely try the Pretzel Bites and a specialty cocktail (or 3), but for now the Hard Rock dining legacy continues for me.",

We were very well taken care of and I appreciate that my negative experience was important enough to them that they would bring me back to take another crack at it.  Great service ..the chef even personally delivered our meals (we all had salads).    The food today was also excellent.  We had the gorgonzola chicken salad and the crispy shrimp caesar.  Both very flavorful.  We also tried the pretzel bread and fondue ...might be one of the best appetizers I've ever had.  The bread, by itself is great and ..of course ..most things taste better dipped in cheese.  So bravo to culinary dropout ...I am willing to go back there just for the pretzel bread ..but I am also anxious to see how the service is when my meal isn't being comped ..but they earned another shot ..so we'll see.",

    "text": "This has become a regular spot of mine for the past year and for multiple reasons. The atmosphere is unique with a touch of hipster mixed with a touch of rock n roll. The servers do not have uniforms which helps to give that impression of a casual setting. There is an inside and an outside seating area and a full bar with super strong drinks and an honest selection of beers. All of that is great but isn't the real reason the place marks my top 10 list in Vegas, it's the food. If you go here for no other reason than to eat pretzels, you will still leave satisfied. The pretzels are bite-sized pieces (although tough to get in one bite) with an amazing provolone cheese fondue.  I have tried most dishes on the menu and none of them disappoint. This is also a great first date place where you can get a meat/cheese plate with a glass of wine and not have to worry about what side of the plate to sit your fork. Excellent.",

    "text": "ok, I seriously hate sharing really good secrets for fear that they will switch it up and do away with my secret place, however we have been going here about once a week for the past two months.   They have happy hour m-f 3-6 and while yes, the signature pretzel rolls are amazing, they give you a lot...why is this a problem...because the rest of the food is just that good too.  My husband always insists on having the meatloaf sandwich, so we forgo the pretzels most of the time now.  I always have to get the antipasta plate.  Usually pretty consistently the same, but they switch the cheeses out or the nuts out for a different flavor.  This is my favorite meal anyway, so very happy to get it for such a great deal.  And you'd think that since we go in for the cheap happy hour deals that the staff would be snooty...never once.  Oh and I forgot the fries...so good.  Actually much of their menu looks worth trying, but this stuff is so good that we don't want to try anything else.  So I am sharing my secret because they are usually a little slow...yes, we are there at their slow time, so I hope that they get enough party business to stay open....they are really good and really the menu prices are pretty decent for the location.    So now that I wrote a review about your awesome happy hour, please do not change it :)  Update....this is still my favorite happy hour, but we did try the fried chicken, however I am a connoisseur of fried chicken and it didn't change my world....however I wanted to tell the manager to please be sure to take off the horrible instant mashed potatoes...if they don't want to make them, serving fries is perfectly acceptable w fried chicken.  Have also tried the chicken club sandwich now and while good, it is not as good as the meatloaf sandwich.    Servers are always so super nice and attentive.",

The service was outstanding and the food was all good... wife had the fried chicken, which she loved.  Our entire party shared food with each other and we all agreed all were a hit. Perhaps the only drawback for some in our party was that the Hard Rock pool is adjacent and the pounding house/trance music was an irritant.  I, myself, actually enjoyed it, though. Nothing like bouncing in your seat while drinking a good drink, eating some tasty food, and watching the pool patrons do their thing.",

    "text": "Culinary Dropout is in the Hard Rock Hotel. My GF and I went there on a whim today for some lunch. We were not dressed up and we were hungover, but we decided to go in anyway. My brother frequents this place in Arizona, so we had some ideas about what to order. We started out with the pretzel bites with provolone cheese fondue. I highly recommend this appetizer, the only downside is that I filled up and could not finish my pub burger. The burger was exactly what I was looking for, gastropub style with lots of flavor. I was sad that I could not finish it. My GF got the breakfast burrito, which was fantastic. For drinks I had The After School Special. Thumbs up in my book. The girlfriend had the bottomless mimosas, can't go wrong there. We had our service dog with us, the staff was more than friendly with him being with us ( I know it's a law that an establishment can't discriminate, but trust me, it happens) We sat on the patio and had our drinks while watching the staff shave their Mo-vember mustaches off. Great people watching. Our waiter Shaun, was not only a great server, but a great human being. He talked with us for a long time and made us feel right at home. I really liked this place and will be back. Next time you are at Hard Rock, skip the gross restaurant Pink Taco, and head into Culinary Dropout. Look for the tattooed server named Shaun, you won't be disappointed.",

The hostess seated me next to the kitchen But the waiter never came over to offer a drink or take my order.  I tried to get his attention, he looked at me several times but -- nothing.  He had a large party that had people joining randomly and so I wanted to give the guy the benefit of the doubt.  However, 10 minutes later, a couple was seated.  The waiter was there within a couple of minutes and took a drink order.  I tried to get his attention again -- nothing.   I also tried to get the attention of a man in a Chef's outfit who was oblivious to my attempts.  I decided to wait just a bit longer and see what would happen.  He brought their drinks and took their dinner order and I still couldn't get his attention.  I also tried to get the attention of a man in a Chef's outfit who was oblivious to my attempts.  So I walked out and let the receptionist know who didn't seem concerned.  Even if someone is waiting on another person even a bad waiter knows to get the person a drink.  So I went to the Pink Taco (in the complex) and the Waiter and Bartender were SO nice.  I was served in record time and the food was really good.",

    "text": "This is my latest favorite place in Vegas, and I definitely want to go again. First, it's off the Strip at the Hard Rock, but it's worth the adventure to get there. The best way I can describe it is as a classy Cracker Barrel -- but that's way underestimating it's goodness. The cocktails, mostly bourbon based, are homemade and distinct, and I particularly loved the bourbon with papaya juice, jalapeno and bitters. I am a southerner, so I'm a sucker for great fried chicken. I was told that I had to try it here, and I was not disappointed. The buttermilk crust was crunchy, thick and perfectly browned, and the meat very succulent and juicy. The fried chicken entree came with a very hefty 3 pieces, all sprinkled with honey. I would put it in my top 5 fried chicken list. I also enjoyed the French onion soup, though the very large piece crouton...really a slice of bread ... was a bit much for this low carb eater. The service was very friendly and attentive, and we had a great time. For those who prefer other things than fried chicken, the rest of the menu had very attractive comfort food options that ranged from fish, to meatloaf to chicken. Definitely a place I'll return when in Vegas.",

The Pumpkin ravioli was ridiculous in a really good way, the pretzels with cheese dip are addicting, ALL their Sandwiches.. ok ok you probably are now understanding how AMAZING this place is.  I think the only thing I didn't like was the music.. Rap/techno music playing way to loud... I looked around like.. umm rap/techno music at The Hard ROCK?  but it was some lame DJ probably from L.A.

We were really hankering for fried chicken, so I \"Yelp'ed\" fried chicken and this place popped up not too far of a trek from MGM Signature Hotel where we were staying. I have to tell you the atmosphere was so relaxed, we sat outside near the pool at Hard Rock Hotel and lounged on the couches. They even have a Beer Pong table! We ordered the delicious pretzel bites and cheese fondu, which was a hit! But I have to say the Fried Chicken, mashed potatoes and gravy was to die for! This is one of the best meals I have every had on my trips to Vegas - and the prices were so reasonable! I would recommend this spot to anyone looking for good drink prices and some comfort food! What an amazing place! Can't wait to go back to Vegas just to come here :)",

We first tried the Burrata, a cream infuse mozzarella with persimmon, brussels sprouts, hazelnuts, and grilled croutons. As if fresh mozzarella isn't creamy enough, this just melted in your mouth. The roasted hazelnuts and crispy brussels sprouts leaves brought a delightful texture to the party in my mouth.  Our second appetizer was their infamous  soft pretzels and provolone fondue.  Delicious is an understatement.  The pretzel knobs were soft and airy on the inside, with a soft, chewy, shimmery outside. And the fondue...OH THE FONDUE... The provolone fondue to the pretzel is like a micro fleece blanket and a wood fire to you and I.  Let's just say I'm on a mission to replicate the recipe.  For entree's, we ordered the goulash and jambalaya.  Sounds ordinary, but Culinary Dropout took it to the extraordinary.  The spices were BAM! spot on.  The portions, well worth it.  Who knew leftover jambalaya would be so good for breakfast?!  I do now. We ended the meal sharing the chocolate and peanut brittle tart, a rich chocolate gonosh in a flaky crust sprinkled with peanut brittle.  Delicious.  We will definitely find ourselves back there to  try other items on the menu and more pretzels and fondue.  Cannot wait.",

The food was really really good. We went back the morning of our checkout but misses breakfast so we didn't stay. But our second server was very courteous and understanding, she even have me coffee to go. We will definitely be back here anytime we go to Vegas, whether we stay at Hard Rock or not. The decor is like an industrial kitchen, open and comfortable. The patio is edged by the pool so all around the venue is fantastic.

    "text": "I was working at the Hard Rock Hotel for five days and ended up eating at almost every establishment there.  We had a celebratory cocktail party on the patio. They moved some of the furniture around to give us a private section. The waitresses were busy, but very nice.  I tried a few menu items (score out of 5): -Meats (prosciutto, capicola, salumi) 4 -Vegetables & Snacks (roasted asparagus, cured olives, roasted beets) 3 -Cheeses (I don't know which ones.) 3 -Chicken Meatballs 1 -Pub Burger 3  There were a few others, but I didn't get a chance to try them. Overall, I would say this is the second best restaurant at the Hard Rock Hotel, but that isn't saying very much. I still recommend going to a better place at another hotel if you can.",

I've eaten there quite a few times now and can honestly say that I've never had a bad dish  Pretzels & fondue: freshly baked pretzel bites with a provolone and fontina fondue are perfectly soft bites of ptrezel and gooey cheese.   Turkey Reuben: boyfriend loves this dish. In house smoked turkey pastrami, coleslaw, thousand island on fresh baked pretzel roll. The turkey is tender and perfectly smoked. The side of fries are decadent an perfectly salty.   Breakfast burrito: scrambled eggs (I opt for egg whites) sauteed pablano peppers, bacon and cheese wrapped in a soft flour tortilla and served with house potatoes. Very good, salsa on the side and the potatoes are delish!  Yogurt parfait: Greek vanilla yogurt, house made granola and fruit is a good light way to start the day.   Prime rib dip: tender prime rib, fontina cheese, horseradish and au jus served on a homemade French roll. Tender, succulent roast beef, literally melts in your mouth.   The bottomless mimosas on Saturdays & Sundays will start your day off right and their Moscow mules are light, crisp and refreshing.   Located in the middle of the hard rock, the urban decor, the service and the food will get your day rockin",

I ordered the fried chicken - now, I have to say, I am a Kentucky girl.  I know my fried chicken.  I haven't had awesome fried chicken since I moved out of Kentucky almost a year ago.  Culinary Dropout has ahhhhhmazing fried chicken.  The prices are a bit high, but the food is delicious.  My meal came with three pieces of chicken (a leg, breast & thigh), coleslaw, mashed potatoes & a honey biscuit - for $22.    The restaurant, itself is beautifully decorated.  There is an open patio section with cool fire pit tables.  (My description is terrible - go see for yourself!).  I'm a professional photographer & would looove to shoot inside this place.  It's so cool.  The staff was very nice and our waitress held herself together well when some douche grabbed her butt while she was taking his order.  For me, the music was a bit loud.  We could barely hear our friends talking, so it's not great for conversation.  & the only other downside is that it's in the Hard Rock, which is quite possibly the douchiest place in Las Vegas.  We dodged about 10 Bachelor parties and a gaggle of obnoxious drunk girls (at 5:30 in the afternoon - I know this is Vegas, but geez...at least wait until after dark to be so drunk you can't walk.) just getting to the actual restaurant.  Go.  Eat.  Dodge drunk guys.  Be happy.",

    "text": "I am so upset at my recent visit to your culinary dropout location here in Vegas! I had called around 530 to make a reservation because I had heard so many good things about your restaurant and read that you had great unique dishes! So I called and had my friend from out of town make a reservation for a party of 2 at 10 pm. I hadn't seen my friend in a while so I was really enthused to show him this amazing location inside of the Hard Rock. When we got there we were seated by someone that wasn't a host. I didn't get his name but I do remember that he walked us to our table. Before we were sat we made small talk with this gentleman and asked him if it was busy, he said that it was a slow day and then grabbed menus and walked further inside the restaurant. Halfway into the restaurant he asked us if we had preferred to sit outside and seemed very indecisive on where he was going to seat us even though there was plenty of tables with servers in their section to accommodate a measly party of 2. So he instead walked us outside where there were no tables and sat us near a fire pit. Since the outside tables weren't set up he moved a table and two chairs over from a different sections and sat us down. About 5 minutes later a server by the name of candy walked out and introduced herself. I had never been to this location so was interested in the menu, the ingredients and the favorite and best selling dishes. She said \"everything on this menu is surprisingly good\" that didn't sell me on anything so I told her that we would start off with two beers first and we would look over the appetizers. She smiled and walked into the restaurants. My friend and I started catching up and talking and within that time we noticed that she started going to other tables and putting dishes away and closing out people's tabs and completely ditching our table! Twenty minutes had gone by and I didn't get a drink and she didn't come back outside to check on our table. I was infuriated so I walked inside and looked everywhere for a manager! Everywhere I went and everyone I asked didn't seem to know where he was! So I patiently waited by the bar when suddenly candy made her way to me and said I am finally here do you want to be sat at the bar now? What can I get you? I was so mad that she hadn't even apologized or taken the amount of wasted time in to consideration. She had simply dismissed the idea that she had neglected our table and was polishing and putting things away because she wanted to close. Another 5 minutes later the general manager approached the bar and didn't introduce himself and all he said was I'm sorry that she dropped the ball I'll buy you guys drinks. His name was Danny I believe and he also didn't try to asses the situation or make it any better. 5 minutes later he had asked the bartender to give us a round of beers on the house and upon giving me my beer the server spilled the beer all over me and my belongings. So, not only did I waste my time by going to a place I thought was legit and amazing but I was sat outside at a dirty table neglected by a uninterested server and then I got a beer spilled all over me. The manager was the worst experience for me because he did ABSOLUTELY nothing to try to make the situation better. When he was talking to us he was distracted and uninterested in making things right. I am disappointed in the level of service and professionalism that this place offered and I will be telling everyone not to go there! Your company has been known to provide good services, and such events tarnish the company name, so please address this issue soon.",

The antipasti was a great surprise selection of some of their meats, cheeses and starters. I wish it had come out before the pretzels because I got too full on those. Overall both dishes and the drink were fantastic! The ambience is very low key and relaxing but the music is loud. The service is also slow. They pride themselves on making everything fresh and I understand fresh takes time. Just be prepared this is not the place to go in a rush or in a time frame. Great for a long, leisurely meal though.",

We ordered grilled asparagus- $4 for 5 wilted spears- that comes out to $1.25 a SPEAR. I ordered King Crab legs for dinner. They came on a plate of ice. They were only slightly cracked. I asked for crab leg crackers. The waitress said that they didn't have any. How was I supposed to eat my crab legs? She took them back and had them split again. Needless to say I ended up with crab meat in my hair, on my lap, and on the floor.  My bf had a burger that he compared to the average burger joint. The resurrection of the meal was the monkey bread. It was hot, moist, and delicious.",

For $7 I expected more chips that what we were served.  THE SHRIMP WERE NOT PEELED. Or De-veined.  (If you like your cocktail sauce on the spicy side, ask for some horseradish.)  And, there were no \"wet-naps\" or any way to wipe your hands after handling the shrimp, which lead to a trip to the restroom to wash my hands . . . but there isn't a restroom inside this restaurant.  You get sent to a bathroom in the casino that's a bit of a hike and hard to find, now that there's extra signage and stanchions/guest control in the casino for the Magic Mike show.    We ordered the fried chicken and corn ravioli entrees and our food was good.  We added chicken to the ravioli entree and it was just sliced chicken plopped on top if the pasta and not integrated into the dish in any way.  The fried chicken was good; there were three pieces (thigh, leg, breast) and even the white meat was cooked perfect.  This restaurant is open to the pool and has an outdoor patio with a few bar games.  People were loud, plus there were several TVs tuned to sports and then a female violin trio playing alternative covers started playing. They were very good but hard to hear.  And, there were several groups of bachelorettes in the restaurant that were loud; the Magic Mike show is bringing in these groups.    If I try this place again, will come for lunch or on a weeknight. Would love to try one of the sandwiches.  Next time.",

    "text": "It angers me to be so hyped up about a place and then have to give them such a low grade rating. Overrated, overpriced and under serviced would be the top 3 ways I could describe it. I was so stoked to try the new raw bar, fresh antipasta made in front of you, outdoor seating with firepits restaurant the Hard Rock was offering. Not to mention menu choices like beef stroganoff, ribs, fried chicken, and meatloaf. I for sure thought I would be in heaven.  Now let me start with the 2 good things about this place. 1- The ambiance. It was a huge indoor/outdoor 2 bars, view of the pool. AMAZING set up. If you sit indoors, you can watch them make your antipasti platter fresh in front of you which brings me to the the highlight of the meal 2- THE ANITPASTI! So it was for sure over priced. $8 per cured meat. $5 per cheese. $4 per snack (snacks included olives peppers, bread, etc) My super awesome platter cost $38. Sad that it was the only thing worth it. The meats were perfectly salted and the cheeses were imported. I would actually order this again if I wasn't worried about the cost.  Thats it. All the positives.  On to the reason for the 2 star rating. First and foremost the shitty service. Not only was our waiter unattentive and slow. He was careless. He didn't once offer to refill our empty glasses we had to ask. He didn't notice nor care that 1 of the 4 of us barley touched her food due to it being undercooked. (seriously meatloaf pink??) We also noted that our order was put in around 7:30, and we were patiently awaiting our check at 9:20.  Between us we had ribs that had jalapeno in the title, yet tasted sweet. 2 orders of undercooked meatloaf. And a steak.  The side items were decent, but even the taters that came with the meatloaf lacked consistency.  My boyfriend insisted we get dessert since all 4 of us were still hungry and there are not many places in town you can get freshly made monkey bread. Again a dissapointment. Small, and it took more like 20 minutes versus the 10 they claimed it to take.  Overall the bad food may have been a fluke. I could tell there was a potential for yummy-ness had they cooked the meatloaf another hour, added spice to the ribs, and a little love in their kitchen. On this trip they really lived up the the \"culinary dropout\" name and left a lot to be desired.",

    "text": "Culinary Dropout is real cool.  I was in vegas for a bachelor party and had to head up 19 dudes and was looking for a chill place to dine and all I did was pull up opentable with the parameters of dinner at 8 pm for a party of 20. Culinary dropout fit the bill with nice open seating, patio area to lounge and even live music. I chose the perfect spot. Kudos to me and yelp of course.  We all arrived on time and were seated immediately. As I said there was live music being performed which was on point. Just as a word of warning I was slightly inebriated for most of the night, but not enough to lose my memory and make an accurate account for this review.  Folks in my party were ordering beers on tap and other alky drinks. They came promptly and the drinkfest continued. Upon reading the reviews of this place beforehand the pretzels with fondue cheese were spoken highly of so the whole table got orders of that and it was bomb. I asked the waiter what he recommended on the menu and he pointed out that the most bang for buck dish was the fried chicken and that sold me. It was good but not mind blowing. There were three pieces; leg, thigh, and breast with a honey glazed biscuit, mashed potatoes and cole slaw. A massive dish indeed. Alky and greasy food go hand in hand.  The service was fantastic and the vibe and ambiance is well suited for big parties.",

We walked past several restaurants before the smell of juicy burgers drew us to this one. The sign outside mentioned specials on drafts and we could see that they had an outdoor patio so we decided to try it out.  The patio was absolutely the best feature of this place! Big wing back chairs, fire pits, couch seating, white lighting, etc. Beautiful and so inviting! They had a live musician up on stange playing guitar and singing, he was really talented and was taking requests, it was a nice addition to the atmosphere.  We weren't hungry enough to order a whole meal because we'd eaten at a buffet earlier in the day so we ordered draft beers ($3.50 special) and their specialty - the soft pretzels with provolone fondue ($12). TO DIE FOR!  The service was good - our waiter was patient and attentive. We can't wait to return.",

They also have these really big comfy chairs that would be fun to sit back in while watching a game and enjoying a beer. I've read some bad reviews about their staff but our waitress was really friendly so that was a plus too.  The food is where everything went downhill. We ordered pretzels with fondue cheese...which to me, was microwaved pretzel bites not cooked fully and some packaged cheese dip thrown over a candle. My wife had fried chicken which somehow got cooked in less than 5 minutes and was terrible, she barely even touched the food. The skin was soggy and gross, the meat was dry and had no flavor...worst of all it cost $22! I had a shaved prime rib dip that had a ton of fat with no flavor. I'm not sure how they justify $18 for this sandwich or the crazy prizes for anything else on their menu.   Culinary Dropout has pretty much everything going for it besides just one thing...good food. If it weren't for our waitress, I probably would have given this place 1 star. There was just nothing good about it. We wanted to try the monkey bread so bad but I really didn't feel like throwing away another $10 here!",

It was nice because it was just off the strip, so not very crowded, but we were very early (5pm) because of a show.  There was a nice outdoor patio, too.  The roasted beets were amazing!!",

Green beans, needed a minute more in the saute pan.. Fried chicken was good, the dark meat was moist, crisp skin, but the white meat was dry. Homemade potato chips was overly salted. Deviled prosciutto eggs, needed more than just prosciutto. No hostess to greet you. You have to find them. My Singapore sling was well made. My server was good, but I knew she was swamped. I guess a culinary dropout makes meatloaf, a graduate makes a terrine... Maybe it was a terrine, that's why it was cold....",

ANYWAY, food was great, fun, just the right mix of fancy and casual, great flavors, and not heavy.  Fun sitting outside and watching people at the pool- comfortable atmosphere, we'll be back!",

    "text": "This new place opened up recently with some good hype attached.  My friends and I decided to check this place out before the Prince concert at the Joint.  I'm certainly glad I did!  When you check into the hostess stand, you think this place is pretty small.  Don't be fooled by that.  It's HUGE inside.  A lot of seating inside and outside as well.  Huge bar area extending outside as well.  The outside area has a bunch of lounge tables.  Our table was half chairs and half booth.  Accommodated all people of my party.  Our server was nice, seemed a bit flustered as we did have a lot of questions and most of our drink requests were \"out of stock\" which didn't make too much sense.    Their menu is not too pricey.  Things go for $15-$30 depending on what you want.  On top of that, they have an AWESOME secret menu given out on concert days.  Since the Prince concert was there, they offered it to us!  Super fast and easy, it's only $25 dollars and comes with 3 main components:  starter salad OR soft pretzel, meatloaf OR fried chicken and a bag beer.  GREAT DEAL, by the way.  I chose the salad which was light a refreshing.  Spring mix with balsamic vinaigrette.  For the main course I got the fried chicken.  You get various dark and white meat pieces.  They gave a ton of that!  It was accompanied with mashed potatoes and gravy, sauteed green beans and a biscuit.  The chicken was super juicy and crispy on the outside!  The gravy really made the mashed potatoes, which were also very creamy.  The beans were sauteed with bacon and had a nice, light salty taste.  The biscuit also was dense and flaky with creamy butter.  SOOOOO GOOD!!  The beer was a low end beer, always different.  I got the Milwaukee's best.  The thing that enhances the experience is the paper bag it comes in.  Super creative for higher end restaurant.  Shows the lighter side of \"Las Vegas strip\" type restaurant.  I REALLY liked that :)  Definitely will be back for another try.  I would like to try their fish and chips, Korean style ribeye cap and salmon.  So many yummy toppings!  If you're in the Hard Rock hotel, I highly recommend this place before a concert, show, or date night!",

Unfortunately we were still full from lunch, so we didn't get to eat as much as we would have liked, so I'll review based on what we did have... Our server was great. She was super helpful, and helped us decide on cocktails, which were awesome. My husband had the Bells n Whistles, a spicy whiskey cocktail (don't order if you don't like spicy!) and I ordered a sparkling strawberry gin martini (can't remember the name but it was delicious!) We ordered the pretzel bites with fondue and the burrata (yeah, we like cheese, what about it?). The pretzel bites were...ok. A little less than warm for my liking. The cheese sauce (more sauce than fondue) was yummy. The burrata was OMG. I would definitely get it again. It was served with compressed pears, bacon syrup, walnuts, and greens, and the flavors and textures were all perfect together.  Like I said, by this point we were already full so we called it a night, but we definitely plan on coming back again and again until we have tried all the yummy things on the menu!",

From the simple like pretzel and cheese fondue to the more complex flank steak, the place succeeded in matters of taste and presentation.  The decor is impressive and fun.  The wait staff left a bit to be desired, but we were in a large group so it is understandable.  Lastly, the bar (while appearing to be a full bar) had a very limited selection in alcohols.  A really cool place though.",

There was some initial confusion because both our drink menu and our charcuterie options were outdated, but the server handled it well and I was happy with the tasty soppresseta and cheese.  I think it is a little much to charge for bread when I am paying for both meat and cheese separately, but with a few accompaniments, we could have easily made this our meal. I thought the fried chicken wasn't bad, but it wasn't great, either.  It came with a large biscuit, but no butter and the cole slaw was incredibly bland.  The drumstick and thigh were both juicy, but the breast was quite tough. We finished with the baked-to-order apple monkey bread, which was meh. All in all, this wouldn't be worth a trip to the Hard Rock, but if you were there already and hungry, you could find some decent food.",

We were not disappointed with the food.  For appetizers we had the pork rinds (delicious), the beets with goat cheese (awesome), and the prosciutto was excellent.  We had ordered the bread with that but there seemed to be some confusion as to whether or not we had so we did not get bread with that.  My sister had the fried chicken and she was very impressed as we all were because there was enough to share.  Her husband had the meat loaf and he cleaned his plate (and did not share).  I had the vegan curry with salmon and it was very flavorful.  For desert we had the trio, one for each of us as they only have 3 items on the desert menu.  The Banana cream pie was wonderful even though Paul was not willing to share too much.  The pull bread was sticky and sweet with a nice scoop of delicious vanilla ice cream and the smores was very rich with a thick layer of marshmallow on top.  There were a few things that could have been better but overall we had a great time.",

    "text": "Talk about joke. No wonder this place is called \"Culinary Dropout.\"  It was my girlfriend's birthday and her choice to eat here. I came a little later than 8:30pm on a Sunday; and it wasn't too busy to handle our 12 person party.   Already when I sat, I was greeted with my friends telling me not to order Hennessy and/or the oysters because \"they were out of it.\" Hmmm, ohhkaaay ---- I guess that ruled out those options.  I ordered a Moscow Mule and was saddened when it came in a regular glass cup. Sure, I would get a dollar off for bringing my own copper mug (as stated on their menu) but, who really carries around a copper mug. And if this place is gonna have 3+ assortments of \"mules\" then they need to have \"The Mug!\"  As we chit chatted, the waiter comes back to tell my roomie that the olives he ordered for his anti-pasti \"wasn't ready yet\" because \"it wasn't cured.\" --- what does that even mean --- My sassy 'tude was like, \"is it sick?\" My roomie said to just bring out the bread, sundried tomatoes, and balsamic. It was decent. Balsamic was sweeter than most I've had. In the end, it wasn't anything special.  My friend, who was sitting next to me, got the salmon entree. And lemme tell you that his first reaction to the dish was priceless; almost jaw dropping awe lol  His first words were: \"THIS was $25!\" (((Hence the picture/meme I have to go with this review))) The salmon was smaller than most salmon I've bought at the grocery store. It laid on less than handful of brown rice and veggies. My friend said: \"this would be the perfect dinner for someone on a diet -- too bad that aint me.\" Funny thing is this is what the waiter recommended as \"the best thing on the menu.\"  My friend had to share his girlfriend's burger and fries to get even some fulfillment. **SHRUGS**  I shared the jambalaya with my roomie and that was spicy enough to my liking and even though the chicken, shrimp, and sausage jambalaya was mixed in with rice; our Asian asses still ordered a side of rice with it. Other friends got the steak, meatloaf, curry, and prime rib dip sandwich. Everyone was pleased with their food but, in the end, it was nothing that stood out.  All the while we're eating, we were never filled with our water nor ordered more alcohol. It was just a less blah.   Even their monkey bread dessert, which we were told could serve 4 ppl, COULD NOT serve 4 ppl. It was like bite sized cinnabon donut holes if they had that.  Our waiter was funny tho and did the best he could with what he had, I'm sure.  Another thing I'm sure about is that I won't be back.",

The atmosphere is very casual so that could be why.   Food prices are more than fair, especially for Vegas. Bacon Bloody Mary was good but way too expensive for the size. ($13 for a glass half the size of a normal bloody mary).   As far as the food goes, it was good but everything had a twist of unusualness to it. The biscuits and gravy are not made the traditional way you'd expect. They were good but very different from any I've ever had. The Cap't Crunch French Toast & monkey bread were great!!

Captain crunch coating added a good texture, served with raspberries. Good item if you are ok with the sweetness.

There was so much food that this is where the review gets real..  we took some of everything home. The pastrami was just as good the next day, the grilled cheese was not soggy and was still crunchy the next day and the pretzel rolls tasted so good with the cup of cheese they packed Me to go.   We also tried the s'mores dessert and the monkey bread. They snuck apples into the dessert and I didn't even mind. The s'mores were great.   Of course there were drinks. Something with jalapeno which we drank quickly. The blueberry daiquiri and the dirty bird (the soiled dove).   Service was fast and very friendly. All employees seemed genuinely happy to work there and our waiter Johnny (Ric) was outstanding.   I recommend everyone go her to eat.",

Everything from the food to the environment to the service. Cool ambiance with adult giant games outside to play and lovely couches for seating outside. We ordered the avocado toast which was amazing, the salmon is a bit poached and not lox if you're expecting lox. Also ordered the breakfast sandwich which was made explicitly well and shared a captain crunch French toast that will blow your mind it's so delicious. We didn't have any cocktails but they looked amazing and people were finishing them fast which means they were delicious. Service was also great, food was made fast and our table was well waited on. The waitresses were well put together and didn't look like they were not happy to be there as they normally do. Menu is also well thought out it has little sayings for some items, for example, their \"Next Day Soup\" menu item says, \"soup always tastes better the next day\" etc. So impressed with this place that I told my bf we have to have breakfast here every time we are in Vegas!",

The wide open seating area has an open prepartion area at the front, tons of tables inside, a bar towards the patio and a large open patio next to one of the HR pools.  It is very airy and open.  We sat both on the patio and once just inside facing the pool, both was great.    We tried several dishes from the awesome pretzels and provolone fondue, to the prime rib sandwich to the black bottom pie.  It was all out of this world.    Service was attentive.  Atmosphere is laid back and the food is wonderful.  Definitely a  must if looking for a place to eat in the Hard Rock.",

Not only are the dishes delicious, but they also looks so sophisticated. It's a perfect place for the first date if you don't want to spend a fortune but still impress your date. The chef chose 3 different appetizers for us (cold cuts, cheeses, olives, asparagus nuts ecc), it was a good portion!!! We got also salmon crostini. Delicious. Our server was very fast and super friendly. The place has also a very affordable oyster bar. The only small complain I have is that they don't have wine for a happy hour. Everything else is perfect. Can't wait to come back.",

Only reason I say food is good and not great is that I got an antipasto, which isn't cooked, so I can't tell you too much.  What I can say, I ordered the antipasto, which comes with bread, and I asked if they could do it gluten free, as it was the main thing on happy hour that seemed gluten free, and they filled the plate up. Asparagus, meat, cheese, jam of some sort, and pickled mini peppers. Oh and almonds. I was impressed. I am new to this gluten free thing, so seeing that they added other things to take the place of the bread was pretty awesome to me.  Overall pretty great spot, good happy hour price an prices overall for Vegas hotel.",

For original menu offerings. For their great service. For their cool atmosphere (we ate outside).  We ate in the evening on a Thursday about 8 pm. Walked in with no reservation needed. Got seated outside. Was greeted right away by a friendly server. Ordered delicious and gourmet cocktails. The bartender even made up a special drink for me because what I wanted wasn't on the menu. It also had real black cherries and not just maraschino ones. (I am a cherry girl with my drinks and always ask for extra)  We tried the antipasti menu. (A new thing for us) we loved the pickled beets and the olives and the man  cheese. It was such a good way to start the meal.  We also ordered the sweet corn  ravioli.  We split the ravioli which had green beans and corn and cheese. It was creamy and delish.  We wanted dessert but were too full (I had 3 yummy cocktails).  We will definitely return and try other menu items.",

    "text": "The wife and I met one of her friends and her husband for dinner on Thursday night.  They brought their three daughters, all under the age of 10, who had varying levels of pickiness when it came to food.  It was the night of Game 5 of the Stanley Cup Finals so finding a place that could accommodate our party of seven during the game at a place that was easily accessible for someone driving to the restaurant, had plenty of free parking, while avoiding the Strip congestion, and had food options that would appeal to kids was a tall order.  Somewhat surprisingly, Culinary Dropout at the Hard Rock met all of the criteria.  Our party arrived shortly before our 7PM reservations.  We were seated outside on the patio at a large table.  It was a perfect night for dining al fresco, which also more peaceful since most of the people interested in the hockey game were inside.  I was in a beer mood.  Culinary Dropout had a relatively small list of beers, both on tap and in cans, but I liked that there were several local craft beers on it from which to choose.  I had the Joseph James Citra Rye pale ale ($7).  For our food, we shared and order of the Soft Pretzels & Provolone Fondue ($12).  Our order didn't come out with the other appetizers and we had to ask our server about it.  I don't know how many pretzels you're supposed to get or if they added some extra because of the delay but we received a basket stacked full of hot, airy pretzel rolls.  They were quite tasty, but it was definitely a lot of bread, even for our table!  For my main, I had the 36-hour Pork Ribs ($27), which were very flavorful and pull-off-the-bone tender.  While they certainly weren't the equal to a rack of pork ribs I've had at barbecue joints in KC or Memphis, I was very pleased with Culinary Dropout's offering.  It was quite satisfying.  To its credit, while not at all a place catering to kids, Culinary Dropout was surprisingly kid-friendly. Its food and non-alcoholic drinks like strawberry lemonade satisfied kids of all ages.  It also offered solid, attentive service.  Culinary Dropout proved to be an excellent choice for our party.",

But both mains I've tried, the Korean Ribeye cap and Meatloaf were terrible. No flavor. They do play some good music.  Had to eat here for a third time because we didn't have a choice. Had their wing. No flavor. Seriously, is this some sort of joke? How is a place where I've tried several things and most of them were tasteless get such a high amount of stars on Yelp. I feel tricked. I actually was looking forward to trying this place.  Update. I've actually tried almost all their dishes here. Because we're often forced to eat here. And the service and food are both pretty dismal. Some of the worst driest fried chicken you'll ever have.  I will say the server was very apologetic about the food. And comped a dish.",

Other than being seated next to a group of water drinking shop talkers, I got nothing though!  From the food, service and atmosphere, this place is absolutely spectacular on all fronts.   Let's talk about the scene - modern, fun and everything you could want in a hangout spot. A band playing awesome music (weekends at least); check!  An open indoor/ outdoor concept via a row of large roll up doors; perfect. A large patio that in addition to the dining tables, has some lounge seating and yard games such as corn hole, giant Jenga and most impressively, shuffle board; a great time is sure to be had.   Food - It'd be easy for a place like this to rely on their atmosphere while their food dwells in overpriced mediocrity. Not the case here as the food was absolutely delicious. I had the shaved prime rib sandwich and dare I say it was quite possibly the best one ever. The sandwich is served on a pillowy soft, in house baked, Focaccia roll that was the game maker. Normally I'd have my sandwich swimming in the Au Jus, but this thing was so good by itself that it was almost a disservice. I was like one small Au Jus dip for every third bite taken. I love the fact that the side can be substituted for house chips with French Onion dip. Once again, another delicious choice. I also partook in the trendy and highly publicized pretzel bites and Provolone fondue offering (I think I just posted the 538th pretzel picture). The pretzels were...pretzels, but the cheese was easily worthy of an oh my God or two. The Brussel spouts were another can't miss option. These aren't the ones you had down the street. The Korean style flavorings and noticeable spice is something special. The wide array of menu options is very impressive as well.   Service - I had quite possibly the best waiter I've experienced in my 30 some odd years of dining. Our waiter had the most remarkable people skills and did a fantastic job of explaining the menu, offering suggestions and overall just making our experience fun and memorable. I know that's a bold statement, but it's one I will stand behind.   There are so many wonderful dining options in Vegas that it can be hard to decide, but Culinary Dropout is a no brainer. I can say without hesitation that I'll be back here on my next Vegas trip. Seriously, awesome on all levels.   Pro tip: As of October 2018, you can signup for \"eBites\" on Culinary Dropout's website and receive an offer for $10 off when you spend at least $20.",

We started off with (we wanted everything btw) crusty bread with olive and balsamic. To die for. We had dolce Gorgonzola.  At first I was like $6.00 for two small square slices?  It was worth it. I'd pay $6.00 for one. We decided to also split pierogis with crispy Brussels sprouts. Melted in your mouth.  We wanted a bowl of the Brussels sprouts. Mustard creme friache that it came on was amazing.    I got the fish and chips.  Soooo good. It practically melted in your mouth as well. I was going to get the grilled cheese sliders but it looks like those no longer exist.  I also wanted the strawberry Brie and pistachio which shows online on the menu but also no longer exists.  My companion got a sandwich.  I hardly ever eat all the fries on a plate but they were super tasty! I am glad I got the fish.  Anyway we're definitely going back!",

    "text": "I bookmarked this restaurant before our trip to Vegas because the name sounded catchy. It's inside the Hard Rock Casino by the pool and thankfully, they were open for brunch cause we were out all night :)  First, we asked our friendly server what was the best hangover cure drink. She recommended Prairie Oyster shot made with raw egg, worcestershire, tabasco, salt and pepper. It did not sound or look appetizing but we were brave enough to try and it was actually not bad. Then I ordered the Capital Green made with white tequila, cilantro, mint verdita, pineapple and sparkling wine. It was a bit heavy and strong but I'm not complaining here. It was just what I needed after the shots...lol  Next, we ordered the Pork Belly Nachos to share. The nachos were made fresh in-house piled with flavorful pork, cheese, guac, sour cream, and beans. For the main course, I got myself the Honey Drizzled Fried Chicken with homemade buttermilk biscuit, coleslaw, and mash. Simply mouthwatering! The chicken was perfectly crisp, tasty and juicy. It's been a while since I had fried chicken this good. My buddies got the Grilled Cheese Sliders and Shave Prime Rib Dip. Both looked awesome as well and by the look on their faces, they enjoyed them. Breakfast items start at $8 to $14, sandwiches from $12 to $18 and entrees go for $18 to $27. Cocktails are about $12 average. My Fried Chicken was $22. Pricey but it was worth every penny.  We really had a pleasant experience at this restaurant. Good quality, big portions, delicious cocktails and super friendly staff. Plus it was not crazy busy so we got seated right away at a table with a nice view of the pool. Worth checking out if you're staying at the Hard Rock.",

From the hostess to the janitor, everyone in this joint was freaking beautiful. What does this have to do with quality food or service? NOTHING. But its just a fact everyone should know. Boom!  I actually ordered a couple things: Fish N Chips, Grilled Cheese, and The Turkey Pastrami. Without going into details, the Fish N Chips were ridiculously small and the Grilled Cheese was elementary. However, the Turkey Pastrami was incredible. It wasn't as greasy as the usual pastrami and tasty as hell!   Did I mention the employees? No, besides the fact that they were goddesses, the service was fantastic. I like to ask a waitress how something [that sounds gross] tastes. I wanna test their integrity. I love it when they say, \"Don't order that.\" And that they did! I like honesty. Makes me feel warm and fuzzy inside.   I'd go back. Obviously.",

So sad, the first time we went we raved about how good it was, in just a year it's plummeted.  The atmosphere is great, they have a nice outdoor space and bar.  They need to get it together, I had the grilled cheese and didn't wanna eat it, and that's rare!  How can u mess up grilled cheese? We also ordered the Italian grinder,  just a bunch of deli meat thrown on bread. I coulda made that at home.  So sad, this place a awesome, now it less than mediocre. I wonder what happened.",

The best part about the restraunt other then the ombiance and and wildly delicious food was the location. It wasnt difficult to get to and pretty easy to find.",

    "text": "I wish I didn't hate the Hard Rock so much because I love Culinary Dropout.  LOVE IT.  They have a TURKEY PASTRAMI SANDWICH.  Yes folks, you read that right - a turkey pastrami sandwich and it's to die for.  You know how all the buzz in the sandwich world right now is the pretzel bun?  And it seems like an awesome concept until you find yourself gnawing on a dry, dense piece of dull bread with a shiny pretzel finish?  Well, Culinary Dropout actually succeeds with the pretzel bun.  I love that bun so much I just might marry it.  I'm sick of being single anyway.    There's also a lovely slaw that drips from the sandwich that I found so tasty, I began scooping up the drippings with my fries.    I also tried their roasted beets (SO GOOD) and their deviled eggs.  Culinary Dropout has managed the impossible - they've made deviled eggs sexy.    Their only downfall is their location - ugh, the Hard Rock.  So many drunk twentysomethings in bedazzled t-shirts!  I will look past them though, for another chance to eat that sandwich though.  Those are powerful words, my friends.  Powerful words indeed.  Almost as powerful as \"pretzel bun\" ammIright?",

His name was Matt, he dressed very sharp, provided quick service and was laughing and engaging with all who were seated at the bar which leads to the atmosphere: it's fun! Hipster style, very open and airy, (entire wall facing pool area is wide open) and trendy. Definitely make this place a stop for some good food and drinks with a high energy atmosphere.",

A group of about 15 of us came here for a business lunch, which brings up an important point here: This is not a business appropriate place.  Extremely loud music, and a meal takes about two (2) hours to complete.  Three of us left without ever receiving our meals.  Or an explanation.  There was no manager on duty, and just a couple potentially intoxicated servers and busboys left to look dumbfounded as we asked for water.  The whole experience was like an episode of Jerry Springer unfolding before my eyes, but with inedible cheese fondue and spoiled artichokes.    Make no mistake, this is overpriced pool food, except it's wretched.  It just reeks of desperation.  There's not much left to say.",

Since we were a party of four, we got to have a few different things around the table starting with the pretzel bites which was more than plenty to share around the table.  I am on a salad kick and therefore ordered the kale and sweet potato salad with the salmon on top, and since I was hungry, yesterday's soup (chicken tortilla that day); the crunchy bits in the salad are pomegranate and overall it was a tasty and filling salad and salmon had a nice, flaky, crusty, finish that seems like the result of sweet glaze that I would love to replicate. My guy got the fried chicken and left nothing but bones on his plate.  I don't recall what the other guy at my table ordered other than his drink which was the \"double blind\" which turned out to be a 12oz can of Schafer Light and 1oz bottle of Smirnoff vodka; we had a great time laughing about it and then he ordered a Corona. The other gal at the table ordered the turkey pastrami, it was huge and she took half of it to go at the end of the meal.  As important as the food - the service.  I cannot recall the server's name, but he was attentive without being annoying and patient while we waffled over what to order initially.  Drinks were refilled in a timely manner without demand during the meal itself and since it was early and not crowded yet, he was patient without intrusion while we all chatted after the meal.    Quite possibly my favorite of the dinner venues we visited during the trip.",

At least when I go to a concert I know what I'm getting into and I bring earplugs in case it's too loud.    I shouldn't have to bring earplugs to dinner.

The bread it came with was super hard and I wasn't crazy about the salmon served with it, so I probably wouldn't order it again.  Finally, we shared the Meatloaf Sandwich, which was amazing, flavorful, and perfect for splitting.  Our waiter was extremely congenial and friendly, and even brought out a complimentary dessert, the Bourbon Black Bottom Pie.  That and the Meatloaf Sandwich are worth coming back for!",

    "text": "First off- the food was very good. I had the buratta appetizer which was great and a chicken club sandwich that was good. The bad was the rushed service. We were just seated and the waitress came by for drinks order,  We stated we had not had a chance to look at the specialty cocktail list as yet. Came back in 5 minutes and asked again, we still were undecided and she proceeded to tell us what was good- fine, we ordered and said we were looking still for food items- she then gave run down on food items and instead of allowing us time to look and decide asked again for our order. Okay we ordered. Half way through eating she comes back to ask about our dessert order. Uh, yeah we are still working on our dinner- we state we have not looked yet. The restaurant was not full and they were not busy. Comes back again while we are still eating to ask again about dessert, we say no thanks. She the brings the check while we are still eating dinner. WTF. I ask for more water and she asks \"Sure, do you want it in a to go cup?\" Are you kidding me. I can almost understand if they were packed and people were waiting to get in. Still rude, but this was ridiculous. We would have stayed and had more drinks if the service was good, but and that point we left ASAP.",

Funniest item was a honey almond micro brew from WI which came in a can so large that it was impossible to finish-good thing for beer I guess! Prices were firm for the portion sizes which were not generous-and the Seared Tuna Salad which I ordered was reasonably tasty-but the presentation was lackluster at best=looking like a bowl of lettuce with a few shreds of this or that thrown in and a few chopped up pieces of grey looking tuna which were certainly hard to distinguish from a lettuce leaf-hardly the normal presentation of fresh slices of seared rare tuna one would expect as the featured item in your bowl. Service was mediocre=no refills on ice tea and long lapses with barely a suggestion of dessert on a not full Monday night. Seems like an adequate option if you want drinks and bar food in an interesting vibe-but don't come hungry and expect to fill up unless you order plenty and if eating healthy is the idea-would pass also. Most of the rave food options are fried and heavy on fat loaded dips-maybe the right idea to ward off a hang over..",

    "text": "My husband and I made reservations for C.D. a couple days before we were going to go because Hard Rock was having a concert we were attending and we wanted to make sure we got a table. When we arrived at 5pm, the place was mostly empty, which was fine. The hostess was Very Friendly and Talkitive. The inside was nice, a little funky and casual. Our waiter arrived shortly after and took drink orders. I was a bit suprised at how laid back he was, i knew from reading reviews that staff wore street clothes, however it took me byu suprise when out waiter pulled up a chat to take take our order. He was friendly and asnwered the million questions i had. We had crusty bread for an app., it was great (i love bread) The drinks we ordered were AMAZING, The service was quick and our food arrived hot. I got the pub burger, which was one of the best burgers I have ever had. My husband got the meatloaf, which was pink on the inside, really pink. He ended up sending it back, the manager came over to our table and explained it was cooked, it looked pink because of the way it was cooked but they were making a new meat loaf for my husband, He was very friendly and professional. Once the meat loaf came out it was done perfect. We decided that we were going to have dessert and otdered the monkey bread, our waiter let us know its made fresh so it will 8-10 mins. Between the time we waited for the meatloaf and when we ordered dessert, they got busy, which put them a bit behind. So after 15 mins of waiting for our dessert (whioch it didnt seems that long, we were having a nice time talking and having a drink) the manager comes over to the table, and lets us know he has good news and bad news, the bad news is our monkeybread is going to take another 8 mins but in the mean time they are going to comp us andother dessert for free and sets down the salted carmel pudding with house made carmel corn. It was wonderful, the best pudding i have ever had. Once out monkey bread arrives our waiter lets us know that is on the house as well, i treid telling it was fine we were more than happy to pay for it but he wouldnt add it to the bill. My husband loved the monkey bread. i did not have any becuase i was beyond full. We had a wonderful experince, the staff and manager were all great. I can not wait to go back!",

It was something cheap, which made him laugh. He's no snob so he still drank it. I had their Riesling and my partner had the moscato, both were good. Did the pretzel bites with fondue and home made chips with french onion dip. Chips and dip were good, pretzels and fondue were amazing. I was surprised that they did provolone but it was excellent. Saw mussels, fried chicken and a few other things go out. All looked good. Ambiance is cool. Love Hard Rock, like this place too.",

    "text": "How could I forget to Yelp the Culinary Dropout? I was staying at the HRH with my brother Tom this past December, and we dined @ the CD twice. The first night (a Monday I believe), we were one of two tables eating dinner at around 6:00 p.m. The servers here wear \"regular/hipster\" clothes, and are very helpful with the menu. The very pretty blond server, complete with cutoff shorts, recommended the pretzel and cheese appetizer and fried chicken. Both being Foodies, we inhaled the appetizer. This is their signature dish and it doesn't disappoint. Tom got the fried chicken and I the Italian sandwich. Both were tasty and well prepared. I have the feeling from other Yelpers, that the menu is a can't miss on all dishes.        The interior of the DC is modern. They have a square bar, a stage for bands, and an outdoor area with heat lamps. I recommend the bar if you are getting just an app and drinks. On our second visit, we got the pretzel app again an a few beers. They have a great beer selection on tap. We also sampled some Absinthe......wow. So, if near the HRH and hungry, take a chance on the Culinary Dropout. You will be happy you did.",

SWe go the chacutuerie plate, I liked the roasted tomates that we ordered but none of the meat or cheese stood out to me. Also shared the fried chicken which had a sweet sauce on it, not a fan of that. The mashed potatoes were good though. Jambalyaya was OK, tasted more like cajun flavored fried rice because the texture of the rice wasn't as sticky as I imagined Jambalaya to be.

I don't think they have a restaurant that I haven't loved, and Culinary Dropout was no exception. Our server, Elliot was very attentive and it almost seemed like whenever I wanted something he was right there. The atmosphere was very cool. We sat on the patio outside and, despite being surrounded by a huge hotel, the lights and decorations created an intimate atmosphere.   Since this was our first time at the restaurant, we asked Elliot to select some of his favorite items on the menu for us to share. He brought over mini grilled cheese sandwiches, roasted artichokes, soft pretzels with cheese dipping sauce, crispy bread with burrata cheese, pork ribs, and an ahi tuna salad. Everything was fantastic. I had a great time there and will definitely return on my next Vegas visit.  As you can see by my rating, this is place you should check out.",

Don't get me wrong, 35 and Nobu are both amazing restaurants if you want to drop some coin, and Mr Luckys is great for simple diner fare, but there was nothing really in between. Now there is.  Dropout has a really innovative menu, with lots of delicious and creative choices and preparations. They opened about a month ago, and since I work conveniently nearby, we have eaten there at least half a dozen times so far.  Highlights include the raw bar, the antipasti menu, and the indoor/outdoor seating. Well done HRH. The only downsides so far has been the live acoustic music, which is hit or miss and always way too loud. (Hint: sit outside to avoid this) And 2 separate times I got shrimp (Huge shrimp, sold by the piece) and they were a bit pasty on the outside, as if they were starting to turn, but the staff was quick to replace them. So 1-star off for funky shrimp, but I do love this place.",

We got the pretzels with cheese dip and it was not my favorite, but I'm not a huge fan of pretzels and dip anyways.  Our server gave them to us for free because she forgot to put our order into the kitchen.  However, she couldn't have forgotten for more than 5 minutes; we had our food within 15 to 20 minutes.  It was really sweet of her to do!!!  My Husband got the Thai Chile Chicken Wings.  I loved them and he was not all that thrilled.  I just don't think he is used to Thai flavors.  I got the Sweet Corn Ravioli and my Husband and I both LOVED it!! I can't even describe how awesome and different it was!!!  I would defiantly go back!!!  However, I wish they had more menu options. I felt like nothing looked good to me, but when I actually tried it, it was awesome!!",

Located within the Hard Rock Cafe, which is not on the Las Vegas strip sits a trendy little eatery and bar dishing out some ice cold drinks,  snacks, burgers and delicious dishes.   What I loved here was the whole design of the resturant. The Ambience here is super cool. You have a variety of tables, chairs, couches to dine on, both inside and out. Outdoor seating gives you a clear pool side view. Service is right on track, with eye candy servers with pleasant personalities. Had a very resort like feel to it.  For starters we had the homemade chips and dip. They were fresh and yummy.  I was hoping to of found my 5 star burger here, but my burger did not deliver that 5 star satisfaction.  My hand made burger topped with Havani cheese and bacon on a toasted bun was on the dry side. It was complimented with a little side salad with basalmic vinegar dressing. My date had the fried chicken and mashed tatters which he thought was just okay.  Lunch for 2 was about $45.00  Service 4 Stars Location 4 Stars Food 3 Stars  Review #468",

This is a great place to come with a large group of friend and enjoy nice drinks. However, the food is not all there. I was very disappointed with the food options. I ordered their popular cheese and pretzels. The cheese was good, and for a large party it might be a good option. However, there is really nothing overly special about it.  I also had the tuna salad, well that was actually very good. But not everyone can eat the salad for a whole meal. I ordered the Meat Loft and it was just ok. I would not recommend it at all.  Truly, the restaurant is not terrible. However, this is Las Vegas, and there are so many more options out there that it's probably not worth coming back.",

Staff was all really helpful and it was nice to talk to people around my age. They're also all attractive and dressed cool since it's hard rock after all.  Got the signature old fashioned and while a little on the sweet side it was still really good!  Got the turkey ruben and holy hell it was so good and I dont even consider myself a ruben girl. That pretzel bun pushes it to the top! I also got the perogi and it was a really interesting take on traditional perogi. They were really great too!  Overall I'm sad I was too stuffed to try the monkey bread but I'll be back here for sure!! Maybe tomorrow :D",

We just happened to drop in to Culinary Dropout. They had plenty of space around 7pm on a Thursday, but as we were leaving a couple hours later, the bar and tables were all starting to get rowdy and full.  Our waitress was super friendly, sweet and impeccable with her timing. Which made for a smooth dining experience from start to finish.    Maybe I don't get out enough or maybe just maybe my food sensors have become much more easier to please. But I would vote this salmon the best I've had within the year!! The apples and Brussels Sprouts that complimented the filet made for an explosion of flavor in my mouth. Whew... :: eyes were definitely rolling to the back of my head.   I'm a huge fan, even if the guy was a dropout.   Enjoy!",

Service was on point with a super friendly waitress (can't member her name but she was Asian), and the food was really good.  The Good: We hit the Happy Hour pretty hard. Double Blinds, pretzel fondue, antipasto, red sangria (but not the white), chicken/shrimp, were all very good. Waitress was very attendant and she was great with our kiddos. Red liquorish Pinnacle Vodka may be my new favorite liquor store shooter.   The Bad: No band playing during the week, sweet happy hour + band woulda been epic.   The Ugly: We tried to sit outside in the Vegas heat at 5 PM (~98 degrees). Not a good idea. #schwettyballs  Overall we had a great time. I highly recommend their Happy Hour.",

When my wife asked him what frites was, he looked at her like your kidding - I told my wife that its a fancy way of stating  them as fancy fries - where he decided to correct me and state that  was not so.. That frites are an assortment of thinly sliced vegetable. Alrighty then.. onward.  We ordered: Prosciutto Deviled Eggs  - Great - But Eats - (Natalie Youngs place has the best!) Cheddar Pork Cracklings - Horrible - store bought stale with heavy dried cheese sprinkles  Cheap House Salad Shaved Prime Rib Dip - Quite good a few  Between You & Me  drinks - Yes  The attitude of the server didn't help but the flaws in the quality of some of the menu items will make this a non-repeat place its too bad cause the energy and decor rock!",

I ordered the House Salad to start off with, a Turkey Pistrami sandwich to assuage my appetite, and a Bourbon Black Bottom Pie as a closure to my meal.  First-Course - House Salad: Just like the name states, it's a house salad. Standard greens, nothing creative, this comes with buttermilk ranch. I was praying that this basic salad wasn't foreshadowing what was to come next.  Second-Course - Turkey Pistrami: This made up for the first-course. Served on a pretzel roll are slices of peppery turkey pistrami and lightly-dressed coleslaw, this sandwich is on the heavy side, but it's delish!   Third-Course - Bourbon Black Bottom Pie: I love this. I can eat this all day long until I barf. This is a rich and chocolaty ganache with salted, crumbled graham crackers that form the bottom of the pie. The light sweetness of the chocolate and the salty crackers pair together perfectly.  Service: Good.  Overall: I'm giving Culinary Drop Out an \"A.\" The salad may have been \"blah,\" but everything else was terrific,",

My wife and I are vegan and the menu was a little confusing. They explained it to us and we just said what ever the chef wants to make us.   By far the food we got from chef Helena was the best we have had in this town.  We then learned that she is also a vegan.

The gravy was on point and balanced well with the crisp chicken and buttery biscuit. Really savory and yummy.  Next I tried the fish and chips. I know wierd getting this for a late brunch but the fries looked and tasted like they were peeled and sliced in house. They had the same texture as what my grandma would make from scratch. Not the frozen out of the bag variety. The fish was flaky and had a nice thick, crunchy, batter.  Gotta check this place out if your hungry and in the hard rock hotel!",

I planned a surprise dinner for my boyfriend's birthday and they were so helpful with everything along the process! I spoke to Wendy about the dinner and she helped me plan everything, and accommodated all of us, despite the changes. When we got there, the staff, especially the manager, were more than very helpful towards us. We were a very large party, but the servers were quick and attentive.   Since we were a large party, we had to pick a select menu. The picture was of my food, which was the butternut squash ravioli. It was delicious, but it was quite small and I got hungry after an hour. However, I did love the pretzel bread and the cheese fondue. I could eat that over and over again!   I loved how they have live music, but it was a bit too loud. Other than that though, I thoroughly enjoyed everything, and my boyfriend definitely had a great time.",

I have had it stashed away in my bookmarks for a couple of years now and finally had the nerve to head down and try it as a birthday treat for myself. I was not disappointed.  With the help of other Yelpers reviews, I decided on the fried chicken entree. I was taken aback a little by the price, but thought why not? The chicken was very tender and the skin was crispy and the honey gave it a slightly sweet note. I'm a sucker for sweet and salty combinations and this chicken hit it out of the park for me. Mashed potatoes and a biscuit accompany the chicken in this dish, which were also great. Hubby opted for the pastrami, which he enjoyed.  The service was also great. Our hostess was quick with checking on us and she did an excellent job helping us navigate the menu as it was our first visit.  The restaurant itself is so cute too! There's no dress code, so it's perfect for a casual get together, but their outdoor area is stunning and would make it suitable for a date.  I had a great time and I found myself interested in multiple menu items, so that will likely prompt me to visit again. No regrets!",

My wife and I shared a Kale Salad to start. The kitchen split it for us at no extra charge. Nice touch. The salad was great. They either order premium processed kale or do an amazing job in prep. There were no woody stems and the kale was chopped pretty finely. Great work.   Based on recommendation of the host and our server, we opted for the Fried Chicken dinner. It was a share and once again, the kitchen split it at no charge. Very nice. We opted to get 2 breasts instead of 1 plus a leg and thigh (+$4). The meal was excellent except for one thing. The mashed potatoes and gravy were not hot. Not really even warm. Our server promptly brought out a replacement and it was the same. Oops. We told her not to bother with a 3rd. We ate it at room temp.   So for our first experience here, I'd say pretty good. Withheld 1 star due to the kitchen snafu on the taters. Sorry.",

It was pretty empty every time we stopped by (like 6 times during our stay) and we were able to take over the patio area.  The have bean bags and some other outdoor games to play with while surrounded by the tropical pool setting.  The staff here was super friendly and accommodating.  The one waitress with the nose ring was awesome and took good care of our group every night.  They do a good job for large group dinners and set up an awesome buffet.  I am sure prices are pretty high, but it is Vegas and this does provide a solid experience.  Food here was pretty good both on the menu and catered.  The standout was the charcuterie platters. We had several different excellent meats and cheeses.  Food on our dinner buffet was pretty good but didn't really go together.  It was a bunch of really good items that were hot and full the entire time our party was there.  Check this place out if you are at the Hard Rock and looking for a great place to relax and enjoy the scenery.",

Their menu has a good range of options from burgers and hummus to healthy salads so it's a good place for groups with differing tastes.   Came back here again and the tried the nachos. They are amazing!!! Super loaded with toppings! The Moscow Mule is really good too - I think they have a home made ginger beer brew. The Korean Brussels Sprouts are also delicious and super flavorful. My fav place to eat at the hard rock.",

After a long day at Rehab I spotted Culinary Dropout across the promenade, I'd been wanting to come here for a while now but being located inside the Hard Rock made it a hassle (I know, I'm super lazy!)  So we put on some clothes (barely any, shorts and bikini top for me), and cozied up to the bar for some much needed water and food to counteract all the booze and sun. We started w the Pretzel Fondue which was served w a sterno to keep the cheese perfectly warm for prolonged dipping - A+  I got the Sweet Corn Ravioli which was so awesome! OMG it was the perfect lunch for a day at the pool - beautifully served and with perfectly paired flavors!  My mate got the Crispy Shrimp Caesar Salad which he really enjoyed (I can't eat shrimp so I can't vouch), he said it \"exceeded expectations\" (he's not very good at this Lol).  The best part is, after having an extremely enjoyable lunch in every way possible, we got the $30 bill ?!? Cheaper than 1 drink at Rehab!  Excellent way to end our already awesome day.",

Several drink specials seemed relatively reasonable for Vegas, but I just stick to the draft beers, but I found a few good ones! Pork belly nachos was first on our list. Great crunch to the chips and flavorful toppings, but the cheese sauce left us wanting more flavor. That was to the establishments detriment because we ordered the pretzel bites were served with what we assumed was the same lackluster sauce. Additionally the pretzels lacked the chewyness my teeth demands of a pretzel...it was more like a pretzel bun than good chewy pretzely form goodness(and our first go st it came out cheese and pretzels cold). The star of the show was the hand cut fries...great flavor and perfectly salted...Potato perfection!!!  Ambiance is industrial open air, prices were within reason, and service was good.  With so many joints to try in this desert oasis and the lackluster first bite I can't say we will be back for another go. This joint does not make the list...",

The bread was drenched with balsamic vinegar which overpowered any flavor you tried to pair it with. The only good food item was the Brussel sprouts. Service wasn't bad, not great either.

    "text": "So it was Restaurant Week out in Vegas and what better way to celebrate Restaurant Week than a visit to a restaurant during the week! Do I sound redundant?  There was a special meal deal HolyField offer that was going on at the Culinary Dropout inside the Hard Rock Hotel/Casino where you'd get a three course meal for the low low price of $30. We'd be crazy to turn that down!  My girl and I went around lunch time and were promptly seated. The overall layout is very bar/restaurant-esque. The pool is right outside and the bar had a number of televisions set up. We were seated in a booth. Overall ambiance was mellow and good.  We ordered the Pork Belly Nachos off the Happy Hour Menu and one of the Restaurant Week's Recommended Fried Chicken Dinner which had Course (1) Pretzel Bread and Fondue, Course (2) Fried Chicken Dinner with mash potatoes & gravy, biscuit, and coleslaw, Course (3) Slice of banana cream pie.  The Pork Belly Nachos were yuge!! Bigly! Overall super delicious and generous in portion sizes. They piled on the toppings. We were pretty full before the rest of the food even came out.  Course 1: The pretzel bread fondue was tasty but a little too salty. The melted cheese just added to the sodium count, but you know what? When you're out in Vegas you need some salt to keep you hydrated like electrolytes do. \"ELECTROLYTES! IT'S WHAT PLANTS CRAVE!\". Overall the bread was crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside.  Course 2: The waitress knew we were sharing everything so she went ahead and split up the half chicken, mash potatoes, gave use each our own biscuits, and each a strong heaping of coleslaw. It's crazy to imagine that all that food was meant as a dinner course for one person. The nachos themselves were ginormous! The chicken was crunchy and great. Wasn't too oily that caused your hands to get super greasy. Greasy fingers annoy the hell outta me especially when you let your friend play a round of Counterstrike on your PC and they get your mouse all oily. (MAN I HATE THAT! WASH YOUR FREAKING HANDS JAY BEFORE YOU USE MY MOUSE!)  Anyways.... the mash potatoes and gravy were also good, but standard issue. Not really outstanding, but good nonetheless. Same opinion of the coleslaw. The biscuits were top-notch though since they were drizzled with some honey which took them up to Super Saiyan level 2.  Course 3: The banana cream pie was A-Ok. Both of us weren't really fans of it, but it also wasn't terrible. It was just down the middle.  Culinary Dropout is definitely worth another visit or a first time visit if you're looking to shovel copious amounts of food down your pie hole for a reasonable price.  The main takeaway though is to wash your hands after eating greasy food before using your friend's mouse.",

When I came back sober, it was more like 3.5 stars lol. SO, we're at an average of 3 point something, rounding up to 4.   Ambiance, I'll give them a 5/5. They had a live duet and they were playing covers.   The nachos and soft pretzel/cheese was excellent. They had a wide selection of things for charcuterie board. Nothing really stood out to me.",

Food was great and the Bacon Bloody Mary's were a fantastic choice.  They have live music weekend evenings and the musician was amazing and we had the option of dining inside with the crowd or chilling on the patio (pool area closed for the season).

We were seated at the indoor/outdoor section,  great view of the pool area and quiet enough still to enjoy my amazing company.  Started out with the bacon vodka bloody mary! Omg, mouth watering to say the least. It wasnt strong and it didnt inhabit that overly strong vodka taste. It was just right! 5 stars!!  I then had the lobster benedict. Large peices of lobster, served over a poached egg and sauce to top off its amazingness!!    Definitely recommend this super trendy spot for a brunch day with the ladies or a day date!!",

Plenty of seats open so we were seated pretty quick. I really enjoyed the set up of the restaurant. The wallpaper had some notable singers (MJ, Amy Winehouse, Elvis, etc.) and their chairs and booths were really nice and comfortable.   The staff here was really easy to get along with. They were really nice and friendly and easy to talk to. We felt very welcome which made us very happy to be there.   I'd say the food here is pretty good. Tbh when I found this place on Yelp, I was debating if I really wanted to come here or not because half of me thought it looked really good, while the other half of me thought it looked super boring. Let me tell you now, this place isn't boring at all and it is worth every penny.   This was not the best place I've been to, but it was definitely really good. Probably not a place I'd go out of my way to come to, but I would come back if I was in the area. I would definitely recommend it to my friends and what not.",

Three out of four of us ordered the fried chicken because it was highly recommended. My buddies got theirs and they bring me the wrong order. They quickly brought me a new plate with my order. My entire plate was cold. Biscuit was inedible. Mashed potatoes could have been instant from a box. The coleslaw was 50% mayonnaise. The chicken skin was nicely spiced and very crispy. The chicken inside was dry. Everyone ordered a different cocktail. All of them were blah. No one finished theirs.   I am giving this place 2 stars because my friends order of ribs was quite tasty and the love music was great! I woulda stayed for them.",

Frankly it tasted like soft pretzel bites dipped in milky nacho cheese more than a fondue.   I usually go with the yelp highlights, but in this case it was the fried chicken and it sounded a bit heavy at the time. I decided to go with the chicken sandwich (I believe it was on a focaccia roll). It was relatively good, but not particularly memorable.   All in all, the meal and the service were ok, but nothing stood out.  Given the massive amount of dining options in Vegas, I'm unlikely to come back under my own volition, but I wouldn't be opposed if a friend was set on going.",

They're these middling restaurants that cost $50-$75 or $100 for two and they think they're all rad and ... they're not.  I just said to my girlfriend that I would almost drive the 3 hours to Vegas to have the turkey pastrami sandwich they have.  It's fantastic.  We started with pretzels and provolone cheese sauce.  Again, fantastic!    The charcuterie was both generous and the selections were very well-curated.    I should also mention the service.  In Los Angeles we have actor-waiters.  They suck.  Perhaps not all of them suck but at least 90% of them suck.  We both always tell people to get real service -- and sometimes \"real food\" -- one has to go to Vegas.  This restaurant didn't disappoint.  Anne Marie was amazing.  She knew the menu well and made recommendations that we all enjoyed a lot.    Oh, yeah, the Manhattan cocktail they have is terrific!  When we go back to as a couple and not when I'm there for meetings we are DEFINITELY going back here for at least one meal!    Bravo, guys!  Now ... get off your asses and come to Los Angeles!!!!",

    "text": "Some places are all hype and Culinary Dropout is a perfect example.  Looking for overpriced, small portioned and low quality food? You got it at CD.  For $20 you can get a slide of meatloaf, instant mashed potatoes and green beans. $15 for grilled cheese and tomato soup the food here is just meh.  The restaurant itself is pretty nice and alot bigger than it looks. Its nice to have indoor and door seating and a place like this. The beers we ordered from the bar came wrapped in brown paper bags which is a cool touch. Service was pretty lacking during our experience. Having to wave down our careless waiter for refills got old real quick. The restaurant itself its pretty nice, good ambiance and decor but none of this makes up for the subpar food and service.",

Tasty craft cocktails, innovative and interesting menu and comfortable surroundings!  We can't wait to go back!  This place is similar to yardbird But Like five million times better. If you have a choice, make this your stop  Jambalaya rocks!  The trout was cooked perfectly and awesome!  All of the apps were tasty and the cheeses available were surprisingly good for a casual restaurant.  You have to order the Pretzel bites...HAVE TOO.  Only wish I had ordered the chicken, next time for sure!  We were so crazy on Apps and meals that we didn't have room for desert either.  Great job!",

It's a good thing that I didn't ask her what she thought about any specific wine because I doubt that she would have been able to answer my question but she was able to pour a Grey Goose & Red Bull so she gets a star for that extremely difficult drink(sarcasm groan inserted here).

    "text": "It started out good, but sadly the main course failed to deliver. We came to Culinary Dropout after a super long day driving to and from the Grand Canyon and we wanted food that was convenient. It's literally an elevator ride away from our room on the upper floor of the Hardrock Hotel.   Loved the super spacious layout of the interior. Great for groups and it opens out into a patio area near the pool. Great for the lovely summer weather. We came on a Thursdays night around 10pm (they close at 11pm) and the restaurant was fairly empty. Service was attentive and they happily made recommendations. We ordered:  *Pretzels and provolone fondue: Good! I was a little hesitant at first but the whole combination was delicious. Also, the pretzels weren't overly salted but buttery, which was great. Fondue was a great consistency too.  *Pork belly toast: Good but the open face baguette the pork belly was on was a little soggy. The flavors were fresh and reminded me of a Vietnamese banh mi sandwich. The pork belly was flavored so well, and was cooked so that it was crisp.  *27 hour pork ribs: Lackluster, except for the fries. The pork ribs were cooked decently, but the molasses sauce was a little too tangy. The coleslaw was really bad. It didn't taste like anything at all. I rather have a side salad raw. The cool thing was that they split it for us because they knew we were sharing.  *Bourbon black bottom pie: Great! Chocolate ganache and graham cracker crust. Soooo good. The bourbon flavor was actually pretty strong. We got it for free was a birthday treat. Yay!   SIDE NOTE: Culinary Dropout allows their servers to wear anything that they want, this include jewelry and facial piercings. While our server was talking to us, his lip ring fell onto the floor and we never found it. While it wasn't a big deal to us (although I found it hilarious), I'd imagine a worse situation in which it could have fell into a drink or food. Sooo...just keep this in mind. =P",

I liked that. They had sports on everywhere, friendly staff, and the patrons all seemed to be having a good time. I sat at the bar and looked through thier drink menu.. lots of impressive craft cocktails. I had the spicy tequila one (I forget the name) and it was the best drink I had in Vegas! The bartenders were so nice and super helpful. I had the buffalo chicken meatballs (they were sooo yummy) and the brussel sprout small plate- also yummy. This place is seriously a find!

We shared the fried chicken and the Beef Stroganoff.  The coleslaw on the chicken plate was surprisingly scrumptious.  We had a amazing peanut Butter & Chocolate bar with fresh cream Oh and their Coffee (passport organic we were told) was very yummy.  Cool vibe, great music, great decor, great staff and fun place.

    "text": "I really wanted to like this place. The reviews on Yelp got me a little amped up and was about to forget about the fact that I'm about to spend $22 for a fried chicken dish. Others raved it was amazing and worth it.   The hostess was great and seated us near the bar. We noticed it was incredibly hot in there and asked the staff if the air conditioning was on. Then I noticed the large sliding door behind the bar was open. Why would you have it open in June with it 95+ degrees outside. We were about to leave, but decided it would be worth it to stay.  Our server was the next bad part. He came right away with water but when we told him we were ready to order he told me he is only taking drink orders right now. We settled with just water. He came back 20 minutes later to finally take our food order. Again, we stayed because we knew it had to be worth it.  I ordered the fried chicken of course and my buddy ordered the stroganoff. Luckily it didn't take too long for the food to arrive though it wasn't fast either. I was starving by the time it arrived. I took a bite into the chicken and didn't really expect the honey glaze. It was alright, but just a little surprise. The chicken was cooked amazingly. The breast was very juicy and not dry at all. It did need some more seasoning though. It came with gravy so i guess you're supposed to dip it into it. The gravy was pretty bad. It tasted like it came in a paper pouch that you buy for $.50 at the grocery store.  The side dishes were not good. The cole slaw was soggy and lacked any flavor. Even with a ton of salt & pepper it didn't taste very good. The mashed potatoes tasted bland. What restaurant just serves mash potatoes with no seasonings or spices in it? Again, the gravy was bad. The biscuit though was really good. The honey crust on top was flavorful.  I wouldn't come back here. Everything on the menu was overly priced and sorry but the chicken was over hyped. Sure it was fried very nicely, but lacked spices.",

The fondue that comes with it is just the right amount of cheesy.  Flavorful but not so strong that it kills your taste buds.    I can't say enough about the Ramen.  It was very delicious.  The pork belly was not chewy and I was sad when I had no more left in the bowl.  It was seasoned well.  I just wanted more!    It was a great meal.

    "text": "So, I've been to a couple events where culinary had a booth and I really liked their pretzels and provolone fondue. So I bookmarked and made my way over. Me and some friend decided to go for dinner and grab some drinks and food. We of coursed started with the pretzels and fondue and some drinks. We each ordered our own drinks and passed around. We order the Moscato, Room Service, and After School Special to start. I was the lucky one to order the Room Service. It has gin, strawberry simple, lemon, and sparkling wine in it and I usually have other liquors, but it was served up and it was delicious. We then ordered our food. I ordered the fried chicken, which came with a biscuit, mashed potatoes, and slaw. It came with 3 pieces which was more than enough but it just wasn't very seasoned. It was just okay. Allyface ordered steak which I thought was a little cold and Niy Niy ordered the shrimp and pork belly ramen. I think his was the best bowl at the table. We also ordered another round of drinks. Next order was another after school special, between you and me, and pinot grigio. I wasn't too thrilled with the between you and me. The belvedere and grapefruit just didn't do it for me. As far as service they were great. We came in and were brought out water before we even started ordering. Our waiter was helpful with the selections as far as drinks and choosing between some menu items. I just wasn't impressed. I mean it was good but it wasn't worth the $150. I still want to go back and try the captain crunch french toast, that may win me over... we shall see.",

I really wanted to try the soft pretzels appetizer but my friend wasn't that hungry so I didn't. The table next to us ordered them though and they looked amazing! lol  I had the Warm Italian Grinder with fries. It was a sort of a grilled sandwich on pretty large bread. My friend ordered the fried chicken and it looked delicious!! I'm not that into fried chicken usually, but I will order it next time for sure!!! She said it was as delicious as it looked.  The atmosphere is laid back but very trendy decorations. Our table had a couch on one side of the table instead of chairs and big, comfy chairs on the other side. So overall a comfortable atmosphere! I noticed a nice patio outside but it was too chilly for us.",

I wish she had asked if we could sit on the patio area. But she didn't.  Anyway, I ordered the pretzel fondue and it was delicious. I then looked at the menu again and I noticed how overpriced everything was. So, I ordered some fries and the cheese fondue as a dip.  My friends ordered the club sandwich and a soup and salad. They were mediocre at best. (I tasted the food. Bah!) Everything in this place screams Hard Rock and the ambience is great. But the food is way overpriced and under made. Oh and the tapas are $8 an oz for cheeses and meats. Hamon de Seranno at market price was $18. That's more than an oz of silver. I would of given the place 1/5 stars initially.   The only reason why I gave this place 3/5 stars were the drinks. They're $12 for mixed drinks, but they don't skimp on the alcohol. And they're good too. That's it.",

    "text": "Thanks to a flurry of $30 food credits, we hit Culinary Dropout on an almost weekly basis for a couple of months.  First, let's start with the pretzels and fondue. No, really, you HAVE to start with the pretzels and fondue. If you set foot in here and you don't get the pretzels and fondue, you are messing up. The pretzels are literally the best I've ever eaten - soft, airy and pillow-light.  Another essential bar bite on the menu is the chips and French onion dip, freshly made and delicious.  As for the entrees, I've stuck to the sandwiches and burgers for the most part, and I've never been disappointed. The shaved French rib dip on a soft brioche roll is exceptional. The turkey pastrami is zesty, flavorful and balanced (although the pretzel roll, while delicious, may be redundant if you've had the pretzels as a starter.)  Besides the regular menu, Culinary Dropout occasionally features beer tasting dinners. We attended one that paired a five-course menu with beers from local brewer Joseph James, who had representatives dining with us and explaining the brewing process behind each of their varieties. Seeing what Culinary Dropout's chefs can do with a little creative freedom cemented this as one of our favorite restaurants in all of Vegas.  Patio seating, along the Hard Rock pool, is amazing if the weather permits and the pool isn't full of d-bags.",

We pretty much ordered everything on the antipasta menu, the only real standouts were the deviled eggs and the prosciutto, everything else you could get at the deli counter in your local supermarket.  For the entree I had the chicken club sandwich...  Now, time to stand on my soap box, if you are going to do basic food, but charge a non basic price, it better be good food, sadly, Jack in the Box makes a better chicken club, then they DON'T pile an ice cold bunch of ham on top of the piece of chicken, which in this case came from a small chicken, not good.  The sides, how can I put this, they were straight out of the US Foods/ Sysco catalog, open the tub, and serve, for a premium bar charging semi premium prices, the whole thing just stank of lazy cooking, take pre-prepared food, heat and serve.  The service was okay, friendly, not quick, but always a smile at least.",

    "text": "In recent years Las Vegas has seen various forms of 'Gastro-Pub' appear here and there around town. 'Herb's and Rye' over on Sahara and Valley View,  'Todd English P.U.B.', at the Crystals Shopping with Aria and more recently 'Public House' at The Venetian. All offer a dining experience with lots of great food, great mixed cocktails and most with an extensive beer list. The food offerings are all similar with fresh shellfish at many,  braised and pickled meats, and often rich delicious dessert items.   Enter Culinary Dropout.  Described as a Gastro Pub with 'Amp'd Up Food Fare', the newest addition to the pub scene also includes some pretty amazing classic style cocktails, as well as some more original bar offerings, and a tasty wine list.   Among my favorite - the \"Smashed Irishmen' a concoction of Guinness, Jameson Irish Whiskey , Honey and Mint.. It's sweet and in my opinion, delicious is  truly an understatement. To go along with that, I had one of the most perfect Old Fashion Cocktails that I have ever experienced, finished with Luxardo Cherries and Fresh Orange.. I know, I know.. mixing liquor can be dangerous.. but seriously fun!   The food menu is just as varied. An antipasti menu with a superior selection of cheeses, cured meats and vegetables, as well as some very 'comfort-food' style selections. There is a delicious Fried Chicken with Fresh Buttermilk Biscuits,  Pan Seared  Trout with an Almond Butter Sauce, and even a version Panag-Style Chicken Curry with Potatoes. For the slightly more foodie adventurous, Id say to give the Jambalaya shot.. House Made Andouille Sausage, Shrimp and Chicken.. with Pablano Peppers.. sure to set your mouth on fire.   For dessert.. I'd have to say the Salted Caramel Custard topped with fresh Caramel Popcorn is my absolute favorite, but the Chocolate Peanut Butter Tart comes in close second.   Whatever you end up with, Culinary Dropout has a nice hold on the idea of a place really being fun. Live music, great scenery and quality food and drink. You will find me here often I think. Happy Eating!",

Thank you Sam! ;) I will upload a pic.  Their cocktail menu is fun and varied! I forgot the name of my cocktail but it was made with champagne and ginger, delish!  We unleashed our inner fat girls, and at Sam's recommendation, ordered a variety of menu items:  Raw Bar: -Oysters -Black mussels -King Crab Legs  Appetizers: -Artichoke -Pretzel bread and cheese fondue -Gorgonzola chicken salad  Entrees: -Salmon with apples -Rainbow trout -36 hour ribs  Dessert: -Apple Monkey Bread  WOW everything so good!! My favorite bites were the selections from the raw bar, especially the black mussles, the broth was so flavorful! I also really liked the 36 hour ribs, the sauce was so rich and delicious.  That said, I think the best bite of the night was the apple monkey bread. It came in a cast iron skillet with a scoop of ice cream on the side. If your favorite cinnamon roll and your favorite bread pudding had a love child, it would be Culinary Dropout's apple monkey bread!  Service was fantastic, we had numerous waiters and staff being very attentive to us.  I can't wait to come back, thank you again for treating us so well Sam! xoxo",

There was a live band playing some fun covers for entertainment so the atmosphere here is great.  We ordered the pretzels and fondue, a selection of meats, the smoked salmon spread, and the pork belly toast. All of it was fantastic and I have no complaints.  Great food, service, and environment. I loved it here and would definitely go back.",

We walked into the Hard Rock casino no clue where we were heading and saw The Culinary Drop Out!  We were quickly seated and our waitress appeared right from the beginning to be on top of it!  Our table had an amazing view of the pool and cabanas! The decor was super cool with what appeared to have a garage warehouse look and feel!  We ordered appetizers for the table, soft pretzel bites with cheese fondu dip and we also asked for a side of honey mustard and we also ordered homemade chips with French onion dip as well and the table loved them! It was perfect.  Our super awesome waitress took our lunch order and four of the five of us ordered there salads and there's always that one who gets the burger! LOL!  Our salads were perfect! I had the crispy shrimp ceaser salad and it was amazing!  AN had the strawberry and kale salad and she loved it as well! But we both kept eyeing that Pub Burger across the table that looked sooooo good! The Culinary Drop Out in Las Vegas at The Hard Rock was amazing, the food, the service and the ambiance were all perfect! And for Las Vegas the prices were good too! I recommend trying them out and we will come back!",

Pink taco managed to, within 3 minutes, make us feel so uncomfortable we left.   Luckily, we went next door to the culinary dropout. Where we sat at the bar and was greeted by a very nice bartender Felicia. We got the baked pretzels with melted provolone cheese-amazing. Then we kept it light with their \"cheap house salad\"-the ranch dressing was outstanding.   Felicia and Matt were absolutely amazing, you can tell they both enjoy their jobs. You just don't really see that with bartenders/servers working on the strip.   Needless to say, we said BYE FELICIA TO PINK TACO.   ....AND HELLO FELICIA at CULINARY DROP OUT.",

We had 7 people so we got to try a bunch of things: For appetizers we had the pretzels, and a plate of prosciutto and a plate of one of their cheeses. All were so good we couldn't stop. They were out of the Burrata, which sounded awesome.  I had the fried chicken, yum! Mashed potatoes and gravy that came with it were ok but not as good as chicken.  Good beers as well. We went back two nights later, and it was good once again.",

I had a turkey pastrami sandwich on a pretzel bun with french fries :-). Everything about my meal was delicious. I didn't want to leave anything on my plate!!  My server was awesome. He was efficient and kind to this single female sitting in his section.  Loved the fact that the restaurant is directly by the pool. They do have a section of tables outside with fire pits, but it was closed during the day due to wind (which is the reason for the missing star -- if I asked, and there is a server present, you should let me sit outside).  There is another location in Phoenix, but I don't know if it is as good! :-)",

The Yelp reviews are mostly raving, so I may in the minority. But had I not been staying in the Hard Rock, I wouldn't have made a bee-line to eat here.  That being said, I think it's a great bar. Great selection, the signature cocktails and mixed drinks are killer - great flavors and creativity. Just wouldn't plan on eating here when there are so many other great restaurants in Vegas.   A bit lacking in the service department, too.",

I got the fried chicken dish and it wasn't bad my any means but it wasn't amazing either. The sides were pretty bland (mashed potatoes and green beans). The fried chicken itself was better than the sides, but again nothing to write home about. Since I went on a Thursday night around 6 (early dinner for Vegas) the restaurant was pretty empty and the service was average (after the order was placed and the food came out and we were done eating it took awhile to round up the bill). Probably wouldn't come back since there are soooooooo many other places I want to try in Las Vegas and overall it is mediocre at best in my opinion. Also they don't have a bathroom in the restaurant so if you need to relieve yourself you have to walk out of the restaurant and through the casino to find the bathroom!",

The smoky flavor was present, but not overwhelming.  I could have had 3, except for the fact that it was pretty darn strong.  For $10 a pop, I enjoyed that it had a little kick to it.    I ordered a chicken sandwich because our waiter told us that all the bread was house made and raved about the sandwiches.  It was good, but nothing to write home about.  My two brunch partners got salad, which they said were very tasty.    If you're staying at the Hard Rock, I'd definitely give this place a try.  It offers something a little different from the steakhouses and sushi bars.",

We got the pretzels and cheese fondue. Let me just say: to DIE for. Seriously. I could probably just eat that as a meal. Pretzels are big and soft nuggets with just enough salt. The cheese fondue is perfecttttt.  I got a crispy shrimp Caesar salad. Pretty good, but then again, I've never had any sort of Caesar salad I didn't like. My boyfriend got the prime rib sandwich I think it was? Some sort of steak and cheese. The bread was nice and soft, not all hard and crusty like most rolls I've had/seen. Meat was tender and the cheese was good. I had one fry, wasn't impressed.   All in all, I loved it all. The service was good. Atmosphere was nice. Good was good.

I savored the entire experience. It is fun and hip, with 5 star food offerings! The service was superb and every single employee was gracious and a pro.   Not only will I eat there every single time I have an opportunity, it is now on my \"tour\" when we have out of town loved ones to entertain! It's that satisfying!   Particular favs were the Pub Burger and the Soft Pretzels. Mmmmmmmm perfect! They make delicious cocktails too!",

We had 3 entrees including the 36 hour ribs (best ribs we've found in Vegas), fried chicken (had a honey glaze that was fantastic), and the Italian Grinder (a fresh slaw that was light and full of flavor). All the meals were wonderful! Our party all agreed we would be back and we would order the same food again. Environment was clean and extremely comfortable. Our server Devin, who recommended several of the items we ordered with honesty, was and is pleasant, knowledgeable, and a great asset to this restaurant. He enhanced our experience with his high level service! Kudos all around!!!!",

Food is superb. I get grilled chicken on pretzel bun with fries every time. Not stingy with the chicken and the ranch is TO DIE FOR.  I DO NOT like cheese with my pretzels, but the cheese sauce that comes with the pretzel bites appetizer is just such a beautiful harmony of flavors in my mouth.   My sister got the fried chicken and said it was the best ever. Moist and well seasoned.   They did have a blueberry cider beer when we went months ago, not sure if they still have it. But, it was really good.  DESSERT: Salted caramel custard with homemade caramel popcorn. It is life. It is just perfect and beautiful and fulfilling and ..... just RIGHT! It is the best dessert I've had in Las Vegas. If I could eat this every night I would. When I come here I get dessert there and 1...sometimes 2 to go!",

Two of our team members had the Korean Ribeye and both of them raved about it.  Two had the meat loaf.  Two had hamburgers.  One thing that makes or breaks a hamburger for me is the bun - it has to hold up for the duration of the meal.  Their buns are golden and delicious - I think they fresh Brioche.  One team member had a Nacho plate that looked to die for.  And I had the fried chicken (I'm talking about \"on-the-bone\" chicken leg, thigh, and breast).  Making fried chicken to order is not an easy feat.  That's why most restaurants don't offer fried chicken.  I come from the South, where fried chicken is a main-stay, so my expectations were high.  Culinary Dropout didn't let me down.  The chicken was cooked to perfection, golden brown, honey-drizzled and served with mashed potatoes and a fresh, home-made biscuit.  It was an outstanding experience.  I plan to go back and have the Korean BBQ.",

We also had prosciutto, super tasty, very fresh and seemed high quality. I had the Korean Style steak something, I forget the name of it because I was so  obsessed with how delicious it was!  Super tender, juicy, flavorful....yum! My Dad had fried chicken, which we all agreed was the best fried chicken we had ever had, seriously the best I've ever had in my life. For dessert we shared monkey bread, my parents said it was a little undercooked, which was their only critique of the night, but that's exactly how I like, so no complaints here.  We also had the caramel custard with caramel corn on top, which was fantastic.  The crunch of the popcorn on top with the creamy custard underneath was a great combination.   I'm not a big drinker, but we tried some pretty cool cocktails, my favorite was the bloody mary with the bacon strip in lieu of the celery.   I also loved the atmosphere, really pretty chandeliers and lights, big comfy chairs, and cool industrial vibe.   Can't wait to go back....might actually go tonight!",

I highly recommend the Room Service drink and Bourbon Black Bottom Pie if all you want is desert and a drink. Whether you sit outside on the patio next to a fire pit by the pool or inside at the rough hewn wooden community tables, this place is worth a visit if your in Vegas at the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino.",

The Fried Chicken was incredible-the batter was something like i have never tasted...needed NO sauce at all. The pretzel and cheese fondue app was okay...but if an option just get the pretzels. The cheese is nothing special, very bland w no taste at all. the view is what sets it off.",

Also, the fried chicken is probably the best fried chicken I've ever had.  Actually, scratch out \"probably\"....it definitely was!  Note that I also discovered that fried chicken and champagne compliment each other very well! Or at least at this place anyway.",

    "text": "Might be our best meal in Vegas YET! My wife and I ate here at 5pm right before going to a concert at the Joint. Was perfect. In and out in just under an hour. Atmosphere is really slick. Feels like fine dining but without all the pretense that can get old after being in Vegas for a week.   I would recommend sitting inside. If it's available, the tables that have the leather sofa on one side and a living-room-style padded arm chair on the other side are awesome. You can watch the guys on the line and the wait staff at the pass. Love that they're all in plain clothes and while being very professional, also, being very approachable.   So for the food... We started with the Warm Pretzel fondue appetizer. HIGHLY recommend. Especially if you're going to get a burger, because you can use the leftover cheese for your fries! I ordered the Pub Burger which had bacon, havarti & BBQ sauce. SO good. Bun was so fresh and had a great crust on it. Almost like a pretzel as well, but not too hard. Cooked to a PERFECT medium. Was very pleased. Fries weren't much to get excited about, but when using that Cheese fondue, they became amazing.  My wife had the Beef Stroganoff. It was A+. Beef was so lean and mushrooms were delicious. I love that on the menu they straight-up say \"Frozen Peas\". HA! Again, NO pretense.   For drinks, I had a Batch 19 Pre Prohibition style lager & my wife had a Smashed Irishman cocktail that she thoroughly enjoyed. I loved that their cocktail menu had silhouette pictures of the style of cup it would come in. They are also sorted into themed pages where each offering on the page is the same price. Very handy.  Didn't save room or time for desert, but the Peanut Butter Chocolate something or other will be on the menu when we make it back next vist to Las Vegas.",

Sitting at the bar and waiting a little bit for a table (30-40 mins w/o reservations, 10-15 with, on a Friday night) is fine with me - the meats and cheeses being sliced behind the bar smell amazing!  I LOVE the atmosphere; the decor in here represents my dream great room/patio. It's industrial and dark on the inside with a sizable patio right beyond garage style doors. The strands of lights outside are quaint and there is a living wall with mirrors hanging from it on the left, love it. They do, of course, play rock music, even with that though, the overall vibe is very calm.  The Beer: not a huge selection, but a good selection. I had some Moose Drool and my husband had Abita Amber. The Food: those meats and cheese I've already mentioned are a great way to start your meal. They give you a list when you are seated and you can choose what you'd like and how much (exactly how you would order rolls at a sushi place). I had the Pub Burger for my entree, it was great! Whether for drinks or dinner, I recommend this place!",

Will come back and try other items because my friends food looked amazing as well and the said it was.

My friend and I came here for dinner, and while the atmosphere was nice, and the service was good, the food left a lot to be desired.  We ordered an antipasti plate with a meat, cheese, and the crusty bread and olive oil, which were fine, but what sucked was that they brought it out at the same time as our mains!  It's called an antipasti for goodness sakes, it's supposed to come out Before the main course.  Another issue was with the mains.  My friend had the Bistro Steak, and he ordered it medium rare, but we're both pretty sure that it came out rare, but it was so covered in sauce that it was hard to tell.  It was also cool when it came out, which was weird.  I had the pork belly cubano sandwich, which was tasty, but super oily.  I'm pretty sure they cooked the bread on the griddle with butter, because while the edges were crunchy, the center was still a little soggy and greasy.  I also wish they had used more of the spicy mustard and pickles, because after the pork belly, those two were my favorite parts of the sandwich.  Overall, 3 stars for service and ambiance, and 2 stars for food.",

The Pretzel appetizer with fondue was one of the most simple but tastiest appetizers I've had in a while, and all the entrees were at least ok. Where this place absolutely falls apart is the service.   Our waitress was very nice and even treated me to a drink for my 21st, but it took almost 20 minutes to get our drinks and we were never given refills. Our appetizer took another 30 min and finally the entree took a ridiculously long 50 minutes. Combine that with the limited menu and I can't go past 2 stars. The drink was tasty though",

The place has such a homey feel to it that my wife and I enjoyed it right off the bat.  We had the pretzel and provolone cheese dip for an appetizer.  This thing was just phenomenal.  The pretzel, seasoned with sea salt, comes out with a nice provolone dip.  The pretzel was great with or without the dip.    We had the Korean Ribeye Cap.  This thing blew my wife and me away.  The meat was so tender and juicy.  They cooked this thing where everything was perfect.  The spice, the vegetables, the seasoning, the meat; everything came together for a perfect blend.  This is the one thing I would recommend everyone trying.  For dessert we had the monkey bread.  Like someone else already posted if you wanted a bread pudding mixed with your favorite cinnamon roll this would be it.  Everything is great, the price is reasonable (especially considering this is Vegas), the waiters are very attentive, and the cooks are great.  Like I said this has become a staple visit every time I come out to Vegas.",

    "text": "so, we were here about a month ago and had probably one of the worst experiences at any restaurant. However, we came back and had a much better experience.   First of all, we like to thank Mike for inviting us back so we can give this new place a second chance. Secondly, thank you to Alyssa and Erica for making our experience that much better than the first.  Alyssa really knew her food knowledge and was really great at checking up on us. Erica came back several times to make sure we were enjoying ourselves and even the food runners knew where to drop off food, which was a challenge for them the last time we were here. Overall, we had a great time and are definitely making this place a go to spot.  Now, on to more important business, the food. Here's the break down:  1st course: Pretzel and cheese fondue and burrata. You can't go wrong with cheese and pretzels, especially when its fondue. Warm pretzel and cheese, definitely a plus. This app is also great for sharing if you're here with a big group. Burrata, OMG! We've had burrata served all sorts of way but it's definitely the best here. Served with toasty bread and chimichurri, what a combination. It's a little sweet and salty and the burrata adds this creamy and cool element, you have to try this when you're here. This is the perfect deconstruction of a caprese salad.  2nd course: Rainbow trout and the Ribeye cap. Rainbow trouts don't  get enough credits if you ask me. This mild white fish is perfect for grilling and pairing with some intense flavors. Here, it is served with some green beans and toasted almonds. The flavor of the fish gets a chance to be the star because the other elements are soft and enhances the flavor instead of overpowering it. But, the star of this course is the Ribeye cap. It was so tendered and all the flavors were wonderful. Asian inspired so you get a little spicy, a little sweet and a little salty. They're already sliced so consuming them was that much easier. If you're a cilantro (coriander), ask for extra. The flavor adds a little bitterness that goes really well with it.  3rd course: Monkey Bread. You all know that I love a good dessert. And this time, we didn't run out of time. It's baked to order so give it a little time to get to your table. It's piping hot when it arrives and you have to eat this with your hands. You pull apart these tiny brioche that is soaked in cinnamon and sugar. It was good. Its a good pull a part version of a cinnamon bun. It was a little too sweet for me so luckily I had some pretty strong coffee to sip on.  Ciao and until next time, happy eating everyone :)",

    "text": "On the outside, Culinary Dropout looks like it's going to be an All-American bar where  food and drinks shoot out from the back and the music blares in the front. It's not necessarily the opposite, but it's definitely an upper-scale version of what a good dinner restaurant should be.   We came here with no expectations and left with full stomachs and smiles on our faces. We had the grilled artichoke (which had a great dipping sauce), cheese and prosciutto (plenty to share) for appetizers, and my friend got the Bistro Steak (on the small side but still filling) and I got the Jambalaya (spicy and full of sausage and seafood).   We capped it off with a Monkey Bite, which is essentially a cinnamon roll crammed into a bed of baked apple and served with a scoop of ice cream. It was amazing. And delicious. And it was probably what put the restaurant over the top when it came to the food.   Our server was attentive and didn't make things awkward. We didn't feel like we were being checked on every 2 minutes.   Something to note is that the employees here don't have a uniform - they're free to dress in whatever way makes them feel comfortable. We used this as a conversation starter and learned a lot about our waiter.   I'll definitely be coming back here again: Great service, good food, happy stomachs.

    "text": "This place was a joke.  Talk about trying way to hard to be what some 55 year old guy in Scottsdale thinks is \"cool\" these days...  This is Urban Outfitters in restaurant form, which might be forgivable if the food was any good or the menu cohesive.  For a \"gastropub\", the beer list was pretty pedestrian and the beer menu was inanely laid out.  The menu was all about clever, pseudo-hipster layout and not at all about conveying information about the beers.  On tap they have Lagunitas, but which Lagunitas?  They make several different brews.  The food was again trying way too hard to be trendy.  Unfortunately the gastropub trend jumped the shark 5 years ago, as evidenced by this pre-packaged chain restaurant.  In fact I think that this incarnation of a gastropub, cooked up by some restaurant company in that culinary mecca (and launching pad of a dozen chain restaurant monstrosities) of Scottsdale, AZ, may be the ultimate and final indicator of the gastropub shark jump.  The douchey beats from the pool outside pound through the restaurant and are beyond annoying.  The pretzels were stale and the cheese sauce they came with was grainy with too much flour in the bechamel.  The chicken curry was laughably bland with a couple of strands of dried up chicken breast and no rice (i took this one to go.)  This place is so derivative and contrived.  Simon Kitchen, First Food, and Society are already doing the comfort-retro food much better and don't need to package their menus in some goofy, obvious appeal to a specific demographic (except for First, which is itself an overly-conceived douchatoreum, but with slightly better food than CD).  The funny thing is that they are obviously trying to appeal to Brooklyn-hipster types, the exact people who wouldn't be caught dead in the HRH, let alone this charicature of a restaurant.  One extra star for the cool couches.",

According to their website, Culinary Dropout is a gastropub created by Fox Restaurant Concepts.  The first time I encountered a Fox restaurant was in Tucson, AZ with Wildflower and it was amazing.  Food was fresh.  Flavors were well-rounded and the decor and staff were very attractive.  =)  Our experience with Culinary Dropout Las Vegas proved to be product of the brains behind Fox.  Though a different type of restaurant all together, all the details similar to my experience at Wildflower came together.  The service was impeccable (waters filled constantly, all staff checking on you, very smartly dressed in hobo chic for girls and vests for guys).  The food was fatty, delicious and well thought out.  The decor was romantic, whimsical and relaxing, so much so that I felt like I was in an episode of The Hills reality show.  Definitely a date night place or nice cozy hang out with your friends.  Foood. 1.  Soft Pretzels with Provolone Fondue - Usually not a fan of pretzels, but theses lil' guys were fluffy and perfectly salted and hard to resist once dipped in the warm pot of cheese. 2.  Grilled Cheese Sliders with bacon and tomato - Baby sliders!  Just as tasty as they were cute. 3.  Jambalaya - Well rounded, robust and perfectly sauce.  Best jambalaya yet? oooo 4.  Fried Chicken with honey biscuits, potatoes and gravy - Nothing can beat fried chicken at Ad Hoc in Napa, but this chicken platter had it's own character.  The breading was delicate, light and uniquely seasoned (cumin, my friend Tina says?).  The honey biscuits were slightly sweet and fluffy; I totally commandeered the rest of said friend's biscuits. 5.  The Pub Burger with havarti, bacon and house bbq sauce - Big burger = Big flavor.  Nice moist burger patty with sweet smokey bbq sauce. 6.  Monkey Bread - Ooey gooey, warm and comforting  Conclusion:  I'm coming back to hang out when I want feel trendy and eat well.  p.s.  For the HGTV addicts, we saw Antonio Ballatore and got a picture with him!",

    "text": "I was here on the 1st official night they were open (not the soft opening or the VIP party).  I have to say, I was impressed at how smoothly everything seemed to be running.  I didn't get to see the entire restaurant, but what I did see was really cool.  I sat at the 1st bar when you walk in the place.  The stool was really uncomfortable - there needs to be a footrest ON the stool, not just under the counter.  The server/bartenders who assisted me were very friendly and seemed genuinely excited about the products they were serving.  They have a good beer selection, something that is just now starting to happen more often in Vegas.  The bartender told  me that it is very important to them, the company started in PHX, who has a great beer scene.  The drink prices were a little high, but that is to be expected for the location.  I had the \"cheap house salad\" and the pretzels with fondue.  Both only took a few minutes before they were delivered.  And both were really delicious.  The salad comes standard with ranch dressing, and was tossed perfectly (not too much or too little dressing).  There were tomatoes and onions chopped up in it, along with some other stuff.  Now, the pretzels were AMAZING and totally worth comnig back for.  I don't know how they do it, but the cheese fondue that is served with them is absolutely orgasmic.  The pretzels are great for sharing, and are served in a paper lined dish.  The fondue comes in a small, individual pot with a candle underneath.  They were seriously SO good.  The menu is really diverse and there are so many different areas of the place, I think that there is something for everyone.  There is also a patio that looks down into the pool, so there is definitely some good people watching to be had here.  :)  I can't wait to go back and try some of their entress (and of course get more pretzels).  Everyone was so friendly and I really like the concept of the place.  Hopefully they are around for awhile, I hear they have quite a following in Phoenix.",

Overall the dinner menu is not too extreme but the food is still at to above average but the phenomenal drinks, trendy vibes, and super friendly service totally make it worth it.   I actually enjoyed the pretzel cheese fondue but the burrata, that was amazeballs. It's a semi soft slightly sweet cheese with chimichurri and marinated tomatoes. It's like a Spanish version of a bruschetta. Definitely try it.   The fried chicken is phenom... Hang on to the cheese from the pretzel fondue, it's good for dippin!  I had the pork belly sandwich and it was thick cut, juicy, and tender.   Favorite drinks: honestly I'm more of a red ale, malbec, and straight up martini kind of guy, but this is one place I have ventured a bit... At least so far as trying everyone else's drinks. That counts!  Drunken Irishmen, clown punch, malbec. YUM",

    "text": "I really really wanted to love this place (more than just the average 3 stars). Awesome decor/ambiance, plenty of room for large parties, live music, and Ben (our server) was super nice.   We were starving and got 2 appetizers that came out very quickly. The Pretzel bites were yummy, but the portion was way too large for 2 people. It's too bad they don't have 2 sizes & prices to choose from. Their profit margin on this item is crazy. Anyway, the Deviled eggs were the highlight of the whole meal since it was made with truffle oil. If you add that to anything, I guess it would be delicious in my opinion. ;)  Anyway, we decided to try the Ribs as an entree since the description was so enticing as well as Ben recommended it. Being from the South, we definitely had very high expectations. Unfortunately, instead of being marinated for 36 hours in a great sauce, it tasted like a it was locked in the Salt Mines for days. I had 1 rib and couldn't eat anymore cause it required a glass of water to cure my thirst after that bite. It was really disappointing. I would have thought that they would have taken it off the bill and the manager came by, but was so awkward and didn't even acknowledge anything.   The dinner started off so good and ended so strangely. It is a \"hip/trendy\" place and maybe we'll come back, but it could just be for drinks/patio in the future. Let's see. Hopefully, it gets better as the comments come rolling in.",

    "text": "I have had the enthusiastic suggestion to visit Culinary Dropout from quite a few people, and today I decided to indulge. upon entering the restaurant, on the right, you are faced with a long hallway covered in black and white pictures of chefs, food, and various other gastronomical items. to the left of the podium is an oyster bar. The chairs and  tables have almost a rustic / disheveled look to them. each table has their own set of seat backs and seats that don't match the others. There are large glass chandeliers hanging above the larger tables, and I counted 3 small fire pits on the patio. There is also a full service bar to the right of the dining room.  I was offered a seat at the bar, but requested a table in the dining area. After being seated a waitress by the name of Rae (I hope I remember correctly) approached, greeted, and sat down at the table to discuss the menu (since it was my first visit.)  This is the type of hospitality and customer service that I really look for in a restaurant. After explaining what she liked and helping me through some of the things I fancied, we both decided that she would just bring some food and I would eat. When the food arrived it was just simple food on a plate. no pretentious arrangements, no rediculous garnish, that's not intended to be eaten, just good food prepared well.  Her attentiveness is really what made the experience for me. Super down to earth/chill people, showing that you actually care for guests is what sets this place apart.  After paying the bill I was even give a to-go beverage, when again, I didn't ask for or expect, but it was the thought that counted.  I would highly recommend this place, especially during happy hour.",

The biscuit was cold as were the mashed potatoes.  With so many other options in Vegas skip this one.",

I sent my food back as I had lost my appetite after the drink and bad app. The manager offered to make it right I told him not to worry it just took forever. He still charged us for everything! Not even comping my bad mary!!!",

Smaller portions than you would expect.   And the fried chicken. Salty, like really salty. Biscuit was over cooked. Mashed potatoes were more salt.

I get the dark ambiance of the Hard Rock and every business within it, but I should at least be able to see my menu without having to whip out my phone for a light source. That being said, nothing on the menu stands out.  They're really pushing the pretzel fondue, but the table next to us got it and it didn't look appealing. Prosciutto deviled eggs sounded awesome but were in reality a let down- I guess for $4/order, that shouldn't surprise me, but the \"prosciutto\" was more like bacon bits than any other meat I've had.   Italian antipasto salad makes a decent and filling lunch, with ample protein and a tasty dressing. But the \"yesterday's soup\", chicken tortilla, is basic- I mean, at least add some sort of garnish for $7/bowl. Chicken was a bit spicier than expected but overall the dish fell flat.  The only thing saving this review was friendly service. But I can't eat service... Menu has no direction and the food received did not interest me enough to warrant ordering an entree or returning.  NOTE: HH is from 3-6PM,Mon-Fri. But good luck getting a HH menu, no one seems to want to give them out. Maybe just cancel it if you don't want to honor it?",

    "text": "After going to a concert at The Joint, I checked Yelp for a decent restaurant closeby and found Culinary Dropout. Based on Yelp reviews, I had some high hopes for this place. Boy was I disappointed!   First of all, the meats/cheese board is ridiculously overpriced. We ordered a few different types of  cheese and meat ($7 each, $5 each) and the portions were incredibly tiny. I asked the waiter \"Is this it?\" and come to find out, each portion is only 1.5 oz. You gotta be kidding me !! $5 or $7 dollars for 1.5 oz of meat or cheese is just ridiculous. I get that this is Vegas, but the meat/cheese wasn't special at all.  Second, the sandwich (Chicken Club) was good, but nothing to write home about. $14 dollars is fairly comparable to what I would pay at home, so I have no complaints about price on that.  The best thing was the pretzel and cheese dip. I would come back just for that dip plus a drink.  As far as beer list, 20oz Ninkasi tricerahops was $10! WHAAAA? Most cocktails priced at $12, so go for a cocktail if you come here.  Also, who decided that it was a good idea to skip adding a bathroom and use the preexisting bathroom  on the casino floor?",

On my first visit I ordered my go-to, a Rogue Dead Guy, and the Steamed Mussels which were AWESOME. The portion was much bigger than expected, and the broth was flavorful and packed with herbs and chorizo, accompanied with a side of toasted bread for dipping.   I took some friends from out of town here last weekend, thinking we could get some good food in a fun place that wouldn't break the bank. I was nervous in reserving a table for 8 at the last minute, but upon walking in at 9:15pm, I noticed that there was hardly anyone there, much like my first visit. The restaurant is huge, with a large outdoor space, but I don't know why there is never anyone there! Our server was awesome and so friendly and patient with a bunch of hooligans at the table, I regret not being able to remember his name.   My friend and I shared the pretzel bites and provolone fondue which were fun, and generously sized. The pretzel bites were soft and warm, I think our table ordered 4 orders, they were that popular! We also split the buffalo chicken meatballs which I wasn't a huge fan of, they were slightly tough and dry. The smoked salmon salad was more like cooked salmon that had been infused with a smoky flavor, versus cured, smoked, salmon aka lox. It was still good, and came with some melba toast type crackers for spreading, but wasn't entirely what I envisioned.   Given the size of the venue, the huge stage available for live music, and the patio, there is so much potential for an awesome dinner/drinks experience. Book bands! Do beer tastings! Pingpong outside?",

No communication whatsoever. I finally had to ask if that was all and she looked at me like I was dumb then said \"yeah.\" OK, I guess the usual \"we'll call you when its ready\" or \"it'll be so and so minutes\" weren't in her vocabulary.  We came back after 15 minutes and were seated outside where it was nice. Then another 10 minutes of waiting for someone to take our order because they were severely understaffed even though it wasn't that busy. Our waitress was amazing though and that was probably the only good thing.   Fish and chips were pretty oily and the fries just soaked up the oil. My friend got the burger that came out almost cold raw in the middle. Bloody mary's were mediocre. I'd definitely eat elsewhere.",

Only complaints were that service was a little slow and someone in my group ordered tabasco sauce when we ordered our meal and didn't come so we had to wait. The server didn't really make any recommendations or have much to say about the menu at all (we asked).   Would certainly return for dinner.",

I always avoid any chain, tourist trap restaurant. We are staying at the Hard Rock and we didn't want to hit the strip. We ended up at Culinary Dropout after looking at yelp. We sat at the open air bar. Dylin Lujan was our bartender. He is one of the best we've ever had. He answered our questions about some unique drinks they had, gave me tastes of some of their liqueurs and homemade mixers, and was very attentive, as was his barback. Prices for food and drinks are reasonable, quality is exceptional.  We had the pretzels and provolone fondue, kale salad, and monkey bread for dessert, along with 3 signature cocktails. Taste the falernum liqueur. The old fashioned was excellent, and the \"Pistols at Dawn\" is a sangria style mule. Adam the general manager came around and was super friendly. This was not your typical Vegas experience. Great place. Staff are all proud of the fine crafted food from scratch they offer, and the pride they have in their product shows.  We will be back tomorrow.",

The seating is comfortable with a view of the pool. We didn't get a chance to sit outside as it was 105 degrees. We were a group of three girls so it may seem like a lot of food but it was so good not to finish lol only a few Pretzel bites were spared.  Food - Pretzel bites with cheese fondue: the first time around they didn't bring out enough cheese so we had to ask for another pot of cheese fondue.  BBQ Pork belly nachos: De-li-ciousss! I just wish they would shred the pork instead of bigger chunks as its hard sharing with a group.  Grilled cheese sliders - It only comes with three. Toasted, cheesy, warm, what more can u ask for? It also came with fries.  Truffle potato chips- OMG. These are a must have every time! Try dipping them in the fondue cheese. Ah-mazing!  Dessert - We had the Bourbon Black Bottom Pie & Caramel Salted Custard. Both delicious but the custard takes the lead.",

    "text": "Had dinner here last time I stayed at the Hard Rock and had a great time. I really liked the seating area and how it was laid out. Big open area with large tables for groups and small intimate tables on the outer edges for the one on one dates. Bar seating is also available and is pretty lively. I saw a little stage set up for a small band - looked cool.  Ok now for the best part - FOOOOD! So many things looked good on the menu. I ultimately went for the nachos. I am a sucker for nachos if they are described as loaded with toppings - yes pork belly was a eye catcher. While in the midst of getting my drank on it was a wise choice. Well they came thru - the nachos were excellent. Loaded with slow BBQ pork, black beans, guac, pico and a pretty interesting cheese sauce. The plate was large too - totally a entree on its own. Very flavorful and evenly mixed toppings, I wasn't left with a pile of chips after.   I was also eyeing the fried chicken, it was touted as a restaurant fav. Luckily it was ordered at our table too and I was able to get a bite. Woah yes this was very good too. Again no shortage on flavor. Seemed pressure cooked with a crunch. Huge sized pieces along with mashed potatoes and gravy and coleslaw. A real BBQ picnic style plate here. A bit greasy but it is fried chicken after all. The meat is really tender and savory. A biscuit was also brought along side and that even was down right good.   Oh and a friend ordered the roasted brussels sprouts. Ehh I wasn't looking for this tonight but glad I gave them a try. They would probably make someone who didn't like brussels sprouts actually like them. They were really good.  I was completely stuffed by the end of the meal and as far as I am concerned they nailed it with the nachos and fried chicken. Our waitress was great and took good care of our group. If I stay at the Hard Rock I will definitely eat here again.",

It is casual but very cool, the waitress sat next to me to answer my question about the menu, it was awesome !   The food was good too, we had the turkey pastrami which was very unique, and the salmon was very good too but portion was a little too small. The chocolate/pecan dessert was good too but too sweet. Overall a good experience, will be back :)",

    "text": "I was here back in December 2015, and I remember wanting to write this review, but not being able to remember for the life of me what this place was called... and then I totally forgot about it.   Well, today, I was cleaning out my purse and came across the receipt with the server's name on it - RaeAnne. Or maybe that was the cashier? I had the loveliest waitress from Chicago, and when I came across the receipt, I remembered her and my experience here and I smiled.   I was pretty hungover and on my own, and I ordered the pulled pork nachos. They were AWESOME! Perfect hangover food. Really great, trendy \"fresh mex\" nachos. I had a mediocre coffee too. But all coffee in America was mediocre to bad, so I can't hold it against this place. There was hardly anybody else in the place at the time - it was about 3pm.   My waitress sat with me and talked about Vegas and life and she was so nice and so warm and down to earth, that 6 months later, I looked at my receipt and felt all warm and fuzzy remembering that grey afternoon. A+ experience here, all the way.  It's an ultra chic and trendy, very large restaurant inside the Hard Rock Hotel (where I was staying). Apparently they do a great bloody mary and other cocktails, and have one of those menus with things like burgers, nachos and other more varied items... its an upmarket  \"something for everyone\" spot.",

    "text": "We came to Culinary Dropout after reading Yelp reviews, and if I'm being honest, also because I like the name. It was my first time at the Hard Rock Casino and Hotel. We parked in the garage and that entrance wasn't a far walk to the restaurant. We decided to dine on the patio and enjoy the nice weather. Maybe we should have chosen an inside table because the music was blaring out of the speakers. Seriously, the music was disturbingly loud, and I wasn't able to properly enjoy the meal or atmosphere. Also, we were there during Happy Hour but specials weren't offered that day because there was a concert in the city later that night. Keep that in mind if you're going specifically for HH. On to the food. We ordered several appetizers.  Soft Pretzels & Provolone Fondue- good; but a huge, very filling portion.  Cheddar & Pork Cracklings- very good; light and airy, great flavor, my favorite out of them all  Strawberries, Brie, & Pistachio- ok; prefer them served colder Sherry Glazed Beets & Goat Cheese- ok; if you like beets, then try them with goat cheese Crusty Bread, Garlic Oil & Balsamic- ok; basic bread, flavors didn't stand out Oysters (1/2 dozen)- good; if you like them, you know what to expect The Soiled Dove (cocktail)- very good; I like the individual can of Jose Cuervo they gave me Overall, an okay experience here.  A few adjustments are needed, but I would give it another try.",

I sat at the bar (since I am solo on this trip) and immediately ordered a craft beer. I went to the strip yesterday and paid 8.50 for craft beer so it was nice to find a decent menu here with beers for 5.50 to 6 bucks. Also, they have this paper bag thing that lets you get a can of beer for 2.95. I have only been in Vegas for a couple of days and that seems like a good deal to me (regardless of what the beer might be).   I ordered for dinner the Italian grinder. It was good. I really enjoyed talking to my bartenders. I didn't ask for their names but both gentlemen were nice and willing to help me pick out a beer or a whiskey to sip. If you are at the Hard Rock, stop in the Culinary Drop out and Enjoy some live music, a couple of drinks and a good meal!",

Why nobody was taking advantage of the spectacular bar seating right up front was mind blowing. But it might have had something to do with the fact that their wasn't anyone working behind said bar. Details, details.  We sat towards the back at a giant table that fit all the foods. We went big ordered the fondue and pretzels, pierogis, and the smoked salmon. All of the above dishes were super rich and decadent. You get a lot of bang for your buck with those soft pretzels. I was able to wrap them up to go in the hopes of using them for little sliders at home. Alas, they were forgotten by me at the table but it's all good because you can't take food or drink from the outside world into the show. A few glasses of Sauvignon Blanc rounded out the whole experience.  The food at Culinary Dropout was memorable, the service was casual, and the overall vibe was exactly what I didn't know I needed before heading into Magic Mike Live.  Thank you Culinary Dropout. I'm not sure I could have done it without you.",

Everything else we had was pretty good as well. My only complaint and reason for 4 stars is not having more items on the menu.  The menu is limited. Prices are okay for a casino.

Pickled Sweet Peppers were mildy pickled, would've loved for it to be picklier, flavor was there though. Oysters were alright, would pass on this next time, but I rec the $3 white shrimp- just one to try though!   Wanted to try the 36 hr pork ribs and Fried Chicken but they RAN OUT OF BOTH? Wha the fudge. So opted for the Roasted Salmon and Thai Chili Chicken Wings. Both were actually pretty tasty, can't imagine how them ribs or chicken would taste.   I had the Pistols at Dawn drink with bourbon, ginger agave and a splash of red wine...interesting combo huh! Tasted almost like a whiskey smash bramble combo. Had a sip of the Old Fashioned...tasted a bit watered down..was a slight disappointment.   If I am at Hard Rock again, I'd come back!",

They had fire pits on so we asked if they can turn them off and they did. They were very accommodating and friendly. We looked over the menu and placed our drink orders. There drinks are a must try. We had the el matador that was made with tequila and my wife had the original drop out. They were both under the mule section but didn't come in copper mugs. Both very tasty and refreshing.   Pretzel bites w/ fondue - these were very tasty. You get pretzel balls with a side of cheese fondu. Dip the pretzel in that cheese and such a great combination. Just an FYI it's a lot of pretzel so if your a party of 3-4 then this is just right. Any less then 3 it's a lot of food.   Fried Chicken - the fried chicken looked amazing but something about the seasoning they use on the chicken I was not a fan of. It had like a sweet element to it that I really didn't enjoy. The chicken itself once past the sling was good and juicy. The buttermilk biscuit was ok and there was a side of mash potatoes that were a little to salty and some slaw that was just ok. My wife enjoyed it so give it a try you might too.   BBQ pork belly nachos - black beans, guacamole, sour cream and Pico de Gallo. On top of some crispy tortilla chips with chunks of pork belly. These were good and tasty and piel belly was very tender and good. Covered with some type of queso that tied everything together. I preferred these over the friend chicken.   If in the hard rock and looking for something to eat and grab a drink give this place a try.",

This place seemed like a nice little place mainly because of all the open outdoor seating that overlooks the pool in the casino tower.   Food was just okay. I ordered an ahi tuna salad which I thought would be nice pieces of ahi to dip with soy sauce wasabi along with a salad like the name says but what came was disappointing. The ahi was in many pieces and didn't seem super fresh actually. I ate half of the fish but the salad and dressing were pretty good.   As a table we had the pretzel with cheese dip which was just okay and the deviled eggs which were super creamy and delicious.",

He got the biscuits and gravy with eggs+bacon and I got the two eggs with bacon+toast. We also ordered the Cap'n Crunch French Toast because it sounded AWESOME. And man, was it! It was deliciously sweet, fluffy and tasted a lot like Cap'n Crunch! The onyl thing that would have made me happier is if there were bits of the cereal on top of it, not just raspberries and powdered sugar. So tasty though!  Everything else was pretty good, nothing to write home about. I was craving bacon which was great. My boyfriend said his biscuits and gravy were a little weird, but he didn't mind too much.   Really sweet, young server! An okay experience. I think we'll go again to check out a dinner or late night meal, we want to experience more.",

    "text": "It was still Restaurant Week, and my long-anticipated introduction to Culinary Dropout was about to occur.  After it was all over, I was pleasantly pleased by all I saw and ate.  Amid the fitting sounds of hard rock, the decor of the restaurant is very casual, but seating on a banquette and upholstered chair was comfortable, and servers were very friendly, efficient, and accommodating.  A request for a different salad dressing was immediately granted.  I began with Yesterday's Soup, which changes by the day.  To my relief, this was not like the leftovers of a college cafeteria's previous day's rejected offerings ground up and mixed with broth.  Ginger Soup was on tap on my dining day.  And, this colorful soup literally took my breath away.  I figured out why when I found out from my server that it contained Cilantro Jalapeno Pepper Sauce.  The soup was not very hot but quite spicy, but soon I got used to it and found the distinct taste of ginger to be intriguing.  Next up was a House Salad with many mixed greens and a generous supply of good Sherry Vinaigrette Dressing.  For my entree, I selected Ma . . . The Meatloaf!?!  Why it is so named I have no idea.  But this was great, very hot meatloaf with a ketchup coating accompanied by really fresh French Style Green Beans and Mashed Potatoes with Brown Gravy.  I also tried the Coleslaw, which was non-creamy and slightly sweet, while Diane enjoyed somewhat odd-looking dark brown but quite tasty and well-made Fried Chicken with Mashed Potatoes and Honey Biscuits.  For dessert we had a Chocolate Toffee Tart and Salted Caramel Custard with homemade Caramel Popcorn on top.  Both were excellent, including the sweet popcorn.  It was fun to face and watch the chefs at work in the very open kitchen.  When we left, we were very full from the large portions.  Because the menu lists so many intriguing items that I want to try, including oysters and white shrimp by the piece, we will most definitely return fairly soon for additional meals--and will continue to do so if Diane keeps up her winning streak at the Hard Rock's slot machines and draws additional player's coupons for 2 for 1 entrees at Fu!",

Staff was casual but nice and took good care of us.   Drinks: ours took a little while but without asking our waiter gave us a complimentary mule to make up for it. I ordered the Smashed Irishman and my friend got the Soiled Dove. All three were amazing, super fresh, great quality.   Food: THE THAI CHILE WINGS. I was iffy on what to get because a lot looked good but I'm glad I got these. Probably the best wings I've ever had. Friend got a burger and she said that was one of the best she's had as well. I'd want to come back with a lot of people to get one of everything and get to taste more.   Dessert: Chocolate S'mores Pudding.....I mean do i have to say anything else? So so so good.  Prices: obviously the prices were not cheap but for the quality and location, I didn't mind at all.   All in all I left full and happy, wishing I didn't live in Texas so I could come here all the time. Definitely recommend!",

    "text": "This review is based on their fried chicken meal.  I love fried chicken.  I just love it.  This place has many highly rated online reviews.  I rarely get to eat fried chicken, so when I do, I want to savor the best.  The dish cost $22, which although it's high in price for fried chicken, I understand being in the Hard Rock Hotel carries a premium on everything. The dinner comes with a fresh made buttermilk biscuit, mashed potatoes w/gravy, slaw and half of a chicken cut up and fried.  Let me remind you, I absolutely love fried chicken.  I came during lunch, mid week, with about 4 tables sat in the venue, so it was not busy.  My chicken was either cooked too long and burnt, or the grease was very old.  After years of experience with fried chicken, I'm going to say the oil was old.  The batter they use is very light in flavor and spices. The chicken breast had many small broken bones, which I'm assuming came from where the wing was attached.  You don't get the wing, by the way.  The portion size for the breast, thigh and leg were all very small.  Such a disappointing fried chicken experience.   The buttermilk biscuit was doughy instead of flaky.  I was unable to enjoy it.  It had too much butter in the middle which made it even more dense.  The mashed potatoes had a very stale gravy flavoring.  Even the lemon in my drink was cut the previous day.  Nothing like getting a drink with a very old and dried lemon wedge to remind you that you're not enjoying fresh food.  When a restaurant cuts back by saving garnishes for the day, they are focused on the wrong thing....customer satisfaction and enjoyment.  A case of lemons in these hotels cost around $25 for approx 200 lemons.  A standard Sunkist 8 wedge fruit cutter will yield appros 1600 lemon slices per case, or $0.015 cents per wedge.  Even if you save just 50 slices a day, you've only saved 78 cents, and at the expense of pissing off 50 customers.   The server and managers were both very courteous and friendly.",

Mashed potatoes could use some work though, they weren't that great but the biscuit that came with it was delicious, as well. Great selection of yummy cocktails!",

    "text": "We made two stops here during our stay at they Hard Rock. A late night dinner and a quick lunch on departure day. Here is a summary of our choices.  1) House Made Burratta - Pears, Walnuts, Balsamic, Grilled Bread  2) Roasted Salmon with Creamy Barley, Poached Artichokes, Grilled Asparagus, Mushrooms, Preserved Lemon, Chile Vinaigrette.  3) Fried Chicken - Honey Biscuit, Potatoes, Gravy.  4) Chicken Meatballs - Buffalo Sauce, Dolce Gorgonzola, Celery Leaf.  5) Soft Pretzels with Provolone Fondue.  I have listed the items from our most to least favorites. The Burratta was so good we ordered it on both visits. The Salmon and Fried Chicken were Solid entrees, worthy of consideration on future visits.  The Meatballs were hot, that's it, just hot. We did not taste any of the Vinegar or Butter that usually adds balance to a Buffalo Sauce. There wasn't enough Gorgonzola or Celery Leaf to cut the heat either.   The Pretzels did not live up to the hype I've seen on Yelp and other sights. The Pretzels themselves were Doughy and tasted more like Dinner Rolls than Pretzels and an unpleasant skin had formed on the Fondue.   I also had a Cocktail called, Velvet Death which featured Gin, Absinthe, Velvet Falernum and Cointreau. It was appropriately named, smooth, but amazingly strong! One was enough to give me quite a buzz!  Service was fine and they are easily Wheelchair Accessible.  Culinary Dropout had both highs and lows, but the highs mean I'll probably give it another shot the next time we stay at The Hard Rock.",

Ordered the brown bag specials for 2.95 which includes a random beer in a brown paper bag, the first beer was a Rogue Tall boy! The rest of the beers from then on were either PBRs or Schaefer's.  Still no complaints for $2.95.  We also ordered truffle fries and the grilled asparagus, both good snacks but a little surprised the asparagus was served chilled.  Still ate everything and ordered the prime rib dip w/ au jus.  Sandwich was good, but wouldn't mind trying some other things on the menu.  I think I enjoy the atmosphere, beers/ cocktails and appetizers/snacks more than the entrees but will come back if I'm ever attending another concert on property.  *would love to come back and try their brunch!!",

    "text": "We stopped in for happy hour during a staycation at the Hard Rock. At first, I had my doubts, because it looked a little too \"hipserty.\" But my doubts were put to rest by our great waitress and the tasty food and drinks she delivered.  We each had a couple of the $3 mug beers. What a great deal! This wasn't PBR or its ilk; these were actual IPAs and pale ales! And although we split only two small appetizers, they were great values as well -- and one was pretty outstanding. The homemade potato chips and onion dip were a retro take on the classic snack. Fine enough, and well worth the happy hour price ($3). But the smoked salmon bruschetta ($6) was fantastic! Reminded me of the smoked fish dip at Ted Peters in St. Pete's, FL. We could have eaten that all day. It doesn't look like it's on the regular menu, so if you want this little slice of heaven, you'll have to hit happy hour. But why wouldn't you? The regular menu prices seemed a bit high ($22 fried chicken, anyone?), but these really felt like a steal.  We used to go to the Pink Taco for happy hour on a fairly regular basis, but I think I've found a new favorite. I hope to be dropping in on the Dropout soon!",

We were less than spectacular, disheveled and unshaven and treated very well nonetheless. I ordered iced coffee, ahi tartare appetizer and steak salad. Husband got iced tea, and the bistro burger. Everything was fabulously fresh and very uniquely tasty. Nothing ordinary here. The steak was marinated medallions, perfectly seared and seasoned and rare in the middle. Blue Cheese dressing was obviously fresh. Even the iced tea is special (mango passionflower?) Hubby wanted more ice for his tea but that is hardly a complaint. The staff is all young and cute and efficient. I did not like that the staff would run into the side room with the curtains and eat, that was uncool, but it was that time of day. Like I said, we looked like bums complete with luggage and were treated like royalty. Gotta love that.",

The set up is beautiful, the out door seating area is cozy, the lighting is dim but it fits the style of this restaurant.   They have a raw bar which I loved $3 oysters and $3 white shrimps ($3 each) We also order the fried chicken, it comes with mash potatoes, cole slaw, and a biscuit. The fried chicken smelled good, however after cutting into it we noticed it was pink and still bleeding. We did inform the manager, however we were told that is normal. I'm pretty sure you can get sick from eating raw/under cooked chicken.   Our server Billy was ok, sometimes you catch people on a bad day. The manager had good energy and was extremely nice.  I would try this place again, I would just be simple about what I order.",

Felicia our server was most fantastic as she was very accommodating to our 4 year old's endless questions. On the right occasion, Nice place to hit up prior to an evening of Vegas debauchery.",

This comparison almost rang True until I got to my second piece of chicken which was undercooked. I just put it to the side and had it for lunch the next day. I never return food but that's me.

    "text": "Stopped in for brunch on Sunday before heading to the airport. We were able to squeeze into a spot at the bar. This place definitely has a rustic chicness with a slight rebellious energy. I love the chandeliers and the green vintage couches. A drop-down garage door opens up to the outdoor patio and the iconic Hard Rock pool. There's also a 12-seat raw bar and a full antipasti bar if you're feeling the urge.   I went with the wildly popular soft pretzels with provolone fondue.  So delicious! The soft pretzels come with sea salt and are so warm and pillowy. The fondue sauce was wonderful with a nice sharp bite and a creamy irresistible texture. Nothing like dunkin' fresh-baked pretzel bites into a pot of creamy fondue. Real crowd pleaser!   Reconnect with your inner child and go with the Cap'n Crunch French Toast. Dusted with powdered sugar and fresh raspberries and drizzled with a lovely custard sauce. The flavors meld together so well. This French toast has it all!   The menu offers up such a variety with fried chicken, king crab legs, salmon, oysters, grilled cheese sliders, jambalaya, 36-hour pork ribs, pork belly cubano, cheese plates, Korean rib eye cab and monkey bread...just to name a few.  Culinary Dropout is proving to be a heavyweight in the Hard Rock world, joining the likes of Nobu, Pink Taco and 35 Steaks & Martinis. This place is a great hangout spot with screens, libations, fun appetizers and dishes and a prime pool-side locale.   Highly recommend!",

Fortunately, the quick delivery of my chicken stopped me from filling up on pretzels.",

Could have gone without the chicharron tho. My friends ordered the jalapeno drinks and loved them. We also got the nachos for the table w pork belly and it was the best thing on the table. My other friend got the mussels. He enjoyed them. I tried one but it was fishy. However I usually don't like mussels so I'm not the best judge of them. Great ambiance. Overlooking the pool, cornhole and large couches to hangout. They also have live music.  We were there w 2 girls that fiddle and they were sooo good!!  If we didn't have a show to go to we would have stayed. Management if you have their name so I can follow them I would appreciate it.",

The Menu seemed interesting with a good selection of something for everyone. The layout of the restaurant is REALLY nice! I was shocked when we arrived at 8pm on a Sunday night and nearly the entire restaurant was empty. There were no more than 5 occupied tables. Not a good sign, but based on the high Yelp reviews, we assumed it was just a slow night.   We started off with the Soft Pretzels with provolone fondue. When it arrived we immediately had to send it back because the cheese was cold. When it came back it was lukewarm and still didn't have too much flavor. For my main entree I had the Pork Belly Ramen which was also disappointing. The Pork belly wasn't tender at ALL (actually rough and hard to chew) and the broth was bland. My friend ordered the fried chicken and it also wasn't good...and it was cold! Our waiter felt bad about the experience and comped his meal, which was a nice gesture.   The only thing this place has going for itself is strong drinks and a great wait staff. Our servers were super pleasant and accommodating. Not sure if we came on an \"off\" night, but all of our meals were mediocre at best.",

Our server, Ben, was incredible. He was helpful from drinks, to menu, to what to do out on Fremont Street. Lets start with the pretzels and fondue....we started with one order.....and ended with three. INCREDIBLE. You HAVE to try them. I split the Maple Salmon for dinner and a split portion was perfect after enjoying appetizers. The beets on the dish were delish. We ended with the Apple Monkey Bread & the Carmel Popcorn pudding thing. It was AMAZING.  If you find yourself out at The Hardrock you HAVE to eat here. Enjoy it.

Major props to the manager, Joe for making sure we were taken care of the minute we arrived. The place was pretty crowded because it was during the popular \"Breakfast by the poolside\" hour, so no small tables were available. But instead of making us wait, Joe invited us to sit at one of the largest tables in the restaurant, and there were only two of us! Not only that, but he checked on us frequently to see if we needed anything.   Needless to say, the food was tasty, the view by the pool is lovely, and it's just a cool laid back place overall to enjoy breakfast. I'd highly recommended swinging by.",

Just how it is in AZ. The hostess was not at her post & we waited a little bit, once we were seated the waiter was really quick to get our drinks & order our food. Apps came in a snap!

    "text": "Holy shit. My boyfriend and I came here for lunch, and Jesus Christ we'll never come back. We have both bartended and served in the industry for 5 and 6 years, respectively, we tend to go into places with an open mind toward what a place has to offer.  First off, our server was training a new girl, which usually means better service, you're getting a two for one for gods sake! At the very least you get 1 1/2 times the service because one of them is learning. But sweet Jesus we ended up with 1/2 what we would expect from a single server. They disappeared for long periods at a time, we had to specifically ask for napkins after receiving finger foods, and NEVER got silverware, at any point in time. We got our appetizers and watched it get cold as we continued to wait for our FIRST round of cocktails.  Apparently the bartender was training as well, those two menu ready cocktails took over 20 minutes (yes, we looked at the time) in a restaurant that was MAYBE 1/10 capacity, including the indoor, outdoor, AND bar seating.  The drinks were so unbalanced I wanted to smack whomever trained the trainer AND trainee of those bartenders. It's hard to fuck up an old fashioned once you know how to make it, but watered down whiskey with a bourbon cherry on top does NOT an old fashioned make, my friend.  The menu and cocktail list, along with the quirky name, seemed to have the potential to be a great restaurant and cocktail stop. But the service was horrendous. If this restaurant were not riding on the back of the Hard Rock Casino big brother, I would laugh at the blatant foreshadowing of a business ready to close its doors before the idea could blossom into a singularly successful business. Beyond the total disregard for anything mimicking customer and/or industry service, to see new additions being trained to act as such was blasphemous for all proper restaurants and bars in the world.   Shame on you and your mooch business model mentality, that clearly relies on a presence inside of a large, profitable casino, that overrides the necessity for an individual attempt at creating a thriving business with a staff worth regarding.",

When we initially walk inside the location, we were greeted by an young lady, whom was very friendly and cooler than a fan.  She then provided us on options of where would we like to be seated, the bar, a table or sitting down at a table outside facing this awesome jungle style pool. I decided NOT to get my George of the jungle ON and we said by the bar. Being the cool person I am me and the lady posted up by the tvs like we had the remote control . Lol  The menu is pretty basic but offered the right options we needed to satisfy the beast. I order the Fried shrimp Caesar salad, and the breakfast burrito since it was only 11:30 AM. Boy did they both live up to my expectations! The breakfast Bburrito display much flavor and is a good size. You literally can split this with a partner or friend. The breakfast Brito also came with some crispy delicious potatoes. On the side came this delicious salsa to get my toes twinkling. The salad was very fresh and the fried shrimp was very crispy.  I also tried a new IPA call Big Dog that was referred by the cool bartender with the awesome tattoos. Word-of-mouth is that Dig Dog IPA is on the rise.   Our food came out extremely fast and the service promptly took care of us. Thank you for a good experience.    If any readers try Dig Dog IPA or had tried it, please let me know what you think about it.",

Decided to take one of his adderall and forgot that a side effect is not having an appetite and basically feeling all jacked up on Mountain Dew.  That being said, we ordered a few apps and mainly decided to drink our dinner.  For some reason I thought I would drink a few extra dirty Ketel One martinis like the good old days (before turning 30 and being a grandma).  That led to bad decisions like ordering oysters in the desert (they were fresh as flown in that day can be and I did not get sick so I guess that says something).  We also got the soft pretzel bites with fondue, a cute little cheese container of sorts with a heat source underneath.  My bf also got the charcuterie plate.  Dana took care of us and probably thought I was a freak because of my adderall induced nausea and indifference to food.    Definitely a casual spot with quick and tasty food and stiff drinks.  I would go back next time I am at the HRH.",

Their cocktail menu sounds inventive and exciting...now, they just need to add some alcohol to them. When we ordered our cocktails the waitress suggested ordering a double (because retrospectively she knew) for only $4 more. Even with the double we couldn't detect the slightest bit of alcohol. If I ever return to this place I will only order wine or beer, since they won't be able to water that down. I would have given two stars, but like I said the food was good and so was the service.",

    "text": "HRH Las Vegas is my home away from home and gastropubs are my go-to so it makes Culinary Dropout a perfect spot for me. They have a huge outdoor patio facing one of the pools and a nice bar that faces the patio. Great service from the bartenders as well, they know their stuff!  They have a decent craft beer selection, a great cocktail menu and good food. I've only been here a few times but have liked pretty much everything I have tried. They have a great raw bar with just about anything you'd want in the shellfish category. The burgers are good, the small plate menu is nice for light apps and the pretzel fondue is a must-try! (you can get it half off during Happy Hour too). Speaking of happy hour, they have $3 mug beer which includes their craft beer on tap. If you're in Vegas, check it out.",

It took forever for them to come over to get our drink order and it took longer for them to get the drinks to us. The drinks were totally watered down. The food was over priced and there was nothing we had that I can't get anywhere else. After they dropped off our food they never came back. The arugula salad was average, I asked for dressing in the side and it came with dressings. The roasted beets were good, it would take five orders to fill a plate because the order was so tiny. The burger was average. The pretzels were good, nice and warm. I t was my first time here and it'll definitely be my last.",

    "text": "Got a sitter lined up for Saturday night so the hubs and I could have a date night. We had been to a couple Fox Restaurants in Phoenix, and enjoyed them, so we set Culinary Dropout for our destination.   7pm on a Saturday night, we did not have reservations. The place was not packed, but we were told all the tables were reserved and so we had to sit at a large high-top communal table in the bar area. No big deal. The service was prompt and very friendly. We started with the recommended pretzel bites (they were very good and enough for probably 4 people). Draft beers were $2.95, which I thought was pretty awesome for a Friday evening, and liked even more when I saw the selection. Standard domestics, but also Sierra Nevada, Joseph James, and a Prohibition Lager. Good stuff! For dinner I ordered the fried chicken which was really delicious. The outside is crispy, with a little bit of honey, and the meat inside is nice and juicy - juicy not greasy! It's served with cornbread, cole slaw, and mashed potatoes, which were all excellent. I ate about half of it, and was so excited to have the rest for lunch the next day, but I forgot my to go box on the table! Boo I hate when that happens! My husband had the bistro steak, which was good but not great.  I was very happy when I requested a mocktail and the server asked me about my preferences. We sat and hung out for so long that she actually brought me 3 different mocktails throughout the evening. Awesome!  The food is a little overpriced, but not for a place in a casino. Our entire tab was ~$100 with tip (included 3 beers, 3 mocktails, 2 entrees, and an app).  Best of all, Jeremy Cornwell was playing from 7-10 and taking requests! If you haven't seen this guy, he's an awesome one-man-band type of show, where he records each beat and then plays it on loop, recording the next beat over it. We talked to him after his set ended, and he'll be at Culinary Dropout every Saturday night, 7-10, and Blue Martini every Tuesday and Friday.",

The highlights were the artichoke app, turkey pastrami and the sweet corn pasta. The only complaint that I have is that it was tad warm in the dining area. Other than that...I def recommend for a casual dinner that has great food options!",

Orange zest burnt with a wood match to give the flavor something more complex?  What other place does this sh*t without being arrogant or pompous???  The pretzel bites were amazingly awesome.  The mussels were fan-freaking-tastic (and a steal at only $13).  We had these two appetizers and then split a pastrami sandwich.  It was plenty of food and we left happy.

    "text": "Is this becoming a nationwide trend? It's apparently the age of the chain gastropub. And I gotta say, I like it.  Culinary Dropout is part of the Fox Restaurant Concepts conglomerate of restaurants; the original Culinary Dropout is in Fox's homebase of Scottsdale. I can haz franchising rights in Texas?  I'd heard good things about Hard Rock's atmosphere, and while that mostly disappointed, Culinary Dropout was a fine time. We made reservations for 9 people on a Saturday night, which were completely unnecessary. The restaurant was about half-full, though part of the reason is it's huge with a great, casual patio.  We immediately got a free serving of Soft Pretzels & Provolone Fondue--delicious--a result of a duplicate order. Great start. I was mostly drawn to the impressively diverse, if pricey, beer menu. Woe is me; instead of embracing diversity, I ended up sticking to the very delicious Joseph James lager all night. There's some good stuff on there, and if you've lost all your money gambling on the tables there's also a \"paper bag special\" for $3. Our waitress described it as Bud Select or something of that ilk; we stayed away but I found it cheekily fun.  Menu prices are quite reasonable after getting eye-gouged by the Vegas exchange rate. The Meatloaf--my choice, was exceptionally large and quite filling. Ends were more than a little burnt, but I enjoyed the \"meaty\" part and enjoyed the sides. The Shaved Prime Rib Dip got huge raves from our waitress, who was excellent all night, as well as my fellow diners who ordered it. The Fish & Chips and 36-Hour Pork Ribs were called as decidedly average.  It's a really great ambiance, and if the Hard Rock had more of the \"zoo\" atmosphere that I was promised, I think the night would've been even better. As it is, it's a short cab ride from the strip and was still a great time regardless.",

    "text": "Made reservations for 6 pm on Saturday before checking out Zac Brown Band. So glad we had reservations as we were walking in, the hostess was telling a party of three, who did not have reservations, the place was completely booked for the night. Maybe it was due to ZBB performing there that night or maybe that's the usual for a Saturday night. I'm not sure. The hostess was super pleasant and our servers were pretty chill and laid back. Not too obtrusive which is just the way I like it.  The restaurant's decor is fabulous. English Pub meets Vintage Hollywood. Perfect for the Hard Rock. Hip and cool and definitely caters to a younger crowd (or the young at heart). We were seated by the window, which ended up being a quieter table (relatively speaking, of course. The place is loud and unapologetic about it. It is the Hard Rock, after all. Quiet and romantic this place is not.).   The BF ordered the grilled cheese sliders with fries. I didn't care for either. The bread on the grilled cheese was way too thick, too hard, and dry. Not enough butter, in my opinion. I like my grilled cheese more on the greasy side. The cheese tasted slightly grainy. Maybe the provolone fondue set the bar too high for me that night. The bacon was sparse and a little overdone. The fries were okay. Nothing special about em. The dish looked good but I didn't think it tasted as good as it looked.  I ordered the highly recommended pretzels and provolone fondue based on yelp recommendations. Truth be told, that dish is why I wanted to go to Culinary Dropout. And a little more truth...before I give my opinion on the dish, I need to say I've been going low carb for a while so when I indulge, it needs to be good or I will be a big, terrible, cranky, mean monster. It's True. This was my night to cheat and I was going to do it BIG.  So, was it worth it? Oh. Yeah.   Did I stuff myself silly?  Yes. Yes, I did. I did share one or two pieces but I wasn't happy about it.   The pretzels nuggets looked perfect and smelled so good! Deep brown in color and perfectly textured. Crunchy exterior yielding to warm, chewy, and airy interior. Honestly, I could have skipped the fondue entirely. But, I didn't. This was my cheat night, after all! The cheese was excellent. It was a simple meal. But it was a good meal. And I'm still thinking about it...",

    "text": "Great visit. We sat outside during our visit and got to enjoy the live show!  Two things I came to Yelp about. First is the Soft Pretzels & Provolone. DUDE! Completely worth it! They were even good reheated. True story! Second I must rave about the service that Felicia provided. What an experience! She is what I hope for everytime I visit a restaurant. Great service, great personality and completely knowledgable of the menu and made great suggestions.  I can guarantee my return for the pretzels and I will definitely request Ms. Felicia! Me and my lady were completely impressed with everything.  If you're thinking about going, I hope that this review will convince you that it is totally worth a shot.",

    "text": "I dig the place. The happy hour is pretty decent. It helps that location is centralized and off the strip. There is an outdoor area for dining. I have been here for brunch and I actually prefer brunch here over dinner/ happy hours. But I have to say that those pretzel bites are AMAZING!   Was not a fan of the service (unless you are at the bar). I just felt that alot of the staff had that \"i'm here to get tips, and do the minimum work... while getting paid\".   Brunch is what saves this review from getting just two stars. I feel the brunch staff is far more attentive and knows the menu more, while giving their own personal suggestions. LOVE THAT FRENCH TOAST!",

    "text": "Culinary Dropout is another gastropub that has infiltrated Las Vegas. British and Irish food tends to be heavy and tend to pair well with beers. Dare I say that CD does not match any preconceived connotations, but instead take it to a new level.   I had ordered the Fish 'n Chips ($19) and it was worth the casino price. With two other English Pubs nearby, I prefer this version. The cod has a lighter batter which is spiked with heat. Although the setting is dark, the crispy exterior looked to be tinted in red. A taste of Tabasco laces the shell and lends an enjoyable characteristic profile. The side of coleslaw was also unique with a hint of citrus. I finished that first.   As for desserts, it should not be passed upon. The peanut butter chocolate pie is better than the traditional banoffee pie. This declaration is not meant to undermine the deliciousness of the latter. I could devour a whole pie of either, but the chocolate version will always be first choice.   The casual nature of the establishment makes me like it more. The dark tones and rich decor had me lounging in the banquette. I am also rather jealous of the staff. They are able to dress in their own attire. Although a neat concept, it makes distinguishing them rather difficult.",
