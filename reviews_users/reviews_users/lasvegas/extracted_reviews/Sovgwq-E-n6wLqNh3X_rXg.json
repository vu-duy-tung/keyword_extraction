    "text": "Went here on a recommendation from a friend. Read the reviews and thought, wow this place must really be good!  I thought the staff was great. The 2 stars are based on the food.  Rarely do I use the salt and pepper shakers. The rice was so bland I had to. How do you mess up rice? The chips came with a bean dip and red salsa. That was kind of different since most Mexican restaurants only offer a red salsa. I ordered the chili relleno. Pretty basic, nothing special. My kids had the enchiladas. And my wife ordered taquitos. They didn't finish their dishes and when we took it to go we ended up throwing it in the trash.   I have a feeling the great reviews are coming from tourists that haven't had awesome Mexican food. Maybe the same people that think even Taco Bell is real Mexican food. Haha  Anyways, I gave the place a try and will never go back.   If you still want to give the place a try. Order 1 thing, before making a big order.",

I added salt but that didn't seem to improve the flavor. The salsa was boring it had no spice. But it was complimentary so I really shouldn't complain too much. To drink I ordered a Tecate preparada, which is beer with lime, salt, clam juice and hot sauce. You can pick your beer by the way, I just felt like Tecate was a good option and it was. That drink was so good and refreshing on a hot summer day. They also have margs and a few other speciality cocktails if beer doesn't tickle your fancy.  I didn't want to eat something super heavy, so I just chose a steak quesadilla. It came out in less than 5 minutes so props to the kitchen for the speedy service. It was good but nothing memorable, it was just a quesadilla. It came with a very small amount of sour cream and guacamole on the side, like a squirt of each which was disappointing. Anyway I was in and out within a half hour, and paid less than $20. Not great, not bad, just OK.",

They give the unusual chips and salsa when you sit but they also give retried beans as well. My toddler loves to dive into those as soon as we sit. Speaking of, they also immediately bring out a bowl of Fidel soup for the kiddos too. Don't worry, you get yours before your meal, after you order. The drinks are strong, the food is delicious, and you will have leftovers for the breakfast munchies you will have from all those margaritas. We take anyone who comes to town there and we have always been thanked numerous times afterwards. Go there. Now!",

Walking in we were greeted by every employee along the way and felt so welcome it immediately or a star! We started with the guacamole made fresh, table side and it was very good! They also serve you fresh salsa and a bean dip with chips complimentary. They also start you off with a traditional Mexican soup ( just like grandmas house in Mexico  is what I was told) that I have never experienced before but fell in love right away! I even pinned a recipe right at the table because I wanted to know how to make it. It was a lighter tomato soup with very thin noodles that I could picture myself eating with grilled cheese..yum! So back to this delicious meal... I ordered the chicken chimichanga and it was absolutely huge! Had I known I would have shared it but hey more for me! For dessert we tried the fried ice cream that had a pleasant surprise of caramel on top instead of the traditional chocolate sauce on the east coast. All of the employees were very helpful making sure drinks were filled and plates were cleared timely and most important were very grateful we decided to dine with them. I would definitely go back here and would also recommend it to anyone looking for some good Mexican!",

And no there were not a lot of people waiting at the restaurant, most tables were empty. My mom was still eating her food when one of the hosts casually walked by and picked up her plate and walked off. She wasn't done eating nor did he ask her, he just picked it up, started speed walking and tried being smooth about it, which is extremely rude and not at all good customer service.

The food is delicious with big portions and comes out very fast but the thing that impresses us the most is the customer service.   The staff is probably the most attentive and friendly staff out of any restaurant I have ever been too.   Even when handling a take out order they are friendly, never rush you and patiently go through everything in your take out bag before giving it to you and walking you out the door.   We have to try to not go to this place cause it's always our first choice.",

Needless to say that we have been missing out!   Great parking setup despite the location (tight commercial area near DI and Eastern) and wonderful and authentic atmosphere inside. Traditional attire, non-obtrusive and traditional music over the speaker and a live Mariachi band that stopped through to provide an awesome performance.   The service was awesome and it really felt like we had two waiters since we kept getting effective follow-up from the staff. The entire experience felt like the popular El Cholo restaurants in Los Angeles...but with better pricing, selections and food portions. Speaking of selections I was shocked to see almost 10 or more entree selections for EVERY meat group (seafood, fish chicken, beef and pork). I chose the Fajitas de Res.....BUT had to get a to-go box immediately since I got full from the unlimited chips and salsa and multiple Cadillac Margaritas lol  Overall, this is our definite go-to authentic Mexican food restaurant from now on.",

No cheese or fresh tomatoes either. The others in our party asked for their fajitas well done, and they weren't. The guacamole was excellent, refried beans and salsa was also yummy.

They have reasonably priced lunch specials and they are slightly overstaffed which helps to get you in and out pretty fast if you need to get on with your day.   I've had my share of experiences with Lindo...look at my previous reviews, it's a love - hate thing. They've messed up my orders. They can't seem to refill the salsa and sometimes the chips. And no not everyone wants fried fish tacos. But sometimes none of that crap matters. You go in and don't have to wait forever to be seated. And you'll don't pay out the nose for what you get. Sometimes...that's all you need.   Back up to 3 stars...and removed from a special list.",

It kind of got to be a game, each person would ask where they were on the list and all the girl would say is 'yah, just a few' or 'just a little bit' without even finding their names. Not a place that is used to packed crowds.  Now lets talk about the veggie burrito I got which was just filled with zucchini, 3 small pieces of onion and two slivers of carrots. No, doesn't pass for anything.   No beans or cheese, or anything fun like that in it. Oh well, lesson learned. You guys can keep this one for yourself. Wont be going back.",

I am not a big fan of their margaritas, they taste a little like cheap tequila to me but I have gone with 3 other people who love them so it must be I am used to sugary low on tequila margaritas. We are always too full for desert but I plan on trying it sometime.  I will admit there are a few things there I do not like. Their salsa is too spicy for me and my boyfriend but we are wusses. I ordered chicken tacos a la carte before and they weren't any good, hardly any flavor. I ordered something when I was drunk which I thought was going to be like Pollo a La Crema but it was not and it tasted slimey and almost made me puke, but it was an authentic Mexican dish and I was a drunk white girl.  It is all in what you order. Great service, very friendly, and fast. This is the only Mexican restaurant I will go to.",

As for the food, I asked the waiter if they had enchiladas swissas (enchiladas with a green salsa and sour cream sauce) since it wasn't on their menu and he made it happen. I finished half of my meal, the portions were LARGE. I got two enchiladas and they were huge.   The one minor thing they get dinged on are their \"aguas frescas\", natural flavored waters. They were not authentic Mexican, more like the powdered versions, but regardless the refills were free. Many Mexican places don't give refills on these drinks.  Bottom line: If you're in the mood for good, casual sit down Mexican food, this is the place to go. Away from the crowds, great service and tasty food.",

Places usually are not as good as you remember, this is the exception. Guacamole was better than we we get at home and the Steak Ranchero had better flavor than I remembered. They cook the steaks a little on the rear side, so watch for that when ordering.",

    "text": "I would have originally given this place like three stars, maybe.  More on that in a moment.  I usually get chili rellenos or a burrito or fajitas or something, but tonight I decided to try the pollo con rejos y crema.  It was pretty good, although I would have liked more lettuce in my \"salad\".  The chicken was pounded thin, the sauce had a lot of flavor...well not really.  It was just green and watery all over my plate.  I didn't get nearly as many strips of pasilla as I thought I would, but I got a heck of a lot of onion...  We usually get there after six, so it's already obnoxiously noisy, crowded, hot, etc etc.  Today we showed up around 5:30 and got a small break before the crowds poured in (why!?) and raised the decibel level of the place by 10000.  But I could even deal with that.  My glass stayed full, and our server was friendly and accommodating in spite of our picky (aka personalized) orders.  It was when the check came and the debit card left my hand that the real fiasco began.  Our server returned to our table, politely and quietly explaining that my card had been declined because the bank was refusing to approve the transaction.  Well duh.  Wait a minute.  WHAT!?  After 20 minutes of struggling on the phone both inside and outside (it's so LOUD) with automated lists and air headed operators, the issue was finally resolved.  No, my account was fine.  No, there had been no lock put on it due to unaccounted for activity.  Yes, the server incorrectly punched in my expiration date.  Seriously?  I know five and six are right beside each other, but SERIOUSLY?  I was steamed and so upset that the mediocre meal I'd just semi-enjoyed became a churning, angry mass in my stomach.  Thanks Lindo for frustration induced indigestion.  And I think their tortilla chips suck!",

    "text": "This place is the absolute best! My husband and I had a destination wedding at the Mirage on a Thursday and we were looking for a location to have a lunch for our guest of about 70 people the next day. We didn't have a huge budget so having something on the strip was out of the question.  We asked a sever at another restaurant where the best Mexican food in Vegas was and he suggested this place. We couldn't agree with him more. Stephanie who we worked with for about a year delivered on everything we talked about over the phone. She was absolutely amazing! We had our spin to a traditional wedding reception on a Friday from 2-5pm during the lunch period and our guest selected 1 of 4  lunch items that we pre-selected that came with rice, beans, salad or soup, and a soft drink.  Stephanie was nice enough to create the specialized menu with our names on it. It was also happy hour so the drinks were half off. The food during the lunch period is very affordable.  When we arrived at the restaurant they reserved the entire back area for us. The customer service was absolutely out of this world. They had several servers helping us. They also sang a happy wedding song to us, put sombrero's on our head, gave us a shot of tequila and had us eat churro. It was the cutest thing.   If you are having a destination wedding in Vegas and not looking to do the traditional reception thing I would highly suggest having your guest meet at the Lindo during lunch for a great time.   Important tad bit of information: 1. They have a free shuttle service that will take you back to the strip. If you decide to take the city bus it will let you out right in front of the restaurant.",

The reviews of Lindo were good (especially the recent ones) so I suggested it and the whole family drove over.  From the moment we sat down our group (6 people) we were totally taken care of.  The service was amazingly fast, (food too) the menu was like 6 huge pages of great dishes.  Everyone in the party got something different and everyone was raving after we walked out.  The manager stopped by once or twice to check on us as well as numerous staff.  I can't thank my fellow Yelpers enough; this has to have been the best YELP find ever - however I have found a lot of really good places.  If you are in Vegas for any reason you owe it to yourself to try this place, I was 100% satisfied and I bet you will be as well.",

The dressing was light and the greens were not drowning in it. The restaurant was clean, employees were very friendly and nice. The only thing about this restaurant that I found odd was that it was sooo dark. You might want to bring a flashlight to read the menu. My dad ordered the chimichanga, my mom ordered one of the combinations and my boyfriend ordered the orange roughy.  They used quality ingredients and everyone liked what they ordered. There's lots of parking in the back. It doesnt really matter to me whether they serve authentic Mexican food or not.  The food is good, place is clean, they use quality ingredients, fast and friendly service... Definitely would go back.",

Everything looked good on the buffet table but the did not have chorizo con huevos and my brother had green chillaqueles, both dishes were good. In fact everthing looked good on the menu. I would probbly go back if I ever had the chance.   So why not more stars? Mom, who had a cup of muendo did not have any posole in the bowl. We were so surprised thinking maybe this is the unique prepration advertised in the menu. As it turns out it was just bad luck because the bus boy, who was much friendlier than the waiter assured us that the meundo on the buffet table had hommonie in it. The other reason it did not get more stars was because we asked ourselves what we considered a 5 star Mexican restaurant and we agreed it was Casa Garcias in Anaheim, CA. This was based on the food alone because the atmosphere is much nicer here. In all it was a good visit but we tend to be a lot harder in our evaluation of Mexican.   On a side note, it was interesting to note that the owner was named Timoteo Barajas, which is the same as mine.",

We were provided with complimentary chips, salsa, and beans. All were amazing. We ordered the table side guacamole which was good, but not amazing. It lacked some flavor but the presentation was awesome.   We were also served complimentary \"Fidel Soup\" which was almost like a flavorful tomato soup with noodles and it was delicious!   My main dish was the chimichanga with melted cheese on top. The thing was HUGE and I could barely eat half. I was also saving room for fried ice cream! I would certainly recommend getting that as a sweet treat to end the meal.   This place is a must if you're feeling adventurous and want to travel off the strip in Vegas.

    "text": "It is a popular place, but plan on waiting outside as there is barely room for waiting guests inside. The hostess was taking a phone order when we arrived- she was very detailed and patient with the caller, which is nice but caused a backup of people wanting a table. Once seated however, the waiter was friendly, attentive, and really knew the menu. The food is standard Mexican, with fresh ingredients and good sized portions. I had a skinny margarita, and enjoyed it. The seating is a bit cozy and was full of families so it was noisy, but overall a good experience.",

    "text": "Fifteen years ago when we first moved to the Las Vegas area we were told (incorrectly) that Macayo's was the best Mexican food in Las Vegas.  Their food was good until we tasted Lindo Michoacan's food - their food is not good it is great.  We have never returned to eat Macayo's canned Mexican food.    Being an adventurous eater I judge Mexican food establishment by two simple rules.  Do they offer on their menu proteins like lengua?  If you don't offer at least lengua then you are not a True Mexican eatery.  Lindo offers lengua.  Do you offer a salsa for the more spicier inclined?  Lindo offers a spicer house salsa - just ask the server when they bring you the regular salsa and chips.  Two for two.    The food at Lindo's tastes fresh and their menu is loaded with several choices to fit any palate.  Servers are attentive, knowledgeable of their menu, and quickly whisk away to quickly fulfill your orders.    As for the negatives - none of them are about the food - that's rare.  The Original Lindo's is small and yet packs in the booths and tables as close as humanly possible.  This can make it hard to navigate around for those traveling to use the restroom or in our case those that are handicap and use a walker/wheelchair.  Packing everyone in also means that this place is loud.  At times it can be hard to carry a conversation with your friends/family.  Even worse sometimes on the weekend they employ a DJ to blast out music which makes conversing even harder.  Outside the parking lot can get packed with cars as the restaurant doesn't have enough spaces it should for its popularity.  Be prepared for some patience to find a parking spot and waiting for a booth or a table.    Last negative - and it is an interesting one to note.  This location allows individual/groups to \"buy-out\" the restaurant.  It was disheartening to make plans to catch up with friends I hadn't seen in 3+ years only to be turned away because the restaurant had been bought out for the night.  We got off easy as we quickly researched another restaurant on our phones and then set off in our cars but we saw others who had taken taxis to eat dinner only to turned away.  For our inconvenience we were handed a \"coupon\" for a free margarita on our next visit - yet the \"coupon\" made no mention of it and looked like a standard flyer.  Personally, I think they should have given a recommendation for another good Mexican restaurant in the area (especially for the poor people who took/paid for the taxi).    But this is a restaurant and although hospitality and accessibility are indeed very important pieces it comes down to the food.  In the 10+ times I've been here I've never had a food related complaint.  However, now I may just have to call ahead to make sure they are not \"bought out\" for the night.",

We get our our ordered quickly but we sit until 2:50pm before the porter notices that we haven't been asked to order. He does he waiters job to take our order. We left. We didn't order anything. It's unacceptable to wait 30 minutes to have an order taken.   They were not busy at all. When we told the porter we wanted to leave the waiter came by asking us what we wanted. Joel the waiter started to argue with my husband telling him, \"come on man. I was busy.\" We wouldn't have been so upset if he didn't come around to check on all the other tables 15 minutes earlier and never acknowledging us. He wasn't busy. I will wait if a waiter doesn't come around to check on anyone.   The best Mexican food I never got to try at all. I won't be back.   I can't expect good food from service like this on a slow day. Plus the menu is to big to have good food.",

    "text": "19/100 Yelp 100 2016.  Went to Lindo Michoacan last night after realizing that many local restaurants were closed early. My best friend had talked about this restaurant before when I visited her in Vegas and had always sung its praises!   The heavy front door lends to its authenticity of decor. Inside its walls and ceiling are plastered with tastefully placed artwork, beautiful mosaic sconces and hanging lamps that popped with color and added so much charm to this place! We were quickly greeted by our server and drinks were rapidly on their way! My friend got a strawberry daiquiri and I got a coconut margarita (always rocks!). Super delicious and STRONG! Yum!   Chips and salsa are served with bean dip that is so packed with flavor! The salsa reminded me of a chili red sauce, almost what they would drizzle over an enchilada or wet burrito. It doesn't have the small chunks of tomato or onion that you might expect. Could have had some more heat, but still delicious!   I ordered the Morelia (#1 combo plate): chicken enchilada, carne asada taco (crispy shell) and chile relleno... These come with refried beans topped with cheese and Spanish rice.   The chile relleno was my favorite! Large poblano chile stuffed with melty cheese and basted in that familiar egg white \"merengue\" mixture and dipped in... Hey! I think it's the red sauce! Damn that sauce is good! The rice was a bit on the salty side so I only took a few bites, but everything else was drool worthy amazing!   My bestie and I capped off our gastronomical Mexican experience with their homemade flan. Each bite was creamy, caramel-ey and \"sweet-film-on-the-roof-of-your-mouth\" amazing. With drinks, entrees and dessert, we spent about $30 each.   I'll be coming back here with bestie EVERY time I visit her. Highly recommend!",

The chicken quesadillas were dry and cheese was cold. My chicken enchiladas tasted like the sauce was burnt and the chicken was dry as well. Last but not least i was excited about my carnitas plate but it had NO FLAVOR and the meat was tough.  My rice was hard like it was left out. I was very dissatisfied. The location is big and had a beautiful view. Customer severice was ok when i said the food wasnt great they pretty much ignored my comment. I wont be going back. Spent 80 dollars on something i could've made at home. The food looked delicious but tasted terrible.",

I love how when you order guacamole they make is fresh. So fresh that they make it right in front of you. And let me tell you, one of the best guacamoles I have ever tasted. When they make it, they make plenty. I had to actually take it to go. And the day after guac taste just as good!  They also always bring out a cup of their soup. Very simple but very tasteful.   When going to a mexican restaurant you always have to order a Margarita! I got a Mango Margarita. It was so good. They put lucas on the ring of the cup. Bomb.  Service was good. Nothing to complain about. Great place to get my mexican fix.",

Last time we came was Cinco De mayo and they always give out free stuff and the mariachi band is playing live music but no matter what time of the year it's always a good time at Lindo.   This last visit  we came we were seated immediately and our server was prompt on taking our order and greeting us. Complimentary beans and salsa came out right away but be careful not to eat a lot of them because you will get full fast. My boyfriend loves micheladas so he ordered one of those I'm not a beer drinker and don't drink a lot so I had a coke. Straight from the bottle like in Mexico. I swear that is the only way to drink coke it just does something that a can doesn't do.   We decided to order from the lunch menu to save a few bucks and I didn't know that it came with a free soft drink otherwise I wouldn't have ordered the coke. Call me frugal but hey I might be ;). My boyfriend who loves anything pork ordered carnitas which was juicy and tender. I had enchiladas one beef and one chicken. Super good. Both come with rice and beans and I couldn't even finish both enchiladas because I was already full after having chips and beans. The carnitas also came with fresh guac and fresh tortillas. Man those were yummy. Lunch specials do not come with sopa de fideo so we also ordered some of that prior to eating our entrees.   Plenty of busboys and staff checking on us  throughout our meal despite being Busy on Fourth of July , people must have been craving Mexican food. I'm always craving Mexican food and I never get tired of it and Lindo never let's me down.",

A friend recommended coming to the original Lindo Michoacan here on Desert Inn. My daughter and I came this evening and were not disappointed!  Great service, very personable staff and food was sensational. We had cocktails and their famous beans to dip chips into. We ordered the shrimp tacos and they were the best!!  We were so full we couldn't eat desert. We both said we're coming here from now on. Just when we were finishing, live music came on. Very nice!!  I found home!!",

Lots of fresh veggies in the rice. My husband ordered steak--the waiter had the chef grill a second steak because the first was overcooked. I loved the shredded beef taco.   Their lunch specials last until 5:00 (for vegas partiers who wake up late) and are half the price of dinners.   The restaurant is nicely decorated with authentic colorful pottery, glass sconces, pots, fountains, comfortable booths and solid wood tables and chairs. The servers wear traditional clothes and were all friendly.   Free lollipops for dessert!",

The entrees are very good but not great, that is what keeps my review at 4 stars and not 5. I had the Carne Asada and I could say I had better. Like I said very good, not great.

    "text": "It was a warm and dry 9pm Tuesday. My cohort and myself needed sustenance. He was expecting fast food fare, I was desiring carnitas. I told him, head forth towards home, we're going to Lindo. To his surprise regardless of the fact he has lived down the street from here since, oh say, the late 90s my poor friend has failed to enjoy in the delicacies of Lindo's fine Mexican fare. We're greeted promptly as we enter, the staff's garb clean cheerful, somewhat traditional with clearly written name tags of Victor, Carla, Jose, and so much more. The smell of the spot is enticing, the decor borderline cheesy yet, for some reason it is not cheesy at all. Not unauthentic like Macayos, it is actually just right. The manager you can see pacing around making sure everything is running fine. The servers touching base on tables making sure the customers including the viciously drunk lady across from our table swimming in her margarita while her date just nods hoping she doesn't order an item from each section of the menu. Let me put it this way., the atmosphere is great. Casual yet not too informal. I can take a date here and she would be happy. The place works period.   Food, oh the food. The delicious tasty food. Forget what my buddy chap had, it's not his review. I can say this, the man was shocked he had not enjoyed Lindo before. His food, his beer, his shot of 1942, his astonishment of the quality that went into everything. Hell we even had some tomatillo soup and this man did not bitch one bit. He's a beer snob, a steak snoot, a foodie of self hallucinating proportions when he's hopped up on port.   I had the Carnitas in Coca-Cola sauce. Delicious, if only Chinese food could do sauces like this without the MSG. Seriously, tender succulent piece of pork in this delightful sauce gave me the sweet and the meaty in one plate. Fresh guac on the side, beans that were beany, rice that was ricy. I had no complaints save for the fact I couldn't finish it. Granted we had two bowls of chips and two refills of salsa, but I digress.   Food is on point, service is on point, the scene was set, and my stomach was satisfied. Would I recommend this to my friends family and even strangers? You bet your ass I will.   Hell I even skipped some details so my fingers don't go numb.",

My wife had the Carne Asada tacos and I had the Fillet Relleno. Spectacular.  You just can't get food like this in Toronto.  The service was top rate as well. Everyone was attentive, friendly, and gracious.   If you have the time and don't mind moving off the strip you will not be disappointed.",

This restaurant has won the best of Las Vegas award for best Mexican restaurant in town numerous years (it's advertised proudly on their entrance).  Sweet, looks like a winner.  Friendly servers, large restaurant, lots of employees so you're never without.  (I think there was a separate beverage guy and chips/salsa guy).  They start you off with a soup of some sort.  Good but rather simple.  Chips were good, salsa not hot, bean dip meh.  Wife had the standby chimichanga, and she was pleased.  Carnitas were good.  My kid's beef taco was nothing more than a shell and beef (not ground).  No lettuce, cheese, nothing.  My kid was okay with that though, but I thought it was strange.  My other daughter's chicken burrito was just as dry and boring as well.  Prices were a little steep, but it was pretty busy (no wait though), and based on the awards they got I would charge more too.  It's a safe bet for Mexican sit-down (nice booths, friendly staff, even a singer), especially for non-Spanish speakers and families.  If you're willing to gamble, there surely must be better hole-in-the-wall types of places around.",

The place is not cheap but the portions are huge. The agua de Jamaica was delicious! The bus boys/waiters are on it! As soon as my cup was half full they immediately came to refill it, and when i say immediately i mean it... They are so attentive and i never had to ask for anything since they offered way before i even thought about it.

From the strip, it was about a 15 minute drive, but sooooo worth it!!!  Well, to start off with, they bring out yummy chips, salsa, and beans. We ordered aguas de Jamaica and it was delish! Our glasses were constantly refilled, and we felt attended to.   I couldn't decide on the plethora of choices, but finally decided on the fish tacos, which were fabulous. Nice homeade corn tortillas and a generous portion of crunchy fish pieces, and thick slices of avocado.They came with a delicious sauce on the side, and also the lettuce came on the side of the plate, so it was nice to add however much I wanted of each.  My buddy was also indecisive, but by suggestion of the waiter ordered the Pollo Sarandeado, and she absolutely loved the flavoring. She had previously lived in Mexico and missed the authentic food, but this food really did it for her. She also commented it was probably the best chicken she ever had!  To finish off the meal, we had sopapillas. Deeeelicious!",

I understand Cinco De Mayo is like a national holiday for drinking and eating lard filled Mexican food but holy frijoles this place was ridiculous.  As far as I know one of our fearless leaders called and made prior arrangements for seating for our group. Well, by the looks of it, they reserved the waiting area for us and forgot that we wanted to eat.    My night started off crappy after standing at the bar trying to get the attention of the ladies working the bar for about 20 minutes before leaving the bar empty handed and frustrated. We then finally got seated and the waiter asked us what we wanted to drink... We ordered  Margaritas in hope we would be put into a Tequila Coma and that was not the case.. It was like pounding a bottle of Margarita mix hold the tequila.   Next Misti Y.  was awesome enough to hook the table up with the table side guac, and I happened to be sitting with a group of other \"Hot and Spicy\" fans so we asked for our bowl to be HOT.... I think they took the lead of the person making the margaritas and kept out the main ingredient. Jalapeno.   So by this point it was damn near Seis De Mayo and they took our order. We all put our orders in at the same time and i will say that all the food came out quickly... Well almost all the food... Matt C. was sitting to my right with nothing on the table in front of him. we all tried to get the attention of the waiters and when they finally listened to us, we said,\" he did not get his food\" the waiter said okay let me go get it. About 10 minutes later we had to stop him again and this time he had to ask Matt what he had ordered and basically started this process all over again.. Horrible!!!!  Yes, I did open the door for them to earn another star back from us in which they did, but I am glad Matthew C. did not end up with a chipped tooth or something worse.   I will not be back to this location... Esto era horrible y nunca voy a estar de vuelta",

However, this review is specifically for the catering service which the manager was very attentive to our vegetarian requests. We all know that most beans are cooked with lard which is made out of meat or pork fat etc..and the rice is made out of meat or chicken broth.  Nevertheless, Lindo was kind enough to cook vegetarian beans and rice in addition to our regular non vegetarian order. They also made avocado tacos which was so delicious!!

The hand-made tortillas really make a difference and the wait staff continually ensures your complimentary chips, salsa and bean dip are always full!. Had the Chipolte chicken and it was tender, spicy and smoky. Our son ordered the lemon chicken, something I probably would not have ordered.... that is until I tasted it! Fantastic! The guacamole they make table side can be customized to your preferences and they even put jalapenos on the side for us who like it spicier. Very accommodating. Live music in the bar at the one on Eastern, and the waiters do a  mean happy birthday at both locations accompanied by guitar!!",

The chips and salsa are also super good, they give a bean dip along with the salsa which is equally delish!   The only things that  I would complain about are the margaritas and our server. Starting with the server, he was really short with us and very unfriendly. The other staff members were so friendly though, so it wasn't such a problem as it could have been. The margaritas were terrible, they tasted like a glass of sweet and sour, literally the tequila was unnoticeable. With that said, I can handle dinner without a margarita and an unfriendly waiter as long as the food always tastes this yummy!",

For those who like spicy food this is a must try.   We tried the Buey de cilantro, aguachile, chilaquiles, queso fundido, taco dorados, torta and table side  guacamole and hand made tortillas. Everything was delicious and service was great.    Es un buen lugar para celebrar un cumpleanos ya que te cantan y te dan tu tequilazo cumpleanero.     Definitivamente recomendamos este restaurante y sera unos de nuestros lugares favoritos en las Vegas.",

I ordered the pollo con tomate estillo \"zirahuen\" which turned out to be thinly sliced chicken breast covered in an onion, tomato-cream sauce. So delicious. The carne asada was also popular with our group- a large, albeit thin, steak that everyone agreed was cooked perfectly, even the picky medium-rare steak eater was delighted. We were made to feel welcome from before we even entered the establishment when we were greeted and assured that they were happy to serve our large group and remained attentive throughout our meal. Been to Vegas 3 times and have paid as much as $400 for a meal for two- but this was the best meal I have ever enjoyed in Vegas. Delicious.",

The food was good too, but I guess I just was disappointed from all the Yelp hype. Thought it would be better.",

I was constantly always being taken care of whether it be taking away plates, refilling the chip bowl, refill drinks, and making sure everything is okay. They also had all smiles on their faces as it was a pleasure to take care of their customers. On top of that, I came during dinner which was extremely busy. But I was seated right away and taken care of  Once my order was placed, it wasn't even 10 minutes until I got my order. I was surprised with how fast I received my fresh order. Even though it was fast, the food was great!!  Overall, I would definitely recommend this place for one of your local Mexican spots. The environment is festive with all the decorations, everyone is happy, and the workers are  constantly helping you. There's also a live mariachi band that comes around the tables and perform.  Ps. You are served with chips, salsa, and bean dip in the beginning. And pretty much all plates come with rice, beans, and soup unless you get something off the al a carte.  Enjoy! You've gotta check this place out",

He almost hurt himself because he couldn't stop eating it. I ordered the chicken enchiladas they were so good, so many flavors exploding in your mouth. Normally enchiladas are dry but not these, they were moist and very saucy.   After my husband and I were Thanksgiving stuffed they had a complimentary shuttle to take us back to our hotel. If you are ever in Vegas you must try out the Original Lindo Michoacan on Desert Inn Rd you will never see Mexican food the same way because you will always be in search of their spices.",

    "text": "5 stars for an outstanding Mexican authentic restaurant.  After spending lots of time (and money) on The Strip during our most recent trip to Vegas, my wife and I were looking to find something a little more authentic and local. After getting a tip from tour guide about a place called Lindo Michoacan that was \"a little out of the way,\" we decided to look it up on Yelp. After reading a few reviews with words like \"favorite Mexican\" and \"best in Vegas,\" we knew we had found the right place and headed over.  Lindo Michoacan, which is located on Desert Inn Road between 515 and Eastern Avenue, is a large stand alone venue with a large horse statute standing outside to greet you in. We went inside and found a packed venue that can be best described as being a mixture of a hole in the wall and a large beautiful Mexican restaurant. I know those sound like polar opposites, but this venue pulls it off well.  We were seated at our table and our server came over to bring us menus and say hello. He was very friendly, gave us great recommendations and, despite being very busy, was great about checking up on us throughout the meal. While other service we received in Vegas may have been technically better, his passion, hustle and friendliness made for some of the best service we received in Vegas.  After looking over the venue's massive menu, we put in an order for a couple margaritas (I got one that our server described as the \"Cadillac of margaritas\") to start. Our margaritas came out relatively quickly and were both tasty and strong, something both me and my wife greatly appreciated.   As we were working on our margaritas, one of the servers brought out some chips and dip. The chips were some of the best chips I've had at a Mexican restaurant in a while, and the dark green bean dip was outstanding. The server also brought out the Queso Fundido (with lobster meat) that we ordered due to our waiter's strong recommendation. The appetizer was absolutely fantastic and served as another excellent dipping option for our chips...to the point we were getting full before our entrees had even made it out!  Fortunately, the waiter waited a little while before bringing out our main dishes. Once they came out, the sight and smell of them renewed our appetites. I ordered the Carnitas a la Coca Cola (once again based on the waiter's recommendation). It came with refried beans, a guac salad and veggies in place of the rice. The carnitas were absolutely delicious in that they were sweet, tender, juicy and just overall excellent. The veggies were also great and the guac salad made for another dipping option for our chips. My wife loved her food as well, and the only bad part was our stomachs were running out of room. Fortunately, we were able to box up our food, get the check (all for less than $70! what a steal compared to the rest of Vegas) and head out to catch our flight.   Overall, Lindo Michoacan is a fantastic authentic Mexican restaurant. The fun atmosphere, excellent service and top notch food make this one of Vegas' must-try restaurants.",

I will say the staff was incredibly friendly with each person we encountered from reception to servers. That was nice. I have to admit I am not very experienced with Mexican food so I went with something simple. I had a taco enchilada and burrito. They were good but not wow. The guacamole our server made by hand was really good. I'm a craft beer guy and was pretty disappointed there were no choices. In their defense the menu was 10 pages and my table mates ordered some carried meals and they looked good. I just don't have that kind of experience and possibly I missed the mark. Price was very fair for the amount of food. For me this was ok but I will try other locations when visiting next time.",

We were seated at 3:55pm. We waited outside in the shade (100 degrees) for about 30 mins. The rest was in the interior waiting area. There were a few large parties but there was no follow up during our wait to assure us of the status of our table (this could be improved). I wish I could have known of the long wait time when I called or when we arrived. When we were finally seated the restaurant was an approx 50%-60% capacity. We ordered our food at 4:06pm and we were given their typical pre-meal Fideo Soup (delicious). Our food arrived at 4:34pm, I ordered the Lengua Tacos (beed tongue), it arrived mildly warm/cold. They also give you a green sauce which is cold. I have been here with my family more times that I can count and it is a staple for my family when we have guest visiting from out of town. I can say that this was my worst visit. The service was good after we were seated but I which it could have been better, especially with all the wait. I will not order the tacos again. Usually order the Don Francisco (steak).",

The parking lot isn't huge, but it holds enough cars to get by. Inside you are greeted by an abundance of workers. The uniforms they wear add to the authentic ambiance of the location.   You feel pampered here, because there are so many people making sure you are taken care of.   The food... is good. The chips and salsa disappeared off the table fast. But they were quickly replaced with more. We tried a couple different burritos and they were all packed full of flavor. Three grown men and all of us were stuffed walking out. There was no way we could even think about dessert.   It is not as convenient to get to as the other locations, but I think you'll find it worth the drive to check out the Lindo Michoacan that started them all.",

They said it was tradition for them to stop by on each Vegas trip. It's now become my tradition too. We stop in the last morning of each trip.   I'm from the hospitality industry and I have to say I've NEVER been to a restaurant with such warm, inviting, and natural hospitality before. Everyone there seems so happy to be at work and so happy to great you. Everyone greets you as you pass them, not just your waiter but management and other servers stop by you table to check on you constantly. The customer service is superb. Smiles everywhere and everyone willing to lend a helping hand. LINDOS  As good as the customer service is the food and drinks hold their own. From the delicious soup they bring you, to the chips w/ amazing beans, and all there great plates. The oysters are fresh without the nasty fishy taste. Tacos and flautus are crunchy and delicious. My wife loves there habanero sauce. Literally gets two containers to go every time. I'm not a big fan of fruity drinks but their flavored margaritas are so good. I usually have the raspberry margaritas as my dessert / final drink. Everything here is fresh, authentic, and sssooo tasty. My mouth is literally watering just thinking about this place. Can't wait to get back to Vegas to turn up and cure my Hangover at",

I've been to mexico, lived in southern california most my life, and been to the east coast's best mexican restaurants. This one nails them all. Freshly made, authentic guacamole on the table, delicious chips, mole, juicy meats, authentic dishes and deserts--they have it all. Highly recommended to you, your friends, family, x gf/bf's, x wives, anyone you've crossed paths with.  I never tried the drinks but the selection was amazing and the mood/atmosphere was much like mexico itself.   Don't skip this place, and when you go, eat as much as possible.",

Tonight we did not get that great service or food that we were used to. The food was just straight up bland. I order the whole fried red snapper and my wife 3 al pastor tacos, for the kids they shared 5 chicken flautas. My fish was fried so hard it was just a dark brown shell laced with bones. I might have got 3 bites of dry meat out of it that I had to eat gaucamole at the same time to swallow it. When we got to our table they brought us beans and salsa with a bowl of warm chips that were like crumbs out of the bottom of a bag of tostitos. They did taste good though. After we ate all of the big peace's we asked twice for more but they never arrived. I ordered a Long Island iced tea , it was so strong most people wouldn't like it but I did. My wife's tacos had to be salted to make them edible. The flautas were bland as well. We had to remind 2 people before we recieved our other two sets of silverware about 5 minutes after the food was served. The sopas they give you, we only had 2 for the 4 people that were there. Later they did bring us 2 more. Whoever cooked that meal for us tonight either was overwhelmed, having a bad night, didn't care, or just doesn't season right. I've never written a bad review on yelp before in the 4 years I've had the app but I thought this deserves one. Thx.",

Our waiter did not come to check up on us and was always in a rush when we asked for something and forgot what we asked for. The best thing here was the freshly made guacamole.

I am not making this up, but we waited close to an hour to be seated; we didn't walk out because we had a 20 min taxi drive from the Vegas Strip. So we would have wasted 40 mins n $. We kept asking how much longer and they would ignored us or just say a \"few more mins,\" we just have tables for smaller groups\" etc. Finally, we got seated at a booth for 4 people!; all they did was pull up a chair! Like seriously?! They couldn't do that from the beginning? If all they have are booths and tables minimum parties of 4. That's why I'm giving it a 3 stars. The food was just ok, the guayaba margaritas were delicious and the waiter was awesome.  They need to work on their reservation system or just don't have that option because it's just waste of time.",

With bright/busy colors, and \"Adelitas\" dressed female staff... a look that is far from current Mexico.   The food is geared more for bland palettes... A little better than a taco truck because it is served on an actual plate. But, the food quality isn't superior to warrant their premium menu pricing.   Chevy's restaurant (although Tex-Mex) has a more authentic feel and taste!    I'm rating 2 stars only because, they represent another option in town and the other for effort.   They are known for their margaritas, but nothing you haven't had before in any Mexican resort.   After going to 3 different locations of theirs (Including the one in Green Valley) this restaurant only gives their patrons a False a sense of status, but is lacking major points in food quality, service, food temperatures (SNHD) and overall experience of the place.   GM's take notes and hope you welcome constructive criticism to make your place a better option in town.",

    "text": "Authentic Mexican food, way off the strip (which is a great thing)!  Inside this place has a very authentic look and feel. While In vegas for work, a few of us decided to take a detour on the way to the airport for some Mexican.   The warm bean dip and smokey salsa served with the chips was really great!  The tableside guacamole was also exceptional, although I like mine with a little less onions and more lime.   For our entrees, we ordered street tacos, chicken enchilada and fajita burritos. All were well made with quality ingredients and came out hot and fresh.   I would definitely eat here again if I was visiting Vegas.",

It's was not bad but nothing out of this world. I had the don Francisco which is arrachera with and enchilada it was all really good and a decent portion after the appetizer chips and salsa I took half home. The service was really on point everyone was on their toes the whole time. My 4 year old son loved the vibe he was clapping and singing to the music.",

I've been to the one off of Twain on the west side, but this one is even better (and that's saying a lot!).  The staff, to begin with... SUPER FRIENDLY. Our server explained everything on the menu we had questions about and did it with a smile even though it was super busy and noisy on that particular night. Other people who weren't serving our table even stopped to make sure we were okay.  I ordered the chimichanga de camarones (shrimp chimi) and oh my Jesucristo -- que bueno! Flavorful, zesty, and DEFINITELY filling. It is not for the timid eater. You know who I'm talking about... \"I'll have a quarter of a salad and some water -- oh no, wait, I'm full just talking about it.\"  I'll be back to try more tasty items for sure.

When they bring you your chips they come with salsa AND beans. The Sopa de Fideo is a little bit of home when I'm on my business travels. My favorite thing to get here is the Al Pastor taco plate with nice cold Michelada.  I'm not a huge fan of any of their seafood here, but their original take on the classic steak more than makes up for that. Pretty sure this place has been on TV a few times.  Parking kind of sucks during dinner time, thankfully they have a large lot in the back.",

The shrimp ceviche was fresh and delicious, the cheese enchilada was the best I've had, and the beef dish I ordered was out of this world...then came the FLAN.

The food was delicious and of large enough portions so that I had enough for a second meal (did I mention I love leftovers?).  The best part, though, was the margaritas. Absolutely delicious and come in two sizes. I got the regular size which already looked huge, but then I had two so maybe I could've pulled off the large size. Though I was admittedly quite drunk after my two margaritas; tequila tends to sneak up on me like that.  Their happy birthday is quite festive and involves what appeared to be a mariachi band; I would enjoy bringing someone who is embarrassed by public announcements of their birthday to this place.",

Everything from  the decor to the people that work there is great.. The service is exceptional... Your drink is not even half way when someone is already replacing it.. Food is great, very good portions. They place chips, beans and salsa while ur seating down deciding what to order. We ask for the guacamole n ohh it's fresh n so delicious you can't stop eating it. You got to try this place.. Whenever I'm in Vegas, I will definitely go again.",

She was very amazed with the attentiveness of the waiter. As soon as we got there we received our chips, salsa and beans. All the food keeps getting refilled at half full, the menu is very good. We had four different plates ordered and all of them were delicious. Even though this place is not on the strip it is worth the extra miles to get good authentic Mexican food. Guacamole is made on the spot with all fresh ingredients, the staff makes you feel at home they are super friendly and make you feel at home. Service is fast. Free refills on traditional Mexican drinks (nonalcoholic, of course).  All these things keep us coming back. The flan does have a strong rum flavor and is too sweet for our taste.",

I ordered the vegetarian burritos and they were awesome! The server was pretty good too. Paid good attention to how we were behaving at the table. Checking on us quickly in the beginning, but noticed we were too busy conversing so switched to checking on us every ten minutes or so. I also think he had a thing for my date, as he never really looked at me when he came to check on us! lol! All good. Just shows he has good taste!  All in all, a great experience and I would eat here again, but have to be honest when I say I'd go to Carnegie or West Flamingo locations first. Nothing against this location, just my preference of area and atmosphere.",

However, we didn't even get a refill on our water.  The food was pretty tasteless.  My daughter posted a vine about the absent server because it was so obvious.  Now at least I can say I've tried the famous Lindo Michoacan... don't have anything good to say about it. For the price, the quality was sub-standard.   Bloody Mary came in a thick, narrow glass so the content was very small - it was overpriced and under-tasty, too.  I'll stick with Taco Bell for a better Mexican meal.",

The salsa was like sucking on a delicious curling iron; they aren't dumbing down the heat for tourists. The tableside guacamole had six or seven ingredients and renewed my love for it. I think every facet of the meal was homemade, from the tortillas to the enchilada sauce. The menu is extensive and obscure to this Tex-Mex aficionado, but I will return to try everything.   Makes me wish I had given fewer 5-star ratings to other establishments, cuz this one is truly in the top 1%",

About 4 years ago I was in Vegas for a convention and my cousin took me to Lindo Michoacan for dinner one night and I was blown away.  It is the type of Mexican food that makes you want to sit at the restaurant for three hours just to not be full so you can start eating again.    My wife and I were recently in vegas for the NASCAR race and when we met up with my cousin again we did have plans to go to a nice steakhouse but nope....we changed those to get some of the best Mexican food I have ever had...again.  My wife could believe the size of the burrito she ordered and everything....everything was just as good as it was 4 years ago.   Big time props to Lindo Michoacan and next time I am in Vegas you will see me again.",

The staff did a good job of maintaining a good atmosphere by playing music, singing songs, and being very interactive with all customers.   A lot of choices looked very good but I settled with a plate of Chicken Fajitas with flour tortillas. The food was good, nothing I can complain about or really hype.

The other table gets drink and their order taken before he even thinks about taking ours then walks away.  No water in our glasses I am out of my beverage from the bar I have to wave him down and get him to come over to me I ask for the bill because I am tired of dealing with idiots and then all of a sudden he wants to be the best waiter in the restaurant.   I told him not to bother his manager because I didn't want to waste his time.  There is nothing that the manager could have done even if he spoke with me to please me after this visit here.   Yet to remind you that I live 24 miles away from the restaurant in North North Las Vegas.  Needless to say I will no longer go back to visit this restaurant.  This is the first time that I got so mad that I left a restaurant.  I am a chef and I know that sometimes people are busy but when half the restaurant is full that is not busy.  It just means that you knew someone to get the job and trust me the only break this guy got was when they hired him.",

This has got to be some of the worst and most overpriced mexican food we have ever had, even with the coupon.  This place was packed with white people and not many mexicans except for the servers.  2 people in our party were mexican and the both said this was just a glorified taco bell.  Food was covered with white/yellow goooe oily cheese. portions were small.  My friends called the free sopa de fideo, sopa de calcetenas (sock water)  It had no flavor and just a tomatoe colored water with pasta in it.  Guys, there are much better mexican restaurants in town.  I dont know how this chain stays in business.  The prices are $$$$$$$$ $19 for any seafood, $14 for combos, $15 for chicken dishes.",

I never understood why it was so popular, it's what I call a 10 year restaurant. That's a place where I eat and don't really like the food; then after 10 years of people telling me how good it is, I think maybe I missed something. So I try it again and am reminded why I did not like it the first time, 10 years ago.  We ate here again recently because it was open late. The meal was disappointing as usual, nothing was terrible but nothing was good either. We only ate about half of our meals and did not get containers to take the leftovers home. It's kind of pricey also, about $100 for two, definitely not worth the money.  Las Vegas is not a great town for Mexican restaurants like LA or San Antonio are; tacos yes but restaurants not so much. There are however two places in this same part of town that are far superior and cheaper than Lindo Michoacan. El Ausente and Hacienda del Rey are much better choices and better values as well.",

Even when they messed up our margaritas they were quick to fix it and even took one drink off the bill and asked if they could get us anything else.  We took a cab there and when we we getting ready to leave they asked if we'd like to use their shuttle back to the strip.  Overall, I was really amazed how well we were  treated.  I was so impressed by the service I could barely focus on the food but it was good.",

    "text": "The food here is fairly tasty and the service is good.  Mainly, I lowered the rating because of the ridiculous pricing.  I am from a border town in Texas where just about anything on Lindo's menu would sell for $12 or less.  A plate of chile Verde shouldn't be 20$.  We aren't on the strip and there is no valet parking.  The only way I would consider going back is for lunch, where many of their plates are nearly half price.  The portions aren't extraordinary either.  If you're a tourist from the midwest and Mexican food is scarce, you will love this place.  Personally I'd go across the street to the restaurant in the La Bonita grocery store and stop by the bakery on the way out.",

    "text": "It took me one bite of the salsa to know that the food, no matter what I ordered was going to be great.  I live in San Diego, which is fairly close to Mexico, and as such, has plenty of good Mexican food, so when it's bad or average, I'm going to recognize it. My personal theory is that the farther you get from Mexico, the worse the Mexican food becomes. I don't normally write reviews, and the reason I'm writing the review isn't because of the great food, it's because of the extra mile they went.  Actually, probably quite a few extra miles. More on that later.  Initially, I wasn't so sure I was going to love it as I knew nothing about it other than our friends had chosen it after some research and the shuttle was coming to get us(a group of 9) at the Aria(new hotel, central on the strip). A word of advice for anyone staying @ the Aria: good luck having a shuttle pick you up. This hotel \"has two main entrances\". Seriously, they both might as well be main entrances. This will no doubt cause some confusion for any shuttle driver coming to get you. As a result, we were off to a late start.  The story of the restuarant is kind of cool. Apparently the guy learned to cook the Michoacan style from nuns at a semenary. Transalation: authentico!  I don't even know the name of what I ordered. \"Linda's plate\" or something.  It's basically chicken w/ a specially prepared sauce.  It was fantastic.  Quite a few of the dishes appear to feature specialized sauces. I won't even go more into the details of the food than to see we all loved what we ordered, and much of what's on the menu is unique and not something you can find anywhere else, or at least, do not often find, or when you do it's \"just ok\". When in doubt, as your server, they will not lead you wrong.  Other highlights include the Mariachi band which played 4 songs for our group. They were great, and are something that I personally love. Reminds me of being a gringo tourist for some reason.  The reason for the review, however was the service. everyone was friendly, but where they really went the extra mile is that one of the members of our group had forgotten her purse in the shuttle on the return trip, but she didn't realize it until after the shuttle was already on the way back to the restuarant.  In case you are not aware, Las Vegas is probably the worst city in the world to run out of money.  Losing your purse it kind of a big deal. They have our sincerest gratitude for finding the purse(with everything in it of course) and droving all the way back to the Aria just to drop it off for us and save us the cab fare it would have required to get it. For that, we thank them, and for that, they get a glowing review.  To summarize: Totally worth going.  It is not always easy to find good Mexican food, and this place has great Mexican food.If you have questions on the menu, ask the staff and enjoy whatever it is they give you.  They will definately take care of you.",

I also got a cadillac margarita that tasted like they just lazily put the alcohol and margarita mix. For $12 bucks a pop I'd expect something better and after I told the mesero about the drink he had them make me a new one which was much better so that's why I'm giving this spot 2 stars. Pretty okay customer service but the food... I've had better cooking from my mom.",

He screwed up my order, but since he never came over to see how things were, I ate it anyway.  Also, my friend ordered a soda, which he never brought.  We will be looking for a new place for lunch!",

One of my favorite things about going to a Mexican restaurant is the chips and salsa, but was soooooo let down with how bad theirs was. Just a nasty chip with a dark red sauce that you can tell is just chili powder. My GF and I tried several items on two combo plates, and nothing stood out. Just all very mediocre.   The one good thing about our experience was the service. The service was amazing. The guys watching our group were on their game, and really impressed us. So if I could, I would give 5 stars for service and 1 star for food. If I could give my rating an over all 2.5 stars I would.",

For me drinks/cocktails are important and they sure as heck passed the test on that.   They serve bean dip, salsa and chips as soon as you arrive.  I like that! It was pretty authentic considering that this restaurant is in Vegas.  For dinner I had the chicken enchiladas w/green sauce.  They were Delish! Just make sure you ask for your soup or salad if it comes with your meal because they forgot to serve me mine and I didn't realize it until I was already in the car.  Regardless, I'll definitely try it again when I'm in town & craving Mexican food. Enjoy!",

Although you may order the typical dishes you would see at other Mexican restaurants, our table ordered some of the more unusual items such as Buey Al Cilantro (rib eye with verde sauce) and Carnitas a la Coca-Cola (pork cooked in Coke). The flavors were great. Service was pleasant and prompt. Not impressed with the cramped width between our booth and a nearby table of twenty nor the AC blowing directly on us. Why the 5 stars? For focus on the customer.  We had a $15 cab ride from the LVH to the restaurant but were delightfully surprised to be offered a ride back to our hotel via their own shuttle at the end of the meal (no charge). Good job!",

My wife asked for puntas de filets de albanil its steak with onions tomatoes and jalapenos I had a hangover and ordered me a menudo. Before the food arrived they bring you chips and salsa and some bean . also with your order you get a fideo soup really good.

I am only one guy so I tried a combo plate for a little variety.  The Chile rellano was actually pretty decent, not quite homemade, but very good.  The other diners in my group were all very happy with their food.  The entire meal was well prepared.  THE SERVICE  I think this is what seperates this place.  The service is very good.  It is fast with out anyone trying to hurry you up.  Plenty of refills and they remove plates, bottles, ect... promptly.  There seemed to be a sincere welcome felling - as if you went to persons home...  THE VENUE  This place has been in the same spot for some time.  It has a bar with 3 seperate dining areas.  It is plenty big enough.  It had a charm to it - they didn't over do it or try to hard.  Very homey.  The place appeared to be very clean too.    THE INTANGIBLES  The restaurant was jam packed full of Mexicans.  I was even dining with Mexicans.  My logic is if the Mexicans like it then it must be good.  Not that they are culinary experts but they do know something about mexican food.  The place just has a good vibe to it.  It feels like a mexican restaurant.  Also, It is locally owned and operated.",

Our server decided to dont serve us a margarita and a beer for one of our female guess, she is 21 years old but looks like 18 . Anyways the server jaime dint try even to be in our side !!! The only star in this review is for WALTER the busser he always with a smile and very fast checking our table , managers EDDY AND EDGAR just pass by many times not even look at us , they are a couple of JOKERS walking like a big AHOLES. So people go somewhere else for a happy hour cause this place is gonna look for an excuse to dont serve you !! What a shame on lindo Michoacan.",

Large portion.  The servers were prompt and friendly.  We had reservations and our table was ready when our party arrived.  We love the authentic atmosphere with empty tequila bottles of all brands on display   We especially enjoyed the chicken fajitas, the garlic chicken (Gallo Mojo de Ajo), the steak Chile Colorado. Mole  Ploblano The flan was also very good.  Dinner prices ranged from $15-$19.   What we didn't like:  the restaurant is noisy and some tables are noisier than others.  We were near the live music so it was noisier this trip.  The traffic from 5 -6 pm will make it a 35 min taxi ride from the strip.   So consider a later dinner.   We really enjoy ever meal we've had here.",

Our food was brought out rapidly and our server and the manager kept checking up on us to see if we needed service or anything else.

Like most people living in the Southwest, I've had my fair share of Mexican food. This wasn't even in the top 15. The carne asada plate I ordered was beyond basic. The carne asada had no flavor. The beans were room temperature and congealed in a pile on my plate. The rice was dry as all hell. Basically, what I expected as far as my meal, didn't happen. The Cadillac margarita was also Chili's level. Meaning, next to no flavor. There was an abundance of alcohol- so I got my money's worth in that regard but it wasn't appetizing. The decor and service is what earns this review a 3 star rating. The food itself was two stars at best but a whole additional star is for the service and cool decor. I've heard about this place for years and now that I've visited, I'm wondering what all the excitement was about in the first place. Definitely won't be returning. Just not worth it.",

From their friendly employees to their rich and delicious food, they really know how to deliver a wonderful experience that leaves you satisfied every time. This round I tried one if their lunch specials that includes a beef taco and a cheese enchilada, with beans, rice, soup and a soda. Between this and the chips and dip you get with every meal, it fills a hungry stomach and was absolutely fantastic.",

Chicken breast and Enchiladas de camaron enchiladas Verdes And on top of that when I came to pick up they gave me the food in a Beer bud light Box. While all the other  to go orders were in bags mine was inside a box  The staff didn't even believe I got lindo Michoacan for them lol  never again will I order to go The food is mediocre  for what I paid",

And being greeted at my table with chips. salsa, and some of the best bean dip I have ever had, I was in heaven. We ordered some guacamole for the table, that was made fresh right before us!  I also ordered a strawberry margarita, which was relatively sweet, but they typically are. I sipped on the \"skinny\" lime margarita, which tasted much stronger than mine, likely because of the flavor combinations.   After about three bowls of chips, quac, and bean dip, I was pretty much too full to eat my veggie fajitas. However, the fajitas came out with homemade flour tortillas. I had to keep going. The veggies were flavorful and went well with the rice and extra beans. SO good.  Finally, the table shared some of the creamiest flan I've had. Now I just have to mix up my remaining veggie fajitas at home and keep the party going.",

Though if you're planning lots of convo with your lover, request a seat toward the back, because a mariachi band plays live music. Better yet, stop yapping and listen while kicking back with a cocktail because the band kicks ass! These are pros, folks, playing violins, trumpet, guitars--super tight, with festive songs and beautiful singing for the ballads.   The service was attentive, efficient, and friendly; waitstaff never far. The food is just right for the price point. I had a steak enchilada with the house mole, dark and rich, with subtle layers of cocoa, nuts and spice ($15.95) My date had Gallo al Conac ($16.95). Don't know how it was made but he was swooning over it. The house margarita is $9 each. We paid $4 more apiece for the jumbo (make it a double!). Fried ice-cream, aka Lindo Flameado ($8.25), was the logical and delicious choice for dessert. We were celebrating my friend's birthday on a Friday night, so it was the perfect fiery and fantastic ending to our meal. He blew out the flames shortly after dessert arrived and made a wish. He didn't let the liquor burn off on its own, so a very rummy spoonful was his reward, lol!",

The food was just ok. I've eaten    Mexican food for over 35 years. It was just ok. 3. The margaritas were the worst I've EVER had. You can't be a good Mexican restaurant and have terrible margaritas.....  With that said, I won't return when I'm in Vegas this September for another Mayweather fight. I had read so many positive reviews but I was thoroughly unimpressed. My reputation as a foodie took a hit from the group I had brought there....",

    "text": "I've frequented Lindo Michoacan many times with no complaints & rated them with high stars. Tonight was by far the worst experience I've ever encountered. According to Louis (shift manager) at the Desert Inn location, Lindo Michoacan requires the customer to provide I.D. with debit card purchases. I asked him why? He said, \"it's because the machines process debit cards as a credit card.\" I then told him that sounds like their problem, not the customers problem. I also told him debit cards do not require an I.D. due to the card requiring the customer to input the PIN # that signifies it's their card. I then asked him how would he handle the situation had we not provided an I.D. & he said, \"I don't know.\" However, he claimed they started this change in policy last month. As a manager you should have the skill set to problem solve & exceed the customers expectations. Not only did Louis have no answers, he was unable to come close to meeting my expectations. Therefore I will not frequent the restaurant anymore & I will ensure my friends & family are aware of the horrible experience that occurred.",

    "text": "I ordered the Michoacan Cobb Salad. It came out with no bacon nor tortilla strips as described on the menu. I asked the waiter for the bacon, apparently he did not understand. He returned 10 minutes later (this is during a work lunch break) with a new salad, this time, without the chorizo and still no bacon. My coworker translated to him in Spanish that I wanted bacon. He then told me after going to the kitchen that the chefs were cooking it. Well, the bacon never came and no explanation either. When it was time for the bill I told one of the drink servers to have the price of my salad reduced by $2.25 (the cheapest cost for sides at the restaurant) because the bacon never came. He did not understand, so my coworker had to translate to this fellow too. The original server then tried to offer me a free dessert which I declined- the whole point of getting a salad was to have a healthy lunch. I asked for the manager. The server tried to give me a free dessert again, so I asked to speak to the manager myself. The manager never came but did reduce the bill by 25%, which was fine with me because I did eat some of the salad and I wasn't trying to get a free meal, but it kind of sucked because of the whole situation I didn't even eat most of it (plus, the salad was not really that good). The rating is based on the salad but the service might as well be the same.",

I am not an animal, I know what really matters in this life.  Living in many facilities across the southwest I have learned the difference...the desire...the NEED for great Mexican food in any happy persons life.  Some poor souls go through their pathetic existence never realizing this need. Occasionally, these poor dumb bastards get a sudden sense something is wrong...something horribly terrible is wrong...that sudden cascade of fear...the wave of distress...they look for their keys, they call their love ones...everything seems fine...but it isn't...they have never had real authentic Mexican food!  I have spent many a night in Las Vegas...hung my head there many times. Always with a ton of money or no money. Always alone or with a woman who I pay by the hour. Regardless of my luck, regardless of my company...I always fill my aching head at Lindo Michoacan.    The carnitas are something that should be classified as a national treasure. The carne asada is rich, flavorful and exceedingly special. The Pollo Amador is ridiculously amazing. The Steak Ranchero is tender and well seasoned.  The Guacamole is...well...it is out of this world. It is one of the few guacamoles i would actually pay for. I always think you should make it at home, but this is the one exception to the rule.   There is one last thing I need to say.  The meals are great, the fried rice and refried beans are amazing...but the burritos are not great. They are very good, they are worth trying once...but they are not the best in town. I would stick to the meals.  Eat the food. Enjoy the hospitality. Always wear a hat at an all nude circus.  Thank Rex Marvin. You love him.  He would love you, but he can't love anyone.",

    "text": "What a great place.  My fiancee and I were in Las Vegas on vacation and wanted to eat some authentic Mexican food like we do back at home, and this was what our friends suggested (although there was another location with a better view but we couldn't get the GPS to find it).  The inside of the restaurant is comfortable, nothing fancy just your typical layout.  The server we had was polite and very helpful.  We ordered the Guacamole appetizer and I knew we were in for a treat when he came out and made it right in front of us after asking us how we would like it tailored.  It was fantastic, probably the best guacamole I've had.  Unfortunately this lead us to eating three baskets of chips, but that's the side effect of being in Vegas and not being able to control the pig-out factor everyday.  I really wish I hadn't eaten that many chips though, because the meal I got was crazy delicious.  They have a lot of menu choices and a lot of specials, all of which sounded great, so I didn't really know where to begin.  I was contemplating between two of the chicken dishes and asked the waiter what he preferred.  He pointed me to a third dish; the Pollo Sarandeado, which turned out to be right up my alley so I'm glad he persuaded.  I was skeptical at first, as the sauce was a blend of peppers and some kind of mayo which I'm not typically a fan of, but this was sublime.  It turned out to be one of those meals where you can't stop eating even though you're so full but then you stop anyways because you're THAT full.  I took the rest back to the hotel in a doggy bag and then forgot I didn't have a fridge to put it in.  Sad times.  Bottom line though, get the Pollo Sarandeado.  My fiancee had one of the burritos and she was equally happy.  The drinks came around a little slow, but they have a team of waiters and usually the ones that aren't yours will still be good about refilling chips and keeping an eye on things.  Overall, I wasn't bothered by the speed at all and the food / politeness more then made up for it.  Really happy I tried this place and I'll easily give it a big recommendation to any visitors.",

Their enchiladas are my favorite, but then again ... If it has melted cheese in it, on it, or near it, I am going to order it.  They give you fresh tortilla chips and their house salsa plus bean dip upon arrival, and it is all mucho yummy, although the salsa is a little HOT for this gringette.  I'd prefer pico de gallo, but that is just me.  Very good Mexican food served in a lively environment by a friendly staff.

Everything, and I mean everything was on point. Some of THE BEST service I had EVER seen in my life and I've done a lot of eating out. Water glass 3/4 full? Get ready for a refill within seconds? Chips almost completely killed? Refill is brought right to your table before you can get the last chip. The staff is very welcoming and friendly as well. Hostesses all greet you with bright smiles and the waiters are very polite. Food was near perfection as well, no complaints at all there. My brother's burrito was literally the size of a football!!! Only thing I have to warn people about, DO NOT plan to eat here if you plan on going out that night. You will be so incredinly full that you will be embarrased to show your 6 pack if you have one. I sure as hell know I nearly needed a food coma and went directly to my hotel room and took a 2 hour recovery nap from my lethargicness. Then I got a call at midnight from the friend who said come down to the casino and I sure as hell did. Interesting night!",

I didn't eat my food and my husband was disappointed too. I ordered carnitas a la coca cola and it was like BBQ pulled pork to me. Hubby had chile Colorado and didn't like the chile they had on it. We were bummed thought we found a gem in Vegas but turned out not to be out style",

    "text": "\"Tastes like home!\" - say my Mexican friends.   This Gringo is partial to Mole - that tasty sauce with a poblano pepper and cocoa base. They do a fantastic job here! Highly recommended!  I also love the fresh, made-at-the-table guacamole, done any way you like (extra extra cilantro and lime por favor!)  If you've never had beer done as a michelada, this is a good place to do it. The beer/hot sauce/lime combo might seem odd at first, but it is a delightful (and very Mexican) accompaniment to a traditional meal.  I find the much-celebrated margaritas to be far too sweet. Sometimes I can get the bartender to make me a drink with fresh limes and no simple syrup, and it is great! Usually though, it's just a sugar-bomb with booze. Maybe I just haven't figured out how to properly order what I like.  TIP: Be aware of the music situation when you arrive. The amplified keyboardist/singer is a good musician, but can get *very* loud. I prefer to sit far away - or even in another room when he's cranking them out. The roaming mariachi band is festive and fun.   All-in-all, I prefer a hole-in-the-wall taqueria for my Mexican food. But for a fun and friendly dining experience with a FIESTA! ambiance, you can't beat Lindo Michoacan.",

    "text": "A friend from work highly recommended this place and you know what, he was right.  Original Lindo Michoacan was fantastic!  Our waiter quickly brought our drinks and some complimentary hot chips, salsa and bean dip while we looked over the menu.  Now while I could have gotten full just eating those wonderfully hot chips and dip, I had to stop myself from eating them all up so I could save room for all the other food we ordered.  We went with the Queso Fundido with Chorizo, the Enchilada Tarasca and some Carnitas a la Mexicana.    Omg the food was glorious!  Super flavorful, filling and tasty.  I only wish I could have eaten more.  The Queso Fundido was the most deliciously gooey combination of cheese and spices.  I wish every day I could eat me some of that cheesy goodness.  And yes I do love cheese that much.  Then my lunch special that included an enchilada filled with cheese, beef and chicken ... drool worthy.    Everything and I do mean everything I tasted was delicious.  In fact I was only planning on eating half of my food and taking the other half to go to eat later, but that didn't happen.  The food here was just too good.  My friend, who is a pretty picky Mexican food lover, absolutely devoured all of his as well.  We both thouroughly enjoyed eating here.   I will definitely be back the next time I'm in Las Vegas.",

The best thing about this place is the customer service. Everyone is so nice and so attentive. It was my sister's 21st birthday so they sang her a song with guitar and all and even gave her a shot and a churro desert! The food is delicious. As soon as you sit down you are offered chips with beans and salsa. Not only that but they also give you a nice little warm bowl of fideo soup. The food is very fresh and delicous. And the tortillas...OMGSH. They're homemade and soooooo good. I've never been to another restaurant that made hand made tortillas!! They really do treat you like family as soon as you walk in the door. The decor is also very authentic and you can tell the decorations were brought over from Mexico. You really don't find too many restaurants like these anymore.Can't wait to go back.",

Everything on the menu is great but what has been my favorite all these years is the mole poblano. Everyone is always nice and the owner has never forgotten us and always takes time to say hi. To me this is the best mexican restaurant in vegas and even though they have multiple locations nothing beats the original. However make sure you are prepared to wait because from the time it opens to the time it closes this place is busy and something that has been that busy all these years has to be good.",

I was ok with that for a few moments until people started bumping into our chairs going back and fourth to the kitchen. As we sat there we watched the hostess seat a party of 2 in a large booth that would have accommodated my party so I asked the hostess why she sat us there she just looked at me and said \"I have another booth available do you want to move?\" YES I would like that! It just got worse from there, I though they had mariachi and maybe they do but I guess they don't play on Saturdays or they didn't the day I was there. Now to the food. We are Mexican and all I can say is that it is very American Mexican. The food didn't take very long however when it did come out it was cold! It was just a very bad experience from start to finish.",

Lindo falls somewhere between 2 & 3.  The food tasted good and they did have a few select authentic Mex dishes on the menu (I had the goat) but mostly it's just Americanized Mex food that is available in any town across the USA.",

    "text": "Muy delicioso! This place has amazing Mexican food. It's so good that I'm writing this from my table after just finishing dinner here. There are pages and pages of specialties that you don't normally find in a typical Mexican restaurant in the US. I highly recommend the Mole Poblano, which is thinly grilled chicken breasts covered in a delicious brown mole sauce. It is hands down the best chicken mole I've ever had. It has a bit of heat but not too much. It is served with fresh, made in house flour tortillas. Most meals are served with fideo soup (noodles in a tomato broth), which my wife stated was very close to the one her Mexican grandmother used to make. The atmosphere is festive with live music and Mexican art, objects and wares as decor. A short drive from the strip, it's definitely worth the effort if you have use of a car, as we did. I found this restaurant on a <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FUSAToday.com&s=bad18fa9641d73a7bc5ba2a49cb31a3d54a6235414c89708d28f6f12ff4500fc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">USAToday.com</a> city guide which mentioned that of the four locations in the area, this one on Desert Inn is best.  Note: I originally wrote this review on Jan 3, 2010 and posted it on TripAdvisor at the time.",

It was as if the carne asada was prepared hours before, and then put in a microwave to heat when i ordered it. The chips/salsa/beans they gave was pretty good though.   A group of about 7 of us went to this place around 12p on friday and the service was less than stellar. Our waiter was kind of a moron, and he didn't seem to understand how to split checks, or write down our orders correctly. I'll stick to robertos/faustos/amigos/etc. I won't be back.",

I'm a vegetarian so the food choices are limited.  The decor is very cute, totally looks authentic and the hostess have typical dressing on.  They always provide chips salsa and bean dip before the meal along with a small noodle soup which is extremely delicious! I completely recommend you get the large guacamole which they prepare in your table, it's amazing.   Since I'm a vegetarian I always stick to either cheese enchiladas or burrito with no mean but other than that they'll be able to accommodate for you if you ask.  Birthday are great to spend there that sing for you and give you a free tequila shot! Most definitely one of the best Mexican restaurants in Las Vegas!",

Lindo Michoacan is a must stop for me and the wife when we come to Las Vegas. We're in Vegas at least one or twice a year. This is where we come for dinner and margaritas.  This time I tried the chili verde which comes with \"you guessed it\" rice and beans. Ta da.  Eshi go some sort of shrimp and avocado salad in the avocado shells. It's was da bomb.  My food as well was off the hook. But my wife's food was to die for. Man U could have that and some chips with a margarita and be set.  The waiters were very attentive and friendly.

The menu has a lot of options which was a bit overwhelming for me, but I liked that they had Vegan options and the fact that some of the order names on the menu were after towns from Michoacan which I thought was cool! The overall feel of the restaurant is very spot on to Michoacan  considering my parents are from there. I went with the Zamora plate I believe which was #13 . A burrito that cal with green Chile sauce and another burrito with red sauce a side of rice and beans.They do  start your course with fideo soup which is nice! Biting into the burrito with the Chile verde sauce it want spice at all I was kind of disappointed because I feel like it lacked the authentic taste of a Michoacan plate. It was more like an Americanized version of Mexican food. I definitely didn't like the red sauce burrito I felt the sauce was to watery and no flavor. Overall I'm unimpressed but did like the restaurant decor and service!",

The atmosphere was great, the staff was friendly and attentive, and the prices were reasonable.  However, the food was nothing special.  Everything was just bland.  The soup was basically a very watery tomato soup with noodles and no seasoning.  Our entrees were both OK, but again bland and lacking in flavor.  Overall it was a mediocre, slightly disappointing experience.",

We arrived at 8:15 and come to find out they gave our reservation to someone else because according to the hostess they were an unexpected big party. We asked to speak with a manager several times and the manager never had the decency to come and talk to us and explain why he gave our reservation away. Very unprofessional. I understand they are busy but if someone makes a reservation you hold that reservation. We were not late we were 15 early and they tell us there is nothing they can do because they have other reservations to honor. How is that my problem I don't know. I wanted to give it no stars but I could not. The food is ok. Certainly not worth the wait.",

So I was utterly shocked when I ordered carne asada and was brought an unseasoned dry piece of meat. When I say unseasoned, I do not mean light Mexican spices, I mean completely unseasoned. Complaints among our group consisted of store bought tortillas, canned refried beans, and dry meats with absolutely no flavor. If this is what Las Vegas has to offer in terms of Mexican dining, I would recommend skipping out. The only positive is the nicely decorated restaurant.",

We were a party of 10 & understand that they are a super busy place. First off, my brother in law ordered chilaquiles with a fully cooked egg & they brought him a medium over easy. He returned the plate & the 2nd time they brought his plate it was the same thing. He ended up cancelling his plate because they messed it up & took forever. Most of our food was cold & we had to return everything twice. It was horrible service. My carne asada plate was super cold & not good at all. My neice & mother in law ordered tacos, when they brought them the tortilla was super cold. We returned the tacos 3 times because they kept coming out cold. At the end, they still wanted to charge us all the plates but 1 order of tacos. When we asked to talk to the manager, he came to say he was sorry then left as if he didnt really care. Manager was rude, didnt really care about customer service!! Never going back to this place. Bad service, food wasnt good at all & they took forever.",

One of the \"drinks\" we ordered, a simple glass of ice, never came. I even asked a second time but it did me no good. We also never got our sopa de fideo that comes with each meal. After our dinner arrived we saw very little of our waiter. Honestly the bus boy gave better service and more of it. Had to wait for the check too. In extreme circumstances this may be understandable but it didn't even seem like the place was packed.   The saving grace was the food. Both the pork and chicken were tasty. I also enjoyed the salsa verde and my family seemed to enjoy their meals. They were a little skimpy on the rice and beans and the guacamole lacked some flavors IMO (salt, lime, cilantro) but it wasn't anything worth fussing over. It's a shame that the service was such a letdown. Good food + bad service = a poor dining experience. Bummer...",

    "text": "Some places are just a part of my experience with this city that I never think I to review them.  That's Lindo. It's part of Vegas' culinary landscape. Established in the early nineties, it's one of a handful of businesses in this town that seems to evolve and grow with the city. They have managed to find new ways to remain relevant and, even current, as the times, and tastes, change.   This place remains a go-to for many for local Mexican food. They are very consistent in the product. The service is always solid and they do a strong job of providing an experience for diners. Touches from the live music to the table side guacamole preparation give this place a customer friendly energy. The staff at Lindo wants you to enjoy yourself. The place will be packed when you go as many locals count Lindo as their top choice for Mexican food. I suspect much of that goodwill is based on the energy and \"excitement\" of the place.  My primary issue is weak flavors and overly tough protein--specifically chicken. Like I said, they're consistent. Dishes like Chile Colorado should be fork tender. They never are. The food has changed some from when I first started coming to Lindo. The flavors seem to have turned down two notches and the delicious dishes that were once \"delicioso\" are now best categorized as \"good\".  But this may only be a problem for me since I hear so many people say they LOVE the dishes at Lindo. I fall more in the category of loving the IDEA of the dishes at Lindo.   The updated, glossy new (as of a few years ago) menu boasts a wealth of options: pork, appetizers, fish, beef, chicken, etc. I have wondered if the effort to expand the menu has led to the decline in the quality of the dishes. On my latest visit I tried the Enchiladas de Mole. It was safe and filling. But in fairness, that's all I was expecting.   There are no layered or even punchy flavors to challenge or excite the pallet. But I don't think that's what Lindo is about. And that's ok.  They provide good food for a reasonable price.   I will continue to pop into Lindo for parties or with large gatherings and I'm glad to see that many people appreciate and frequent this local business.",

I was excited when we were invited to a friend's birthday party tonight. I couldn't wait to try it.   (I love spicy food to the point that I make my own salsa because the store bought stuff isn't hot enough)  When I ordered, the waiter told me that he was Mexican and couldn't even eat it. He told me that I shouldn't order it and try something else. (I guess he said this because I am white ?)  I told him it was ok.  The waiter then asks if I had tried it before. Well, there has to be a first time for everything. Let me try it !  Again, he refused. He said I should just pick something else on the menu and he will bring me a side of the sauce.  No, I want it just like the menu describes it !!!!  At this point everyone else at the table was looking at me because I was delaying the order for the other 16 people in our party.  I finally became irritated that I was being treated like a 3yr old and he was telling me what I can and can't eat. I just ordered a Quesadilla in hopes that he would allow me to order it.   He did bring a side of the sauce which I was left to dip chips in. It was indeed hot, but not as hot as advertised. It had a decent flavor. I ended up taking the Quesadilla apart to get the steak out and dipping it in the sauce.   I left very disappointed that I couldn't order the meal that was on Food Network.  I left very disappointed that I couldn't order the $20.99 meal that was listed on the menu.  I left very disappointed that I couldn't order the single item that made them prominently display the Food Network logo on the outside of their building.  I could have just gone to Taco Bell for a Quesadilla.  DO NOT GO HERE EXPECTING TO GET THE \"CRY TODAY, CRY TOMORROW\", they will refuse to serve it.",

    "text": "3.5 We decided to have dinner here on a Sunday night with a couple of friends. To say this place was busy would be understatement of the century. Luckily, there is a huge parking lot behind the restaurant itself. The restaurant is actually a lot bigger on the inside than it appears to be from the outside. It appears that this is the spot for celebrating birthdays because once inside, it was nothing but large parties. One con with that is the annoying mariachi band birthday song every 10 minutes. The staff is friendly even among all of the chaos. It may have just been that particular night, but surrounded by a huge crowd, just sitting in the waiting area was making me feel like I was going to have an anxiety attack.  We were finally seated and presented with chips along with bean and salsa dips. The chips were fresh and both of the dips were fine. I opted for the carnitas while my husband went with the steak ranchero. My carnitas were cooked well, but had it not been for the additional sauce they would have majorly lacked any flavor. My husband's steak ranchero was just that...a piece of mediocre meat smothered in melted cheese. I would say in comparison to a place like the Red Iguana in SLC, this place falls way short in therms of \"best\" Mexican food.  The prices are decently reasonable relative to the portions, but not necessarily to the quality of the food. With that being said, I'd say it is still one of the better sit down Mexican food option in Vegas.",

Did I mention I'm from Phoenix originally and there's a thriving Mexican/Sonoran culture there? Then, to make things even more amazing, there's a live Mariachi band, even dressed to the 9s, and they sound fantastic. The food is of course delicious, and I especially recommend the guacamole and the \"Don Francisco\". The best part? There was an area blackout! In fact the power is still out as I'm writing this! And, in True Mariachi fashion, the band *literally* played on! What an incredible experience!

    "text": "Had just finished playing golf at LV National and yelped for some good Latin cuisine. BOOM...Get out the way, get out the way Hommes...Lino Michoacan 1.2 miles away. (yes, I know it's not Hommes)...anyway so I've been eyeing LM for over 6 years peeping the one in Summerlin when I lived out there but never went because I thought it a chain and you know, I'm a big supporter of Mom & Pops local but I went and was blown away.    Door opening, smiles all around, everyone took ownership, everyone cared; it was refreshing.  Bathroom check...clean!  Boom. Smelled good, looked good. First thing I check when I go to a new spot is the lavatory.  If they care there, more than likely the Cocina is limpiola...Clean.    They have chicken Mole!!!  I've not had good chicken mole since I was in Berkeley.  When I have breakfast at a new place, I always have the corn beef hash. If it's legit, then I come back.  If it smells and tastes canned, well... you know.  If I'm having lunch or dinner at a spot and they have Fish and Chips, I check that.  If the fish is frozen and water comes out when you bite, well again, you know the deal.  Can't do it and won't go back. Don't skimp on the shrimp. I do a Mole check for the legitimacy of a Mexican restaurant.  Our drinks arrived quickly and like a ballet, the chips, red AND green salsa and a small bowl of REFRIED BEANS arrived shortly after with the freshly made in the hizzy chips. Thick chips, lightly salted, crunchy good.  The salsa were fresh, made in house I'm certain, visualizing  un Abuela supervising the making of the sauces and every aspect of the making and delivery.  The entree arrived.  Chicken Mole... mmm, mmm, mmmm.  Wish I took a pic...did I???  Anyway, I digress.  The sauce was smooth, glossy brown with that reddish hint of under tone.  The mouth was delicate and flavorful, the nose was aromatic and filled your olfactory senses with pleasure.  The chicken was perfectly seasoned and cooked, succulent pieces of tender chicken breasts.  This was legit.  Rice and beans on the side, both perfectly prepared.  I'm a big guy and I could have taken the doggy bag but I finished.  My golf buddy didn't grind and took the bag.  Whatever.   If you go, you will be happy and perhaps surprised as I and my ATM was happy too.",

    "text": "Wow! I frequent the Lindo Michoacan in Henderson that I live right by, but I stopped at this location for lunch while I was in the area. Let me start by saying that being from the Bay Area in California, I am a hard judge of authentic Mexican food, and I rarely ever find restaurants out of California that live up to my expectations. This location on Desert Inn of Lindo exceeded my expectations by far! First off, the service was amazing. Got sat right away, ambience was great and reminded me of my favorite Mexican restaurant in California that went out of business. Their chips and salsa are to die for--I mean seriously, like the best salsa I have ever had. They bring bean dip too. The lunch specials are amazing as well. This visit, I ordered the Chile Verde lunch special for only like $9, and my iced tea was included in this price (score!), and it was seriously the BEST Chile Verde I have ever had. Normally, I stray away from ordering this dish at restaurants I have not been to, but this was just ridiculous. When I typically order it, there's fat on the meat. In this case? Nope, not one bit. So so tender and delicious. Their corn tortillas are incredible too. My server Miguel was awesome! I hope to get him next time I come in. He offered great suggestions and was attentive and very friendly. He even gave me a tip on what to order next time I am in! Thanks Lindo Michoacan, I'm so glad I finally found the best Mexican in Las Vegas.",

Very disappointed, was a very special day, I did everything on my end to prepare and they dropped the ball. The young girls behind the counter were extremely rude, rude enough to repeat myself. I will never go back and let my friends and family know about our experience. I emailed them asking for the owner just to make him aware. Manager emailed me back and I told them I wanted to talk to Javier, the owner, still waiting. I waited long enough, This is my review.",

Maybe they were thrown off by having such a large group to serve? Went last Saturday night. Aside from zero flavor, quality was good...",

I order the tongue in red sauce it was wonderful. My friends dishes were all excellent, per them. It was my birthday so the staff had a little ceremony with sombrero, shot, and desert. And a song.

We were a party of three and each of us enjoyed our lunch. I believe this place is very popular among locals. We had to wait for 15 minutes to get a table. Special Thanks to our waiter Fredy who checked with us frequently if we needed anything. The salsa that came with Tortilla chips was amazing. We kept finishing the large bowl but was always politely given another bowl by Fredy. He understood we loved those chips and salsa. As our order for main course was getting late, we ordered guacamole for the chips. It tasted even better with guac.  After 3 bowls of chips and a couple of beers, we got our main course. I have ordered for \"Tia Esther\". My friends have gone with \"Gallo al Chipotle Estilo\" and Enchiladas. They serve tortillas with all the orders. All of us liked our dishes. I wasn't able to finish mine but had the leftover as a snack later.",

While the service and speed is to be admired, the food, beginning with the flavorless salsa, refried beans, and soup that they give everyone leaves something to be desired. Let me preface this by saying that I lived in Houston, Texas, for seven years and I am a foodie who knows great Mexican and Tex-Mex (this is neither). The food here has no flavor. My mother ordered the Red Snapper and sent it back because it was rank!!! We never send back anything. My father's beef and chicken enchiladas tasted like the meat and sauces were prepared the Saturday before (we came on a Wednesday). The fajitas tasted like fajitas that someone who has never eaten fajitas, but ran across a recipe for \"Mexican food\" in a Betty Crocker cookbook and \"tried them out\". Do not spend any money here, it will be like you are simply lighting a pile of money on fire and just watching it burn while you walk away. This restaurant is so not worth it.",

At the table next to us a customer was being a jerk and the wait staff was still super friendly and handled the situation in a class act textbook style. It was our child's birthday. The Mariachi band played at our table had him wear a giant sombrero , put a candle in the flan, and gave us a complimentary birthday shot of tequila. We are going back again this Friday for another birthday celebration. First class , class act place. Avg price 15-20 pp.",

I ordered the combination came with carnitas taco, chicken Tamales, chili relleno, rice, soup and salad. The food is good but don't expect home made style food. Its more like upper scale food. However I like more home made style its just my preference.",

Once the large group next to us left we went from attentive service to empty glasses and searching for our server)  Now for the good part...THE FOOD:  You get seated w chips, salsa, and bean dip (the chips were nice & warm/the salsa had just enough heat) After we ordered... Yummy Soup came!!!  I order the steak quesadilla w guac : Idk if i would say the guac was the best in Vegas... It was good.  The quesadilla was stuffed with steak & very yummy!!!

So I liked what I read about Lindo michoacan and decided to give it a try and I was glad I did. I am not sure if this restaurant is for everybody because if I were to take my grown kids there they would not appreciate the authentic Mexican food, because they have not been exposed to it, the only food they know about is tacos, burritos, enchiladas, tamales, chiles rellenos, nachos, etc. As soon as you browse the menu you realize that this place is different, they have dishes that you would find only in restaurants that specialize in certain kind of food or at your grandma's house. For instance they have Mole Poblano and Pipian. I ordered Camarones a la Tampiquena. They were delicious, I had that nice flavor in my mouth for the rest of the day. Yeah, the chips, the salsa and the beans dip are OK but in reality I never choose my restaurants based on that, to me the main dishes are the ones that count. Definitely, every time I'm in Vegas from now on I will go there to taste another of their tasty dishes.",

Fideo has always been one of my favorite Mexican dishes but you never see it offered in Mexican restaurants so I always just make it at home. I'm bummed that we tried it on vacation and that I can't go get that soup whenever I want! Every time we are in Vegas we will surely be back. Don't get me wrong the rest of the food was amazing as well! So flavorful and portions are huge! I had the carnitas and it was some of the best I've ever had. Great beans and rice and hot fresh tortilla chips for every table. The ambience is so fun and inviting and the drinks are strong! My friends ordered the garlic shrimp and the chicken fajitas and they loved their food as well! Like I said the portions are big but that's a good thing in my book - two meals in one! Even cold, because we didn't have a microwave in our hotel room, the food was still yummy! Being half Mexican and growing up privy to so many delicious, authentic recipes - I was skeptical, but this place does not disappoint!",

We were out of chips and water for a good 10 minutes and when we ordered table side guacamole and ceviche we again had no chips so it was a bit frustrating. Joel came and made everything better. Offering suggestions to the courses we ordered. Made us amazing table side guacamole. Extremely attentive to our drinks even though our original waiter made no apparent effort to completely any steps of service. Adrian was the name on our receipt but Joel made the experience.",

    "text": "My family and I ate here last night because my husband had been wanting to go back since he had it a few months ago.  The first impression of the restaurant was the ambiance, it was very homey and vibrant with lots of colors.  The wait was 20 minutes, which wasn't so bad considering it was 7pm on a Friday night.  The waiting area did get pretty packed but is understandable considering how busy the restaurant was.  My daughter had to use the restroom, there is only 1 mens restroom and 1 female restroom but surprisingly there was no line.  I wish I took a picture of the bathroom because it was super cute with super cute colors and decor that matched the restaurant.  We sat in a booth which was comfortable for us being a family of 4.  They brought us out chips, bean dip, and salsa which were great starters and delicious.  We started off with the table side guacamole, which was so good! But we agreed that we would just order the regular guacamole next time per the price difference.  It was nice to experience once but no necessary for our next visit.  My husband got the #3 Uruapan which comes with 1 chile verde pork & bean burrito, 1 cheese enchilada, and 1 chicken taco. He devoured that thing so fast, he enjoyed every bit of it!  I got the camarone borrachos, which was okay.  I mean I ate the whole thing but I probably won't get it again especially since it was almost $20.  I also ordered my kids the quesadilla which they shared and enjoyed.    We all loved the restaurant especially the mariachi band.  They were soooo good!  The only reason why I took a star away is because it was cold in there.",

We were very excited to find out they offered this option since we didn't see it on the menu. But when we took the first sip it was seriously lacking in flavor. I asked the waiter if they used piloncillo? He said no that it's unsweetened so that the customers can sweeten to taste. WTH!! We went back and forth on what constitutes a traditional cafe de olla. Then he says.... well we don't make it in a pot it's from a machine....SERIOUSLY!!! Then why in the heck would you offer it as such!?! In that case just call it cinnamon flavored coffee!!",

    "text": "Wow, this is my first Yelp review in a LONG time, because this place was incredible! This is a service oriented review. The food was great, but the service was the best from an entire staff I have seen in a long time. (Forgive the spelling of any names.)  It began with our welcoming greeting. Immediately when we walked in we were greeted by multiple employees and were promptly taken to a table. Yes it's off season here, and it was a Tuesday, but every staff member was pleasant, kind, and efficient from our waiter Yahalmo to the busser Mescha.    Briefly, my mom flew from Georgia to Los Angeles for her 70th birthday... She did not know that I was going to drive her to Vegas and surprise her. On top of that my brother flew in from LA, too and met us in Vegas. I had already researched many Mexican restaurants because, well who doesn't love a solid Mexican place. Also after a day of traveling, and it being our first of three nights, I wanted a place a little outside of the main madness.   Once we sat down, we were promptly noticed by our waiter Yahalmo.  We were a little \"hangry\" and my brother demanded guacamole asap. Yahalmo was quick and friendly and made us the perfect table side guacamole! Form the quac and queso appetizers to our entrees, everything was delicious!!   Our family has worked in hospitality for many years too, and it is probably the reason I have stayed away from writing a Yelp review, because one experience does not mean that that is how a place operates. (So unfortunate how unforgiving small minded people can be, and it can devastate a business) Also, to maintain a home style feeling takes consistent commitment from the owners. Understanding that, I had to review Lindo Michoacan, because every single person we came in contact with at this restaurant had a smile on their face and treated us like we were home!   You have to also understand that in the United States we care more about service, and having lived and worked in Georgia, Texas, New York, and California in hospitality, I truly feel lucky to have gotten this staff on this night, because they were some of the best!   Infinite gratitude team Lindo Michoacan! Your smiles and friendly treatment was noted and appreciated!!   And of course, it helps that your food was delicious too!   And thank you for creating a memorable experience for our Mom's 70th!!",

Took another 15 min for waters, and we had to continually ask for refills, more chips, tortillas, etc. For the drinks and chips we had to ask twice because they forgot.  The fajitas were good, not great. I've had better. Atmosphere was chaotic, and far too loud to even hear someone across the table from me.   Just not impressed.",

Inside there was a band and they come and sing for people who are celebrating birthdays. If you are looking for a quiet place to have dinner this is not the place!  As soon as we sat down they brought fresh home made corn chips, salsa and bean dip. The menu was very extensive. We ordered guacamole that they made front of us and it was the best! Every thing was very tasty and prices reasonable. Next time in Vegas I will definitely be returning to this restaurant!",

There was a good mix of people from all ethnicities and age groups, and there was also a mariachi band performing. They were entertaining to watch, but I felt bad for the table that had these trumpets blowin all up in their grill.  We started off with their complimentary chips and salsa. Also shared a mango margarita with my wife. I'm sure many people have experienced this, but I always get too stuffed from eating all the chips and salsa that I only end up eating half of my entree. The salsa and bean dips were really good, and the chips were hot and fresh. We also ordered a side of guac, and it was nice and chunky.   For the entree, I ordered the two taco combo with shredded beef. It was ok. Tasted just like Roberto's shredded beef taco but just less oily. My wife got the chicken taco and chicken enchilada combo, and besides the enchilada being a little too mushy, she enjoyed it.   Not the best Mexican food I've ever had but definitely one of the better Mexican restaurants that Vegas has to offer.",

A guy sitting at the bar next to me came in to just have some drinks. I asked the bartender if they comp drinks for gambling and she said yes. She looked at my account and said I hadn't played enough to get a drink. By then, I had played for about 2 hours with the same $20. I wasn't losing but I wasn't winning either. I was frustrated because I was playing a $1.50 a hand and still they said I had to put more money in. That didn't make any sense. The guy sitting next to me said he wanted to try something so he put $100 in his machine played 2 hands & cashed out. They comped all his drinks! I called the manager over to explain what happened and he could care less. He even said I was in on a scam with the guy who I didn't even know. I cannot believe the poor treatment he gave me and the poor customer service I got from the bartender. I WILL NEVER GO BACK HERE AGAIN!!!",

At first glance it seemed like a eclectic place with all kinds of stuff hanging on the wall.  We got there at about 6:30 pm and there were a lot of open seats, but by the time we left they were packed.   Upon the recommendation of the waiter I ordered the Carne Asada with mushroom creme sauce which was really good.  My friend ordered the    Red Snapper.  I tried a piece, kinda dry probably should have went during an off time so the cooks can better prepare the dishes.  The plates came with beans, rice and some shredded lettuce.  Hawaii guy in Vegas",

Our drinks were not the best (ordered a cantarito and squirt seemed flat & a Cadillac margarita that lacked flavor of tequila).  The food seemed like there was no TLC to it.  I ordered the chicken with cream, and the rice tasted like it came from the box and beans tasted like them came from the can.  The chicken was very thick and non flavorful.  I came from Santa Fe Springs CA to have a good time in Vegas, but always make it a point to eat here because previous times (been here with family, coworkers, and friends plenty of times before), but this time i have to say I was not impressed.  Maybe because it was the busy weekend, but something was just not right.  Don't know if I'll come back again to this place....only time will tell :(",

I usually get something different each time, knowing full well I will be happy with whatever I order. The waiters and waitresses are so attentive and if that were not enough, multiple people will check on you throughout your meal and ensure your eating space is sufficient for ultimate enjoyment.

Appetizers - the salsa, the home made fresh made tortillas and the bean dip are great and never ending. Just ask for more and there it is.  3.  Food - So good, so much to choose from. If you are eating American style, they have lunch specials with all your popular dishes like Enchiladas, Burritos, Tacos, Taco Salad, and they have more interesting things such as tongue, pork chops and shrimp dishes.  The fish is great, the lunch specials are nice, but my all time favorite is the Caldo de Res.  How many places in NV can  you get this?  It is SOOOOOO GOOOD.  4.  Food part 2.  Forgot about the Menudo, and the tongue.  Lengua a michoacan or tacos de lengua, the beef tongue is great here. You know you gotta have a lot of people coming here to serve the more exotic things.   And, try not to order the burrito, mi amigo. That is like going to a steak restaurant and ordering a PBJ Sandwich. Tasty , but not what you order eating out!  5.  This place may be better than the new on on Carnegie and Horizon Ridge in Henderson.  A must to go.",

Needless to say we had excellent service, food and of course the drinks! They even gave each of us a free margarita and shots of tequila to the Bride to Be. We were also driven back to our hotels in their large van. Amazing night!!! We will definitely be back!!! Thank you so much.",

We went there for my daughters 21st birthday this week and we were a very large party. They had our table ready for us when we arrived and were constantly taking care of us from start to finish!!! Jaimie our waiter was awesome!!  The food was delicious!!! Everything I tried was great, but my favorite was the shredded beef taco!! They even asked us if we wanted separate checks. And when it was time to sing Happy Birthday, all the staff made her feel so special!!! Thanks for making my daughters's night perfect!!! We will definitely be back!! Wish you had locations in CA.",

The food was great & the customer service was excellent. They forgot an order for one of the kids which sucked but it wasn't my kid, so I'm not holding that against them. Lol I came with a party of like 16 ppl so I wasn't expecting everything to be perfect. But it was pretty much close to it.  The plates are very large & my food was amazing. The waiters were amazing. They always came by to check to see if we wanted more refills. My husband wanted his food a particular way & they made sure that it came out that way. I can see what the big fuss is about.",

My mother ordered a carne asada medium rare, it was very dry and hard to eat so then she told the waiter about it. They are very understanding and cooked her another carne asada with new sides, they didn't just give her another piece of steak. It was way better than the other a lot more tender and soft. I on the other hand ordered a carne asada burrito. It was amazing and the meat was juicy and tasty. The size of the meals are pretty good for one person. Everyone was nice and polite as we entered and left.",

However, based on yelp reviews we sucked it up and went in.    Interior is nicely decorated if not a little dark in one room.    Service staff were outstanding across the board.  We ordered guacamole which was prepared table side.  Fresh ingredients make such a difference!  Neither of our friends \"liked\" guacamole, but I can tell you they helped us polish it off down to the last chip!  Margaritas were very good.  Beers were cold and served with chilled mug which is always a nice touch.  Entrees were all outstanding.  Among the 4 of us we ordered 1 burrito, 2 Carne Asada dishes, and Carnitas.  All were excellent, with the accompanying homemade tortillas being an excellent treat!  and when I say homemade I don't refer to the tortilla pressing machine that I have seen in other Mexican restaurants.  Sylvia was making them by hand throughout the evening.  We love Las Vegas and go about once a year, and will definitely come to Lindo Michoacan again.",

FRESH, marinated with citrus and melt in your mouth to die for delicious.  The refried beans at the other Michoacan (Bonito) is better but this is still a fantastic place.

But, not as chilly inside the restaurant.   I suspect when we got there the ambient temperature was 55 degrees.  If any patrons had worn an outer garment into the establishment, they were still wearing it.  I did not wear a coat and  my feet to my hands were chilled.  The service was good and the lunch menu is priced competitively.  Nice decorum but, sorry, I just cannot get that excited about standard Mexican food.  All I see is an extra 2\" around my waistline without much payoff.  I mean, like 15 gingerbread cookies are delish and you know there is a price to pay.  But, seeing a visually uninspired enchilada with cheese and beans and still having to work an extra hour in the gym does not motivate me to go back.  Maybe that is why margaritas are so popular in Mexican restaurants....if you get buzzed enough, who cares?",

I don't make it here as much as I used to, as there are several other places in the neighborhood we choose to go now. The food and drinks here seem to be inconsistent. This goes for the other Michoacan properties here in town. I used to frequent the Flamingo/I215 one for happy hour, but the drinks are so hit or miss, we stopped going. I love the chips & salsa and bean dip here, and I used to be a huge fan of the tableside guac, but my last visit, it tasted he put an entire onion in the guac, I couldn't taste anything else. So I started adding stuff to it to doctor it up, salsa, salt, whatever I could. Didn't work. Margaritas are hit or miss. If you get a decent bartender who understands \"I don't want triple sec or grand marnier\" they can be pretty good, I hate artifical tasting margarita mix. Will I continue to go here? Probably, just stick the usual and don't stray from the chips & salsa & bean dip.",

However, they were able to seat us immediately, which was nice.    The interior is quite large, and subdivided into about 3 or 4 different rooms.  There is smoking in a small bar area that has a few video poker machines, but the smoke doesn't travel beyond it very far.  The walls and ceiling are festooned with various pots, artwork, and miscellaneous Mexicana; it is like a Mexican T.G.I. Friday's.    Service was speedy, accurate, friendly, and didn't miss a beat.  We started with the guacamole dip, which is hand-made to-order in front of your table.  GF thought there was too much cilantro flavor, but I liked it.  Food portions were generous (neither of us was able to finish our meals), though I wish there had been a little more zing to it.  It was good, without being great, if you follow me.  Anyway, our experience was a happy one, and if the food hadn't been missing that certain \"something,\" it would have been 5 stars.  Maybe next visit.",

Absolutely delicious!! They have 36 lunch specials that include a soft drink at reasonable prices. My 2 kids received fideo soup, very nice jester to keep the kids from screaming or crying before their food comes out. I had the carnitas when I tell you they melt in your mouth, they really melt in your mouth!! Incredible flavor!! My hunny had the 2 item cheese quesadilla and shredded beef taco. He gave me a bite. It was delicious! In the back in the middle section there is a lady handmaking tortillas, I wanted to kiss her...lol they were that good!

We all got our food & one of my boys got his food which was a torta with no meat. I flagged the waiter and told him it took a while then we told him to just make us a quesadilla like my other son had ordered . Well they brought him his quesadilla AGAIN no meat!!!!! Second time at this point I was irritated. I told Javier again. He took it and a few minutes later came back with the new plate which was suppose to be a quesadilla with asada. Well AGAIN, NO MEAT! t the end of our meal I asked them for a discount for the inconvenience my son had to deal with during his meal. Well guess what ..... the manager was told of the inconvenience and only decided to give me 10% of my sons meal which was 1.05$!!!!!!!!! Annoyed basically they made me feel like I don't matter as a customer . Oh well my food was wrong and it don't matter if it's not ur fault ! I will think twice before I come back here again! I gave them 2 stars because the other staff did make a effort. What's 1.05$ off your meal when you keep getting the order wrong !",

    "text": "I'm the trade show coordinator for my company.  It's my job to book accommodations,  flights,  transportation, and find a restaurant to hold our company dinners. We have two major shows and one happens to be in Vegas. I discovered Original Lindo Michoacan on yelp and I read a lot of great reviews. I booked our company dinner her last year in October but before that in July 2015,  I came with my boy friend. I decided I wanted to try it out to give my thumb of approval. Let me just say, they did not disappoint. The service was amazing from hostess to bus boy to the entertainment. They start you off with home made chips and salsa and refried beans! Soooo good! The drinks, especially the Margaritas, are perfect. Especially the organic Margarita. Once you place your order, they bring you a small bowl of fideo. They have a variety of food to choose from including vegetarian. Since July 2015, I've been back here 5 times. Twice with the company and 3 with my boyfriend. Most recently on October 18th. The CEO asked me to book the dinner here again.  I highly recommend the Pollo asado with rajas de chile y crema, served with rice and beans with homemade flour tortillas. This is my favorite dish. The carnitas soaked in coca cola is pretty good too. The birria de chivo is good and I'm picky about birria de chivo. If it smells nasty, I won't eat it but theirs is legit. It doesn't smell nasty and is delicious with cebolla and cilantro. This time around I ordered Pollo asado al mojo de ajo! And it was just as tasty as the other dishes. Real authentic Mexican food. I wish they would open up a location in LA. They have 3 locations in Vegas. If you're in town and want legit Mexican food, I highly recommend this spot! There's a reason why the were voted #1 in Vegas. They do not disappoint.",

I've had regular Mexican food and I've had the ribeye.  today I ordered the pork in Coca-Cola sauce and I believe I was given the complete wrong dish.  although I complained to management they said I had the correct dish.  it was supposed to be chunks of meat in a dark thick black Coca-Cola Adobe sauce.  My dish was shredded pork in a red sauce.  It was dry, had little flavor and was hard to chew, yuk and it was barley warm.  After pointing out these issues to management And to make up for it they gave me a whopping $1.80 off the $50 bill.  I think this will be my last visit here as it was not a good experience.  So I saved $1.80 score, REALLY.  When a customer complains, make the issue right.  Comp the dish for heavens sake. Don't make excuses, just make it right.",

    "text": "I've decided after my first meal here that table-side guacamole making is an important life skill that everyone should have. Like learning to drive a stick shift. Or knowing how to replace an air conditioning filter. When you're two Asians and two gringos in a Mexican restaurant, you know you're doing something right when even the Latinos around you are ordering the table-side guacamole.   I got the 3-taco plate and opted to get one each of carne asada, lengua, and al pastor rather than getting three of just one type of meat as the menu listed. The al pastor was so awesome - sweet and juicy, but the carne asade and lengua were both on the blander side.   I'd come back though - tacos are tough to perfect, especially when everyone feels like they've found the Fountain of Tacos out of their coworker's neighbor's abuela's cousin's pickup truck in the garage and no longer see the value of paying a premium at a sit down restaurant. The menu here is extensive, and I definitely saw a lot of items that caught my eye for a next visit. On top of that, the service is genuine; you don't have to habla espanol to have the servers be at your every beck and call.",

On a Sunday night, the place was hopping with tourists and locals. The guacamole made tableside could have used riper avocados and maybe a touch of salt, the pico de gallo was flat. My wife had the garlic shrimp, again they lacked a bit of seasoning. I had the bacon wrapped shrimp. They were very good. Overall, we enjoyed our service and the dining experience..The food was good, but not great.",

    "text": "I hadn't been here in 13 years, this place used to be the best. Now not so much, after being seated we waited a long time before our waiter acknowledged us. Many wait staff walked by and nobody offered us a drink of water. Then the patron in the table in front of us walks to the register to complain about something and they go find \"our\" waiter. He then stopped at her table and they conversed and he left again still no drinks or anything. I'm starting to get annoyed. Then several minutes later he brought her cocktail and she decided she wants to talk his ear off and yet he's looking at us and not making the effort to end the conversation. Finally I started making loud comments were talking 10 minutes without any service, it wasn't busy either. He finally comes to us, we placed our order. Then that chick gets up like every few minutes to speak with the hostess and a manager comes to her table and she talks her ear off. Then a random patron starts conversation with her and she says how she's a stripper lol   -fast forward-  Our food arrives I had combination plate chile relleno and taco. The chile relleno was disappointing the sauce wasn't good no flavor, like a can of crushed tomatoes was dumped on it. The taco had half a cup of shredded cheese and lettuce not much to it. My husband had fajitas they were mediocre . Not once did our waiter check on us, the guy with the refills was the only one doing his job.  Conclusion: this place isn't what it used to be with quality, service and price increases don't coincide with this place. Thumbs down",

We order food and my brothers soup was cold and my steak was buey  al cilantro and it was like with a white sauce and mushrooms wipe off and the green sauce just on top. Send it back came back in less then 5 min but it was medium and I was asking for medium well and the worst part it was the manager who took it back and bring it back. So I send it back again and I decide not to get it back because everyone was almost done. The same  manager came back to the table and she only said we're busy and we try to everything came out fast and good, but some times we miss some details. She don't said sorry, just said that she'll took it off of my check. Wow what a service. Sorry but I don't think we'll be coming back.",

    "text": "This restaurant probably served me the worst steak picado I have ever eaten in my life, and I have tried this plate at a lot of establishments. The steak chucks were hard, and were super tough to chew. The meat seemed old, and if not old then just cheap and tough. The sauce that the meat was cooked in was rather bland and flavorless. I had to ask for their extra spicy sauce in order to add some \"pizzaz\" to the food. The soup appetizer that came with the meal was pretty good though, so I give them some credit for that. If it wasn't for the soup this place would get 1 star vs. the 2 stars that I am giving them for this experience.   The menu seems to be more tailored to the tourists and is not the traditional Michoacan dishes that I have eaten at other places. For someone who isn't up on what \"real\" Mexican food should taste like, they may like it here, but for me I give this place two thumbs down and a big ol' YUCK!. Never again. This place is totally over rated!",

I appreciate that so much!!! they were super friendly, super attentive and so fast. we felt welcomed, it's a happy environment. I had the Camerones  Abuelito Timo (bacon wrapped shrimp with Timo sauce) BOMB!! I dunno what Timo sauce is but I'm down with it. I ate all of it, rice beans. lettuce, gauc, shrimpies all gone. clean plate status. I got a taco on the side cuz I thought 'oh its just a few shrimp, I'll be hungry still ' I was wrong lol and took the taco home. after the chips, salsa and bean dip, the little soup starter they give you, the shrimps and beans and rice and gallons of iced tea lol, I was perfectly full. my husband had the Carne asada, he said it was bomb and it sure looked it, but he wouldn't let me take a picture cuz he is a butt. AND to make it even more perfect, there is a PokeStop at the restaurant and a gym!!! we literally were able to get the poke stop over and over from our table, needless to say we stocked up on pokeballs. and we took over the gym :D #goblue and we caught a buncha  pokemon. it was a great fun dinner. I cannot wait to go back. so happy I finally tried this place!!!",

It was more of a flavorful heat vice a mace to the face zomg heat. The sides were nice as well, beans were top notch and flavorful as well as home made.   I picked my friend's left overs and the Camarones Sarandeados are simply amazing.

For around $14 u get all you can eat, 1 Alcoholic drink, Unlimited Drinks(including mexican drinks like Horchata, etc) Unlimited fresh handmade tortillas & Salsa/Dips.  The food had plenty of choices and were AUTHENTIC homestyle cooked foods. Some of the Choices included: Scramble egg dishes like \"a la Mexicana\" & \"with Chorizo\", They had salad & Nopales. Chilaqueles (Red & Green), All kinds of Mexican Stews like \"Beef Chile Rojo\", \"Chile Verde(Pork)\", FANTASTIC Carnitas(Bone in), Chicken Mole, Camarones ala Diabla and other classic mexican Meat stews. The BIRRIA de Chivo(Goat) was my favorite dish(topped with Onion, Cilantro and lime), my running mates said the MENUDO was fantastic but i couldnt stop eating the Birria so i didnt try it. It was so good all my buddies went again on Sunday but i decided to skip brunch and just workout the hangover lol. The Brunch ends at 2pm so my buds ordered Enchiladas verde de Pollo(Chicken/Green), Carne Asada Soft tacos(with Handmade tortillas), Caldo de Res, Enchiladas Rojas de pollo(Red/Chicken) and a Chicken Quesadilla to go. Everything was between 4-5stars, The Green Enchiladas & the Caldo de Res were perfect 5 stars. I also enjoyed the fresh table-made Guacamole, the salsa & bean dip with chips and the Flour hand made tortillas are awesome!!(corn are good too). The bathrooms are great and the atmosphere is very homey. SERVICE WAS SUPERB!!! The food was 5stars but when combined with the GREAT Service guarantees i will come here atleast 2 times everytime i head to vegas!! MUST TRY!",

The food was decent at best and  for the price range this would be one of my last pics for sure, the point is skip it one of the most overrated mexican food joints in las vegas",

    "text": "Anyone who's read my reviews of Mexican restaurants knows that I judge a Mexican restaurant, first, by how they make Chile Relleno... AND then anything else they might have.  My first impression of Lindo Michoacan was that this restaurant does not take Chile Relleno seriously, as the establishment serves it only as an ala-carte item or as an item included within their combination dishes. There are NO entrees with Chile Relleno by itself.... the waiter recommended that I order a couple of Chile Rellenos and just make my own entree... He just does not see the difference!  Chips & Salsa - Large crispy and warm tortilla ccrn chips. Very tasty and appetizing Bean Dip and a Red Chili Salsa concoction. FYI: my kids told me to take it easy on the Chips and Salsa during Lunch, as Lindo Michoacan charges customers at Lunch for extra Chips and Salsa! WTF!!!!  Chili Relleno - Abover average size Chile, but immersed in a very watery, very watery sauce. Relleno disintegrated while it was just sitting there! Ttalking to my Hispanic friends in California, I found out that Relleno are a very difficult item to make...  but Rellenos are also a staple of any Hispanic restaurant.  Camarones Ranchero - Immersed in a watery Ranchero sauce that was reminiscent of the Chile Relleno sauce.... coulda been the same sauce! For $16 the pricing is just way too much money for the below average preparation. There is NOTHING innovative about the recipe for this Shrimp in Ranchero Sauce entree that would justify the high price! Lindo Michoacan should apologize to every customer before seating them on their high prices and below average quality.   Tortillas - Hand-made, home-made flour tortillas.  Besides the Chips and Salsa, the best part of the Lindo Michoacan experience.  I'll temper my two star rating with my kids' above average ratings. They love this Mexican restaurant for some reason. The positives of the home-made Tortillas and the Chips & Salsa does not offset the negatives of watery sauces that smother the Chile Relleno and Camarones Ranchero compounded by the very high prices and below-average service.",

Ilove her for suggesting this place, because I can't wait to go back to try their other goodies.  We started with the guacamole and chips, and I was pleasantly surprised that they made it in front of you. Not just that, the music entertainer played a song, while our waiter made it. I thought that was a nice touch.  I ordered the huevos con chorizo and two steak tacos. They were both excellent especially the steak. Everything was fresh, and the food presentation was excellent. I had the chance to try my friend's meals, and they were very good as well. They ordered the steak with green sauce and the steak with cilantro. The prices weren't that bad, and you really get what you pay for (probably $25 dollars a person).  The service was excellent. It seemed like we had more than one waiter, and that was fine by me. They catered to our needs and made sure that we were satisfied. The music entertainment was quite nice as well. He was singing, playing the guitar, and keyboards.   I really wish we had places like these in Chicago. Yet another reason for me to go back to Vegas.",

I don't know if any one item really blew me away but the food from top to bottom was satisfying. I had the combination plate with a chile relleno, chicken enchilada and a tamale. The tamale, which was actually the reason I ordered the plate was probably the weakest thing I hate, but it was more than made up for by a good enchilada and very, very good chile relleno.  For desert we had the fried ice cream and, my favorite dish of the night, sopapillas. Both were delicious.  Now, having mentioned the food, I want to say that the part of the outing that made my night was the service. I've had plenty of good food at plenty of places--it's really not hard to find in Las Vegas. Finding a place that makes you feel great on a Saturday night purely by the strength of the service though? That's a lot harder.  Everyone who waited on us was smiling, prompt and very nice. Our bussers key our waters full and our tables clear. Our orders arrived quickly and everyone was particularly nice and interactive with our baby. If fact, during the course of the meal a lady brought us a stuffed burro from the restaurant and gave it to us. It entertained our daughter long enough for me to finish dinner.  I hope this evening was not an anomaly because I'm looking forward to this same treatment when I return. It really set this place apart and really made for a nice Saturday evening.",

Did I mention that I love mariachis? And they were not crappy ones either. But anyway I came here for dinner and drinks with some coworkers. They had mango margaritas which were tasty (and I don't even like mango) and I had a watermelon margarita which was very good. I could hardly choose what to get but settled on the Steak Ranchera (about $20) and it was delicious. They also bring you chips and salsa of course which were good but the little cup of sopa de fideo they bring before your entree was friggin amazing. I need to figure out how to make it like that cuz it was the bomb, I could just have a big bowl of that in the winter, with some tortillas.... mmmm. I ate til I was stuffed and had enough steak and rice and beans left for lunch the next day. Also my coworkers told me that they have $5 margaritas for happy hour? Regardless I need to come more often for mariachis and delicious generous food.",

I guess the only reason I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because the veggies were kind of funny. The veggies in our burritos were peas, green beans, etc. Kind of seems like maybe it came from a can of mixed veggies you would buy at the store instead of like grilled onions and peppers and stuff that I'm used to. And my friend ordered a chicken burrito, and there was seriously only chicken in it. No veggies or sour cream or cheese. Just chicken. Still tasted great! Just kinda funny :)",

It's very close quarters and you will know if there is a birthday, or anniversary, or any other event in the house (and there usually are about two or three!).",

Mine was just as stated in the menu (chicken, onions, and peppers), my husband made a few changes. The burrito was served with green sauce and cheese on it and guacamole on the side. I didn't finish it, and took the rest home. My mother in law got the chimichanga (hers was huge too). Her husband got the two taco combo. And the birthday sombrero serenade with three halves of a churro and whipped cream. was funny. The tequila shot was also complimentary. The server called it \"sugar and water.\" How funny.

    "text": "I really, REALLY wanted to like this place. I really did. The raves from my personal friends, all the reviews here on Yelp... I promise you, I had high hopes. But overall, it was just average.   I will admit that I am a bit \"Southern California persnickety\" about my Mexican food, but have a pretty good tolerance for even bad Mexican food.  It's grease and meat and cheese and hot sauce -- what's not to love?  Sadly, the food here was neither good, nor bad, it just... was.  Bland is the closest adjective I can give it.  The salsa was bizarre and had strange tangy-ness that was unexpected and off putting. The consistency was kind of like Cholula hot sauce, not a True salsa. The beans were beans, on the loose side, like a dip. Pretty decent, better than the salsa. The chips were fine.  We each ordered fajitas, he steak and I chicken with flour tortillas. The steak, I swear to you, had no flavor at all. It just tasted like cooked meat.  The chicken had slightly more flavor, but really, nothing to write home about. We saw spices on it, but strangely, there were none on our tongues. There was no zing, no heat, no depth, it was just... food.  Now, the tortillas -- those were awesome. Really good tortillas, freshly made.   Where they lacked in the flavor department, they did make up for in service. While we were initially forgotten after being seated way in the back by the toilets, after we reminded them we existed, they were extra attentive. Overly so, even.  I think they could tell that we didn't love our food, as we asked for a box after just a few bites (I decided to try my hand at improving upon the leftovers the next day.) So they were very concerned about us being happy. We said we were and smiled and nodded -- we just didn't have the heart to tell them we thought their food was mediocre. :(  They brought us extra hot tortillas to go, at no additional cost, so we were very appreciative and tipped accordingly.  The meal itself was pretty pricey for a mexican restaurant, in my opinion. $15-$20 a person -- maybe that's the going rate, but I'm used to more $10-$15 a plate, the high end for fajitas.  Our bill, without alcohol was $49, not including tip, pretty high for 2 orders of fajitas, if you ask me, but maybe I'm just that old fart recalling how it used to be a quarter to go to the movies. I don't know.  Anyway, I feel bad for not being totally in love with them. What they lacked in flavor, they made up for in customer service, so 3 stars it is.",

Lindo really shocked me however, with how much they sucked. We didn't leave from our 7 PM reservation until 10:30!!! Not because we were slow, not because we were chatting.. no because service was that awful. An hour to take our order, an hour to drop the check, etc, etc. You expect bad service on Cindo de mayo, but wow they really knocked it out of the park.   The first margarita from the bar was ok. Not great, ok. It tasted like it had some tequila in it, it cost $5, whatever, I was happy. We then proceeded to order margaritas at the table and like others have said - it was a glass of cheap nasty margarita mix. I consider myself an expert margarita drinker (5+ years in Houston will do that for ya!) and these were abysmal . I'd be shocked if they had more than 1/4 shot each of tequila and the mix they use is gross. A margarita with no tequila isn't worth $5, its worth $0!! Please just charge me $7 or something and actually put tequila in it.   I know there was some drama in our group about the spicy guac, but from a mild girl's perspective, the tableside guac was delish! If you don't like it hot you'll probably be very happy with the guac here.   I'm giving them 3 stars because the rest of the food was actually pretty good. The husband and I split the beef crispy taco and flank steak. Flank steak is actually pretty easy to screw up. Theirs was shockingly good. It actually came out medium rare. The flavoring was perfect. Portion was huge. Very damn pleased with our flank steak. Crispy taco was also bada**. Oh and lastly I'm a sucker for GOOD homemade tortillas. Their's were fabulous. Some of the better restaurant tortillas I've had in Vegas.   Overall, apparently avoid Cinco de Mayo, avoid the Margaritas, and get the flank steak.",

My Mom, on advice of a fellow ER Doctor, dragged my Father and I one day to Lindo .. back then, it was a tiny, one room restaurant.  Quaint, warm and the food was as authentic as one could get in Mexico.  We were thrilled.  As a family, we frequented Mexico quite often, so finding a proper Mexican restaurant off the Strip was a highlight back in the day.  Flash forward to present day, where Lindo has now expanded to a 4 room, plus bar, famous and popular restaurant.  My Dad has since become great friends with the owner, even traveling to Europe with Javier.    The food is what is most impressive with Lindo's history.  The quality has perfectly remained the same.  An older Mexican woman still stands in the middle of the restaurant, hand rolling out tortillas and frying them before your eyes.  The chips, pico de gallo and fresh table side guacamole is still amazing.  Everything on the menu is authentic .. the recipes are from inland Mexico .. this is not your \"Mexican Americano\" menu, but instead, True Michoacan fare.  After traveling all throughout Mexico frequently, and living in Mexican restaurant laden San Francisco and Southern California, Lindo Michoacan is still, by far, my favorite Mexican restaurant.  Now that I have moved from my hometown of Las Vegas, it is a priority that we dine at Lindo Michoacan each visit.  Although I am not entering that same quaint and unknown restaurant, once I taste the food, the memory of sitting there as a 10 year old comes rushing right back.",

While I haven' t made the effort to go to the strip and try the festivities, I have made the effort to order a margarita at the non strip restaurants along the west side of Vegas with no satisfaction. But I came here on a suggestion by a friend and I have to say that I have found my new margarita place. That's not to say that their drinks are their only point of recognition. There food is delicious and a fairly diverse menu. But what really impressed me, outside of the drink, was the service. All of the service staff was attentive and friendly. I wasn't stuck with my server, everyone made an effort to check up on the table. Whenever we needed something, it was addressed right away. I would highly recommend this to any locals or tourists wanting to try something outside of the strip. Come on in, order some food, and have a drink!",

I ordered a burrito- it was HUGE.  I have no small appetite and was only able to eat about 1/4 of it. We ordered guacamole- really yummy.  They make it up for you at the table.  We had some who like spicy, some mild, he made two bowls- one of each. My husband had chiles rellenos (his yardstick by which he rates any and all Mexican restaurants) and gives them a full five stars. Knocking off a couple of stars for the following: AC was off for most of our visit.  I don't care how good the food is, if you're uncomfortable the overall experience suffers. We had to relocate to another booth because we were sardined in.  The next table over had ample room for the 4 of us.  The soup they serve to everyone at the beginning of the meal reminds me of Lipton noodle soup. Bleh.",

    "text": "A mixed review here. The food was superb, but the service had problems.   This is a large place and easy to spot from the road. On entering the Mexican cantina atmosphere is recreated well. Just by the entrance is a small open room where senoritas are hand rolling stacks of fresh tortillas to be sent into the kitchen,.   We were seated immediately by the Maitre'D and our Margharita orders were taken and delivered very promptly.   After a short while a young waiter came to our table. His english was really poor and he either didn't understand or didn't know the answer to any of our questions about the menu. He brought over another waiter with slightly better english who we asked the same questions of. The reason we had so many questions is that my wife cannot eat food with any hot chillies in. She comes with me to mexican and Indian restaurants because they are my 2 favorite foods, but usually she can find something on the menu that she will enjoy.   Anyway the first course was a tortilla soup that was included with all meals. Delicious.   Then I had a combination platter of Beef & Bean Burrito, Cheese Enchilada and 2 Tacos. Again Delicious.   The dish that my wife had made sure had no chillies in came to the table coveres in a hot salsa! Obviously we sent it back with the waiter.   When, 15 mins later, I was nearly finished and no replacement had arrived I called the waiter and it turned out he had just taken back the dish without ordering a replacement without Salsa.   After this I insisted on speaking to the Manager, who was very apologetic and sorted my wife's meal out but it is hardly ideal to go out to dinner with someone and find yourselves eating 30 mins apart!   Like I said at the top, great food but it needs to sort out the service side before I come back. Especially as there are hardly a shortage of great mexican restaurants in Vegas.",

Let's start with, you can call the restaurant, and as long as you have more than 2 people, they will pick you up and drop you off.  Once you enter, it's a nice soft light setting.  I suggest sitting on the side where the one man live entertainment is located, it adds a bit of an ambiance.  Once your seated, you're provided amazing chips, with a refried bean dip as well as a salsa.  Order the Pina Colada, I guarantee you will not be disappointed.  I had the Chicken Fajitas, such a plentiful serving and tasteful meal.  I am unsure, but I do believe their tortillas are freshly made.  In the past, I have had their shrimp, which is also delicious.  Their service is phenomenal, they have a team of servers that stand by, waiting to help.  I can see why they have been voted a top restaurant, they never falter, and in every visit, I am guaranteed great food, time, and experience.  I must recommend you celebrate yours or your family birthday here, YOU WILL NEVER FORGET IT!  I need to end this review, I am becoming hungry and Vegas is far away!",

Then, while deciding from their amazing menu they also bring out a small cup of some very good fideo soup.  YUM YUM. The waiter was very friendly and attentive to our \"special requests\" and made some great suggestions. I will admit, I was hungry and I was a pig!  I ordered combo #1 with a taco, chile relleno and a cheese enchilada and all were really good.  The relleno was one of the best I have had and I have eaten a lot of Mexican food.  My wife had the \"Gallo al Conac\" and it was simply amazing, not the normal Mexican fare with more of a white cream sauce.  She loved it.

Their seafood Chimichanga is da bomb and big.  On Sundays they have a brunch buffet.  It's not the Golden Corral big, but they have good quality food.  They have a full bar (YAY!!!)  The drinks are good and I guess depending on the bartender there is that day you might get a bit more of a kick in your drink.

There's no view and parking is obnoxiously limited, but the service is fast, the employees are friendly, and the food is yummy.   This is where I come when I want to blow my low carb diet. The fresh made flour tortillas are so good that I usually end up eating several baskets -- and it is always worth it! The corn chips and salsa / bean dip are all super tasty too. The menu is large enough so there truly is something for everyone. This location does a big office lunch business because they have a great smaller portion lunch special menu, so expect crowds if you go during the workday.   My go-to favorites here are the queso with peppers as an appetizer (simple yet always amazing), the Pollo Con Rajas Y Crema Estilo Stephania (chicken breast with mild roasted peppers and a yummy cream sauce), and tasty chicken fajitas. A True local Las Vegas gem.",

We've been to the one in Green Valley, the one in the west near Summerlin and to this restaurant multiple times (usually convenience or other members of our party choose Lindo), and every one is just disappointing.  Pros for this location are atmosphere and service. Service is always great here and vibes are warm, friendly and welcoming.  The food? Bland, flavorless and overpriced. Two small, cheese enchiladas with a thin lake of runny beans and a 1/4 cup of molded rice? $11.50. Nothing tastes like anything here. No salt, no spice. The salsa is the only remotely flavorful thing and that isn't saying much. Chips were ok. Chicken on the taco salad is dry and rubbery. Mole was bland. My kid's chicken finger and fries meal consisted of seven wet, floppy steak fries and a very thin single piece of breaded chicken fried to a crisp and sliced into five pieces. Weird. He didn't eat it.  What is everyone else eating here? Are we taking crazy pills? This food is just not good.",

I was a bit worried because we passed through the dining room by the largest dinner party I'd ever seen. No joke, like 40 or 50 at one long table. (Making sense of the bus parked in the parking lot). Anyway I thought for sure our service would be slow. But not at all! Service was fast and very attentive. Food was super yummy. I had vegetable enchiladas and they were so good! Daughter had chicken quesadillas. We couldn't even finish half because we of course ate a bunch of chips and dip before our meal came! Our waiter was so nice. He was very busy but extremely efficient. He kept calling us his ladies. Also the live music perked us up. It was quite an enjoyable meal!  Also because I ordered the vegetable enchilada the waiter asked if I was vegetarian. I said yes. So he made sure to let me know the soup they bring out for a starter was chicken based broth. I felt it was very thoughtful for him to let me know even though I didn't ask or say anything about being vegetarian.",

We went in Friday both times we've been and by the bar they have a singer and they also have a group of Mariachi singers going around the restaurant singing Happy Birthday, etc. All of those who sang had amazing voices.

Michoacan was a pleasant change - everything was excellent.  There were only two downsides to the meal, which are pretty minor: the lemonade was fountain syrup stuff, or at least that was my impression of it.  Secondly, the mariachi band (Friday night) was great, but they are SO FREAKING LOUD that conversation is all but impossible.  It's not a big place, and a little brass goes a long way.  But those are minor quibbles.",

    "text": "My husband I were visiting Las Vegas and were very surprised at the very authentic and sumptuous Mexican food prepared at the Original Lindo Michoacan.  The Mojarra Al Estilo Puerto Nuevo was very tasty, meaty and properly cooked.  The A La Carte Chile Relleno was delicious.  It was a Pasilla Chile battered in egg, filled with cheese and had like a chile- or tomatoe-based sauce.  The Chile Relleno was bit small however it's authentic taste more than made up for this.   The Taquitos Dorados (appetizer) were made from thin, white corn tortillas fried to until golden and crispy, were cut in half and topped with letttuce, avocado, cheese and pico de gallo (white onions, chile and tomatoes) and were arranged into a beautiful and colorful platter.   The freshly hand-made corn and flour tortillas were delectable.  The corn tortillas were made of white corn (not yellow-colored).   The Sopa de Fideo was made from real chicken broth and tomatoe sauce - absolutely tasty even in 110 degree weather.   I know what authentic Mexican food tastes like. This came very close to my own cooking as well as my aunt's. The cost was very reasonable ($35).   The Servers and all the staff were very courteous and attentive.  The restaurant was aesthetically pleasing and had a pleasant atmosphere.  The restaurant and bathrooms were very clean.  Go to the Original Lindo Michoacan! You will not be disappointed!",

The food is muy authentico and the atmosphere is great with live music/great service.  Three stars because they have a disgusting salad option/(s?)... opting for something on the light side of fullness, last night I tried the seafood salad: an avocado shell filled with a cold mess of (too much) bland shrimp and avocados on a (mainly iceberg) lettuce blend. If canned shrimp existed, it would  taste like that in last night's salad.   They do have a cobb salad that sounds promising. I have faith in this place(one of few good places to eat in my neck of the woods) and will try it soon enough.  Lately, the guacamole has been too chunky and bland(ask for much lemon and less texture) and I concur with Keith that the complimentary soup here is lame and should disappear.",

Showed up here after a day of walking and shopping and I have to say Julio, our waiter, is fantastic and made the experience a memorable one by making recommendations for my party; who are a bunch of newbies to Mexican food.   The service was pretty attentive with our drinks being refilled and empty plates being whisked away without us asking or noticing.   I orders the garlic shrimp; which was pretty good, bf ordered something chicken salitas (?); the other two in our party orders a chipotle chicken and carnitas. The carnitas were probably the winner, but not by much.    The menu is a bit confusing, so if you get Julio ask him for help navigating the menu.  Do it.   The table-side guacamole is pretty fresh and tasty too. It is worth the drive off-strip.",

It's pretty difficult to find a good vegetarian dish that isn't just full of cheese at an authentic Mexican restaurant, but this place was great! It had tons of options, and the food was very tasty!   The restaurant itself is pretty casual, nothing fancy at all -- pretty typical of most authentic restaurants. We were served Chips, Salsa and this AWESOME bean dip when we got there. The salsa had a nice kick to it too! My Co-worker ordered a margarita that tasted excellent, and I had a glass of Sangria, which was also decent.   Both of us being huge fans of Guac, we had to order the Guacamole. Our server brought out all of the ingredients, from the whole avocado, to the lime and cilantro, and made the Guacamole right in front us! It doesn't get any fresher than that! He even asked as us how spicy we like it, so he could cut the right amount of jalapeno for us.   For dinner, I ordered a vegetarian enchilada and a taco. The enchilada was full of fresh veggies, so it wasn't so cheesy, which was really nice. The meal also came with beans and rice, so you get really good amount for the price.   If you're in Vegas, you can't leave without coming here!!",

The steak in the fajita burrito was perfectly cooked and seasoned, and my parents' chile relleno was the best I've ever had. If you are looking for good food away from the strip this is it!",

After 30 mins, we inquired and we were told it was just a little bit more of a wait....\"a little bit\" turned out to be an hour and 10 mins... When we inquired with the girl at the door, she couldn't even remember our names, who we were..etc.. so much for having reservations!  Left... hungry and upset....",

The exterior of the building at this location just looks like almost any other building. But once you walk inside you can see the love put into the decorations throughout the interior. I have been to many Mexican restaurants that go way overboard with decorations to look authentic and just look like stereotypical.  From the moment my wife and I walked in we well taken care of. We were seated quickly. Beverages were brought quickly. And we never lacked for a quick refill of our drinks. Our waiter was very friendly and answered all of our questions. This is some of the best service we have received at not just any restaurant but anywhere.  Go to any Mexican Restaurant and you will find the menu loaded with Tacos, Burritos, Nachos, Enchiladas, and Taco Salads. Lindo Michoacan has some of these on the menu, but they are a very small portion. Some of the items on the menu are Pollo al Mojo de Ajo, Chili Verde and Colorado, Camarones Rancheros and much more. My wife and I ended up ordering the same item. We both got a Chili Lime Chicken. This came with a side of beans and rice and also came with flour or corn tortillas made on site. They came out fresh and hot. They were full of flavor and complemented the rest of the meal. The chicken was flavorful as well and had the right amount of tang with the lime squeeze. So there is Mexican food and truly authentic Mexican Food. This is the real deal and now my favorite Mexican Restaurant.",

Head over to Mandalay Bay and get some decent food at the Border's Grill.",

Everything is excellent - The food, the service, the decor, the drinks, you name it! I ordered the Birria de Chivo which was absolutely delicious.

The house salsa is awesome, it may be a little too hot for some but very addicting! They also bring out some bean dip as well.   I have had several different items on the menu from the Burritos, the tostada and the carne asada - which are all were leaving you to want more!!  The bar drinks are great as well and a very strong!

No asking if we like our meal plates sat in the back too long. Can't get drinks refilled and shame on the manager as well bc no way should you have allowed this to happen when you're constantly walking past our booth. Won't come ever again.

But beware! Do no fill up on the chips, because the entrees are superb. Among my favorite is the chicken saranadeado which has just a bit of spice and explosive flavor. I pair mine with the flour tortillas which are freshly made at the restaurant. The guacamole is also exceptional and made to order by the waiter at your table. Another favorite of mine is the al mojo de ajo with shrimp. Even the basics of a couple beef tacos or enchiladas are done to a very high level. Regardless of what you order give Lindo a try you will be glad you did.",

Although they didn't have the vegan tamales,  they do have a vegetarian section that can easily be made vegan.  I had the vegetable enchiladas with the green sauce topped with avocado instead of cheese. Very filling,  I took half of it home. Also unlimited chips and beans. We ordered guacamole,  which they make fresh at your table. It was very good.  I also ordered a mango mojito which was very tasty.  Overall this is a nice place where anyone can eat. The view is really great too so make sure to get a seat by a window so you can gaze on the strip as you eat",

My boyfriend and I sat there nearly the entire time being completely unacknowledged and if he hadn't said anything I think we would have been sitting there even longer. We had asked for a refill on salsa but the guy took it and must have forgotten. He never brought it. Normally that wouldn't be that big of a deal but we got our food and nobody asked how it was once or paid any attention to us. The entire time we were there. I saw other people being attended to constantly and I felt like it was rude that we were ignored the whole time and other people were getting 5 star service. We were done eating and were wanting dessert but nobody asked us until my boyfriend caught the guy's attention. We ate the dessert and then were obviously done and were wanting the check but again, nobody came to check in with us. Almost 20 minutes went by (this was the third time we were waiting for someone to just look at us) and my boyfriend stood up for about 5 minutes trying to get someone's attention and again was completely ignored. He ended up going over to the manager asking for the check. I don't know if they were biased toward us since we looked young but we always tip well when going out to eat and would have tipped a lot more if someone had paid attention to us. I felt very unwelcome and don't want to go back. I would give zero stars but the food was good. I don't think either of us deserved that and it was the worst service I've ever had and we eat out a lot. We left the restaurant and the hostess didn't look at us or say anything. I am a little upset over it.",

This is the second restaurant that has had this strange tasting salsa.  The salsa is what kills it for me.  I need salsa on my mexican food and this salsa ruined the food.

We made the mistake of going on a Saturday afternoon at 5:30. And although the wait for us was only 20 minutes, the people behind us were just being seated when we had finished our meal. And there was a line of dozens of folks wait  Aside from the excellent selection, delicious food, and charming ambiance, the service was outstanding! Each person from Luis, the manager, Jorge the busser, and the other service staff, they all worked as a TEAM!  As soon as our water was empty, somebody filled it. As soon as a table was empty another platoon of staff came in to clean it and prepare it for the next guest.  Back to the food, my wife had the empinadas and I had the carnitas. Our meals were served quickly. They were hot and fresh. The tortillas were right off the stove and too hot to handle! There was a homemade freshness to everything.   Make your reservation, load up the family and head over to Lindo Michoacan! You will not be disappointed!",

We came during lunch, expecting a long wait but we were seated super quick. I looked over the menu and Freddy brought out chips, beans, and salsa. I added salt to the beans and skimmed the menu. I checked out the lunch menu, because how can you pass up an entree and a drink for a set price?!  Out came the fideo and I ordered a deconstructed chimichanga with carne asada. Now, this was my first chimichanga and boy was it delicious! The exterior was crispy and delicious and the inside was busting the seams with carne asada. On the side was my beans and rice and some guac with lettuce. Freddy recommended I get some enchilada sauce to put on top or dip. BOMB.  The chips and salsa were also yummy, and the ambiance is so fun and nice!   Go with their lunch menu deals, you will not be sorry!",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I were looking for a great Mexican restaurant so I searched the internet and read reviews and this place was on almost every list of great authentic Mexican restaurants. I got the steak and lobster and he got the carne asada nachos.  My meal was $39.95 and worth every penny. We had to wait quiet a while for our food but to me it was well worth it. My lobster and steak were absolutely perfect. The  steak was huge and I had some left to take home (for a nice breakfast of steak and eggs tomorrow). It was cooked exactly as I ordered it, rare. The texture of the lobster was spot on and it was delicious in the garlic sauce. I also had a peach margarita that was great.  My boyfriend was not as pleased with his nachos. The steak on the nachos was way overdone and rubbery.  The staff were friendly and seemed to work well as a team.  Just be aware, unlike a lot of places where the chips and salsa are all complimentary, here only the first serving is complimentary. After that you have to pay.  I had a wonderful experience and would definitely come back. My boyfriend would probably be willing to come back but he would definitely order something other than the carne asada nachos.",

The ambiance is lively and festive, the wait staff are very attentive, and most importantly the food is ALWAYS GREAT! When I have guests in town, and they want Mexican food, I come here, bingo, every time. The atmosphere is so lively and often times loud, which I suppose if you're out for a quiet date night, you make the call. I personally love the lively atmosphere. I've tried something new-to-me each time I've came, and was satisfied each time. Most recently I had the Enchiladas de Suiza, which was pretty darn tasty. I really liked the sauce, which was a family recipe. I always order sopapillas for dessert, and they are served up as a plate of 4 delightful little pillows of yum. There's a reason this place is consistently on the \"best of Las Vegas\" list, it is well worth visiting for a delightful authentic and festive Mexican dinner! Highly recommend and definitely come back",

The Service was a little slow but it was worth the wait because the food is great and they give you chop & salsa, also refried beans to hold you over till your food comes out . We ordered the carnitas and steak plates, the carnitas where some of the best I've ever had crispy just right and not overly dry and not to moist and the flavor was really good, I still got those carnitas on my mind, the steak was good to but the carnitas are on point you got to try those carnitas here. I plate run about $19.00  but it worth it. The inside and outside of this place is Decorated real nice make sure you take a look around at all the Mexican art work.",

Thanks to yelp, we have found another family favorite. The menu is enormous and some of the items I've never even heard of, but you can't go wrong with their famous carnitas.

The decor is very colorful, they had a mariachi band making rounds in the restaurant and waiters busily making table side guacamole.   Spreading of table side guacamole, order it! And the ceviche - it was fantastic. They also bring chips & salsa for the table along with a side of retried beans. At this point, I'm usually full, but we pressed forward. I ordered the chile verde. It had great flavor.   Against better judgement, we ordered dessert. Two. The fried ice cream was fantastic! It was quickly devoured.

Our friend recommended (actually persistantly insisted that we must go here multiple times throughout the day). My first thought was, why we choosing this place over a vegas buffet we got good Mexican back home. Y desculpe because damnit that was wrong of me to say! Now I will never not come here when I visit! Todo la comida esta tan riquisimo. In other words you want authentic Mexican food that your Nana makes and after a night of drinking and takes care of you like your sick and not just tan crudo/a (hungover af). COME HERE! The whole experience just brought me back to life. First off, as you are seated you get fresh chip and salsa and also frijoles! Next we place our orders from a FULL list of great items to choose from. There menu made it difficult to decide but I went with the Chile Relleno and cheese Enchilada with Rice and Beans everyone else got something different so we (...ok pues I mean \"I\") can taste a little bit of everything. Once everyone had ordered the waiter came out with a little cup of fideo soup. My eyes lit up like no other. My friend decided to order some guacamole for the table. They prepared it fresh at our table. It was DAMN GOOD! Anyways our food came out so fast and we had a large party of 10. I feel like that is unheard of sometimes with restaurants. And oh my God..these plates had un chingon de comida beautifully laid out on each plate. Are you hooked on this place yet or should I keep going haha! You must try it out yourself. If you have a large party (like we did) be sure to call in advanced to be seated there is a wait but these people know what their doing and get you seated in a timely manner. The staff and incredible friendly and ready to serve you. So show your servers some love because they're about to treat you like family. See you soon - I will be back!!",

What made the experience exceptional for my family, however, was the service.   From the greeting at the door, to the waiter, to the support staff refilling water, etc. (Jose in particular), we felt like we'd been invited to someone's home and they just wanted us to have a great time. I'm telling you, it was like the Chick-fil-a of Mexican restaurants!  I had the carnitas and thoroughly enjoyed them. Don't sleep on the avacado salsa...it was outstanding!  I'm a pretty good size guy and can eat, and I couldn't take the whole thing down.   Bottom line:  Great food, service and family atmosphere. I highly recommend you give them a try!",

Not to mention the price ... it was $30 for three tacos a drink and a flan to go.   I'm sorry but I'll take my money elsewhere.  Old school place, with basically mex/American food.",

Jose \"chino\", Daniel, and the manager were so busy but still very attentive to serving all our needs. A party of 6 and they were keen on recognizing what we might need before we even made requests. I was indecisive as to what to eat, but Daniel recommended \"el platillo de plata\", if my memory serves me right, but it was amazingly delicious this plate could honestly feed two people. It was a beef, chicken, and shrimp plate that was to die for. I must also mention the live music that was playing during our stay that was icing on the cake because they played great hits. From beginning to end it was a delightful experience. Thank you Lindo Michoacan!",

They were decent, but I've had better. They did however put grilled tomatoes in with the meat, peppers and onions, which I liked. They also have amazing fresh flour tortillas that really helped bring up the flavor in the fajita.   If only I wasn't driving, I would have been able to rate the margaritas for you too.

Coming from southern California we have pretty high standards when it comes to Mexican food. Lindo Michoacan did not disappoint! Some of the best Mexican, if not the best Mexican food I have tried in Las Vegas! I made reservation for Saturday night at 7 pm. And when my family and I arrived the place was packed! As we waited for our table there was a live mariachi band for entertainment. We did not have to wait long to be seated, where our drink order was taken and chips salsa and, bean dip were placed on the table as an appetizer. Yum! Salsa was delicious and had a bit of heat and great chili flavor. The bean dip was my favorite, like I said you know a Mexican place is good if they make good beans! The chips were delicious as well and obviously homemade. Service was friendly and prompt, even in the midst of a rush hour. I ordered a bean and cheese burrito wet, it was a generous portion and was very delicious. The wet sauce was tomato based which was delicious, however next time I will request the diablo sauce, which is more of an enchilada type sauce. My whole family enjoyed their dinner plates and all of the food looked delicious to me. I can't wait to try more on the menu!",

    "text": "Went here for dinner on friends recommendation and it did not disappoint.  We typically stay on the strip so this was quite a venture out for us.  I believe that there is a closer one to the strip...but we had to check out the \"original\" one. We came on a friday night at 6:30pm and found it starting to fill up. Location/Ambience:  About 15mins from the strip.  Easy to find and plenty of parking in the back.  The vibe was chill.  Decorated in traditional mexican decor.  Restrooms were clean.  They would arrange tables to fit group size. Service:  This was the best service at a Mexican restaurant that I have ever received.  we were greeted and shown to a table right away.  As soon as we sat down, chips/salsa/beans (yes beans) were placed in front of us.  Multiple people would stop by and ask if everything was ok.  Great recommendations.  Loved the fact that there was a lady making fresh tortillas in the corner.  Food came out at a decent pace.  Drinks came out super fast.   Food:  The menu was definitely extensive.  Nicely organized by proteins.  LOts of things I wanted to try.  I loved the chips/salsa/beans.  NOt terribly spicy but got a nice heat to the salsa.  I opted fro the Buey Al Cilantro (on server recommendation).  I have never ordered a steak (rib eye) from a mexican restaurant, but this turned out to be fantastic.  IT was cooked perfectly medium.  But what made it awesome was the cilantro/onion/chile verde sauce.  It was really really good.  I would cut a strip, add some beans/rice, and eat it with their tortilla.  I'm still thinking about that dish.  Great value at $20 too.  My wife got a seafood soup and that had some nice flavor as well.  The mango margarita was a tad too sweet.  But the original one was great.   I would definitely recommend this place.  I would love to return and try out the other items.",

I appreciate how we could request the spicy level.   Not knowing many authentic Mexican dishes, I ordered chicken fajita. I was kind of bummed because I generally don't like fajitas, but I was wrong! This fajita was the best I ever had, and I'm so glad I got it! The chicken was so good that I could eat it by itself. The meal came with rice, refried beans, sour cream and guacamole. The tortillas are also made fresh. All perfect with my meal. Big enough to feed two small ladies like myself; in retrospect, I should have shared it.  I forgot what the dessert we ordered was called, but it was basically vanilla ice cream covered in crunchy flakes, caramel, and cinnamon. It was covered in rum and then lit on fire in ordered for it to caramelize. Very strong rum flavor, so don't get it if you don't like alcohol.   If I ever come back to Vegas, I definitely will come back here. Highly recommended!",

Sometimes it's off the hook and other times is so very disappointing  if you come in after 8 pm food is totally inconsistent-- carne asada tacos came out as if meat was boiled grey looking horrible. The time before early evening it was amazing dark, caramelized the way it should be. Another time rice was so hard and crusted!! They should be ashamed to serve that--if too late to make more then offer fries something else instead of serving a staple --Mexican  rice that old and dry. I just don't understand why so inconsistent??? For as many years as they've been voted  \"The Best\" it makes no sense. Also if you dine late night expect to eat in silence  after 10 not even overhead music, even if customers are still arriving as they advertise open till midnight.",

My Cousin was visiting from out of town and we went here on a Friday for lunch. The parking lot was very full so I was worried there would be a long wait. We were greeted at the door and immediately seated. We were given chips, salsa and bean dip right away. They were nice and fresh. Our drink orders were taken and delivered and our food came out really fast! I had the lunch enchilada special. It was very tasty. The service and food were excellent! I will definitely come back!",

It was comfortable, our servers were really nice and the food was quick! And not in a bad way. We ordered a beer and a margarita and they were both good.

In the middle room you can even see the tortillas being freshly made.  The only thing that was bad about my second trip was the fact that for the life of me I couldn't remember what I got the first time to order it again...but my second meal was excellent as well.  The guac is made table side and is super fresh.  I love making homemade guac myself and actually will not make it without cilantro anymore because they used it at Lindo and it really made a difference.  We live a good 6 miles or so away and on the way everyone was asking why we were traveling so far for this restaurant and if we were getting Mexican food, why we couldn't go to one of the one hundred places that are closer.  By the end of the meal everyone need why and gave me kudos for the selection.  It will be hard to go anywhere else when I have a craving for Mexican food.",

    "text": "So after making the choice of tying the knot in Vegas during Labor Day weekend 2016, we needed a place to have the dinner afterwards. First choice was a Buffet, but after calling so many locations and all of them saying it would have to be paid in advance and then no refund if someone did not show up there was no refund. Tried calling some restaurants serving american food, and they wanted a deposit and give a special menu, I was stressing out trying to find a location that would accommodate about 20 people. The thing about my party is that most of them are Japanese since my now wife is Japanese, so trying to accommodate every one with food choices. But come remember that they all love Mexican food. So I found this place on yelp and called to see what they could do for me. To my surprise, no special menu, no deposit and every one got there on check. But the best part was when we show up and they ask for me and my wife to go in last. They sat all our guest, and then let us in. As we came in they had the mariachi playing for us! Best entrance ever. I have to give it to this place the atmosphere was great and the food was AWESOME! The waiters were very attentive to all our needs, they were awesome! Everyone in my party was satisfied with their food. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone stopping by Vegas. Sorry to Original Lindo Michoacan for the late review.",

    "text": "We loved the design and decor of this Mexican restaurant and we had high hopes based on the reviews and buzz. We arrived at 4:50pm on a Friday which turned out to be 10 minutes before happy hour ended. The restaurant was already getting busy, and our server scrambled to make sure we got our drinks at the happy hour half-price which we appreciated very much - $5.00 for Javier's Margarita and $2.75 for an ice-cold pint of draft Pacifico. These happy hour drink prices alone make OLM one of the best values in Las Vegas, and as we perused the fantastic menu with many dishes we had never seen or heard of before it looked like we were heading into an easy 5-star experience. The food, unfortunately, changed all that.  When we were seated we were served fresh tortilla chips, warm bean dip, and pinkish salsa that had a bit of a bite. I thought all were great but my GF thought the salsa tasted odd and \"off\" somehow.   For the past several days we had been doing a Queso Fundido with chorizo tour around Las Vegas, trying this dish at a variety of area Mexican restaurants, and we were looking forward to trying OLM's version. OLM charges $8.50 for plain Queso Fundido and you can add chorizo for $1.00 more. We ordered this and when it arrived we could see no chorizo in the dish. We poked around in it and it turned out they had put a tiny amount (perhaps a bit less than a teaspoon) of chorizo underneath the top layer of cheese. The tiny crumbles of chorizo we were able to locate were barely enough to taste, but when we did get a taste it was very good. To the management of Original Lindo Michoacan: we would gladly have paid an extra $2.50 for a decent amount of chorizo in your Queso Fundido. This is typically what your competitors charge for a more generous amount, and by charging only $1.00 for this and then appearing to skimp on it and not really deliver it to your customers you are shooting yourselves in the foot.  After drinks, chips, and queso we were getting full and we really had no room left for a huge plate of food. So we ordered a single, a la carte Al Pastor taco in order to see how well OLM does with Al Pastor which is another one of our Mexican favorites. We have had some absolutely spectacular Al Pastor in Las Vegas at many restaurants and taco shops, and again we were looking forward to tasting OLM's version.  The taco arrived and it was pathetic. It was really just little nuggets of gristly pork fat with virtually no Al Pastor flavor or color at all. Ugh. We were left wondering how a restaurant with the reputation and following that OLM has could fail so badly with this Mexican staple. Oh well.   Original Lindo Michoacan gets 3.5 stars for our first visit. They had everything in place for an easy 5 stars but the kitchen made sure that didn't happen. We are willing to return once more during happy hour to give their kitchen another chance by trying some other items on their really interesting menu, and to again enjoy some of their well-priced drinks. However, we now realize that Original Lindo Michoacan may emerge as the best choice for happy hour drinks only, and at 5:00pm we'll need to move on to another place for some Mexican food.",

AWESOME customer service!    Every time I called the restaurant to coordinate or ask questions about our upcoming dinner, they were super friendly and appeasing!  They had no problem letting me bring in a cake and actually let me drop it off the evening before to keep in their refrigerator (sneaking in the back door so I didn't have to get caught up in the huge line upfront)!   It was just a wonderful experience - the staff was fun, polite and very attentive!    The food was great -  I wasn't the biggest fan of what I had ordered (Gallo al Mojo de Ajo - just wasn't my cup of tea) but ended up nibbling off of my mom's burrito (and taking the rest back to my hotel) and it was AMAZING!    The best part of the night was when they came out to sing Happy Birthday to my mom, aunt and great uncle (who turned 80!).  They must have had pretty much the whole staff come out to sing with surprise tequila shots!  I had read some of the reviews before and so I knew it was going to happen, but totally blanked until moments before!  I just wished I had grabbed my phone to record it because it was HILARIOUS!!!    Thank you for such a wonderful time and thank you for the awesome customer service!!!",

They have a hand-made tortilla stand with ladies constantly making fresh tortillas. If you order guacamole, it gets hand made to order right at your table. Also, when you are seated, they bring fresh refried bean dip, salsa, chips and Mexican noodle soup (sopa de fideo). Very nice touch by the way!

    "text": "It actually breaks my heart to write this review. Any other time I have been here I've always received excellent service and the food has been awesome....until yesterday... My boyfriend both worked  half days yesterday so we decided to meet at Lindo for lunch. We sat at the bar because it was lunchtime so obviously we knew it was going to be packed. The bartender was really nice and served us right away...then it all went downhill. My boyfriend order the chicken crema y rajas, i ordered shrimp mojo de ajo. When the food came out, mine was chicken instead of shrimp so I sent it back and the bartender apologized. It was fine I had time to kill anyway. Boy oh boy... As the server put the plate down, all the juice spilled all over my dress!!!!!  It was HOT!! But sh.. Happens!! When I looked at WHAT was on my plate .....it was the poorest excuse of ajo I have ever seen in my life!!!! Very watery, no garlic, it tasted like lemon water with a bit of tomato!!! I know this dish well since I order it all the time. At this point i start getting mad!!! The bartender said she was going to get the manager which we waited and waited and waited and waited but she was too busy getting chips for the five gentlemen that were seated at the bar next to us. Being a manager you might want to take care of the serious problem at the end other end of the bar first just saying.... At this point I am soaked in shrimp, tomato lemon water. My dress is ruined..and Im still hungry. My boyfriends appetite was ruined so he just boxed his up. All I got was an apology and the shrimp removed from the bill. This was THE worst dining experience I ever had. Its sad that it had to happen here. The manager should have done more on her part to rectify the situation. Not everyone in management deserves the title.   And p.s.... I never got my soup either. :(",

I have to say, everything was absolutely perfect, from my add-ons to my deletions (with a tiny absence of my Ranchero sauce ) Steak cooked perfectly, the chips, salsa and frijoles you get complementary when you come in were all included, plus the extra salsa requested, an abundance of fresh, hot tortilla chips, fideo, guacamole, corn and flour tortillas, etc. My bag must've weighed several pounds! Being a Dallas transplant, good Tex-Mex was a challenge to find here. But this place is definitely a gem!",

I could tell it was going to be a delicious dinner when the chips and salsa came out.  Also, the bean dip served with the chips was wonderful.  Not sure if this is a local thing, but bean dip is not typically served automatically at our Mexican restaurants.  We also ordered guacamole and the shrimp ceviche, and after the appetizers I was so full I could have skipped dinner.  But I didn't.  I had the carnitas coca cola, which was a nice twist on a pork entree.  The marinade was just slightly sweeter than I prefer, but it was very good.  Entree portions are huge - my boyfriend and I wished we had split because neither of us finished our dinners.  Friends ordered the goat stew, steak with green chiles and another order of the carnitas specialty and everyone loved their meals.  We filled the table with food and drinks, everyone left full and the best part of all was the total for the meal was about half what we spent on other dinners in Las Vegas.  We didn't know about the free shuttle to and from the Strip, so we came in a cab and then used the shuttle to go back to our hotel.  What a great bonus to an already wonderful meal!",

I read so many positive reviews about this place that I thought I would give them a try.  I don't know what you people consider \"authentic\" Mexican food, but this isn't it.   The decor was very nice, I really loved the inside of the restaurant.  The staff were all very friendly as well.  The salsa was not good at all.  It wasn't spicy enough and was actually kind of bland.  The fideo soup was new to me, I've never seen that before in a restaurant and it was alright.  I ordered a beef taco, beef enchilada and chile relleno plate.  They used the same green sauce on both the beef enchilada and chile relleno.  The sauce tasted like it was from a can.  And unless everyone else has it wrong, I've never heard of green sauce on a beef item.  I do not recommend this place, nor will I eat here again.  It is kind of sad too because as I said,  the decor and service were excellent.",

We were promptly seated and a few minutes later, complimentary chips and salsa were delivered to the table, what a nice surprise! Me and my friend ate about 12 tacos in total, 6 each with different types of meat.  Food came out pretty quickly and looked delicious. Almost forgot to take a picture for the gram! They tasted pretty bomb. It seemed like every taco was made perfectly: the Asada was perfectly seasoned and charred, the al pastor was juicy and smothered in sauce, and the BBQ beef and beef tongue were equally delicious. Only downside was that they didn't have a salsa bar with jalapenos or extra onions/cilantro, but they seriously pack the meat in those tacos so it wasn't really necessary anyway. They also make their own tortillas so they had the perfect texture.   Service was wonderful as the waitress was super genuine and nice!   Will DEFINITELY be back!",

Here you will find homemade taco shells fresh out of the fryer and a nicely textured masa on the tamale.  Meat was sliced or shredded, not minced.  Guacamole made table side to your specifications.  Food is spicy without being overbearing and there is more to the flavor to the profile than jalapeno.  In fact, if I can handle it most people would say it's not \"hot\" enough for Mexican cuisine but I would suggest this is more authentic than what you find in many \"Mexican\" restaurants.  The only thing I wasn't over the moon with was the cheese enchilada which was good but a little on the oily side.  Really, it's hard not to get a cheese enchilada without a ton of oil on it anywhere.  Beyond that, the place is very clean and brightly decorated. It was large with plenty of room for large parties, very family friendly. Wait staff are extremely courteous and quick without being intrusive even during peak lunch hour when the place was really hopping.  Glasses never got empty, chip bowl never got empty of homemade tortilla chips.  Food came out quickly and hot.  Lunch for two with appetizer and teas $45 before tip and we left a lot of food behind because we weren't headed back to a place we could keep it cool.  If you are a lighter eater, consider sharing a plate, even at lunch.",

We got a fabulous booth by the homemade tortilla station and were immediately brought yummy chips, bean dip and (spicy!) salsa. We were also brought cups of soup - a totally unexpected treat that our kids devoured!   Kid review:  We ordered the kids some homemade tortillas (which they did NOT share with us) and the kids menu chicken-which were like thin filets fried, yet like roasted chicken-they LOVED it! Their lemonade apparently were a HUGE hit, as well! This is now our kids number 1 favorite restaurant of all!!! I wished I'd written down all the compliments they kept blurting out throughout their meals!   Adult review:  My husband and I couldn't resist splitting two entrees- enchiladas-one Mole sauce and one Green sauce (starts with an \"A\") with diced onions on top-yum!!! I must say that I don't usually like rice but the serving size was so cute and small it made the \"dish\" as a whole, very appealing!   And ...omg...the coconut Margarita (blended!) with fresh grated coconut sprinkled on top.....yuuuuuuuuuuuum!!!!!!   Husband's highlights: Blue Cadillac Margarita tasted crisp and strong and the chip in the entree was like a sinfully delicious chimichanga!",

Granted my family comes from Michoacan and perhaps that's why everything tastes like home.  1. They start you off which chips, salsa and home made refried beans. None of that canned stuff! (Yes I know the difference)  2. Your meal comes with a traditional \"sopa de fideo\" which is what every Mexican kid grows up with as a child. It's like a alphabet soup but with some Latino TLC  3. The flour and corn tortillas are home made!!! How often do you see that???!!! Makes the food so much better!!  4. The restaurant has beautiful decorations of typical arts from Michoacan. Everything on the walls are representative of what a Pueblo in Michoacan sells as hand made art.  5. They have live music. There is a one man band gentlemen with his guitar or keyboard that plays great songs. You can tip him and give requests. They even let us dance to one of his songs. Not much room but we made room.  6. Pretty much anything you order is freshly made and damn good at a reasonable price! To the owners of Lindo Michoacan, you should consider opening up one in Orange County, Ca. PLEASE!!!",

They give complimentary chips, salsa, and this amazing tomato based soup with the thinnest noodles in it! Yum! I recommend sharing a dish or come hungry!!!!  I had the beef ranchero salad. Nice portion of meat. A nice kick of spice of the dressing. Lovely salad!   My friend got a combo meal. WoW. Huge serving. Three people can eat it!  Now lets talk about the guac!!! The avocado is sliced in front of you. Garnish with lime and all the seasoning. The server will also ask how spicy you want it by the amount of jalapeno he will put in the mixer! Very entertaining to watch!!!  Around the restarurant, there are people celebrating bdays and staff are so festive doing their rounds singing to them! Bday tequilla shots too!!!  So fun! Festive. I cant wait to visit when I am in town!",

    "text": "We were visiting Las Vegas and had a rental car for a few days, so we decided to have dinner somewhere off The Strip. We did a Yelp search for best Mexican restaurants and found Lindo Michoacan. I am so glad we did because it was a most delightful dinning experience.   We arrived for a relatively early dinner on a Monday and were seated immediately. The space is enormous and they also have a nice bar (which I did not visit), so even if there was a wait, I can't imagine it would be long.   We were seated at an intimate semi-circle booth. I was quickly drawn to the authentic vibe of the space - great decor and great music. Within seconds we were greeted by our waiter, who informed us about the happy hour specials. Who can say no to a margarita, especially with the happy price? Next, another staff member delivered us warm chips, salsa, and a dip (similar to refried beans). I was a fan of all three and I typically do not care for refried beans.   When I started to explore the menu, I was a bit overwhelmed. Think Cheesecake Factory. It was organized nicely into pork, chicken, beef, seafood, and combination options (enchiladas, tacos, burritos, etc). Based on comfort, I was tempted to go to the combo page and order something about which I am familiar, but I thought maybe this wasn't the best idea since it was the last page of the menu - almost an afterthought. Therefore, I enlisted the assistance of the waiter. I asked for his advice on the best camarones (shrimp) dishes. He recommended three and I decided on the Camarones Rajas Crema.   While we were ordering, someone sneak attack delivered complimentary sopa de Fideo; tasty broth with thin, short noodles. Definitely a nice start to the meal. And I am completely serious when I say I did not even see it be placed in front of me.   It didn't take long for our entrees to arrive. The Camarones Rajas Crema was visually appealing and tasted even better. There were 6-7 large shrimp, perfectly complimented with poblano peppers and onions, in a red cream sauce served with refried beans, rice, guacamole, and lettuce. The shrimp were clearly fresh and substantial in size. We had our choice of flour and corn tortillas and we decided to try both. While both were delicious, I preferred the corn.   Along with amazing food and the inviting ambiance, the service was impeccable. Everyone with whom we interacted was friendly, attentive, and dedicated to excellence.   Regarding tourists, while one could probably eat three meals a day on The Strip for a year and never eat at the same place twice, this place is worth getting off The Strip. Make the short trip, you won't regret it! Did I mention the prices were reasonable.",

Most of us ordered the menudo and i have to say, it's some if the best menudo ive had. The horchata was delicious too. Everyone gets fideo to start, you don't even have to order it. It was really good, it reminded me of the fideo my nanas used to make.  Highly recommend coming here.",

    "text": "Worse service. We came based upon recommendations. I got the garlic shrimp and my bf got the fajita plate. We got a ceviche to share. The shrimp and bean dip was good, but everything went downhill from there. Two separate waiters came to help out. Both taking drink orders, failed to bring the drinks, then asked again for our order. Fast forward, my bf went to the bathroom so we thought, perfect, it's the perfect time to tell our waiter it's his birthday. Bout an hour passed, our ceviche finally arrived. It looks really boring. Sure enough, my suspicions were right. The lime juice was bitter(bad lime). The rest of the food finally followed after another 15 minutes. My shrimp plate tasted funky. The waiter forgot my sourcream and I was charged for it. My bf's fajita plate only had chicken when he ordered chicken and steak. The plate was filled with green bell peppers and onions. The chicken was plain. Our friends got their plates and ate quietly because they were so hungry and tired. Their ceviche tasted a lot better than ours and we got the same thing. It took forever to ask for limes and the waiter kept forgetting to bring our bill. We noticed they charged extra for things that they did not bring out. We told the waiter so he can make the changes. They forgot to sing happy birthday so we had to remind them. They came out and did the whole birthday thing with the free tequila shot. Overall, it could have been better, but the service and food was not cutting it. Waste of money!",

    "text": "\" This Place Was Packed At 10:00 pm \"  I went to the Lindo Michoacan Mexican Restaurant in Las Vegas Nevada and was blown away ! First of all from the outside of the restaurant at night it looks like a very small place. But do not let that fool you. The restaurant has 5 huge areas where customers can enjoy great food, and music, along with nice drinks and cocktails with also have a very friendly staff. They have an outstanding Mexican Mariachi Band called the Tierra Bravia,  that walks around playing some great Mexican music for the customers to enjoy. And at 10:00 pm at night, every table was packed in this restaurant, and customers were still waiting for tables.The restaurant is very nicely decorated with Mexican items all over the walls. Dustin the Lindo Michoacan manager was very nice as he sat us at a table. Jonathan our server was also very pleasant to talk with, as he answered all of our questions about the menu items, as he hand made some fresh and tasty Guacomole for our table. They also serve you before your meal with tortilla chips, spicy and delicious read salsa, and 2 bowls of different bean Dips. Lindo Michoacan has a Gourmet Mexican Cuisine Menu with Mexican food tasting like you are really in Mexico. We tried several items including Milanesa Breaded Steak Sandwich with French Fries and Jalapenos. A Cheese Chili Relleno and Beef Taco, served with Rice Beans and Fideo Soup. We also enjoy some Tamarindo, Horchata, and Jamaica Mexican drinks with our meals. All of the food and drinks were AWESOME ! If you are in Las Vegas check them out, you will not be disappointed !",

We'll start it up with the service, we order sopes as an appetizer as soon as we're seated and the lag begins. We remind the waiter, and he comes back sets up the \"appetizer plates\" and says \"they're on their way\". Twenty minutes roll through and instead our entrees come out, still no sign of sopes. So I figure no big deal, they're just under staffed, and started digging into my chewy chile colorado, which was an instant bust, it taste like processed canned beef and sauce was bland, lacking herbs and spices, thankfully the beans and tortillas were good. My daughter's tacos had burnt popcorn picadillo beef that had been reheated with out a doubt and my wife's shrimp were weird tasting but the cream sauce was tasty.  Midway through our meal our cold sopes show up, so I swap out my canned cubed beef chile Colorado and bite into a stale sope with their signature reheated burnt picadillo beef, drop it, I pick up their chorizo and the same disappointment, grabbed a fork and picked at the chicken and we tap out.  Our waiter comes by so we tell him the sopes were no good and cold and takes them away, 10 minutes later the short manager with glasses and a arrogant personality shows up frustrated, asking who had a complaint about the sopes that had been picked and played with? Big middle finger to you my bitter friend hope your people skills improve. We weren't even asking for a refund, we just wanted friendly service and quality fresh food.  Keep the quality and lose the bad management Mi Lindo Michoacan",

Ordered ceviche and it was whatever, I was with other two friends, one of my friends is vegetarian, her meal was totally unsatisfying, just a rolled tortilla with zucchini and onions inside, my other friends enchiladas were also blah, with store bought enchilada sauce.

It's refreshing to eat at a Mexican restaurant that is not upscale, without gimmicks, and has tasty margaritas. They also have an extensive menu with all kinds of yummy-sounding options, although their veggie selection is pretty thin. For an appetizer, try to the nopalitos--grilled cactus with onions that you wrap up in their homemade tortillas--delicious! Plus nopalitos is so fun to say. Nopalitos! My enchiladas verdes were very satisfying, though not the best I've ever had. Still, I will make it a point to eat at Lindo Michoacan next time I visit Vegas, especially on that last day when being on the strip for another moment might make me choke the 200th girl I see with a tiny waist and balloon-like double D's.",

One of the thing I like about this place is when they sit you down they bring the tortilla chips; they make their own, with salsa and refried beans to complement that try their Fresh Guacamole Dip. They prepare the dip in front of you.  Another thing I like is they bring you sopa de fideo (Noodle soup); they make their own, before they bring your main entree. No other Mexican restaurant that I been to do that.  They also make flour or corn tortillas by hand. They have variety Mexican plates. The dishes have very good portion of food. They also have great desserts. When you come to this place read the history of Lindo Michoacan on their menu. Lindo Michoacan has interesting history. I highly recommended, check it out.

And the ice cream cost $6. So sad...",

The staff in cluding Carolina was friendly and knowledgeable and when they saw me whip out my video she gave me a guided tour. It was a Friday night and they had this great Mariachi Band and they were fabulous, even stopping at my table to serenade our group with some Tijuana Brass music. I decided to have their signature dessert, fried ice cream. Instead I got this wonderful flambe ball of crushed nuts surrounding delicious vanilla ice cream swathed in caramel. I am soooo satisfied. If you get to this place you won't be disappointed, but get there early because they pack up after 7. I'm still licking my fingers. Oh! Did I mention the two moms in the taquiera? They were making fresh tortillas for everyone all evening and smiling as they did it?",

Everything was fine until our entrees came. There was a block of rice that was uncooked hard and stuck together. I figured okay I can live with that. Started eating the fajitas. They were great until I got half way into the plate. As I looked down into my food I noticed a few pieces were very pink. I know there are people that like beef cooked there own way but I prefer mine to be well done which this obviously wasnt. Again, the only reason Im being somewhat nice about my rating was because our server was amazing. I didnt even bother with complaining cause he had been on top of everything and didnt want to ruin his night. We tipped him well of course because it wasnt his fault that the food came out the way it did.",

They have the best margaritas in town and you always get a complimentary cup of fideo, chips, Chile, and hot beans before your meal. The Buey al Cilantro is the best steak with the most delicious sauce ever! We keep coming back!!!! The kids love the fried ice cream. Every dish we have had here has been great from the steak and chicken to the shrimp menu. This is probably our 8th time here and it's no joke that we stop here every time we are in Vegas because we aren't locals. This place is a must if you want real, authentic Mexican food made fresh.",

I was waiting for a friend, and she was very accommodating.  Chips, salsa and been dip were brought out quickly. Salsa and bean dip are pretty good. I was mixing them together. I've had better table salsa, but I've also had much worse.  I ordered the fish tacos, and they were yummy. I went with fried fish, rather than the grilled, and they were very flavorful. I really liked that the sauce was served on the side... I love extra sauce and they gave me plenty.   I also ordered a beer, Tecate, with a salted glass.   FYI for Tecate lovers they have both cans and bottles.  The waiter was excellent to me, but a little salty to my friend (luckily I'm the one writing the review)  Overall excellent food, great beer (ask for a salted rim-so good), service evens out to pretty good... Mostly because my friend didn't mind the extra salt being thrown his way. I'm so glad this Las Vegas staple is so going strong.",

We heard the staff sang happy birthday to at least 4 groups while we were there--must be the place to go for bday celebrations!

It is simply a matter of finding employees who not only are good at providing good service but truly desire to give good service.   The saving grace.

On this most recent visit, I came with Groupon in hand and I have to say it made me a believer.  I ordered the Chuletas de Cerdo Estilo. These pork chops were perfection. The flavors were on point and they were cooked well. Many places overcook pork chops, but these were moist and flavorful. My fella ordered the two burrito combination plate. He chose the green chile pork with beans and a red chile beef burrito. The green chile burrito was addictive. The flavors were absolutely delightful. They danced in my mouth and made me eat quite a bit more than I should have. Next time I'm ordering this dish with both two green chile burritos instead of just the one.  The prices are reasonable considering what you get. I can't believe I've finally found a good Mexican restaurant in town by revisiting a place I had written off in the past! Service was friendly and beyond efficient. We never had a glass go half empty and our chips and dips were always filled to the brim.",

The service is great, considering we one of a couple of tables, this early, not too many people here.   I get my order in for a combination plate, I think it's called Patzcuaro, it included a chile relieno, one tamale, Green chicken enchilada and sour cream with onions.  The chips and salsa are very fresh, the chips are warm, the salsa and bean dip is very spicy.  And they offer a refill!  We get a small cup of soup, with noodle, hot but needs a little kick, so I add some of the salsa on the table.  The food comes out pipping hot and the cheese all melted the way I like it.  A very good meal.  The food is fresh, the service is great and they are open early.",

If I start reviewing each and everything we ordered this review will easily turn into a novel because I have nothing but great things to say about everything and no one will read it because its too long, so i'll just say go there and try it out yourself. You wont be disappointed. The food speaks for itself!",

I fell in love with the decor of this place too.   The only reason I did not give this place 5 stars was because our waiter was so sarcastic it wasn't even funny! We just had some questions because one of my friends is vegetarian and he was being rude. The bus boy on the other hand was more helpful at answering our questions.   A little ways off the strip but well worth the drive! The carnitas were finger licking good and I usually hate the beans at restaurants but I finished all of them. Oh and you can't beat the tasty handmade tortillas. I will defiantly come back next time I'm in Vegas.",

The margaritas are heavy pour which made me a tipsy, happy girl.   Few items we ordered: Carne Asada full of flavor and tender, chicken fajitas, table side guacamole, fresh tortillas, all very good. I will definitely be back with friends or family that prefer lively dinners.",

This place was packed at about 1:00PM on a Sunday...Families with huge tables...small tables etc.... I've got to admit they had the BEST DAMN Taquitos I've ever had in my life! Our server even gave me some Sopitos because I was asking about them.  The portions are pretty big...it's not your hole in the wall Mexican place where prices are cheap though....but definitely worth giving a whirl if you are looking for some good Mexican food in the area  Service was a bit slow but they were very apologetic even without us complaining....I'm not sure if soup is normally free but they gave us some soup as well. They give chips with salsa like most Mexican restaurants but also bean dip along with it.",

One person in our party enjoyed their steak entree, and it was very good but the chicken fajitas were bland, and the chile verde could have been better, they lacked flavor and heat terribly. The red salsa which they bring out had flavor and some heat to it, the green salsa did not.  We expected awesome Mexican food here based on reviews and awards but that wasn't the case with our visit.  Gone are the days of the old El Cholo Mexican Cafe on Las Vegas Blvd, and the killer food they used to serve consistently, it seems that nowadays Mexican food in Vegas is watered down, lacks the heat flavor and substance of the old ghosts of this town. I don't want a fusion of some pretentious looking spread when I go for Mexican food, I want flavor, heat, and authentic recipe's and Vegas just lacks that in the culinary genre.",

This place is great!   I've eaten here about 3 times. This last visit, I came with a group of 10 at 11pm after working the UNLV game. We chose to eat here because it was open late (until 12:15), has vegetarian options, and alcohol.   While waiting to order, they serve chips with salsa and beans! Our table devoured all of it! It was so good.  After, we were given fideo soup before our meal.   The entrees here are ginormous! I got el burrito bionoco, which is served with either chicken, pork, or beef, and rice, beans, lettuce, sour cream, pico, smothered with enchilada sauce and cheese. I ate 1/4 of it and took the rest home. For $11, it's a steal! Half of my party needed to-go boxes, so you know that's a lot of food.   They also had some kind of karaoke night when we were there. I couldn't see what was going on since it was on the other side of the restaurant, but you can here a crowd of people cheering on others to sing. It's pretty funny to listen to while you eat since the restaurant sounds so lively. The other times I've come, there is a mariachi band that goes to each table and plays a song for them.   This is definitely a place you want to try for good food and a great atmosphere.",

The food quality is good. They are very helpful to explain the menu items. I'm not from that region, so I always have questions! They don't mind making changes to the orders, if I'm asking for it. For example if I don't like something very spicy, they are willing to prepare the meal for me the way I like it! They make everything right! I love their Shrimp Fajitas. Very tasty! Love, love, love their homemade tortillas! Always fresh!!! My latest addiction is their Mango cake. So refreshing! Of course the Margarita is a must, especially with premium tequila!

We went for new years eve and ordered the steak and lobster...sigh. I was actually nervous ordering it from a mexican resturant but it was great. They can prepare it several different ways but we went with the waiter's favorite. Spicy and a new twist on a familar pairing made it reinvented completely. I have eaten there probably 100 times and if I can I will eat there 100 times more.",

Had friends that were getting married and looking for a place to eat for our group of 30+ people so I recommended the place.  Not only did they send a shuttle to pick up the wedding party but also seated us right away and gave us all superb service.  Drinks were constantly being refilled without asking and at the end of the night we were all dropped off near our hotels on the strip.  Food was excellent, service was excellent and overall it was a memorable experience!",

One particular thing I liked about this place was the Pollo llora hor, llora manana. It was the spiciest dish I have ever had! I loved this dish with the rest of the meal, but I did not care for the taste of the ghost chilis. They have kind of a burnt taste. However, mixed with the beans and rice this dish is delicious. Just be sure to keep a powerful antacid near by for afterwards! That chicken is no joke!",

This was by far the best mexican food we'd ever had. They bring out warm beans and a spicy salsa to start with. The salsa was a little hot for a couple of us so we asked if they had a mild. They brought out some Pico that was fantastic and a green salsa that was mild and just as fantastic! When we asked for an order of guacamole he came out with a table, bowls, and mixed it up right at the table! It was perfect! I highly suggest the carne asado tacos! Not only was the food here great so was the service. It is worth the short drive off the strip. This will be a must eat whenever we go back to Vegas. Do yourself a favor and go eat there, you wont be dissappointed.",

The menu prices have gone up so much. Lunch and dinner used to be a decent price, now they have gone up nearly 2 bucks for each entree. They also used to include a small bowl of soup with lunch, now it is 4.95 for it!!!! On top of all this, they provide only ONE refill of your beverage at lunch. So sad that the owners seem to have gotten very greedy and began to overprice. Despite this being one of my favorite Mexican resturants of all time, the price, quality and greed will not allow me to go back. I will look for something new.  You may never find another Mexican food resturant like this. WOW WOW WOW!!!!!  The food, awsome, the service, awsome, the price, awsome.  This family has done so well, and knows how to treat a customer!",

The service is always amazing, the food is sooooo good, and me and my family have been coming here for at least 10 years and we always pick this as our birthday dinner. When its your birthday they give you a free tequila shot and churros. I have only gotten the same thing every time I've been there which is gulf shrimp, wrapped in bacon and deep fried, holy heaven... And the sauce they give you to dip the shrimp is addictive, i dip everything in it, i would dip my shoe in there and it would be delicious. They give you this soup in the beginning with tiny noodles, and a chicken/tomato broth that's so awesome. And also the chips, salsa and bean dip they start you off with is so good, be careful or you'll get filled up before your food comes. All in all you never have to wait for your drink to be filled, great service and awesome food. Maybe a little expensive but worth it!",

I put off visiting for the longest time, but now that I've popped in a couple of times, I can agree that they are both consistent and fairly close to what I liked back home.  The menu is huge and a bit overwhelming. I find it best to go with a combo, all of them are enormous portions. The #5 is a favorite, with a cheese enchilada (that red sauce!) and a green chile pork burrito (wet style), AND a crispy chicken taco. It's a ton of food even before the requisite chips, salsa, and bean dip, plus a bowl of warm fideo soup, and sides of rice and beans. The prices are a bit high ($15-20 meal) but the portions are large enough to share- my guy and I usually add on a chile relleno ($5) if we're extra hungry.  The service is friendly and attentive. I love the traditional decor and server uniforms. This spot reminds me of Mi Tierra on the Riverwalk, but without the tamed-down flavors for the tourists or an on-site bakery. I find that I prefer dining in the bar area where I can get in and out quickly without waiting for a table- this spot gets pretty busy, even on weekdays.",

So we take turns and sometimes he'll have one and sometimes I'll have one.   Yesterday I had an epiphany...I thought about this place.  It's right beside my house...we could...walk there....and BOTH have a margarita. TOGETHER.  Genius!!! So that's what we did on Wednesday 9-14-16 at 6PM.   $71.75 got us two margaritas, a kids meal, two entrees, and an order of tableside guacamole.  You won't find a mexican restaurant with better ambiance than this one.  It's kinda dark inside, all the staff are dressed in traditional garbs, and the decorations are over-the-top-mexicanny.  Is that a word?   I never liked guacamole until I tried the tableside guac here.  They make it right in front of you (duh, tableside lol).  It is so fresh and chock full of tomatoes, jalapenos, lime juice, the avocados are perfectly ripe, and it's so nice and salty.  It's just the best guacamole ever!   I ordered the al pastor tacos because al pastor is fucking delicious and the menu said it came with 3 tacos topped with pineapple, cilantro, and onion, with rice and beans on the side.  That sounded amazing but they delivered it with no pineapple.  I might be alone here but the pineapple is the best part of an al pastor taco.  Like when I go to Taco Y Taco I always ask for extra extra pineapple.  I asked our waiter and he said no problem and went to the kitchen.  In a few minutes a manager lady comes over and apologizes and says they have no pineapple.  NO PINEAPPLE??? My tiny little heart was crushed into a thousand pieces.  Okay, I'm bein' dramatic, but I was seriously bummed.    This place has good food but it's very pricey.  Even though it's right next to our house we've only been 3 times which tells me it's not worth the price.  I'd recommend this place is you want mexican food in a seriotypical environment but it ain't a 5 star joint.",

They give you large portions of food (not to mention the soup, chips , bean, and salsa dips they give you while you wait for your food).   We were nicely greeted when we came in as well as when we were walking out. Everyone was very attentive making sure we had everything we needed and checked on us to make frequently.  Would definitely come back and recommend this restaurant for anyone looking for a good Mexican dine in restaurant .",

    "text": "Great Mexican food place off the strip that offers a lot of parking, good variety on the menu, and a nicely themed interior. I believe they describe it as \"gourmet Mexican cuisine\" on their menu, but I'd consider it more of a home cooking / comfort food type Mexican cuisine.   To start off, they bring out chips, salsa and beans to snack on (and keep them full). Most meals come with a small cup of fideo soup, so after snacking on the chips/salsa/beans and the soup, you're pretty much full before your meal comes out (especially if you get a michelada which are a good size). The food is probably better than any Mexican food you can find on the strip and reasonably priced (about $15 for a combo plate or up to $25 for some of their special steak / seafood plates).   The staff are all nice and seem to hustle around (the place has always been busy when we go), but expect to wait at least 15-20 min for your food once you order. Overall a solid place for Mexican food while you're in Vegas, me and my friends always hit this place up when we go to Vegas for the first week of football.",

We ordered guac which was made at the table and had the perfect amount of acid, yum! I ordered the carnitas, my friend ordered chicken with nopales.  Both dishes were wonderful. I order carnitas a lot and it's rare that I find yummy carnitas that aren't fatty.  These were lean but flavorful and I will definitely order them again. Corn tortillas were marvelous.  A win for Mexican style food in Vegas!  Thanks Lindo Michoacan!",

Every time I come here i always order their fresh table side guacamole (now this is authentic guac). My favorite dish here is enchiladas de mole. Depending on my mood I will get the Coca Cola carnitas. They are delish!   Once you have ordered they always start you off with sopa de fideo which is very delicious! There's always enough chips, salsa and bean dip which is a huge plus!  Lastly, my favorite dessert is the fried ice cream, it's a must if you have room lol",

We have been here before many numerous times before while visiting Las Vegas one of our favorite Mexican restaurants to visit while in Las Vegas. When we arrived the ladies up in the front appear to be still sleepy or unmotivated to be at work.  They just left the sense of welcoming to their customers. When we got there it appears that they were going through some type of inspection by the big bosses. It would've been nice if the big bosses would've stop by our table and said hey thank you very much for dining with us we know there's thousands of other Mexican restaurants in Las Vegas but thank you for dining with us but that's OK. My wife had the Chilaquiles and I had the huevos divorciados .   Both dishes were just ok- they've been better in the past- our waiter was ok point!!! Very, very friendly and professional- the flour tortillas here are homemade and let me tell you, if you never had homemade flour tortillas, you are missing out!!!!  The atmosphere in this restaurant is gorgeous beautifully decorated very clean everybody dressed so professionally the bar is to die for it's gorgeous the bartender there she was so friendly very nice. Made you feel at home-",

The ensalada suprema con pollo a la parilla had. a crispy tortilla shell, but lettuce tasted watery and chicken was cold and had no seasoning. Ranch dressing was on the side.Unfortunately nothing brought the flavors of salad together. The sopita de  fideo was tasty and a nice addition to the meal. Waiters were attentive.

I was worried that we would be waiting for awhile since the parking lot was completely full, but we were able to get right in. It's True the tables are a bit crowded in, but the service was excellent.  They had this lovely mariachi band playing live music and the decor was full of Mexican pottery and plaques.  Very fun atmosphere in which to dine!  The staff was so friendly and nice!  The food was just amazing and very authentic tasting!  My family can't stop talking about their experience dining there!  We will definitely go there again, soon!",

I have taken people here just for the specific purpose of introducing them to the incredibly flavorful, spicy salsa. The amazing Coca-Cola Carnitas. The oyster appetizers and the FANTASTIC made right at your table guacamole. Oh - they make it to your specifications!  Add on top of all this a great mixed drink selection. Original margaritas are ALWAYS good. The meats are all marinated and delicious. One of my favorites to get is the pork with green chili sauce. HEAVEN ON YOUR TASTEBUDS.  They are BUSY on Friday and Saturday nights, just so you are aware. The lines can often go out the door. However, even without reservations the staff at Lindo are quickly helping get people in the door and in seats, rather than standing around waiting for food.  The ambiance can be a bit loud if you are here on busy nights because they tend to get large parties and remember - there could be a loud mariachi band playing right next to your table at times.  The last time I came here our waiter was great. Our chips were never not filled. Our drinks were consistently refilled and our meals were delicious. I ate almost ALL of my food, which is crazy, but I was hungry.   If I could eat here all the time, I would, but um... I can't because I don't want to weigh 350 lbs.",

I had their enchiladas, which I didn't care for, but everyone else loved their food.  I just have to praise the staff: a hostess was by the door, opening it for everyone who came and went. It was 112 outside, and pretty warm inside as well, but the waiters were running around and working hard to make sure that everyone had everything. Like I said, the service was exceptional.  The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is because both my step-mom and I felt sick that night, and the food from this restaurant was the only thing I ate all day. However, I was fine the next day.  I definitely recommend this place.",

    "text": "I organized a no-host dinner here in June 2014.  They were very accommodating over the phone, taking my reservation for 25 and not hesitating when I called a few days later increasing it to 35.  What they didn't tell me was that they wouldn't have all of the tables ready at our reservation time.  We had one large table in the middle of a room but it wasn't big enough for all of our guests.  People had to stand around and wait until diners finished and their tables/booths became available.  It was a casual group so people took it in stride, but it was a bit stressful for me as the organizer until everyone had a seat.  The wait staff was very efficient and made sure they had a drink and dinner order for every guest.  This was more difficult than you would imagine as we had people up and about, visiting with people at other tables.  I heard nothing but compliments about all of the entrees ordered and I know that my mole was quite delicious.  One more comment about the restaurant -- it is quite loud.  Between all of the conversations and the wandering mariachi band, you have to raise your voice to have a conversation.  This is not good or bad -- the place is quite festive.  But if you are looking for something more subdued then this isn't the place for you.  Overall we really enjoyed this restaurant and I would not hesitate to recommend it to people going to visit Vegas.",

Everyone seemed very pleasant, one of the managers I think his name was Oscar, checked on us...a lot lol but he was very nice. Our waiter was very honest lol, but everything was cool i was really full; the quesidilla were heaven! and pretty big in portion for an appetizer, i was full before my food came which the waiter kind of hinted at when i was ordering lol but overall I would go there again....i just hope they stay concistant  with the great service",

I so impressed with the beautiful setting over looking the Las Vegas skyline. I've been to the Henderson location a few times and every time I have such a great experience. The food was amazing!!! I enjoyed the \"Gallo al Chipotle Estilo\" and the freshly made Guacamole.

You'll see most of the usual favorites and they start you off with chips and a fiery salsa. Most meals came with a simple Fideo soup, which was really nice. Our group had tableside guacamole, which was good, but maybe had too much tomato.   The menu has a bunch of Michoacan food, which is amazing. It's divided up by beef, chicken, seafood, and pork, with traditional Mexican stuff, too.  I had ranchero-style Octopus, which was in an amazing sauce. The rice and beans were awesome. I also tasted another diner's Mole Poblano, which is easily the best mole that I've ever had.   I had a \"Javier's\" margarita, which was top-notch. A bunch of folks had margaritas or daiquiris. They must have two hundred tequilas at the bar.   We finished with their great Churros. Everyone loved it!",

I was impressed that the place is always busy and packed but the quality of food and service is excellent. It is probably the best Mexican restaurant I have every been to and I have been to so many I cannot count since I living in Arizona and Las Vegas. Go there and you will not be disappointed, if I was more into Mexican cuisine I would give it 5 stars, well to be fair it deserves it so 5 stars it is.",

    "text": "I believe this is the same place that my family and I went to...it just looks different..but I heard they went under construction because of a fire...so let's pretend like it is:  I went to this restaurant because my family and I were visiting Las Vegas as we normally do during major holidays..Thanksgiving 2007 was no exception...however, this weekend was different because we vowed to stay off the strip and find \"local\" restaurants to try. After a search of the best Mexican restaurants in Vegas this was the first listing that caught our attention...mainly because it was voted by the people of Las Vegas...well that's what the local Vegas newspaper said...anyway lets move onto the review (caveat:  I'm a Mexican food lover trapped in a Filipino American girl's body...i LOVE Mexican food):  chips, salsa and bean dip = excellent.  If you have self control problems probably not a good idea to eat the freshly made chips and salsa because you won't stop even after your main dish has arrived..they're that delicious...  margaritas - there was not a single table (w/ the exception of ours) that did not have a margarita on the rocks..it's a family style restaurant and these families love their margaritas!  Carnitas (this is what I ordered...i don't even know what the rest of my family had I was distracted by the yumminess of my own food) -  Lean pork marinated with fresh oranges and spices. Slowly cooked in its own juices until tender. The state of Michoacan is known for the best carnitas in all Mexico. Served with chiles toreados, green sauce and guacamole. the meat fell right off the bone...  Overall, I would definitely recommend this place..unless, you're in a hurry to eat...this place was super busy (probably a testament to their food) so the wait was a little longer than usual.  Other than that this place is what Mexican food should be.",

These are very traditional dishes with bold flavors but they missed the mark. The only thing I enjoyed was the habanero sauce I asked for to try to cover the bland taste of the food although the sauce itself was bland. If your looking for authentic this is not the place and top of it its overprice. Save your time and money and go to a mom & pop shop. (Service is excellent)",

    "text": "So, I waited for about a week to write this review and this is why.  It was my best friend's graduation and to celebrate we went to this location, it was my first time and she highly recommended it. I ordered the Mole Pablano and the Chile Relleno, both were very good. I have not tried any mole dishes before but since this is, as what the others described it as \"authentic,\" I guess it was not a bad place to try my first mole. With the live music and Mexican decoration, and the sporadic \"birthday\" or \"congratulatory\" chants, gives this restaurant a unique Mexican experience that I have not yet experience. But let's get down to why I am giving Lindo Michoacan \"3-stars.\"   Although I value the quality of food very highly, I also value service. It was a busy weekend, but I can't really say whether or not it is a \"normal\" weekend for them. We had a big group, a part of about 20, and we had one waiter. I was one of the last guests to arrive and the waiter was getting everyone's drinks, I had a slight hesitation when he asked me and before I know it, he already was on the next guest. He also kept going back to me asking me, very sternly, if I was ready to order, wanting me to make a decision. After the third time, I said I was ready, but mind you, he wasn't really taking any order, he just wanted to know if we were ready. At this point, I was already peeved. And, he also managed to annoy half of our party. One of our party had a specific order and this was repeated 3x, twice in English and once in Spanish. When his order came, he was surprised that it was wrong. He pointed this out to our server and our server told him they can scoop it out for him or hand him a spoon to do it himself. After some deliberation, he gave the plate back and said he does not want the food anymore. At this point, the server called him an \"a-hole\" in Spanish, NOT KNOWING HE IS FLUENT IN SPANISH! The manager was called and talked to our friend and only then when this server came over to \"personally apologize.\" I do not believe it was sincere at all since he only have done so since he got caught! There was no compensation, that I was aware of the same server kept serving us. I was not happy about his service and wished we did not leave any tip/gratuity towards him. I would have left it to the bus boys.   Big question, will I go back? I would only go back if a friend, who also speaks Spanish, wanted to go. Don't get me wrong, I guess this is an isolated incident and the other staff are welcoming.",

We flew into Las Vegas to celebrate a friend's 60th Birthday,,   with the suggestion that we were going to the Michoacan (up in the Hills with the view) I read the reviews and really wanted to go there for dinner,,    the restaurant could not accommodate our group, so we ended up at a Pasta joint.     As we had a few hours to blow before our flight home,,  we decided to find the restaurant for an early dinner,,      a search took us to this \"Original\" location,,  What a GREAT find,,     I love Mexican food,, and this is one of the BEST Restaurants I have discovered.       Order the nachos with guacamole -    the owner comes to your table and makes the guacamole right there in front of you.   Great flavor and great chips.    I ordered the Menudo,,   wow,,  just as good a HOMEMADE.   a great blend of flavor and spices with no skimping on the ingredients.     With the chopped onion, lime juice and fresh cilantro.    Reminded me of my childhood.    I also ordered a Relleno with rice,,   truly FIRE ROASTED with great flavor.   Tortillas are hand made with old world flavor.    My wife ordered her Chile Verde dinner,,   the aroma was fabulous.    Even though the room was FULL,,   service was swift and courteous ,,   a Big family party of 21 were next to us,,  staffing was enough that they were able to serve this family of Adults and young kids all at the same time.       the aromas in the dinning room  were most inviting...   We will definitely come here  on our NEXT visit to Las Vegas.",

    "text": "I've never seen my cousin dig in so much, and he is a pretty sharing guy but this time he could not share his tacos. He told me to stop him from eating more complimentary chips and salsa by slapping him, and of course I was glad to do that (I ended up almost slapping him because he broke his say but he stopped me before I could). They give you refills if you order drinks (get horichata!). I know you would mot normally order a fish dish as a main in Mexican restaurants but me and my dads favorites was the tilapia, which was huge! But it was perfectly cooked; so crispy on the outside and tender in the inside.   The ambiance is very fun and cheerful and its very authentic. Serving portions are huge, and lots of complimentary chips and salsa (refills too) along with homemade tortillas (get corn tortillas) and even soup.",

    "text": "This place will not leave you disappointed.  First walking in, I thought I was going to be in trouble as the bar part was unusually hot. Didn't know if that was part of the Mexican charm of the place but the table seating was much cooler. You have to be careful with the chips and salsa they give you, as you will definitely eat more than you should. They are delicious.  The Cadillac margaritas were magical. It wasn't so pounded with sugar that it would make you diabetic, but it wasn't deprived of sugar to make you think you were just drinking straight tequila. It was the perfect blend and I drank a few of them.   There are a lot of interesting dishes to try out as it appears the owner is really into putting a twist on normal Mexican food. I ordered a bone-in rib eye that had a coca-cola sauce. This was by far the most tender rib-eye I've ever had. The coca-cola sauce added a subtle flavor to the rib eye and it did a magnificent job tenderizing the steak. It's something you should really try out.   The other nice thing they had there was entertainment. We had just missed the mariachi band, but we did get there for a guy singing karaoke. He was pretty decent and it added a nice touch to the meal. The other great thing is that, if it is your birthday (or close enough), if you tell the server, they will come out, put a sombrero on you and sing to you. The song is finished with the birthday person taking a shot of tequila and getting a birthday churro. Honestly, the churro was probably just for decoration as it was the hardest grossest churro I've ever had, but it's the thought that counts.   Overall, I really enjoyed the place. I didn't feel like it was hokey, it felt pretty authentic with the decorations and with the faucets in the bathroom being like a water pump. The food is a bit more expensive than I would normally pay for Mexican food, but since it was really delicious with the great atmosphere, it was definitely worth it.",

There are many places around town that offer great Mexican food, but none like this one. They go beyond the food. The life music, overall vibe, and outstanding service is something you won't find in many other places.   Favorite menu items are Queso Fundido with Chorizo, Tacos al Pastor, and Pollo al Pipian. My only negative mark would be on the desserts. Stay away from that flamed fried ice cream!",

Their organic margarita (slushee) so tasty. I recommend their Chile rellenos or their Machaca con Huevo; enchiladas de mole are cool; the sauce really depends on the chef that is cooking it. Sometimes \"meh\" another time \"YASS!\"   Everyone is awesome ! Jaime and Omar & Javier are my favorites. The manager Edgar is the most kindest and caring manager I have ever met running a business. He truly cares about all his guests, and goes above and beyond to ensure everyone enjoys their experience in the restaurant.  I love the music, the ambient. Truly authentic. I come here at least 4 times a month. This is the ONLY location I go to, because honestly, the others are so boring and the customer service is poor   && when it is your birthday, the whole crew comes to your table to sing you a bday song; put a sombrero on you & bring you a little treat !! 21+ get a tequila shot too!!!",

The soup they give you is awesome. So how did it get a D+? The dinners were terrible. As for the food, the \"gulf\" shrimp are salad shrimp that ruin what was a flavorful dish. The chicken salad was over cooked chicken on some leaves of lettuce. The mole poblano had the same terrible chicken as the salad that ruined the dish.   Bottom line: Stick to Taco Bell.",

That's ALL the beer and ANY of the margaritas, not just certain ones. Which makes that a great happy hour. I had a Cadillac margarita which was strong and so yummy!   They have an option for fresh table made guacamole which is fantastic! I recommend getting that at least once to compliment the complimentary chips, salsa and bean dip. The fajitas were well made, but slightly bland.   The atmosphere was fun and well decorated. The restaurant is much bigger on the inside, (Dr. Who fans will appreciate) which accounts for the enormous parking lot that seems excessive at first, but is completely understandable once you walk in.   The servers are all in authentic looking garb which is fun and festive. Our water glasses were always full, chips were refilled without asking, and the service was prompt and attentive.

Pros: We were greeted with a smile from the hostess and seated almost immediately upon arrival. Quickly after being seated, we were served chips, salsa, and beans for dipping. We ordered from the lunch menu, which included a drink (and 1 free refill) with the meal. The prices were great. I ordered a shrimp dish and my bf ordered the taco salad. Portion sized were decent.   Cons: Only one round of chips and salsa. We weren't offered a second batch with our meal. Food didn't have as much spice or flavor as I anticipated.

I order the shrimp with garlic, first we asked for a drink recommendation , we were told to order a Cadillac margarita, but everything is good. I ordered a mango margarita over ice, but instead was served a blended drink, dropped off by another server who left before I could say it was wrong. Our waiter never really came back instead, other staff brought our food , with wrong order of tortillas,. Food lacked flavor and rice was definitely not fresh, it tasted undercooked., shrimp flavor was just wine , no garlic and lacked salt. Probably the worst Mexican dinner I've ever had. We were given a check with a total, we had no idea what we were paying for when I asked for a break down, the waiter said oh S?&@ and walked away.  This was a total disappointment,",

I tried to talk to one to see what the issue was and in the middle of explaining the situation, she cuts me off to talk to someone who just walked in threw the door... These hosts don't do Sh**t. I was there almost an hour and I didn't see one of them sit anyone, all they did was write incoming guests names on a piece of paper and that's it.   There food is blehhh...

Fantastic and varied menu so anyone should be able to satisfy their Mexican food desires.  Every entree I've had has been tops and the tortillas are like those made at home, light, fluffy, warm and downright excellent.  I could make a meal out of them!  Very good sopapillas if you have room for dessert.  This is no doubt one of the best Mexican restaurants we have been to in the entire southwest.

While I didn't think it was everything it was pumped up to be, it was still very good.  Their chips and salsa (truly the measure of any Mexican or Tex-Mex place) are dynomite.  Their entrees are big and tasty, and the margaritas are also big and tasty.  Service is always quick and friendly and the atmosphere is comfortable.  There's nothing truly OUTSTANDING about Lindo, but it's good food that's consistently good with service you can count on.  What more can you ask for?",

Their prices are fair, and you always end up ridiculously full when finished eating. The atmosphere is what you would expect when walking in and you really feel like your in for some authentic Mexican food. The only real problem I have with this place is the limited parking they have available. You would think that a place that is so popular would want more parking, but the location does not really allow for much more so I can deal with it. Overall a great dining experience if you are looking for a Mexican dinner. 4/5",

I will say that whoever is making the salsa should be promoted to head chef. That was only thing that was good. Run of the mill Margaritas, just some mix and very little cheap tequila. It's a shame because everybody was nice. Really disappointing. Cannot for the LIFE of me understand all the food channel references...will not return for sure. Was tempted to give it a 1.",

Our table was cleared and ready for the next customer before we had even paid our bill during our most recent visit. The busser kept our ice tea glasses so full I ran out of Splenda trying to keep mine sweet. I may sound like I am complaining or being pissy but I really am not.   The food here truly is good. I have never had a bad meal and the service is always spot on, but they are so focused on turning over the tables they forget that their customers might like to take longer than thirty minutes to eat dinner. The roving band of musicians can be loud and annoying but it is meant to add to the authenticity. Since I have never been to Mexico I cannot say if the locals wander around singing while people eat or not.   I had Chicken Enchilada with Mole and my husband had the Coke-Cola Carnitas, I believe. Mine was good. But as usual, his was great. I love that Coke-Cola sauce. It is delicious. The table side guacamole is always a winner, but I prefer my chips to be lighter so while they do a great good I tend not to order it here. If you enjoy the free basket they start you off with, go for the guacamole.   The Original is just what it says...and there is a reason it has won so many Best of Las Vegas awards. so check it out.",

    "text": "Lindo has existed in this same East Las Vegas location for decades. It's longevity is a testament to the flavor and quality of their food.  The original building was damaged in a fire in the 1990's, but was rebuilt and stands to this day. The late Pat Murita dined here often. It was one of his favorite restaurants in the world.  Always friendly and attentive service.  Evening diners will be entertained by a professional Mariachi band.  The atmosphere is festive and lively. Great for groups and families.    The menu features a variety of authentic favorites from Mexico's Michoaca region.  The seafood specialties are killer. The camarones (shrimp) are always plump and flavorful. Beef, chicken and pork dishes are also excellent.  Anyone who has ever eaten here will tell you that's it's some of the best Latino food you will ever have.   They do a table-side guacamole flavored exactly to your liking.",

Served with chiles toreados, green sauce, and guacamole and was very happy indeed. Service was super fast and very friendly and the entertainment was fun as well. Located far enough off the strip to make you forget you are still in Vegas is a big plus too.  Between the birthday's being celebrated and the bride and groom coming in with their wedding party after getting married it all made for a fun evening that was just the right balance of loud and peaceful.  We did not take advantage of it -- and nor did I know it existed until we saw it when we left but the amazing part is: Our Desert Inn location, Just 10 Minutes From The Las Vegas Strip offers a free shuttle service from the Las Vegas Strip for our out of town guests! Call 702.735.6828 to make a reservation. Now that is service!!!",

    "text": "Found a new Mexican place I wanted to try last night, pulled up to the door an hour before close, chairs were already on the tables, employees sweeping the floor by the front door. So, away we went.  After a disappointing experience at one of the other Michoacan restaurants in town, we figured, why not give the original a try?  We were greeted and seated immediately, had our drink order taken right away, and chips were delivered promptly. So far, so good!  Checking out the menu, it wasn't sticker shock, per se - however, it was disappointing seeing how pricy the food was. If it is good though, it's worth it.  Deciding on our food, we ordered and watched the playoff game while we waited. Food came out in a reasonable amount of time, the True test was about to begin.  Cutting into the enchilada, it was melted cheese all over. + Tasting the enchilada, not super disappointed, but not wowed. The taco was good, a little lacking on meat, a little more lettuce and a pile of cheese.  Unfortunately, when I ordered my meal with no beans, they still put beans on my tostada, so, I paid nearly $14 for an enchilada, taco and rice. Sadly, this is not much more than had I ordered a la carte.   $4.25 for a cheese enchilada or $4.50 for a chicken enchilada?!  If friends want to go here, we'll go again, on our own though... not sure it's worth the money.",

It's no longer traditional cooking . You can tell the rice and beans are canned and bagged. To make things worse I asked the waiter to have them sing happy birthday to my mother and it never happened. Right before I left I asked the hostess to do it and she said she would but we waited so long we finally decided to leave.  Really disappointment. The music is real loud and you have to shout your order. The funny thing was I was told by a friend that this place went downhill and I went against his judgement. I thought he was over analytical.

There seems to always be a line, but they move people in and out so fast, it really is not much a wait.

Split between 2, the combination sent us home with big smiles on our faces. The house margaritas were tasty, large and one did the trick. The flour tortillas were hand rolled on site.  I would say this place should be on your list for authentic Mexican food in LV. The plates around us also looked similarly large and tasty. Definitely not a fast food place. Stay a while and savor some good food...    Points off for maybe having better chips and salsa (though neither were bad and we ate more than one bowl of each).",

Wasn't sure what to order for the 1st time. So I went with a combination plate with a tamal, beef crunchy taco, & burrito. The food was excellent. Couldn't finish it. I will definitely try more of the traditional food next time I'm in town. Lastly the customer service was great.",

Even when it gets busy, they try really hard to keep up on making sure your drink is never empty.  What I really like about this place is the number of staff they have working.  There is always someone around to help you if you need something.  The food is not bad, the bartenders make amazing drinks.  Most are young and my friend who loves this place cannot figure out how some of these girls who are 21 and 22 seem to make drinks better then most bartenders in town. For me, I don't try and figure things like that out, I just say \"give me a drink\" and I am happy.  This place is awesome and you should try it out if you have the chance.",

    "text": "Hands down my favorite Mexican restaurant in Vegas. It's True what most reviews are trying to get across: this place is authentic. It doesn't feel cheap like most Mexican restaurants and you can actually sit down and have a meal here. There is a band that plays throughout the restaurant and employee attire fits the theme well.   The food was delicious. To add to the authenticity, my husband was really excited when we were given sopa de Fideo before our meal. He's not Mexican himself, but his closest friends are and he has fond memories of their mothers making it. The portions are huge and the menu is pretty extensive and there are a few unique dishes that I haven't seen elsewhere. I had the caldo de res and the meat was so juicy and tender: it fell right off the bone. My husband was happy with his fish meal. You also get complimentary chips with salsa and bean dip. The bean dip is to die for. I want a can of it to bring home!  I only have a couple of complaints though. First, this place can get really busy! The wait time can be a little long, but the employees work fast to get tables cleaned and to get you seated. Secondly, since there is a band in the restaurant and it always seems to be packed, it can get very loud in here. If you come with a date, good luck trying to hear them. Might want to consider that if you're thinking to have a quiet date. Lastly, I understand that it's busy, but the service wasn't that great. And because of the noise, I had to ask our host to repeat himself several times because I couldn't hear.   Despite the few minor bad things that I experienced at Lindo Michoacan, I had a fun time. I definitely want to come back again.",

My husband, with 37 years with another Mexican restaurant in Epcot loved his camarones abuelito timo. I had carnita tacos with rice and beans. The rice was light and delicious, the beans creamy and the tacos- Wonderful in lightly fried flour tortillas. The margaritas were fantastic. The chips come with a red sauce and bean sauces so delicious. What a great restaurant the locals seem to all know about. Worth the drive off the strip.",

The menu is extensive (there's something for everyone no matter how picky ;) )and it was very hard to choose because everything looked, smelled and sounded delicious. I decided to split with my friend and we did ceviche de Cameron. torta de milanesa, and a shrimp taco. They all get 5 stars they were delicious and super filling.

My friend ordered corn tortillas with his dish, but was given flour tortillas twice. Two of us got carnitas burritos, and we both agreed that the plate had very little meat. One of us ordered a seafood soup that tasted watered down. Another friend ordered a chile relleno, but they forgot to make it and finally brought it when most of us had finished eating.  The only good thing I liked was the chips and salsa.",

Pros: the staff and everybody was so, so nice and we were seated immediately  Cons: EXTREMELY loud, couldn't hold a conversation over the music and other people. Ordered a $14 vegetarian enchilada with \"sauteed veggies\" that I'm almost positive were canned- it was not good. Please don't order this. My mom in law got the same thing and agreed it was not good at all/came out of a can. The seating seemed a little cramped with people bumping into my chair and squeezing in between our table and others.  Won't be coming back with so many other good Mexican restaurants in town to choose from.",

    "text": "After many suggestions from friends and coworkers to come to Lindo Michoacan... Jacob and I finally did! I would just like to say.... we are not disappointed!  This is probably the best Mexican restaurant I have been to since I've moved to Las Vegas, and going out for tacos doesn't count. When I want mexican food... I mean, rice and beans with chips and salsa on the table, and not small tapas or modern style Mexican food that's going to cost me next months rent.   When we came in we were friendly greeted by the hosts who promptly sat us as a table. Not only were we greeted by our server quickly, but we also had a very attentive busperson who frequently came to check on us. She refilled our drinks before they were empty, and would check on us frequently to make sure everything was okay and we had everything we needed.   A few minutes after reviewing the menu, we were greeted by our server who was very informative about the menu. He was quick to give recommendations when asked and quickly delivered hot chips and spicy salsa which a side of creamy refried beans! I was in love with the slight kick their red salsa came in, and knowing it's not their spiciest makes me even happier!  There's is one thing that I love.... spicy food! When we came in and I realized this place is known for the spiciest dish in Las Vegas... I had to try it.   Few had stated that their servers had persuaded them to eat something differently because of the spiciness. Our server stated that on a scale from 1-10, this was a 50.... so I ordered it, of course. And he wasn't lying. Even though I asked for half of my carnitas to be the Cry Today Cry Tomorrow, I quickly was holding back tears and my entire mouth from my lips to my gums had gone numb from the ghost peppers. Now, those who love spicy food will roll their eyes and come here to try it anyways, which I respect and encourage! If you can handle it. It is worth trying one time. The carnitas melt in your mouth and that flavor is irreplaceable. HOWEVER! It's been over 24 hours and my stomach is still upset from having a half portion of their ghost pepper salsa. So, if eating a raw jalapeno is too hard for you, just ask for a side of the Cry Today Cry Tomorrow salsa to try with your chips first.   On a side note! Jacob ordered the Chile colorado, which he swears is the best he ever had, and quickly finished before I could even take a picture!  This is the first but certainly not the last time Lindo Michoacan has seen us! I am ecstatic to try out the many wonderful dishes served here!  Happy Eating!",

    "text": "The moment you enter Lindo Michoacan you will feel a unique authentic vibe about the restaurant. From the traditional Mexican clothing, warm and lively ambience, to its vast cultural decor, dining in will make you feel like you're in Mexico. The restaurant gets very busy around lunch. There is limited parking space. Fortunately when I got there, a car was leaving so I didn't have to wait. They greet you at the entrance and you are seated right away. The menu is quite extensive, they have so many entree options for chicken, beef, pork, seafood, vegetarian and soup, and they make specialty drinks and offer tasty desserts.  For starter, they serve you with complimentary tortilla chips, salsa, and bean dip. The homemade tortilla chips taste fresh. I love the mild smokey spiciness of the salsa, and the bean dip is serve warm and creamy. I went for Apatzingan and chose two Chicken Enchiladas ($13.25), it comes with Spanish Rice, Refried Beans, Guacamole, and I requested for Pico De Gallo and Avocado Slice. I really like my meal, the food is so flavorful especially when adding more of the smokey red salsa. The entree comes with Fideo Soup, which is a tomato based soup with chicken broth and Fideo Noodles. It's delicious!   For dessert I tried the Lindo Flameado ($8.25) which is a flaming fried vanilla ice cream ball coated with crush cereal and serve with sweet caramelize banana. When it arrive to my table, the dessert is literally on fire. I attempt to try eating it while it's on flame and then one of the server glance toward me giving me the signal to blow out the fire first. Well that makes a lot more sense. My first attempt blowing out the fire didn't work, it came right back. It took me three times to make sure the fire was out, and by that time the bottom of the Fried Ice Cream Ball is already charred. I think this particular dessert is entertaining to look at, but it is a lot to eat for one person. If you do decide to order this, make sure you have someone to share it with. Overall I feel the dining experience is good and the service is quick and efficient. What's more enjoyable is when they gather around you and you start hearing them sing a Happy Birthday Song, they will make you feel truly special.",

I ordered their two (medium sized) burritos and my wife ordered the mole. Both were exactly what we were looking for.

The decor is a bit less like the taquerias in California, but more similar to the Mexican chains in CA or Tex Mex chains on the east coast -- cheesy, homey atmosphere, with the familiar margarita glasses and heavy plates. The menu is comprehensive -- a lot of generic Mexican dishes you would expect, plus Michoacan specialties.  I got the carnitas, and man, was it good. It was not the deep fried kind, but rather, slow cooked and stewed, which made it really flavourful. The green sauce complemented it well, and the rice and beans were good as well. It was a really big plate though, plus I always fill up on chips because I love salsa, so share plates if you need to. I barely finished half of my plate!  Service was a bit slow, but overall not too bad. I just want to taste those carnitas again...",

The food comes out freshly made and with speed. They move parties in and out as quickly as the customers want. We didn't feel rushed and we got constant attention to make sure all was well.  They had a mariachi band on a Friday night. The place was packed and large parties gathered around. They easily accommodate your group and set up long tables so everyone can dine together.  They serve chips and salsa and bean dip to start. While everything on the menu sounded tasty, I ordered the veggie enchiladas. The vegetables were diced and fresh. The side of beans and rice were great. I wanted to eat everything on my plate, but my stomach was telling me there was no more room. The portions were large.  I wish all restaurants were run this way. Excellent, hearts to serve, food to nourish and enjoy, and it made for a great beginning to a Vegas Friday night.",

I do think that the food is overpriced, it's mostly beans and rice on the plate and a portion of your choosing (i.e shrimp, steak, or chicken). The fact that it's mostly beans and rice on the plate is always what gets to me when it comes to the pricing. Also the steak usually has a lot of fat on it and the shrimp is always extremely over cooked which makes it chewy and rubbery.",

This was impossibly HOT and could not be eaten and this was only about an eighth of a teaspoon,  I had to run into the kitchen to ask for milk to kill the burn.  I had already ordered an appetizer and a pork dish but lost my appetite do to the fire within and had to cancel my order, unfortunately.  I would rate it 5 stars for service and atmosphere, but I really didn't eat.  There is a big selection of tequilas and mezcals if you wish to imbibe. Special thanks to Jamie, my waiter for being accommodating while I was on fire!!",

    "text": "Oh Nevada and their lack of Mexican food. We had to travel so much to get here but it was well worth it.  The reception for my grandparent's vow renewal was held in this beautiful restaurant. I really enjoyed the view of Nevada as we sat next to the huge windows and the service was A-OK.  I ordered some shrimp in a sauce of green roasted chili. It was very delicious! I sampled a few other plates as well. I tried the Camarones a la Diabla and they were not spicy at all. It was a disappointment. If you want spicy shrimp these are not it. I also sampled the Ensalada Marinera (Marine Salad) and boy oh boy! I wish I wouldve gotten this instead. It was very delicious and filling! Next time I am ordering one of those bad boys.  The red rice was alright, nothing compared to home-made, and the fried beans taste like canned beans. Sorry. However, those two didnt damp the mood for the rest of this wonderful restaurant. Their torillas were hand-made, their chips and salsa were divine and their fideo soup was delish!  I would definitely visit this place again but I dont think I will, it's too far from the strip.",

    "text": "So looking forward to this dining experience last evening...had been recommended by several folks in person and the reviews on Yelp only pumped up my taste buds more...  If this is Las Vegas Mexican food at it's best then someone needs to have their head examined....it was downright BLAH.  Chips and salsa up front was nice touch but Salsa nothing special. Beans were nice free touch too but tasted like straight out of a can. We had several palate's to please. picky 15 year old, 18 year old who loves fish and anything fresh, your texmex appetite and mine who embraces any different, fresh or just darn good food.  How can you mess up a plain chicken quesadilla... two bites and 15 year old  was done...tasted it and couldn't agree more. Shrimp enchilada sounds good and as there was so much shrimp on the menu you figured it was a easy home run. Chewy and fishy covered in a plain sauce...18 year old didn't get through a 1/4 of it and others at the table agreed. Chicken Enchilada, come on how easy is that...apparently not to easy! Barely passable and again just plain. I had the 3 pork chops, Chuletas was the dish name, marinated overnight in a secret sauce. Don't bother, chops dried out and the sauces only secret is that it smothered the pork chops in something I would only describe as tasteless.  The service here was excellent (besides 3 requests for water) and can't fault them in this regard. Almost all the people in their, both small and large parties seemed to be celebrating a birthday party and it was just way to loud. WARNING sign - they listed fish on the menu but all they had were shrimp. This leads me to believe they do not shop fresh produce, how can you not have fish tacos on the menu!!! Come on and yes this only dawned on me after.  We finished our meal and probably returned the food about 75 - 80% untouched. There was an apology from the waiter but no manager to come and ask why, no credit on the bill... NOTHING.  We left our tip and were out of there and likely to never return...$100 down the drain.  I am rarely this bad when writing reviews but when you have options like Mundos in town and Don Juan for texmex/fresh food then I would recommend you steering clear of this over rated Mexican establishment.  Sorry Lindo...",

Our 1st experience was for dinner over a year ago & our 2nd experience was about a month ago for lunch. 2nd experience much better than 1st..lol.  Personally I think the dinner menu is too big of portions for me & not enough items I like.. It was evening so atmosphere was very dark, also very loud & crowded.. We were in a both by a 20 top..lol. Couldn't even here ourselves talk to each other..  but that's okay.. thats what type of ambiance goes with authentic Mexican joints :) food was so so.. My husband found musclely stringy tendon type meat in his beef.. & was pretty grossed out to say the least.  Buuuuuut we have recently went back for lunch.. just randomly stopped in. And it was amazing! food was fresh, service was great & lunch menu was just right for me   We LOVE their hot suace they give you with chips. We love how spicy it is.

I arrived at the restaurant Sunday morning around 11am.  After a short review of the menu I decide to try there Sunday morning brunch.  Which was a reasonable deal considering it came with drinks.  The brunch bar itself is somewhat awkwardly setup in the bar area.  However it was still a nice presentation with a wide variety of options.    Being a buffet I of curse had to have a taste of every option laid before me.  I was very pleased with everything.  All of the food seemed to be fresh and didn't have any signs of being attended for hours before I arrived.  The fresh made tortillas and margaritas are amazing.  One final note about there handling a birthdays.  This particular dining occasion was to celebrate a friends birthday.  After our meal the entire wait staff came over with a guitar and sang a birthday tone in Spanish.  They also treated the birthday boy to a shoot of tequila and some churrus with a candle in them.  It was very entertaining, on the restaurant, and no one in our group put them up to it.  Overall a very nice place to eat drink and be merry.",

We got into Vegas late last Friday and drove over to eat prior to checking into out hotel. We were a party of 3 and were starving because we hadn't eaten and we were really looking forward to eating at this restaurant. The atmosphere was great, the servers were friendly and always refilled our chips, bean dip, salsa, and beverages. We order the nachos monarca's as an appetizer. They are really delicious. Then we ordered our entrees. All three of us were very disappointed in our meals. My daughter and her boyfriend ordered the Huetamo and I ordered the Morelia. There was absolutely no flavor to anything! The chicken tasted like boiled chicken and nothing else. The beef was bland, no seasoning whatsoever. The beans tasted like they were from a can, as well as the enchilada sauce. The chile relleno hardly had any cheese and the sauce was sweet (this may have been the way they make it, but I don't like sweet sauces unless it's on a dessert). The rice tasted like steamed rice, with no seasoning and they add corn, Lima beans, green beans (I don't like vegetables in Mexican/Spanish rice). It was greatly disappointing after seeing how many rave reviews they had. We barely ate our entrees and loaded up on the nachos, chips and salsa. I gave this review 2 stars based on atmosphere and attentive staff. I would not revisit this restaurant. Not at all authentic Mexican food.",

    "text": "It is good food and a fair representation of various Mexican culinary favorites. HOWEVER, this menu is NOT as food were to be served in a Mexican restaurant. The food and it's presentation are tweaks and various changes to suit all Americanized pallets. So anyone ignorant enough to assume all Spanish speakers are \"mexicans\" is really clueless. The fact is, there are diverse cultural differences in the Latino communities; one major difference is that of cuisine. Central and southern America have very different foods, nothing close to the AmeriMexican cuisine we are familiar. Example: in the entire Countries of Bolivia, Peru, Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay, Ecuador, and others... THEY HAVE NEVER HEARD OF, OR EATEN \"MEXICAN TORTILLAS\".  Can you imagine... there are no flour or corn tortillas in almost all of South America? It's a fact people. They never heard of or eaten Tacos, Enchilada, Quesadilla, or burritos!  So please carefully comment here, so as to not be so obvious of your ignorances or bigotry, rather just critique the food and it's service. So remember not all Spanish speaking Latin individuals here in Nevada are all \"Mexican\".   There is a huge and diverse awesome plethora of different cuisine in all of Latin America which you should venture out and try it. Some very delicious and some, well... Just different.  This restaurant is delicious and they strive for freshness, variety, and taste. Which is pretty good and worth the cost and drive there, but they do particularly focus on \"MICHOACAN, MEXICO\" food. The state of MICHOACAN inside of Mexico does have good food and they serve all the other loved Typical \"Mexican foods\" you are used to, so try it and if you notice other Latino descent individuals dining there... Please know that they are simply there for the same reason everyone goes there, the food!  In fact would it not make sense that in fact, Mexican people could whip these things at home quite easily. But someone who is not Mexican, would be logical to eat out good food that they do not ordinarily make at home!? DUH.",

We sat 15 minutes before the waiter, Carlos asked what we were drinking. We finally ordered our food. It took a long time to get our food and it was cold. I'm guessing it must've been up but our waiter didn't bring it out when he should've. There was this party of 8 with kids and they were ordering drink after drinks. The woman was laughing SO LOUD we couldn't hear anything but her!!! All we could hear was that loud laughing hyena. It was so hard to hear my family. Everybody there looked annoyed by the loud noise coming out of her mouth! To make matters worse, our waiter didn't check on us. He was busy singing happy birthday to 3 tables. It was a really bad experience. I will NEVER go back to that location again.",

Great food, and didn't feel like a Vegas chain but more like some of the family restaurants out this way in California. The traditional mole sauce was killer. Waiter made the guacamole right at the table, adding jalepenos to suit the requested amount of hotness (lots). Excellent, attentive service. One of the better choices for Mexican in Vegas.",

    "text": "While the food was excellent, and our booth was comfortable, there were some significant problems on my first visit here.    Limey Guacamole made tableside to order of spice, tomatoes, onions, and cilantro tasted very good, along with homemade tortilla chips, hot salsa, and a mild Bean Dip.  Fideo Soup was different and interesting: tomato based but not noticeably so, with delicate thin and short noodles.  Water refills came slowly, and had to be requested.  But, far worse, food was really long in coming.  We were told \"the food's on the way\" and \"It should be here soon!\"  But it really wasn't.  In fact, my party of four was seated at 6:30 p.m.; we ordered the main meal at 7:00 p.m.; and, other than guacamole and soup, no food arrived until 57 minutes later.  A friend's shrimp dish was requested to be avocado free, but her order of a Mexican Omelet included sliced avocados,  The manager did take items off the bill, but I would much rather had my order timely served.  Diane enjoyed her Shrimp Quesadilla, and I really liked my #12 Combo.  So, because the quality and taste of the food were so good here, I will make a return trip, and hope that the timeliness and efficiency of cooking and serving both improve.",

We enjoyed the atmosphere and wide variety on the menu. We were thrilled to learn it was happy hour (at 3pm), margaritas and beer were only half price, and that the lunch menu was still going.   Half the menu had English translations and half did not but our server was very good at explaining the unique parts of each dish and we had a hard time deciding!  We appreciated that the flavors were rich and dishes somewhat unique from other Mexican popular restaurants. I felt like something fresh so ordered the fish tacos (unoriginal, I know). The fish was high quality, grilled (I had the choice of that or fried), and very juicy! The sauces were also yummy and different than others I've had.  My friends got the Pescado Ajillo (garlic fish) and Beef in Chili Sauce and found both to be unique. The garlic in the fish sauce was a little burnt tasting. The beef was lean and served in hearty portion.  The margaritas we tried were delicious and my friend really enjoyed the spicy rim on his michelada! Another best were the fresh, hot, handmade corn tortillas we were served straight from the oven!  Our bill for 3 people for hearty lunch and drinks was $50 and we were happy with the quality and taste.",

The beans are delicious and easy to get full on before your meal...but wait !! There's more !! They also give you complimentary sopa de fideo to begin your meal before your food even comes out. We were borderline stuffed BEFORE our food came out. We ordered enchiladas, tacos, huevos rancheros, and the ensalada marinero which was absolutely loaded with shrimp and avocado and the most delicious flavors and extra fresh !! So glad we found this place suggested by friends I encourage you to give it a try. Prices are reasonable and portions are HUGE !!!",

    "text": "I remember coming to Original Lindo Michoacan when I first moved to Las Vegas 12 years ago.  It is one of the first Mexican restaurants I tried here.  I loved it.  The sopa de fideo (noodle soup) to start dinner was such a departure from the standard chips and salsa.  I went back once or twice more after that first visit.  But that was followed by a long absence.  Flash forward many years and I was back.  I had a craving for a sit down experience rather than a taco shop which is just all too common here in good ole Las Vegas.  Yesterday I had the opportunity to stop in.  I was a couple of hours late for the lunch rush and a couple of hours early for the dinner crowd.  Still, it was a rather busy restaurant.  It is popular and yesterday was Sunday so it makes sense.  There were a lot of families dining but I got right in and seated in no time flat.  As I was looking over the menu, I was brought an offering of chips, salsa and bean dip along with the aforementioned sopa de fideo.  I ordered the combo number 6 which came with a chicken taco, a chicken enchilada and a chicken tostada with guacamole.  And of course rice and beans too.  I think my food came out right as I was finishing my soup.  Good timing.  The taco was nothing special.  Basically shredded chicken with lettuce and cheese in a crunchy shell.  About the same as I get for $0.99 on a Wednesday night from Roberto's.  The tostada was good.  It had the same chicken, lettuce and cheese as the taco but with the addition of beans and guacamole.  The enchilada was by far the star of this dinner show.  A large corn tortilla stuffed with tender and well seasoned chicken and topped with red sauce and cheese.  I'm not always a fan of enchiladas.  Especially with red sauce.  But this was rather good.  No meal is complete without a killer dessert.  I ordered a flan on this occassion.  I had tried the flan previously at another Michoacan family of restaurants location and thoroughly enjoyed it so I had high hopes.  The flan last night was OK.  Not stellar though.  It was smooth but a little dense for my liking.  It looked like the kind I used to make as a kid.  The Jell-O brand if that helps any.  The picture showed it with whipped cream.  There was none.  Just a little of the caramel sauce on top.  It was fine and did satisfy that sweet tooth but $5.75 for it?  Eh.",

Great place to go if you love mariachi music. Now for the food. You get complementary tortilla chips with salsa and refried beans. The food was delicious! I ordered the Al Pastor tacos which come with fresh homemade tortillas, rice, beans and green salsa.  Best Mexican food I have had at a restaurant in a while! I am from California and I will definitely come back next time I'm in Vegas.",

Have been going since before my 11 year old was born. Great food, all the time!   They serve beans and salsa with chips.  My favorite dishes are fajitas, chimichunga, *pollo sereandado*, pollo mojo de aho, pollo con rajas y crema, pork green burrito, sopitos, yummy soup... the chili colorado is not the best.  Lunch specials are great to keep prices down, come before 4, for that. Drink is included.  Horchata and Jamaica (huh-my-kuh) are yummy. Maybe add a sugar to the jamaica. Frozen margaritas are best ever, delicious: coconut, mango, lime. Happy hour is after 5, get the carafe! They have bulldogs too.  Fried Ice cream is yummy and also they have a plantain flambeau, strong alcohol flavor, ask for no alcohol if sharing with kids.   Overall, relaxed setting, great food, quick service, fairly consistent. Enjoy!",

I have never been to a restaurant with such superb & excellent service. As soon as you're seated, someone takes your drink orders and shortly places tortilla chips & dip on the table. My brother & I sometimes test the staff by seeing how fast they notice if our beverages are low. Not even a minute, someone is there refilling our glasses. Even if you would like to have your drink to-go (I love their horchatas and sometimes don't finish my drink), they refill the to-go cup before you leave.   I would suggest sticking to this location because of the service. I've been to the one on Centennial and the staff is horrible.",

The food is still good here, although it is better in Henderson, my friends shrimp salad had about 3 shrimps on it and every time she gets it at the other location it is LOADED with shrimp, including when we went last night. This location all feels more cozy and crowded, the tables are close together and I felt very in the way of the servers just sitting in my chair. They had a mariachi band that I could not stand, not that I mind the tradition music, it's just that this restaurant is set up like 3 small rooms so they went from room to room singing and because each room is so small is was RIDICULOUSLY loud. Also there would be other music playing in the other rooms so by the end of the night I had a migraine. All I all, I do recommend Lindo, but if you don't mind the drive, head to Green Valley.",

The food was amazing and we'll definitely be back. Couldn't believe how many people continued to visit our table for;  refills,  chips,  extra napkins,  tortillas,  cleaning,  etc...

    "text": "Wow! If you are visiting Las Vegas and want to have REAL, authentic Mexican food, then you have go here. The state of Michoacan is known for their Carnitas so I would suggest you try them. The food is amazing and the customer is outstanding. It seems like more and more restaurants are incorporating  the buddy system. We had  several waiters and this kept everything flowing, everyone was happy and had a great time.",

    "text": "Way over priced. Carne asada lacked flavor. You can always can tell how authentic the food will be by the salsa. The salsa was fresh out of the can. However the mojitos and fiedo soup where very good.  Casa don Juan restaurant is way better them this place.",

    "text": "The food, which was average, was generic Mexican food. However, what prompted me to write a review was an incident that took place during our meal. One of the members of my party had her purse stolen off of the back of her chair by either an employee or another patron. When the issue was raised, the restaurant staff responded horribly, and refused to call the police or check the tapes until the following day. When the manager was called to the table, his response was, \"so, you're going to go file a report, right?\" My friend, obviously distraught, was shown no empathy or compassion and it seemed like every manager and employee we spoke to was incompetent and confused. Oh! And they proceeded to bring her her bill at the end of the meal, to which my other friend replied, \"she will pay her bill when you find her wallet.\" After some persuasion, they comped her meal. Not a good experience. This was my first time here and I will not be back.",

    "text": "We came here based on all the favorable yelp reviews, the restaurant must have had a bad day because all of our dishes were less than average in terms of taste and quality.  The service was good and the atmosphere pleasant.  The food however just did not have that wow factor but it did have value (lunch menu).  I imagine that dinner there with musical entertainment can be special, their walls have some impressive photos of VIPs.",

    "text": "Came in on a Saturday night around 7:30 and the place was jam packed. Luckily we managed to snag a couple seats at the bar.   I had the Don Francisco which was a steak served with tortillas, rice and beans and a small scoop of guacamole. It was nothing to write home about. The steak was quite tough, but most steaks at mexican places usually are. The rice and beans were standard fare. The tortillas were fresh and very tasty. Most dinner specials come with a small cup of soup which was pretty yummy. It was a tomato based broth with vermicelli. Strange but tasty.  I had a regular margarita and a top shelf margarita and couldn't really tell the difference between the two. My friend had several beers and they ended up comp'ing our drinks because we both played video poker. Pretty cool!  The restaurant itsself was very loud because it was so busy, but the mariachi band was entertaining. The view of the city was awesome.  Overall a decent place - definitely not the best I've had, but a fun atmosphere nonetheless.",

    "text": "Came here with a group of friends after an extremely long weekend of drunken debauchery on the Strip. It was a Sunday morning and not too busy yet. We were seated right away and offered drinks. I desperately tried to avoid more alcohol but they suckered me into ordering a mimosa. I tried to convince myself that I only ordered it 'cause you get a complimentary drink (sangria, margarita, or champagne) when you order their brunch buffet. The mimosa was fresh and yummy.   The brunch buffet was $12.95 which includes the free drink and chips & salsa. The chips also came with a bean dip which was quite tasty. The menudo and posole were delicious. Rice and beans were great. Tortillas are handmade and served piping hot with your meal.  The staff was friendly and attentive. They seemed as if they actually enjoyed their job.  The bathrooms were clean and they smelled wonderful. I don't know what air freshener they use but it is divine.    I took one star off 'cause this place is pretty far from the Strip but worth the extra effort. Additionally, I noticed that there was a sign on the front window that said that they had been voted the \"Best of Vegas\" award for two years. That can't be a bad thing right?  I loved the fact that all the servers wore shirts that said,\"Save water, Drink margaritas!\" Definitely my kind of place...",

    "text": "Located east of the strip - easy to find. Lots of locals go here. The atmosphere has lots of color / ceramic tiles all over. The margaritas are excellent with premium liquor choices as well, the menu variety is wide with excellent chicken, shrimp and beef dishes. I tried their Dulce de Leche cake and being a caramel fan, I thought I died and went to heaven. Their guacamole appetizer is made tableside just like a Caesar salad - and with your choice of seasonings/spices - that too was excellent.  Highly recommended - didn't need reservations surprisingly and the place holds a lot more than meets the eye. If in doubt, though, make a reservation.",
