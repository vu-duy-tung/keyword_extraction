Took us about 25 minutes to get seated during normal brunch time on a Friday morning. I ordered the spam scramble with garlic rice and got a side of their glorious red velvet pancakes. Both were aaaaaaamazing!!!! The red velvet pancakes were so moist and with the combo of the whip cream, chocolate chips, and cream cheese frosting, OMG!!!!! to die!! My fiance ordered the adobo fried rice omelette and that was phenomenal to!! Good service and great food!",

I normally don't have any issues with sitting at the counter but today the counter was FULL of guys and they were all together all dressed the same etc. There was a couple and a baby waiting for a table and the old lady at the counter kept trying to get me to sit at the counter and I told her I wasn't down for that. It seemed like I annoyed her and she's like well there's going to be a 20 minute wait so I sat down. It was busy but not that full, so after I sat a couple came in and signed in for a table and not even a minute later they were seated ? I was like WTF?! The old lady sat them right away, I should have been seated as I was there first. The AC was cranked up really high too, I understand that the wait staff gets warm but it's way too cold in there. I love the food here but it always does a number on my stomach. I ran over to Rachel's Kitchen I wasn't in the mood to deal with temperature and the hostess",

I was hesitant to try this location because of the reviews but our group was forced to due to much longer waits at the other locations. I'll admit that the wait for a table was much shorter BUT the wait for our food was much longer than expected. I won't complain though because the food was just as good and worth every minute we waited. On this trip, our table decided on our usual dishes: adobo fried rice and red velvet pancakes. We also decided to try oreo cookie pancakes and a special loco moco dish of the day. Everything we ordered was a hit! You definitely can't go wrong by making a pit stop at Babystacks if you're ever in the Vegas area.",

When we got there we were told it was going to be a 35 minute wait. The crazy thing is it's a Thursday morning. I wanted to use that as an excuse to leave. My family still wanted to wait. To my surprise five minutes later we were being seated.  I decided to try the corned beef hash with seasoned potatoes and red velvet pancakes(I was really living on the edge). Again OMG, AMAZING I was pleasantly surprised on how awesome everything was. Seasoned to perfection. I don't like breakfast nor do I like pancakes. I know where I will be next time anyone suggest breakfast. Everything was so good and we all loved our food. Noone in my family could complain about anything and that is unusual for us. I could see why on a Thursday it would be such a wait.",

So try to avoid going here on Sundays and if you have a large party, call ahead of time. I love this place!",

Then we get to the food I don't care what they say these are processed products and there is nothing special about that I can go to a mcdonalds and get that kind of breakfast. The omelet was decent but again besides the eggs seemed like processed food inside the chili was just plain gross honestly.

He told the server it wasn't good when he came to ask how everything was he asked my boyfriend what he'd like instead he asked for scrambled eggs and bacon. When the eggs came out they were not even cooked all the way so he said something and he told the sever he was done and didn't want anything at all, he brought him another set anyways. My food was ok except for the hash browns they were frozen in the middle, I didn't even bother to say anything because there was no reason at this point. Quality of the food is nothing special at all could have made 10x better food at home.

Once seated, we waited about 25 minutes for our waiter to come to our table to take our orders.  Once he took our orders, it took an hour for our food to come.  Now, the previous time we came, it took a while for our food to come, but not that long.  Once thing I noticed was that the servers (three of them) were all busy doing something, but it wasn't serving folks.  It almost seemed as if the kitchen was at a stand-still, and food would just creep out one order every 10 to 15 minutes.  Once the food did come, the portions seemed small for the price we paid.  Now, this is comparing the food to the other well known \"local\" breakfast chain we frequent.  The food wasn't terrible in quality, it just took FOREVER to come out, and was overpriced.  I can't recommend them at all.",

I would definitely go back to this place not just for their pancakes but for that as well.   I really like that they do give you the option if you would like to upgrade your pancakes to something that aren't even ordinary breakfast pancakes ! They are very interesting pancakes and very good! I would definitely go back especially for their red velvet pancakes !",

It's always crowded because everything on the menu is fresh and delicious, and great portion sized meals. Whatever you can't finish you can always bring home and warm up, which still tastes great in my opinion for someone who doesn't like leftovers. Definitely the best babystacks in Vegas too out of all of them. :)",

They will not seat you until your entire party is there.  This is different then most places as they will seat your party if more than 50% is on site.  Pro- very clean, nice staff and the pancakes are delicious.  Price is 2 dollar signs and the do charge extra for additions which is normal in Vegas.  Con- not all food came out around the same time. My niece didnt get her pancakes until 20 min after the laat person was served. Not sure qhy it took so long, the waiter didnt say, he only asked \"is ot ok?\". My sister said yes but i would have said NO.  Outside of that- my omlet was extra brown and dry. The tomatillo sauce tasted like it came from a jar.   My family memebers who ordered pancakes enjoyed the food.  I am not a pancake person so i will not be back.",

There were about 3 tables with people eating. When we walked in I was asked how many and told the girl in the front 4 people. She said it would be about a 5 minute wait. I immediately didn't understand because they were not busy at all. There were a couple of dirty tables that had looked like they had been sitting there for a long time. We sat there for 25 minutes or so while the staff stood in front of us and were talking and joking with each other instead of cleaning up the dirty tables or seating us.   After waiting 25 minutes we simply walked out. As we were getting in our car a employee came out and yelled \"Hey do you guys still want a table?!\" I was shocked at the employees behavior and lack of costumer service. I didn't even eat the food but I will NOT be back. This place seriously needs to get their employees under control and teach them how to act professionally.",

And every time I come here, the hostess responds rudely to me when I return to ask if a table has opened up.  Last time, convo went something like this:  Rude hostess: \"I called your name already.\"  Me: \"I heard you say 20 minutes and it's been 20 minutes.\"  Rude hostess: \"I said ABOUT!\"  Woman, I'm not deaf, and what crawled up your ass? I always arrive before or on time. That's the point of setting a timer. Duh. Besides, there's no reason to respond to customers like that. Damn.   I've tried to order take-out from here to avoid the long wait, but from what I've been told this location doesn't do that on the weekends....or so they say. I showed up on a Sunday for brunch and saw a few customers walking out with take-out. WTF?  I feel like the food isn't up to par like it used to be. I was hoping Lola Cora's Corned Beef Hash would be like a taste of home cookin', but it was dry and unbearable to eat. The Adobo Fried Rice...meh, unimpressed. The Country Fried Steak is pretty good, and the Red Velvet Pancakes aren't bad.   What doesn't suck about this place? The waitstaff is great, and I've never had an issue. Rock on, waitstaff.",

On three separate occasions our order has been wrong, usually having to do with the potatoes (we order hashbrowns but will get seasoned potatoes, not a huge deal to me). Also, when I order \"over medium eggs\" I expect the whites to be cooked and not runny which they are always runny here so I just order scrambled. Other than that I love their selection of food!",

We don't usually come to this location since its on the complete opposite side from us, but since we were close we thought we'd stop by for lunch.  I've never had a problem with baby stacks, it was always considered one of the top choices for lunch.  This location felt a lot like being in a restaurant back home (Hawaii) with all the reggae music playing.    Our server, who I totally forgot her name was very patient although it was so busy. Being pregnant and all I wanted to order everything on the menu.  Slthough the I'm not the best food tester since I always order the same thing; the loco moco Hawaiian chili style! It's amazing   My boyfriend tried the breakfast burrito & he says it taste like any other breakfast burrito nothing special so I wouldn't recommend it.   I'd recommend this place if your looking for a decent, not pricey place to catch a good sit down lunch!",

Every pancake I've had here has been delicious (the nominal charge to upgrade pancakes is 1.50), especially the seasonal flavors like choco mint and pumpkin but you can't go wrong with the best seller red velvet. My favorite dish is the Mexican skillet- it's my go to as well as all my siblings. Nitty gritty: this place gets busy! Even on weekdays this place is busy by 930-1000 and groups should be prepared to wait. On weekends I would say to get there before 815-830. Service is courteous and friendly and usually incredibly fast.",

    "text": "I had to visit a relative in Centennial (North of Summerlin), while I was in the Ninth Island (Vegas).  He suggested we eat at Babystacks that serves some Hawaiian Style grinds, and I'm glad he did.  Its located on Durango near Elkhorn, just off the 95.  We ordered Lolo Rick's adobo fried rice ($9.95 | chicken adobo fried rice wrapped in an omelette), with your choice of side.  I chose mac salad, while my friends chose country potatoes.  BS also offers loco moco, portuguese sausage, corned beef hash, as well as crepes and other traditional bfast items.  Da adobo fried rice was winnahzzz!  The chicken adobo was moist and nicely seasoned.  BTW, adobo has Spanish roots combining salty & sour flavors.  The Filipino version uses shoyu & vinegar to accomplish the foregoing.  It went well w/ the omelette, and we were stuffed afterwards:  5 Stars.  On the other hand, the mac salad was suprisingly bad.  It was comparable to store bought mac salad:  2 Stars.  Regarding the ambiance, this is a big place.  There are several tables in addition to a counter.  The space is flexible so you can combine tables for large parties:  4 Stars.  Likewise, the service was really good.  Our waiter was super friendly, and the remainder of the team gave us a lot of Aloha:  4 Stars.  Mahalos to my cuz for the rec on Babystacks.  The entire experience was very positive.  If you don't mind a little drive from the Strip, hit this local place.  You won't be sorry.",

    "text": "I am a frequent customer at Babystacks and have been for over six years. I started going to the location near Buffalo and Flamingo because it was near my home. We moved across town and I started frequenting the location near Stephanie and Warm Springs. Now I've moved again and am located between two locations, the one on Buffalo and Smoke Ranch and the one I'm reviewing now that's located at Durango near Deer Springs.   I prefer the location at Buffalo and Smoke Ranch, but with the severely limited seating options, there is often a wait, even on weekdays. This is my fourth visit to the Durango and Deer Springs location. This location has a large seating area, so there is almost never a wait, which is convenient.   Needless to say, I know what my favorite Babystacks meal, the Honey [French] Toast is supposed to look and taste like. Before giving a poor review, I wanted to give the location a few tries to see if my experience was a one-time thing. Sadly it has not been.   On my first visit by myself about two weeks ago I ordered my usual meal, the Honey Toast without powered sugar and coffee. The Honey Toast came out burned, very black on the back and along the edges. I went ahead a tried a bite to be fair, but it tasted like charcoal. In all my visits to Babystacks locations I had never gotten my Honey Toast in that condition. I showed my waitress and she brought me a new order of it, only slightly less burned, but the center of the Honey Toast was salvageable. I went ahead and ate it in disappointment. I didn't have the time to send it back again as I had somewhere to be.   On my second visit on the weekend a few days later with my boyfriend my Honey Toast was okay, but the waitress brought out his food a full five minutes before mine.   On my third visit a few days later the Honey Toast looked a little overdone, but eatable. However, when I put my fork into the whipped cream I came out with a kinky black hair. I showed the waiter and he had my food remade.   Today I decided to give them one last try. My Honey Toast came out burned yet again. I pointed it out to the waitress, but told her not to bother reordering it. I'd eat the middle and call it good. I asked her to please let the cooks know because this keeps happening. My coffee was also served at room temperature, but at this point I barely noticed.   I'm one of those customers that hates, absolutely hates having to send food back. It's embarrassing and I don't want to ever appear to be a b---h, and I don't want to ever risk the ire of the people making and handling my food. After three out of four bad experiences here, I'm done. I will not come to this location again. It's extremely disappointing to come to this conclusion because I've always seen Babystacks as a restaurant with high standards. This location fails miserably.",

    "text": "Babystacks is usually our go-to for pancakes. They probably have the biggest variety in town.  This was my first time at this location and like the others, it's quite busy. I NEVER eat at the restaurant because of how busy it is. Instead, we pick up and eat in the comfort of our own home :)  The Mr. loves the S'mores pancakes and I typically try different ones. I don't think you can go wrong with any of their pancakes. All that I've tried have been delicious, it's a matter of what you like and in the mood for. I think Babystacks has a pancake for everyone.  This time I had the Hazelnut and they were, of course, delicious. The best part is their home made whipped cream. It's delightfully creamy, sweet, and fluffy. I typically don't eat pancakes with whipped cream, but this one I can't say no to. I also tried a new breakfast item, since trying chicken fried steak recently for the first time (if you read my reviews, you already know), I've decided to broaden my breakfast horizons. I tried Corned Beef Hash and it tasted good, flavorful and crispy. Not really my thing though. I usually get Kalua Pig Benny here, it's really good! Hash browns were not my fave either, a little under-cooked for me. But the seasoned fries are awesome so I will stick to those. All in all, a great breakfast option, especially if you're a fan of pancakes.",

I went for the classic chicken fried steak with eggs, hash browns, and a couple of pancakes.  I'll be back to try one of the fancy stacks. And maybe one of the skillets.   If you haven't tried Babystacks give them a try.  Also I love the decor. The hand burnt pine wood makes it feel very cozy. But watch the tables. They need a wider footing I watched a couple of tables almost flip on there side.",

Only change I would made would be to have 2 egg yolks because I love over easy eggs and the yolk mixed with the rice. If you're not big on gravy, ask for it on the side although it's delicious!   Had the German chocolate pancakes- so sweet, chocolatey and yummy. Paired with chocolate milk :P",

We, my wife and I and our three kids, had the following: lemon-ricotta pancakes, red velvet pancakes, cookie butter waffles, strawberry sweet cream crepe, adobo fried rice and ranchero skillet. I tried everything and it was all so good. The lemon-ricotta pancakes were the best thing on the table and I could eat 50 of them and not get sick of them. They come with a lemon syrup which is more like a thinned down lemon curd pie filling. Mouth is watering just thinking about them, now, about an hour after brunch and still very full. Wait staff was great and the 25 minutes we waited for New Year's Day brunch went by quick in the busy and quaint restaurant; but, then again, any wait would be worth it for this delicious breakfast spot.  Two thumbs way up!",

When I first walked in I could see how crowded and people waiting for seats. They told us about a 15-20 minute wait which we figured wasn't too bad. At exactly 15 minutes our table was ready so I was happy.  I went with a egg white skillet, with pepper jack cheese, turkey sausage, tomatoes potatoes, avocado on the side and some buttermilk pancakes. Everything was cooked right and they kept my coffee cup filled the whole time. I definitely see my self going back. Pancakes were good though next time I will have to try their specialty ones to see all the hubub. My girlfriend and her dad liked their breakfast as well.",

The onions aren't fully cooked and there's so much what's the point of even having rice just give me a onion to bite into. My other half got the loco moco.. Why does the gravy look like water.. Not to mention taste like it too. I really wanted to like this place because it's more reasonable on prices than the cracked egg.   Oh well...

We ordered coffee, which the only choice is filter, regular or decaf. I took one star off because the coffee was not good at all and although our servers continually came by to ask us if we wanted refills, we refused because we couldn't bare to finish our cups. This was the only negative and I hope the business improves the coffee quality or decides to offer cappuccinos and lattes in the future. Now on to the positive, the food! I ordered a cowboy skillet with carrot cakes and found the whole meal to be well cooked and delicious! Ooh, that cream cheese syrup!!! My husband ordered the Lemon Ricotta pancakes and we both agreed they were incredible, and a huge portion. Service was excellent, all our food came out together, no delays in bringing the pancakes. Overall, great experience. We will be back, but we will stick with water and avoid ordering the coffee.",

Easy off and back on from 95, it's located in a small shopping center but there's nothing strip mall about it... friendly staff, clean and neat layout, plenty of customers for a Monday morning, and a veritable plethora of pancake choices for the carbs-be-damned crowd.  Their main menu goes from the basic eggs breakfast to a variety of Filipino and Hawaiian inspired dishes.  Spam for breakfast... sure.  Chicken Adobo omelette... of course.  I went simple:  nicely marinated Kalbi ribs and eggs, offered tomatoes on the side instead of potatoes or rice. since I was saving my carbs for the peanut butter pancakes.  Delish...!   Hubby had plain eggs with chunky potatoes which he said seemed kinda Or-Ida type, but which his bananas Foster pancakes more than made up for.  Momma had ham and eggs with your basic buttermilk pancakes and hash browns.  Given there was nothing left on her plate, I'd have to say she enjoyed her meal...  Enjoyed it so much, I know we'll time our next trip to make a stop here for sure...  **they must get very busy at times:  there was a sign on the door, first come first served, no reservations and they won't seat your party until everyone is present so be forewarned **",

    "text": "Breakfast is probably my favorite meal and Babystacks is definitely my favorite breakfast place in Las Vegas.  I've eaten many times at the original and second locations on Buffalo, and quite a few times at the third location that opened in Centennial Hills not too long ago.  Although I haven't tried the newest location in Henderson, I have no doubt the food and service meets the same high standard as the other locations.  As the name implies, the featured breakfast item on the menu is pancakes, and if you like pancakes, you have a great assortment to choose from (including Red Velvet, Cinnebun, White Chocolate Chip Macadamia, Carrot Cake, and many more).  At last count there are 18 specialty pancakes in addition to traditional, and you can have them as your main course, or you can get pancakes as a side to complement a different breakfast item.  Watch out:  they're delicious and the stacks are big!  Go with a half stack unless you're truly hungry.  But Babystacks does more than pancakes!  Their other menu items are just as delicious and also range from traditional fare including a variety of eggs cooked to order, omelets and Eggs Benedict, French Toast, crepes, but they also have a few dishes unique to the shop.  Be sure to check out the Kalua Grilled Cheese, the Portuguese (or Spam) sliders, or Rick's Adobo Fried Rice for starts.  Things to remember:  The North Buffalo location is tiny; the South Buffalo location is much larger and more comfortable, as is the one in Centennial Hills.  Also, they won't seat incomplete parties, so have everyone together when you arrive.  On weekends, every location I've visited will quickly fill up and a line will form on weekends.  Go early to be there when they open, or bring a book to enjoy during the wait.  Keep in mind though:  the wait is worth it!  Now go get your breakfast on!",

I dont think a wait is a bad thing in the resteraunt biz, good things are worth waiting for but me for this isnt that good. Its not bad either. Just an average breakfast spot with some times good and some times bad service.   For the resteraunt name referancing pancakes I was not impressed with the stacks. They were good but after ordering the white chocolate macadamia nut and receiving plain pancakes with a handfull of white chocolate chips on top with a very small amount of a fine crumble that couldbe madacamia nuts. Why bother?   I also ordered the HM1 omelette which I picked because it had cilantro however when I received it there was no cilantro. It was good just not what I was expecting.   One of the best dishes I have had there is the Kahlua pork benedict. I really like this dish. I dont know if the Kahlua pork is made in house but it's good. Basic benedict with a nice helping of Kahlua pork and cabbage.",

I give this four stars, only because the pulled pork could have been a bit more flavorful-- it helped when I dunked bites in ketchup. It also could have benefited with stronger texture-- the bites were a bit soggy toward the end.",

In my mind I'm thinking why is everyone waiting for pancakes???until I was told that they make more than that. I grew up in Japan and in Hawaii and pancakes is not my norm for breakfast food. Someone said they had adobo omelet. Say what??? Local food right down the street from me?  How come I didn't hear about this place before??? I came just before it got crowded and ordered the adobo omelet. Yummy!!!!!! Just like back home! Huge too!!! I could only eat half of it and that was pushing it. I could of stopped a few bites before but it tasted so good. I will definitely be back to try other stuff.",

Come early!  I wasn't starving so we decided to split the Huntington omelette and upgrade to the white chocolate macadamia nut pancakes.   While the pancakes were good, there was something about the omelet that I didn't like. Either the eggs were overcooked or it was dry. Also, the omelet just wasn't well seasoned. I remember nothing about the home fries, other than we received a large portion of them.  This one meal came out to more than $14 - which I believe is a bit much for breakfast food.  Although the pancakes were good and the service was friendly, there's nothing that makes me want to come back.",

I ordered Portuguese sausage, over easy eggs, steamed rice with extra furakaki, and banana foster pancakes. Amazing, amazing, amazing. I don't find many places with Portuguese sausage and I liked it here. The BANANA FOSTER PANCAKES was the star of my plate indefinitely. Delicious! I do recommend this place to everyone looking for a variety of pancakes. It also has some Hawaiian and Filipino dishes, so it feels just like home for me.

The manager, whose name we unfortunately did not get, but was wearing glasses, and a necklace with a circular ring attachment, was micro aggressive throughout all of our conversations, from when we placed our orders up until we attempted to make the check payment.   We understand how frustrating the events could have been, but this experience could have been avoided with making the split check process accessible to both customers and workers.   Anyways, the food was good, but wasn't worth the whole experience.   We appreciate how the cashier was more helpful in trying to help our table out. The manager, did otherwise and shamed us for not knowing of the policy.  It was unfortunate that we had to ask for corporate's number to be offered the possibility to pay for the bill. I've never been denied an attempt to make a payment...   We hope they get better machines that can process the split check process... please, administration, provide the resources... this will make business more group friendly.",

With it being 115 outside in Vegas, you'd think they would be considerate enough to at least bring waters. Then an hour went by before we got our food. It's always slow for seating and service, but this last experience topped the cake. Of course we'll be back in because the food is great and the prices are too. I'd just recommend that anyone who goes here doesn't go too hungry and to bring your own water for while you wait.",

That wait might vary..but you're gonna.....wait.  The second reason being that the food is awesome!  On the most recent visit, we were informed the wait would be 15-20 minutes.  I could feel the spike in my blood pressure, but this is Babystacks, and the food breaks the mouth, so we sat.  No less than five minutes later, we were seated and I was happy.  On this day there would be a coffee and a water.  The meal would consists of a Spam Scramble.  Spam is comfort food to me.  Eggs and Spam, rice with the delicious seasoning.  Oh, and add the garlic rice upgrade?  YES PLEASE!  To boot...you can upgrade to your favorite baby stack.  I dig me some of them banana foster flapjacks.  It's a cheat day.....BOOM!  Set your cell phone off to the side and enjoy your company cause a little Aloha time is gonna push kick da chest.  Chill.  It's all worth it.  When the food arrived and after asking several people for the Sriracha sauce it was everything I knew it would be.  Spam is yummy but attack the panny kakes while they are still warm!",

We've been to one of the other locations in the past and liked it a lot. Naturally since it's a new spot they were really busy...but they have a lot to work on.  It looks like they run specials on the whiteboard up front which is cool. I decided on the cookie butter french toast and my wife had the biscuits and gravy. The french toast was decent but there was a lot of egg leftover on the sides of the bread and they basically just threw a huge scoop of cookie butter on top. It wasn't anything special and I can't say I'd order it again. My wife's biscuits and gravy was really good at the other location but at this one it didn't even come close. The biscuits were dry and the gravy was super plain, almost flavorless.   The whole experience just wasn't what we expected since we liked the other one so much. While the service was ok, not everyone was friendly and they seemed to be understaffed. We walked in and had to wait almost 45 minutes but at least 10 tables were open. They must have turned away 5 or more parties because of the long wait times. We'll be back in a few months to see what's happening but if you're a fan, I'd stay away from this location for a bit.",

We basically go to this location because it is the closest to our house. We avoid sitting at the bar  because they tend to forget about you there. Both times we sat there we literally waited 10 minutes just go get drink orders.   We have had a nice Asian girl (who is pregnant) twice in a row now and she is awesome! I have never had to ask for refils. I wanted kalbi and eggs and she checked to make sure it was ready instead of just telling me no they didn't have it because it is not listed on the menu.   I usually get the Portuguese sausage and eggs with garlic rice or the chilli moco with Mac salad.",

    "text": "I've been here for breakfast many times and Babystacks never disappoints. I've only been to this location and the one at S. Buffalo, but at both restaurants, the service has always been fabulous despite the crowds at peak breakfast times. A fan favorite, as well as my own, is the red velvet pancakes which are rich and indulgent, but totally amazing. I also love their seasoned potatoes! My parents like to try new things off the menu every time we go and they've never been dissatisfied. I definitely recommend Babystacks but if you're going to come, come early! This place fills up completely by 8am on most mornings it seems, weekday or weekend.",

On a Thursday at 11:30, there was still a wait. No big deal, the wait was quick and the food was well worth the wait. Spam and Eggs, seasoned potatoes and Banana cream pancakes. It was truly a little piece of heaven. I teared up a little, thinking about how much I wish my dad could try the food, and how happy he would have been there. The waitress was nice enough to ask me if there was anything wrong and anything she can do to make it better, she was so so sweet about it. Its truly one of my favorite places to eat and a big selling point in me moving to Vegas",

Since we began going to here the service especially at the front counter has become atrocious. Yesterday I woke up to a charge from BabyStacks on my card for 07/15/2016 and I have not been to this establishment in 3 weeks. Now I will have to take the time to go to bank have them investigate the charge and point of sale date. This is very difficult when using a company card that has to be closed at the end of each month. My final complaint is when I arrived this morning to eat breakfast CASH in hand the place was moderately busy however I am one person and the entire counter area was empty. I advised the older lady at front that I would be happy to sit at the counter. She stated \"not yet.\" I stood there for 10 minutes, single person looking at 8 open seats. This is not that difficult to figure out. I removed my name from the list and will not nor my husband return to here. It's not that great with the hassle attached. I also did have to go to bank and had to open case and close account because I am just not cool with their billing practices.",

I got the red velvet pancakes,  my mom got the rocky road pancakes.  They took a long time,  and when we finally got them,  they were cold and dry. The rocky road pancakes had barely any syrup on them. The Portuguese sausage was lukewarm and ok, but not great.  We were starving, so we ate it,  but I won't be coming back. Oh well,  we tried it.",

    "text": "Just ate here and will not be back. First of all the seating was uncomfortable,  the booths are hard wood. The orange juice was from frozen concentrate. Ordered a ham and cheddar omelet, seasoned potatoes and asked to have onions and bell peppers added to the potatoes. On the side I ordered the banana cream pie pancakes. The first omelet was burned and included onions and bell peppers. I  tried the pancakes while waiting for the re-order, they were bland and tasted like flour, there were two pieces of banana cooked into the pancakes. The second omelet arrives, again burned eggs, not very flavorful,  and I was unchanged to add cheddar on the inside. Needless to say, despite starving, I could not finish the meal. When on my last bite, after my boyfriend was done with his meal, the waitresses finally returned to the table to ask \"was everything ok\", not giving us a chance to answer, she disappeared into the kitchen. When we went up to the counter to pay, we were asked by the lady how everything was, when I gave my opinion and pointed to the almost whole breakfast that I had left on the table, she made no offer to adjust the bill. Then our waitresses walked up to the counter and started arguing with us that had we said something at the table, she would have adjusted the bill, then repeated herself in saying it, I walked out and left my boyfriend to deal with her. The whole experience was a gross fiasco.",

We walked out and went to Mimi's where they sat us right away and served us coffee while we waited. Last time I was at Babystacks they messed up our order and we waited 20 mins for them to bring us the correct food and it was cold. Will not be going again.",

My husband and I are celebrating our 15th anniversary and this is where I wanted to go for lunch. I ordered my usual, rocky road pancakes. When they came, they weren't right. They had chocolate chips on them instead of the normal marshmallows. I sent it back and was sure to be nice to the server...after all, it wasn't his fault. 25 mins later, I STILL hadn't gotten my pancakes. My husband had eaten his entire meal while I sat there and watched numerous tables get their orders. I've worked in restaurants, the common practice is to fix a customer's order before working on new orders. I complained to the manager and all she could say was \"there's a health inspector here and she's not letting us work.\" Really? Because other people have gotten their food, no problem. Then she offered to take it off my bill. Gee, how generous of you...SINCE I NEVER EVEN GOT THE FOOD! I walked out extremely pissed and will not be back",

Kalua pig benedict - a traditional eggs benedict with shredded kalua pig on top instead of the ham. Super flavorful, I actually prefer this version. Adobo fried rice omelet - this is a monster! Maybe share with a friend and split some pancakes too. A generous portion of adobo fried rice wrapped in a very thin egg omlete. The fried rice is the bomb and hearty. Well seasoned and delicious. Also, so many pancakes! So many flavors! You'll have to make at least 5 trips back just to sample them all. Yum",

Our waiter acknowledged us quickly and took our drink order and then was MIA for around 10-15 minutes.   I ordered the Honey French Toast and my partner in crime ordered cinnabun pancakes.  Both were amazing! The french toast had a huge dollop of fresh whipped cream on the top.  So yummy.    The ambiance was normal for a weekend breakfast place.  We were seated super close to a very annoying family of 4, but we dealt with it. Overall service could be better, but the food was delicious.",

We did not have to wait long for the short stack strawberry pancakes and lemon pancakes. Great light textures and flavors.  Twice our coffee was just warm but the third time was just right. This was our first visit and we are coming back for sure!  Anxious to try crepes and some other items.  The menu has several varieties of pancakes and egg dishes, including the chocolate chip pancakes I plan on trying soon.

The main things are -  The food seems to be a bit overcooked. If you look through a lot of the pictures, especially the pancakes, a lot of them are cooked or even burnt.  What boggles my mind is - why would the cook even serve them? Then, why would the waiter think those are okay to serve? Shesh...it's so bizarre to me.  We ordered the carrot cake pancakes and they were overcooked, but still edible. Yes, we ate them. I will praise them on one thing, the cheesecake icing is delightful.  On top of that, we had the Mexican Skillet and the Spinach Benedict.   Both were okay. Biggest thing for both of us were both dishes were very soggy. Everything, from the potatoes to the english muffin. It makes it to where the dish is not very enjoyable. I don't know if they were just sitting in the window for awhile or what.   The service was good - we went in past 12, so it wasn't very busy. Easy to get a seat and the server was pretty attentive.   To round it up - you have a lot of options to choose for brunch or breakfast in the Centennial area. If you're feeling a little risky, do try.",

I'm more biased in ordering their Hawaiian/Filipino breakfasts more than anything else .  I often order the \"Rick's Adobo Fried Rice\" (adobo fried rice with shredded chicken wrapped in omelette) or the Loco-Moco (fried egg and hamburger patty on top of white rice smothered with gravy).   You have an option of choosing a side, which can also be any of their options of pancakes.  I am a big fan of the carrot cake pancake.  For a few extra bucks, you can order another side.  I normally order the Portuguese Sausage (cut into several pieces) or a side of Spam (2 per order) to round up my meal... I know this may seem a lot, but I was raised understanding that breakfast is the most important meal of the day.    Needless to say, I like this place A LOT.  I highly suggest anyone try this place, at least once.",

Wait times here are longer than the others, both for the seats and the food. Even when there isn't many people inside, you will wait.  I have been here three times now, and I did a take out, and each time I have been less than impressed. Perhaps I will always hold the first location as the best, but really, this one is alright. The crepes here are not good. Chewy and bland, really a let down. The quality of the skillets and pancakes has been hit or miss. One time my stack was under cooked in the middle, very gooey.  Service is slow, and the benches are really not made right. They are not comfortable at all.  Overall it's a good fix when you don't feel like driving to another one, but if you are really in need, just make the drive.",

This is one of the newest in the neighborhood and the 3rd location for Babystacks.   I got the adobo fried rice omelette- The adobo had good flavor and the omelette was fluffy and cooked right. You get a choice of side (mac salad, potatoes, pancakes) and I chose the macaroni which was fairly standard and decent.   Lemon ricotta pancakes- this I think is my favorite on their regular pancake menu. Its a bit different since these are thin pancakes, like German style pancakes. I like it because its a good amount of sweet and the light tang from a squeeze of fresh lemon on it is nice. If you like those Dutch Babys this is the pancake cousin.   Service was decent enough, but nothing standout. We had our drinks refilled and were checked on.    I hope that the quality of the food stays at this one as I feel the original location has slipped a bit in my last 3 visits. I'm glad to have another option in our hood.",

I don't know how the eggs were actually dry and hard to cut through with a fork...thats odd. I went ahead and covered them with hot sauce so they would have some flavor. The potatoes were cold and old. I didn't eat very many of them. I know what leftovers taste like. I did come in at noon so maybe I got the remains of the breakfast rush. The pancakes were good but a little unremarkable. I guess once you've had Stacks and Yolks nothing else will ever compare. I will not return but I will drive 30 minutes to go to Stacks and Yolks...their pancakes are HUGE. So much better than this place.",

Tried the Kalua Pig Benedict and my husband tried the Loco Moco. Everything was delicious and perfectly seasoned. Also split the Red Velvet Pancakes and they were also worth the wait. Not as sweet as I had imagined them being and a short stack was perfect for sharing. Looking forward to them opening their Henderson location. Will definitely be back and looking forward to trying more dishes on their large menu!!",

This would not bother me however there are more empty tables than full tables. It's upsetting because the food here is great. I will not let up on the bad reviews and complaints until the management and host staff is replaced. I will lose this restaurant as much business as possible until the business gets better.

    "text": "I preface this review by stating that my main complaint, and the reason I shall never return to this business is based on one policy (well and other than the pancakes I find there food to be underwhelming).  Babystacks, at all locations, has a policy that they will not seat any customer until their entire party arrives. Under certain circumstances I could possibly understand this but I was so appalled by my experience this weekend and their response that I just can't go back there. So the first time this happened to me was approximately two years ago at the Rampart location.  I was meeting a friend there for lunch, they were busy, there was just two of us. She was literally about five minutes away. I went up to the counter and they refused to seat me until she arrived I was told \"we don't seat large parties until every one is here\" to which I stated \"two people is a large party?\".  By the time she arrived there was a wait, although there wouldn't have been had they let me be seated. But we waited and ate there.    Two years pass... till now, I admit I went back once about a year and half ago since then  friends wanted to go there. Last Friday I went there to meet a friend and her daughter who is 18 mo. old. It was about 10:00. There were a couple of people in the restaurant but it was not busy by any means and practically the whole place was empty. When I got there my friend was waiting, with her 18 mo old in hand. She didn't have to say anything to me I knew why they handn't seated her but I inquired of the host nontheless and was told we don't seat parties until everyone has arrived. Bad business policy, no one in the restaurant, you have a mother with a toddler (who anyone with kids nows is hard to do in a restaurant in the first place) and they are not busy by any means. I complained and the host asked if I wanted to talk to the manager, I said yes and this other female walked over. I thought she seemed pretty young to be a manager, maybe around 20 but it could happen so I proceed to tell  her I thought that was poor service. Only to find out (after I finished talking to her for about five minutes) that she wasn't the manager either and the entire time she was smirking without apology which again just made me more livid. By the time I finished talking to her and was told she wasn't the manager I was just too disgusted and tired to discuss this yet a third time with a party. In my opinion they should have a little common sense, if there is no one in the restaurant and it is unlikely there will be a rush of people i.e. it's not a weekend morning then why upset your customers by making them wait. So what if I went in and said it was a party of one - was seated right away and then hey I \"run into\" a friend who wants to sit with me - what then. This won't happen as I am not going back.   Okay enough of my rant - you get the picture. I will not be returning, nor will my friend who promptly left with me.  As to the food, the pancakes are good, however the rest of the food is just \"meh\" to me. They do have fresh brewed tea. Their potatoes are frozen, I asked and the waiter when I previously dined was refreshingly honest. So it's not like there is going to be a hole in life by not going back there. So from there we went over to Lulu's - which leads me to my next review...",

The place is alwaya packed so you might wait a few minutes before being seated but don't worry the wait usually isn't more than a few minutes.  The cuisine revolves primarily around pancakes but there are other options. Some even have a Hawaiian/Filipino take on them like the Hawaiian eggs Benedict they have on the menu. Easily some of my favorite eggs benedicts in Vegas.   Pancakes here are perfect and not dry like other places. You can get them standard or upgrade them to any of their different options. Most people I know like them upgraded with the red velvet batter but I prefer them with strawberry topping on top.  Very casual atmosphere and the casual setting is very welcoming. Every server I've had is super attentive too. Definitely check it out if you're in the area.",

Our server was amazing. like I said, food was incredible. I think it's my favorite restaurant now. I love a good cheap, hearty, homey breakfast place. There were like five parties in front of us for a wait but they got through them so quickly!   Only thing is I wish they had espresso drinks: lattes, cappuccinos, macchiatos, etc. or even iced coffee! The bottomless refillable coffee is nice though, so I can't complain about that. Overall, great, delicious time.",

This was one of the new places they wanted us to try and after eating here, I went back to Hawaii and told all of my friends and family where to go to eat!   The staff here is friendly and attentive. If we weren't too sure on what to eat the waiter ( I forgot his name ) was very helpful in recommending what to eat! They also kept coming around and asking if we needed more drinks and if our food was alright. The service was amazing!   Next, the food! I loved every last bit of it! We ordered what we wanted to eat and we all shared our food so we could sample a little bit of everything. I'm very happy to see that they have some local Hawaii favorites like spam and Portuguese sausage!   Overall it was an awesome dining experience! I'm glad I have someplace I can go if I miss the food from home!",

I ended up ordering it and opted out for the red velvet mini pancakes.   The adobo omelette was a huge disappointment. Given, the owners are Filipino, the adobo was horrible. Filipino adobo is based on, garlic, vinegars and black pepper with a touch of soy sauce. This omelette tasted more like shredded chicken over rice and tossed in Kikkoman Soy Sauce! Tasted exactly just that!  I couldn't even proceed to eat it even after adding ketchup!   The server asked how I was doing and told her I didn't want to eat the salty soy sauce chicken omelette and she offered me something else. I told her I would pay for it and to get me the loco moco. I have to admit, the gravy on the loco mock was good. I paid extra for the garlic rice and the patty on the loco moco tasted good as well!   Service provided made the experience well after a bad start. When back in the area, I will be back to try something else on the menu. It seems like their pancakes are the actual business.",

And it does look good, but I personally like a light breakfast so I usually get eggs. Their skillets are my go-to order.   Special shout out for the lemon ricotta pancakes - OMG. They were delicious. I unfortunately I didn't order this so I only got one bite. My sister would only let me have one bite of hers lol. It was really good. I thought it would be heavy but it wasn't at all. It was fluffy & light. The cream cheese syrup was dreamy.",

The garlic fried rice was an excellent complement.  The hazelnut pancakes had a well-balanced flavor, and will be a hit for Nutella fans.   Area of opportunity:  The food came out a little late, so there needs to be some fine tuning with the process.",

    "text": "I'm the biggest supporter of Babystacks, have been eating it for years, recommend it to anyone who will listen...  the food really is that good.  Today though my Babystacks love affair might have ran its course.  Was seated as soon as I walked in, no wait which is great, usually there's at least some wait.  Server brings me some coffee, I order, start waiting for my delicious breakfast to arrive...  reading some news articles on my phone I notice a few parties arrive, they've got to wait around 5 minutes to be seated, so I've been seated and food ordered easily 5-10 minutes before they arrived...  coffee cups empty, no big deal food will be out shortly so I wait, it is getting a little busy so I leave the staff alone, not too bothered at this point...  5 more minutes go by, party that was seated after me gets a full spread of food and refills delivered to them.  I start to look for my waitress, maybe my order got jumbled up it happens...  few minutes go by nothing.  Coffee cup still empty...  approach the counter and ask if maybe there's a mix up, people that were seated long after me are well into their meals and I've had an empty cup of coffee in front of me for 10 minutes...  lady is real blunt, \"sir your food it coming we are busy\".  I say \"Yeah I get that but those people sat down 10 minutes after I ordered and they're halfway through their meal, maybe there's a mix up with my order...  she gives me a stop bothering me look, says she'll check on it so I go sit back down...  see her call the waitress over, they have a conversation, while they're talking another waitress brings my food...  coffee cup still empty, no offer to refill...  at this point I'm playing a game to see how long it takes someone to refill my cup.  Food is room temp at best, bacon is cold to the touch...  my waitress comes over to ask if everything's ok, I say not really...  well is there anything I can get you?  Umm yeah coffee would be good since I've been sitting here with an empty cup in front of me for the last 20 minutes...  eat my lackluster $20 breakfast and go to pay...  lady says that'll be $20, I had already set my card down with the check, she stands there with her hand out I point to where I had placed it on the register, she scans my card and just tosses it on the counter.  I'm no body language expert by any means, but you could tell she was being passive aggressive by the way she just chucked it on the counter...  I'm standing there with my hand out to take my card back and she just throws it at me like she's dealing black jack on Fremont street.  By this time I'm past the point of pissed off...  \"Is there a problem?\" I ask.  She gets a look on her face like she's trying to hold back a fart.  I say \"Look, I've been here 100 times, never had this bad of service...  is there a manager I can talk to?\"  She gets this kind of fuck you, yeah I'll get you the manager kind of condescending tone...  brings the manager over and it's the same one who brought my food to me when the original waitress didn't...  I'm a pretty loyal eater, I have my spots I love and recommend, this Babystacks has always been one of those spots, but today they lost a customer...  pretty sure it won't hurt their bottom line, just feel really let down by my experience there today...  I'll be sure and let people know about Egg and I or the cracked egg from now on instead of Babystacks...  also wanna point out after reading other reviews I'm not the first who's had problems with the old bitty in the 1982 rimmed glasses that works the register.  Might be time to make a move, a hostess' job is customer interaction, she might be better suited washing dishes or something, customer service isn't her forte.",

Hash browns were good, but there were a couple of dark specs that were from scraping the griddle in there. They made for some nasty tasting surprises. The omelette was supposedly made with 4 eggs. They must have been small eggs. I have to say the amount of food was good, but over priced. $9-10 for two egg breakfast is beyond reasonable for the amount of food served.

She immediately ran to the back and within 5-10 minutes I had a new omelet. I didn't mind waiting because the omelet was great! The only negative part of our experience here was cashing out. We were at the register for a little over 5 minutes before we got cashed out. The host told us it would be a minute, but it took a lot longer than we expected.

Because of the size of our party, we choose to wait outside. 35 minutes have passed and we are still waiting outside and we're starting to wonder what is going on. Shortly after, a woman in a white dress comes to ask if we have a party of 10. I said yes and she said that they've been calling for you. Not thinking about it, I followed her in. She went off to the side to talk to another girl, and I said \"Wait, you don't even work here?\" She said no, I just saw you and your family waiting for a long time from inside. I thanked her and said it was appreciated. I went up to an elderly haole woman behind the counter and gave her our name.  She was surprised that we were still there. Apparently they had just given up our table. I said, did you even go outside? She said yes we did. And I thought, wtf? Another non-working customer just came outside to grab us. If it wasn't for that other customer, we would probably still be standing outside one day later as I type this. So stupid. Don't lie to my face that you came outside when you didn't. Despite that Haole's ignorance, our server made us forget her and made or meal great. Get someone else to run the front.",

The host staff is awful. There have been four separate occasions where my husband and I have witnessed the host team seating parties out of order. It's not for any apparent reason either as it once was for a table of 2 which was the same as our party. We are not the only ones to have noticed this. This past weekend we saw it happen to another party who got extremely irate. They just seem disorganized and dishonest. They are also not very friendly as you come to expect the host staff to be from other places. It's a shame because the pancakes here are amazing! Try the red velvet pancakes! Best I have ever had. Not super sickening sweet, just perfect. They also give you fresh whipped cream.The coffee is also pretty good in comparison to other breakfast spots around. If you get a chance definitely check the place out but if you want to enjoy your dining experience all around go to one of the other locations...",

Needless to say, 40 minutes after we ordered, my friends received their complete meals and I received greasy garlic fried rice and some Luke warm eggs. My other friend that ordered eggs also noticed his weren't very hot as well. When I asked where my pancakes were, Jamie Lynn our waitress informed me they would be right out. I ate what I had, and everyone finished there meal.. And guess what? My two (yes... 2!!!!!) carrot cake pancakes showed up... Close to 1 hour after I originally ordered them and after other tables received various pancake orders. Needless to say, I wasn't hungry. I would never return here, nor would I recommend this place to anyone - unless I hated them. Poor service, subpar food and overall a disappointment. I had been wanting to try this breakfast joint, but I would much rather get better food and service at Divine Eatery on Hualapai... Or at IHOP on Centennial.

    "text": "This place is horrible! Let me first say that I have gone to the babystacks on buffalo too many times to count and I love it. The food was always exceptional, as was the staff. I didn't like how cramped it was, however, so I was happy when they built this one. So let me tell you why I despise this location. The first time my fiance and I went here he ordered a coffee that had been forgotten for a good 20 minutes so we had to request another and didn't receive so much as an apology. Then I ordered the Cinnabon pancakes, which I've had many times, without pecans because I am allergic. The waitress said oh okay no problem. Guess what came on top of my pancakes? Yep, you guessed it, pecans!! So that right there did not make me fall in love. BUT...I decided to give it another chance. We went again a few weeks later. I ordered the cookies and cream pancakes and made sure it didn't come with any nuts. I was assured it didn't. When my pancakes came out I saw a stray nut sitting on too of the pancakes...it wasn't exactly hidden folks. The waiter apologized and took them to get remade. Let me just let you know that I  am deathly allergic to all nuts; like throat closing, hospital going allergic. The manager came by to apologize and promise me that my pancakes were being remade and she would supervise. They finally come out after my fiance was done with his meal. I start eating them, and they are pretty darn good, then I just decide to flip my pancake over and what do I see?!?! Another freaking nut on the bottom of the freaking pancake!!! Are you kidding me?! At this point I'm almost in tears. This is my life, like it's kind of serious. The waiter kind of laughed and took them away again. I'm sorry, is the possibility of me becoming seriously ill or even dying funny to you?! The manager gave me some bs and just kind of danced around it. I don't really know all I heard was wah wah wah. I wasn't just some disgruntled customer who didn't like something. This should have been taken a lot more serious than it was. Needless to say I will never set foot In this building again. Their pancakes are pretty freaking good, but not good enough to be my last meal!!",

All four of us ordered our food.  Two people sat next to us at the counter and ordered their food after us.  Every one in my party except me was served their food as well as the people next to us.  I waited several minutes and our server did not come by, everyone was enjoying their food and I had to flagged down the server to ask about my simple order of french toast.  She quickly told me they forgot my order and I asked her to cancel it, she walked away and NEVER returned to us.  Then she sent another server over to ask me if I was sure I wanted to cancel the order and I told her, yes I want to cancel my order.  She proceeded to tell me, they forgot the order and when I asked how they forgot but remembered everyone else's I was told that french toast takes a while to cook, mind you the lady next to me ordered steak and eggs and still got her food in timely fashion.  Then she said to me like she was doing me a favor that she would take it off my bill.  I was truly upset at the extremely poor service and will not be returning.",

They're still working out the kinks as it is a larger store. They've got a new special, COOKIE BUTTER FRENCH TOAST!!!! It's the new craze that everyone's been drooling over! It tastes amazing and it's such a huge portion that I can't even finish it! The cookie butter is sandwiched between the toast, topped with their homemade whipped cream and pie crust crumbles!!' Are you drooling yet kuz I am. They got banana foster pancakes, I was hesitant to try them because I didn't want anything too sweet but wow it's amazing, it was the perfect amount of bananas, caramel and whipped cream! Service is wonderful as ever, very attentive servers. The hosts are friendly and welcoming! Thank you Babystacks for opening up in centennial! I can't wait to come back!",

The place was very plain.  I guess I was expecting it to be fancier, but it's not fancy at all.  Our waiter was very friendly and helpful.  The menu had tons of items on it.  Everything sounded so good, it was hard to decide what to order!   So, we each picked something to share.  We ordered the pulled pork grilled cheese sandwich with macaroni salad, and a skillet with scrambled eggs, potatoes, green sauce, and whatever else they put in there.  OMG...... everything was so amazing!!!!   We could totally understand why it's packed on the weekends!   The prices were reasonable, and the portions were fair.  My only complaint is that they are not open for dinner!!!",

The environment is moving but not too busy with the constant Hawaiian Reggae tunes playing in the background. The staff is friendly and helpful and the location is conveniently located to not have to worry about parking. My only gripe would be the size of the location making for a sometimes unwanted wait time. Otherwise, great food for a good price!  Update: Had the cookie butter French toast... Amazing!",

My dad had the senior breakfast with eggs, bacon, and pancakes. Didn't look that amazing- actually maybe IHOP or Denny's wow only with a higher price tag.  I'm not in a rush to head back there, but I might give them another chance later. $7.95 for 3 pancakes/9.95 for 6 on most of the special pancakes.",

Our omelets and skillets were either really salty or had zero flavor. I will say the seasoned potatoes were good and the sourdough toast is alright.

Why don't they tell you that before they seat you?  You think as a courtesy they would tell you that instead of just trying to get your business and make you suffer in the heat.  Got our orders and when they brought the butter packet for my pancakes, it was melted and literally dripping out of the packet.  How healthy or appealing is that!

The best thing about this place is the hazelnut pancakes with nutella. I must admit that it was very tasty! They do offer a military discount. However the old lady cashier is not friendly at all. Not sure if she's the owner.",

    "text": "I have been to this Babystacks two times now. I assumed that my first time coming was a fluke and that maybe they were understaffed that day, but today I returned to find exactly the same scenario.  When we (party of 2) arrived, there was only one person at the front counter ringing people out and no host/hostess. We stood there for about 2 minutes until another patron walked in front of us and signed herself on the sheet. As she was finishing up, someone else walked up and took our names down. We asked if the counter was first-come, first-serve or if you also had to wait for that. The host told us he had to ask the other parties on the list wanted the seats or not first. He never asked anyone and the seats remained empty, along with several other empty 2-person tables. About 10 minutes into our wait, a group of 3 guys came in and sat themselves at the counter. Nobody stopped them or even glanced their way.   When we finally got seated, they seated us and the party before us, which was also a group of 2, in two separate 4-seater tables. There were at least two smaller tables on the other side of the restaurant, and I am certain they were already cleaned, because we watched them clean them. Why seat us in the bigger tables and perpetuate the incredibly long wait this place always seems to have?  The only saving grace of this place is the quality of the food. It is very good. If it wasn't, nobody would wait as long as you have to at this place. However, they need to make some serious changes to the way they send out orders.   When we finally got our food, about 20 minutes after we ordered, neither of our sides were included. They were going to be a few extra minutes. After we had both completed our main breakfast, still no sides. I got chocolate chip pancakes (which are just chocolate chips on TOP of pancakes, by the way) and the other person got toast. When they finally came out, the toast had definitely been sitting out. The first time I came, the situation was exactly the same, but the waiter had apologized and said the kitchen was behind. Understandable, but apparently their kitchen is ALWAYS behind. They seem to need more staff.    All the while, I never got a refill. The table behind us was seated after us, had their order taken before us, had paid, left, and been reseated well before we were able to leave.   This location really needs to learn how to manage their volume. It's never NOT busy. They need to staff accordingly.   Speaking of staff, everyone is very friendly and nice, but it's not enough to make me want to go back when there's Rachel's Kitchen in the same parking lot and a plethora of other breakfast joints just 5 minutes away.",

The cook just threw more gravy on top, that was still cold. The eggs were raw but the buttermilk pancakes were great. I won't be coming back.",

    "text": "This Babystacks location is really good for a private breakfast or one-on-one talk in the morning because not a ton of people really go here! Probably because it's just way too far from everyone else! Inside, it was clean, warm&inviting. There was really chill music playing; the atmosphere just gets you in a mood to relax.   Customer service wasn't bad for us, there was no one in there and they sat us down right away and gave us menus. They were a little bit slow walking around, but it wasn't a big deal. Plus, any time I needed something, I made a point to wave to them and they would make their way over! They were all super friendly :D   The food was pretty good, I had the Cookie Butter French Toast. That was absolutely delicious. It was warm, crunchy and perfect. Next time I should bring a banana on the side because it seems like it would go well with it. However, it was super sweet, so if you're eating it, you gotta have a sweet tooth, my friend!! My friend told me to order a side of the Red Velvet Pancakes, and I have to say that I'm really disappointed in them. To me, they don't taste like red velvet and the 'cream cheese' is odd tasting. Maybe I'll order at another location to see if it tastes different, but it was just a really big letdown for it being a famous item.   It was a fun, cheap, and relaxing experience to eat here and I will probably visit again! :)",

    "text": "Had family in town visiting and this was our departure breakfast.  We had a late start so we arrived about 30 minutes before they closed. The place had few tables left from what  I am sure was a busy breakfast service.  I have never been a fan of sweet items for breakfast such as pancakes or waffles so I was hoping for someone else to order one of there delicious choices Babystacks has to offer, and I could sample.  Bacon and eggs is more for me to start my day but I do love a good omelet to start my day.  SO that what I did. A build your own where you could select a cheese, meat and two veggies.  I ended up making a selection that was much like a \"Denver Omelet\" and try the seasoned potatoes and wheat toast.  this is a meal that will never let me down.  When the meal came out my omelet was a little small for my eyes but it would do the trick.  So with everyone selections I was able to try the crepes which were sweet, fluffy and delicious. I was able to try the s'more's pancakes as well which was more of the same.  Good but too sweet for me.  Next time I hope some one orders the \"Red Velvet\" pancakes everyone has been raving about.  As for me I might be more adventurous and try the portuguise sausage.  It has been awhile since I have tasted these and if I remember right they were tasty.   After looking on Yelp there are apparently more than one of these places in Vegas.  If you have tried one you have tried them all.  I will probably stay close to home and not seek out the others locs.  No need to burn the gas.  2nd visit   Ordered the Lolo's Adobe fried rice special. This specialty dish is an omlette with shredded chicken and fried rice stuffed inside and garnished with green onions.  The filling with chicken and rice was a little salty for my taste mostly because of the heavy soy sauce marinade of the adobo.   I was also able to try the portuguise sausage this visit.  Not very impressed, it tasted like hills hire farms ring bologna.  I have had homeade portuguise sausage which had a nice spice to it. This had almost no flavor in my opinion.",

Babystacks has a variety of scrumptious pancakes - we usually make sure everyone gets a different kind so we can all share. It is common for a crowd inside but the food is well worth the wait!   They used to split checks by pairs without issue, but now only split a check in half a single time. When we go to Babystacks with groups larger than 4, that can be quite inconvenient.  Bottom line: the food is delicious, worth the small wait you might experience during a lunch rush, and best enjoyed with 2-4 people in the group.",

The potatoes are nicely cubed shaped, which compliments the entire dish. On top of the perfectly golden potatoes cubs is the shredded pork. The shredded pork is  moist, breaks apart simply. Paired with jalapenos, and eggs served on top. On the side fresh Pico and sour cream and a side if buttermilk pancakes.  The hot tea is yummy served with honey.

The fries don't come with that much seasoning so if you like the flavor you should ask for some extra. The sandwich is fresh and especially good on sourdough toast. The meal comes with a pickle so if that isn't your thing then I suggest you ask them to not include it on your plate. Waiting time to get seated is a little much sometimes usually around 30 minutes but can go over very quickly. Food is served around 15-20 minutes. Worth it though!!",

    "text": "I've always heard great things about this place. The first time we came in we waited awhile (as expected) but what threw me off was upon walking in, you literally have to fight to get your name on the wait list. There is no order, no organization, no one there to greet you. The \"hostess\" is the same person who is running the wait list, seating people and bagging to-go orders. On a busy Saturday/Sunday, that's just not reasonable.   We came in with the whole family this past Saturday. Busy, again, as expected. We were quoted 30-35 minutes for a party of 5 with a highchair. Waited close to 50 minutes. The hostess was not friendly whatsoever and once we were finally seated, argued with my mother-in-law after she requested an extra chair.   I will say, the service afterward was prompt and food was definitely good but just that initial first impression kills it all.  For a place that represents Hawaii - they don't show very much Aloha.",

It's also kinda just there. Doing it's own thing. My only beef with this place was being told the wait would be 40 minutes... my friends and I then walked down to the dollar store to kill some time. After about 20 minutes, we returned - just in case they called us early. This home girl at the front was like, \"Oh, we called you like 2 minutes after you walked out.\" Uhhhhhhhhhhh!?!   2 minutes and 40 is kind of a HUGE difference. Only annoying because we then had to wait longer than usual for another table to open up. She then also had a group (same party size) seated before ya despite them having showed up after.  It's chill. I got fed. It was fine. It was 3 stars. K, byeeeee.",

    "text": "Randomly came across this place, after having seen and heard about it from friends, after our child's soccer class Sunday morning... we were informed of a roughly 20-30 minute wait, which was about what we expected for a Sunday at about noon. They actually sat us within 15 minutes, so I really have no complaints there.   The service was good, attentive and responsive. Definitely busy, but again, expected for a Sunday afternoon.  Having no expectations for what they would have on their menu (other than pancakes), I was pleasantly surprised by their offerings. Essentially any kind of pancake and topping you wanted, crepe or French toast as well. We ended up getting lemon ricotta pancakes, hazelnut pancakes, and something on the other side of the menu that tugged at my little Filipina heart strings, Lolo's Adobo Fried Rice Omelete: chicken adobo, fried rice, all inside an omelete.   The Lemon Ricotta was soft and subtle - the lemon flavor rather eases its way in like an aftertaste, but was not as robust as I would have expected. The Hazelnut was what my Nutella-loving heart was after: Nutella, whipped cream, and crushed hazelnuts, which added a terrific crunchy texture to the mix. I additionally added bananas, which I highly recommend for a balanced sweetness.   The Adobo Rice Omelet: it brought me home. It felt like a home-cooled meal that my mom would have made me, and I was so glad to have stumbled across it. I honestly didn't need the potatoes that came on the side.   Overall, portion sizes were huge, decent service, good prices, good and varied selection sure to make each member of your party happy.",

I can't begin to explain the inconvenience this caused the party I was with. On top of that, I drive 25 minutes to this location because I've always had a good experience and the food is great. But another reason is because it is military friendly. Today Krissy told my entire military party that she couldn't give us military discount because they had already gave us our check, although we hadn't even paid yet. I'm not looking for a handout but I will always support a small business, especially if they're military friendly. Not splitting our check is inconvenient and annoying, but to then deny military discount because we didn't announce we were military before ordering food is absolutely absurd. Again, I have been coming to various Las Vegas babystacks locations, but this was the last time and I will not return again.",

    "text": "We have been here a bunch of times and each time has been a wait. Waiting is understandable. I mean, if it's busy...it's busy. One can't control the wait.   The bad part about waiting and waiting is...you'd expect your food to be spectacular. So sorry, but it isn't. They do have a spectacular option for pancakes. I won't lie...I sure love their banana fosters. However, it is what it is. Nothing spectacular. You got your bananas...you got your foster. Lol.  The lolo Rick's adobo fried rice has failed us each time only reason we've been back a few times and ordered the same thing each time is because we were hoping each experience was a fluke due to the business. Dry, bland, and the distribution into the omelette seemed poorly executed. At the beginning of the omelette it's all rice then when you get to the end then out comes the meat.   Kids order typical.spam and eggs so nothing much to review because it is what it is. Spam...and eggs.  They don't seat you unless your entire party is present. So even if you're waiting on just 1 person, sorry...keep on waiting and watch all the people who have come way after you being seated to then having to wait for a table to open once your 1 person arrives.   Overall, I think this place is highly over-rated. However, I would.pick this place over an Ihop or Dennys hands-down despite cheaper options on said restaurants. But since we aren't much of eating out for breakfast kine of fam anyway, it isn't a type of place we'd become frequent customers regardless. It has to be something really spectacular to turn us into breakfast folks. Service has also been slow. Slow for refill, slow to even ask for our drinks, slow to order, just slow.  It is a great option to have this place up in the Northwest for those who are into breakfast menus, though.  Definitely kid friendly but because this place is always filled up and the lobby can get congested....skip the stroller. Enjoy!",

We ordered the WHITE CHOCOLATE MACADAMIA NUT PANCAKES, the ADOBO FRIED RICE OMLETTE, & the CHICKEN SKILLET w/ a side of CINNABON PANCAKES. We're fat, I know.  Everything was extremely good... My only qualm was that there weren't really white chocolate chips infused into the pancakes. Previously we ordered the red velvet pancakes, which were perfectly infused and I still highly recommend! The adobo fried rice was also really rich and satisfying. Wasn't too fond of the skillet personally... not as flavorful, but wasn't bad. And if you're into it, they also have sugar free syrup, which we were really happy about! Overall, definitely will return when we have an early morning sweet tooth! :)",

I usually have to wait a bit each time I visit though, at most half an hour.   The red velvet pancakes are the best I've ever had- nothing else comes close! It's not super sweet, and there are chocolate chips in the pancake itself, and the cream cheese drizzled on top isn't sweet either. They're perfectly moist as well.  If you're hungry, the chicken adobo fired rice wrapped in an egg is also bomb too. It's pretty heavy though, so you may go into a food coma afterwards haha.   Last time I was here I got the steak and eggs, opting for the garlic fried rice. Just a forewarning- they don't go easy on the garlic here! It was satisfying until the last bite.  I'll be seeing you guys on my next Vegas trip!",

Luckily for us, we didn't run into any issues with our orders. Babystacks is known for having Hawaiian style breakfast items influenced by a well known spot on Oahu, and If I see comfort foods like Adobo Fried Rice Omelette, and Loco Moco, You better believe that's what I'm goin' for!  Our server Mike (who was also one of the managers) was great the whole time, offering suggestions, checking up on us constantly, and even took some time to chat with us and even after our meal, invited us back to try the Cookie Butter French Toast, one of his personal favorites, Which I've already made at home a few times...;)  Wifey ordered the Hawaiian Style Breakfast Sliders with Portuguese sausage, eggs, and cheese on Hawaiian sweet rolls and added on Bacon Pancakes with maple Syrup and I decided to go with the Loco Moco with a side of their popular Red Velvet Pancakes. They also had a Kalua Pig Benedict which sounded good but when it comes to anything benedict, I just do it up at home, because I have come to the conclusion that no one here knows how to perfectly poach an egg! (at least in all of my breakfast experiences here)  Wifey enjoyed her sliders and I thought my Loco Moco was pretty good. Both the Bacon and Red Velvet Pancakes were delicious, But my faves are still Du-Pars and the Sweet Cream Pancakes at 50's Diner. Wecome to the neighborhood Babystacks!  ALOHA!!!

There are more than a dozen of cakes' to pick from. Options include: Red Velvet, Rocky Road, Chocolate Chip, Bacon (yup, you heard that right), and lemon ricotta (Lemon Ricotta is my absolute favorite). If cakes' aren't your thing, they offer other items like skillets (layers of potatoes, cheese, eggs and other toppings) , specialty items that feature SPAM, Garlic Rice, Portuguese Sausage, or Kalua Pig Benedict (another personal favorite).  Service at this location has always been great. The atmosphere is nothing fancy. However, their fresh cakes' and local ambience hits the mark in my book.  Warning:  Even though this location is larger than the one in Summerlin, expect to wait on the weekends (even if you arrive at a reasonable time for breakfast). The wait will be worth it and I'm betting you'll return again to try another one of their specialties.",

    "text": "Expect a bit of a wait, no matter what day or time you arrive for breakfast, brunch or lunch. This diner is popular with locals and tourists alike because their pancakes are da serious bomb and they have a globally-diverse menu.  It took us quite a while to make our decision as there were a number of menu options. If you're from the Islands of Hawaii, you'll enjoy the island spin on some of their offerings (the loco moco, Portuguese sausage, spam, rice, etc.).  This sunny morning prompted us to order Mexican huevos rancheros and Korean kalbi ribs with eggs and rice, with bottomless cups of steaming coffee.  Hubby remarked that the huevos rancheros were some of the best he's had over the years (and he's finicky about those)--he said the tortilla was crispy, carnitas well seasoned, eggs cooked perfectly and it all melded together into one tasty dish. The eggs on my kalbi dish were also prepped as ordered, the generous scoop of rice was topped with furikake seasoning and the kalbi had a nice easy  flavor, although a little too chewy for my jaws (dang that gristle). That still didn't deter me from finishing it. My dish came with a side of their short stack (which we upgraded to the scrumptious banana pancakes sprinkled with pecans). Lot of food for breakfast, but since it was the stick-to-your-ribs type of meal, it carried us through late afternoon before we were hungry again.  I'd been wanting to try this location and it sure delivered with tasty food and good, attentive service.",

I am not normally a sweet tooth kind of gal but holy moly these pancakes had me at first bite! They were so so yummy. They were moist and perfectly sweetened. You didn't even have to use the cheese cake frosting on the side.We also tried the Oreo pancakes they were also very delicious and moist but the red velvet is where its at.  Now the normal breakfast omelettes, eggs, skillets, bacon, sausage, etc. is your typically breakfast nothing too special. I got the scrambled eggs and the corned beef hash. The eggs were good, could have made similar at home but the corned beef hash was wayyyy to salty. I took a few bites and then couldn't finish them, yuck.  This place is well worth it if your coming for pancakes but be prepared for a wait. Oh and they won't seat you unless your full party is there. I will come back!",

This is one tasty skillet that has mushrooms, chicken, spinach, and cheese. On top of all that are two eggs cooked anyway you want -- I ordered mine sunny side up, which would've been perfect with some rice on the side. Originally, this comes with potatoes, but I skipped that and saved my carb intake for the pancakes.  The skillet is also served with a side of two buttermilk pancakes, but I requested the Red Velvet pancakes instead -- always a good choice!  Service - We didn't experience any wait time, but the cafe does get busy in the AM. Best to come here early if you want a seat. Even though it was busy, our waiter did a good job taking care of our table.   Overall - Babystacks Cafe is a great place to sit down and enjoy a filling breakfast.",

One time we had to go someplace else for breakfast because it would have been a 40 min wait. I'd say it's worth the wait, but eat a snack before hand!   I went here with a friend and got the Cowboy omelet which was amazing. The eggs were cooked just right without being too dry. The cheese was melted perfectly and everything inside the omelet was cooked well. I also got a side of the red velvet pancakes which took longer to come out. It was worth the wait though because once it came out, I couldn't put the fork down! I looove red velvet and these pancakes lives up to its name. It was soft and fluffy and not too sweet. I was given a side of sweet cream cheese glaze which wasn't overpoweringly sweet like some can be.   Our waiter was very friendly and would keep me updated on my pancakes to let me know that I'm not forgotten. She was very patient with us as we kept asking for a couple of minutes to think about our order as well as catching up. She also knew the menu well and suggested some of her favorites as well as customer's top choices. The restaurant itself felt like most breakfast places, which makes it feel homey.   I will definitely plan to come back when I visit Vegas! I really want to try their Hawaiian dishes.",

Well guess they don't like it when they are proven wrong. So they burnt our eggs. Our potatoes were so hard that my kids couldn't and wouldn't eat them. Ive been in the industry for many years.

I asked her what the WiFi password was and she told me \"I don't know, go ask the people at the front\"??!  Okaaaay, let me just do your job for you.  So, after standing in line for some time, I asked for the password which isn't a secret and is literally posted on the cashier stand for everyone to see.  On top of that, it is the easiest word to remember - breakfast.  AND, the cashier was kinda unfriendly too!!  Really dude?  Ever heard the phrase, treat others the way you want to be treated?  I appreciate friendliness just like you probably do.   However, something must have happened after that.  Maybe the manager could see I was ticked because different staff started helping us, and I didn't see the original waitress until we were about finished.  At that time, she seemed to have gotten the stick out.    Food is pretty darn tasty though, so that's a plus... So, just appreciate the good service if/when you get it.  There are at least 2 good employees vs the 2 bad employees that we had the pleasure/displeasure of dealing with that day.",

If you are going to have egg dishes on your menu you should know how to cook and serve them.  The country biscuits sounded very good.  If you like tan flour gravy with a few sausage lumps served over biscuits so hard you need a steak knife to cut them, you'll love this dish.  It was not hot, the gravy had a \"skin\" on it.  The seasoned potatoes were diced and smothered In Paprika.  I'm not sure they know what seasoned potatoes are.  This dish was mediocre at best.  The price wasn't.    The service left much to be desired.  They smiled through their incompetence.    If you want fancy pancakes eat at Baby Stacks.  If you want breakfast, go somewhere else.

I came here with my family (party of 6) and there was a bit of a wait... 30 minutes. It wasn't that bad, though! They were going down the waiting list pretty quickly. Plus, it was nice to spend sometime in this summer sun (no sarcasm intended. Today was a really cool summer day in June).  Before we knew it, it was our time! We our server was Allie, and she was the sweetest! She was exceptional and very quick, and the other staff was very nice as well. She took our drink orders very soon after we were seated. Shortly after, she took our orders and was very patient with us. My family was visiting from the Bay Area, and didn't know you can upgrade your Babystacks to a flavored pancake until the minute it was time to order.   My mom and I ordered the Pork Belly Tocino and eggs. It was pretty good. Homemade I'm assuming. I was excepting that bright red, sweet, and slightly charred Tocino. I've been craving! Sorry, it was good but not good enough to satisfy my Tocino craving. My mom was thrown off, too. LOL  My brother ordered the Country Fried Steak and Eggs, and he's a picky eater but damn, he cleaned his plate! Guess it was good!  My husband and I think my dad ordered the Corned Beef Hash and it looked bomb. They changed it from what I remember. Before it was the fresh corned beef hash and this time it was canned corn beef (wish I prefer).  My sister ordered one of the crepes. I always thought the crepes weren't enough to make me full, but the serving was big enough for two!  Service is always great here.   You'll always have us coming back!",

It was busy, but everything and everyone made it look like a well oiled machine.  Now that I know that weekdays aren't as crazy as weekends, I know when to return.",

If pancakes aren't your jam, not to worry. They have a wide variety of breakfast foods as well. I fall into this category, so I went with the steak and eggs. The steak was good, the eggs were perfectly over easy, and the breakfast potatoes were just yum. The sourdough toast was toasted perfectly where it wasn't too hard and destroyed my mouth. Crisp outside with a tender inside. Excellent job. The wait staff was friendly and were sure to keep you happy even when it was busy. Overall a great place for breakfast when you just don't feel like making it yourself. Make sure to get there early though because you may have to wait a little bit when it gets busy, especially on long or holiday weekends.",

Love the adobo omelette (pour some soy sauce on top), loco moco (with an over easy egg), cookie butter french toast, banana foster pancakes are my absolute favorite.   They only have one register so the wait to pay can take long. The longest I've waited was 15 minutes behind 2 people. The first party was splitting checks and it was incorrectly split which took a while for them to figure it out.   Otherwise, great brunch spot!",

They have so many different types of \"babystacks,\" from traditional to red velvet to cookies and cream to banana foster.. and that just scratches the surface. They are one of the few places to serve crepes, and the nutella crepes we're amazing. They also have a variety of traditional breakfast options, omlettes, skillets, and much more. They offer some unique Filipino choices, which I will definitely try next time.   Our waitress took great care of me, my wife and three kids. The service was quick and timely and the food came out hot. They offer a military discount as well! It gets really busy on the weekends, so if you go, get there early! They have quite a few locations in the valley, so definitely give this place a visit.",

When I sat down, I started to feel itchy. I just thought it was bread crumbs or something left on the booth that I was in. I kept wiping down the booth underneath my legs. I felt uncomfortable pretty much the whole time I was there. Towards the end of my meal, I kept feeling the itchy feeling. I wiped the area on my leg where I felt what I wish were breadcrumbs, and I got 6 red ants on my hand. I immediately stood up and looked at the booth I was sitting in and there were ants all over it. When I stood up, I saw ants all over the bottom of the table, the booth, and the floor. No place should be open if there are ants in it. When I paid my bill, I told the lady at the register what had happened and she said she would tell the busser to clean the booth good. I would have talked to the manager, but I was so in awe of what had just happened, and I had to go to the store and spend $10 on Benadryl gel for the ant bites because it was so itchy. Here are some photos of the bites when I first got them and today.",

If the service was just ok I would have rated this location 4 star maybe even 5 star. It took almost an hour to get our food, family of 4, we maybe had water refilled twice. I will admit the place was rather busy at the time but I've been to other breakfast places before when they were slammed and didn't get the type of service I received here. I would probably go again but not a Saturday or Sunday.",

Although the restaurant is small it reminds you of a family owned business. I ordered crepes with nutella and strawberries. First the waitress brought out the wrong meal but had no problem taking it back and my correct crepe came in less than 10 minutes. When I received them they were delicious! Perfect crepe texture and fresh berries. I defiantly recommend this place. This is a popular breakfast spot, especially on Saturday morning, so get there early or plan to wait in line for a long time. I think the wait is semi-worth it but I gave it 5 stars because if you walk right in and sit down your food comes out fast, and delicious.",

    "text": "Meh. I don't really see what the hype is about this place. The food is ok. Nothing to write home about, but not bad either. The pancakes which seems to be their \"claim to fame\" didn't taste any different than the ones from IHOP or Dennys. Sometimes I think people just assume that a place is good based on the wait. Kind of like a placebo effect. The atmosphere feels like a cafeteria. Really bright lighting. The seating is by no stretch of the imagination comfortable, it's extremely loud, and tables are super close together. Don't plan on having any sort of conversation with your dining partner. I've been there twice now and the service wasn't great. Here's what bugged me both times. I like buttery pancakes. Both times, I get a stack of pancakes with ONE of those little pats of butter that comes in a foil wrap - like the kind they serve with bread at other restaurants. And one tiny little shot glass sized container of syrup. Both times I ask for extra butter and syrup and the waiter literally comes back with ONE MORE pat of butter and another shot glass full of syrup. Come on guys! Is it really that expensive to bring out a little dish of butters? Really, I'd prefer a little container of whipped butter like most places give but the pats will do- just don't be so damn cheap with them. You should get at least as many butters as you have pancakes. 3 pancakes = 3 butters. The last time we went, first my drink order was wrong and they also brought me out the wrong omelet. Granted the waiter was apologetic and took care of it, but still. Oh, and they only serve Pepsi products- blech.",

She then gave us an attitude and seated 3 parties on the available tables and here is what upsets me. Two of the 3 parties said the rest of their group will be arriving shortly and she then said that's fine lets get all of you seated. JULIE allowed not one but two incomplete parties get seated at a table with no reservation just walk ins. When the rest of our party arrived we ended up waiting 45 minutes and Julie was extremely rude to everyone in our party she didn't give us an estimated wait time all she said was when a table opens up will seat you, but she didn't she instead seated 3 smaller parties, then when she finally seated us she yelled my name, threw our menus on the table and didn't even look at us, Didn't mention that our server would be with us shortly or anything she instead walked away and left the building. I don't know what her problem was but you alone JULIE are the reason why I will never come here again",

BUT this one needs help and I am so bummed that after all the anticipation of them opening in Centennial, this location has turned out to be a serious disappointment. First time I ate there it was take out and  I ordered the strawberry pancakes and may lightning strike me dead if I did not get home to find a freakin shortstack of plain pancakes WITH TWO STRAWBERRIES CUT IN HALF!!!!! AND THAT WAS IT FOR THE STRAWBERRIES IN MY STRAWBERRY PANCAKES!!!  Second time ate in. Ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes. BURNED BURNED BURNED! Ya know for a pancake place this place SUCKS! I don't know if it's poor management or lazy chefs or both but geez! I'm not sure I want to go for the third times a charm factor.",

I was so excited for the centennial location to open, but what a disappointment:-(. I understand being overwhelmed but making people wait for 30-40 minutes on a Sunday at 12, when not even half of the restaurant had people seated was crazy.  At one point there were more employees in there than customers, and they just could not get it together.  There were at least 6 people standing at the food pass window.  And when we witnessed a girl pick food up off the counter (with no gloves on) and put it back on the plate, I really thought I was gonna be sick.   My advice, if your not staffed, and properly trained, then don't open.  And clearly they were not ready.  I can't promise I will or won't go back. My favorite is the smoke ranch location, so I may just keep driving there, or I will go back to the cracked egg.",

    "text": "Food --------      [Taste] 3 out of 5: (Chili Skillet ordered with Carrot Cake Pancakes)  Food tastes of a decently cooked meal that one can cook for themselves at home. It's honestly pretty bland and needed to be spiced up with a lot of Tabasco. By the looks and taste of the dish, the cooks are very inexperienced. The carrot cake pancakes were so overcooked they were brown and had the texture of a Frisbee. The chili tasted like canned chili, microwaved and put on top of the skillet. However, the food was  definitely edible enough to finish the entire meal.  [Presentation] 2 out of 5::  Very simple presentation on a plate. Nothing fancy. I'm used to way better presentation at competing, similarly priced breakfast restaurants. Again, it seems the cooks are very inexperienced, or have little direction or guidance from the owners.   Environment ------------------  [Seating] 2 out of 5:   Very uncomfortable seating arrangement. Tables are too close together and wobbly. The staff also doesn't seem to understand how to seat people. There are plenty of open tables but people are still waiting in line. Booths are pretty much non-existent. The existing booths are straight-up hard wood with no comfort cushions or padding.   [Concept] 4 out of 5:  You can't go wrong with a breakfast joint! People that love breakfast can be loyal patrons if you get the right people designing your restaurant atmosphere and concept. Pancakes, eggs, bacon, sausage, coffee, everyone loves these things.  [Service] 3 out of 5:  Service is OK. There doesn't seem to be any \"type\" that the restaurant hires. All really good restaurants don't hire everyone that puts in an application. Good restaurants hire the right person for the job and the concept of the restaurant.",

I like how Babystacks has a variety of not just your average eggs and bacon breakfast dishes.  They have filipino and hawaiian style dishes as well.  Their pancakes are fantastic!  I've had the regular, red velvet, and banana pancakes.  All were perfect and just the right size!  I've also had the Portuguese sausage with eggs and rice.  I like how they cut the sausages small and semi crispy (just how I like it) and it's not greasy.  I've also had the adobo fried rice omelet.  That dish can probably fit two people because it's so huge!  The only thing I didn't like was the garlic fried rice.  I wasn't a fan of the onions.  Other than that, this is an above average breakfast/lunch cafe!",

    "text": "I was told by a buddy, and fellow Yelper, Baby Stacks was the bomb and couldn't wait for the Centennial location to open so I could give it a whirl. We slipped in on a Sunday morning about 9:00am and were promptly greeted by smiling personnel, but were told it would be a few minutes. Although it was relatively busy, about half of the tables were empty. We were finally seated and were made to wait for beverage orders and then again made to wait before giving our breakfast order. The party seated after us and seated right next to us was taken care of first. I opted for the Chicken Fried Steak, which is listed as Country Fried Steak on the menu. It comes with eggs, like you would expect, but you can opt for garlic rice instead of potatoes. What? Garlic with breakfast? OMG! Awesome! The meat was cooked to perfection and the breading was fantastic. I would rank this among some of the best CFS in Vegas. I ordered the eggs over-easy and they were a little on the runny side, so keep that in mind when ordering your huevos. My meal came with a choice of bread, which included buttermilk pancakes, or an upgrade to any speciality pancake. I chose the bacon pancake. Bacon baked right in. Everything is better with bacon, right? The Mrs. opted for the red velvet pancakes with the cream cheese syrup. Wow! It was like dessert for breakfast. I am sure there are healthier choices on the menu, but if you are going to do it, you might as well do it up right. The food definitely lived up to the hype. The service, not so much. We'll just chaulk it up to working out the kinks during the first week. I will definitely be back and can't wait to see the looks on the faces of the Breakfast Club when they bite into the specialty pancake of their choosing.",

Blanca (who is not the owner, just a waitstaff) comes out and presents herself as the owner. They precede to tell me that they are not allowed to seat people even with 10 tables and the bar open. Know at this point I was less upset about the seating and more about the lies. They still refuse to give a phone number for the owner. What kind of business owner does not give a complaint number?",

No bc it's totally worth it. If I wanted fast food, I would go to a place specializing in fast food; just saying. Also, there is always take out if you don't want to wait and unlike some other breakfast places that shall remain nameless, they know exactly how to prepare a take out order; meaning they line styrofoam containers with tinfoil so my hot food doesn't sit directly on the styrofoam and cook to it which is a huge deal. So basically there is absolutely no reason you shouldn't be eating here. I'm going to end this now because it's Saturday so I'm off to have breakfast at Babystacks like always.",

Completely ridiculous that a restaurant which is only breakfast fare would limit their hours like that.

It's almost as if the chef cooked these pancakes with an iron and then flavored them in between his butt cheeks.  How is there a line outside this place???????",

So I guess I come here often. The service is always amazing, and of course the food is always great. I'm from Hawaii so whenever I eat here, it seriously is like I am back home.  My go to at home, and here in the mainland, has always been portuguese sausage, eggs, and rice. However, when I bring friends here I always tell them that anything and everything is good because I have never had anything here that I would not have again. Whether it's the pancakes, crepes, meals with rice, omelets, ANYTHING! Also make sure to try their strawberry lemonade. It is also delicious!",

    "text": "ZERO STARS is more appropriate in today's visit to this location. We were looking forward to this breakfast BUT got a server name SHAWNI who got to our table with a sour face with no good morning greetings whatsoever. You felt right away she's not friendly figured having a bad day already so I let it go.    She took our order with attitude, fine ... she punched our order on a kiosk annex to us literally few feet away and I had to make sure the order we got had the famous red velvet Babystacks pancakes. So I asked , \" Excuse me could you please check the pancakes we ordered are the red velvet.\" She didn't even come address us back to the table just her head turned and said with an attitude, \" you got the buttermilk so do you want the red velvet? With such contemptuous attitude ... really?!?!? and came back to our table flailing her hands to us and said \"next time you order you need to say you want the red velvet.\" Are you effing kidding me?! I let go of her attitude initially but this time I couldn't and shouldn't let this one go!!!! I had to ask, \" are you having a bad day? Cz you are not friendly at all from the get go? If we were first time customers and not know the difference it is your job to explain your menu & any upgrade.\" I had to ask for a Manager because she was just plain RUDE !!!!  Is this what this place represents? Are their employees not trained properly on simple customer service?!?!   A manager name Blanca came and tried to appease us, but it was too late, our morning already ruined what supposed to be a good birthday breakfast.  It was VERY DISAPPOINTING to get a HORRIBLE server because they are the forefront of the establishment and gives you a negative vibe of the place. Customer Service is so important and this SHAWNI so lacks of it and shame goes with the management as well to tolerate and keep people with no business waitressing if they don't want to serve then they shouldn't be in hospitality job!  CUSTOMER SERVICE breaks or makes a business and I highly suggest to the owner of this establishment to work on that and make it a priority to train their employees well.  NEEDLESS TO SAY WE WILL NEVER COME BACK TO THIS PLACE AND DEFINITELY MAKE SURE TO TELL PEOPLE & FRIENDS TO GO TO THE BUFFALO LOCATION instead who has excellent customer Service and much better tasting food than this Durango branch.",

This location in particular is my favorite, they're always the busiest but we always get the best service here. I like this location because they're always consistent. No matter what I order or who I get as a server I always leave full & satisfied. Since me & my bf regularly come here we tend to order the same thing each time. I usually get the Portuguese Sausage with two eggs or loco moco with garlic rice with red velvet pancakes. Most recently we did try the Marble Crunch pancakes. Haven't really eaten much off of the breakfast menu but their Turkey Avocado BLT with their french fries well done is something that I've enjoyed as well. I definitely prefer breakfast here over Denny's or iHop where I feel their food is overpriced and never that good. They also play \"feel good\" music and as busy as they always are we NEVER feel like we overstay our welcome which allows us to dine comfortably.",

    "text": "After hiking at Mount Charleston with Terri R. and Mel C., we decided to stop here for breakfast.  I didn't know there was a northwest outlet for Babystacks.  It proved to be a good place to go.  I have never had Spam until today.  When I looked at their menu and saw the Specialties section, the Spam Scramble popped out and I knew I had to order this.  Along with this, I opted for the two pancakes you can get instead of toast.  I ordered the Orange Creamsicle pancakes that come with orange syrup, whipped cream, and a small container of cream cheese icing.  Breakfast was great!  Spam is just like cubed lunch meat.  The Furikake mixed in gave the scramble some extra taste and the rice was good.  I didn't finish the rice because I wanted to have the healthier food--the pancakes with orange syrup and whipped cream.  As others have mentioned, this is a large restaurant and they have a large waiting area.  The three of us opted to eat at the counter where there was immediate seating.  Service was great.  My coffee was refilled several times and they were there to refill water glasses, too.  This is a good option for my hiking group to stop for a late breakfast/lunch while we're still hiking at Charleston.    This was a tasty breakfast made better because I enjoyed it with two friends.",

    "text": "Funny enough, we live right smack in between both Babystacks Cafe places.  We finally decided to take the jaunt in the opposite direction and visit the location on N. Durango!  Place is super busy for breakfast on the weekends.  Especially on a Sunday.  So church goers beware.  You may be in for a bit of a wait in your Sunday best.  Luckily for the wifey and I the wait was only about 10 minutes that day.  Place is nice and lively, and seems a bit more spacious than the other location on Buffalo.  Actually it seems a lot more spacious with the high ceilings and more tables.  I like the colors, actually makes me want to drink coffee and eat breakfast.  Menu here is just about the same as the other location.  Breakfast and lunch items galore!  Nothing in short supply.  I skipped my want of Rick's Adobo Fried Rice (hard for a Filipino) and went with something else out of the menu.  I chose the Ranchero Omelette ($9.25) - four egg omelette with an entire Ortega chile and chicken, topped with fresh green salsa, and pepper jack and cheddar cheese.  Also came with hash browns (love mine well done), and two buttermilk babystack pancakes (of course!).  Omelette was of good size, with lots of chile and chopped chicken on the inside.  The cheeses complimented the omelette well, and the green salsa gave it a nice added kick (but not too hot).  I enjoyed it a lot.  The hash browns were standard, good and cooked how I like.  I however love to drown mine in pepper, ketchup, and lots of Tabasco.  Yum.  The babystack pancakes?  Good to the last bite.  I dunno what it is about their babystack batter, but it's a keeper.  Nice, hot, fluffy (not you Gabriel Iglesias), not doughy or rubbery, perfect with some maple syrup.  All in all a great breakfast for me.  The wifey had the Mexican Skillet ($9.95) - flat top potatoes with marinated carnitas and jalapenos, with pepper jack cheese, topped with two eggs over-easy, and a side of fresh pico de gallo, and sour cream.  Wifey also opted for two buttermilk babystack pancakes.  She said her dish was good, but there was a bit too much jalapeno in her skillet making it a little spicy for her liking.  The pico de gallo also had more onion than tomato.  Other than that she enjoyed it, and gave thumbs up to the babystack pancakes.  I like Babystacks Cafe for breakfast and will keep coming here for their morning delights.  Service here is great, our server was quick, very attentive, and kept our cups full.  Can't ask for anything more, especially during the early morning rush.  Eat!  Next time it will be Rick's Adobo Fried Rice.  Or maybe not.",

    "text": "I went to this place because of the amazing reviews. I was HIGHLY Disappointed .. First I ordered bacon and eggs ; eggs, scrambled with h cheese. The bacon was half cooked ( I guess u need to ask for crispy bacon to get it fully cooked). I asked for scrambled eggs with cheese, and I got chopped eggs with a slice of cheese on top. Excuse me but I believe when you ask for scramble eggs with cheeses, it suppose to come out SCRAMBLED with CHEESE in it smh. My friend ordered corn beef hash with potatoes on thee side, and her potatoes was frozen in the inside.   With the negative comes the positive and the ONLY positive I can say is ..  I ordered the cinnamon bun pancakes and I would have to say it's was the best thing out of the whole order.  I will not be going back to baby stacks. The reviews really let me down this time",

Or have a to-go menu?  I was sent over to Babystacks via a friend in the area. I had the red velvet pancakes with my eggs and hashbrowns. They were to die for.  Like dessert and heaven made a baby.  I can't remember what my mom and husband ate, but we all left very happy.  I'll be back, but on a Monday morning. Figure out how to improve traffic so locals can eat here on the weekend, too!",

We had to wait 20 minutes and there were quite a few empty tables and a couple bar seats available. I asked if we could sit at the bar and we were immediately seated before other customers that were already waiting.   I ordered an omelette and my wife some eggs Benedict. The plates came and didn't look like anything special. For some reason my plate had a lone mushroom on it, and I didn't even order mushrooms in my omelette. My wife's plate could have used more sauce and the muffin was a little burnt.   Overall, the place is not bad but is not anything special. I don't see myself going back unless I get a BOGO, but I don't see them putting any deals out.",

I decided today that I was going to do that and I called. The girl out me on hold for 8 minutes (I have a lot of patience).. I decided to just drive there and make an order since I had some shopping to do and I could swing by and just pick up my order. I walk in through the door and the girl asked if she could help, I told her I was the person they put on hold for 8 mins. I told her I wanted to make a take out order. She then said \"we not doing take out right now.. Take out orders are on hold right now..\" Ok, I get you're busy and you're cooks can't keep up but you could've said it to me when I called instead of keeping me on hold and waste my time.. Smh. I won't be eating here anymore nor ordering. Looks like I will find a new place. They really need to make this place bigger and hire more people. Or go find a new spot that's bigger that can handle all their guests.",

The service was just ok. server was not every attentive, and we had to continue to ask for refills. The last thing that I would mention is this place needs to evaluate the hours of operation.

As people have already mentioned, it's always packed here so we always order food to go. Maybe I don't understand what exactly a tip is for but last time I checked a tip is for when you are being seated,  served/waited on... When paying at the counter they give you a tab to fill out for the tip before they proceed with the transaction... At that point I cross out the tip(because I don't feel I have a reason to leave tip due to not being seated and served) and return the receipt to the person at the register. No matter who I am dealing with I ALWAYS get nasty or disturbed looks when I don't leave a tip... Unless the tip is going to the cooks I honestly don't feel as I should be leaving a tip for the person who bagged my food or the cashier.  Maybe the process should be alerted or the workers at the front counter should be talked to about putting on a better face when they are displeased.",

Waiter came over, he was really sweet and funny, but our food came out and it was a train wreck! My friend ordered crispy bacon and it came out soggy, my husbands egg Benedict came out and the biscuits were soggy so we asked for new ones and those were soggy too, his breakfast was so bad he didn't even want to finish it. I got the country fried steak breakfast and I enjoyed it up until my husband decided he wanted to eat the eggs, I don't like eggs, he was so excited and hungry to eat them, he got them all dressed up and ready to eat and then when he went to go take a bite there is a whole corner of a plastic cut off in the eggs.  We ask for a manager and they came over and said that they had no idea where the plastic came from because all their stuff is organic and not packaged, which is bull crap, because when I walked in I could see the shelves with the cans in the back in the kitchen. And I find it disturbing that a manager would say that they have no idea where it came from instead of making us as guests feel comfortable.  It was a bad experience, it was disgusting, we will never go back there.",

I substituted the Cookies & Cream Pancakes: Chocolate Batter with Oreo, Whipped Cream, Icing, Cream Cheese Syrup & more Oreo. These were delicious! But I love Oreo...pretty much anything....so I am a little bias :P  Eva tried the Red Velvet Pancakes: Whipped Cream, Chocolate Crumbles & Cream Cheese Syrup. Good as always...probably one of the reasons why they got famous!  My only complaint about this location is the lack of presentation/love put into the plating.

It's like any other diner breakfast spot. I don't see anything extremely special about it. The pancakes were alright. Big I guess. Meh. The service is also not the greatest the two times I came.",

    "text": "Food: I should have stuck with the pancakes. I am visiting from Hawaii and was a little home sick so I wanted to try the loco moco. First off I was a little disappointed that they couldn't sub fried rice for a small up charge but rather only could do garlic rice (over garlicked) or buy the $10 adobo fried rice on the side. This is something any L&L, big city diner, loco moco shop does easily. The gravy too tasted a little... Boxed. The coffee tasted distinctly plasticky mixed with that airplane coffee taste of bad water, and the sugar didn't make it any better. But I will admit this is my fault for ordering something Hawaiian in Las Vegas. My husband got the white chocolate macadamia nut pancakes and gobbled them up so those were good.   -stick to pancakes   Ambiance: the staff was very nice and smiley, a little inattentive but functional. The decor is a little sparse but the music was nice!   Overall: good place to get breakfast if you want traditional breakfast foods, but they have some work to do on their Hawaiian local specialities.",

It's obviously a busy location, but the process for checking in, waiting, being seated, waiting and then waiting even more....was too much.  The icing on the cake....when someone finally asked how things were....as we are paying on the way out.....when we said it wasn't good and for our first time here we were disappointed....the guy taking our money said nothing!  Not even a sorry about that, yeah today was really busy but give us another try, or even let me see if my managers available???  Nothing....  My Yelp recommendation DON'T try this location!",

We then had to ask 4 times for coffee refills which took about 10 minutes each time to get. That's another 40 min. I don't want to EVER have to ask. \"Our\" waiter never actually refilled it. Mikey was too busy. Another female waitress overheard us complaining and she refilled it once. One of the meals that came out was cold. I mean cold... The cheese wasn't even trying to melt. It was not good. We sent it back with little apology from our \"waiter.\"  I had to ask for a coke refill. Again why am I having to do this? We then asked for butter for the pancakes. I swear to you 7 minutes passes and he comes back and says, \"oh I forgot the butter, do you still want it?\" No. No. No. Screw this we are done.  As we paid and the young man asked if it was ok and we said no it was actually a bad experience for our first time there. He simply took our money and  never looked up. That's crap in my opinion. You just lost a potential customer for the duration of our vegas living.  The \"manager\" looked just as lost as the rest if the staff while she was taking names to be seated and not back running the kitchen and doing quality assurance checks. What a crock. I chose not to say anything to her because I felt like that was a moot point as well.  On a side note there is only one restroom for the males and one for the females. We used the men's once because it stupid to stand in line that long for the women's. This place is huge and it's not equipped to handle the volume.",

I've been to their original location on a few occasions with this being my first one at this one. Good taste the same as the other location.    I usually go with the red velvet pancakes and the adobo omelette. Red velvet pancakes to be honest are ok. Pancake by itself is a bit bland to me but when you mix it with the topping, it makes it taste much, much better.   A lot of people love the adobo omelette as well. It's not bad. It satisfies a craving for some who get that.  Other than that, I give this place an A-Ok. Won't be the last time I visit.",

First things first they do not take reservations here and they will not seat u if you whole party is not present. That being said the wait to get a table here is crazy. We were in on a Saturday morning and the wait time was 30m to an hour for a breakfast joint!!!! We were seated conceded to taking seats at the counter because we had waited 45m and did not want to wait longer for a table.   Waitress at the counter was nice enough but nothing special service wise.  I ordered the banana pudding pancakes with a side of bacon and my friend ordered the breakfast special. The prices were reasonable but I didn't like that the syrups were an extra cost (wth- where they do that at?) but since I had an embellished pancake I did not need syrup. (Also note no sides are included with the specialty pancakes.)   Overall the pancakes were really good and the bacon was cook nice and crispy. I do however feel that the pancakes were kind of smallish but still filling. I think the specialty pancake options they have are very original like red velvet, Nutella, various fruit flavors so I would like to go back and try some of the other flavors. Not yet a favorite place of mine but it could happen. I would definitely come back and I think I would recommend to others.",

It's a small homey breakfast location with a wide range of pancakes but since I'm not a pancake person myself and I've been on a skillet kick for a while me and my boyfriend both got the Mexican skillet  it contains carnitas, potatoes, pepper jack cheese, jalapenos, sour cream, pico de Gallo and it wouldn't be a skillet with out eggs and my daughter got the kids French toast it comes with potatoes on the side, I wanted to substitute the potatoes for bacon because my daughter really wanted bacon but unfortunately they couldn't so I had to order her a side of bacon and strawberry's(she really wanted strawberry on her French toast) both side being about $3 each besides that most pricing is reasonable. I always enjoy the food here and usually receive great customer service but there a very popular spot so they get really busy and I don't like how the tables are all crammed together so close and in this particular visit they decided to seat us on a bar area which was fine but then I realized there's no elbow space which makes it uncomfortable to eat but all and all it's a good place to try out I definitely will be coming back here again",

I  had the spam and eggs the first time, so good. Then I discovered the chili moco, substitute spam. OH. MY GOD. It is the only thing I order now. It's that good. GET IT!! I love that you can also upgrade your side of pancakes to one of their Babystacks. I have had their blueberry, banana cream pie, red velvet, Cinnabon, and cookies and cream. Still working. My way through the rest lol. My must try Babystacks are for sure the Cinnabon and the cookies and cream. You don't even need  he side of syrup they send. Just delicious.",

    "text": "I love babystacks I always go to the original location in Summerlin they have the best service there and should've just gone there instead. Never coming back to this location again after our experience . Yes, there's a lot of people, it's busy... BUT that doesn't give you an excuse to be rude and inattentive to your customers. Our server took 15 min to get us a drink and another five to get our orders... Once he did get our orders all of our orders were incorrect! A simple sorry about that would've sufficed BUT he managed to say are you sure you didn't order that?.... Like BRO... I ordered Portuguese sausage, rice, over medium eggs, with pancakes .... and he gave me the sausage, seasoned potatoes,scrambled eggs and toast... instead of apologizing he was just like so you changed your mind on the toast..? NO. I never ordered it.. and he was telling me that wasn't what he wrote down.. Well OBVIOUSLY you were not paying attention and didn't care much for good service...he apologizes after hearing me make a comment about him claiming we ordered what he wrote. To put the cherry on top of this horrific service he managed to put 3 drinks that we didn't order on the bill...... The cashier asks us if we wanted to add tip ... the answer is a big NO. I'm usually a good tipper but with that service he was lucky we didn't walk out... Amazing food won't keep customers coming back if your service is horrible and unprofessional. I did not expect a 5 star dining experience here but I also did expect attentiveness, and a little bit of courtesy.... SMH.",

A word to the wise, come early and come hungry! There will be a wait but it's worth it. Better than the cracked egg, the egg & I, egg works...basically anyplace with the word egg in it. Lol! (IMO anyway) :p   Friendly staff and lots of Hawaiian inspired dishes. I just love the aloha vibe here which makes sense since Vegas is the 9th island. Zippy's chili (If you've been to HI before then you already know what I'm taking about), portuguese sausage with garlic rice, macadamia pancakes, spam & eggs, adobo fried rice omelette, and the list goes on. It's easy to see why baby stacks stands out from the pack. So Ono!   Another notable mention are the red velvet pancakes. But my all time favorite are the bananas foster pancakes. OMG!!! Ahhh-mazing!",

My boyfriend and I aren't really pancake people (we prefer savory breakfasts) and had ordered the corned beef hash and the adobo fried rice. I felt like it would have been an injustice to come to babystacks and not try their pancakes, so I asked our server for their most popular pancakes and decided to get the strawberry pancakes to go with my corned beef hash.  I wasn't expecting to really like the pancakes since I normally don't. BUT I ATE ALL OF MY PANCAKES. IT WAS DELICIOUS. It came with fresh cream and strawberries and this strawberry sauce that was addictive. I almost forgot all about my corned beef hash because all I wanted to do was keep eating the pancakes. The corned beef hash was perfect, it had a nice crisp to it and some softness in the middle. I love eating it together where I'm able to get corned beef hash, a little runny yolk, and potatoes all in one spoonful.   My boyfriend got the adobo fried rice which was served in an omelett. I've never seen that before so I thought it was really creative. It was well-seasoned and yummy.  For a place that we randomly picked, I was thoroughly impressed and we enjoyed everything we ordered. I'm honestly still thinking about those strawberry pancakes.",

Finally order drinks and didn't even  bring lemon for the water which we requested when ordered when I asked the pastor for straws and lemon she rolled her eyes as if I was putting her out! About five minutes later I then again asked for a server instead of the server who I asked to take our order she went for 10 minutes looking for the server instead of just easily taking our order which made no sense to me... finally the server came apologized took our order and then proceeded to go take someone else's order ask the people next to us if they needed anything else grabbed them to go boxes and started talking to another customer!!! At this point we were completely over it absolutely horrible customer service I made sure to let the manager now on the way out and she said she would address it but didn't seem to care at the time to take care of it!!! My husband and myself eat almost every meal out and service for us is huge without it we will avoid establishments like the plague!!!

Now there's 7 empty tables and I'm going on 20 minutes! My patients are wearing thin! I hope the food is good! Did I mention it's 1039am on Monday morning? So far we are one star and it would be less if it was an option! We're at 9 clean empty tables! The cashier is the hostess she's checking people out and not seating people! Successful place could for sure afford some lackey at 9 bucks an hour to seat people at empty tables! Yeah 33 minutes were sitting! Wait",

Our waitress Allison was quick to take our drink order and our food was served rather fast. I ordered the breakfast burrito with Portuguese sausage which was excellent. We will definitely return to try other items on the menu.",

    "text": "This is my favorite breakfast place in the entire world!!  Service here is hit or miss.  But the food here is always HIT!  I have been a fan since previously known as Babycakes.  Babystacks is known for their delicious red velvet pancakes!  They are served with mini chocolate chips, whipped cream, and a cream cheese syrup.  Delicious!!  After coming here for several years, I have tried almost all the pancakes.  Cookies n cream, chocolate chip, banana cream pie, red velvet, hazelnut, honey wheat, s'mores, white chocolate macadamia (surprisingly my least favorite).  My favorites are red velvet and hazelnut.  Their seasoned potatoes are to die for!!  Absolutely delicious.  I always get a side of country gravy with them, and dip my potatoes in it.  Yuuuummm!  I love sourdough toast, and am so happy this place has real sourdough.  A lot of places say they have sourdough and serve you white.  Although their menu says the bacon is crispy, if you like it well-done, make sure you tell them (because you may or may not get it crispy).  One of my only complaints!    There is usually a wait, especially on the weekends.  The least busy times I have found are around 2 PM.  Then you can get in and out of there in half an hour.  If you go when it's busy, expect a 20-30 minute wait.  So worth it though!",

I even ordered the same thing both times, egg whites, bacon, small stacks of buttermilk pancakes and side of fruit. I know it's not really fruit season so I don't blame them that the fruit was wilty and wasn't flavorful. This won't be my last time here. It will be on my list of must-dos when I visit Vegas. The service was just as good as the food. No matter how early we got there, once was 9:15am, the other was 7:50am, they were still so chipper and happy to be working there. When people love their job and are happy, it makes everything that much better. The next time I visit, I will gladly change up my order and try something new. The ambiance of this place is so warm and homey as well. From the pictures on the wall to the colors they close. All of it was great!",

    "text": "Been going to babystacks for years and it hits the spot. Here are a few tips.  1. Weekends are always busy. You will wait. If you have a large party or small party you will wait. Make sure everyone in your party is there or you will not be seated and you will wait. Once you're seated service is usually fast 2. Best time to come is a tues-thurs when school is in session. So a Tuesday in may is perfect and they will actually sit an incomplete party when they are empty 3. Get the pancakes. This is what they are known for. Red velvet is amazing but you may need insulin after. So is their bananas foster 4. Coffee isn't the best here, pretty weak tasting, but maybe you're into that. But it's always hot and they're usually really good at refills 5. Food doesn't come out piping hot. Usually just warm. For a while I was turned off by this, but number 3 gives you the reason why we go here. But hey at least they're consistent 6. I love that they have both hash browns and potatoes as options 7. They try to move you in and out of the place quick so if you come on a busy time, don't expect to just hangout after you're done eating.",

It's served with this thick glaze that you pour over it in lieu of regular syrup. Oh my!  It doesn't get much better than that!!    The coffee was perfect with the pancakes. The only reason I didn't give it more stars is the service was a little lacking. They didn't seem to be all that busy but it took a while to get out order and the coffee refills didn't come around as much as I would have liked. I've been there a couple of times on different days of the week so I'm not sure why the service was just so so. I'll tell you what though, the red velvet pancakes makes it worth your wait!

    "text": "I have eaten here a total of 2 times (and almost a 3rd if I had of stayed today) each time I have came with friends or family the taste and quality of the food has been great. The proportion sizes were nice for the price asked and the restaurant has always smelled great from the good food.   The complaint I have is each time there has been long wait times you should practically eat before you come. They say right from the start 30 mins to 45 min wait (which is some how a secrete code for an hour plus). I heard great reviews so each time I waited but it always left me with a tinge of angst before eating there.   The last and final straw for me was today when I was told the 30 to 45 min story from the hostess who to me makes a poor hostess (absolute horrible attitude for paying customers willing to wait an hour) after I wait the entire 45 minutes (I was counting). I asked how much longer before I'm seated (party of 3). She said there are 2 people in front of me.   After 6 parties are seated before me including 3 different parties of 3 I go to ask what gives. She sharply replies your coming up, internally my wheels are moving and I'm resistant to let this go! I ask her to explain what makes the other parties of 3 any different? She replies out of frustration and ask do I want to put a high chair at a bar.   Even if that is the case it has been an hour, as my family was being seated we looked at each other and thought we can not spend our money here today or any other day for that matter. Considering we waited an hour to eat just to  leave is a good indication of our level of frustration. Perhaps the hostess should go apply at the post office or DMV where you are not required nor expected to have a bearing on good customer service.   Sunday is a very relaxing day that I enjoy and I can not spend it at a place that had bad service and good food or vice versa for that matter. I'll pay extra for both they fall short here in the service and wait times.  But I can not discredit the food (every time I have eaten here was delicious) as it is the only reason for the 2 stars.",

First time this place opened some of the food they served wasn't even seasoned or ready to be served. Please thaw your frozen food properly before putting them in customers takeout.   Second time only reason I had to order from here was so I don't have to drive 25 mins to get the stuff to make my own at home. Let me tell you something put the takeout items in a bag so your customer can take it not placing aplastic bag in front me to put the food in the bag after paying for it. You staff was watching put my food in my own bag and didn't do anything. This is so petty but so important.   Food is isn't amazing it is mediocre and overpriced food that I wouldn't eat unless I have no choice.    It gets worst every time",

I asked for milk for our coffee and was charged $2.25 for it; that's definitely a first. I asked the cashier if the policy was to charge for milk for coffee. I was told no, the server must not have understood; she continued to charge me instead of correcting it or asking a manager for assistance.  We also asked if a short stack of pancakes could be made into silver dollar sized (kid sized) pancakes. Not for extra pancakes, syrup, etc. Sure, but it's $2 extra. For the exact same amount of batter on the same exact plate. WTF?  Check your bill carefully.",

    "text": "Babystacks is an awesome breakfast/brunch option if you're on the NW side of town.  They have a huge variety of pancake choices.  Many of them super unique and all of them delicious.  I've had the carrot cake (tastes like carrot cake), banana cream (definitely my favorite!), orange creamsicle (super orangey tasting), and the cookies and cream (tastes like it sounds!).    I appreciate that they have Hawaiian/Filipino breakfast choices too.  Not every place has spam or my fav, the adobo fried rice.  The adobo fried rice, which is basically an omelet, is reallllly good here - super packed with lots of meat and its even better when you upgrade to the garlic fried rice.    My only qualm about this place is that service is not exactly top notch.  Servers are friendly enough, but not very attentive.  We've gone where service was soooooo sloooooow and we've gone when service was a normal speed.  Both times the place wasn't terribly crowded.  That part can be pretty hit or miss I guess.    Either way, the food is great so give it a try and judge for yourself!",

    "text": "I'm still trying to figure out the hype. This was our second time going and my second time being less than satisfied.   Their unique-ness comes from their huge variety of pancakes (everything from savory, like bacon pancakes to sweet, like Nutella pancakes, bananas foster, etc).   The good: The honey French toast was amazing! Homemade whipped cream, huge slices. Delicious. My husband really liked the bananas foster pancakes, the skillet meal, and the huevos rancheros (ordered over the two trips). The sausage patties & links were both good, though I'd only order the patties again.   The okay: The Nutella crepes I ordered were fine, but I didn't think anything special.   The disappointing: Besides being pretty pricey for such a small, home style establishment (the menu is almost a la carte style), the service was definitely lacking. If I'm going to pay $25+ for a breakfast meal for two people, I expect either a lot of food (enough to be VERY filling or leftovers) OR great customer service OR even absolutely fantastic food. This place had none of the above. The entire time we ate, the previous tables' tip was at the table. We reminded the server SEVERAL times to tell the other server. It was STILL there when we left. Unprofessional. The bacon pancakes were disappointing. They boast pancakes filled with bacon. More like, a few bacon crumbs on top and maybe one or two \"inside\" the pancake (laying in the middle of two).   I don't think we'll be back anytime soon.",

The waiter took the pancakes and came back with my skillet and once i started to enjoy my food they bought out me a fresh order of pancakes to only cut in them and have the same thing happen again the pancakes were uncooked. I couldnt even eat my skillet because my whole stomach was turned after being served my favorite thing about babystacks eating pancakes and what they r well known for.",

    "text": "We have been to one of the Babystacks on Buffalo before and loved it. We plan on going back to that one should we go to Babystacks again.  My boyfriend, son, and I came in for a late breakfast on Thursday. There were people there, but plenty of open tables. Once seated, we ordered drinks from the server while we looked over the menu. She asked if we were ready to order, but I wasn't and asked for another minute. She left and we did not see her again for at least 10 minutes. Fair enough though, I did ask for more time and that's what we got.  We placed our order ; I got the Mexican skillet with bananas foster pancakes, my son ordered bacon and eggs with Rocky Road pancakes, the bf ordered a veggie omelette and strawberry pancakes. After another kinda long wait, out came my pancakes, my bf's pancakes and my son's bacon and eggs. Then another wait. It wasn't too bad for me. I ate half my pancakes before the rest of my food came to the table, but my boyfriend likes to eat his pancakes for \"dessert\". That's just the way the man eats. So my skillet finally comes, my son's pancakes come. The server says to my bf, \"your omelette will be out in a minute\". Fine. Well, she didn't come back with his food until my son and I were about done eating. She just sets it down with a, \"Sorry\". So he scarfed it down since he was starving and then ate his cold pancakes while we waited for him.  My bf and I have both been servers before so we're pretty understanding of kitchen mishaps and we tend to tip generously, but the way she handled this was all wrong. She could have offered some form of explanation so he would know he should eat his pancakes instead of saying it will be out in a minute. She also should have offered a discount or something for the inconvenience of not bringing his food until we were done. So the 2 stars are strictly for the food which was very good. Service needs some work.",
