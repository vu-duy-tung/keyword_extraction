The lunch combos all run under $10 and come with rice, miso soup, salad, tempura (shrimp/vegetable), and an entree.  My favorite is their spicy tuna bowl...but honestly everything tastes good here.  Learned a little something that this is a sister restaurant to Naked Fish.",

A must try too is their eggplant with spicy miso meat... an all time favorite for me.   The highlight of our dinner all the time is the evil chocolate fondant cake with vanilla ice cream...The cause of my ever growing muffin top.   See you Kyara next month!",

    "text": "Arrived late last night to vegas and wanted to check Kyara based on the 4.5 star rating.    If you've lived in LA or Orange County long enough you've probably tried or heard of the standard izakaya restaurants: Hondaya, Kappo, and the likes.    I'm fairly generous with my scores but sadly, I think Kyara is far from par.  Perhaps it was the chicken karaage that was majority fried fat.  Perhaps it was the Agedashi Tofu that was undercooked.  OR perhaps it was the outrageously overpriced $4.5 price of a 10oz. glass of  asahi beer.   Or Perhaps it was our late night check in at 1AM.  Either way, if you've lived in LA long enough, chances are you've had better.  Steer clear.   For you vegas locals, uhm...if you like it, rock on!",

    "text": "Do try this if you like Japanese Izakaya. If you have friends who are afraid of raw fish, izakayas are a good place to grab a drink, get a bit of sushi and still have lots of cooked items on the menu. This place is bit more formal than some Izakaya restaurants, and the items seem a bit smaller and a bit more pricy than some izakayas. But you are paying for good service and quality food. Arrived at 5:05 on a Saturday. Promptly greeted and seated. Drinks and appetizers came right away while we compiled our list of small plates from the large menu. Ordered the big eye tuna sashimi, salmon sashimi, yakitori (grilled chicken skewers) grilled beef tongue, donburi and chicken karage (seasoned fried chicken tenders) and some other rice bowls. A few notable items for our order: The tuna sashimi was great and served over ice (Gaijin friendly) which I appreciated as it made it seem market fresh. I should mention, the size of the sashimi pieces are about half what you would find in Japan, LA or NY but this is the middle of the desert, a feat of modern technology getting fresh fish here. The big eye tuna sashimi was well worth the price. The beef tongue was not great, but perhaps this is subjective, for me it always seems just OK. Loved the yakitori (grilled chicken skewers) and the karage (seasoned fried chicken). We had the macha waffle ala-mode (green tea flavored waffle with a scoop of vanilla ice cream) comes with real maple syrup and warm butter. This place works well for dates, small groups or if you just want more quite and relaxed izakaya experience.",

They have several bowls (Don) for $5.99 (I think) and combination plate options ($8.99) that come with tempura, rice, salad, miso soup, and the main dish.   I was in the mood for some fish so I had spicy tuna Don combo, and I was impressed with the quality of this combo set.   Salad with separate Japanese style dressing was excellent, miso soup was properly done, spicy tuna bowl and excellent, and I was especially happy with the quality of tempura, where many pseudo japanese restaurants tend to butcher.    At $8.99 for this quality combo, I'm definitely coming back to try a few different variations.",

We order jalepeno popper; didnt like it, nothing was wrong with it, it was just a weird type of food. Chuwanmushi was great, excellent flavor and good portion of seafood. We had the motsuni, again, great taste and flavor.   Now the dessert. we ordered the green tea waffle and affogato green tea. the affogato was the best. I would recommend that than the waffle.

We ate as many things on the menu we could fit in our bellies. I don't even remember what half the stuff was called, after picking some stuff we pretty much threw darts at the menu and ordered. We weren't disappointed in any of it. The Deep Fried Mountain Potato was a wonderful surprise, Japanese french fries! The Tuna Carpaccio was yummy, it melted in my mouth like butter. The Yuzu Chili Salmon was good, but not the star. The Albacore with Jalapeno was strange but good. Chicken Skewers and Chicken Garlic Ponzu was good for something \"normal\". As well as the Deep Fried Garlic Potatoes...delicious, anyone can eat at this place, don't be scared. Kaisen Chawanmushi was good, I've never had it before, my mind kept wanting it to be sweet. Mussels in a delicious tomato sauce, very tender...and I usually don't eat mussles. We got some kind of skewered Green Peppers, we thought they'd be hot, but they weren't. Tasty. A whole fried fish, not sure what kind, but we devoured it as ladylike as possible (not)...it was yummy. Some sort of grated potato dish with cheese in a skillet, very good, a little salty, but it reminded me of a potato pancake/bleenie/latkes. We tried to order the chicken skin, but they didn't have anymore (it was around 7 on a weekday). We also tried to get the Shark Cartilage but they said it was out of season:( Just another reason to keep going back! I think I got it all, can't wait to try some more!",

The restaurant is a little small but they accept reservations if you call ahead. The only reason I did not give 5 starts is because the cooks don't wear gloves.

Upon entry, you are in a little room, with a waiting area. Passed that, will be the centralized bar and kitchen. To the right and left, are sectioned rooms with a few tables in each. Decor was, i guess traditional japanese? Lots of wooden accents and decor.   Due to the lack of available small tables, we were seated at the bar.   Their lunch  menu is pretty decent sized and priced really well ranging around $6 for lunch bowls, $7 for noodle, and $10 for combinations.   Spicy Salmon Bowl (Combination with Rice, Soup, Salad, and Tempura) - $9.95 - For this combination, you get a small bowl of rice, topped with chopped spicy salmon mixed with masago (that was a surprise to me. adds a nice texture !). Soup is a standard bowl of miso soup. Small salad with dressing on the side (nice little detail for those who prefer less or more dressing, can be adjusted themselves). The tempura size was a little surprising. If anything, this is a full order of tempura. 2 shrimps, and a few veggies. For the amount of food you get at the price of $9.95, its a great deal if you are in the area.   I'm actually craving for this while i write this review... so sad ! its 4:45am too !",

Many of the menu items appealed to me but the prices discouraged me from ordering. I also didn't like that the menu items were in Japanese so I couldn't really comprehend what the items were. We wanted to order a couple items that were on the specials menu but they were all sold out. So it would've been nice if we would've known that before ordering because the specials were the majority of what I wanted to try. Ended up only getting a couple items. Kim chi it was ok nothing special. The beef tongue was kinda chewy and not tender like other places. The mushrooms were good and you could taste the grill flavor. They do have a lot of menu items but I probably won't be back for more.",

One day my skewers can be all oily fat with little to no meat and my takoyaki burnt around the edges and the list goes on with various misgivings... Other days I come in, and the food is just spot on perfect!   What keeps me coming back are three things.   Ika butter IKA BUTTER I K A  B U T T E R  Just so so good! I love to buy a salmon bowl along with my ika butter and use the left over sauce as an extra flavor in my bowl. It works wonders.   Then there's the occasional diced beef steak and Kurobuta sausage which is always a winner too.   Kyara Japanese Tapas, no matter how inconsistent their meals, always keeps me coming back for its convenience. It's in the Southwest area, one of the only good restaurants open late at night, and has a poppin happy hour special!  A great spot to grab some drinks with coworkers after a long day's work, eat your heart out, and have fun.",

    "text": "Kyara has been on my to try list for awhile and tonight was the night I got the chance to go.  Having read many of the reviews from friends, I had some good tips to follow when dining here.  I sat at the sushi bar a place I like because it's always fun to watch the chefs working their magic and you see a kitchen at work.  I started by ordering three items, Gobo chips (fried burdock root), Iko Geso Age (deep fried squid tentacles), and Enoki with bacon (thin Japanese mushrooms wrapped in bacon and grilled on a skewer.)    The Gobo chips reminded me of very thin French fries with a bit different texture and a different flavor.  It's the root of the burdock so it has some of the flavor from where it grew.  The seasoning on the Gobo was excellent.  Iko Geso Age, deep fried squid tentacles, were uniformly cooked and seasoned with some salt.  The squid was very flavorful and almost every bite was tender.  Next was the enoki with bacon.  I think most people have seen enoki, either on TV or in the produce section of a market.  Enoki is a very thin stemmed mushroom, white in color, and in this preparation, a number of the mushrooms are gathered together something like a sheaf of wheat and carefully held together by being wrapped by the bacon and placed on a skewer.  It's then grilled.  It is a very tasty dish!  This is what I like about tapas style restaurants, I've eaten three dishes, well actually four, and I still have room to try one more thing.  I asked about their mountain potato on a hot plate.  One of the chefs explained to me that it might not be pleasant to my palate that it was slimy and it had a taste that you either loved or hated at first bite.  He also said the dish was too much for one person in size.  OK, next time I go, I have to go with a group of Yelp friends.  Instead, I ordered a butabara (pork belly)  skewer with salt.  They'll do it unsalted, salted, or with salt on the side.  What tasty pork!  This is reason to return although there' still so much to explore on the menu.  I mention and extra dish but didn't explain it.  When you check in on Yelp, it brings up a screen that gives you a free appetizer.  It was small and had some fish and other items.  It was a good starter and a nice perk for a check in.  Dinner wouldn't be complete without dessert.  I've had my share of chocolate recently, so I went with the green tea waffle dessert.  You get two waffles, vanilla ice cream, and two small containers--one with warm honey and one with melted butter.  I used a bit of the butter and only a small amount of the honey.  The dessert was very good.  And as one person's review stated, it is very filling.  Service was great.  I was there when Kyara opened so there wasn't a crowd there.  I was served twice by one of two servers and I received some of the other dishes over the bar from one of the chefs.  They allowed me to stand and peer over the side of the counter so I could see them making sushi and one of the chefs was trying a new dressing for a salad.  Dinner was very tasty, service was excellent, and I will be back.",

But it's hard to find such a well executed restaurant like Kyara you be leaving happy if anything. I was really impressed with the experience as soon as I stepped in. The server grabs the attention of the chefs and they all greet you with a warm 'irasshaimase' that doesn't sound so robotic for once. If you sit by the inside tables, there are overhead lights dimly lit which really gives off that snazzy after-hours feel. Do you want to make it a relaxed meal before you return home or is it a pre-game spot before your next destination? You decide. Either way, they set up that mood very well. Along with some J-POP playing on their radio, they put you in the zone for a good bite and drink.  The fried shrimp and chicken-skin skewers were some of my favorites. The Philadelphia Roll was simply amazing.. Why can't more restaurants pack cream cheese like that? There is so much to eat from the tapas menu one visit didn't do me justice.  I've been meaning to buy some of my buddies a meal+round and this is the perfect place.",

    "text": "Ate here about a year ago and really enjoyed it.  Was looking forward to returning and checked up for recent reviews on yelp (which were mostly favorable).  Unfortunately, I was extremely disappointed by my visit this past Friday night (6/21).  First of all we made to wait approx 15 minutes for a table when there were clearly several tables available.  Then another 10 minutes+ for someone to take our drink order.  Another 15 minutes for someone to take our food order, and only after I got up and walked around the restaurant to find a server.  Another 10+ minute wait for our first dish to arrive - miso soup; which I'm sure could have been served much quicker.  Fortunately, after that, the rest of our dishes did arrive in a more timely manner.  But then...it was time for the BILL!  After waiting 10+ minutes after our last dishes were removed, I finally had to ASK for the check and was told \"our computer is down and it should be back up in 5 minutes\".  I heard this server say the same thing to another table but that was when we first walked in, over an hour ago.  Now here is the best part of the story! 15 more minutes of waiting for the bill and  then the server brings us some free ice cream for our wait.  After we finish the complimentary dessert and sit around for another 15 minutes...I have to get up and find somebody to ask for my bill AGAIN.  I am told the computer is down and they can't give it to me - we were actually being held hostage by the restaurant!  How many timers does one have to ask for a check before you can just get up and walk out?  What if we had a show or movie to catch?  Could we have just walked out?  In the end I had asked FOUR times for a check and waited more than 45 minutes to receive it.  That is just TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE under any circumstances!",

The grilled fish was very tasty.  Grilled beef and chicken were very flavorful.  The mushroom with wrapped bacon was out of this world.  The grilled said was a must.  I went with a group of people, so I had a chance to try so many different dishes.  No disappointment at all.  Keep in mind these are tapas plates, so the portions are individual, very small. I'm going to come back with a different group of people.  Strongly recommended",

    "text": "I came here around 12:45-12:50 they close around 2 but basically I waited about an hour just to be seated and it took about 30-40 mins just to get my food and that is ridiculous! When I was trying to get there way before closing just so I can quickly get a meal in and get out asap the waiter seemed kinda rude and impatient, we were supposed to write our order on this paper but it was my first time here so I asked if I can just order and him write it down? And the guy seemed irritated or frustrated and we ended up getting served by someone else halfway through our meal. I mean I'm glad though because our other server was so nice and so patient and we tried to get all our orders in at the same time so we didn't have to keep ordering and keep their kitchen open longer than should be since they were closing soon. Anyways I ordered a bunch of stuff the enoki bacon was super delicious, I liked the salmon don that was pretty good too. And at the end I got a maccha waffle omg very delicious dessert the food here is made very well. Near the end of my dinner I heard the waiter tell another table that they only had one chef cooking everything and I understand that but I don't know why they didn't tell our table that as well. But anyways 3 stars for my dining experience here, the service was ok food was delicious and waiting time was not wonderful. Hopefully next time I eat here service should be better and hopefully they don't have just one chef working",

We got there right after the lunch rush so had to wait about 10 mins to be seated so understandable. We ordered lunch combo instead and no regrets. Most are under $10 and we'll worth it and delicious. We tried the Salmon Miso, Sashimi,  Terriyaki Chicken & Chicken Katsuya Combo which also includes rice, Miso soup, salad and mixed tempura. Portions are good and they hit the spot. We finished off with some Strawberry sorbet and the must try Tofu Mouse. Total for party of 6 is under $80 which is well worth it.  We'll definitely come back to try the dinner menu next time.",

    "text": "OK, this review is overdue since I have been there 3 times. After my wonderful Raku experience I decided Kyara needs its proper shout out! We decided to go back tonight just to refresh my memory of why we loved it so much. I know some Yelpers disagree with the 5 star review compared to Raku, I disagree. Kyara deserves it for a great amount of reasons. Some are the same reasons of why I love Raku and some are different.  For one service is great! Those guys are outrageously polite and friendly! Got to love them! They are the kind of guys ( and I say guys because I have only seen Men waiters, sort of a Smith And Wolensky deal) that you actually would like to hang out with! My 6 year old daughter was with us and they were patient and super personable with her!  On to the food. When I first ate at Kyara I don't remember ever having the fill in sheet to order. I might be wrong.  In any event, they have one. You can fill it out and hand it in. I personally usually like to ask questions before doing so. This time I didn't, due to the fact that we were feeling adventurous and the fact that every meal we had there has been really good. That might of been a mistake this time. There were two dishes that we were not too particularly keen to. One of these dishes was the Niku Jaga, we had no idea how it was going to taste but, the English of this dish was a beef and potato type of stew, I think. Well it's extremely sweet! Seriously a soupy, potato, carrot and meat dish, so so so strangely sweet!! OK, so our fault. My husband asked the waiter because he actually thought they mistaken sugar for salt. No, they did not. It's supposed to be sweet. So this is where asking questions comes in handy instead of just filling in a form. Second dish Udon, I guess my fault as well. I decided I am very picky when it comes to soup and fish.  Our favorites are the Butabara (pork belly) so delicious, and the grilled whole squid, it is absolutely perfect!  I also particularly loved the Koro steak. All very  tasty! The chicken wing and the chicken thigh skewers were so flavorful!   The tomato caprese in a mozzarella sauce was also very memorable and a very unexpected dish that we all enjoyed. If you like potatoes get the garlic potato, my daughter really liked this one. It was nicely cooked and crispy yet soft in the inside and had a very nice garlic seasoning.   We tried a new beer, the Orion. If you like beer try this one. It is light and refreshing and not super filling. Make sure to ask for the small cold sake cups that are chilled, I think it makes it extra special.  The atmosphere is nice, it's open late, service is above average, it's reasonably priced and they have great tasting food.",

Favorite dishes: the mixed skewers, tempura cheese, and their sushi rolls. Kyara is not a sushi place per se, but their rolls are fat and innovative. The prices are great--my yuzu cocktails were under $6 each, and I think two of us were out for $100 and we ate and drank a lot. I will never go to Las Vegas and skip this place.",

We also had the Shrimp Butter Rice and an In-house specialty, Kyara Wings. Service was surprisingly fast as we had everything within 15 minutes of placing our orders.  I had never had Ika Maru, or fully cooked squid before, so maybe it was my fault because I didn't really enjoy it. There wasn't much of a flavour to it. The texture was interesting, like a thicker gummy worm. I might have to try it again sometime, but it's definitely something for those more experienced with Japanese cuisine.   The Shrimp Butter Rice and Kyara wings were amazing. The rice was so beautifully butter and flavorful, it was well complimented by the shrimp. The kyara wings seemed to have a teriyaki base, but was delectably spicy and sweet.  I can't praise the sashimi enough. Firstly the presentation, on a beautiful bowl of ice with a lemon wedge and wasabi. The taste was sublime. I've always heard of the buttery flavour and texture of raw salmon, but most places I had eaten raw salmon at did not provide that experience. This did. This salmon sashimi had a melt-in-your-mouth flavour, it was just delicious. If I had known it would be that good I would have ordered more of it.   The menu itself offers plenty of options, so for regular foodies and patrons there is definite repeat value.",

We were going to be sat at this small room in the back with about 4 tables or so.. but when its full of people there isn't much privacy to dine so we opted for the bar area which was pretty empty. The place also has private rooms... tables that is separated with walls.. looks quite interesting.. would be good for a private party or a bunch of close friends to dine with. The waiter we got was attentive and friendly as well as the others that delivered the food. The atmosphere at the bar was chill.. We even ordered drinks that was on special or happy hour. The beer cocktail I got was rather on the sweet side so wasn't too enthusiastic about it.  So lets talk about the food we ordered.. the best dishes we got were the salmon carpaccio and the yellowtail jalapeno!! yum!! So pretty and tastes amazing! We also ordered the ika geso kushi age, salmon rice ball, ika butter, hanetsuki gyoza, grilled shishamo, a bunch of different skewers variety and a sushi roll.. but don't exactly remember the name. Most are all very tasty!  Overall I liked this place and will be sure to come back again to dine in.",

If I was basing off service, I would give it a 3 stars, but since I really enjoy their food, I bumped it up to 4.   You really can't go wrong with any of tapas. I was here with a friend during my last visit and I felt like we basically ordered half the menu. One of my favorite item is the egg custard with seafood so of course I ordered that. I like that dish so much I ordered two, one for me and one for my friend because I didn't want to share. Tell me why 30 min after ordering the server came up to me and told me they only had ONE egg custard left... in the entire restaurant. And tell me why not long after the server told me that that the table next to us got their order of the egg custard. How can you run out? I don't get it. I told the server I'll still take the ONE egg custard and I guess I'll be nice and share with my friend. It seriously took 1.5 hr for my egg custard to come out. Maybe they were milking the cows and waiting for the chicken to lay the eggs so they can make my favorite dish? Idk. I mean don't get me wrong, the servers were nice but they are slooooow.

Lunch is not so busy, but for dinner.. expect to wait between 30 minutes to an hour long !  walking in... you see that there is a place to wait to get seated.. right away you get the Japanese vibe also walking in.. there is a bar you can choose to sit at or you can choose to sit a table.. music is playing.. current top 40s... EDM.. and sometimes japanese music..   waitors are friendly but its noticeable that they are trying to work as fast as they can to tend others therefore.. they might come off a little impatient.. so a little tip if its your first time..   FOOD is amazing.. ive tried pretty much everything on their dinner menu and nothing disappoints..   REMEMBER.. lunch menu is different from their menu.. so plan accordingly.. they do offer some good bento boxes for lunch that i enjoyed..  great for having drinks as well !! their sake was tasty.. and cant go wrong with japanese beer eating japanese food.. it just works !  they also got a big seating area for big parties.. not sure the body count but im guessing around 15 people can fit comfortably in there.. and its away from the smaller tables.. which was convenient..   plenty of parking around the building so that's not a problem..   enjoy!",

I've also tried the spicy salmon Bento box as well and it's a bit spicier than the salmon but it's still delicious.   The ambience is casual. I love how it has a nice Asian feel to the restaurant. The service has always been great since I've been coming here.   I've come here for dinner a couple of times and the service was great as well. The prices were more expensive around dinner time, but the food is still really good.",

The teppayaki was good but a little expensive compared to other places in town. The spicy tuna was horrible and I understand why it's on their happy hour menu. The one thing I was pleased with was their price of beer, but it is Vegas!   The environment is small and uncomfortable we were seating in this smaller half booth half table that seats 4 duos but it was very claustrophobic and loud because of our drunken neighbors which had clearly been over served..",

Came in on a Wednesday night and it wasn't too busy. Probably about an hour before close. We were greeted by the waitstaff and seated promptly in what gives you the feel of a private room.  The overall feel of the place is stereo typical of many of the Japanese new restaurants here in Vegas. A lot of polished wood furniture, floors, walls. Dark colors everywhere and a real low-key vibe.  First thing you notice on the menu is that it's 50% sushi and the rest grill items. Not too many choices for the vegetarians out there.  We started off with the main beef entree. Some kind of sirloin. They don't give you an option as far as temperature wise. Came out a medium well. I gave this a 4/5.  Tried the albacore carpaccio. Very tasty. Comes with a jalapeno on each. The sauce given is pretty amazing as well.  Tried a couple of pieces of sushi, the macro being one of them. Fresh and tasty. On par with most of the other places including the all you can eat.  This place seems to be known for its grill items. The yakitori style. Prices are decent. Portions are kind of tiny. That was my only gripe. Everything else was pretty decent. Service was good.",

It wasnt weird tasting at all, just kinda plain. I've heard if you cook low and slow that it turns into the best pot roast you've ever had. This was sliced thin and grilled and accompanied by a sesame oil dipping sauce. Pork cheek: very similar to pork belly, super tasty! Chicken wing: crispy outer skin, great with sweet sauce Bacon wrapped enoki: bacon makes everything delicious Shishito peppers: very mild heat and great flavor Tuna collar: slight fish taste (not in a bad way) grilled perfectly Sizzling beef with bean sprouts: I wish the beef was a little more rare but flavors were spot on Kurobuta sausage: salty, snappy skin that bursts with juices when you bite into it. Careful! Paired with onions and mustard  We could've probably stuffed one more dish in our stomachs but we didn't want to hurt ourselves lol we'll just have to come back for more.",

How are you making food for people that doesn't even have a table before the people that is already sitting down and waiting for their food. No common sense, bad communication and management. The manager came and apologize and gave us a $5.00 discount. I don't want nor need the $5.00 discount. I just want to be able to enjoy a nice meal which we never got from this place. Never again will we go back or recommend this place. If you want to eat here you'll be waiting a while for your food and I'm not talking about 10 or 20 mins. It'll be more like 40mins to an hour for your first dish. After reading some of the reviews other people also have similar issue with the wait time. The chefs here are so unorganized maybe they should go and get a proper training so they'll stop making food for people that doesn't have a table and really pay attention to the people that is already sitting down and waiting for their food.",

Try their tatsuta age -- crispy deep-fried marinated chicken morsels of the gods.  Speaking of their sashimi, Kyara is owned by the same Japanese national who owns the sushi centric restaurant Naked Fish. They both get much of their fish flown in daily from Japan.   Always polite, freindly service and they are open late. Try to sit at the counter.",

So instead, I decided to try Udon.  Their menu was one of the lamest I've seen without any descriptions of the items, only titles.  As I've never tried Udon, I am not sure if this is the norm or just their brand but the broth was boring and bland (tasteless) and the noodles tasted like noodles that had been cooked far too long.  It was served with no meat which was disheartening.  The only way I was able to stomach it was by doctoring it up with too much soy sauce and white pepper.    The service was good; my only complaint is that my server spoke limited English which made communicating with her a bit awkward.  However, it did add to the authenticity of the restaurant hehe I'd rather that than a server who's first language is NOT Japanese lol but say... Spanish (which seems to be happening more frequently)  Despite not enjoying the food I ordered, I may visit one more time as the food brought to the ladies seated next to me looked very delicious.",

    "text": "Had this placed bookmarked for months & my experience today w/ my bf was a complete disaster. First, when we walked in, it took awhile for anyone to acknowledge us because there was no hostess at the wait area. Finally, when a server did, she said that it'll be a a few minutes. We basically stood up the whole time since the small couch was occupied by 2 people and there was no way we can squeeze in.  12-15 minutes later, we were finally able to sit down. Walking in the dining area, i noticed there was plenty of seats at the bar area and she didnt bother offering that to us.   We went there around noon-ish for the lunch special. I ordered the Salmon Miso combo and my bf ordered the Spicy Salmon bowl combo. When they brought out the entrees, they forgot to bring out my Salmon Miso entree and the waitress stated \"it will be ready in a few minutes.\" First of all, why would you bring food when one of them is not ready??...6 minutes goes by until i can finally catch someone's attention (only 2 waitresses working there at the time). My bf had to start eating his food without me. When i asked her, \"where's my salmon?\" She said, \"oh, i'll get it right now\"...So basically, my salmon was ready & she totally forgot about it.  When we saw my bf's Spicy Salmon bowl combo, we were totally shocked at what it looked like. We thought they made a mistake. It looked like grounded up bright orange paste (i thought it was pureed smelt egg for a second). The bowl was 90% rice, 10% fish. My bf stated \"it's more mild than spicy and all i can taste is rice). My salmon miso was good, miso soup was ok and veggie tempura was typical. The waitress assured us the food was the spicy salmon.  The 2 waitresses that interchangeably served us never once checked on us. I have to keep flagging them down to even get their attention. We were both still starving after our meals. It looked plenty but it wasnt satisfying. For the price, I was happier and fuller with a bento box at Sumo sushi. I asked for a check and waited about 8 minutes. Finally, i had to flag the OTHER waitress down to bring me my check. When i gave her my credit card, she stated \"oh, our POS service is down. We have to make a carbon copy of your card.\" Really??? That was just the icing on the cake.   She noticed my bf and I did not look happy. She asked us if our food was ok. I was happy with my Salmon Miso but told her about my bf's Spicy Salmon bowl. My bf told her he was expecting it to actually look like a fish, kind of like the same form as my Salmon Miso. The waitress then stated \"Oh, the other waitress FORGOT to tell you it was RAW\". They didnt bother stating it was raw on the menu, yet alone explained it to us!!! My bf expressed his unhappiness with his food and all she can say was \"I'm sorry\".  The waitress, (one of their names was Yumi) didnt bother giving us a discount, yet alone comp my bf's entree. What kind of place does not state or even write that a particular entree is raw??? Some people do not like raw fish. I told my bf, \"maybe the food will be better for dinner\", but he was so turned off that he stated, \"I dont ever want to come back here.\" Service makes a huge difference as well! I had such high hopes due to the glowing yelp reviews!!!",

    "text": "Solid izakaya.  Good food, reasonable prices, with just the right amount of  culinary weirdness to remind you this is Vegas.  As a fellow yeep stated, \"Kyara is either he poor man's Raku or the rich man's Ichiza\"  So True.  Dishes do not deliver the authenticity or finesse of Raku but nor do the prices.  A good thing for the izakaya noob.  For starters, top props to the spicy tuna dip served with rice crackers.  Clean tuna flavor without the cloying mayo.  Great textural contrast when eaten on the rice crackers.  Other sashimi dishes are less successful, swimming in sauces that quickly \"cooks\" the fish (ceviche) and overpowers the subtle fish flavors.    Deep fried items deliver great flavor but do not order too many at once.  Maybe it was busy on my visits but the oil is not hot enough, so the food gets soggy fast.  Items with cheese; yes cheese, take on a very greasy, cloying mouth feel.  Not good eats. Stick to simple items.  The squid tentacles are absolutely delicious.  Ranging from tender to tough with a salty finish.  The gobo chips simple and earthy.  Finally, skewered and grilled items are all very good and averaging $2 a skewer, dirt cheap.  Chicken and pork options moist, veg barely cooked exuding freshness, both with a delicious hibachi char.  Great tasting marinades and sauces that give them all a flavor punch deserving of any beer.  The enoki clusters wrapped in bacon is a must try.   Special note:  Yamaimo is offered in many preparations on the menu.  If you have never tried it before, it is very challenging texturally.  Slimy and starchy.  You either like it or you don't.  Just sayin.  Friendly and efficient service.  Very reasonable prices.",

    "text": "Unfortunately, I have to give it a 2 star based on tonight's experience.  When we arrived at the restaurant at around 5:45 pm, the first thing the hostess asked was if we have any reservation without greeting us. When we said no she looked a little frustrated. She went inside and came back asking if we can finish before 7:50 pm.  We immediately agreed as we understand the table must be reserved for 8 pm. However she then added, \"if you don't finish by 7:50, we gonna Kick You Out.\"  At that moment I actually wanted just to walk away, but still stayed since everyone is here and we already said OK. The food was great as usual, and I also found some improvements on the menu; however the hostess in the beginning made the overall experience a little weird. It's difficult to find excuses for that kind of language used by restaurant employees to their customers.",

    "text": "Depending on your perspective, Kyara is either the poor man's Raku or the rich man's Ichiza when it comes to Japanese izakayas in Las Vegas.    With Raku, there are potential issues with time constraints and difficulty in making reservations on short notice along with the hefty bill whereas with Ichiza, it is always crowded/noisy and service can be shoddy along with variations in quality across the spectrum of items offered.  The dining experience here is laid back and refined, prices are reasonable (and even a steal if you come during happy hour), and the food is consistently delicious and served with impeccable timing.    Having recently gone with 3 friends visiting from out of town, we were able to explore a wide spectrum of the menu, and I was very impressed with the range of offerings as well as the consistency in flavors.   Some notable highlights include the following:  Yuzu chili salmon salad- fresh thin slices of salmon sashimi drizzled in a yuzu vinaigrette, the slightest dollop of japanese mayo and ring of jalapeno served alongside a well-dressed bed of arugula, a nice combo of punchy bold flavors that do not overpower the palate.    Ika Geso Age (Deep fried squid tentacles)-  flash fried tender morsels dredged with the slightest bit of batter served immediately out of the deep fryer; add a fresh squeeze of lemon, and you may not ever crave (Italian)calamari ever again.  Chicken Karaage (japanese fried chicken)-  an izakaya staple, the most common slip-up is that the chicken is overcooked or under-seasoned, but both pitfalls were avoided so I was unduly impressed  Seafood chawanmushi-  velvety egg custard intertwined with fresh scallops and shrimp, you will want to get your own cup to savor every bite all to yourself without sharing.  Motsu Ni (pork intestine stew)-  the wild card order that was offal-ly good.  Unctuous simmered broth with tender strands of intestine, nice cubes of yam cake, a wonderful warm soup for a cold day.  Yamaimo Teppan (mountain yam on hot plate)-  a sure crowd pleaser both in terms of presentation and taste;  a thin bed of grated mountain yam served on a hotplate covered with bonito shavings and seaweed, it's fun to see the bonito curling in the heat as though the dish were alive, and one is also given a long spoon to scrape the yam off from the hot plate.  The best way I can describe the beautiful synergy of textures is akin to biting into an omelette, grilled cheese sandwich and mashed potatoes all at the same time...culinary magic.  Other notables include the seared mackerel, grilled squid, and chicken garlic ponzu, and other yelpers have complimented their dessert selection as well.  Perhaps the only criticism may be that some dishes were a bit on the saltier side, but I think this may be intentional since much like the salty American bar staples of hot wings and nachos, these Japanese pub offerings are all meant to be enjoyed with ice cold beer, sake, or even single malt Japanese whiskey alongside the company of good friends.",

Can't beat it...and to answer your question, it BLOWS away that other place on Spring Mountain (the one that sounds like \"cheese\" LOL).  I won't go over ALL the dishes I ordered, but EVERYTHING I ordered was great...including some \"close your eyes\" yummy!  The Aburi Shime Saba was a good dish to start...imagine sushi grade mackerel cut sashimi style with a yummy ponzu sauce.  Lots of fish for the money too!   The Pork Kimchee was amazing!  The best I've had....great portion size too, but the taste was even better!  Mouth watering thinking about the spices...and yes, it was actually slightly spicy!  One of my favs of the night!  Pic :  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kyara-japanese-tapas-las-vegas-2?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#HCycIWoNWwx2a0PP9WkdOg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/kyar...</a>  The Onigiri (rice ball) was a great touch!  My little guy murdered the entire thing!  It is a very large rice ball, filled with cooked salmon, and wrapped with nori/seaweed!  He absolutely loved it...great for kids and only $2??  I tried a bunch of different skewers/kushi.  The really good ones were the Gyutan/tongue (great portion!) the Tsukune (ground chicken and pork) which reminded me of a gyro/kabob, and the Butabara/pork belly which was a good mix of meat/fat ratio!  The Gyutan :  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kyara-japanese-tapas-las-vegas-2?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#ktT-nhgnGpOt1rz7fiBK0A\">yelp.com/biz_photos/kyar...</a>  Tsukune :  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kyara-japanese-tapas-las-vegas-2?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#eFaxr0vwP6CLxgLPiBsDiw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/kyar...</a>  All of these I recommend with the shio/sauce, as the sauce was great tasting and worth dipping it all up off the plate!  To finish, we ordered the Green Tea waffles!    <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kyara-japanese-tapas-las-vegas-2?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#YgjwJkdGXzXjhiJ0voRwYg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/kyar...</a>  They were packed with tea flavor, surprising actually.  The honey and butter get poured over the top, and make a very good dessert!  I like it better than the honey toast!  Service was decent, food comes out slow at first, but then fast once you start getting your dishes.  I had to ask for refills, but the staff was friendly and the food more than makes up for it!  Give it a go!",

    "text": "I'll start with what I DIDN'T like here.  It's short so bear with me.  I much prefer the more communal setting you get at Ichiza or Shuseki, than here where it feels more like a restaurant than a bar.  Maybe a bit darker, have row seats instead of chairs?  I don't know, it's a small complaint because with that, I think you would get the complete experience.  Anyway, on to what is great.  First, the service is awesome.  Our main guy was super nice, and the couple other that brought the food or cleaned up were also very pleasant.  I suppose you could find a fault in getting first-class service at an izakaya, if you are wanting to truly experience that bar atmosphere.  I will choose not to.  The place is new restaurant-clean, which, again, could detract from the bar experience.  I don't mind it at all.  And then the food.  First of all, they have hands-down the best grilled whole squid I have ever had.  Tender and moist and cooked to perfection.  We also ordered:  * Yuzu Chili Salmon salad - light and slightly spicy, yum * Several skewers - pork cheeks was to die for * Ikamaru - the whole squid I was talking about * Yaki Onigiri chazuke - great presentation, great taste * Teppan Ramen - sort of wet chow mein using ramen noodles.  This was awesome. * Shrimp takoyaki - perfectly fried, could have used a bit more flavor * Fried oysters - perfectly fried, fresh oysters, but the crust overpowered the oysters a bit.  You have got to try the Teppan Ramen, which is on the Specials menu.  All-in-all, this was the best food I've had at an izakaya anywhere.  I will have to come here for happy hour sometime, they have some killer sake deals for late night!  Once again, Vegas proves they can out-do L.A. when it comes to non-sushi Japanese!  Table-for-1 Factor:  Hmm... if any izakaya can cater to a single, this might be it.  But then, it is an izakaya...",

Kyara's food is consistently bland (other than the pork belly), the sushi rolls are very small, and you don't leave thinking, \"wow, that was great.\"  If I had to pick a Japanese Tapas restaurant, I would go for Izakaya Go.  The overall quality and taste of the dishes are levels (two stars in my opinion) better than Kyara.  If I wanted sushi, I would go to Yonaka Modern Japanese or Yama Sushi if I wanted AYCE.  If I wanted Japanese Fusion, I would go to Japaneiro (which is where I would probably go if I had to choose from one of all the above).",

The miso soup was perfect, as was the white rice, and green salad. Yes, all of that came in the lunch special! The value is amazing. I docked one star because the service was a little bit slow.

Yasai haru maki (vegetable spring roll) - DO drench this with the lemon and eat it while it's hot. The temperature and the acid from the lemon makes it go so well!  Cheese tempura - Uhm...no. Bad mistake. I don't like cheese and I don't know why I ate this. If you like cheese that's partially melted and deep fried, go for it!  Chicken gizzard skewer  - chewy and yummy!  Chicken wing skewer - ok this one was done pretty awkward. It's not one of the chicken wing you'd get from a bar. It's the WHOLE wing it self poked with two skewers!  Bacon wrapped asparagus - YUM! Just too bad it came with 4 pieces. Needs more bacon!  They have a special menu that's priced $4-$6.

I go to Kyara since it's very close from my house, but I'd prefer somewhere else for Japanese Tapas (it's just too far to drive to China town sometimes). Customer service is okay, I don't think it's spectacular. A great place for small tapas and sake, but I feel much comfortable and happy at Ichiza or naked fish.",

My favorite part about this place is that the food is very fresh, and you can try a variety of things at an affordable price. Favorites: Ika Butter (squid in a butter/soy sauce..Delish!), Ika Maru (squid perfectly grilled whole), salmon belly (ultra fresh and yummy fatty) but pricey at $14 for small portion, rainbow roll, Poke seaweed salad (super fresh and tasty...great starter), wagyu nigiri (BOMB! I should have got more!). The Gobo chips were interesting (sweet crispy vegetable root starter), and the Mochi ice cream was a great way to end. Kobe beef tataki was good but wouldn't get it again. Butabara (pork belly skewer) was average at best. Would definitely come here again and try other things.",

Definitely over-ordered based on our initial excitement over the menu choices and prices but no big deal. Stand outs included the best chawamushi in LV, yuzu chili salmon and grilled squid. The only thing we weren't into was the ika no shiokara (fermented squid guts). I never liked that dish but even my Japanese wife who normally likes it thought it was too creamy and a bit off.   Aside from that, the whole dining experience was great. The staff was super friendly, very helpful and accommodating. Just what you'd expect from a high end izakaya!",

We sat at the bar, where we could see a clean and active kitchen, and a nice view of the small establishment.  While waiting for Debbie I ordered \"iced green tea\" and ended up with a can of  green tea over ice - fine, but probably not worth $2.50.  The rest of the experience was well worth the cost, which was very fair for what we ate!  We started off by ordering homemade tofu, which I was hopeful for after reading David S.'s review, but they were out.  We got the rice crackers with kabocha dip.  It was sweet and velvety.  Debbie sensed a vanilla flavor, and it was topped with chopped peanuts.  Next, the agedashi nasu (eggplant) topped with shishito pepper.  I loved the broth, and the eggplant was only lightly fried.  The broth was so flavorful!  Then, the magical yuzu chili salmon.  Delicious!  Debbie N. loves salmon so I made sure she got more, and I ate more of the greens in the yuzu dressing.  Delightful!  Then my pick, the seared mackerel with ginger, daikon and ponzu.  It had a grill/smoky flavor but yet the perfect cross between firm and delicate texture that I love about mackerel.  This was a winner and the portion was very generous.  The man next to us was the Kaeru Kid, a west-coast travel writer who had been all over the world.  He let us sample his tofu steak with bean sprout dish, and it was hearty!!!  Debbie N. said I must try the kaisen chawanmushi since I never had it.  It was so delicious!  It had a sort of egg-drop flavor to me, but the texture was unique and it was so full of seafood - bay scallops, shrimp, kamaboko fish cake, oyster or mussel, calamari...wow!  We decided to get one more dish.  Our waitress had sang the praises of the beef tongue stew and said it was on special tonight, so we opted for it...only to find out it was sold out too!!!  Two strikeouts for us.  We decided to get the soft shell crab appetizer and it came with ponzu.  We missed Teri C. here by 4 hours apparently, and Debbie mentioned how the restaurant must pay attention to reviews and make changes (like adding a sauce to the crab as Teri C. suggested).  Two of the chefs behind the counter recognized Debbie and greeted her personally.    I like the atmosphere, the prices are very reasonable, and there are a lot of unique options to try.  We didn't try any skewers this trip, so I need to return for some of those.  We leisurely dined and relaxed for two hours, and our waitress brought me water when my can of tea ran out.  Good service, lots of yelling irrashaimase and gozaimas as people are in and out, and the food speaks for itself!",

I'm actually just partial to any place that serves Japanese tapas but it's not about that... 4 stars because I'm not completely in love with everything that I order and that it's really dark so I can't see what I'm eating half the time.  Gobo chips: I think this is deep-fried burdock root seasoned with salt and pepper. This was my first time trying something like this so 5/5 because I liked it instantly. Simple and I really like the texture of it.  Yuzu chili salmon salad: So delicious! I get this every single time I order. In love with the sauce and the freshness of the salmon and salad together. 5/5  Enoki bacon: Bacon-wrapped anything is just a good idea in my book. This even more so because I love enoki mushrooms. 5/5  Mini udon: Not very special or unique. Tasted like most regular udon soup bases but still yummy. The only thing that really stood out and made it a little better were the noodles. They were smaller than regular udon noodles but not too thin and still firm. 4/5  Green tea waffles: Don't really remember what it tasted like but I do remember being really satisfied. 4/5  Garlic potatoes: Not that special either but I think because of them being bite-sized, seasoned, and deep-fried it makes it addicting. 3/5  Eggplant: I loved this! Good sauce and very yummy. Just very oily and was a tiny bit harder to eat because you scrape it off the skin. 4.5/5  Salmon onigiri: plain and kind of blah. 1.5/5  Overall, I love it here.",

Their menus had a lot of photos in them. Our table, when sat, was full of menus--they handed us 3 different menus to order from (see pics - pretty funny!) Sushi menu from Naked Fish, $2.80 & $3.80 izakaya menu, sakes and alcohol, a full regular food menu...I couldn't keep track of all of them!   The menus included a potato salad (Japanese potato salad is really good, and theirs was made with bleu cheese. I didn't order it, but my antennae are raised for the next time.) Karage, katsu, spring rolls, butter squid etc. typical iza food all found here.   It was dimly-lit, and while hard to see, I liked the feeling/look. They had individual shoji-screened rooms for intimate dinners in the other room, but we ate in the tiny main area of the restaurant. We ordered from every menu except the alcohol one:  -Baby ika (squid) with garlic and asparagus *on special* - SO DELICIOUS. I didn't want the little bowl to end. -Koro Koro steak. I don't eat beef but I made my friend eat it (I paid, so I got to call the shots haha!) He didn't have any feedback on it. I ate the bean sprouts underneath the steak. Really salty sauce; don't think I would order a chicken version of one if they offered it. -Agedashi tofu. One of my most favorite things to eat. I am keeping my tofu intake low these days, but it was both beautiful and delicious. Silken tofu with a soft-fried exterior, swimming in a soy broth...a staple for me. -Kyara popper. True story. When I asked the waiter what he liked that I should order, he recommended this: a crabmeat filled jalapeno. While spicy and good, I would not have ordered something like this here. This is the kind of fusion I can live without lol  -Kawa. Skewers of chicken skin! Aaah, it was like eating in Japan again! Fatty, fatty goodness. I was sad that I gobbled two, and considered ordering another one. -Sasami. Chicken tender skewer. This took the longest to prepare and I was surprised how big each skewer was. It was like they twisted an entire breast onto them!  -My buddy ordered a roll, but I can't remember what he ordered. I think he liked it? -Dessert (thanks, Yelp check-in!) was vanilla ice cream with a green tea sauce drizzled on it. I tried it and it was a nice way to close the meal.   My entire bill was $46. For two people. Ridic. Give these guys your business; you won't be disappointed!",

    "text": "I just had dinner at Kayara and upon arriving home felt so compelled to writes review after my amazing dinner EXPERIENCE. I emphasize the experience part of it.  I love Ichiza. It's SO hard to get a table! And the wait? Forget it.   We were seated right away and the greeting when you come in is cute.  We received a large table which is awesome to not cram all of our food on a tiny table.  The restaurant is fairly new and well kept. Very clean and very modern. The stone chopstick holders are a nice touch. More refined than Ichiza. They have seats that are NOT the booth part which are small and kind of award. I'm short so no biggie, but the tall folk should sit on the booth part.   They give you a few menus including: a beverage menu, a sushi menu, a $2.80-3.80 menu, and their normal menu. The normal menu also includes a seasonal menu that changes each month which is on an insert of the menu on the first page. There is a big selection on their 2.80-3.80 menu just FYI.  Biggest love hate at Ichiza is? The items on paper covering the walls! Ordering is difficult!  WELL! HERE! They give you a pencil and paper to write which items you want that correlate with the menu. They're organized similarly so it's fairly easy to do. ALSO! Write any of the specials on the back of the paper!  Maybe it was slow, but our server, Mimi, was awesome. Not overly nice just so helpful. She actually filled out the order sheet for us, went through the pages of the menus one by one with us, and explained each dish we had questions about while giving us suggestions.   She even told us to check in on FB or Yelp so we each got a free dessert. And she asked for our names a the beginning of the meal and addressed us by them when we left.  When she brought our dishes to us she explained them to us, why certain garnishes came with them, explained how to eat the dishes with certain sauces, and always told us to enjoy.  Everything came out in a timely manner. Everything came out hot if it was meant to and cold if it was meant to.  Pet peeve alert: Usually at a restaurant you have a server and then some people help drop food off, but the people just drop stuff off and that's it. The staff here all checked on us, always smiled, brought us fresh hot tea and water many times. There was even a guy standing about 10 feet away in case we needed anything.  After getting our free dessert for checking in, paying, then leaving.. The host walks you out and holds the door while the staff yells something in Japanese I'm assuming means good night.  Overall it was just an awesome dining experience. The food was well priced, everything tasted good, everything was presented beautifully, the restaurant is beautiful, their staff is so nice. So in the end I definitely recommend Kayara. There were a lot of nice small touches that I just loved.   I'll just list some of the things we had with my favorites first.  FREE house tea. Hot, deep, delicious.   -Agedashi tofu and agedashi eggplant. Both are fried and served in a soy broth. I dream of this stuff! I first tried it at Ichiza and loved it. The version at Kayara is much better! There is a garnish of fresh ground ginger that really brightens the soy broth and it's also garnished with a fried shiseto pepper. (Two different dishes) I highly recommend these.  -Butter squid rings AND baby squid with asparagus. Soft squid rings sauteed in butter and seasoning. Addicting because the ikka was cooked perfectly. (Two different dishes)  -rice crackers with spicy tuna. Just a play on chips and dip. This was just average.  Soft shell crab appetizer. Tempura fried. This was perfectly cooked. Served with a lemon. Simple. Good.   Tuna Poke. This was good, but a bit salty. I enjoyed it, but not the best poke. I'd pass next time.   Skewers. We got eggplant, shiitake mushroom, and shiseto peppers. They are served with a sweet gingery sauce that was for the egg plant which came skinned.  Tomato caprese. This was a bed of thinly sliced avocado with sliced cherry tomatoes and chopped herb on top. A white cheese sauce was drizzled over. This was okay. All fresh ingredients, but one dimensional. My friend loved it though.  -pork belly on bean sprouts. I love pork belly. Any way! It was simple stir fried bean sprouts with three pieces of salted and peppered pork belly. Simple and yummy. Could have used some freshness, but pork belly is always good.  Shabu salad: this is grilled meat served on spinach. I LOVE SPINACH. Ichiza has a very good version, but I appreciate the use of spinach and the large portion of meat. The flavors were awesome. One of my favorites. Warning: some of the meat has a lot of fat, but that's a pro for me.   For dessert we got vanilla ice cream with a green tea reduction. It was nothing fancy, but it was delicious. Complete with cute wooden spoon.  We will def be back to try the famous green tea waffle and also the chocolate dessert.   I just spent an your writing this review. Go try the place!",

One of the few places where I grub on some Uni (trust me, it's fantastic here) and one of the few places I would smash all the veggie skewers in one sitting.  Gobo chips and the maguro zuke don bowl are top picks for me at Kyara but make sure to grub on the buttered tako and, if you're feisty, some of the japanese whiskey proves to go down nicely with the meal.  Great food, good service, but so FAR away from me.. ugh.. oh well, still awesome!!",

I had several different skewers, Yaki Onigiri, a Salmon Sashimi Bowl, and washed it down with peach sake. I even tried a bunch of other stuff the my friends had, and I would recommend all of it. Since it's tapas style, the price can add up, so be aware of how much you ordered. I have no problem recommending this restaurant to anyone. There is so much on the menu that I haven't tried, so I'm sure I'll be back.",

I assume this place is a lot busier during their happy hour, which would make coming here very worth while. Their food is pretty good. I ordered a few skewers, chicken gizzard my favorite! But it needed a bit more seasoning (salt did the trick) and it was a bit cold when it got to the table, which was a downside. Also order the beef intestine (sweeter seasoning and it was amazingly good) and yuzo chili salmon salad, pretty good. Decently priced, $9.50 might be a bit over the top for 5 slices of salmon though, but not by much. I wouldn't mind ordering it again. My friend order the salmon bowl which was a bigger bang for your buck. My grouped ordered takoyaki (6 pcs). I wanted to try their beef tongue, but I wasn't ready to splurge $8 on s skewer, but then we saw this beef tongue dish that was around the same price, but sadly forgot to order it and we were to full to get it when we realized. I found a new favorite drink from here called Peach calipico sour refreshing ($3.80) and bubbly. Their reggae punch is pretty good too. Refreshing, but no bubbles. It's been my second time here, I don't really remember the first time since I just ordered a cocktail. I'm glad I tried their food this time and every was friendly and service was good. Give them a try, you won't regret.",

It comes with shrimp and veggies tempura, miso soup, salad, rice, and the protein of your choice! The location is pretty easy to find but the restaurant is a little bit small.   But I have to warn you, the service is SUPER SLOW!! That's the one thing I don't like. I gave a 4 star for food but 3 star for service!  This place also have happy hour after 10pm so if you want $3 sake and some snacks to hang out, you can check out it at night as well...",

    "text": "Decided to hit up Kyara Japanese Tapas for lunch today, close to work and always good food. We were delighted to find they had reasonably priced lunch specials. I had only been here before for dinner.  My colleagues ordered the sushi and sashimi specials and I chose the Lisa Lisa roll and some salmon nigiri. If the Lisa Lisa sounds familiar to those of you who live in Las Vegas, it's because Kyara is a sister property of Naked Fish's on Durango.  The specials came out quickly which included a salad, soup, shrimp and veggie tempura and a bowl of rice. The nigiri variety and sashimi came out after a bit and my colleagues both said they would definitely come back again. The Lisa Lisa was good. Shrimp tempura with avocado and cream cheese topped with crunch and eel sauce. The salmon nigiri was fresh and tasted good with the hidden dab of wasabi under it.  To sum up, was a good meal had by all and we will be back. Arigatogozaimashita, Totemo",

I come maybe 3 times a month for lunch since it's 5mns away from my office restaurant is located near Jones and 215W if you decide to come for lunch make sure you come before noon or after 1pm, the place is always packed. Many Japanese native are having lunch or dinner meaning it's Yummy Yummy! they raised their lunch menu but it's still worth it! their lunch special always come with shrimp and veggie tempura, salad, rice, miso soup. I highly recommend the sushi lunch menu. Fish is always fresh.  the salmon or tuna Poke are amazing as well. philadelphia roll is one of my favorite same menu at dinner time will be more pricy  the restaurant is very cosy. Try it you won't regret it",

    "text": "This is probably one of the worst reviews Ive done.  I probably wont come back again.    Let me start with the food.  The food is okay, personally the kimchi was probably my favorite.  We got the Mini Stamina Don (Pork Belly with garlic on rice), Yellowtail Jalapeno, Kimchi, Chutoro Sashimi, Salmon Belly Sashimi, Ika Gueso, Beef Tongue, and Miso Soup.  I had the don, beef tongue, and kimchi.  The beef tongue was good but the pork belly was alright.    Now for service, it was terrible.  There wasnt much people even here and everything took forever.  We got the Miso soup last because our server forgot about it.  We waited literally an hour for it and for the rest probably 45 minutes. The table next to us ordered as we were waiting but got their food right away which I dont understand how and why. Probably because one of the girls was a coworker.  They got great service and our server was attentive to them.  I also didnt know that employees could drink alcohol while working.  Maybe thats why we got lame service.  The table next to us was also very obnoxious.  They kept yelling for the server because they were so drunk.    I honestly wont be returning to this place because it just sucks.  I had high expectations and wanted to rate it high as possible but service is a big thing to me.  I used to be a server & I understand if it was busy but there was barely any tables.",

    "text": "With the sudden and sad departure of SHIN Yakitori House in the Spring Valley area, Kyara comes as a welcome addition in this neighborhood.  Call it a cross between Ichiza and Raku, this town has plenty of room for another izakaya type of establishment and many hungry customers waiting in the wings.  Kyara is located in an unassuming and relatively quiet area along Jones and Sunset next to a Tropical Smoothie Cafe.  The mood is set when you enter what feels like a upscale restaurant.  Chaos is not what this place is about.  There are plenty of counter seats where you can watch the kitchen in action, but with the Baby in tow, we sat at a table. The restaurant is set up in sections making private parties a great possibility.  Once we were seated, there was a slight lapse where we thought we had been forgotten. Instead, they were deep frying a fresh taste of their mountain potato to get your taste buds working.  The menu is easily broken up with their daily specials being the star. It's very much a revolving menu as items available two months ago aren't offered now.  Our dinner items:  * Deep fried Yamaimo - This mountain potato was lightly fried with a sprinkling of furikake.  The delicate flavor surprisingly impressed us and had us wanting more of this complimentary offering.  As someone asked, was it gooey...and not at all!  * Yuzu Chili Salmon Salad ($7.50) - Five slices of salmon along with greens makes this a tasty dish.  Assembled quite simply but satisfyingly.  * Albacore Jalapeno ($7.50) - Seven slices of albacore that had a sauce that we enjoyed.  * Spicy Tuna Dip ($5) - A generous ball of spicy tuna alongside crispy rice crackers.  We spread the tuna onto the cracker and enjoyed the crunch along with the spice.  * Agedashi Tofu ($4.30) - Good, but not quite my favorite although I still enjoyed it.  * Negi Ma ($1.90) - The chicken and green onion we chose to have sauce on it, our mistake.  Skip the sauce next time.  * Enoki Bacon ($2.30) - Anything wrapped in bacon tastes good!  * Kawa ($2.20) - Grilled chicken skin...a dash of salt and togorashi is all you need.  * Butabara ($2.20) The pork belly was a rather disappointing since it was dried out and not fatty enough for me.   * Daikon Salad ($4.20) - I'm not usually a fan of daikon salad but the simple additions to their version makes it a nice and subtle dish.  * Gyutan ($5.50) - The beef tongue was good, but not as tender as I would have hoped.  * Kaisen Chawanmushi ($5) - Their version of a steamed custard was the real winner of the night.  It was super super smooth and luxurious and probably among the best chawanmushis I have ever experienced.  It also came with a decent amount of seafood inside and the Husband and I were both thoroughly impressed.  Worth getting your own and not sharing.  * Koro Steak ($9.50) - We were told it was quite tender and that is the very truth.  We both loved the steak, but could have done without the beansprouts...something else would have been better.  * Soft Shell Crab Appetizer ($5.80) - My only real complaint was that it lacked something...a dipping sauce of maybe ponzu, tempura sauce, or Japanese mayo would have been nice.  But then again, maybe that's how I usually get it elsewhere and that's how I'm used to having it.  * Tofu Mousse ($4.80) \"Homemade Vanilla Tofu Mousse\" - We're all about homemade tofu and definitely wanted to try their sweet version.  It was accompanied by a raspberry(?) sorbet-like granita that could have been broken down a bit more.  It arrived in chunks that made it   difficult to get into with the wooden spoons provided.  Nonetheless, we still enjoyed this sweet ending to our dinner.    Overall, it was a lovely Mother's Day dinner.  Service was polite and what you would expect from a real Japanese restaurant.  We were impressed by the number of Japanese diners there along with the families as well.  It brings a different ambiance and we liked it.  There are a few things that are a bit more costly than what I'd expect, so be prepared.  We'll be going back again to see what other specials come up!  * * Update! We returned on 06.24.  Additional items we tried included:  * Beef Tataki ($9.50) -   * Homemade Tofu ($4.80) - We love the simplicity of homemade tofu.  Here it is accompanied with wasabi, bonito shavings, finely grated ginger, and scallions.  * Tofu Miso Kushi ($1.50) - Three pieces on a skewer, grilled with some miso sauce.  Simple and tasty.  * Wakasagi Age \"Deep Fried Surf Smelt\" ($4.50)   * Ayu Shio Yaki \"Grilled seasonal sweet fish from Japan\" ($9.50)   * Hirame Carpaccio \"Halibut - South Korea\" ($6.50)  * Gyu Shabu Salad \"Sliced Beef & Spinach\" ($6.50)  * Chocolate Fondant \"Homemade Chocolate Fondant with Vanilla Ice Cream\" ($6.50)  We were offered a different complimentary taster, but we craved the deep fried yamaimo.  They were nice enough to fry us up a batch!  Love it! Dessert was free because it was the Husband's birthday!   4.5 stars from 4 stars!",

    "text": "This is quite possibly my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas.  My man and I come here often for both lunch and dinner.  Our most recent meal was for Valentine's Day and we were greeted with complimentary champagne.  When we ordered a bottle of wine (Wolfgang Puck Chardonnay, excellent and only $30!) our server displayed it in the chiller with baby's breath and wrapped in red linen, so cute and festive!  The lunch combos are great and very good value, but the dinner is what keeps us coming back.  The plates are great for sharing and small enough that we can get lots of variety.  We usually get around 10 or so different items.  Having worked our way through almost everything on the menu by now, we still have not found a single dish here we didn't like.  Make sure you save room at the end for the green tea mochi ice cream.  The contrast between the cold smooth ice cream and the chewy gelatinous mochi is amazing and a light but satisfying end to the meal.  Sitting up at the bar gives a great view into the kitchen and the chef will often come by and talk to us about the dishes.  This is especially beneficial if you are an adventurous eater like I am (chef has teased us about being the only non-Asian people to order some of the more out there options).  The February specials include live scallops so fresh the chef said it was still wiggling when he sliced it.  Also try anything with Ika (raw squid).  The texture and flavor are fantastic.  This place really is authentic Japanese cuisine.  We will definitely be back again and again.",

    "text": "Without ever having been to Ichiza or Raku I can't say where Kyara fits in the hierarchy of Las Vegas izakayas. But, I can tell you that I'm a fan. Not only is the food delicious, but the layout of the restaurant is inviting yet intimate, with it's small, separate dining areas surrounding its open kitchen. The look of the place is that of a modern japanese motif without being heavyhanded and over-adorned with unnecessary flair.  But, what you really want to hear about is the food, right? Here are the hits and misses that we ordered:  HITS: + Maguro carpaccio ($7.50) - brilliant, brightly colored tuna, thinly sliced. Wonderful flavors. So good we had a second order. Loved the garlic chips atop each slice of fish. + Albacore with jalapeno ($7.50) - delicious, fresh. Another dish we had to order seconds of. + Veggie spring rolls ($2.50) - light, crispy, not the largest spring rolls, but delicious nontheless + Veggie tempura mix ($4.50) + Cheese tempura ($6.50) - three slices of fairly mild cheeses (mozzarella, havarti, brie) accompanied by a fig jam. I liked it but it's a difficult dish to share if you want to split each piece of cheese.  Misses:  - Spicy tuna dip with rice crackers ($5) - not my favorite. I wasn't a fan of the paste-like texture of the tuna and it had little heat to it. - Pork belly ($2.20) - 3 per skewer. They were ok, but after having the pork belly at Sushi House Goyemon a couple days earlier I was disappointed. The biggest turnoff was the tiny bits of cartilage in two of the pieces of pork.  I thought everything was reasonably priced. Expect to pay anywhere from $20-40 per person depending on how hungry you are. And, they have some good wines by the glass for around $5. That's tough to beat in this town. Good food + good prices = I'll be back often.",

    "text": "Just a little teaser for our first visit but enough to get us back to try more!  We went 10pm and I am trying to be good so wasn't looking to eat everything like I normally would :)  I had to try the Yuzu chili salmon salad as I saw so many great reviews on it so will definitely come back for that, so yummy!  However not a fan of the aji tataki, too fishy and too much ginger for me.  I wanted to try it since in the happy hour menu and thought it would me like a tuna tartar.  Had the shrimp tempura with spicy tuna and albacore on top which was good.  deja Vu will be our next try.  Hubby enjoyed the pork fried rice and butter corn.  It's a cute place and the wide menu variety is great so will be back to try more on a cheat day :)  The only thing that was a little off was the waiter didn't come to check on us, so had to flag him down to place another order, order dessert and then for the check so that could have been better, even just one time.  Everyone else came by a lot though to fill our water and take our finished plates.  Overall, good food, fun options and it's closeby, so I forsee us being back as regulars.",

Food was nothing special, the things I can remember having are the garlic potatoes, grilled squid, yuzu chili salmon, soft shell crab, enoki mushrooms w/ bacon, chicken skin, pork belly skewers, chicken skewers, some beef bowl, and some sashimi. The only things that stood out were the yuzu chili salmon and pork belly - everything else was pretty forgettable. Their lychee chu cocktail of lychee syrup, shochu and soda was really good and under $5. Perfect light summer cocktail.    Food came out at a really odd pace, skewers took 15-20 min even though kitchen seemed adequately staffed and the place wasn't full. Just an overall mediocre experience for $30/person. I may come back for lunch, but I'll stick to Raku for this type of food. Similar pricing but Raku does the same thing so much better.    I'd also recommend getting the skewers with salt, not sauce - get some on the side if anything so it's not drowned in teri sauce.",

Sometimes its the little things that matter and make your dining experience better.    No more waiting at the door.  It seems they now acknowledge everybody that walks through the door and will immediately seat you.  I've been a regular ever since. Great  lunch specials, and in my opinion best tempura in town.  Did i mention great lunch specials?  Very filing Soup, Salad, Rice, tempura and Sashimi. Perfect. Since i've become a regular, I love the fact that I walk in and they know exactly what I'm going to have. Friendly service, and quick check out process. I've only been here for lunch so I don't know what dinner is like but I'll try it when I work late one night.  Thank you for making my lunch experience so amazing.",

    "text": "So where do you do when Sierra Gold's kitchen is closed for no reason? Obviously Kyara cause Japanese tapas area perfect substitute... Ok yeah we went cause it was right next door and open at 12am.  Usually I am not a big fan of tapas restaurants... All to often 'tapas' turns out to be a restaurant's excuse to offer up small portions of food at full price, and while Kyara wasn't exactly an exception to this, it was definitely worth it.  Kyara is a pretty good alternative to the long wait times at Ichiza or if you can't get a table at Raku. The restaurant is kinda like a Japanese Firefly and so far without the Salmonella poisoning which is a definite plus! Some of the dishes worth checking out: are the mochi bacon skewers, cheesy tomato potato, and the pork skewers.  The food was great but a little over-priced. At about $4 per skewer and $8 for a larger dish you can easily drop $30 bucks here and still be able to eat more, but then again, I don't think you get these dishes anywhere else in town.  The service was kinda of slow but the servers were so polite it almost made up for it. Yes I am being generous with the 4 stars but they get props for offering a yelp check-in offer! Vanilla ice cream with green tea paste yummm.",

Usually I had to wait long time to get seated; however, we were seated right away this time.We ordered plum wine (choya), pork kimchi, ika butter, pork fried rice, and ramen. I have been there for more than 10 times, but the consistency of the food is absent most of the times. The noodles for the ramen tasted bad and kind of puffy. Some servers are friendly and attentive. Some need more training on customer service. I would rate Kyara better than Ichiza, but I still do think they have room for improvement in order to satisfy more customers.",

I normally dart to the booth if possible, but I was too slow, but I wasn't hurting like I normally would when sitting on a seat without back support.   Three of us came in at 11pm on a Friday and was surprised by how slow it was. By midnight, it was beginning to fill out. The service was speedy and friendly without being intrusive.   We had ordered the mini udon, the perfect single portion with a few slices of fish cakes and seaweed. The broth was light and refreshing. The garlic potatoes were thrown in a thin breading and came out crispy. We also got tofu and beef. The broth for the dish was sweet, the meat is similar to bulgogi, and the tofu picked up both flavors well. Make sure to check what the daily specials are because if they have the homemade tofu, it is a must. With the consistency and slight sweetness, it is reminiscent of a panacotta. It was creamy and rich without being over decadent. Paired with the scallions, grated ginger, wasabi, and benito shavings it was more of a savory appetizer, but when eaten alone it could pass off as a dessert.",

    "text": "Kyara is dope! Kyara was totally worth driving to if you're staying on the strip and have a rental car like we did. It's izakaya style food (bar food) so you know the portions are good and the prices are legit. The staff here are awesome. Super friendly and they all yell Japanese bar greetings at you when you enter and do the same as a fair well when you leave. It's a pretty cool touch.  The interior is all wood and super chic looking; very classy. The menu is well laid out and easy enough to figure out even if you have no idea what you're looking at (as was the case with me).  I had chicken tender skewers which were cooked and seasoned perfectly. They pulled right off the skewer with a minimum amount of effort. They weren't dry or chewy at all. I also had the koro beef which was fantastic. The beef was so tender and juicy. I seriously was not expecting it to be THAT good. I followed it up with the Sunset Roll which is spicy tuna inside the roll with albacore on top of the roll. It was made with skill and both fish tasted great. It's definitely a step above a lot of sushi rolls I've had elsewhere. One of my biggest sushi pet peeves is when they're made in a rush and fall apart when you try to pick them up with your chopsticks so you can actually, ya know, eat them. This was not a problem here at all! I ended the meal with my complimentary vanilla ice cream with green tea syrup (check in on Yelp for this tasty Yelp Deal). It was refreshing and tasty. The green tea syrup was the perfect addition to a decent scoop of vanilla ice cream. Really, I think vanilla is such a good flavor when trying to showcase a more subtle flavor like green tea or lavender. If you come to Vegas and love Japanese or Asian style cuisine and want some food prepared by skilled chefs for a great price then Kyara is your spot. It's worth every penny and every second of the round trip there and back to the strip.  I'm a fan!",

So it is not just the affect of alcohol on my hypothalamus making me more responsive to the aromas, although I do not mind that at all.  Great food and service with a pleasant environment keeps me coming back to Kyara and makes it the Izakaya restaurant I compare all other restaurants in this genre to.",

    "text": "Really disappointed in the service at the restaurant. My boyfriend and I have been craving Japanese tapas since we came back from Tokyo and this place looked great based on reviews. Wow were we wrong, I'm appalled by the service at Kyara.   We sat down and ordered our food, waited for 30 min and all that we got was miso soup. After waiting more they brought us half of our food. I noticed that we were the only  table that was given cheap wooden takeout chopsticks, after asking for the kind of chopsticks that the rest of tables had because they were better quality and not so flimsy, the waitress just brought me another pair of cheap ones. So we had to ask again!    Now our miso soup is supposed to come with rice which they forgot, so I asked for the rice we ordered and the waitress looked at me like I was crazy and only brought me one rice even though I asked for two for the second time.   So since we only got half of our meal and our rice came very late we still were trying to stay positive because the food did taste great. Unfortunately, this was not the last of our problems. So we waited and waited and waited for the rest of our food to come out and no one even came to check up on us until I had to flag someone down. I asked if the rest of our food was coming and the waiter looked confused. Yeah apparently they just forgot. Wow that was the last straw, I am a very patient and understanding person and I was very upset with the way my boyfriend and I were treated here.   The cherry on top was that it was not even busy and the other table next to us who came in after us got all of their food and were happy as clams.   I do not recommend this place to anyone.",

My favorites include: Yuzu Chili Salmon w/ Arugula Cabbage Ra-Yu--this is one of the tastiest raw cabbage dishes I've encountered! Inaniwa Udon Healthy Kushi Mori (Bonus tip--we always keep the Ra-Yu oil left over from the cabbage and used it to dress these veggies.)  I always make a point to check out their monthly specials as many of these items have been quite good.  They recently had a Tomato Nabe that was UNBELIEVABLY GOOD!  Another of my favorites was a Stuffed Shishito Pepper they were doing for a while.  Lots of friends are really into their lunch specials, but I don't ever make it in for lunch.  I am all about their small plates and skewers!   I wouldn't argue with anyone that wanted to give Kyara 5 stars.  I just think that they are not as good as it gets on multiple items that they serve.  In closing, please note that Japan has over 50,000 people who are over 100years old...widespread debate abounds as to the reason why.  Most assume that it is due to the use of toilet slippers to keep the rest of the house clean. Others point to Kancho on the playground, KFC on Christmas Eve, Yaeba, or Inemuri.  I have scientifically eliminated these ideas and narrowed it down to two possibilities: Soine-ya & Hadaka Matsuri.  I'll let you come up with your own conclusion though.",

Also the food is great especially the skewers- try the salted butabara. The service is always amazing. The servers are very attentive!!! It always very clean here too. If you and your friends cant decide where to eat at 10 pm come here!!!! You wont regret it",

Can you dock a restaurant for that? Yes! Because it wasn't big enough for me to move away from her. Even the people next to us stood outside with their food.   On to the food! This was solid. Everything on a stick was tasty - pork cheek, pork belly, chicken thigh, mushrooms, shishito peppers, ground chicken/pork. The jalapeno albacore was okay. The sushi roll was above average, but my boyfriend did eat sushi which is a small miracle in itself. Butter shrimp rice was very buttery. I loved the ponzu chicken!  Overall, I enjoyed the food!",

Some were a little over cooked :/   The garlic shrimp , kimchee pork, agedashi tofu , shitaki mushrooms , and the whole squid plate were my favorites .   Less than stellar - WSOP (smallest sushi roll I've ever had and very little fish), enoki mushroom , beef intestine skewer , salmon skin bowl , asparagus bacon , salmon sashimi bowl (tasted fishy) .   It takes a lot to get full with the small orders . So you end up spending a lot and it's too bad they weren't better .",

    "text": "Yummy! This place was absolutely delicious!   There was a 30 minute wait or so but we didn't mind. Once seated we ordered an abundance of tapas to share: pork belly skewers, kimchi pork, tuna poke, udon noodle, enoki bacon skewers, soft shell deep fried crab, baby squid with garlic, yellowtail collar, and ended with vanilla ice cream topped with green tea syrup.  The tapas were amazing. I really liked the kimchi pork (pork stir fried with kimchi) and probably could have ate another whole dish myself. I also really liked the baby squid (stir fried with asparagus and garlic, came with asparagus and had a blast of garlic flavor) and the hamachi collar (flaked in your mouth and came with a tangy ponzu sauce).  The service was good and our server was nice. The food came out very slowly and spread out. Our udon didn't come out until a hour later. At one point we were wondering if the udon was even going to come out...  If you check into Kyara on yelp, it tells you that you get a free appetizer. I showed our server the yelp offer and he said they no longer offered a free appetizer, but a free cocktail or dessert instead. We didn't mind and used it for the ice cream at the end of our meal. They definitely should update their offer!  Kyara has excellent Japanese tapas. The tapas did come out slow but the taste of the food outweighed our wait time. I left very satisfied and full. I came home and told my roommate about how good it was... I'll have to bring her next time!",

I had heard tons of great things about this place so was excited to try this place out. Sadly, as soon as we got there we realized it's not really a place for a group of people, we were only a group of 6. The restaurant is small, so after about 40 min we were sat. We got there in time for happy hour so we were actually able to try a lot of dishes.    Must trys: Yellowtail with jalapeno Tuna sashimi bowl Octopus dumplings (not the name on menu) Fried squid Mackarel sashimi salad  The salmon sashimi was really good and fresh!   Another thing that makes this place different is the variety of flavors they have for edamame! Definitely try the garlic butter, DELICIOUS!!  Service was pretty good,no real complaints. I'm not against going back again but probably wouldn't go with a group of people.",

    "text": "Another hidden gem of Las Vegas!  A perfect reason as to why you should rent a car and explore the delicious foods off of the Vegas Strip.  While Kyara may not be as easily accessible (a little hard to find) or celebrated as other izakaya places in Vegas, it is easily one of my top places to eat in Vegas, finishing BARELY behind Raku.  Kyara is an experience that you must try.  So on to the story.  I visited Las Vegas in March 2012 to play in an ice hockey tournament with my team/friends.  For some reason, I am the designated food person so after some calling around (it being almost 11pm by the time we had finished a game, showered and gotten ready), we decided on Kyara because, a) it was on my list of place to try, b) it was open late, and c) it could accommodate our large group of 15+.  Once at the restaurant, I had some skeptics, but once we ordered the food and ate in silence for the first 10 or so mins, the \"ooohhs\" and \"aaahhs\" and \"oh-my-effin-g that's good\" started blurting out.   Highlights of the menu that received extra orgasmic sounds of appreciation:  Maguro Carupaccio Hamachi Jalapeno (must order!) Age dashi Mochi Kaisen Chawanmushi (extra drool factor) Pork Kimchee Koro Koro Steak Butabara Skewer Gyutan Skewer (beef tongue is really good, you need to try it once) Enoki Bacon (extra drool factor)  So as you can tell, that is a crap load of food so I highly recommend to bring a group (at least four) and an appetite.    Another Vegas exploration success!",

We always love the spicy tuna w/rice crackers.    Don't go into Kyara expecting sushi, this is not a sushi bar.  They might have sushi or sashimi as a daily special.    ***Definitely hit them up for lunch.  Best meal under $10 in town.

    "text": "Beautiful and tranquil ambiance with good food.  On a Sunday evening I came in for dinner with a friend.  My friend, who is Asian, made this statement:  \"You know this place is good, look at all the Asians eating here.\"  While said in jest, she turned out to be spot on, because most everything we ate was delicious.   The decor is peaceful and clean in a minimalist fashion without being silly, featuring muted tones of bamboo, lots of straight lines, and an airy layout.    Since this is a tapas-style restaurant, it's best to order a whole bunch of stuff, and share like you're in Kindergarten.....and you're not selfish with the blocks and firetruck.    Here are some highlights of our meal:  Yellowtail w/ jalapeno and ponzu - This preparation is very common at Japanese restaurants lately, but that doesn't mean it isn't wonderful.  They finish the yellowtail sashimi off with a cilantro leaf, dash of Sriraucha, paper-thin jalapeno, and citrusy ponzu sauce.  Mmm-mmm good!  Spicy Tuna w/ rice crackers - The Crackers are really more like Japanese rice cakes, the healthy crunchy kind.  I thought the spicy tuna was light and tasty, but the rice cracker was too big and took away from the fish.  Still a good dish.   Agedashi - A perfectly flash-fried tofu in light soy broth w/ shredded daikon radish and other yummy accouterments.  Really, really good.    Chicken/Pork sausage skewer - This had a name although it escapes me.  It should be called stick-0-delish, because it was smoky, crispy, and wonderful.    Everything was spot on, from the food to the service.  I will definitely come back to get my dinner on soon.   ***Side note:  Apparently they have mouth wash in the girls bathroom.......so there's that.",

It didn't have a great sear on it and the flavor wasn't very pleasant.  I left most on the plate and ended up snacking later when I got home.",

And if you like plum wine, must try Kokuto Ume Shu!!!!!!!!! It's a blend of Japanese plum with brown sugar on ice rock. I was so in love with this plum wine after I had the first taste of it. Mmmmmm.. After my second visit, I still want to give it 2 thumbs up. It's so worth to drive 30 mins to here from the other side of town.",

This is not even a medium sized place. They have a few tiny table seating areas off of a main bar/kitchen area. It's all very nice. They yell something in Japanese(?) when you walk in and leave.  Our waiter was courteous and had good recommendations. We had two different \"Shochu\" drinks, I expect these are similar to the \"Soju\" beverages we had at Soyo that were so delectable.  The food was fresh and interesting. The veggie spring rolls were superb, The tempura was delightful and crisp, Garlic potatoes were excellent and I had a beefy sprouty dish that was spectacular. This is the first time I've had Japanese that wasn't Sushi (or burgers at Bachi), so please forgive my being unable to explain what it was, just know it was all very good.  My wife and I really enjoyed being that close to the kitchen (1.5 feet overlooking) and got to see the care of how everything was made.   We had food, drinks, alcoholic and non, and five Tapas for less than fifty bucks. I was impressed.",

We called and made reservations which is good because Ichiza doesn't do that.  On to the food.  We ordered a bunch of items.  Some of the notables were:  Pork Belly Skewers - I liked the one with sauce more than the salted one.  Definitely good to try Spicy tuna with cracker - Disappointing.  Wasn't spicy at all and the tuna had a strange consistency.   Kimchi with Pork - Good.  nothing really notable, but good. Stewed beef with potato - Really good.  Almost sukiyaki-esque.  One of my favorite dishes of the night Yellowtail with Chili - Very good.  Beautiful presentation and the flavors really accented each other well  The decor and presentation of the food was very nice.  The only down side was the service.  It was pretty slow and they missed some items that we ordered (but we were charged for them on the bill).  I caught the mistakes and got it fixed up.  Overall, good place to try out and share lots of different dishes, but I'll try to get Ichiza early next time.",

    "text": "Today was my third time to go to Kyara for lunch (gave them 5 stars on 12-6).  Guess what I ate.  A sandwich from Tropical Smoothie next door.  The first time I went to Kyara, I was seated quickly and had the best Japanese food I have had in Las Vegas.  The second time, there were two customers waiting in front of me in the foyer and it took way too long to be seated and even longer to get my food (which was great again).  Today, a group of 5 entered just before me.  We were waiting forever, all the while the waitress was doing a lot of nothing.  The counter was wide open and I asked if I could sit there and was told to wait.  She finally sat the group of 5, then ignored me for a few more minutes.  Then, she came and told me there were tons of orders and the wait for food would be really long.  All this at 11:55 a.m.  She basically told me to leave.  I love the food here and have heard the night menu really rocks but after living in Japan for 20 years, customer service rules supreme.  Bottom line is the kitchen can't keep up with the seating capacity and they try to stall when busy at lunch.  I'm really torn about going back to Kyara.  I love the food but hate being treated like they could give a shit about whether I do or don't.  I'll probably give it a month or so then try going a little earlier for lunch.  For today, however, I'm pissed.  All was not a wash.  It was my first time to try Tropical Smoothie and the sandwich and smoothie were both great.",

I said, ok, it's just me,I don't mind. She seemed annoyed. Girly, we are not starting off well here. She put me at a table for 2 with no silverware, no condiments (the cute S&P and soy sauce) that were on other tables. Really sured my mood. Anyway,I ordered the salmon miso combo. Salad was great. Miso was good. Tempura should have been hotter but was good. Salmon was yummy. But I  didn't love this place. Service wld have made this 4 star no doubt.

The location is very small to start with, few tables, and a few bar seats and that is it.   The last two times I've gone in before todays visit, its been super long waits just to get an order in, to get your drink refilled is next to impossible, but the food does come quick once ordered. I guess because they are so busy they have lost it in customer service. It took me twenty minutes to flag a waitress down just to pay my check on the previous visit, which is why I havnet been back for sometime. I went today and waited 10 minutes before a hostess would even make eye contact or ask how many in my party, then told me it would be about 15 to 20 more minutes to get seated. I left being that I'm on my lunch hour and all. I'm frustrated with the lack of service they have here. I told myself I wouldn't be coming here any time soon the last time I went and now I will definately not go back to this place at all,  the food is not superb or anything its just good, but not worth the wait or frustration.",

The atmosphere is great, they have a very modern interior which is both intimate with music to match the setting. It makes you feel like you just stepped foot in Japan. The food is absolutely fantastic! They have different specials every time we go, which is about once a week and they taste heavenly! If you're the flavor over portion person, which is the actual Japanese dining style, you will not be disappointed. But if you are in need of a fill up after a period of fasting, it may be costly since the portions are designed to enjoy the flavor of each and every dish rather than filling up.They bring you unique and tasty \"otoshi\" in the beginning to start off which is a bite size but tasty. My personal fave are their delicious ham-katsu(which i can't find anywhere!), yakitori (tsukune and negima) and yamaimo somen (potato noodles), zukedon (maguro bowl) yum! If you're in the area, it 's definitely worth a try.",

After reading the reviews, I became hesitant to try it, but I decided to go as the chefs had a positive feedback. Thank goodness for listening to them, because the food was delicious and authentic!! I am Japanese, so it really reminded me of a high quality izakaya in Tokyo. Everything we ordered was so well-balanced: seafood chawan-mushi, age-mochi, niku-tofu, halibut tempura with shiso and cheese, buta-kimchee....all the kushi-yaki was great, sashimi platter was beautifully presented and was fresh. I mean, it was a real pleasant surprise. We wanted to order more but we were so full from trying so many things. Nothing was a disappointment. In conclusion, I am a fan of this place and I'm super glad that the other reviews did not deter me from checking out this place.",

My boyfriend and his family we all went out a hour before they closed and the food put me in food coma!  There are skewer type food, shrimp tempura, the price isn't too bad after splitting it between everyone, this is our new spot though now that there menu is better. We got fish macro, chicken keruge (I'm not sure how to spell it), spicy edamame, shrimp tempura, pork cheek skewers, pork and chicken skewers, corn cheese (which was okay I've had better), I keep forgetting what those squid ball thing is called.  And there's a bar next door so you can go there after and chit chat with your friends! :)",

Tsukune is a must try with cage free egg. We also love yuzu chilli salmon salad, yellowtail jalapeno carpaccio. Saki ika tempura, and sausage are delicious. Mini udon and some of their seasonal noodle are always good options to try. Finally house sushi rolls we've tried all of them and everything is amazing our favorite is dejavu. Seasonal dishes are always good to try as well. Overall, you will never be disappointed coming here.",

The bathrooms even have mouth wash for you freshen your breath after you eat. There are about 10 seats MAX at the bar top & maybe 8 tables of 4 around the restaurant. They also have an open kitchen so it could get pretty loud when the rush comes.  The staff is attentive but they really need to work on smiling a bit & greeting people when they walk through the door. They kind of seem like they don't wanna be working. But regardless they are attentive so I don't really expect much of GREAT MEMORABLE service from this joint. The food makes up for it.   This is another izakaya Japanese restaurant which is like small plates.  KORO KORO STEAK $14.80 - literally OBSESSED w/ this dish. so MUCH FLAVOR & I love the bean sprouts that I like to eat w/ a bowl of rice.

I have to say that I'm a huge fan of the interior design of the establishment. It's got a beautiful contemporary Japanese aesthetic, but it has a essence of a relaxed and laidback atmosphere just like any other izakaya.   They have an extensive menu catered to both Japanese and Western tastes. There are a lot of traditional Japanese dishes like chawan mushi and niku jaga, but there are plenty of other creative options such as koro koro steak, garlic potatoes, and spicy edamame. Not to mention they have a great selection for yakitori and sushi.   I personally love their ika geso age (fried marinated squid legs) and tori karaage (Japanese fried chicken). Both lightly battered and fried, accompanied by subtly sweet and savory flavors.   There's just so much to try here, so if you're feeling adventurous, this is the place to go.",

    "text": "So much I can say about this place. It's entry from outside seems small and unnoticeable being next to Tropical Smoothie. However, you step in to a small comfortable \"waiting area\" with walls decorated with recognition awards and articles from local papers. Good impression so far. Without waiting long, a host/hostess seated my party of 8. We immediately get greeted by everyone in the kitchen which is pretty cool. Hmm, getting better.  Eight people. Eight hungry bellies. We ordered so much that I don't even remember the names. We got the $14 special sushis on the sushi menu, mini bowls of udon, hamachi collar, garlic ponzu chicken, pork belly skewers, salmon skin salad, salmon sashimi bowl, hamachi with jalepeno, a chicken rice bowl from the \"Favorites\" menu, tofu mousse, matcha green tea ice cream, green tea waffles, and some others.   Let me say- DELICIOUS. Every dish had its own distinctive flavor. It never crossed my mind that anything was too sour or too salty or too acidic. The dishes were well balanced. Every dish with fish was fresh. The hamachi jalepeno and tuna carpaccio almost melted in my mouth. The sushi had the same kick with small amount of rice to hold it together. The one with spicy tuna with the picture on the bottom of that menu was my favorite.  Next to my group were others enjoying themselves- men drinking and eating skewers, laughing loudly together, a group of women dressed up for a girl's night out, couples on the other side of the restaurant on dates. Izakaya is meant to be a bar with small plates to socialize. The service was great; I noticed that one employee was set aside to watch my dining area for water and tea refills. Empty plates never stayed on table for long. For the variety of foods, service, and quality, this place I'm in love. It is really worth the splurge.",

    "text": "I think Kyara might be my new favorite place! I didn't know what to expect as a lot of my friends had mixed reviews, but I am so glad I came and tried it out! I had made reservations for 4 of us and we were seated right away!  My favorites of the meal: 1. Niku Tofu (This is so delicious with rice and I could probably eat this all day, for person like me who doesn't like tofu (surprising right?) this was my favorite) 2. Asparagus wrapped in bacon (flavor was awesome and aspargus was crispy but easy to eat) 3. Ika Butter (Yummy squid!) 4. Mini Udon (this mini was a pretty good portion size and I love that the udon wasn't \"thick\") 5. Koro Koro Steak (tender steak, but lots of garlic if you don't like garlic don't get it!) 5. Both the Chocolate Fondant and Maccha Mousse were delish! I ordered the Maccha Mousse and the green tea sauce was fabulous. The chocolate fondant would have been to rich for me after the 3rd bite, but it's pretty good if you love lava cakes!  I tried a couple of other skewers, pork belly, mushrooms, etc.  I wasn't too impressed with the pork belly, but I had gotten it salted without the sauce. I wasn't in the mood for the proteins! The onigri had too much rice, but I think overall I got to try a bunch of dishes that I loved (Go Niku Tofu!)! Service was attentive enough! Cute place, but I didn't care for the stools that we were sitting in, no back support. Nevertheless I will be back sooner than later!",

I heard many times from customers exclaiming that they ordered a long time ago. It's sad that on a anniversary night they wouldn't plan a little more knowing that they may be busy. Ahh theyre probably slow most of the time so they dont know how to handle being busy. Next we find out that they are no longer serving ayce after 10pm. Strange/dishonest as this is not mentioned on any advertisement. People like this make me sick. Irresponsible,dishonest, and arrogant. The hostess never apologized for any wrong doing or confusion. She just smirked and walked away when I told her that she ruined our night and wasted our time. Lucky you opened here in Las Vegas. In Japan you wouldn't make it. Here its like taking candy from a baby. Getting rich off off the low standards of this city.",

    "text": "It's sad that I didn't give Kyara a try earlier, as it is merely a few minutes from where I live. Japanese Tapas has always been a little intimidating to me, as I don't really know what I'm ordering a lot of the time. I've been missing out -  The food at Kyara is excellent, as far as I can tell. There is time and effort put into a lot of their dishes, along with quality ingredients. I've now tried nearly a dozen of their different items, though there are still many more to be tried. My favorite at this point was a simple chicken and rice bowl called Tori Meshi. Uncomplicated to say the least, but still very delicious.  The Chicken Garlic Ponzu is also truly tasty. It has strong flavors that jump out at you, but is unique enough that it is intriguing. Another excellent dish was the Yuzu Chili Salmon Salad. The salmon is very lightly seared and the texture of the dish is amazing, as well as the presentation.  Some other highlights so far have been the deep fried cheese, which while straight forward, was tasty and had some nice variety of cheese. Their pork belly skewer is average, while the Negi Ma (chicken and green onion)  skewer was very tasty. The sasami (chicken breast) was not as good, as it really was just a piece of chicken on a skewer. I also tried the bacon mochi skewer, which, while interesting, wasn't necessarily that strong of a combination.  I would probably pass on the potato salad, which really was just that, and the Niku Jaga was good but also just seemed like sukiyaki. Still, there are many dishes that I would like to try.  It is definitely worth noting that their desserts are extremely good and priced very cheaply, in my opinion. The Yuzu Fromage Mousse is really quite amazing, as is the Green Tea Waffle, which is enough for 3-4 people and only costs around 5 dollars.  Service here is a little on the slow side, which is really my only knock on the place. A table was ready and we were asked to sit for a good 5 minutes for no real reason other than they had some trouble keeping up with the crowd. I'm not sure if that's a normal situation, or if they are short one or two servers during the busy hours.  All in all, Kyara is a very good and reasonably priced option for those desiring to try a multitude of Japanese-influenced flavors, and I see myself returning here many times for it's convenience to my location as well as its excellent food.",

When we came in the server was nice and greeted us and sat us down. When we looked at their drink menu we noticed it looked just like Naked fish's menu and come to find out they're are the same company. I love naked fish too.   OKAY. So we order the usual foods:  Fried shrimp  Chicken karaage Clams with sake Chicken with ponzu  Fried Ramen noodles Sunomono Ebiyako ( I think I spelled it wrong)  Beef tongue  Well everything was honestly okay. The clams and soup was very bland. The noodles were really salty but savory. The only thing that was really bad was the shrimp balls (Ebiyako). When we ordered it we thought it was shrimp balls because the waitress said shrimp in a ball. When you bite into it, it's a really chewy like a rice ball with a potato feel to it. I don't know me and my boyfriend didn't like it at all. But the server was nice enough to take it back and exchange for something else!   Overall, the service was good and the food was mehhhhh.",

The most tasty items we ordered weren't on sticks, but were in those fajita skillets. CHEESY, BUTTERY CORN, GARLIC POTATO (tots), and GARLIC PONZU CHICKEN. We ordered so much food and ate EVERYTHING.

Bring some friends, order a whole bunch of different things to try, maybe get some beer or sake too, and end up with a $33 pre-tip split.  That's the thing I guess. Coming from someone who's used to getting as many small portions as he wants (Vegas-style AYCE sushi) dinner here is not quite my style, and it can (and did) get a little pricey. There are certainly a lot of nice things going on though. Salmon and Ikura Don was great. Enoki Bacon (bacon-wrapped mushrooms) was a total treat. I remember both the Hamachi Jalapeno and the Maguro Carpaccio being delicious. The Koro Steak was pretty good too. And the Yuzu Fromage Mousse was a sweet and citrus-y delight that I have never had the pleasure of enjoying before.  I guess pretty much anything veggie-only didn't do it for me, but the worst offender was the Gobo chips. I don't know how much nutritional value was in those fried roots, but if you compress them down, it just seems like way too much to pay for something so decidedly not filling.  I kinda wanna try that lunch menu that I've been reading about on other reviews. The combination of flavors and value might change my own tune.",

First off the wait staff, hostess, and manager, George, were wonderful, friendly, patient, accommodating and helpful.  George tried to appease me and he did a good job as he only charged me for the iced Oolong tea which was delicious.  Evidently the daytime lunch menus differ greatly from the weekend dinners!  The same dishes were served completely different.  I couldn't order my favorite Ramon Noodles as it was unavailable at lunch time.  So I tried a noodle soup that I did not like.  It was bland and the chef couldn't or wouldn't add any type of meat to it.  Very disappointing.  The cucumber salad was just sliced cucumbers no flavoring, sauce or seasoning.  I mean just sliced cucumber!  Yuk!  Another bland and boring taste sensation.  The free Edamame which the sweet, friendly, helpful waitress helped me (I'm rather low tech) text was just the Edamame.  Again no seasonings or sauce.  I brought them home and plan on adding the needed sauces and spices for my dinner tonight.  I did gently complain to George because the experience was so unusual and disturbing.  I asked if there was a new chef which I was told no.  Maybe I was too demanding requesting the normal dishes.  Like I said the staff were great but avoid this place for lunch.  If you like the restaurant go on weekends.  Skip it for lunch!",

    "text": "I joined my fiance and his two colleagues for dinner a couple weeks ago. The three of them had dined here together previously, so they knew exactly what to order and I allowed them to do the work.  Including dessert, we shared sixteen (16) different dishes, also ordering multiples of certain dishes. Everything was really great! I'm not going to list everything we had since I posted a photo of each dish with accompanying prices.  The dishes I really enjoyed were Ika Geso Age, Tsukune, Wild Horse Mackerel, Santa Barbara Uni, Iwagaki Oyster, and Ika Geso Itame. The two baby squid dishes (Ika Geso) were really awesome. The \"Age\" preparation was lightly battered and fried, just perfect with the fresh, chewy texture. The \"Itame\" preparation was sauteed with garlic and asparagus. So, so good! The Mackerel: I love when restaurants choose a fish for their specials and serve it in different ways on one plate - this one was sashimi, nigiri, and poke. The uni was super creamy, yummy and the oyster was delicious! I enjoyed the Maccha Waffle (green tea flavor) because it was light and not overly sweet for a dessert.  The only items I didn't care for were the Kawa (chicken skin), Benasu (eggplant), and Chocolate Fondant. There wasn't anything wrong with the chicken skin, but definitely nothing special. Same with the eggplant. It was two pieces of eggplant on a stick..not exciting. The Chocolate Fondant has a deceptive name because it's not actually fondant, but similar to a chocolate lava cake. We inquired about it since I figured no one would actually serve fondant, so we ordered it based on a raving recommendation from our server. It was unfortunately bland.  Overall, the seafood was fresh and tasty! The prices are very reasonable as well with items as low as $1.80. It's such a great experience to go with a group of friends and share a bunch of dishes (tapas in general); it allows you to try items you may not traditionally invest in. Great menu, but definitely check out the specials - all the winning items are on there!",

    "text": "They were one of the first in Vegas (that I can recall) to do Japanese tapas/small plates. Food here is good, but the restaurant is small so there is often a wait, even on weeknights.  I like the ika butter, pork kim chee, koro koro steak and ochazuke. Because they're small portions, you need to order a few things (if hungry), but it tends to add up. Our average check for 2 people, no alcohol, is usually around $50-$60.  However, my favorite item to get here is probably their macha/green tea waffle with ice cream and honey for dessert. Different and delicious!",

    "text": "Very similar to its sister restaurant Naked Fish, but I find the menu more authentic and open. I decided to try some unusual dishes in terms of American sushi so I went with grilled full fish, grilled squid, and a seaweed salad.  The menu items took a little longer than I expected considering there were only 2 groups f people in house and 6+ chefs.  I received the seaweed salad first and it was great.  It was a 4 parter with jellyfish, cucumber, seaweed, and ginger.  A very nice addition for only $3. The fish reminded me of large scale anchovies.  Super crunchy and delicious for only $3.50.  Finally the squid ($8) was prepared perfectly, and although I didn't enjoy it that much, it wasn't the restaurant's fault.  It just wasn't eery flavorful as it was just fresh squid in some miso sauce.  If this place is anything like Naked Fish, then I will surely be back for the epic HH after 10pm to enjoy quality dishes and sake for cheap.  The restaurant is a little o ut of the way for me but whenever I'm on the south west side of town late night Kyara will be near the top of my list.",

I was excited to find a yakitori bar in Vegas after watching hours of No Reservations and Bizarre Foods.  I'm surprised to see all of the 5 stars for this place so maybe I missed something, but I thought it was mediocre at best.  We had a party of five and I was not overly impressed with any particular dish.  It was pretty pricey too, so the value really wasn't there.  We tried everything, and the bacon wrapped asparagus was the best thing (although it didn't compare to the ones I had at the night market in Taipei).  Bengal BBQ's bacon asparagus at Disneyland was even more memorable.  The skewers, yuzu salmon, beef tongue, koro steak...all okay, but honestly nothing too memorable.  Service and atmosphere was excellent and they're open late, but it was just ok to me.",

I was excited to try this place bc it's closeby in SW and I dont have to drive to China/Korea Town if I wanna grab a quick bite. Well, maybe I had my hopes up too high? or maybe I was expecting it to be similar to Ichiza? For ppl who are \"used to\" Ichiza, dont expect this place to deliever the types of tapas and the fun Japanese-street-style-restaurant atmosphere here.   They had many varities of tapas for sure, but many tastes similar...salt or terriyaki flavor. The portion is small...all the dishes are like the size of a palm, literally. And they are on the pricier side. The quality and freshness were there but not the usual Tapas I was used to. Guess I'll still be driving down to Spring Mtn afterall~",

The tempura is good since its lightly battered... Some places uses way too much...  The nasu dengaku was good for those who like eggplant...  Tori meshi is yums even though its small.  The age mochi had a really good broth but eat it fast... The tsukune was ok...the tsukune at Raku is better...  Another good dish was the ika butter...everyone enjoyed...

Our next order was Asari saka mushi (a very small portion of very small clams in sake, 1 Fork), Age dashi tofu (deep fried tofu with special sauce, 3 Forks) and Agedashi Nasu (deep fried eggplant with special sauce, 4 Forks).  The last order was yuzu fromage mousse (a homemade citrus mousse, 3.5 Spoons).  Portion size for each was small so I imagine those with large appetites could run up a sizeable bill.",

My friend and I both ordered their chicken katsu curry, which was quite delicious. Their curry was very flavorful and you could actually taste the beef in it. I also like that they kept the slices of vegetable as wholes and didn't mince it like some other places do. Their curry also has beef in it, something we weren't expecting since we ordered chicken katsu! But it was so delicious nonetheless. Katsy was crispy and juicy, definitely not rubbery like a lot of places.  We didn't try the tapas but came for only a modest lunch, and it was quite delicious!  4 stars for now, just because we only tried one thing off the menu. When I come again, I'm sure it'll be 5!",

    "text": "Last night was my second time dining at Kyara. I was so excited for my return visit and to take my husband and daughter there. We decided to go for our wedding anniversary. The food was delicious. We tried plenty of dishes such as the albacore carpaccio and agedashi tofu and a few new items such as the Gobo Chips (Fried Burdock) and Spicy Tuna dip with rice crackers. Our 3 year old ate almost the entire order of the Spicy Tuna dip.  We then decided to place a second order of the Spicy Tuna dip. Either they had forgotten and didn't put the order in or it was really taking a long time to make the item. It's RAW! I have no idea because when I brought it up, the didn't seem to answer my question. The same thing happened with the ice cream. We ordered ice cream and it took a very long time. When the ice cream finally arrived, we were told the mochi I ordered wasn't available. I should have been informed right away. The communication was lacking which means the service was poor. The entire dining \"experience\" was TWO hours long which was unacceptable for the amount of food we ordered! And, sadly, there was a table next to us with about 5 people who are all in the restaurant business. They didn't receive their desserts and left pretty unhappy as well. So unhappy that NO tip was left by people who are also food servers! Providing good service is everything. Your food may be delicious but if you can't provide excellent service, your guests won't return. Maybe it was an off night but you're usually given only one chance to make an impression. I hope the entire team goes through some additional training to really improve their service.",

    "text": "I've been to Kyara a few times prior to revisiting it this weekend.  This is one of those places I enjoyed quite a bit, but since it's not exactly close to me it falls off my radar.   That is, until I constantly see half of my Yelp friends list checking into it every other weekend and seemingly having the time of their lives while I sit at home crying into a sad, lonely bowl of chex mix.  But I digress.     So I found a friend to hang out with me on Saturday before we ventured to another friend's house, and convinced him to go to Kyara with me.  Once there the first thing I noticed was how quiet it was, when I had been used to it being fairly crowded in previous visits.  It's possible it was too early (7 pm on a Saturday?) because it did seem to pick up as time went on.     I decided fairly quickly to just throw caution to the wind and not really worry about a) how much we ordered and b) how $much$ we ordered.  Boy, dining does get a lot more enjoyable this way even though it's not particularly a realistic way to live.  We ordered quite a bit, and I'm going to attempt to rank them from worst to best because it's simply more dramatic that way.     1) Blue Cheese Potato Salad:   I don't know, I had all the hope in the world for this and thought it was bland.   Maybe it was a bad batch, but I could barely taste blue cheese NOR potato.  How is that possible?   Your guess is as good as mine.   My friend started to like it more with every beer he drank.  Take that for what it's worth.  I also tried it after some sake and beer and it didn't help it at all for me 2) Sunset Roll - according to the website this is a \"temporary menu from Naked Fish\"?  For $12 it was uninspired and worse than ANY roll I've had at Sushi-Mon's All You Can Eat.  It was removed from the table with still 3-4 pieces left 3) Those thin fried chicken chips.   I thought they were okay, but that there were much better a) fried and b)chicken options 4) Ham Katsu - I thought this was pretty tasty, but not very exciting.  Tastes exactly what it sounds like 5) Maccha Affogato (dessert) - Okay this tasted really good, but the reason it's this low is that if you're going to order this, you might as well just go with the green tea waffle which is EXTRAORDINARY 6) Bacon wrapped asparagus skewer - I've had this before when it was much, much better.  This time the portion sizes were much smaller.   Still tasted okay 7) Miso Soup - Standard 8) Chicken Wing Skewer - About what you'd expect, which is not a bad thing.  Much preferred the \"Sauce\" version over \"Salt\" 9) Deep fried squid tentacles - Very tasty, excellently seasoned, just chewy enough 10) Gobo Chips - a must order for me each time.  Burdock root ftw! 11) Pork Belly skewer - I'm always a sucker for Pork Belly.  Much prefer the \"salt\" version over \"sauce\" on this one 12) Pork with Kimchi - to be fair, I love pork, and I love kimchi.  If you don't I'm guessing this isn't for you.   13) Green tea waffle (dessert) - Good lord I wasn't prepared for this.  I don't typically order desserts, but this was one of the better ones I've had in quite some time 14) Cheese Tempura (x2) - This is by far my favorite thing here and something I've had to order each visit, usually twice, since day 1.  You get three different cheeses tempura style and they are usually brought out all hot and gooey, just the way you like it.    Next time:  gobo chips and friend squid to start, some skewers, pork with kimchi, and cheese tempura with maybe a few more new items to try and finishing it off with the green tea waffles.  Service was fine, though our waitress did seem a little unfriendly (unfriendly might be a little harsh, maybe indifferent is a better word) at times.  Food came out piping hot and drinks were refilled quickly which is the most important part.    As I explained to my friend this is the type of place that you just need to keep visiting until you've tried nearly everything on the menu.   By that point you will wind up with a 5 star experience each and every time in regards to the food.  I'm getting there Kyara!",

Their lunch special is very cheap. All in all, I ended up ordering the Sashimi lunch combo (I don't like shrimp so they were kind enough to switch it for another fish). The food wasn't memorable... My friend actually ended up ordering the curry and took the leftovers home so I'm going to safely assume it was oyshii desu.  Friend went back later that week for the tapas and loved it! I have yet to try.",

We showed up at 12AM, ordered 24 dishes amongst the 4 of us, and we didn't leave until 230AM.  It took far too long to get served certain dishes, and it was not because they were busy...we we're only one of two tables.  But nonetheless, the food was fantastic. Nothing really disappointed at all.",

I just have to offer some constructive criticism with one item Only thing that we didn't care for was the butabara. I recommend you have your cooks braise this before they grill or slice much thinner. Very tough and chewy. Believe me I love texture, but this dish needs to be reexamined.   Definitely finish off with the grilled onigiri in broth.   Much better than Ichiza. Similar in concept to Raku but different styles of cooking and different dishes. Raku chef is top notch talented, but his staff are all snobs. Service at Kyara was very attentive and consistent.  Also the atmosphere and the decor is very warm, inviting, modern and clean.   You guys are doing a great job. I will be back on a regular basis.",

We had three kinds of capaccio (salmon, albacore, mackerel), fried tofu, beef stew, clams, grilled fish collar, tofu mousse, etc. We ordered so many dishes that I can't recall all of them.

It took her a few moments to speak and rather than a smiling welcome she tersely asked if we had a reservation. We did not. With her mouth agape in disgust she had to see someone else. Every table was empty. She returned and said, \"They need some time.\" A Japanese group walked in and was immediately greeted enthusiastically by the hostess and some of the chefs. We were never greeted at all and decided to leave. The hostess was quite rude. Can't comment on the food. We wanted to try the place because of the great reviews. The Yelp listing did not note the requirement to have a reservation nor does the web site. Will not return.",

The lunch menu is simple and works more like combos. I ordered their Sashimi Lunch Combo and the fish was fresh and delicious. I'm a big fan of red tuna. Being from Vancouver I've eaten a lot of Sashimi and the quality is just the same.   I enjoyed their tempura, it was light, crispy, but didn't feel too oily. And usually this is why I'm not a big fan of Tempura. But I would definitely eat it again from Kyara.   If i'm in Vegas again, I'll definitely try to come back here for the Tapas. People keep raving about it.",

    "text": "Now this was the visit I was wanting from my previous visit.  Flavors were delicate, yummy and textures were there!  For the first time, I thought that the bomb items would naturally come from the \"special\" menu, but this time, we went with the gut feeling and ordered more instinctively from the main menu.  This time is was truly good.  Bonus appetizer: *Deep fried yamaimo (Mountain Potato) - It was like eating delicate fries.  The potato had tempura batter and very lightly salted.  Crispy and delicious!  *Albacore w/Drew Special and Tuna Carpaccio- I'm going to group this dish with the Tuna Carpaccio in terms of flavor.  Both had tangy sauce that complimented the tuna.                                 *Agedashi Tofu - Kyara makes a slighty darker and saltier sauce, but I appreciated the delicately fried tofu cubes. *Eggplant Steak - This was on the saltier side, but I enjoyed it overall *Butabara - Bacon slices on a stick!!!!  Being the piggies that we are, we ordered one order each of the salt and soy sauce/terikyaki-ish versions.  I'm a lover of most things greasy and bacon. This was a winner and the soy sauce version was the overall winner of the two. *Kaisen Chawanmushi (steamed egg custard with seafood) - This was probably our favorite of the evening.  The steamed egg custard was perfectly salty infused with the essences of the seafood within it.  Slurped it all up. *Chicken Garlic Ponzu - This is basically a super tender pice of chicken cutlet with my fav flavors of garlic and ponzu. *Tori Meshi - soboro (seasoned ground chicken) with rice, hearty rice and seasoned chicken.  Good!  Conclusion:  I am warming up to Kyara.  It's definitely not Raku caliber Japanese tapas, but it will do if you forget to make a reservation for Raku.",

The highlights - the salmon and the albacore but sis and i agreed they cut the fish too thin.    Average - The grilled items were over salted which is surprising since i love salt ! Pork belly - a little on the dry side - that's surprising.  Chawanamushi - the custard texture didn't agree with me - the seafood was good.  the lows -  The grilled squid was terrible - my jaw was sore from all the chewing !

The decor is neat and you'll feel like you are on a dining adventure sitting in the nifty closed off tables.    I really like the list of specials.  I love knowing that if I went back, I could dine on essentially a whole new menu.  They had lots of items on special that seem to change daily.    There were hits and misses.  The good news with eating this way is if you don't love a dish, it is only a few bites to choke down.... The standouts were a tempura cheese trio with fig jam, and a grilled steak and onion sizzling platter (koro koro steak.)  I quite enjoyed my cocktail - a mango soju soda.  Sweet and tasty.  The rest of the food we ordered was OK - and we ordered our fair share of items.    It's definitely worth the trip for the experience of a fun exotic foodie adventure in a cute place.    In my opinion, the food left a bit to be desired and I don't see myself running back for any one dish.  I am happy we went though! No regrets.    Much like other \"tapas\" style places.  The bill reflects your gusto.  It is easy to get carried away and get smacked with a total over $50 a person.  I advise that your order slowly to minimize the sticker shock.  We exercised pretty serious restraint so we only ended up paying $130 for the 4 of us.",

Tonight we tried the Koro Koro steak, medium rare~ very tender, the sauce and juices that sit in the bottom of the dish is so flavorful, especially with the bean sprouts and fresh daikon gave it a nice fresh touch.  Also had their daily special which was Uni nigiri from Japan they said.. But none the less one of the freshest and sweetest Uni I've tried in Vegas so far   The service was quick and very friendly.. Also attentive and polite.  The food wait is rather lengthier than normal but having a few of their highball Hibiki whiskeys and time will fly by.   All in all fantastic spot to for dinner and drinks. Will definitely be going back again soon!!",

They have the roppongi roll I'm addicted to, and a very extensive menu. We got their pork kimchi stir fry, unagi kabayaki, tori kara age, a couple rolls, and they have a maccha waffle.  I shouldn't be eating this, but I did, and I regret nothing! It's a maccha waffle with vanilla ice cream and strawberry sorbet, served with syrup and butter.  This is one of the best desserts I've ever had anywhere at anytime.",

I remember bookmarking Kyara a while back because of Anthony's ROTD and I wanted that curry katsu that he had a pic of but forgot to order it. Next time...tomorrow lunch LOL.  I love places with those order slips that all you need to do is write the quantity of the item you want and just wait for what you get cause its like a surprise when the food comes out.  What came first was my Maguro Carpaccio $7.50, yummy, I folded each piece so that there was crispy center with every bit. That with the sauce the maguro pieces came with very delicious. I should've ordered another serving but I didn't really remember what I ordered.  Some miso soup $2.00 came next, I need some soup since I was in a frozen work environment all day I wasn't feeling good all day and that did me some good.  Some soft shell crab $5.80 and tempura squid $4.20 reminds me of something I would eat back home all was missing was the beach and some beer but YES another delicious eats.  The butabara pork belly came out I already knew it was gonna be good so I sampled a piece and saved the best for last. Crispy and firm just the way I like my pork belly delicious for only $2.20 I also should've ordered more of this. Enoki Bacon $2.30 also was good.  For dessert I did the Maccha Affogato best way to end my dinner. Ice cream is always the best thing to eat if its 100+ outside even if its not its always something good.  I like Kyara I'd be back definitely. Excellent service and food. Nice decoration. Both bar and table dining.",

We ordered everything from each section of the menu which included appetizers, fried foods, yakitoris, grilled foods, rice foods, dessert and the even the specials. Most of food we ordered was delicious, but the yakionirigi, chawan mushi and matcha affogato was mediocre. The rice in the yakionigiri was mushy and didn't even have a shape anymore, the chawan mushi was very bland and didn't have much umami. The matcha affogato was just vanilla ice cream with matcha syrup. It was alright.  The service was okay; I had to ask for water a bunch of times and had to even raise my voice at times for the server to come. The AC was also broken so it was extremely hot. The server warned us, but we drove all the way there so we wanted to eat there. It's 105 degrees outside so it should be fixed asap. I really hope they will get that done soon! Also, making a reservation might be good!",

I would recommend anything on the skewer menu, chicken wing with salt, and pork belly with sauce are all fantastic. For those of you who are not carnivores, shiitake mushrooms and asparagus without the bacon are awesome. The sushi is mediocre to anything you can find in Chinatown.

Ikura salmon don- in addition, the salmon was fresh and fatty.  Highly recommend   Sushi- sashimi fresh and good flavor.  Only the slice was way too small  Could be a little pricey.  But coming from LA where we are naturally spoiled with good Japanese food, this is worth a try when you are visiting LV.",

We sat st the counter with the chef and got to speak to him about where the fish comes from in Tokyo. They bring in alot of their proteins from Tsukiji fish market in Tokyo as well as Toyuso the new market.  We had a bottle of Fuji Apple Sake. We had the seaweed salad and kimchi to start followed by the tuna carpaccio. We moved to the sashimi sampler and the spiced kyara wings.  The next thing items we tried were the sunset roll, the special kyara roll and then the grilled octopus. Everything was wonderfully prepared and instantly brought out. The service is always so engaging and friendly. Mariella was taking care of us and is genuinely caring and concerned about her guests experience. What a wonderful dining experience. Not to be missed in Las Vegas.",

    "text": "We we're coming back from a seminar and wanted to try something new. We weren't super hungry so after a quick yelping we found Kyara.  It was early evening so the place wasn't too busy and we were seated immediately. The interior was cozy and very .....Japanese?  Anyhow, the server gave us a few minutes and took our orders. Before I describe what we got and our thoughts, I have to say that the service is good, but the pacing of the tapas coming out is ....???.....how would I put it...???.....leisurely. Not slow, but I not fast either.  Here's what we ordered: Buta Bara (pork belly skewer) - This was delicious. Seasoned with salt, tender, succulent, and crispy on the sides. Get this. Chawan Mushi (steamed egg custard with seafood) - This was tasty, but the portion was very small. Get this, but be prepared to wish the bowl was larger. Gyu Motsu Kushi (beef intestines) - Tasty with the soysauce. Meat was tender, but not as tender as the Buta Bara Gyutan (beef tongue) - Good. Grilled nicely. Flavorful. Get or Pass on this. Motsu Ni (pork intestine stew) - This had way more tofu than pork intestines. Broth was good. Overall the dish was maybe a 3/5. It should be called Tofu and Vegetable Stew (featuring pork intestines). Pass on this. Onigiri Sake Yaki (grilled Onigiri with salmon) - This was okay. If you can imagine grilled rice balls with salmon inside then you can imagine what this tastes like. Pass on this. Ton Toro (pork cheek skewer) - This was a little more tough, but still very tasty. Salty and good. Get or Pass on this. Zaru Soba (cold soba noodles with dipping sauce) - This was tasty, but not outstanding. I've had soba at other places and this is on par with those. Buckwheat noodles were fine and dipping sauce is standard issue. Get or pass on this.  Food quantity was about right for tapas, but if you're hungry for a large meal and don't want to pay too much then I wouldn't recommend a tapas place. The total bill for us ran about $49 before tip and it filled two of us up on a day where we weren't super hungry so I imagine the bill could easily run into $60-70 if we ordered a few more items. I don't believe I'll be back here simply because I didn't feel I got a good bang for my buck food quantity-wise. Taste overall was good though. So I rate this place a 4 overall, but I'm not a fan.",

This place is pretty pricey for dinner, but the quality is great and the food is delicious. Definitely recommend the Kyara Popper which is a better version of a jalapeno popper and their sushi.   For lunch, however, the price is just right. For around the $10 - $15 price point, you get miso soup, salad, a selection of shrimp and veggie tempura with your choice of protein. It's an amazing option in terms of quality and quantity.   I think the only thing I'd skip here is their dessert since I was not a big fan of their matcha waffle. It lacked that gloriously crispy texture and was much more spongey than I had hoped for.",

    "text": "AMAZING food!!!  My husband and I are in town for the week and wanted to try an izakaya.  We first went to Raku.  It was 6:40pm on a Saturday and most of their tables are empty but they said that they were booked up with reservations and they couldn't seat us till 12:30am.  I asked if they could recommend any other izakayas and they said no.    I remembered looking up Kyara online but couldn't remember the name - doh!  Luckily my husband remembered a unique dish the \"Stir fried squid with butter\", otherwise known as Ika Butter.  He looked it up and found Kyara - and we called immediately to reserve a table - thankfully they had an opening and accommodated us.  We immediately drove over to a very small strip mall that was dark and off the beaten path.  While the location was questionable, we were immediately put to rest when we entered - the decor was great, very clean and Japanese, great staff that greeted us and seated us right away at a table that fit 4 instead of the smaller table that they could have easily sat us at.  The kitchen is open and very clean.  We were famished after a 10 hour drive from the Bay Area that morning.  We ordered the following dishes: Salmon skin and onion salad special - good, but tiny portion and compared to Geta's (Oakland) salmon skin salad it wasn't as good, but still good  1. Salmon chili salad with arugula special - delicious!  wanted more!  great preparation - arugula salad on side with 5 slices of salmon with a light sauce and a slide of jalapeno on each piece of salmon - wrap the salmon around some arugula - great!   2. Spicy Tuna no Dip - the spicy tuna mixture was just okay, but the rice cracker that it comes with is amazingly delicious, wouldn't order again for just that though - see the chazuke note  3. Hamachi Jalapeno - not my favorite.  not bad, but nothing special  4. Ika no Shiokara \"Home Made\" - the description is Marinated squid with fermented viscera - ugh.  only thing I did not like, but didn't think I would quite frankly based on the description, but my husband wanted to try it - he's like Mikey, he'll try anything.  It reminded me of a watery natto but not really.  Just gross for my tase.   5. Age dashi Nasu - eggplant, was amazing, my favorite dish but I love eggplant.  it was tender and flavored perfect - don't drink the sauce though, it's just for dipping and way too salty if you drink it  6. Age dashi Mochi - husbnad loved this, I thought it was good, but Nasu was better  7. Asari no Sakamushi - steamed clams in sake.  Good, but nothing special, next time I'll order more unique dishes  8. Ika Butter - had to try this considering this is what saved the day and got us there.  it was well done and flavorful, but too rich for our taste  9. Ankake Tofu - it's agedashi tofu with a spicy meat sauce instead of ponzu.  good, but we're pescatarian so wasn't a good fit for us - the tofu was well prepared though  10. Shiitake skewer - good, but nothing special  11. Ebi skewer - okay, noting great  12. Ume Chazuke w/Rice Cracker - served with the same type of rice as the Spicy Tuna no Dip, it was amazing!  we LOVED it!  13. Soft shelled crab appetizer special (deep fried) - lightly battered, lots of meat - great dish!  14. finished off the meal with Tofu Mousse - AMAZING!!!!  MUST TRY!!!  My husband also had a sake and loved it.  All in all, GREAT meal.  Wonderful find and will definitely be back next time we're in town and can afford to splurge.  Overall, the bill was just under $100 plus tip.  Not bad for 14 dishes plus a $18 sake order.  We were stuffed and it was all wonderful.  The staff was great, kept refilling our tea and even suggested this special roasted green tea instead of the regular one.  Can't go wrong with this place.  DEFINITELY RECOMMEND.",

So glad we did! Everything was delicious. We ordered tsukenya, pork belly, Mochi, sushi, jalapeno hamachi, and full bottle of nigori, an a beer and everything was less then 65.00. The service was excellent and it was authentic tasting. They gave us a complimentary potatoe tempura and I think that was my favorite dish but everything was five star. Thank you for the treat to my tummy! Highly recommended!",

If I was rating on food alone they would get 5 stars no problem. The atmosphere was like any typical Japanese restaurant here in the states. The reason I dropped them 2 stars is because of the service. We were seated right away because we were the 2nd group of people there when they opened for dinner at 5, this was our first time there so we needed a little time with the menu. Once we finally ordered our waitress brought out our food and that was the last we saw of her. We had to get up to get our own soy sauce and napkins and when we were done eating we sat there for about 10 minutes when someone came to clear the table, about 5 minutes later our waitress finally came by and brought our check and took another 5-10 minutes for her to come back and take my payment. I would probably try this place again but would probably go on a weekday for lunch if I do.",

However, I'm a huge fan of sushi and have had a few very authentic home-cooked Japanese meals, and based on what I know from these experiences, Kyara was a pleasant surprise!  It's so unfortunate that it has gotten a few poor reviews so early because they really almost kept us from checking it out.  The bottom line is, the food was great, the atmosphere was clean and comfortable, and the price-point is great!  Do yourself a favor a give Kyara a try.  Personally I can't wait to go back for more!",

As evidenced by previous reviews, I appreciate the offerings at Kyara, but they recently updated their menu and added some new, delicious items that contributed to an epic feast this past week. Notable items include the blue cheese potato salad, some super thin, fried chicken \"fingers,\" and the best bar snack bar none: gobo chips (fried burdock). I have never had these before, but if you know me, you know I adore fried okra, and fried burdock is the perfect stand in. Order me a couple of Japanese beers and a bowl of gobo chips, and I would be a very content barfly. We ended up ordering two orders. AND, (perhaps for a limited time) they have an Asahi lottery! Order one Asahi, and for your second, you get to draw a lottery ticket to determine the price. My price? FREE!! I highly suggest other restaurants consider this as a pricing mechanism. It was the highlight of my evening (after the gobo chips).",

I tried several skewer items, like the chicken skin, pork belly, ebi shrimp grilled, chicken gizzard, and chicken with onions. All delicious. I even had the buttter squid, and whole grilled squid. both were really excellent.  For dessert I tried the tofu mousse topped with strawberry sorbet, it was very good.  So if you haven't been here yet, you must really go. The place is a typical small spaced Japanese style restaurant, but has a comforting atmosphere. The prices range is from mid to upper range.  Even for the prices, you would still walk out satisfied.  But if you're a real hard core cheapo, this place is not for you.  This place is not a Jack in the Box or Taco Bell price range.  You gotta pay to play.... I payed and played and it was a very delicious experience.",

    "text": "The other day I was asked the million dollar question, \"What is your all-time favorite restaurant in Vegas?\" That's a pretty loaded question but my answer was, \"If we're talking Japanese, and especially during the lunch hour, KYARA HANDS DOWN.\"  How I haven't written a review for Kyara yet is beyond me. I'm here almost once every two weeks because lucky me, my office is only around the corner. Honestly, every chance I get to have lunch with a friend or a coworker, I instantly recommend we eat at Kyara and why not? Subway sandwich for $6 or Kyara meal for $10 that includes salad, soup, tempura, rice, and your main item? Seriously.. you get all those items with anything you order during lunch which is 11AM to 3PM I believe. They have several options to choose from - chicken teriyaki, sashimi, sushi, miso salmon, saba shio (mackeral), soba (buckwheat noodles), salmon don, spicy tuna don, etc.  For awhile I was only coming here for lunch because it was just such a good deal but one night the craving began again and I couldn't resist. And so happy I didn't. They have nightly specials (not sure what time it starts) but it included takowasa - my favorite!! Sadly though, the specialty items changes each month so I'll have to say farewell to my favorite dish and hope that my stomach and mouth will meet it again one sweet day.   Although they have full menu options, I think their specialty is Japanese tapas - it IS in the name after all. You can expect some tasty seared mackerel (aburi shime-saba is my FAVE), skewers, buttered squid, and much more.   For a quick review on the actual restaurant, the staff is friendly and the seating arrangement and set up plays well to the Japanese style - seats at a bar to observe the chefs, a room with 3 tables separated by a paper thin sliding door, and another area with a few small tables separated by a wall.   I haven't been disappointed by Kyara yet, and I don't expect to be anytime soon. If 80% of the customers are Japanese, then you know it has to say something about this place.",

    "text": "Kyara is a pretty awesome restaurant. Over the years of attending this place, there has been a consistently solid experience from a service, food, and ambiance standpoint. I would chose this spot over any other yakitori in the valley (still haven't tried Raku).   I personally like the location of Kyara. Sometimes, SMR can get overwhelming. That's why I like being away from the hustle and the bustle, occasionally.   The inside is small, but very intimate, with lots of Japanese aesthetics going from wall to wall. The open kitchen is immaculate, and due to great ventilation, you can hardly smell the meat wafting through the air.  The main reason to come here is for the yakitori, or \"meat on a stick\". But not really because they also have a wide variety of items that they skewer, such as, vegetables, poultry, seafood, etc. I think what separates this place from other similar locations is due to the smokiness of the cooked items. Kyara does a great job of imparting that flavor onto them. They use high quality and fresh items, and you can really tell while savoring the food. They also carry other items such as appetizers and entrees, which most of them are very good as well. I particularly like the takoyaki balls.  One of my favorite spots, I like about 90% of the things I've enjoyed here. I think the skewers are a good deal, but, I do hope they bring back their $1 skewer nights, that was the shiznit! This spot gets 4.5 stars from me.",

I ordered grilled squid there and it was so dry, had no taste what so ever, it wasn't fresh, and had a little strange funky taste when you take the first bite! That was the worst grilled squids I have ever tasted! Then the waitress recommended ground chicken fried rice among all the others type of rice. It had no salt or any taste at all. If you need to stay in business you might wanna step up your game. This was really a bad experience.",

    "text": "***Highlights***: ANOTHER GUILTY PLEASURE! But you have to like Japanese Japanese food. QUALITY, not Quantity. Love their late night hours.   Negatives: The only negative I can think of is that the food comes out in no particular order. But then again, this is really they only way they can maintain that authentic great quality of their food.   Price/Food: Food is amazing. As clean and traditional as you are really going to get in Las Vegas. Fresh Fish, Salted Skewers, and my favorite Ume Ochazuke. Remember this is Tapa style eating though. That bill will run up quickly. I have easily spend $65 on 2 people, not even including drinks.  Service/Ambiance: This place is really cozy and small. Great to catch up with friends, have a first date, or even to just eat alone. I love that I can sit down by myself, or sit at the sushi bar, and have a quality meal at 1am without feeling like a weirdo. NOT FOR KIDS! Not because they are not accommodating of children or anything.. but why spend $10 on your 2 year old. I love the sophisticated adult atmosphere, lets keep it that way.",

The servers were attentive and friendly.   Now the bummer- like a previous reviewer mentioned-we sat on the left side of the restaurant and was it uncomfortable. It was extremely stuffy and warm. I think they were aware of the stuffiness because they had a vertical fan set up to circulate the air. Not a good sign. We almost walked out but decided to stay. Despite the good food we will think long and hard about returning until they get their A/C fixed. Extreme bummer. We like this spot and it is only minutes from our house. Beware!",

I don't imagine tourists usually find their way here, but a local business owner recommended this place to us, and we were gratefully satisfied. We didn't have a reservation, so we did have to wait 20 minutes. I think that's reasonable for a Saturday night. The food and atmosphere reminded me of being at an Izakaya in Ikebukuro the last time I visited Tokyo. The prices were also reasonable.  We ordered: Spicy Tuna Roll, Salmon Sashimi Bowl, Shoyu Ramen, Cheese Tempura, Skewers of Asparagus/Bacon, Mochi/Bacon, Enoki/Bacon, Shitake Mushrooms, and Kara age. Every single thing ordered tasted wonderful, but our two favorites were the sashimi bowl and cheese tempura. The tempura was unconventional, but we were pleasantly surprised with how absolutely delicious the mozzarella, gouda, and havarti were.  The next time I'm in Vegas, I'm avoiding any \"asian\" food on the strip and coming directly here!",

Most recently I came here with my Love after yoga around 9pm. Luckily we got seats at the bar in front of the Sushi Chef. I love chefs!... Love watching chefs making sushi, rolling up rolls, cutting them into perfect pieces, putting the last garnish on the dish...all beautiful and fascinating...and I enjoyed immensely watching Chef at Kyara.  Service is always on point...suggesting different cuts of sushi available, specials of the day, etc. we enjoyed everything from Nigiri to Izakaya...but my favorites of the night were Baby Octopus Shio Kara Age and Soft Shell Shrimp. Kara Age was so crunchy and wonderfully flavorful, with just enough salt, and some brightness provided by the fresh squeezed lemon for a perfect amount of acid. For the shrimp, you just bite into it from head to tail...oishii!  I will certainly make a point to come back here at Kyara Japanese Tapas more often!",

Do not get wrong though, the sushi here is amazing. But unfortunately, my friend is allergic to fish so this trip is definitely meat focused. We also got the rib eye and the kurobuta sausage which the steak was under seasoned but they keep salt and ichimi (chili powder) on the table which is just fine for me.   I ordered the negi shio takoyaki special for myself and I have to say it was not a hit. It was overly salted and there was a lot of shio so it did make it pretty soggy. Back to regular takoyaki next time!!   Enjoy your time here, because I have every single time!",

We binged on their specials menu, which included salmon belly, uni, chutoro, and more. Definitely not the cheapest place, so everything added up quickly.

Nice Japanese ambiance. Friendly staff. Good selection on their menu.   Food- Udon had no taste. (not pictured)  Sashimi was good.  Miso salmon combination was good. Miso soup, salad & tempura was good. Sushi was good.  Tofu dessert was eh. I wouldn't order that again.  Iced green tea was good   We were over charged on our bill but it was quickly resolved.   Overall it was ok. I would eat here again if I was in the area and I wanted Japanese food but I wouldn't drive out of my way to go here.",

It is the perfect spot for after hour cravings for food, but want something a little bit better than your typical late night fast food restaurant. It is also a great place to have some drinks because of how much discounted alcohol there is to choose from on their happy hour menu. This menu has changed a couple of times, but as of April 2019, my favorite happy hour item is the ika butter (squid) and the cabbage rayu (Japanese chili oil). I definitely suggest trying both for some chewy savory bites alongside some fresh tasty greens. For dessert, I really enjoy the matcha waffle, even though it's full price. It's 2 delicious green tea matcha waffles with vanilla ice scream and a small scoop of sorbet, served with melted butter and honey. Delicious!  Another thing I really like about this place is that even though it's a popular tapas restaurant, there is almost never a long wait and that there's always a lot of parking.",

The staff is so so awesome and attentive, it seems they all work on a team to take care of the guests and it goes a long way.

We came during the hours of 11-3. I assume the business closes before dinner time to prep and reopens from 5-2am.   It may be because we came before there dinner closing around 3pm but after we were seated. It almost took 20 minutes before I had to ask a server if we could order. I usually don't do reviews about the staff but this particular visit was below satisfying. There were other guests seated next to us and already eating. The waiter at the time didn't acknowledge us until I brought up the point that we were waiting.   Regardless, the food was very good. The lunch special we had received was delicious.

All in all, it was meh. My favorite out of everything we got was the salmon and ikura bowl, which was almost $13. I wish it was a little bigger.   What bugged me a tad was the fact that almost everything came out in the beginning to the point where we barely had space on the table, and then the bowl came out at the very end. I wish they could have spaced it out better. Not gonna lie, I didn't pay for this meal but I remember seeing the bill and knowing that it wasn't worth what we had.",

Our typical order:  Yaki onigiri w/ume- The rice is grilled perfectly. Not too hard on the outside. And recently there have been a lot of ume in the rice ball which is a plus. A must try with the Yakitori.   Spicy tuna bowl- For $5 it's a decent price. Tuna is a little bland but nothing that soy sauce can't fix.   Negi chicken & tsukene skewer- both meats are grilled nicely. Not dry and negi chicken is marinated well.   Tori karaage- fluff, crisped and juicy. One of my favorite items   Agedashi tofu- Dashi broth was a little bland this time around. Bonito flakes would probably add a lil more flavor.   Service is always amazing here. Food comes out in a timely manner and servers always checks up on us.",

Highlight for me was the seared steak with garlic, ginger, wasabi and chives on the side.

Honestly guys you need a lesson in customer service , the non speaking servers were more accommodating . Wait time 30 minutes for 3 itty bitty sticks of food with no offer of water as I waited , just a small glass of wine all for freaking 15 bucks and I'm not full and I lost my appetite after that . Was planning to order more but changed my mind after that.Go to gyu kaku at Decatur or Yojie    Sahara .Better service and your belly will be full. Never coming back to this place . Ichiza maybe crowded but they have more choices hence people lining up even at 2:00 AM , as I said I've had had better than this restaurant can offer.  If you make the mistake of eating here , make sure you order about 5-6 or even 10 of their tapas to get your fill ,order at once so your 30 minute wait is worth it and you get out of there  within one hour , make sure your server listens to you and ask her /him to repeat what you ordered, from other reviews long wait time and getting the wrong orders and poor customer service are the main issues that will surely keep me away  . You have been warned .",

I don't think I'd order it again. The kushi mori comes with an assortment of different meats and veggies which I loved. My favorites were the chicken wing and pork belly. During cooking, the meats are based with a soy based sauce which I enjoyed thoroughly. The decor inside is casual but I wouldn't have a problem bringing a first date in here.

    "text": "As a Naked Fish customer of many years (since 2005...and with their rare \"member\" card), a die-hard loyal fan (I almost never try other places) and someone who has brought much business to them, including as personal and work caterers, I suppose I set my standards in customer service very high for this place and that might have set me up for the disappointment of this new restaurant.  I missed Wanda's energy, Miyuki's warmth...and the other staff (although I've noticed there are many new waitstaff now at NF - and I saw on NF staff now at this location).   And the reason it was missed is because the customer service was probably the worst I've experienced at any restaurant.  When I walked in, I waited for a minute - it was almost empty with a couple at the bar, some folks in a booth.  No one greeted me but then a waiter named Seoul (Sol?) came up and asked me what I wanted and I said, \"I'd like to sit down and eat please.\".  Then, I don't understand why confusion ensued.  He asked me three times if I was eating.  Finally, I said, \"I'd just like to eat - I can sit at the bar, thanks!\".   The waitstaff behind the counter did't acknowledge me - it was like I was invisible, what a great first visit!  I sit and wait for the menu and observe all other customers after me being greeted (by all staff there) and Sol takes my drink order.  I say, \"Water, no ice please....\".  He comes back with ice and water.  It's really not a big deal but I do note how NOT busy it is at that point...and how NOT very attentive he is being.  I order Cabbage no Zaki giri \"Taberu Rayu\", Spicy Tuna no Dip and Yamaimo Teppan.  And unlike another reviewer, didn't expect them to be so large (the Yamaimo Teppan was too much for me - mountain potato and ponzu on a hot plate).  I thought the cabbage was a large serving as well but this isn't a complaint.  Just to give others an idea about how large the servings are - it would have been better for two people.  The cabbage was awesome.  It's basically uncooked cabbage (raw) with a spicy oil on it that reminded me a little of the red oil they use in Sichuan, China.  I felt guilty ordering it though because it looks like I can make it at home.  But it was delicious...  The Spicy Tuna with the Rice crackers was tasty as well; I was happy with that.  The quality of the food is what I expected from Naked Fish.  The Yamaimo Teppan might not be for everyone although it was great to try; it's shredded potato baked with an egg, topped with bonito flakes, negi and nori.  If you're vegan and don't eat eggs, just fyi this has eggs in it (and fish) although it doesn't state on the menu.  It is also baked, not stir-fried it seems, which is the category it's under.  Some of it was a bit undercooked for my taste but overall, I think it just had an interesting flavor.  You should definitely try its uniqueness if you enjoy new tastes.  The food came quickly - except for the mountain potatoes.  I like that they have an open kitchen before you at the bar and you can see all that goes on - great idea.  Sol warmed up and checked on me one time (maybe because I was looking at the Sake menu - cha-ching!$ - at that moment).  Or maybe because he is genuinely a very good, caring and attentive waiter.  I'll believe the latter but give 2 stars for now.  I will go back one more time (they have an amazing menu!) and hopefully things will be different with customer service or they'll never have to seat me again.",

    "text": "**Summary**        - Flavor - Everything we had was either good or great. It was definitely a treat for the taste buds.        - Authentic - From the decor to the staff to the food, this is truly an authentic Japanese Izakaya place.        - Skewers - The sauce they use for the skewers is phenomenal. If you sit at the bar you can see them watch over the skewers the whole time. They take care to cook them perfectly.        - Value - You'll probably pay more here than getting a bento box elsewhere, but the portion size and flavor is well worth the price.        - Ichiza - I finally found a place closer to my house that's like Ichiza but better. Now, if only they had honey toast, I'd never have to go to Ichiza again. **Appetizers**        - $7.50 Yuzu Chili Salmon Salad - Five pieces of slightly seared salmon with arugula on the side. Salmon was fresh, texture was great, and the sauce gave it a little kick. (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/82YGtjc5KKikNiqBZ33qzw?select=IoNSnP5EADvdByH5lc0Okg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/82YG...</a>).        - $3.50 Garlic Potato - An interesting dish. Simple and good (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/82YGtjc5KKikNiqBZ33qzw?select=5SVXlhiZh5wVmGDmIkbIQw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/82YG...</a>).        - $3.80 Ikageso - Fried squid legs. If you like squid, it's pretty good. If you're expecting calamari, you might be disappointed.        - $5.50 Gyutan - 6 thin slices of beef tongue. It's ok, but a little pricy for the amount you get (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/82YGtjc5KKikNiqBZ33qzw?select=KTEPF6K1bZ2ettteQdBPug\">yelp.com/biz_photos/82YG...</a>). **Skewers**        - $1.90 Shoniku - Chicken thigh & leg skewer. The sauce they use for this was awesome. A must try (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/82YGtjc5KKikNiqBZ33qzw?select=NEgW0jgTSRdEKcLsyZaiaw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/82YG...</a>).        - $1.90 Negi Ma - Chicken with onion skewer. I preferred the shoniku (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/82YGtjc5KKikNiqBZ33qzw?select=XEcS2FIyQQh0N-oZ0iJQbw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/82YG...</a>).        - $2.20 Butabara - Pork belly. It has just the right amount of pork to fat ratio.        - $1.90 Sunagimo - Chicken Gizzard skewer. The gf said this was good. I don't really like gizzards. **Mini Meals**        - $5.00 Tori Meshi - Seasoned ground chicken on rice. Wasn't enough chicken. Nothing special.        - $6.50 Maguro Zuke Don - Marinated tuna and rice. The marinade on the pieces of tuna sashimi was fantastic. You get about 7 pieces. They give you too much rice though.        - $3.50 Mini Udon - A pretty decent sized portion for the price. The udon broth is better than most places (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/82YGtjc5KKikNiqBZ33qzw?select=RMx6mzBzs9eaE6ljMWJEPQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/82YG...</a>).        - $9.50 Koro Steak - A hefty portion of bite sized steak (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/82YGtjc5KKikNiqBZ33qzw?select=2y854wHXS3PICcqGLHVOcA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/82YG...</a>). **Misc**        - $5.00 Chawan Mushi - Steamed egg custard (with shrimp, scallops, squid, and clams). It's pretty hard to find in Vegas. The only other place in Vegas I've seen it is at Ichiza. The one they serve here is better and they put a lot more seafood in it (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/82YGtjc5KKikNiqBZ33qzw?select=WEMCUr8IfnhZjTl91hYI-Q\">yelp.com/biz_photos/82YG...</a>).        - $6.50 Yamaimo Teppan - I expected deep fried potatoes and got potato paste. Needless to say, it wasn't good and pretty salty.        - $6.50 Chocolate Fondant - Chocolate Souffle with a size of ice cream. Takes 15 minutes to make and is well worth it (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/82YGtjc5KKikNiqBZ33qzw?select=nmJILyCSEzADl7xQzVmmEA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/82YG...</a>). **Recommendations**        - I'd recommend this place for anyone looking to treat themselves to some delicious non-sushi Japanese.",

    "text": "This place has great service, food, interior, and atmosphere. I plan to come back again. Next time, I won't bring my mom nor brother-in-law for they are annoyingly rude, picky, racist, and inconsiderate. The food is absolutely delicious. Do NOT say things like \"it's like ayce kbbq but it's more pricey\". It's unjustly to compare this restaurant to another style of cooking and style that another country does. I came here to try the food and appreciate it as I savor it. I didn't come here to spend two hours listening to my guests be assholes and even making fun of Japanese customs and language while being INSIDE a japanese restaurant. I'm ashamed to know those two and I deeply apologize to Kyara for my guests' ill mannerisms. My brother-in-law was so eager to do \"a trick\" for my birthday with the use of the chopstick-rest and mini cups of syrup . I kept trying to stop him because I knew it would make a mess. He went for it anyway, spilled the ounce of melted butter (it was for the Matcha Waffle) which leaked through the tight space between our two tables and onto the floor. He didn't even want to notify an employee or clean up after himself. Then, he wanted to just messily dump a bunch of napkins on the floor and pass it off as \"good enough\". Sometimes it's not a restaurant's fault if there's a mess that didn't get cleaned up; sometimes it's the fault of an immature, irresponsible, asshole of a customer. The next few people that would have sat at our table would have judged the place unjustly no matter how great of a job they have done. I apologize to yelpers for this explanation, but I don't want Kyara to have lower ratings just because my brother-in-law caused a chain of bad impressions amongst the succeeding patrons of our table. Anyways, we had a lot of food since my mom didn't bother to try anything other than garlic shrimp and a california roll since she happens to be racist against other asian countries' food other than her home country and fake chinese food (the kind tweaked to american palates).  We ordered: -Tuna Carpaccio: that garlic chip and sauce adds such a nice touch to the flavor -Kobe Beef Tataki: comes with a mild dip and a slightly spicy dip -Tuna Poke Salad: tastes great. the seaweed salad seemed to taste a bit peanutty to me though -Shishito Peppers: my brother-in-law enjoyed it -Mochi Bacon: mmm squishy rice cake -Buta-Bara (pork belly): juicy -Ton Toro (pork cheeks): hardened a bit because i was focused on the beef, but still pretty good -Koro Koro Steak (diced cut rib eye steak): juicy. comes with bean sprouts on a sizzling plate -Soft Shell Crab: i believe we ended up ordering 8 -Agedashi Tofu: nice softness/firmness -Salmon Yaki Onigiri: N/A, took it home and ate the next day. -Mentaiko Yaki Onigiri: same response as above. -Takoyaki: i like it almost as much as Jinya Ramen's -Negi Takoyaki: comes with a dipping sauce -California Roll: N/A, i didn't try it -Sashimi 6 Kinds (tuna, salmon, yellowtail, halibut, albacore, ikura): heaven -Smelt Egg Nigiri: generous on the eggs -Garlic Shrimp: comes with caramelized onions. yum -Maccha/Matcha Waffle: comes with vanilla ice cream, a sorbet, cup of honey syrup, cup of melted butter. satisfying. harmonious when drizzled-to-taste Even though my mom and brother-in-law kept ruining my mood and appetite, I still found enjoyment in the food although I usually wouldn't have if I had eaten anything else and THAT'S how I'm able to say that Kyara has really good chefs.",

    "text": "When I think of eating in Las Vegas, I think of the gluttonous buffet. And while fun, I can honestly say that I would rather eat at Olive Garden. Needless to say, my visits to Vegas do not typically have memorable meals attached to them.  Tonight, I decided to follow Yelpers advice and try Kyara and I couldn't have been more pleased with my experience. The service and atmosphere are quite good, but the reason to go there is for the tapas - all of them gently prepared and REALLY good.  I first had an assortment of Kushiyaki (skewered veggies and meats) - they were perfectly cooked and flavorful (without sauces to mask their individuality). My favorite were the mushrooms (and I am not a huge shroom fan) and of course the shishito peppers (I could eat 100 of those).  I also highly recommend the spicy tuna dip. This is basically a really large scoop of very delicious spicy tuna served with fresh rice cakes. You pile the tuna on the cake and enjoy - perfect contrast between textures and temperature.  While they have a good menu of sake and spirits, I did not drink tonight. My total bill was under $30.  Kyara is worth the visit!",

The tapas are delicious and well-priced. A dinner for 2, we got full without eating any rice, is around $40-$50. Such a steal. We got the green tea soju drink and they made it stronger as we requested. I would recommend eating some dishes with rice because it did get a little salty by itself like the koro koro steak.",

I personally enjoy watching my food being cooked so my friend and I opted to sit there.  The menu is pretty simple, but I think that is a plus as they did everything well.  The prices were not bad either, but they can add up depending on how much you order.  I was pleasantly surprised with their chawanmushi, it was really flavorful, and more importantly wasn't overdone, it still jiggled just a wee bit.  It also had plenty of seafood in it which was very tasty.  Their fried chicken was also really really good, it was probably my favorite dish that we had that night.  Overall, food was tasty and promptly served, service was good, and getting there is easy.",

Anyway, foods are very good and we are very pleased. But one thing we weren't happy is choices.. They didn't have many choices.. its not like ichiza.

I ordered the pork katsu combination with a rapponggi roll and mom ordered the chirashi combination lunch. I was finished with my lunch by the time my mom's came out. My roll never showed up. When I asked about it the waitress lied and said the sushi chef was half way finished making it. 10 minutes later, we asked again and the waitress and waiter started mumbling and disappeared.  Neither one came back to our table to even refill our drinks. When I asked the sushi chef about my order,  he said he was just starting to make it. I told him to not make it and to make sure the roll was off my check. The waiter finally brought the check but he was so rude that he just threw the check on the table. He then kept telling me that our TO GO order was ready but wouldn't hand it to me. Basically, the wait for food and GOOD SERVICE took longer than eating because #1 we never got GOOD SERVICE and the food was just eh.  The original KYARA Group were so sweet and great! Either train these newbie servers better or hire better people.",

My friend and I visited Kyara as we usually treat each other to lunch and today were here treat, she got off easy! I ordered the spicy salmon bowl, the rice was perfect and the salmon was fresh, this also came with another bowl of rice, soup, salad and tempura. My friend ordered the combination nigiri that came with the same accompaniments, she enjoyed hers as well and commented how fresh the fish was. My only gripe is they don't have brewed iced tea :( but that won't stop me from coming back, I need to try the rest of the menu.",

    "text": "Expectations can be a blessing, or a curse. Sometimes it helps to whet the appetite and build excitement before an epic experience. Other times it can drain the flavor of the moment as reality falls short of an unreasonable ideal.  For Kyara, I had started with Yelp (of course) and noted the many wonderful reviews and recommendations. I saw that this was frequently visited by the Yelp Elite and they had collectively given it high marks. This evening fell short of that mark.  The atmosphere was wonderful. Clean and efficiently appointed with special extras like the small bamboo spice containers on the table. Service was also quite good. Attentive, but not invasive, willing to make suggestions and help guide our choices.  But ultimately, it simply must come down to the food, the singular reason for spending your hard earned money to have someone else prepare your meal. We had three experienced diners on a journey through the menu. We tried several items and found some stand-out selections that delighted our senses. But alas, we also had several items that fell short of gastronomic bliss.  Some of the stand out dishes included the Kaisen Chawanmushi (seafood custard) which was creamy and beautifully infused with shrimp flavor, and the Yuzu Chili Salmon with equal balance of acidity, spice and lovely salmon flavor. The dishes that had challenges included the Kawa (chicken skin) and Butabara (tongue) which both lacked flavor and left me wanting.  The overall experience to price ratio was decent, with several dishes and hearty man sized appetites we spent about $70 per person. I could try it again, but I would be selective on the dishes I tried.",

    "text": "Favorite restaurant in Las Vegas! That's because I can't get enough of Japanese food!  Been here over a dozen times and absolutely love this place. Its a Japanese izakaya style restaurant which means a Japanese bar with food. They serve tapas which are small appetizer portions of food to share amongst one another. They have a great selection of sake and shochu (Japanese Vodka). The staff can be very helpful in finding the perfect one for you! Food is delectable! Service is wonderful when they aren't crazy busy. Would suggest a reservation just in case they get a sudden rush out of the blue.   Favorites: #1 Asahi Draft (amber) mixed with Asahi Kuronama (black) bottled beer from Japan  #2 Maybe a bottle of sake like their Shimizu No Mai or Dewazakura Oka for one to two. Dassai, Shimeharitsu Jun, or Yoshinogawa for groups of 3 or more. If you really want to have fun try their Japanese Whiskey-Yamazaki 12yr or 18 yr.  #3 Hamachi Jalapeno (Sliced raw yellowtail with jalapeno, garlic paste, sriracha, and yuzu ponzu).  #4 Maguro Carpaccio (Sliced raw tuna with homemade garlic chips, garlic mayo, and garlic ponzu).  #5 Wafu Caesars Salad (Japanese style Caesars salad)  #6 Kushi Mori (7 different types of skewers) Includes: the all time fav Butabara kushi (pork belly).  #7 Ika Geso Age (deep fried squid legs) They run out quickly of this one :(  #8 Nasu Dengaku (Deep fried eggplant with spicy miso meat sauce)   #10 Pork Kimchee (Stir fried pork with kimchee) All time fav!  #11 Chicken Garlic Ponzu (Stir fried Chicken with garlic ponzu sauce)  #12 Ika Butter (Stir fried squid rings in butter)  #11 Gyutan Stew (Tender Beef Tongue with gravy sauce and veggies)  #13Tori Meshi (Ground chicken with veggies on top of a rice bowl)  #14 Maguro Zuke Don (Marinated tuna usually raw on top of a sushi rice bowl)  #15 Chocolate Fondant with Vanilla Ice Cream and/or Green Tea Waffle with    Vanilla Ice Cream, honey, and butter.  *P.S. Do not forget to order a bowl or two of their white rice! Sorry no brown. They use an ultra premium rice that I can not resist even on a diet!   Writing all of this makes me want to go right now! I can still make it before they close and it is now 1 am. :)",

That is a lie. Kyara is still good, just not get-42-demerits-from-the-Health-District-and-still-go-there good like Ichiza. I say that because I wasn't exploding full like I am after Ichiza. Besides, Ichiza's menu is way bigger. Also Ichiza is like a warm hang out with people sitting near you and everybody is drinking pitchers of beer. I've been to Ichiza for many memorable life events. Kyara is a place to have a tasteful date: sit up straight, shyly look up at each other and talk quietly. Enough about this.  Eat these: Hirame no Oba Age: The all knowing deep-fryer united cheese and fish. Submit yourself and make sure no one can see the spit dripping from your mouth as you wait for the dish to cool. Koro Koro Steak: One of the more portion-satisfying dishes, you will enjoy every bite. Ensure you eat everything that comes with it. The flavor combination is great. The meat is finely cooked. Kawa Kushi: chicken skin skewer melts in your mouth. Chicken skin is my weakness. Butabara: pork belly. It was charred and delicious. Enoki Bacon: The stringy mushrooms aren't much for dignified eating, but this was an umami delight, very savory. Gyutan: Beef tongue, thinly cut and cooked well. The meat is tender, drippy and not disturbed by seasonings. Maccha Affogato: who cares if it's plain vanilla ice cream from the plastic tub? They smother it in hot green tea syrup and cold green tea syrup. So good. Green Tea Waffle: Green tea waffles-wow! But what makes this a killer combo is honey. This dish could battle the honey toast at Ichiza.  I would eat a big lunch then come here for dinner and drinks. They have their own beer here. Which is cool if you want a unique check-in on your untappd.",

In my opinion, this izakaya tops other similar establishments with their combination of quality food, friendly service, authenticity and affordability. Love the casual-yet-cozy ambience of this place with the smell of meats perpetually cooking on the grill. Great meals for lunch, date night or late night.   I have not seen a better presentation of a sashimi lunch special in any other restaurant, especially at such a low price point. I come here often and crave the same things on their menu. Ika butter, tontoro pork (cheeks) skewers, beef intestine skewers, cheese tempura, pork fried rice, mochi bacon, green tea waffle and the list goes on. It's one of the best collections of Japanese comfort food under one roof. They often have specials such as salmon belly and fresh uni. They also serve rolls made popular by their sister restaurant, Naked Fish. With rolls like the GTR, it's enough to turn a nigiri/sashimi purist like me into a convert.",

    "text": "If there is anything I love most, it would be Japanese food and so I am very picky with the quality of food and service. Kyara has been open for a while and is very popular as a local spot in Vegas. I have been here a few times just to try out their service and quality of food from an unbiased perspective. Unfortunately, every time I come here, I have the same outlook. It's just \"OK\" and nothing more.  Service: I think the most important thing in the food and beverage industry is service. You can have the worst food on the menu, but if service is amazing and you get treated well, it can counterbalance that (to some degree, of course). I would rate their service 3/5. I have been here a few times and I get the same service. I usually would have to get someone's attention a few times before I get a refill or whatever it may be. I never get the same consistency and it gets frustrating at times.  Quality/Price of Food: The quality of food varies. They have great fish overall, you can tell that the majority of their items are fresh. They have an array of cold and hot dishes, typical of what you would see in a Japanese tapas spot. However, I do not agree with the price. It is a bit expensive for Japanese tapas. There are other Japanese tapas I have been to in Las Vegas, New York, Miami and Los Angeles where it has been cheaper. The last time I went, I had barely ordered dishes, and the price I paid was way more than I thought it would be.  Ambiance: The restaurant and the decor itself is very clean and cute. The location is great, as well! For an off the strip restaurant, I think they have a great location right off of Jones and 215! I do like how the restaurant is kept clean and simple.  Overall, this is not my first choice of Japanese tapas and there is nothing that really stands out on the menu.",

Check in on yelp for an extra something. You could get a cocktail item or ice cream as your dessert item.  Never had a problem with their service. It was just hard to understand my server so I just nodded along and that's how I found out my check-in item was ice cream :b.

We were given a Japanese slaw while waiting for our food.  We pretty much ordered 2 of each item on the menu: sasami, tomato caprese, ika butter, ham katsu, tori kara-age, koro koro steak, beef tataki, chawanmushi, enoki bacon, mochi bacon, asparagus bacon, butabara kushi, hamachi jalapeno, grilled veggies, aburi shime saba (mackerel), skewers (chicken, pork and wings), green tea waffle, and matcha affogato.  The price wasn't bad.  We ended up paying $180 for 3 people and we ordered a lot of food.  The girls I was with gave up so I had to clean up the mess we started.  My favorites were anything with bacon, koro koro steak (so tender), green tea waffle combined with the matcha affogato.  Delish!!!   The service was excellent. I find no reason not to come back!",

We paid 10.95 each and got the 5 piece nigiri with 2 piece shrimp and mixed veg tempura with salad and rice. I think that's a nice deal for lunch. Hubby got the pork katsu and liked it.   Dinner-both times we had a LONG wait. I mean about an hour. I don't think it is that great to have an hour wait. One time we wanted their fresh tofu and they only make it on the hour, that was annoying because we already waited, how long do you want us to wait for some fresh tofu? So we did not get it. It is a 2 hour plus meal. Very slow paced, so plan to spend some time here.   Blue cheese potato salad-I think the original would be better. Quite a strong blue cheese taste. I was happy with all the skewers I tried.   I did not like the yaki onigiri- a huge ball of burnt rice with very little salmon. Not what I pictured in my mind.   I plan on coming back for lunch specials, but I would not go out of my way for dinner unless I have a lot of time on my hands and was not that hungry and could wait.",

    "text": "I'm new to the term \"Izakaya\" which originated from sake shops that allowed customers to drink in their establishment.  There's an open kitchen with bar seating all around and I believe 4 sets of semi-private tables.  The menu consists of mostly cooked foods, with limited sushi items on the last page and separate added menus of monthly specials, most popular dishes (both with pictures) and a sushi roll menu.  What I noticed first was the seasonings on the table (see picture.)  This was my first Kyara lesson.  In addition to the standard salt, pepper and soy sauce, there was an additional shaker of spice (ichimi - ground chili pepper) and two special containers one filled with what our server could only describe as seasoning she likes on the skewers (sansho - which I googled to find out that it is a plant in which you pulverize the berries to make this pepper)  and the other was seven different spices (shichimi - which sansho is one of the main peppers, orange peel, black and white sesame seeds, hemp seed, ground ginger, and seaweed) which was incredibly yummy on everything.    When I went to my trusty yelp app I noticed there was a check in offer for a free appetizer.  Come to find out they've changed it to a free dessert - however I'm not a \"sweets\" person and asked if I could have a miso soup instead and they accommodated.  Yay!  Unfortunately, it was very mildly flavored and  not as hot as I would have preferred.  Boo!  I ordered the shiitake mushrooms $1.50 each, shishito peppers $1.50 each (picture is of two orders) pork belly $2.50, chicken gizzard $2.50, deep fried squid $3.80, octopus, halibut and albacore nigiri $4 each.  The mushrooms, peppers and pork belly were delicious.  All cooked perfectly.  The pork belly had just enough fat to balance the flavor and was juicy.  The gizzard was ok and the squid was a little on the dry side.  Although the squid came with lemon, and wasn't greasy, it needed something.  I was thinking of maybe a sauce to dip in but they didn't really have anything.  The sushi was ok.  Not the best quality but I should have expected this as sushi is not what they're known for.  So many other things I wanted to try so I'll definitely come back.  (Especially to try the gyutan stew - beef tongue $12.)  Service was excellent and Soichiro was delightful and extremely helpful and patient with all my questions.",

    "text": "I have eaten here several times. The food here is good, but the service is something that needs work on EXTREMELY BAD. Since we got sat it took them about 15mins to get us water, we were never greeted by our server. I had to stand up and ask for us to get served water and to get our order taken. The person that took our orders wasn't that nice either, a bit rude if you asked me.  Since being here for almost 30mins I have seen 3 groups of people come In after us, get their food and leave. While we haven't gotten our food or got checked up on. It was busy but nothing crazy. Even if they were backed up they should have touched the table and made us aware of it. Finally after 35mins later, the food arrived BUT unfortunately my order was wrong. Probably due to the fact that the person who took our order didn't write it down. The first guy that dropped of the food didn't even say sorry to me for messing up my order, shame.  Another thing was that on yelp there is a advertisement for 1 free special app, we asked about it. But they told us it was only for dinner. If it's for dinner only, then I think it should state that on the advertisement.   The ENTIRE time we we're there not once did we get checked up on. It was the worse experience I ever had. All in all, I love the food here, it's what I come back for. Service on the other hand really disappoints, it's sad for a place like this. My suggestion servers/hosts Please pay attention to your customers more. I'm super good on leaving tips too, but not this time. No service no tip..sorry. I sure hope the next time I come there's better service.",

Quality of sushi is excellent and you can request belly cut.  Almost everyone who works here are Japanese, though service can be confusing at time so if you're doing English stick with English, don't mix Japanese and English together even if you have a native speaker lol  Definitely recommend to anyone who wants good authentic sushi and Japanese dishes.  By far beats all the so call high end Japanese restaurants on the strip that modernize sushi so much it comes out and tastes like a project while burning your wallet.  Save your money at the card table instead!",

This place is horrible, don't know how it's so highly rated. Maybe dinner is totally different but this lunch was a waste of time and money.  First of all ordered glass of red wine, few minutes later came back with white. Told them ordered red, looked at me and went to change it. 5 minutes later came back and said they were out, only $13 glass available. So ordered it. Tasted like box wine, except boxed wine is actually better. Long story short, order 2 lunch boxes and a side of GRILLED chicken. One box came first, then 5 minutes later chicken came  except was not grilled, Fried to a crisp!! Totally inedible. Then after everything was finished, the mackerel for the other box came.  Unbelievably bad. Maybe dinner is different , but won't risk it, Soooooo many other good/great places to go. Negative stars.... Don't trust the pictures. Also I think maybe everyone was too busy in the kitchen talking that food was all burned to a crisp.",

    "text": "This place was recommended to me by a random stranger at a bar. Once I looked up the Yelp reviews, I went in that same night. What can I say, patience is for losers.  HH specials from 10-1AM. Location decor is nice, the cozy nooks allow for some privacy for dining with friends or a date. Service is attentive without constantly stopping by the table, which again lends itself to a more private meal.  POTATO SALAD WITH BLEU CHEESE: Creamy texture, cheesy taste, what's not to love about this? Simple but tasty. Ate it too fast to get a pic. GOBO CHIPS: Not clear what these are made out of, but they're crunchy and light and have a good flavor, seasoned lightly with furikake. TEKKA ROLL: Pretty standard, would stick to sashimi here. FRIED GARLIC POTATOES: More potatoes? Yes, they're tasty. Garlic taste isn't too overwhelming but it paired well with the sauce from the next dish... BABY SQUID STIR FRIED IN GARLIC: Hands down the best dish. I'd eat a whole trough of this on my hands and knees, it's that good. Garlicky sauce, tender squid babies, and green onion. So, so good. ABURI SABA: Can't go wrong with mackerel, didn't care for the acidic dipping sauce it was paired with. SALMON DON: bowl of sushi rice topped with salmon sashimi. Salmon was good, portion of rice was a bit much. TOMATO BACON: if you love BLTs, you'll love this. Not particularly unique but love the taste, I get this often. TEMPURA CHEESE: Now THIS surprised me. Tempura mozzarella, havarti, and brie. The portion of fig jam could have been more generous, it was barely a single bite. Dish wa still good. SALMON SASHIMI: Quality of fish in the don was so good we just asked for an additional order of sashimi. For $11, it's a steal. So fresh and delicious, just dip slightly in soy sauce and enjoy.  Don't forget to use your Yelp check-in offer for a free appetizer. Beers and wines are half off during HH, and the house Cab is actually pretty good quality. Menu is extensive, but most everything was really good.",

With that said, this is only a review of their lunch but I am eagerly awaiting my next visit to try their other menu items.   Nice and easy location to get to right off the interstate which was a bonus. It can get super busy inside so squeezing a quick lunch within an hour's time. The place was so busy we had to sit at the sushi bar to eat curry. Not a bad thing, but I felt so guilty taking up precious sushi bar space!! lol  The downside of eating at the sushi bar was that I got to see how they made the curry:  1. They take a bowl from the freezer.  2. They take the top off and open said bowl.  3. Place in microwave.  4. Plate up rice while curry is being nuked. 5. Dump curry from bowl onto rice.   The upside of watching the cooking process, you hope that it's homemade curry they cooked and froze in advance to make it easier for the customers to enjoy. :) It certainly was just as tasty as the curry I make at home. Not the worst, but also not the best. Just a solid choice for curry.  You can add chicken Katsu for a small price more and it's a well rounded meal. Overall, good place for lunch and a definite add to the list of lunching options. :)",

This is definitely a hidden gem (which after word gets out may no longer be) that I have been going to more and more lately. Currently $2 happy hour beers to go with a variety of delicious small plates that you can share with everyone.   Some of my favorite dishes include: Hamachi jalapeno Age dashi Nasu (eggplant) Sauteed clams with sake Ika Butter (squid) pork kimchee koro koro steak gyutan skewers (beef tongue) chocolate fondant (basically a warm chocolate cake)  This is definitely one of my new favorite places to bring my friends that are visiting. So far, everyone has enjoyed this place and we will definitely be back again to try some of the other dishes.",

We usually go somewhere new every date but never have the urge to return anywhere. Until here, anyway. The price was great considered how much we ate. We ordered some sashimi, a side of rice, some cold soba (I love soba!), some sort of ramen with pork and vegetable that was on the specials list for the month which was actually quite tasty, some garlic squid, and the deja vu roll. It was enough to fill us up and we eat A LOT. The service was fine. The server was very informative and confident when speaking to us. We had to ask for the rice more than 2 times, but other than that the service was good. We assumed that maybe the rice was cooking when we had asked, but the servers did not want to let us know for whatever reason. I reccomend this place. It is small, but really good.",

I enjoyed the mini udon, the koro koro steak, the kushi mori, and the agedashi tofu.   The tofu used for the agedashi tofu wasn't from anywhere special, but it was good. The koro koro steak was very tender. The kushi mori was okay. Mini udon was flavorful and the broth was pretty yummy.   Service is ok. The server expects you to move things aside to make room for the next dish. Water is always filled.   Sit at the counter and you'll be able to see their open kitchen and their workers at work, cooking your delicious meal.   I would come back again if it were closer to me. If I'm in the area, I'll definitely be in.",

It's nice to have a sushi-ish restaurant in the SW that serves quality fish and a has skilled kitchen. Service was not too stellar, as our waiter disappeared for a long time.

I sat at the bar, and I ordered 4 items from kushi (chicken with onion, a wing, enoki wrapped with bacon, and the best the tsukune (chicken w/ pork).  I ordered without sauce, just salt, but I have heard the sauces are great as well with the skewers.  From the specials I got a spinach salad with beef.  I could totally go for that right now.  Beef was very tender.  And finally I had a mini bowl of udon soup.  Perfect size for someone who wants to eat other things with the soup as opposed to ordering a big bowl.  The prices stand out here, they are not high.  Definitely cheaper than the other places in Vegas.  It's a great spot to introduce many different tastes to the palate.  Domo arigato!!",

My daughter and I got there at 12:32pm for a lunch date with my hubby/her daddy.  We got there before my hubby, so we can get a table and order, so the food will be delivered before/when my hubby arrives(since Hubby's lunch break is only an hour). The guy(Hispanic, tall, I guess is also the person in charge cuz I asked to speak to the manager, and he said he was in charge) at the front asked how many people, I replied, \"Three, and we can sit anywhere.\" He said, \"We're cleaning up a table right now, so it'll only be a few mins.\"  We still haven't gotten seated when my hubby arrived at 12:45pm. We still patiently waited until 1:07pm. Then, I approached someone and told them, \"We've waited for over 30 mins when we were told it'll only be a few mins to get seated.\"  Then the guy who told me that walked by, and I asked him, \"Why did you tell me it'll only be a few minutes when it's been 35 mins, and we still haven't gotten seated? That's very inconsiderate and unprofessional of you. If you had told me it'll be that much longer, we would've maybe gone somewhere else.\"  I then asked to speak to a manager, and he replied, \"He's not here right now, and I'm in charge.\" Then I said, \"Wow, you had us waiting this long, and we didn't even get an apology? Instead, you're going to try to make excuses(he said he didn't want to seat us at the bar because we had my 3yo daughter).\"  I added, \"Then why did you tell me you guys were cleaning up a table for us.\" We just decided to leave.  My hubby ended up missing lunch! Thanks for ruining our lunch date, IDIOTS!!!   My friends and I ate here for the first time 2 weeks ago, and they lacked service.  But I wanted to give them another try since they're literally 2 mins away from my house. NEVER AGAIN!!!!! (Wish SOHO was still open for lunch:( )",

That's important to know because not many restaurants are baby-friendly. The booths are spacious and rooms are divided so Max (my baby) can't bother that many people. I especially like checking off the items I want a-la San Francisco Dim Sum style. I tend to over order because of my appetite so it helps to see things written down and realize all that food can't fit into this body.   The stars of the night are the two sashimi dishes in the appetizers section and the teriyaki sauce. I can pour that sauce on anything and it'd elevate the dish to the next level. Similar to a well-aged balsamic vinegar. So make sure you order the meat skewers with sauce and vegetable salted with sauce on the side.    Great food, great service great ambiance. WIN WIN WIN!",

Personal favorites were the yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno, albacore sashimi, shiitake mushroom kabobs, pork belly kabobs, and shishito peppers, but we liked everything we ordered (the list is so long, I don't remember everything.)  My wife enjoyed her drink (but I think I liked it more than she did) - it was ginger ale with Hibiki (Japanese whiskey.)  Left both of our heads spinning a little, but not to worry - we just hung out and ordered more food until we sobered up :-)  Finished up with the chocolate fondant, which was pretty much a lava cake - VERY good.  A few drinks, over 15 plates to share, dessert, and out the door full and completely satisfied for around $100.  Can't wait to come back and try more of the menu, and get another Hibiki drink!",

    "text": "Finally popped my Kyara Izakaya cherry, and.....  IT WAS AMAZING! A friend of mine had been telling me about this place for a few months now and last night I finally went.   I made reservations at about 7pm for an 8pm dinner for three and noted a birthday celebration. We showed up at around 7:50pm behind another group of three, who were promptly asked if they had reservations (no) and they were advised there were no tables available. Right after they were seated at the bar, we were greeted and seated at our table. - Had no issues -  **TIP - if you check into yelp or facebook, they are offering a free specialty drink**  The food was really good, small portions but that is the style. The Kobe Beef Tataki and the Green Tea Waffles are a must try. All in all I loved this place. The service I received was great and the food was soooo good. If you're interested in reading about the food we tried, I'll have that at the bottom. :]  --------------------  The menu wasn't too extensive and I saw a lot of dishes that I hadn't expected such as skewered tomatoes... interesting.   We ended up ordering some sake, a Tiger Roll, Garlic Chicken Ponzu, Soft Shell Crab, Kobe Beef Tataki, skewered Chicken Gizzard, Beef Tongue Nabe, Gyu-tan and Hamachi Kama. The first two dishes to come out were the Tiger Roll and the plate of Kobe Beef Takaki.  The Tiger Roll (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=XpMJhr84RXu_qvJIW4mGmQ&userid=q50PWB-QR1YCHa60kagzgw\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>) was ordered by my bf so I don't know what exactly was in it, but it was pretty good.   The Kobe Beef Tataki (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=6MLmC1nRp-04fWHjhypiEw&userid=q50PWB-QR1YCHa60kagzgw\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>) was my order and WE LOVED IT. If you're not scared of eating meat a little raw I would definitely suggest trying this. It is sooo tender. It also comes with two different dipping sauces - a normal ponzu and a spicy, garlic ponzu. the tray also included some garlic and wasabi as well. - This was easily one of my favorite dishes. We actually ended up ordering a 2nd plate -  Then a whole mess of dishes came out, so I don't remember the order exactly. We had the Garlic Chicken Ponzu (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=3c1fINvReL4dU9Qtfy-saA&userid=q50PWB-QR1YCHa60kagzgw\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>), Soft Shell Crab (no photo, we ate it too fast), Beeg Tongue Nabe (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=RcLCN3Cc_QVoVwZkmctiaA&userid=q50PWB-QR1YCHa60kagzgw\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>), Gyu-tan or broiled beef tongue (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=YTocyZFFxqoUxnnucmbT6A&userid=q50PWB-QR1YCHa60kagzgw\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>), and the Hamachi Kama (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photosselect=HC23Jrwpr6VzB66wvfN_Ig&userid=q50PWB-QR1YCHa60kagzgw\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>).   The Garlic Chicken Ponzu was my bf's favorite. We also ordered another one of those. The Soft Shell crab was like most other soft shell crabs I've had, nothing super special. The Gyu-Tan is broiled beef tongue. It wasn't very flavorful, it was ok. I think Ichiza's skewered Beef Tongue is better. The Beef Tongue Nabe, however, was a delight. It wasn't what I expected at all. Our waitress described it to me as Beef Tongue Hot Pot with veggies. The broth was flavorful but light and the best part was the vegatables had soaked up just enough of each flavor. The potatoes were cooked perfectly, not too raw and hard and not so over cooked it just fell apart.   One of the last dishes we ordered was the Asari Sakamushi (steamed clams in sake). It was a nice light dish to finish off dinner. Again, ate it too fast to remember to snap a picture. OOPS.  LASTLY, they brought out the Green Tea Waffles with Happy Birthday written on the plate in Green Tea Syrup. (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=uBK2VG0oRqfTbwM_UH7EGQ&userid=q50PWB-QR1YCHa60kagzgw\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>) IT WAS SOOOO GOOD. If you enjoy Green Tea, you will love this dessert!",

Featuring an extensive menu of Japanese classics arranged under headings such as grilled, steamed, and fried plus a handful of daily specials as Chef Komada watched over a team of four in the open kitchen it was with an eye toward variety that we placed our order and with a complimentary cocktail to begin nearly every one of our nine items proved excellent, particularly considering a total bill inclusive of tip less than $30 per person.  Starting first with cold selections and then proceeding through those grilled and hot it was with impeccable skill that traditional options like robatayaki, grilled squid, and chawanmushi shined but far more interesting and thus more impressive were items trending toward esoteric, both the hot and cold mountain potato dishes absolute show stoppers in terms of texture and flavor while tempura selections proved innovative and light.  Moving on to dessert, a decision left in my hands, a selection two sweets arrived and while the tofu mousse was admittedly quite light the general lack of flavor proved rather underwhelming in its own regard and all the more so next to a pair of crispy yet supple matcha spiked waffles topped with a hefty scoop of vanilla ice cream and sidecars of liquid butter and honey, the end effect every bit as delicious as the Honey Toast at Ichiza or Serenade but with a slight bitter undertone adding a touch of intrigue, an upgrade on a classic that seems to typify much of the restaurant's cuisine and all the more reason to come back soon.",

The servers are friendly and comes around frequently to fill your water or make sure you're doing okay.   It's a great place to order a little bit of everything and share! Other than the yakitori (skewered chicken) orders, the portions are pretty big. There's a lot to choose from too. But try to order it all in the beginning so you won't have to wait too long.  The korokoro steak is a must order! It's delicious~ I ordered it for myself thinking it was going to be small since it's a tapas place but I was not able to finish it by myself.   They have a good selection on drinks as well!   There's plenty of parking in front of the restaurant!",

    "text": "Wanting to meet the GF for a mid week date night this was the place to try after searching Yelp for something new to try that would split the journey equally for us to meet.  Kyara is a small and intimate dining establishment.  For mid week it was busy but when a table came available it was quickly cleaned and we were seated.  Having never really tried tapas of any kind, we began to check of numerous items from the menu to hand to the waiter.  Chicken skewers, sushi, salads, soups we tried a little of everything.  I should have been taking notes, but was distracted with conversations and watching what everyone else was doing.  The highlight of the night was when soup was presented to us.  As the waiter kindly explained despite a small language barrier, I made out something that sound like \"Don't let smell scare you.\"  I immediately gave it a sniff but only noticed a sort of earthy aroma emanating from it.  I dived in and began noticing the different textures.  Located within was something that I thought might have been some kind of pickled green bean.  The chunks of meat were a mystery.  Both the GF and I had fun guessing what it might be.  When the waiter returned I made an inquiry  as to what the green thing was as well as the meat.  We were then informed that it was gelatinous seaweed and pork intestines.  GF stopped eating and I went on to finish it. It was different and not bad at all.  It is easy to get lost with checking boxes on the items that look good.  Before we knew it we had an army of small plates and bowls maneuvering all about our table.  Fun place and I would absolutely try it again.",

We finally got our drinks about 12 minutes after being seated. Server was not attentive at all. They were pretty busy but there was very little interaction with him. Our food arrived and we didn't have silverware on our table so we had to ask and wait for them.  Please work on service here. You have a great following and product but lack on the service side",

I went with a few friends/co-workers of mine, and I got to taste a bunch of goodness!   One of the most memorable items was the \"Koro Koro steak.\" The sauce, the tenderness of the meat, the grated radish/garlic on top, with the soybean sprouts to add some texture! PERFECT, in my opinion. The next favorite was the \"Jidori Tori Kara\" tender & juicy local chicken with a wonderful garlic ponzu sauce! I loved the citrus-y taste it had and the chicken, you could just tell was of high quality.  We also had the \"Maguro Carpaccio\" and a few of the skewers. EVERYTHING was good. Also, we finished with the chocolate fondue dessert, awesome with the ice cream.   Between the 4 of us the bill was under $50, which is definitely affordable!  I really wanted to try the deep friend mochi, and the agedashi eggplant, but they ran out of eggplant, and my party wasn't as interested in the mochi dish. -sigh- there's always next time!  I will return, and I'm sure I will probably outspend my first visit since I was being polite and not being the pig I usually am! I can't wait.  PS  they are open late! even better!",

    "text": "ITADAKIMASU!  Ever have that craving for some good yakitori, or a simple bowl of udon noodles unmolested by fancy, modern twists?  Kyara has that, and more.  With it's genuine yakitori grill and simple preparations, their Japanese fare is my favorite in town thus far.  Not only are you transported to a small restaurant in Japan--and I'm not talking Tokyo, but some other well populated city with those restaurant alleys--but the flavors are spot on and bountiful.  The moment you walk in you're greeted by happy servers and chefs.  A simple, clean bar to sit at is the main display, while smaller, private seating areas are available.  I opt for counters every single time.  Why?  Because I take joy in watching chefs prepare food.  From the hand-beaten pots to the fine knife work on vegetables and seafood, it's a show in of itself, and you get to eat it!  I ordered almost everything, from tempura to beef tongue.  We of course order a few things off the small grill, as well as some udon, miso, and the like.  The grilled food is perfect, as you can get it either just salted or sauced.  Both are melt-in-your-mouth yummy, and hot off the grill.  The tempura is crispy, yet light, and what I love about this place is the chopped up radish topped with ginger that they serve with it.  I throw that mountain in to my tempura sauce and have at it.    Despite their yummy grilled foods, the one thing that blew my mind was their base broth for their udon noodles and the miso soup.  I don't know what type of dashi or bonito they use, but the first sip and slurp of the udon made my eyes close and my mouth drool with a wet, udon-y smile.  I was whisked back to the days on the beach eating udon in the early morning, or those after bar dinners at 3am.  Needless to say I tried to stop by the following night for another bowl or two of udon, but they close on Mondays.  Darnit.  Fellow yelpers, foodies, and friends--you must stop in and have a bite here.  It's a great hidden gem in Vegas, and one that, in some ways, I wish we could keep secret. I don't want to share their yummy goodies with anyone else except all of you.  Quietly make your way down to S. Jones & 215.  I'll be the fat chick in the corner slurping on udon, eating some meat on a stick, and chopstick-ing some sashimi.  Gochisosama!",

Why don't you prep for this rather than run out of stuff.  Ran out of chawan mushi.  Had to reserve one of the last two tofu mousses.  About half of the things we wanted weren't available.  The Yelp check-in deal is no longer valid. They now offer one of three free drinks for a check-in on any mobile platform (Facebook, Foursquare, etc.). I got the tea version. It was horrible. Tasted like grape cough syrup. No wonder they give it away for free.  Ok now that I've got the bad out of the way.  The chicken skin skewer was very good.  Heck the table next to us ordered like 15 of them.  I imagine that'd be delicious if I didn't think too closely about the fact that I'm eating 15 skewers of chicken skin.  The eggplant and meat sauce was also good, but maybe a bit pricy for what it was (like mabo tofu).  While they might have some good items it was overall a poor experience.  The pork belly was also pretty decent.  They had the aji two ways which was so so.  When it comes two ways it comes as sashimi and nigiri.  They had a nice presentation where the fish skeleton was skewered to look like it was swimming, but they didn't fry it up for us.  It's nice that they have hamachi kama there (I really like the collar bone), but it was a bit overcooked so a bit disappointed.  With all the food around Vegas I think I'm going to explore elsewhere next time.",

Curry rice is a bit boring and small portion, plate and sauce are big but not a whole lot of meat inside. I'd skip ordering curry rice here if given the choice. But only $7 can't have everything I guess.   The tonkatsu is always a winner and we always get a side of it to go with our already filling lunch set w soup, salad, entree and tempura. Hope they never change it.",

We ordered the rib eye steak, fish tacos, takoyaki, shishito pepper skewers, unazaki(I think that's the name) and a pitcher of Sapporo.  The rib eye, per my boyfriend, was amazing! Seasoned very well and tender. I like that they already cut it up in bite size pieces. And it came in decent amount on a hot staub. I overheard the people next to us mention how good it smelled which was True! I ended up dipping my shishito peppers in the marinate. The shishito peppers were grilled to perfection, came in threes which was a really good price! The fish tacos was really good. The \"shell\" was a deep fried circular wonton with raw fish with a few micro herbs and sauce. Each bite was very fresh. The unazaki came on their \"eel month\" menu. Basically cooked unagi with pickled sweet cucumbers and cooked seaweed. I think all three of those came together very well. And lastly, the takoyaki. Very delicious. I liked that it wasn't steaming hot when it came so I can actually enjoy it without burning my entire mouth. Also came on their happy menu along with the Sapporo! Cheers!  Came out to around $50 dollars, which was about the same price as we would've paid for AYCE sushi(which is what we were deciding against) and we left with happy full stomach!",

The matcha-flavored desserts don't taste at all like matcha.  The service is not too pleasant.

Nothing fancy but it's nice and cozy.  Food: Delicious! We started with garlic edamame and gyoza's. The edamame was very good but the gyozas could have been a little more flavorful. We then moved to the salmon and mackerel combo entrees. Each combo served with salad, soup and rice. Both dishes were very good and we especially enjoyed the salad - ginger dressing was spot on. We had also ordered the California roll, which sadly never made it to our table. Not sure if the server forgot to put in the order or what... anyways, we didn't really care (even though we were charged) because everything else was so great. It was likely just a small human error- no biggie!",

The Teppan ramen had zero broth and way less flavor than usual this time around. Boooooooo.  A word of advice on the mentaiko yaki onigiri- as soon as you get it, open up in half so that the inside doesn't cook through from the internal heat. The mentaiko is good raw, but when it gets cooked it is NOT good at all. I made the mistake of waiting 10 minutes to eat it and wish I had managed to keep it raw inside otherwise there's no point in getting it.  Service is stellar as always.",

It is so much fun to try 3-5 different items everytime I come here and I never leave disappointed.  My all time favorites here are the Hamachi Kama, Koro Koro steak, and Age Dashi Tofu. The desserts are great too.   It also makes the restaurant feel super authentic when the customers all around you are speaking in Japanese, I think that even all the waiters here are fluent as they take orders in Japanese as well!   I used to go to Ichiza whenever I wanted that Izakaya adventure but Kyara beats that with a way better menu design and more often than not, better tasting food (just missing that honey toast).  You just HAVE to try this place! Also adding some menu pics since I didn't see any pics on yelp of their current menu - 07/2017",

Takoyaki 6 pcs- my go-to app. I like that they use aonori plus the outside is crispy and inside is not mushy.  Black Pork belly skewer with salt- this was the favorite of the night. Perfectly seasoned and not overcooked, very succulent, didn't need anything else.  Koro Koro steak- got this since it had so many good reviews; normally I'd get my usual salmon ikuradon. Now I don't  if what we had last night was how it was supposed to taste but that thing was super biiiiitter. Maybe they cooked it too long cause the sauce near the edges took on a black charred color. I ate it with rice but I dipped some of the meat in soy sauce to rid the bitterness..  Teppan ramen- bf's choice. DON'T GET THIS. It was completely devoid of any flavor whatsoever. It just tasted like Ramen noodles sauteed in butter and they didn't bother to season with any salt OR pepper. Chow mein from panda has more flavor lol I had to sprinkle pepper on myself but there was no salt on the table, only soy sauce. There were more noodles than meat and veggies too.  Service is always good, they keep the refills coming before you're out.",

Only problem i have is with the service, seems to be a little haphazard.  Last time I went, I ordered a lunch combo, and they brought the rice, soup, salad, and tempura first, then the entree (pork katsu) was supposed to be brought out immediately after that.  However, the entree never came until I called the waitress over and asked what happened.  Seems they forgot or had the order messed up, so I had to take home the katsu since I had finished  eating everything else.  Sensed confusion in the whole operation, like waitress takes your order, then it is brought out by someone else, but seems Kyara needs better coordination if they are going to do something like that.  Cheesecake Factory and California Pizza kitchen has that kind of service down to a \"T\", so Kyara has a ways to go to meet that kind of standard.",

We asked one of the guy with white turtle neck for our check. First check he brought to us was a wrong one and he seemed little drunk at the same time. We told the guy that it wasn't our check. We didn't hear any sorry from the  guy but he told us we were very nice of us to tell him that it wasn't out check. While he was talking, I was able to tell that he was a bit drunk. Then he went back to the counter and brought us a second check. Second check was a wrong one too. Then, I quickly asked for the manager since I thought they were playing with us. We asked our server for the manager and she pointed out to the white turtle neck guy. I told him this isn't funny anymore. It took about a min to bring our real check and told us he wasn't tried to be funny. I do understand people make mistakes but when you were having fun with other guests and drink while on the job then bring out two wrong checks is not right. I was very disappointed at Kyara and this will be my last time visiting this place.",

I'd imagine it's close what you'd experience in Japan.   Lunch options are a tad on the higher priced side but you get an extremely large amount of food which doesn't really match the atmosphere with everything being so small. Bento boxes come with a chicken, fish or beef and you get rice, side salad, tempura shrimp and veggies, and miso soup. Far too much food for lunch. The food is decent and my teriyaki salmon was very good. Other favorites are the salad with a ginger dressing and the tempura.   So now we get to the service. For starters it's extremely slow. It takes far too long to get your order in and then you wait a long time to get your food. They also don't come around once they've given you your food so you're always thirsty waiting to get anyone's attention. Everything comes out first except your protein so your rice gets cold before you get the rest of your meal. Weird. This has happened twice to our group so we'll need to take it off the list for lunch options as we don't always have 2 hours for leisurely breaks. Maybe dinner is more organized?",

Went here with 4 other people at 10pm last night, and getting from just getting water, all the way to getting our checks just took FOREVER. The foods still decent, however, they take forever with everything. They barely come back to check on us, and when they do, they literally check on one table, then just walk away! They took 10 minutes just to get us water, 25 minutes for the food, and our last 25 minutes there was from trying to get the bill. Took them forever to come to us for us to ask for the bill, and about 5 minutes for them to swipe our cards. We got there at 10pm, and we left at 11:30... we were literally the only table in the area for our first 30 minutes there... I don't even know if I want to come back unless I have absolutely NOTHING planned for the rest of the day.",

My wife and I really enjoyed the atmosphere, the service  is very friendly and fast. The servers are what make everything so much better , our server who I believe was the manger , Brian , was very assertive and made our night with his personality. Not only was he good to us , we saw how he treated the other tables of people around us and we were in shock of how good he was , too good to be True! I would hire him at my restaurant any day! We will for sure be back to Kyara ! Thank you so much for the great service",

We came in and ordered a bunch of skewers, chawan mushi, a shrimp appetizer, corn on a stick and an ikura bowl.  The skewers always come out amazing, I personally like the ones that are seasoned with salt (you can choose when you write it down on the paper). My favorite so far is the pork cheek. The texture is just amazing, it's like a melt in your mouth goodness but still has a slightly chewy texture to it. Unfortunately they forgot to make a handful of the skewers that we ordered but they fixed it right away.   The corn was on their specials menu - it's like grilled corn on the cob brushed with a slightly sweet teriyaki like sauce. My wife was a huge fan, I personally don't care for corn on the cob (mainly because I'm too lazy to eat it and it gets stuck in my teeth) but I'm glad she enjoyed it.   The chawan mushi was typical, the small fried shrimps appetizer is something we always order. They fry them in butter until crispy - the shells turn out so crispy that you could just eat it whole with no problem. Ikura bowl was nothing special (except that it IS one of the best things in the world in its own natural state) but the portion was generous.   By the way, the free appetizer with Yelp check in is actually only good for an ice cream dessert. Or at least this was what I was told the last two visits. You may want to ask about it first should you choose to use it.",

They play Japanese music, the seatings are mostly small tables or at the bar. This place is not very big, but it is very personable. It is also very calm environment, not super loud or bar like, although their drinks are good.   Service: the waiters are most likely from Japan, their English is not super good, but they do understand enough to order food. I also kind of like it because it seems more authentic.  Food and drink: their sake is good, and I'm a huge fan of Japanese beer so really enjoyed the Kirin draft. As for food, very authentic and very delicious. I saw how they cooked their skewers, and again it brought me back to Japan. Their sushi was good, the skewers were tasty, the oysters were amazing and the price for everything was not bad. I also have to mention that the food comes out slowly, but it is great when you are socializing with friends and the food comes out individually.   I really enjoyed this restaurant, I believe that it is a great late night spot for food and drinks.",

    "text": "Sorely disappointed in this place. I had this place bookmarked ever since moving to Vegas nine months ago. We were in the area and my friend recommended we go here so I figured I could unbookmark it from my list. We ordered the salmon tartar, agedashi tofu, sausage, chicken tender skewers, chicken and green onion skewers, enoki mushrooms wrapped in bacon skewers, pork belly skewers, and grilled mackerel--all of which were very disappointing. The skewers all tasted of char. I could taste the grill and that was it. The chicken meat was dry. The kitchen used the same teriyaki sauce for all the skewers and was quite stingy with it. I couldn't even moisten my dry meat with anything besides force feeding myself and washing it down with green tea. The grilled mackerel was tough and dry as well.   Be sure to double check your receipt when they bring you the check. It's easy to lose track of what you ordered since small plates can easily add up. A neat trick is to count the number of plates you ordered instead of remembering the names of the plates. I'm glad I did because they tried to charge us for alcohol that we didn't order. After correcting the mistake, we asked the lady to split the bill down the middle with two cards. She couldn't even do that! Our server overcharged me! So that was her tip. She either really wanted the extra couple bucks or was just having a rough night. Sorry, but I won't be returning.",

I had plenty of time, though, to smell how delicious it could have been.  We called on a Saturday night (tonight) at 9:12 pm and made a reservation for 9 people. We were informed that the table would be available approximately 20 minutes from the time of our call.  We arrived to the lobby at about 9:40 pm and were told that our table wasn't ready; it would be another 15 minutes.  The party of 2 finished eating and just needed to settle their bill so their table could be set up as part of our table. After waiting another 35 minutes, we asked how much longer it would be for our table to be ready. She told us it should just be 10 more minutes as the customers were finished eating and they were just waiting for them to leave.  At about 10:30 pm, she asked us if we wanted to get seated in the first table and wait for the second table to be available. I partly wanted to wait because I already invested so much of my time and the food smelled SO GOOD, but I also couldn't believe the lack of customer service. Please don't offer reservations if you are unable to honor them.",

Had bacon wrapped mochi perfectly executed, toasted till nutty, perfectly rendered a gooey. Fatty pork cheeks were great. Ankimo \"torchon\" was super fresh, o-toro was good quality, rice is lacking in texture but good. Super gracious staff, menu keeps getting bigger and better. Great neighborhood restaurant.",

    "text": "I came here with a friend for a quick lunch. Their lunch hours are 11-330pm? anyways, its really easy to find - its right next to sambalatte.  They have an arrangement for lunch specials. They have individual sides or u can get boxes where it comes with rice, miso soup, tempura, and whatever main dish u ordered.   My friend had gotten a sushi roll. This wasn't on the lunch special menu. They don't have all the rolls they would have on the dinner menu, only a portion. The price they offer for the roll during lunch time however is the same as the dinner price.   The miso salmon is really good! They glaze the salmon with light miso sauce and the portion of the fish is good too. You can ask for brown rice instead of the white rice- no extra charge.  The only reason I gave four stars instead of five is because they didn't have curry katsu. They had Japanese curry rice as an option and katsu as an option- but not together. I thought it was odd that a Japanese place didn't have the combination of both. I'm not sure if the dinner has it or not, but the lunch menu sure didn't. And if you wanted it, you have to order BOTH dishes so you would end up getting charged basically double. Booooo",

Which is more than I can say about that other place that starts with an \"I.\"  In-N-Out?  Island Style?  Anyways.  Point is, it's rare to visit a place multiple times and discover a great dish during each visit.  So what are the hits at Kyara?  Curry rice with Chicken Katsu (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/82YGtjc5KKikNiqBZ33qzw?select=87dospmcjfGzayBR-YnztQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/82YG...</a>): This is one of the lunch specials, and makes me wish I worked nearby!  The curry has a great balance of heat and flavor, while the katsu is lightly breaded and not burnt at all.  Highly recommended if you're in the area.  Garlic Chicken Ponzu (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/82YGtjc5KKikNiqBZ33qzw?select=80gTRDZO6f20tLoWDYQY7w\">yelp.com/biz_photos/82YG...</a>): At $5.80, this is a great portion for a tapas place if you ask me.  Garlic is delicious, ponzu is delicious, put them together and it's double delicious.  Aburi Shime Saba: Seared Mackerel with yuzu ponzu sauce.  Mmm mmm good!  You get a good serving of mackerel with this dish.  It's also very lightly seared.  Like maybe the chef prepared the dish within view of a flame; that lightly seared.  Tsukune: Ground Chicken and pork skewer.  Tasty and freshly prepared.  A bit crisp on the outside with a hot and juicy interior.    Service here has been consistently good, along with food quality.  If you're headed to Kyara, be sure to invite me along!",

Over a long period of time coming here, I have never received less than outstanding service across the board. I'm always greeted very kindly and thanked. Service with a smile at all times. They are knowledgeable about all of their items including spirits.   Then of course there is the fantastic food. I'm vegetarian and their options to meet my needs are never disappointing. I definitely recommend the gobo chips, agadashi tofu, garlic butter edamame, and shitake mushrooms. Everything is fairly priced.   They have a happy hour that starts at 10 pm as well, so I always have a good serving of hot sake for 3 bucks a pop.  Thanks Kyara!",

    "text": "Came back for dinner. Lunch is a far better value, but there are a lot of great things to be said for their izakaya-style dishes!   From living in Japan, I think the way you are supposed to order at an izakaya is little by little, and ordering things as snacks to accompany drinking. However, I did not follow this method and ordered tapas-style. We ordered a ton and got super stuffed.  I loved the skewers--I got a bunch of different kinds. The vegetable kushi skewers were actually the best, which I was super surprised about. Get the okra, asparagus and the onion. Onion was best!   We tried the miso cheese, which was kind of weird. It is basically miso infused cream cheese. My boyfriend loved it though.  Chawanmushi was okay, a little much since it arrived at the end of the meal. It was very salty.  My boyfriend ordered the fish of the day...all I remember about it was it didn't taste very good and it was pretty darn expensive for the size (around $15, I'd say)?  Staff was a little inattentive, which I was sad about. They seated all of the people who came in in the front section (I came around 5:30 p.m., which is super early). I would have rather sat in the side area with a view of the sushi bar, so I will ask for that next time.",

    "text": "Came here for lunch the other day and was fully satisfied with my meal. For about $10 I ordered the spicy  tuna rice bowl, and for the combination it came with a bowl of miso soup, a salad, and a variety of tempura. Everything was pretty much on point-- the soup was flavorful and had a balanced saltiness, the salad came with a sweet ginger dressing on the side which was a nice touch, and the tempura was fresh and crispy. I especially liked that there was kabocha (Japanese pumpkin) tempura along with sweet potato and asparagus. The spicy tuna itself was pretty good, however there was a bit of sweetness to it which was a bit strange for my taste. My dad ordered sashimi in the combination meal and he said that the fish was fresh.  Overall I was pleasantly full, and it was a great deal for the price. Service was good as well, as someone was always there to refill my cup of tea. I definitely want to come back again for lunch and for dinner as well!  -------------------------------------------- Update: Came back here for dinner for the first time and it was even better! Everything we ordered was delicious in its own way. Two dishes that stood out to me were the  agedashi nasu (like agetashi tofu but with eggplant), and the Roppongi sushi roll. The Roppongi roll was kind of a surprise because it was described as \"spicy tuna roll with tuna on top\" on the menu but had an amazing sauce-- I think were was sesame and probably mayo. The fish was fresh and the service was as good as the other times-- plates were cleared up quickly and all the servers were friendly.",

    "text": "I love this place. I give it 4.5 stars. I used to go to Ichiza back in the days, but it just went downhill and I was waiting for a decent Japanese tapas place. I totally forgot about this place and I'm glad I went again. We ordered tuna tataki. It wasn't great nor was it bad. Can I pass on this the next time I come here? I sure can. The garlic squid was an OMG moment for me.  The squid was melt in your mouth and the garlic sauce was delicious. The asparagus was good with the squid. Perfect combo. It was so good, I had to order another one.  Word of advise, save the garlic sauce so you can dip it with other stuff. Hehe we also ordered the asparagus Pork. It looked great, but I didn't try it, but at least I took a picture of it. The Cajun chicken was okay. It didn't distinguish from any other popcorn chicken I have had in other places. I thought it lacked a bit of seasoning, but what makes it Cajun is the sauce. The sauce wasn't a deal breaker either. We also ordered the soft shell crab. It's soft shell crab that you can get in most Japanese restaurants. It was good fried crab. Mmm. Jalapeno poppers were delicious. Not spicy at all and it has bacon bits on it. Again, great but not awesome. We ordered a variety of skewers, which didn't disappoint. We ordered gizzard, Pork cheek, Pork brisket, and chicken wings. Least favorite was the chicken wings on the skewer. Not much meat on it.  We also ordered the takoyaki. It's wheat flour ball with octopus. Nom nom. Be careful when you bite into it, it's piping hot and you really dont want to explain to other people that your mouth got burned by giant scorching balls. Lol we also ordered the ikura and salmon bowl and mini udon. Both were good and the udon broth was good after eating all that food. It makes your tummy nice and warm. But wait!! What better way to top an evening off? Ice cream!!! So we ordered the maccha waffle with vanilla ice cream. I'm not sure where I made room for this, but it was delicious. It reminded me of honey toast except honey toast on crack! Lol. Highly recommend to get this. I can't wait to come back and what's better, they are open late.",

    "text": "Kyara is one of the more pleasant finds I've come across in Las Vegas. From the outside it's an unassuming location that happens to be right next door to a 24 hour smoothie shop. But step inside and once that door closes you feel like your in another world. Las Vegas just kinda fades away.   I tried Kyara for lunch and was seated where I could see right into the kitchen. There were tables located in semi-hidden areas along the North wall and also a larger table in a small room along the East wall. Service was 5 star + from start to finish. I had questions, they answered everything I asked and even helped me with my chopstick technique or serious lack thereof.   But this is a restaurant review and the food here shines. I had trouble deciding what to get so I ended up with a lunch combination plate. I ordered a spicy salmon bowl and it came with tempura, salad, miso soup and rice. While I enjoyed everything presented the tempura was a mixed experience with 2 pieces I was ho-hum with (still good though) and 3 pieces that just flat out wowed me. The sizes were smaller than expected but as this is a Japanese Tapas establishment I had adjusted my portion size expectations before coming in the door. The salmon bowl with a little bit of additional soy sauce was wonderful. The salad was very good, and the miso soup was excellent.   When one looks at the quality, the presentation, the decor, the service, and how good everything tastes giving Kyara 5 stars right off the bat for a first visit is very easy. It is ultra rare for me to be smiling all the way through my lunch and be excited by everything on my plate but Kyara did that for me. When the only negative thing I could find was that they needed to take a duster to one of the air vents (and it wasn't that bad), I knew I had found something special. And the fact that you can sit and look right into the kitchen and see your food being prepared, it eliminates any doubts about quality of the food or the skills of the preparers.  I will be back, and I will bring others. If you're reading Kyara's reviews and are debating on giving it a try, you need to get off the fence and go try it.",

    "text": "Despite the proximity to my house, this was my first visit to Kyara. It definitely took way too long. Finally after mentioning I wanted to try the place every time I drove past this place with my fella, he decided to surprise me with a visit here for Valentine's dinner last night.   We arrived around 8pm and were seated very quickly. Glad my fella made a reservation, as they had our table ready and waiting for us when we arrived at the busy restaurant. The server was quick to approach us for our drink orders and was extremely attentive and diligent throughout the meal. I have to give extra kudos for the impeccable service at Kyara. We were never left wanting for anything. Our drinks were always full, our stream of food arrived promptly and well spaced out and all the servers were incredibly friendly and helpful with recommendations.  We ordered a large variety of options to get a sampling of as many things as we could. My favorites for the evening were the jalapeno salmon, garlic potatoes (despite burning the entire inside of my mouth), bacon wrapped enoki mushrooms, tempura cheese with fig jam and the yuzu dessert, which was amazing. Everything else was pretty good as well, but it's hard not to compare the place to my other two favorite izakaya restaurants in town Raku and Ichiza. I loved a lot of the dishes, but the skewers and other cooked food didn't blow me away as much as Raku or Ichiza, unfortunately. Don't get me wrong, the food was definitely solid and I will definitely be back to try a smattering of other options. I just wish the char on many of the grilled and skewered meats was a little more present. The sasami with wasabi was overly dry and flavorless, so I don't think I'd order that again.  The fish, starch and dessert selections were amazing though. Very tasty indeed.  The fantastic service was topped off by the presentation of chocolates and a pink rose to commemorate the Valentine's holiday. Very nice touch.  I have heard very good things about their lunch offerings and look forward to hopefully trying the place out for lunch some time soon. Definitely a great option in my neighborhood. So glad they have a place close to home to satiate my cravings. I'll be back.",

Lots of good flavors there but I didn't like tomatoes in my fried rice.   Also tried the Lisa Lisa roll...that was my favorite. Good mix of textures and flavors.   Unfortunately the menu is mostly in Japanese making it difficult to understand .",

He said no and could not explain why.  Then, Angelica came and fixed everything. She apologized for our wait, took my suggestion about the stool, and brought us a comped orange juice for are trouble. She was great and changed our whole experience :)",

Very rude! I watch them discourage people from waiting daily. Calling a 5 to 10 min wait a 20-25 min wait and holding ghost reservations. The only reason I come back is because of the chef. In my opinion they would be much more successful with a new front staff.",

My roommate and I stayed as we had already built our appetites. I had a beef and spinach salad. It was delicious, and it was the first time I had a dish that incorporated cold beef. The garlic potatoes were crisp and hot but could have had more flavor. For tapas, this is a nice place. I would recommend the skewers :)   The negative aspects were that they expected reservations and the seating was cramped. Also, my roommate would have like to be warned that the shrimp would come with their heads and skins on. (they didn't offer a refund for that appetizer, even though we didn't touch it)",

I was thinking about grabbing some lunch when I glanced over and say their sign that read, \"Now serving Lunch.\" I was intrigued so I googled them and their lunch deal look great so I decided to stop in and try them out.   I was quite pleasantly surprised by what my entire experience. Immediately upon walking in I was greeted and sat at the sushi bar. The server quickly got my drink order and looked over the menu. There was a nice selection all for around $9 to $12. Nice! I settled on the 6 pieces of sashimi lunch. Nothing too exciting, but again it's lunch.   What you get: 6 pieces of sashimi (salmon, tuna, yellowtail) Miso Soup Salad Bowl of Rice  Shrimp Tempura  You should have seen the amount of food they piled in front of me. I was almost overwhelmed by it all. What a deal! I also totally enjoyed it all too. The atmosphere is clean and fresh, the service is great, and the food was pretty good. I would definitely go back and am very curious about their dinner now.",

    "text": "This is my hidden gem find during the last LV trip.  It was our first night arriving in LV for the CES show. All the airport travel hassles made us really hungry and ready for great food.  Armed with a sheet of to-try resto during this trip, we drove to the middle of almost no-where hoping to find that next hidden gem during this trip. And we hit a jackpot!  L O C A T I O N: on a quiet strip mall, not much light at night; a bit out of the way. not a good business location.  S E R V I C E: Excellent service, polite. Our waiter was a young Japanese guy from Central Japan, he was very patient explainig in details each of the item we asked him and never rushed us to order.  The place opened about a year ago.  For a place that's at least the same par as Raku, this was place noticeable not as busy as Raku; most likely due to their location. This place has a nicer decor and sits more comfortable than Raku; but Raku has that typical authentic Tokyo's gritty izakaya feel which some people may prefer more. These two places have both their pluses and minuses.  We'd probably sit next to the bar next time to watch the hustle & bustle inside their open kitchen.  Their bar seating area had a nice ambiance light   This place has quite reasonable prices and small collection, but interesting selections of Premium Sake, Shochu and Japanese \"whisky\". This place also carries Genshu - undiluted sake with relatively high (18-20%) alcohol content.  At the recommendation of our waiter, we opted for the Ozeki Osakaya Chobei (Junmai Daiginjo) instead. 300ml/$38.  Ika Geso-Age - one of the best, tastiest fried squid legs. The batter was thin and extremely tasty.  The aroma came out nicely when sprinkled with a dash of lemon.  This dish somehow always ended up on my side of the table. $3.80  Gobo chips - fried burdock root.  Not commonly found in many Izakayas. $2.80  Hamachi Jalapeno - This sliced yellowtail with Yuzu ponzu was certainly one of the winner of the night! $9.50  Ika Uni Ae - $4.50. This is a dish for unilover (\"yoo\" nee lover? is that a new word?) because the Uni is mashed and mixed with soft slices of Ika, creating an intensified aroma of uni. Probably not for univirgin.  Saki Ika tempura - deep fried dried squid. $3.80. This was OK only for me. It reminds me of those dried squid snacks you find in Taiwan, or other Asian snack shops.  SKEWERS sunagimo - chicken gizzard $1.80 nasu - eggplant $1.50 Shoniku - chicken thigh $1.80 sasami wasabi - chicken breast  $2.30 Tsukune+Egg - Ground Chicken and Pork $2.50 (+$1 with cage-free egg)  We ended our meal with the obligatory Mini Udon which we ordered in double-size ($3.80/ea).  The broth was savory, light, yet tasty with the right balance of salt.    By this time we're full, but couldn't resist the Dessert. Our waiter recommended the Tofu Mousse (came with 3 scoops of Strawberry sorbet).  We ordered his recommendation and added the Green Tea Waffle ($5.25). His Tofu Mousse recommendation was definitely the winner - light and refreshing.   The green tea waffle is just a bit too dense/heavy after all the meals.  We left satisfied. Great service, great food; our stomach left happy as well and our feet are ready for the grueling walk at the ultra,mega CES show floor.  We shall be back!",

The bill tends to add up as you're tempted by low prices and a variety of tasty treats so be sure to take advantage of any specials or deals they have going on.   Aburi Shime Saba Seared Mackerel with yuzu ponzu sauce   - Absolutely amazing the natural flavors of the mackerel that's been lightly touched by a blue flame then served with a side of tangy ponzu sauce. Absolutely amazing   Chicken Garlic Ponzu Stir fried chicken with Garlic Ponzu  - When Anthony M recommended this i wondered why. Who goes to a Japanese place and gets stir-fried chicken?? Holy Moley  this breast is divinity served with am amazing sauce. The chicken breast is still juicy and tender while the dry rub and garlic ponzu sauce just kick it up a few notches. NICE!   Salmon Ikura Don Salmon and Ikura (Salmon raw) on bowl of rice  - Our waitress put this order in when all i wanted was a salmon rice ball. In the end i just decided to eat it anyway seeing as i was a bit hungry that night. Not exactly what i ordered but hell i didnt complain. Only thing i can point out is based on personal preference, would have been nice of the salmon slices were chilled a bit more.  SKEWERS!!  Negi Ma Chicken Meat with Onion - Think it's hunks of breast meat but man when you bite into that grilled onion wooo makes it all worth it.  Sasami Chicken breast - Very nice, nicely seasoned with a bit of salt but grilled to perfection. Still juicy on the inside and perfectly tender.   Kawa Chicken skin  - Good thing Tony T was also with us to point out a few techniques and methods. According to him the chicken skins had the fat rendered out so it's just all skin. If you're going to order this be sure to get it sauced (Shio). Sauced makes it so much better than salted.  Tsukune Ground Chicken and pork (Tare/Shio)  - Ground meat reformed on a stick! Good stuff couldnt identify what kind of herb was used to add additional flavor but sure glad they did it.   Anything Wrapped in Bacon - The asparagus wrapped in bacon was good. Very high quality bacon they use and they sure know how to grill it. Perfectly cooked and nice and crispy. The bacon wrapped Enoki mushrooms on the other hand was perfect.   Shishito Japanese pepper  - If you havent had these yet give them a try. Wonderful flavor and Jin C's favorite. Who else orders 6 skewers?!",

Ordered the stir fried squid, garlic potatoes, cheesy potatoe dish, pork intestine stew, chicken skin skewers, chicken theigh skewers, and enoki bacon.  The skewers were nothing special, dont get me wrong they weren't bad, just not anything that made my mouth explode with flavor.  Pork Intestine stew - very tasty, a bit salty, but worth the buck  Garlic Potatoes - Do not order, very bland, not garlicy enough, I would've been more satisfied eating french fries from mcdonalds with garlic salt.  Stir Fried Squid - salty and buttery, the first few bites were delicious but order a side of onigiri to cancel out the saltyness.  Cheesy Tomato Potato - Call me weird but I liked this one the most.  I just don't think you can fail with cheddar cheese and potatoes on a skillet pan.",

Bitter no matter how you dress it, so as I normally do with most foods that lack punch, I ADD  hot sauce or for Japanese sakes, I add schichimi-togarashi aka jap msg!   Maguro carpaccio; Better than the first, still lacking the powwww! I try not to use Bammmmm, cuz u know why.... A bit much on the sesame oil, I'd say add ponzu and call it a day  Shishito peppers;  Not a hard thing to grill, no marinade, just some salt, yet still no giddyup. (add togarashi). O how I love my IchiZa, sorry had to say dat...  Sunagimo; chicken gizzards, yes that's right..... Really wanted to like this spot, but this item fell flat on it's gizzard, small, dry, bland, just a gizzard, some msg may perk it up? Did I just say that? Ya, msg is magical powder, all tastes good with a lil sprinkle of the magic Chinese fairy dust!  Kushi-kawa; chicken skin Now this dish turns the tables a bit, Crisppity outside, soft fatty inside, tasty fatty crispy fatty, add lemon n of course some jMSG, now this is what I like! I need 4 more orders STAT!!!   Tsukune; pork n chicken meat stick Get ur mind outta the gutter! This one was ordered w tare sauce, lighter than teriyaki but same taste, maybe I shulda ordered the rest like this, u can choose either salt or tare (sauce) This was good, salty, saucy, came w egg yolk dip (add togarashi) 2nd best so far Just think Japanese meatloaf n u got it  BEER; Asahi on draft at $5.50 is a premium price, Orion 633ml is $6.95 Either way u need it for izakaya!  Overall a bit of a let down, it's been 2 months in operation so they should have stretched their legs already, decor and ambiance is good, service is attentive, quality is there, the delivery needs some tweaking (MSG) I would give them another shot but they gottta have more to give!   We shall see, oh and the special \"today's sunomono\" should be yesterday's pass on this one......  I need another beer.....  L8tR",

    "text": "After three strikes I had decided this place was out, and then the strikes kept on coming. I have no idea how this place has so many good ratings.  1.This place reeked like rotten fish and sewerage. If I hadn't gone with my boyfriend and his buddy, I would have walked right out. I wanted to be sick when we first sat down. 2. My boyfriend ordered a spicy salmon roll and the waitress tried to upsell him on some fancy spicy tuna roll. NO, he just wanted a simple roll. And he ordered spicy Salmon, NOT spicy Tuna! 3. They were out of Asahi beer. 4. The food and utencils came out in the wrong order. We got our rolls, and then our soy sauce dishes and chop sticks came out with our combo meal. 5. The portions were skimpy! Let's just say they gave us water in beer glasses, and then the beer came out in mugs that were smaller than the beer glasses the water came in. WTF 6. And the service was slow....   The only reason I'd even give this place two stars is because the actual quality of the sushi was good, although I think some of the rolls were a little bland. And both my boyfriend and I liked the spicy salmon...  The spicy salmon that the waitress did not want to sell us. Ha",

    "text": "\"Kokyaku Wa Yameru No Ka!\"  This is the enthusiastic phrase that will deafen you as you exit Kyara after your meal...   Now... I asked myself why the Wait-Staff would shout to high-heaven an utterance such as this... Didn't I leave an adequate tip? Did they notice some of the Chopsticks and / or Napkins missing? (Oops. My Bad!). Or, is it just a form of embarrassment?  Translated to the English - \"Customer is Leaving!\".  ... Just be prepared for it when you leave. What is the appropriate response? \"Sayonara!\"? ... as you walk to your car?  On the menu...  Chu-Hi ($4.80 x 2) Copper Ridge Chardonnay ($4.50) Orion Beer ($6.90)   Mango Chu-Hi (**** $4.80) A Fruity, Mango, Chu-Hi Sake Cocktail. Too much of a Soft-Drink for my tastes... need to be reminded it's alcoholic please...  Gyu Shabu Salad (***** $6.50) Thinly sliced, broiled Beef in a bowl-full of Spinach and other Greens in a creamy, white Sauce.  Miso Soup ($2.00) Butabara Reisei ($4.50) Pork Belly in Ramen. Cheese Tempura with Fig Jam ($6.50) Hotate Capa ($6.50) Japanese Scallops. Hirama Oba Age ($7.00) Breaded deep fried. Shiso, and Havarti Cheese wrapped with Halibut   Butabara (***** $2.20 x 2) Cold Pork Belly (cooked) on a Stick. Fantastic! Daughter-in-Law refused to touch it...  Sunagimo (Chicken Gizzards) (**** 1/2 $1.90 x2) Gizzards on a Stick! Gizzards that are better than you'd get from a Whole Chicken that I'd get at the Super-Market!  Japanese Sticky Rice (**** 1/2 $2.50) A little pricey... At the end of the meal, we found out re-fills are FREE! Wish Kyara would have told us this at the beginning of the meal!!! Only got one-refill...  Koro Koro Steak (***** $9.50) A grilled & cubed Sansho Rib-Eye Steak with Japanese Peppers & Red Chili Peppers, and cooked in spicy Sesame Soy Sauce.  Hokke Shio Yaki (** 1/2 $6.50) Grilled Atka Fish... over-grilled. Sorry Kyara... you just can't grill it this long without losing tenderness....  Chicken Garlic Ponzu ($5.80) Stir fried chicken with Garlic Ponzu. Aburi Gyu (** $4.50) Seared Mackerel. Over-Baked. Tenderness totally lacking.  Niku Tofu ($5.50) Tofu with Beef Stew.  Atmosphere (*** 1/2) Kyara characterizes itself as a Izakaya (ala Ichiza)... don't think so. When you walk in, the first thing you notice is the starkness of the establishment... brand new Stainless Steel behind the bar area; to the right are the semi-private dining areas separated by some thin strips of Pine with the most uncomfortable seats... er, stools,  I've sat on - you have to sit with a stiff back constantly during your meal. There is Wood Bench Seating against the wall but it does not look at all comfortable - still you have to have a good, stiff back. Austere would describe this restaurant nicely...  .A hint of the formality the Kyara tries to present is when you're seated at the dining tables... Black Chopsticks placed in front of you horizontally sitting on porcelain Chopstick Rests. Haven't seen this Japanes-y-like presentation in quite a while.  My youngest noticed the Japanese group of four seated right next to us in the dining area... the group consisted of a young couple and two elderly gentlemen. My son told us afterwards that the young man during the whole time, seemingly, was re-inforcing his social authority to the subservient male waiter. I don't think that group would be able to do that at Ichiza...  Our group, with my youngest son, daughter-in-law, and daughter decided to forego Dessert... as my son wanted to prepare a Black-Cherry Root Beer Float at home, which, BTW, turned out more than satisfying.  In summary, Grilled Tapas turned out over-grilled more often than not, but overall... a very satisfying experience despite the stuffy atmosphere. To compare Kyara with Ichiza is really unfair, though... because each establishment is trying to attract different type of customers; but Ichiza fulfills the definition of what a Izakaya establishment is supposed to be...Informal and, most of all, Casual.",

I love carbs and this place has the best/most authentic sushi rice I have tasted (thus far)   I recommend getting those items stated above, and the kimchi pork. The kimchi pork dish has a generous portion so be prepared to share!",

    "text": "We've been wanting to dine here for quite some time now.  I'm glad we finally had the time to do so.  My overall first impression was that the place looked nice.  I had no clue about the price, but it looked as if it would be a bit pricey.  In actuality though, it's quite affordable.  I loved the ambiance and the service was excellent!  Ordered: Yuzu Chili Salmon Salad:  They had Ahi Poke on the menu, which would usually be my go-to selection, but I figured I'd switch it up and try the Yuzu Chili Salmon Salad.  The Salmon is thinly sliced and is prepared seared.  The greens consisted on Arugula.  The bitterness of the Arugula accompanied the taste of the seared fish well.    Agedashi Tofu:  I love Tofu prepared in this manner.  The tofu itself was perfect, but my complaint is the broth that it was served it.  It was very strong in taste and overpowered the rest of the dish.  I probably won't order this again.  Buta Bara:  One of the many selections of skewers available, Buta Bara is Pork Belly.  If you are a fan of Pork Belly, I highly recommend giving this a try.  It was cooked to perfection (in my opinion) with the edges providing a slight crunch.  Tori Chazuke:  This is our first time ordering this dish.  It is a chicken and rice dish served drowning in a broth.  It was reminiscent of a Filipino dish I am familiar with:  Tenola, but not as appetizing.  The Tori Chazuke was bland in flavor.  The chicken was pulled of the bone and is served skinless.  The broth needed a douse of chili powder, salt, and pepper to  heighten the flavors.  It can say though, it was a heavy dish.  Personally, I wouldn't recommend this.  Ika Maru:  Probably one of my favorite items on the menu.  It is a whole squid that is served grilled.  Nothing too fancy about this dish, but I'm a big fan of Squid and really had no complaints.  I'd definitely order it again on a future visit.  Recommended.  Tori Karaage:  This was another of my favorite dishes of the evening.  I'm not sure how to explain what this is;  think of fried chicken turned into calamari.  The breading provided a nice crunch.  Don't forgot to drizzle it the dish with a freshly squeezed lemon wedge to give it a touch of tanginess!  Recommended.  Green Tea Waffle:  I had to get dessert.  This is exactly what it sounds like.... Green Tea powder mixed in a waffle batter and then topped with Vanilla Ice Cream.  It's a good portion to share amongst two.  Pros: *  Excellent Customer Service & Ambiance *  Very affordable, authentic Japanese Tapas (it only cost $45 for all the above) *  Yes, there was some dishes I didn't favor, but overall Great food!  Cons: *  Aside from the dishes I disliked, there really wasn't any negatives to this place.  Overall: I arrived a little before it opened for dinner time and instead of standing outside we were invited to sit in the waiting area =)  That was already a favorable first impression for me.  We got to here them doing their little prep meeting before opening, alongside their group cheer.  If you are big on service and enjoy Japanese Tapas, Kyara is definitely recommended!  Tips: *  Awesome hot tea (it's on the house). *  There's a white board in front that highlights specials of the day.   *  Check out their Facebook page for daily specials too. *  This place can be fun for both group dining and a date =)",

Sitting at the bar, I could see the food being prepared, and I noticed something being served that looked interesting. I asked what it was, and they said it was a special they were testing that isn't on the menu. They offered to make me one, which was such a WOW experience... On top of that, it was sooooooo good (some fried pork bits on cabbage sitting in some sweet and spicy sauce)!  Definitely worth checking out!",

    "text": "My husband and I came in for lunch. I had the steak lunch special and he had the curry lunch special. The food was good and the price was right.  The green tea waffle dessert was delicious. The two stars is for the food and price ONLY. The service was mediocre at best. The servers were prompt but not very warm or friendly.  I give zero stars for an attempt at dinner. Since I am pregnant, I was craving the green tea waffle dessert. We decided to try the dinner service. As soon as we walked in, the man at the door rudely said I will be right with you. He immediately turned his back to me and stormed off as I stood by the podium waiting for a couple minutes before I realized that he wasn't coming back. We decided to sit down and wait. The other two couples that were sitting in the front looked as if they were waiting a long time too. No one came back to the podium. I couldn't even talk to a person to inquire about wait times, place a togo order,  or put my name on the wait list. After 15 minutes of waiting for someone to come back to the podium, we decided to leave.  I used to be a hostess at a cafe and at a fine dining restaurant and there should always be someone at the door to greet and attend to the guests. The first impression  of a restaurant should be positive and this place left a bad impression.  There are many other japanese places that offer the same quality of food with good service. I WILL NOT BE RETURNING.",
