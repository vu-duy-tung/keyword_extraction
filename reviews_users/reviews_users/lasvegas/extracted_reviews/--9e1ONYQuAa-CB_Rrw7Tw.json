    "text": "TIP ON ORDERING STEAK: If you want a bigger cut of meat, get it rare to medium-rare.   Otherwise, if you order your meat medium-well, you get a smaller cut in order for it to cook well in the middle  I couldn't decide on a steak that night, and I wanted a little variety.  So I ordered a combination of 2 appetizers and a soup.  Soup: Lobster bisque was awesome mainly because they weren't stingy with the lobster meat.  Often when you order a seafood soup (e.g. clam chowder) they dump a lot of potatoes or other filling in there.  Not the case with this bisque.  A must for any bisque or lobster connoisseur.  Appetizer 1: Butternut squash ravioli w/duck was very tasty, and again, not stingy with the duck, which kind of looked like pulled pork but with duck meat.  Appetizer 2: Crawfish meat w/Crystal pepper sauce over linguine could have been a small meal in itself.  And just the right amount of that Crystal Hot Sauce to give it a solid Southern kick.  This was probably my favorite.  I did have a taste of the various meats too including the T-bone and filet mignon, both of which I recommend.  You don't get anything with it, so unless you just want meat, you'll probably need to order a side dish or two.",

From an ambience standpoint, this place is leagues better than Prime (not too many tables, decent lighting, not a lot of room noise) but not as cool as some of the newer rooms in Vegas.  All in all, a good place to go for steak.",

We received warm friendly smiles as soon as we arrived and were quickly at our table for 4.    I ordered a Filet Mignon medium rare with country smashed potatoes.  we also had the best prepared Caesar salad ever to encounter my taste buds made table side.    The steak just literally melted in my mouth.  I was in utter awe and in an orgasmic state.  With each tantalizing bite I felt I was being lifted into food heaven.  This was hands down the best Filet Mignon I have had thus far!  Our Server was kind funny and on point.  The wine selection is impressive and we had our two bottles to the last drop:)  Hey we were celebrating remember(hubby's bday)  I satisfyingly finished my meal off with a homemade sorbet This will be a memorable moment locked away in my taste buds memory!",

Even though there is so much good food to choose from in Vegas, all of us knew we wanted to go to a nice place for some good steak during our stay.    We've heard a lot of good things about Delmonico so it was pretty easy decision to try it out.     First things first.  Service was great.   We came late for our reservation.  No problem.   Some of us actually shared a couple steaks.  No problem.   Took pictures for us during a busy Saturday night.  No problem.  The important thing - the steak.   With 8 people around the table we were able to try various cuts.   Several guys got the bone-in rib eye.   One of the girls got the rib-eye, and I personally shared the new york strip with a friend.    I feel like I'm paying a premium for Vegas and/or Emeril.     Don't get me wrong, you'll definitely get a nice fat, juicy, flavorful steak here.     But I felt like I was getting more of my money's worth with the Kona Crusted Steak at Capital Grille (Chicago) or the Cowboy Cut at Taste of Texas (Houston).    The meat quality was much better and believe it or not, much more flavorful than Delmonico's steaks.  That being said, if you do go to Dominico's, definitely get the sautee'd mushrooms on the side.   Its a nice garlicky mix of mushrooms that compliments perfectly with the steaks!",

    "text": "So when you go to a restaurant like this please expect a bit of a drawn out dinner, I think it was two and a half hours for our large party. Many said it was the best food they had in their life, and it was really wonderful. I will say that the appetizers had far more imagination than the main course which was a bit deflating.   We went after a long day at a convection and most of us were tired and slightly delirious so the service being a tad slow made the dinner feel very much like The Cook, The Thief, His Wife and Her Lover. They do the thing where they set all the plates at once and the glasses never went empty and the wine list is to die for, they had a 15000 dessert wine that dated before the Titanic.   One star is really for the main course not living up the expectations set previously.",

I asked the host if I can pick up my bone-in steak with my hand and eat.  His answer: \"Only if you lift up your pinky.\"  Ha, clever!

Being a celebrity chefs place I had my doubts but will always try something at least once. Delmonico did not disappoint, they delivered on par excellent service and quality food in a classy but intimate ambiance. We have already arranged to go back in the coming Vegas trip. The steaks, as you would expect, were above expectations in taste, searing, and quality of beef. Most importantly in order to enjoy a good meal you need impeccable service along with it. It was the kind of service that is very professional and classy but in a way that makes you feel welcome and comfortable, not stiff and robotic. Its an experience you have to try for yourself that you won't regret. The NY strip will turn a vegetarian!",

Those types of establishments require that celebrity chef to attach their name to drive new customers.

My father told me to come here while I was in town and I'm so glad that I did. Vegas is full of traps and this one was not a trap at all, and if it was a trap I wandered in willingly.  The \"Book of Whisky\" is MASSIVE. Largest whisky/single malt/irish/worldwide whiskey list I've ever seen. I partook in a nice Yamazaki 12 (world renowned shit) and felt adventurous and tried an Amrut from India which was delectable and spicy as well.   The STEAK. I put it up there with Toro Toro as #1/#2 of all time. Flavorful, crunchy char, a nice butter sauce that only Emeril himself can probably cook up, and the service to match.  I sat at the bar and my server was knowledgeable, attentive, and would come around the bar to take care of me which was unnecessary, but appreciated.

The staff was extremely friendly and nice. They gave excellect table service and I didn't have to ask for anything.   We started our meal with some drinks. I ordered the Brooklyn Yard and my god this gin and juice concoction was so amazing I had two which is alot for this lightweight. We also ordered the BBQ Shrimp and Crispy Fried Oysters and as expected it was heavenly and I savored every bite.   For dinner I ordered off the Summer Trio menu and chose the New Orleans Gumbo, the Sirloin Strip Steak with Asparagus and the Caramel Butter Cake with Vanilla Cream. The gumbo was just alright. It was good but I felt the roux was too rich and over powered the other ingredients. Although this made me sad I can honestly say I make a kick ass gumbo that taste better but I owe that in part to the many episodes of Emeril Live I've watched, lol. The Sirloin Strip Steak was cooked perfectly but it was lacking in flavor. It tasted like plain meat, no BAM and it was definitely not kicked up a notch. But the Caramel Butter Cake with Vanilla Cream made up for the steak. It was everything a butter cake is suppose to be, buttery, fluffy and just delicious goodness. Because I am a heifer I ordered the Banana Cream Pie too as this is a signature dessert of Delmonico's and the server sweared it was the best dessert on the menu. He lied, lol. It was good but the Caramel Butter Cake was much better.   Although I didn't have a five star experience I will be back to give Delmonico's another try.",

Could have ate like 5 orders of them they were so good. I ordered wagyu fillet. Best steak I have. Flavor amazing, melted in your mouth and was just insanely good. Guest got the strip I think...? Or ribeye haha don't remember but whatever it was it was great too. We had twice baked potatoes, great. And the duck egg creme brulee, great except the sugar was a little too hard and tasted a little burnt in spots but that's the only complaint. The service was beyond amazing too. So attentive and very nice. Will be coming back here often",

We told them our anniversary and was served a complimentary amuse-bouche and sorbet dessert at the end.  Yay: -Truffle Parmesan potato chips: freshly made and amazing in flavor. You can taste all the elements of this working well together. I thought the truffle oil was going to overwhelm the dish but it was nicely perfumed throughout and complimented the freshly grated Parmesan. The chips were thin, crispy and airy. I almost ate the whole thing before my meal but had to stop myself.   Other: -Ribeye steak special: the special of the day was a petite rib eye with foie gras. The steak otherwise would have been bland had it not been for the foie gras. It was perfectly cooked to my medium rare preference.  -Ribeye: my bf got the regular ribeye without the special and it come out to be almost the same size as my petite filet. It was slightly seasoned more than mine. However when we reheated the leftover steaks, mine held up better and the foie gras melted into the meat flavoring it better than this one.  -Mashed potatoes: just regular, nothing fancy.",

I had the Japanese wagyu fillet mignon which comes with a pretty hefty price tag of $115 however it was easily the most delectable food of and kind i have eaten and was so tender that i could cut it with the side of my fork. It was heaven on a plate that simple. This place is quite expensive but unlike most restaurants on the strip this establishment truly warrants the fee. Additionally i ordered lemondrops and the lemon cream pie both were excellent.",

A handful of shrimp which tasted farm raised and lacked a good wild shrimp taste. Tuna tartare was great and the crab legs were great.  Warm wilted spinach salad ($15) came out with a deep fried soft boiled egg and bacon with candy pecans baked on it. There was spinach in there but a 2000 calorie salad isn't really that much of a salad. Still it was good.  Added to that the bone in 45 day aged ribeye ($50). That was magnificent. Huge, flavorful and all around award winning.  Had the creamed spinach ($10), creamed corn ($10) and steak fries ($10). The creamed corn want good. It was just bland. The rest were good.  Service is exceptional. Had a few Tito vodka Martina's with blue cheese olives as well Jacob were expertly made. For 5 of us the total bill was close to $1000. Be prepared to spend $$$.",

    "text": "Husband suggested that we come back here for lunch today. They started us off with two bread poppers each which were not bad. I ordered a lobster bisque soup as starter which was insanely delicious. Probably one of the better lobster bisques I've ever tasted.  It has big chunks of lobster meat in the soup.  Although the first sip of the soup seemed a little salty, the flavor is very good, strong and savory. It is one of my favorite dishes here.   My husband ordered the beef carpaccio arugula salad because the salad we normally order from here is no longer on the menu. We were not sure what to order but after we tasted the salad we loved it. It is a very large salad which almost felt like a meal and it has a very clean balanced savory taste.  My husband says that this was one of his favorite salads; me on the other hand I still like the old salad I used to older here.  maybe I'm just more old-school and like my salad plain with arugula, spinach, tomatoes and good cheese.   We ordered two entrees. One was the salmon entree which was insanely divine. It is served with a big piece of salmon fillet with grilled sweet corn and crab pieces which complimented the salmon impeccably. Both my husband and I love this dish and we both indicated that we will be ordering this again in the future when we come back here. In fact we may each order one of this salmon dish. That is how much we love this dish. It is very delicious. Any salmon lover should definitely give the salmon dish a try.  The other entree that we ordered was the lobster sliders. I did not know that this was a cold sandwich dish. I personally do not like cold sandwiches and also I only like my lobster done the traditional way so that you can taste the natural fresh sweet flavors of a good lobster. The lobster sliders had some kind of seasoning/dressing to it. Although they did not skimp on the lobster meat and they do give you a lot of big chunks of lobster meat with the sliders, the taste was not to my personal liking. I think I will stick with the salmon entree and my lobster bisque in the future.  Come check out this place when you're in town. You will not be disappointed.",

The waitress was excellent at recommending wines that would pair well with each course as well as my budget. To top things off it does tend to be the little things that stand out sometimes and for me a little detail about Delmonico's is that they serve these amazingly light fluffy and delicious popovers in place of your run of the mill bread basket.",

They made sure we were completely taken care of throughout the whole experience.  We chose a bottle of a wine for the meal and it paired perfectly. The wine list was the most extensive list I had seen in a long time. It was all broken down by style of wine and where the grapes originated from. Then we chose the house salad to pair with a half dozen oysters. The oysters were absolutely wonderful and the dressing for the house salad was great as well. I ordered crab crusted medallions and my boyfriend ordered the filet. Both came out perfectly cooked and melted in your mouth. We were too stuffed to take on the desert menu but the overall experience at Delmonico was delicious. I would recommend to anyone and everyone.",

We ordered the bone-in rib eye. YOU MUST ORDER that, especially if you're a steak eater. Medium rare, and that's how steak should always be. We also tried the Grilled Filet Mignon Medallions, which we overdone, Medium Rare my a$$, it was more like medium well-well done. but it did have a good taste. I don't believe in returning food.  The creamed corn was the shiznit. It was soooooo good. And the asparagus was good too, tender and perfectly buttered.   Of course I can't skip dessert, had the creme brulee, which as ok. A bit too much sugar on top, but overall not bad. We had a bday and was given banana sorbet - gross. :P But the brioche bread pudding w/ bourbon and ice cream. was to die for.

With many spots only open for dinner service I opted to dine at one of the few with a lunch menu -- Delmonico.    We started with the wild arugula salad -- shaved apple, candied walnuts tossed in champagne vinaigrette with a trio of artisan cheeses. It was a large portion that they split for us.  My wife had a steak panini served medium rare on ciabatta. The accompanying horseradish was overpowering, but the beef was still excellent. The sandwich came with some amazingly crispy and light truffle fries.  The lobster sliders I ordered was a small order of two. The Maine lobster was lightly dressed with a citrus aioli and celery leaves, helping make this some of the tastiest lobster you'll find in any sandwich in town. The Old Bay fries that they came with were tasty, but not nearly as good as the truffle fries. My only complaint about this dish is the size. Something this delicious shouldn't be constrained to two sliders per order.  4.5 Stars",

The waiter made our experience a very easy one. He offered many different suggestions and options. After we finally made our decision, the kind gentleman complimented us with bread and such. Afterwards, he poured our glasses with wine and afterwards treated the birthday girl to some lovely dessert. On to the food...  At first I was on a budget, but then I said to myself, might as well splurge a little so i ordered the filet mignon and I have to admit, it was deeeeelicious. I did not order any sides with it, and wish i had ordered some sort of baked or mash potatoes.   overall, i had a great experience and I would definitely refer someone to this place for great food and great service.",

This means the acoustics in the room we were in were spot on.   Our waiter was Lamont and there were various other folks helping us out. We were all served warm buttery rolls that had both a salt and we are pretty sure bit of sugar sprinkling on them. Drinks were ordered by a few of us-I imbibed just a bit as it was my birthday after all and the drinks were good, reasonably priced and tasty.   Everything we ate was wonderful. We started with 2 orders of house made potato chips with truffle oil and Parmesan. They were yummy and the perfect combination of salt and grease to help the booze go down easily. Some of us had starters, some of us chose not to.   I had the lobster bisque to start and it was heavenly with perfectly cooked lobster and nice pieces of it. Others had the Gumbo (no seafood-heat but not hot), the heirloom tomato and Burrata cheese salad. There were also a couple of other appetizers ordered-BBQ Shrimp (delicious and unlike anything we had before) and Escargot(I was too chicken to try it). Truffle Parmesan potato chips  For mains, people had  Filets Bone In Rib-eye  Salmon Scallops Medallions of beef  Since sides are generous, we all shared: Asparagus Creamed Corn-delicious (and I make my own just as good) Creamed Spinach (the most boring) Sauteed Mushrooms-fabulous Potato Gratin Twice Baked Potatoes Grits (meh-but not for me texturally)  We were all so full, we only ordered one dessert to share and that was the infamous Banana cream pie. Worth every bite and every calorie-in fact....  Kevin and I came back here for lunch our last day in Vegas! We shared the BBQ shrimp, I had the lobster bisque again and he had the heirloom tomato salad. We also shared another slice of the banana cream pie and I would do it again in a heartbeat.   Fabulous birthday dinner and wonderful company!",

Not much attention to the customers' answers to their questions, not much attention to if the customer is enjoying what is served, long periods of absolute inattention while the 4 people that we were told will be taking care of us tonight pass by to other tables.  Asked for medium rare, and received a fairly well done steak dry and served cold on a cold plate.  After 15 minutes, my guests had finished eating, server came by to confirm everything was fine.  Sitting with my complete steak minus one bite before me I said no.  Reminded them I was looking for a bone in NY medium rare and if at all  possible bring it out before it is cold, and warm plate would be wonderful as well.  They took my plate away and returned in 10 minutes with the same steak now hot but black (for real) on the outside and thoroughly well done.  Plate was set down and off the server went to another table.  10 minutes later he saw it sitting there and asked if it was not OK.  I again repeated what I had ordered.  Then, with some attitude he said, \"Let me just start over on it\".  Fifteen minutes later a new steak hit the table and again over cooked.  At that point I just gave up, ate my cold baked potato and drank my wine.   For a $600 meal for three people (thats after they graciously didn't charge me for the NY, I left saying never again.  And that's a drag because this place was once a tip top steakhouse.  The best steak I ever had was here at Delmonico.",

The \"feel\" and atmosphere of the restaurant was dull and drab, with chairs lining the walls towards the restaurant which seems to be very far away from the main dining area, loud noises from kids with no supervision and an atmosphere that  just wasn't romantic and inviting. If I had to do it again I would go somewhere else,  as there are many other restaurants on The Strip where you can spend in excess of  $150 and get more value. The most impressive part of the meal was the attentive wait staff, they were extremely professional, courteous and attended to our every need.  The other Emeril's restaurant at the MGM Grand was superb, I'm not sure what is going on with Delmonico. Hopefully mgmt. will do more to make the experience more enjoyable. Hope this review helps.",

My girlfriends and I were totally famished when we got into Vegas, thank goodness we had made reservations beforehand. We didn't wait long and had a drink in the lounge as we waited to be seated.  After browsing the menu, my friend and I decided to split the bone-in ribeye, medium well. Our server says it's their house specialty. The steak was completely blackened from the char and the inside was perfectly done. As I cut into it with my knife, I can tell it's going to be chewy....and indeed it was. It had almost no flavor for a dry aged meat. My friend had to ask for steak sauce and sour cream to make it more flavorful.  BUT, the sides we ordered (potato gratin and creamed corn) were awesome! AND my friend's filet mignon was the most tender I've ever had (she gave me some of hers)  The service was impeccable and friendly...but the food (at least what I ate) was not worth $52 for a steak.",

    "text": "You know the expression about sailors having a woman in every port. Well, on my recent trip to the USA, I had Yelpers in every town to host, entertain and amuse!  Vegas Elite Dennis T was my lunch companion when I was in town. Not only was he gracious enough to clear some time in his busy schedule to have lunch with me but I was honoured that he made our meal together his 100th review  Dennis gave me a list of tempting options for lunch. I had to watch how much I was going to have for lunch as I had a dinner reservation at Raku that evening for the kaiseki menu but the lobster sliders at Delmonico caught my eye, so that was my choice.  I had a nice time wandering through the Venetian on my way to Delmonico. The size and scale of U.S. buildings in general amaze me but the Venetian is certainly very ornate and I enjoyed looking at the menus while walking down restaurant row on the way to Delmonico  I instantly recognised Dennis from his Yelp picture and like all the Yelpers I've met, conversation flowed like we were old friends. So much so that unusually for Yelpers, we were chatting so much that ordering took awhile as we hadn't look at the menu the first few times that our waiter approached to take our order  The restaurant is certainly decked out to appeal to the higher end of customer. It was a quiet lunch service when we dined and while it provided a good ambiance for chatting, I perhaps didn't see Delmonico as the busy celebrity chef steakhouse that it is.  I had already decided on my main course of lobster sliders and using my personal rule of taking the opportunity of eating foods that I don't come across often, I paired that with an appetiser of traditional New Orleans gumbo. I'm not in any position to comment on the authenticity of the gumbo but as Emeril Lagasse started his celebrated celebrity chef trail with his first restaurant Emeril's in New Orleans, I'm guessing he can cook a good gumbo. Mine was certainly pungent with a great depth of flavour from a carefully stock. Being Asian, I was also impressed to see that the rice had been cooked well  Dennis was pleased with his appetiser of lobster bisque followed by Caesar salad  It may seem odd to eschew steak at a steakhouse. However, I've always liked the sound of lobster roll but still haven't tried one yet. I saw these lobster sliders as the nearest I could get until I make my trip to the northeast to try a real lobster roll. Well, the sliders were excellent - soft rolls containing morsels of sweet lobster meat mixed with the right amount of mayonnaise and seafood dressing.  Dennis however wasn't quite as lucky with his fillet steak, which arrived looking rather lonely on the plate. Dennis decided to order some bearnaise to correct this loneliness but it took a long time to appear and when it did, it seemed a bit watery.  In an effort to not be too piggy, Dennis and I split the banana cream pie. Well, the combination of banana, pie, whipped cream, caramel and chocolate shavings pleased my palate probably more than my arteries! I don't have a really sweet tooth but I really enjoyed this  Dennis was kind enough to give a lift back to my hotel down the Strip, which gave me a good touristy view of the sights  A friendship sealed. A celebrity chef ticked off. Lobster sliders consumed. A most successful lunch rendezvous indeed!",

Their food and service has always exceeded my expectations.  Secondly, their Pan Seared Foie Gras literally took my breath away because I was enjoying it so much I damn near forgot to breath.  That is saying a lot because normally I don't like liver!  For a quick recommendation, try their filet mignon, duck or ask for their filet medallions, it is off the menu but the flavor is amazing.

    "text": "This is my favorite restaurant in the United States, bar none.  Some of the best service and atmosphere I've ever seen in a restaurant, anywhere. For example....  A few days before one visit, I called to request that the Peanut Butter Cream Pie, a dessert special from a past trip, be once again on the desert menu. When we showed up for dinner, we didn't see the pie on the menu, but were informed that the chef had made and saved an ENTIRE pie just for our party. It was unbelievable.  And oh the food....  ** Warning: this meal is a marathon. If you're not a big eater, don't be afraid to share appetizers, order smaller steaks, skip the rolls, etc so that you can room for all parts of this amazing, amazing meal.  **** Appetizers **** -- Lobster bisque is the clear ungodly standout. -- All the salads are routinely excellent. -- Skip the tuna tartare and tomato soup -- they aren't as impressive. -- The free rolls are really, really excellent.  **** Wine **** -- For those that (like me) enjoy wine but aren't connoisseurs, the Fisticuffs cabernet is my go-to. It goes great with all steaks at a reasonable ($55) price.  **** Steak **** -- Ribeye is the obvious play, and is amazing (and huge), but the filet is outstanding for those who want something smaller and not quite as rich. -- Try Au Poivre style for really powerful flavor. Steak purists should do the ribeye straight up, but those who like peppery and lightly sweet flavors would love the filet au poivre. -- I am told that they serve entrees besides steak, but I have never, ever seen anyone be so misguided as to come here and fail to order a steak.  **** Sides **** -- Usually we have one person order all the sides for the group, just to make sure we get a good mix of them so everyone can try everything. They're served family-style, and are big enough for ~3 people to have some. -- Twice baked potato (which has gratuitous amounts of cheese and bacon) is incredible, albeit heavy. Two can share, but my friends insist on ordering their own. -- Mushrooms are some of the best I've had, and go perfectly with the steak. -- Broccoli or asparagus is a good choice to contrast the rich steak.  **** Desserts **** -- Oatmeal pecan pie is one of my favorite desserts anywhere. You will want a whole one yourself after one bite, so order accordingly. -- Banana cream pie is well known and hyped, for good reason. It is also enormous. -- Skip the bread pudding and peach cobblers -- they're good but not in the same league.",

Service- top notch.  Mind you, everything is a la carte.I cant help but feel underdressed even though we were dressed well for the venue.  They have an insane wine list that goes on and on.  I had the bone-in ribeye which was done to perfection - medium rare.  We also had the creamed spinach and wild mushrooms.  So good we finished everything leaving little to no room for dessert.  Definitely should try the dessert since they all looked exceptional, especially Emeril's claim to fame Banana Cream Pie!",

I ate semi light for my dinner: a crab bisque soup, spinach salad, and a baked potato.  All of it was very very good.  Being that said, that still cost me $35 easy. There really is no cheap thing to eat here, other then the sides that went for $9 a pop.  The atmosphere is pretty relaxed.  The service is good.  They paid attention to the little things that mattered like re-filling up your water when your cup is empty, and coming back every 10 minutes or so to ask if you need anything else.  Be prepared to bring a chunk of change with ya...steaks costs anywhere from $50 to $60 depending on how you want it prepped or what kind of steak you want.  I would try this place again, and see if the steak is really that damn good.",

Ordered our steaks medium well and they came served to us like a bloody mess.  More like steak tar tar than medium well...basically very rare.  Sent them back and never saw them again.  The waiter had also taken our sides back just to keep them warm, and we never saw them again either.  Manager kept apologizing over and over telling us it would be \"just another minute,\" but we never got our food.  Other tables were having the same experience.  It was a Thursday evening, 7:30 p.m., not especially crowded.  We were so disappointed as we were looking forward to it so much.  Don't think I'll ever waste my time there again.  A good manager would have comped our drinks (only two) and salads, but we were charged for them.  Also charged us for the three sides until we brought it to his attention and he removed it from the bill.",

We got there in plenty of time and explained that we wanted to sit and enjoy our experience and planned on being there for awhile.  We were told that it was no problem and they were happy to have us as long as we like.  We were never once rushed or pushed out like at a lot of places just trying to turn tables even though we were there 2-3 hours.  The service was amazing but not to the point where you were harrassed...our drinks were never empty and plates never sat long but it seems we never noticed the waiter coming and going which is awesome.  We took our time with drinks, appetizers, and dinner and all were timed perfectly and served when we were ready.  The food was amazing as well!  I had the escargot and the bone-in ribeye which was the best steak I have ever had!  I have had a lot of steaks from so called steakhouses and top recommended restaurants, this is definitely tops!  My wife had the lobster bisque and king crab legs which were also absolutely delicious.  The prices are higher, but it goes directly with the service and quality of food and I have no problem paying for what we got.  We will definitely go back...now if we could only catch Emeril there!",

I got the BBQ shrimp and the Filet Mignon ordered specifically MEDIUM RARE. The BBQ shrimps are four tiny shrimps that are by no means jumbo shrimps but suspiciously resembled frozen out of a bag.   And then is the Filet Mignon. They overcooked it so much that when I taste it, I almost wanted to cry. It can hardly pass for well done. I was so hungry and I waited 35 minutes for it. But I had to wash it down my throat with water. If this is MEDIUM RARE, then I will be ordering a live cow next time. The manager Michael did come by, confirmed that the steak is overcooked and asked if they can take it back. (I cannot wait for another 30 minutes for a new one. Doesn't a customer's time mean anything to you?) This is nice. But when the chef finished cooking my steak, how can he decide this is OK to serve? He must have cared so little about how his customer would think to decide to serve me this. LET ME TELL YOU. IT IS NO DIFFERENT THAN SPITTING IN MY FACE.  Paid 95 dollars for the bill. I am feeling like a complete loser right now. Good thing is at least I came alone. If I have brought my GF, she would think I want a break up. And Michael, next time this happens, just take 20 dollars off the bill. You guys can never be a top notch restaurant.",

Our reservations were at 10pm Sunday night we got seated right away.   I do feel bad for giving 1 start because the service was EXCELLENT. However the food was soo dissapointing. We ordered calamari to share- the marinara sauce that accompanied it tasted like Ragu from a jar. Like I said 7 girls with 1 order of calamari there was more then 80% left on the plate. We then got our salads which i have nothing to complain about then again it was just greens and dressing- I ordered the cowboy ribeye which they are known for and the most popular menu item. I ordered it Medium. We also ordered creamed corn, spinich, potatoes au gratin, and asparagus.   Cowboy Ribeye Steak- WORST STEAK EVER!!! it was over cooked too chewey and tasted old- I thought maybe it was just me but I had 3 of the girls taste and they thought the same- Really dissapointed :(  Creamed Spinich- Undercooked   Potatoes Au Gratin- Good but not the best I had ever had lacked flavor  Asparagus- Cant go wrong with that  Bottle of Wine was excellent we had the Cuvee  Bottom line we were really dissapointed. I am not the type to complain so we did not let the staff know- You would think that they would notice we hardly ate anything but whatever. I know I wont be going there ever again or recommending it to anyone either.   service was good but what good is the service if the food sucked this bad :(",

The service was very good and noise level was acceptable wherein it was easy to carry on a conversation.  I had the BBQ shrimp as my appetizer which was very good.  But as to the main entree, I was very disappointed in the quality of the NY strip.  This piece of meat was described as prime but in reality I thought it was more of a select grade ... I have had choice from the grocery store that was more tender.  Initially, I thought maybe my steak was an anomaly and did not want to complain since were invited out to dinner. However, then  another person in our party also stated his steak was very tough and was only able to eat about a quarter of his steak ... Gave up and moved on to eat only the side dishes, which were very good I may say.  We all shared the desserts ... I really enjoyed the Banana Cream pie.  Even though there were some good things about this restaurant still rated it lower based on the poor quality of prime steak I had relative to the cost of the steak ... In essence it still was not worth the dining experience even though I was not the one paying.",

I have never been disappointed.  Last weekend for the second time in my life was lucky enough to have the Chef's Table that over looks the kitchen. As with the last time I ate in the Chef's Table it rates as the top 5 meals I have ever had in my life. You don't order at the chef's table you enjoy each course that chef personally prepares for you.  Each course is better then  the previous. Some of my favorite dishes in the dining room are: Steak Tartare-very tasty served with toasted baguette. Emeril's New Orleans Barbecue Shrimp, an original menu item, that is so delicious. My favorite steak is the Bone in Rib Eye, a great piece meat that is aged in house. The service at Delmonico is second to none, what  they are noted for is that everybody at the table get there plate at the same time, a real nice touch. Great side dishes,creamed corn and twice cooked potatoes are my favorite. Service is always top notch. A can't miss I will be back soon.",

Yes there are plenty of them around all the hotels and to be honest, they have a good one at every single hotel, it is a matter of you choosing the one that either is more convenient for you or if there is one that you like no matter which hotel you are at.   We were at the Venitian and we came across this spot.   Here is the breakdown:  FOOD  Very tasty and tender the steaks. Cook at the right temperature and I definitely appreciate when they cook medium rare when I ask-- most time it comes rare.   The appetizers are also pretty good and I enjoyed a lot.   SERVICE  Very good service, I really enjoyed and appreciate when the waiters take time and go out of the way to make you feel welcomed. They constantly came to check on us-- however, without being annoying.  DECOR/ AMBIANCE  The decor is ok and it is a nice spot to have a finally meal without the loud noise that we normally see at other restaurants in Vegas.

The highlight of the night was the bone-in bacon appetizer, which I highly recommend. It was outstanding and many of us wished we made that our dinner. I had the Salmon, which was ok and acceptable. There was no real difference between this entree and that of a nice salmon dish at any other mid-priced restaurant. It was good but forgettable, so don't recommend it.  It is a steakhouse after all and I was on a special diet that night. In taking with the rest of my guests, they stated their steak was average as well. The deserts were about the same and if not for the great service, it would've just been equal to dinner at any other average restaurant. For the price, I would try somewhere else.",

The food was all delicious, and the service was top notch. Bathrooms were clean as well as the restaurant.  You can find this restaurant inside the Venetian on restaurant row.",

It's something to be expected of a steakhouse of this quality, but that's not always the case. Michael and Drew were such a delight and enhanced our dinner experience.  Popovers are immediately served with creamy butter. These bread puffs are very light, flaky and savory.  Cocktails were good, whiskey and wine offering are extensive.  We were served complimentary crostini with a sun dried tomato bruschetta which was very scrumptious.  Our salad was the fine ripened heirloom tomato and buratta salad. WOW. I'm going back tomorrow to have this during lunch. It's beyond refreshing, fresh and flavorful. The vinegar dressing complemented the array of tomatoes, onions and burrata harmoniously. It is that good. Order it.  Our main courses were the bone in ribeye and New York steaks. We ordered them medium and they came a PERFECT medium. These were huge cuts. The creole seasoning had amazing flavor and texture. Every bite of the steak was juicy and oozing with flavor. We've been to a plethora of steakhouses and this one immediately shot up to the top of our favorites list.  To top it all off, we were served with a complimentary pumpkin spice ice cream (it tasted like a PSL in ice cream form) and hand written happy anniversary card.  Everything was phenomenal and we will definitely be coming back to the exceptional service and meals provided at Delmonico's.",

You will have 3 servers taking care of you the whole time.  We tried a few of their signature cocktails:  mojito, a basil ginger drink, and a pear delight.  All the drinks were fantastic.  We ordered 2 appetizers: prosciutto wrapped dates filled with blue cheese and ricotta stuffed squashed blossoms.  We could've stopped there and died from amazing food, but we are troopers!  Our entree we ordered was  chateaubriand for 2.  Chateaubriand steak is a meat dish cooked with a thick cut from the tenderloin filet.  They slice and finish the cooking process at your table and serve it to you with sauteed asparagus and these crispy potatoes with onions.  It is amazing and melts in your mouth.  Should we have stopped there?  Yes, we were already full!!!  But we are definitely not quitters and needed dessert!  We tried the duck egg creme brulee and the banana cream pie, which they're famous for.  Fantastic!!!!  Both were great in their own way.  The creme brulee was the right enough of creamy and sweet goodness.  The little water cookies and fruit added a surprisingly satisfying texture to it.  The banana cream pie is not like your mommas pie.  The bananas and cream are layered and makes it kind of like a layered cake.  The crust, whipped cream, chocolate shavings, and drizzled caramel meshed together well with the cold cream and bananas.  This was one of my favorite parts of the dinner and was clear they were famous for it.",

The night atmosphere was quietly dimmed but I didn't feel like I was in quite the right ambience to eat expensive steak. To each his or her own of course.  I will say that the service was spot on. Never was my glass empty or did I have to wait a long time for service.  I ordered the Wagyu Filet Mignon and my Girlfriend ordered the Bone-in Rib-eye. We were started off with soft, thin bread but I was not really a fan of the seasoning.   After a long while, our steaks arrived. While the insides were cooked nicely, the outsides were a bit burnt. A little too burnt, very black on the edges. On top of that, the residue left from the burnt steak surface left their markings on the plate.   The wagyu, while tender and light, lacked in serious flavour. It definitely was not worth the premium price. The Rib-eye was deemed their best meat, but it did not fully deliver as I would like. It's a shame it didn't come with any sides either. Eating just meat on a plate is very non-fancy imo.  Overall, I probably will not come back. The atmosphere felt a little too casual and the prices were a bit too high for the value and taste you get.",

The ambiance is nice and the service is good, as any high-class restaurant should be but the steak was sub-par. I've been to many steakhouses in my day, and let me tell you; the steak was just not good. We started off the night with some appetizers and drinks that were delicious. We ordered the lobster claws and tuna tarter, which was actually pretty good. Then we got to the steak. I have to admit, I was excited because Delmonico's is known for their steak, and I am a man who loves his red meat.   The first cut was rough and filled with cartilage / fat. It was very difficult to cut through, and I had to discard it because there was hardly any meat on it, more so just fat. After two or three bites, I started to accept my fate. I had a bad cut. The meat was underseasoned and not as juicy as medium rare should be. I thought maybe the meat was on the last days of expiration or something, but all in all, it just wasn't good. At places wehere I'm spending more than 60 bucks on a ribeye, I eat everything. I mean everything, the fat, the cartilage EVEYTHING. Because it's usually that good. At Delmonico's, I left half the plate. My advice, save your money for a better steakhouse. This one is overrated.",

We tried to get dinner reservations at The Cut restaurant since we heard good reviews however we were unable to because of the short notice. Delmonico was our second choice. As we walked in we were greeted kindly by the hostess who was nice enough to take a couple pictures of us before we sat down. This restaurant as a team of different individuals who will make your dining experience top notch. First off they have Sommelier who came right over to help us with our wine selection based on our likes. We order a bottle of Keever which is a red Cabernet. The food was exceptional and well presented. Just a little side not if you order the filet mignonette medium rare is more on the rare side. But I have to say the best part was taking our wine bottle to go! My boyfriend was embarrassed that I asked but I didn't have the heart to let good wine go to waste. I asked the waitress if they had \"to go cups\" and they brought out special wine glasses from the hotel which we were allowed to take outside the restaurant.   *** Don't let the lack of plain or non decor fool you they just want you to focus on the food!",

As a table, we shared the BBQ shrimp (which was just the right hit of smokey and sweet), Truffle and Parm Potato Chips (uberly addictive) and the lettuce wedge salad.  For my entree, I decided to get the Bone In Ribeye-the house specialty. It did not disappoint. It was quite a large piece of steak, but it didn't stop me from finishing all of it (that's not something I do very often). We split the creamed spinach and the creamed corn gratinee. The spinach was average but the creamed corn was vegetable candy.   We ended our meal with Emeril's infamous Banana Cream Pie. Holy moly. Sky high pie packed with bananas, caramel sauce, chocolate shavings, and whipped cream. Even though we were all full, we couldn't help but finish it.  Our waiter was extremely attentive. Service, overall, was phenomenal. When our steaks were ready, there was a server for each plate so we were presented our dishes at the same exact moment. Now that's service.  It goes without saying that this was pricey, even for Vegas standards, but you get what you pay for.   I highly recommend checking out Delmonico at least once.",

There were several items that looked delicious, and each of my choices was outstanding.   To start, the service was excellent. I had three servers, and my iced tea was always full. When I let the server know this was my first time visiting, he brought out a small plate with two bite-sized, yummy appetizers. I chose the prix fixe menu, starting with the beef carpaccio. The carpaccio with the crispy capers and garlic emulsion melted in my mouth.    For the main course, I had the recommended Emeril's BBQ salmon.  I chose medium rare, and it was cooked to perfection.  The sauce was great, and I loved the onions on top.  Desert was pecan pie with an incredible oatmeal shortbread crust.  I would probably order it without the whipped cream as it wasn't needed with the vanilla ice cream, but I wish I could have the pecan pie every day. Scrumptious!   It's not a cheap dinner, but the atmosphere, service and menu make it well worth it for a nice dinner out.",

All sides were really good, especially the creamed spinach: which actually tasted like spinach in cream sauce -- not the gloop one sometimes get. A special shout out to the sommelier, Dylan, who was engaging and informative and did not blink when we asked for a reasonably priced bottle of wine. The only glitch was we waited a bit longer than expected to have our drink orders taken when we first sat down. Overall a terrific meal.  <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tripadvisor.com%2FShowUserReviews-g45963-d422626-r504850640-Delmonico_Steakhouse-Las_Vegas_Nevada.html&s=f5ecdc9b6816e410b5a695dab7ff7be751ded52a38dabd82a3ba47d5ca6d2129\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">tripadvisor.com/ShowUser...</a>",

The food was good, but not even close to what I expect from the price range and names associated with this place. It certainly wasn't bad, but the steaks left a lot to be deserved in my humble opinion.  Next time, I'll probably pass this one and try one of the MANY other restaurants in Vegas.",

Both times i ordered the bone-in rib eye, and both times it was pretty good.  This latest time i ordered Medium-Rare, but it was definitely more on the medium side.  I should have been more upset it wasn't cooked exactly how i wanted it, but it was still good.    For dessert, i was pretty excited to try the Banana Cream Pie, but it was pretty average.  It had  A LOT of bananas and didn't really blow me away with flavor.   It was like eating a big banana with whip cream.  I probably wouldn't get it again.    The service was pretty good, but i wish they didn't sit us right next to the kitchen entrance.  It gets annoying to have people constantly walking by you with food and dishes.",

    "text": "Good but not great high-end steakhouse in Palazzo. Portions are generous and service is outstanding. My much-anticipated bone-in ribeye was bronto-sized and had plenty of juices despite being slightly over cooked and not aggressive enough on the seasoning for my taste. Make sure and order a more mellow red with these steaks - we got too intense with a spicy Zinfandel and it made the steak feel a little bland.   Those truffle oil potato chips are amazing! A must-have! And the potato au gratin and garlic sauteed mushrooms all served to compliment the steak as a team.   BBQ shrimp have a nice smokey sauce. Again, not as creole as you might think, but still nicely flavored.   Table-side Caesar salad prep is a great show, but in keeping with the trend, the salad itself doesn't have as much flavor as the presentation does.   The wine list was outstanding and affordable. Many wonderful options even for under $100. In fact, overall the entire menu is reasonably priced considering you're in Vegas at a famous chef's restaurant.   And the service was very good.   The food itself just isn't as excellent as it needs to be to try and compete with the heavy hitters like Prime and Cut. Or it wasn't this night.",

The French style of serving is charming, as always, and the management at this location were eager to please.  We felt a bit rushed at the beginning when our salads arrived seemingly almost immediately after we ordered, but they slowed the pace at our request so that we could savor the experience.  Neither of us were disappointed in our food, and the dessert was quite good.  The barbeque shrimp, if you've never had it, is definitely worth ordering.  But nothing left us talking about it afterword...   While Delmonico is not going to leave you hungry, it may not leave you marveling, either.",

You cannot go wrong with anything you order.  For dessert, the key lime pie is a MUST!  I don't like key lime pie but there's is creamy and delicious with none of that fake lime taste.

Yes this place is on the pricier side, yes the portions are huge, and yes its an upscale place. But you pay to play in Vegas so that is exactly what you receive here. The service was nothing but superb! It didn't matter if you're a big wig celeb, or just a family for wkend trip they treated every patron with the exact same excellent service.   The menu is pretty much full of steaks or some selections of pasta and seafood. Pretty much all items are ordered Al a carte in addition to your entree selection. The majority of us had the highly recommended bone in rib eye. OMG you will know with your first bite why this aged piece of steak is $52! It literally melts like butter in your mouth! The seasoning was spot on with that perfect caramelized crust. I would definitely recommend the rib eye if this is your first time here!   The must have side dish is the Creamed Corn Gratinee: This has the consistency of cream of corn yet has the crusty top of your usual gratins. It's has a delicious sweet yet savory flavor profile that just makes you wanna come back for seconds. The only negative is its $11 for that little dish. But again you pay for the quality instead of quantity here.  The next must have dessert is the banana cream pie! It's quite literally 8 layers of banana slices staked high! This reminds you exactly of what a banana cream pie your grandma used to make at home tastes!  This is quite the perfect way to finish off your meal or share with a date/friends.   We will definitely be visiting again on your next Vegas trip. But yes you'll need to save up for this one as your wallet may cry once you see the bill!",

Our wait staff was also friendly, but for some reason the warmth and good feeling I'm used to getting at steakhouses of this caliber was missing. Despite great reviews, I was moderately impressed. The wine list was extensive and had great choices. As an appetizer we were offered a mushroom dumpling that tasted fantastic. The downside was, it was a bit cold on the inside. The popovers also had lots of raving reviews but again, I wasn't impressed and they were also a bit cold. A tableside Caesar salad was our choice of vegetable. It was tasty, but about one notch above mediocre. We both ordered the filet mignon, medium rare, and were very happy with that cut. The flavor was spectacular and cooked to perfection. The grits with cheese and bacon, I was supremely unhappy with. My better half enjoyed them but I just did not care for the way they tasted. Too much like corn and they were not smooth at all. As a birthday treat, I was presented with a scoop of pumpkin ice cream that tasted very..... pumpkin-y. It wasn't bad but I couldn't finish it. The saving grace of the meal, besides the steak, was the caramel butter cake. Oh my word I couldn't eat it fast enough. I am not even a caramel fan but THAT was a warm and delicious dessert. I would return just for that alone. All in all, this wasn't a bad restaurant. It just doesn't creep to the top of the list of eateries I'd frequent if I'm searching out a steakhouse.",

You do have 2 servers, and they pay attention to every little detail, which is great. I mean I was only thinking that i needed another iced tea, and before I could signal for one, the server had one ready for me. Great!!!  However, I got the feeling everyone was trying a little to hard, I could tell only because everyone was so nervous and stumbling either over their words or the presentation of the food.   Food wise, the food was GREAT! The steak was literally falling apart, I didn't even have to use any force at all to cut my filet. It was like thick beef jerky, if you can imagine that!!!

Our waters was filled without asking, food came in steady stream, they checked on us consistently but not to the point where it gets uncomfortable.  We had the tiger shrimp with avocado and chicken gumbo as appetizers.  The shrimp was so good, super sweet and fresh.  Chicken gumbo was good too and I'm not even a gumbo type of person.    My SO and I both had the Prime Burger as our main course, and wow the burger was huge!  My SO is a pretty big eater and he could only finish 2/3 of the burger.  I had half of mine left over, I desperately wanted to finish it though.  The burgers were very rich, meaty, and just everything that a good burger should be.   I didn't give this place a 4 star because of our short trip to vegas we couldn't go back to eat dinner, but we'll be back soon and hopefully I can give this place a 5 star.",

Too bad I stuffed myself during brunch at Bouchon, I really wanted to try more at Delmonico.  + easy to make reservations via <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FOpentable.com&s=e2215de09505b8fbf3a047b68af38708cbc8b52c843ab34faaecc46b3704d557\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Opentable.com</a> (in fact I changed my reservation easily via smartphone) + great location in the Venetian/Palazzo restaurant row; close to multiple show theaters +/- huge restaurant (didn't notice from outside but there's a lot of tables) - sitting by the kitchen; another group asked to be moved too because the bus boys run in and out of there like their shoes were on fire, it was kind of nerve-wrecking to watch them - the place wasn't 100% packed even though it was Christmas so I don't understand why the wait service was meh (no butter, no bread until after appetizers, slow to refill water, etc.) + waiter hadn't come back to take our order and a manger (or whatever the guys in the suit vs. the aprons are called) stepped in + we ordered the Chateaubriand $105 (for 2) for the 3 of us (\"no, it's not frowned upon\" haha) +/- the sides that came w/ the meat was okay (the mashed potatoes wasn't as bad as everyone says and the asparagus was so forced - it's not even in season right now) +/- Traditional New Orleans Gumbo $10 was not worth it - it was decent but I wouldn't order it again or recommend it to anyone (and whats up with serving it in a small sauce pan on the bowl, then pouring it into the bowl - does that mean that pan was just on the stove top aka dirty? and I didn't even get a chance to pick out all the green onion before it got mixed in, sigh) + Vine-Ripened Heirloom Tomato Salad $17- pricey but it was tasty and this is coming from someone that doesn't like tomato unless it's in salsa form + tasty wine and hefty wine BINDER ;-)  We debated ordering a dessert but none of it sounded appetizing. If you can get it at the buffet, save the calories.  I may come back to try some more stuff but there are so many more restaurants I need to try the next time I'm back in Vegas.",

My prime rib-eye steak was cooked perfectly (mid-rare), seasoning was spot on and your steak wont be distracted by a pool of butter. Try topping it with a generous piece of Foie Gras if you don't mind the occasional stoppage of the heart.  Unlike alot of other steakhouse where you feel cramped, and surrounded by ear deafening drunks, at Delmonico the ceiling is high, tables are placed with room to run around (not recommended). And you have ample room to stretch your stomach and legs while not eavesdropping on the other table's encounter with \"girls directly to your room\".  I would love to give Delmonico 5-stars, however, their sides had a lackluster performance. A little adventure wouldn't hurt, it is Vegas afterall.  So my quest continues with N9NE and Stripsteak coming up in a month. Good Luck to me!",

Thumbs up.  I really wasn't paying attention to what everyone else was ordering so I'll just list what we got..  Crab Cakes Rib Eye Steak  Shrimp Fettucinni with Sausages Steamed Broccoli ($10 for a small bowl.. I really wanted to go to the Frozen isle and buy one for $1.50) haha Orange Zest Cheesecake (My Fav)  Everything came out to $180 but this included tax and gratuity. The food was delicious, especially the steak. Not overcooked or too much seasoning. It was just right. For the pasta they serve large portions of the shrimp. Not the baby shrimp you have to go digging for. Ah ha and the crab cake was very good! I don't deal with that imitation crab. Yuck! It was not a huge portion but enough to make me happy. I heart the Cheesecake! It's a must! You can definately taste the Orange zest, which makes it original for your typical strawberry..etc..etc  The service was great. Why 4 stars instead of 5? Because they wouldn't allow us to sing Happy Birthday in the restaurant. Geeze are there any exceptions?  Overall, I would highly recommend this place. Scrumdelumcious!",

We splurged (I rarely order dessert) and shared a piece of chocolate cake.  Everyone was pleasant but with an air of regal you would expect in an upscale restaurant.

I think the waiter said that the ribeye was a solid 19 ounce steak while the filet was 9 ounces so you can see the meat difference.  Our server told us that they put a rub on the steak, the steak is carefully aged as well, and cook it with butter so it comes out with a nice char. Steaks were cooked perfectly and I like my steaks medium rare.  We also paired it with a nice Sequoia Grove Cabernet Sauvignon 2006.  The appetizers that we had were the truffle oil chips, creamed corn and sauteed mushrooms. The truffle and parmesan chips are a must to get...they're heavily!!! (couldn't taste the parmesan...even though I dislike cheese).  It's a must try steak house if you're ever in Las Vegas for a great meal!!!",

The times between our bbq shrimp appetizer, plump and flavorful, the salad, and our meats were appropriate. My rack of lamb (med-rare) was cooked to perfection, juicy and tasty.

    "text": "Went here with some friends while my husband and I were having our couple's shower in Vegas prior to our wedding. His best man raved about the restaurant, so we decided to give it a go.  We made a reservation for the first seating, but they weren't quite ready for us when we got there, so we sat in the bar area and ordered a couple of drinks. I got a very good pino noir, though I can't recall where it was from.  When it was time to be seated, we were escorted to our table through a line of wait staff. Honestly, it was a bit uncomfortable walking through all those people. Once we got to our table, our server came over and gave us menus. Both the server and her assistant were pleasant enough, though I don't know I would go as far as saying there were \"friendly.\"  We all ordered our starters and make courses, plus a couple of sides. I got the lobster bisque, which I wasn't all that impressed with. I had better lobster bisque on cruise ship. It was a bit salty and the way they presented it was a bit tacky, in my opinion.  When the entrees came, everything was fine. The steak was good, but I don't know that I would ever pay $50+ for it again. I asked for medium, and I got medium rare. Which was fine for me, but one of my friends had the same problem, and it kinda grossed her out. So she had to send it back. The server got the problem fixed very quickly, and it was perfect the second time around.  I did like that they came with some sauces. The Bearnaise was very good and my husband devoured the peppercorn sauces. The sides were all good, but not as big as we had anticipated. Our waiter said they should feed 3-4 people. However, when you have two 250+ pound guys with you, it was not enough.  The desserts were FANTASTIC. I had the creme brule, which was perfect. Soft and creamy, with a yummy hard shell on the top. I would order that again in a heart beat. And we all felt the deserts were very reasonably priced for what we received. Definitely big enough for 2 people to share.  Overall, 3 starts. Everything was good and probably would have gotten 4 stars, if not for the price of everything. When you pay that much for food, you expect to be wowed. And we just weren't.

    "text": "Delmonico's is an institution - but it's by no means a \"5-Star\" steakhouse.  Historically, it was one of the first really credible celebrity chef steakhouses in Vegas - despite the fact that Emeril Lagasse really wasn't the founder of the original Delmonico's of New Orleans.  BAD NEWS:  NOT UP TO PAR WITH THE NEW ORLEANS ORIGINAL Patterned after the original which resides in New Orleans, Delmonico's serves delicious, beefy steaks with services & class befitting a Louisiana.  For those of you who've been to the New Orleans steakhouse, let me assure you that like the Vega rendition of \"Commander's Palace\", you will NOT get the same quality at the Vegas \"Delmonico's\".    And that's a shame because to this day, one of the top 3 steaks I've ever eaten was at the New Orleans' Delmonico's... not the Vegas location.  GOOD NEWS:  IT'S STILL A GOOD PLACE FOR STEAKS But I don't think you'll leave terribly disappointed.  Everything from the cigars to the baked potato to the crab legs and lobster tails to the steaks themselves - it's all still pretty good.  (More on the beef later.)  Items are always served hot, and plates are served in synchronicity to all guests with multiple waiters.  The wine list is the size of Godzilla and their humidor has a colossal assortment of cigars that would make Bill Clinton giddy.  AND WHAT ABOUT THE STEAKS, SERVICE, ETC.? Here's the thing:  They prepare it correctly every time and their service is their hallmark.  However when it comes to different categories (Flavor, service, decor) it kinda varies on how they rank: 1) FLAVOR I have to hand it to Envy the Steakhouse over Delmonico's and I think Charlie Palmer's outdoes it as well in most aspects.  Michael Mina's StripSteak probably outdoes it for at least flavor.  Meanwhile Craftsteak has consistently softer, more buttery servings of the same cuts.  It's probably a close tie with PRIME Steakhouse at the Bellagio.   ...but it beats going to CUT, Carnevino, N9NE Steakhouse, & Circus Circus Steakhouse in my experience.   2) SERVICE If you're looking for prompt service with an attention to detail, it's hard to beat Delmonico's.  That's something they have down really well.  Only Envy & Charlie Palmer's probably rival it and Envy only gets the nod because there's rarely many people there so service is often 1 to 1.  Everyone else kinda pales in comparison - especially CUT & StripSteak where I've consistently gotten sketchy service.  I strongly suspect that my service would have been 3x better had I had my host make the reservation instead of calling it in myself. 3) DECOR It's darker, candlelit ambiance is romantic but not very illustrious compared to the views of PRIME or the decor of Carnevino.  Most steakhouses I've noticed are pretty bland and non-descript in general (N9NE is utterly weird - what with all the white walls and junk) though so I'm not sure this is really a big point.    CONCLUSION: Delmonico's, while it's lost some luster compared to some of the other big name talents in the Vegas steak industry, still holds its own amongst the heavyweights.  Kind of a reasonably reliable, middle of the pack, horse that you can depend on for a decent - but pricey - meal.  3 1/2-stars... rounded up, as a tip of the hat to tradition.  ----------------- INSIDER'S TIP:  GETTING INTO DELMONICO'S WITHOUT A RESERVATION Very simple:  $50 to the maitre d' will quietly grease your way from having a cocktail at the bar to a table with immediate service usually within 60 seconds - no questions asked.  You'll either need to reach over registration to pass the bill to him/her or call him/her around to shake his hand and simply mention that you appreciate their hard work getting you a table.   ...In general, tips really work at Delmonico's in all aspects of the restaurant.  From the wait staff to the bartender to the resident sommelier.  I've pulled this more than a dozen times without fail with the maitre d' during booked solid conventions from CES recently to going back to the COMDEX days.   ...This may seem obvious to some, but the key is that the tip angle on 'immediate seating' only works in places where tables are reserved for hotel VIPs.  (For example, Nobu's really has no such seating other than \"next table available\")",

The food was good at times, not so great at other times, but the one thing that was constant was the excellent service.    Delmonico's continues that tradition.  The service is excellent.  At times, it's a little too friendly, but attentive and not overbearing.  Food came out at a very good pace, allowing for long conversations without interruption.  And the decor is so understated and clean.  It really is a nice change from all of the typical Vegas restaurants with loud lighting and faux-glam decor.  Because my girlfriend was so eager to try Emeril's food (she's a big fan), we started off with some classics - barbecued shrimp (New Orleans style) and shrimp cocktail with remoulade sauce.  The lunch menu usually has shrimp remoulade over fried green tomatoes.  However, it wasn't on the menu and I really wanted my girlfriend to try it.  The waiter was nice enough to accommodate my request, learned they had some prepared and served it with the shrimp cocktail.  To drink, she ordered a glass of Loosen Bros.  \"Dr. L Estate\" Riesling and I ordered a glass of Laurent Perrier NV Champagne.   The Riesling was recommended by the Asst. Sommelier.  The waiter initially recommended an Australian white blend.  But to me, it didn't seem like the best match with the barbecued shrimp because it lacked the acidity to cut the richness of the dish.  When I commented to the Sommelier that I thought the Australian white had Viognier in it, he said it definitely did.  As we talked more, he said the Riesling was a \"perfect match\" for the barbecued shrimp.  You know what?  It was.  My girlfriend wolfed down half of the barbecued shrimp, taking a sip of the Riesling with each bite.  She even raved - it was a perfect match.  And she also loved the remoulade.  The barbecued shrimp were cooked well, I noticed one of the shrimp I had was a little tough, but the remaining shrimp were plump and juicy.  The shrimp cocktail was great.  Cold, large shrimp, moist, juicy and firm.  They were perfect with the remoulade sauce.  From there, we split the bone-in rib eye which was cooked ABSOFRIGGINLUTELY PERFECTLY MED-RARE TO MED.  It wasn't charred, but had that crunch of a good high-temp seared steak.  The twice baked potato with bacon and cheese was sinfully great.  The asparagus was sauteed with garlic and shallots, cooked perfectly through with still a slight crunch.  We shared a half bottle of 2003 Pine Ridge Crimson Creek Merlot which was a good match for the steak.  It had good balance, acidity, but enough soft fruit to please my girlfriend, who doesn't like tannic wines.  Dessert was banana cream pie for her, pecan pie for me.  Both were excellent.  The banana cream pie wasn't as sweet as expected, which made it even more easy to eat.  She ordered an espresso martini made with espresso (not the flavored vodka), I ordered a glass of 2003 Carmes de Rieussec Sauternes and finished with a cup of chicory coffee to finish.  Was it inexpensive? Of course not.  It was quite expensive.  But for the excellent quality of food (far, far, far better than Gallagher's and probably the second best only to Bouchon of the restaurants I've eaten at in Vegas) and the best service I've had in Vegas (yes, better than Bouchon), it was worth it.    Why 5 stars?  Because everything went right.  Was the service perfect? Almost.  Was the food perfect?  Almost.  Were the drinks perfect?  Almost.  Adding that all together with the right person I wanted to share the evening with, it was perfect.  (Although I didn't ever finish my French Laundry review, that place IS nearly perfect with whoever you go with.  It is still to this day, the best eating experience I have ever had and I've had the fortune of going there 3 times now.)  Now if I could only remember the name of the Asst. Sommelier, I would give him a shout out here.    I am once again a fan of Emeril.  But please, no \"BAM.\"",

    "text": "I've never had a meal experience like what I had at Delmonico's. Me and a buddy were in Vegas for the first time and decided we wanted to go out for a good steak dinner. I asked for recommendations from people and settled on Delmonico's. I made reservations the Monday before the Thursday we went to dinner. I checked out the menu ahead of time and was not surprised to see the pretty high prices., I was confident though that we were gonna get what we paid for.  We arrived about 45 minutes before the reservation time and had a couple beers in the lounge. $6 for a Bud Light was pretty reasonable for this atmosphere. We were seated promptly at 7 and that's where things got impressive. The dining area is secluded, you have no idea you are in a casino, which is great. We were greeted by one of our 3 waiters and offered the wine menu. Neither of us drink wine, but I could tell the selection was awesome.  We ordered the truffle and Parmesan potato chips and bowls of the gumbo. Both were excellent, Emeril knows gumbo. I ordered the bone-in ribeye and my buddy got the filet. We also got the potato gratin and a twice baked potato. The sides are ala carte and family style. They were some of the best potatoes we had ever had. As for the steaks, they were both the greatest steaks we had ever had! No sauce is necessary for these babies. After dinner I had the banana cream pie, which was exceptional. My buddy had the cheesecake and said it was awesome.  Overall I can not speak highly enough of the dining experie nce at Delmonico's. The professional staff, excellent atmosphere, and amazing food make Delmonico's a place I will go to again.",

My wife's filet was tasty and what one would expect from a restaurant of this caliber. Unfortunately, my ribeye was tough and full of fat. I would say about half of it was edible. With al of the choices to enjoy a quality steak in Vegas, ignore the hype and go somewhere else.",

    "text": "My group and I were congregating outside in the bar area prior to our reservation and I was called by name to be seated which was very nice.  The dining room is actually more like one large hall way with two adjoining rooms.  You get about 2-3 waiters per table and they offer very good and attentive service overall.  So anyways on to the food review.  I ended up ordering the tuna/salmon tartare appetizer and the bone-in rib steak medium rare.  The Tuna and salmon both were very tasty but the portion was rather small.  For $18, I would expect a little bit more.  Now on to the reason why we dined here....my steak came out and it looked giant.  The overall taste of the meat was only decent at best.  I was really expecting a more flavorful piece of meat.  Maybe they forgot to season it or just didn't put enough of emeril's spice?  I could tell though the meat quality was very, very good.  They advertise wet-age steaks, but I much prefer dry-aged steaks.  Too bad my steak was only just okay and for $52 I didn't feel ripped off but more disappointed.  I thought about ordering the bone-in NY strip and regret it now.  I'd sacrifice little fat and marbling for some more flavor. The side dishes that our group shared were also just okay, nothing spectacular but not bad either.",

My girlfriend and I started with the caesar salad which was just wonderful, great flavor and presentation.  We then both went with the steak sandwich with truffle oil fries.  The steak sandwich though not huge was extremely delicious and I mean EXTREMELY delicious.  Everything that went into it was perfect, the spinach, the mushrooms, the grilled chibata, the horseradish mayo, and the wonderful juicy perfectly cooked steak.  It is a bit pricey at $18, but definitely worth the price in my opinion.  The fries weren't anything special and were a bit over cooked.  The setting was nice, but the restaurant was empty and all the guests dining were confined to the front dining room.  Overall great meal, and I will be a repeat customer when back in town.",

Went with a group of 9 and ordered the \"surf and turf\" consisting of the ribeye and a seafood mashed potato combo.  The good - Mashed potatoes were excellent, generous lump seafood, very tasty.  Side dishes also were excellent.  The disappointing - The ribeye.  Ordered it medium rare, as did my friend next to me.  Both of our steaks were probably cooked closer to medium, neither was juicy or tender, there seemed to be no marbled fat content at all, and the texture was almost grainy.  I'll eat everything from In N Out to more foodie type establishments, always with a smile on my face, but this experience was a bit of a shock to me.  I've had ribeyes for 1/3 the price but infinitely better.    Weird.  But I think I'd rather try somewhere else as I wouldn't want a repeat experience at that price point.",

    "text": "This is not my first time at Delmonico. I was in Vegas a few years ago on business (again) and had a group dinner (10-12 people) here. I did not make the reservation but the person who did somehow got us the chef's table. If you are not familar...the chef's table is it's own room separate but right next to the kitchen. Because the room is made up of clear glass...we could see right into the kitchen and watch our meals being made. It was very cool. We did the tasting menu. It was all great and the portions were so large that by round 4 I was uncomfortably full...and still had the steak course to go!   I came back for dinner last week with some friends for dinner. No chef's table this time...sat in the regular ole dining area. Service was pretty good and I thought the food delivered (although my initial experience was a bit more memorable). We had the calamari with an live tapenade and also the BBQ shrimp. I thought the calamari was good, not spectacular (this would not have been my first choice as an app but I wasn't the only one at dinner). I thought the BBQ shrimp was delicious and had great flavor, cooked perfectly. Split a blue cheese wedge - can't go wrong there. I had the mixed grill special which came with a piece of pork tenderloin, slab of bacon & a piece of andouille sausage all served over greens and andouille grits. Delicous! The andouille sausage was the star of the plate as far as I'm concerned. My friend had a ribeye and a cheddar twice baked potato and enjoyed it. Someone else got the pork tenderloin off the regular menu which came with grits, greens & cornbread pancakes (which were tasty). All of us enjoyed our meals. I think it's a nice little \"splurge\" for dinner.   I do agree with another reviewer who said that the ambience is nothign special (unless you get the chef's table of course) and that the steak selection was nothing different - same cuts of meat as other fine steak houses. I didn't see that \"wow\" factor onthe menu...which is why I ordered one of the specials.",

    "text": "I know I know.  The veg is only giving 2 stars to the steakhouse.  I wanted to like it, I did.  On our girls-weekend to Vegas, one gal requested at least one nice steak dinner.  So we did some research and ended up here.  Seated promptly at our reservation time on a Friday night after sitting only a few minutes in their version of a waiting room. As others have mentioned, when you order a steak ... that's what you get.  Not a piece of parsley to garnish, nothin' else is on that plate.  Our lil steak girl said her $45 steak was .... ok.  But, and I quote, she'd had a steak with more flavor at a certain Aussie steak chain.  Girl who ordered the chicken dish loved it and said it was worth the money.  The $9 side of mashed potatoes was yummy.  Little veg here ordered their vegetable plate (not on the menu, but when I asked what was available, our waiter offered this) and it cost me $30.  For grilled veggies - carrots, two types of onion, asparagus, and .... something else.  Not even squash!  A squash ravioli was on the menu, but not being served that night. Loud, no bathroom inside (have to walk around the corner in the casino), and there was NO decor to the place.  Maybe that's a style, but it ain't mine. The wine list is waaay extensive, almost to a fault. Service was overwhelming in that we had four separate waiters, but chaotic.  And it was 40 minutes from ordering to getting our food. Last complaint - if you have a nice restaurant, insist on some kind of basic dresscode.  I don't want to have spent time looking nice and then sit next to a table full of rednecks in Tasmanian Devil cartoon shirts. Sorry, but it isn't worth the money for herbivores or carnivores.",

    "text": "I was in Las Vegas with my fiance while he was attending a wireless convention for his company.  I asked a friend to recommend a good restaurant to go to while we were there.  From his short list of about 5, we chose Delmonico's.  Delmonico's is at the Venetian in the Palazzo with about 50 other shops & restaurants.  Attire was business casual.  The dining room was dimly lit and elegant.  They treat you with table side service, and very personal attention from no less than 3 attendants.  The wine list was impressive and started out with Kevin's picks (the sommelier).  I noticed the by the glass section only had about 5 different wines on it. Apparently this wasn't a by the glass kind of place!  Their wine list also boasted many 'cult' wines like Screaming Eagle and Harlan.  Although Twomey Merlot was on the list, we soon found that they had sold out already.  Our maitre d', Lamont, said he was a very big fan and recommended it frequently.  Kevin came by our table to meet us and said he wasn't aware they were out of the Merlot and that he would be ordering more that week.  Delmonico's is a classic American steakhouse with Creole influences.  I couldn't decide between the crab cake, the ahi tuna & salmon tartare & the New Orleans BBQ shrimp so our waiter suggested the shrimp; said it was their signature starter and I was so glad he did.  It was amazing! I also had the filet. It was cooked perfectly, creole seasoned, medium rare (the color was consistently the same shade through the entire cut) and it melted like butter in your mouth. The service was exquisite.  There was a maitre d' & a waiter for every 3 tables and we were given a lot of attention.  For dessert, I had chocolate brioche bread pudding with Hawaiian vintage chocolate ice cream & fudge. When our server came back to check on us, I thought maybe I had a look of sheer ecstasy on my face, but he had said he knew how good  it was and wanted to make sure I was enjoying it as much as he does.  We surprised Lamont by telling him we were leaving him wine; he thanked us for our generosity.  I am giving Delmonico's 5 stars, each of which I feel they are very worthy of.  Dining here was not cheap, or even close to being on budget, ($450 for 2 people) but it was fantastic.",

On the other hand, this is one of the best restaurants I have been to in Vegas and would definitely give it two thumbs up and recommend it to those staying at the Venetian.",

Whatever the case that shouldn't matter because I was there for the RIB EYE!!!  Disappointing... hardly marbled... flavorful yes, but tough enough where I couldn't enjoy every bite.  My pallet favors texture over flavor and although my wife felt the steaks were flavorful, in my opinion the toughness completely buries any goodness from the flavor.  What really lowers the score for Delmonico is the sheer fact that it's surrounded by so many other steak houses, I mean it's Vegas after all!! Because of this, I don't see myself EVER coming back",

    "text": "Delmonico is a fraction of what it once was. Back about 10+ years ago, I remember Emerill's hot steak and seafood restaurant having excellent steak, tasty gumbo and wonderful desserts.   The ambiance and service were excellent. We started with the gumbo which was very bland and toned down from the original. The barbeque shrimp were ok, but nothing to write home about. For dessert, the banana creme pie was still excellent.  I remember Delmonico as a solid 4 star steak spot, and wonder what has happened. It's very sad to see this happen to what used to be one of my favorites.",

The Ahi Tuna Tartar was pretty good, but not a must get.  My friend and I shared the Chateaubriand filet, which was perfectly done and delicious.  Highly recommended!    And, as icing on the cake, they have an incredible scotch list.    They are able to accommodate large groups, which is nice - but even with a reservation, our wait was an hour, which is unacceptable - minus one star.  I've grown to like Vegas more and more as I've learned that they have something for everyone - great food, shows, clubs, gambling, outdoor activities, pools, shopping, etc.  Delmonico is a great addition to the already outstanding food selection in Vegas.",

Located in restaurant row in the Venetian, this place is an Emeril restaurant that features steaks and sides of high quality.    A few of my party actually shared the rib eye because it was a really bit cut of meat.  That combined with the great sides made a wonderful meal.  Service was impeccable as our waiter and other staff were engaged and always on top of what we needed.  For sides, I'd suggest the grits and bacon.  I ate the whole side dish and barely shared with others.  The creamed corn was surprisingly good and the brussels were also really good.  For dessert, we had the strawberry shortcake which came in a jar which was terribly good.  We also had the chocolate cake and key lime pie.  I didn't try too much of that as I was stuck digging my spoon in the strawberry shortcake.   For a great balance of food and service, I highly recommend.",

If you feel like the special rub, cooked to perfection steak... this is the place.   My filet was cooked to perfection.  It would come off the fork and knife like butter. The juices running down the plate, the char on the steak glowing in my face.   For fans of rib eye, this is the place (get the bone in) I know you may not want to do the work, but its fantastic.  For the filet eaters like me, this is the place.  The tableside caesar was perfect.  The dressing was spot on, with anchovies (if requested) just the right amount of cheese, and other ingredients.  Its a do it.  I stayed away from the potatoes, but had the creamed corn and spinach and good grief, the night kept getting better and better.  The gran finale, was the biggest piece of banana cream pie I have ever had. This is no ordinary banana cream pie.  This is over 5 layers of pure banana pieces baked with the best crust and cream you have ever had in your life.  Even if you decide to dine somewhere else (which I disagree with) go for the dessert. You will leave Las Vegas with a smile on your face, ready to gamble and hit the night  on the town.",

We were a party of 6 and truth be told we were running on fumes from the prior evenings festivities (how strange...in vegas??) so this review is based on our less than average appetites. Although we did order a lot more than we could manage to eat.  Their most popular steak is probably the bone in rib-eye and it's a whopping 16 ounces (without bone)...quite hefty and although the steak was cooked to perfection it was definitely under seasoned. It also seemed mine had a bit more fat than usual which is as we know is where all the flavour is but it seemed perhaps a bit too much. All the sides were awesome and their meant to be shared family style... definitely try the garlic mushrooms!  Service was top notch...not in your face but always there making sure your wine is topped off and full of suggestions when you need.  I've been to STK in Vegas and if you're looking for the more swank place you might want to hit that up but for a more authentic steakhouse experience I'd definitely recommend Delmonico...",

It was heavily coated in honey and I didn't enjoy it. The bone-in ribeye was delicious and cooked to perfection as was the pecan pie.   Delmonico has a great wine list and we ordered a nice bottle that complimented all of our meals and then we ended with a nice 40 year tawny port and coffee.   Someone in my group had ordered a filet cooked medium and if was more medium-rare than medium.   I would return here but it's not a place that I would make a regular for me when I go to Vegas.",

Once we were seated though, the service was pretty good, as well as the setting.  It was too loud as far as ambiance goes, but it wasn't too invasive.    We grabbed the Stuffed Pork Trotter, which by itself could be an entree as opposed to the appetizer.  After we were \"stuffed\" with the pork trotter, we proceeded on to the main course.  I grabbed the boneless rib-eye, which was very intimidating.  I also shared some sides of spinach and mashed potatoes.  All of the main entree items were excellent, though I was too full to finish the rib-eye.  This place is probably one of the better steakhouses I've been to in a long while, despite the prices, which I was fine with paying.  Bring an empty stomach, but a full wallet.",

    "text": "Great steak but disappointing service for the price.  Went here for a friend's bachelor party.  We all got bone-in ribeyes medium rare (of course) with multiple sides and starters.  Unfortunately, mine came out clearly at medium well.  Which would be fine if I were not paying 50+ dollars to enjoy the wonderful dry-aged (etc., etc.) beef.  The steak still tasted good but not as great as it could have been.  I brought this to the attention of the waiter, who offered to bring me a new steak, but I did not wish to wait 15 minutes while my friends ate.  At the end of the meal, the waiter offered a free desert to make up for the steak, but we were all too full to enjoy one, so I declined.  No other offers were made to compensate for the overcooked steak (could have made any one of the drinks, appetizers or sides we ordered) and when the check arrived, the waiter had mistakenly added an extra bottle of wine to the tab (when brought to his attention, he removed it of course).  I know these are minor complaints, but having waited tables at much cheaper restaurants, I have found a way to make it up to a customer when mistakes were made.  I expect at least the same when a table is spending 400 dollars in your restaurant.  So all in all, the food was great, service good, but not up to par for the money you will spend.",

    "text": "For me to give this place 3 stars takes complete honesty from me and also shows my disappointment.  I wanted so much to love this place, to crown it, (it wasn't what I thought it was!), to walk out wholly satisfied in the knowledge that I will not have a better steak.  Dining here was supposed to be one of the cornerstones of this Vegas trip, \"remember the time we ate at Delmonico's...\" type thing.  The 3 stars is my confession to myself, this place was not worth the price.  I'm no lover of Cajun food, or spices or anything, and the only thing I know about Emeril is he says \"BAM!\" a lot and the character Elzar on Futurama is a direct parody of him.  I've got no urge to try any more of his food though.  We ate here the evening of the Final Four, had an early reservation and was seated promptly in a fairly quiet room.  Good corner location where we could look out at everything around us but not have people walk by us.  The decor was not of any note...   We started with the cocktail shrimp with crackers... very odd.  I've been eating a lot of shrimp lately, and there was nothing special about these.  The sauce was a bit spicier than others, so decent.  I pushed my girlfriend to try the kobe...  while I stuck with my old standby of NY.  The bread was nothing special as well.  My sides were pretty average... I enjoyed my girlfriend's fried scallops though.  The vegetables and potatoes are just complements to the meal though.  The kobe steak came all sliced up and ready to go... It wasn't the mind blowing experience with kobe that I hoped it would be.  I could see the disappointment on my gf's face as she chewed on it.  On the plus side, the kobe sirloin meal came with the sides so thats a few bucks saved.  And sadly, thats the plus side of it.    My steak was of a fairly average size, maybe an inch thick, bone-in and perhaps 16 ounces.  I ordered it medium... which the waiter confirmed would be pink throughout.  I waver between medium-rare and medium.. usually if a steak is bone-in I go medium.  Unfortunately, my steak was overcooked.  It got to that bastard style known as medium-well.  I kept hoping as I got closer to the bone it would pinken up, but no such luck.  I ate it happily as it was still a good steak, but I just couldn't shake the disappointment.  The seasoning used on it was decent and had some spice to it but no charm to it.  Part way through my meal I attempted to knife-lift a portion for the gf to try, and wound up dropping it on the table cloth leaving a huge outline of meat.  We laughed about it and both expected our waiter to say something, anything about it as he brushed it with the crumb brush.  Sigh, no such warmth here.  Service was efficient and not quite friendly.  I guess high end steakhouses cater to clients that would rather not have their imperfections pointed out.  One look at me would suggest I'm not the typical client, but no joke came from either our waiter or the assistant waiter.    After we perused the desert menu, I settled on the banana cream pie.  This was the best banana cream pie I've ever had.  It was beautifully presented, had fresh bananas, and was not too sweet.  This was the favorite part of the meal for me.  I doubt I'll ever have a better banana cream pite,  but I'll keep looking.  All in all, a decent meal but not worth the price.  Meal was ~$200 for 2, no drinks, nothing particularly noteworthy.  I doubt I'll ever go back on my own wallet.",

It did have  bland all white decor in the main dining that reminded me of 2001 a Space Odyssey 's Discovery One with  really dim lights. Good thing the steaks were from another universe also! It had to have been the largest ribeye I have ever ordered for one person, and It came with a slab of butter!  Really it needs more butter? It was well marbled, thick with a little char (key !),  and it had a wonderful juicy flavor. It  was extremely good as I was so full about 3/4 of the way through, but as in \"man vs food\" i trudged on ! I have to say it was a fantastic to eat, but i did feel like a hundred pounds heavier throughout the evening!

    "text": "I'm struggling to figure out why I am rating this four stars instead of five. I guess that five stars is perfection and nothing is perfect, right?   We (me, wife, and my parents) at here on Sunday, August 2, at 7:00. We reserved via OpenTable and were promptly seated in a very nice location. Even though the restaurant was busy the tables on either side of us were kept empty until we were leaving, which was a very nice touch. My wife and I, and my parents, were celebrating our wedding anniversaries, and I noted this with OpenTable. This was communicated to the restaurant and they treated us very nice.   The service was extremely good. Each table is assigned three people: a head waiter, an assistant waiter, and a buser. All were very polite and professional. The buser was a bit green but that is OK; her mistakes were very minor. The head waiter was exceptional - I don't remember his name and I feel bad for not being able to call him out and recognize him here. The second waiter was also very good; again, I forget her name.   Very good bread was brought to the table and a complimentary appetizer was served to us that consisted of a very yummy chicken salad. My wife and I ordered the table-side Caesar salad and it was worth the $30. The table-side preparation is neat to watch, and she did a great job with it. The entire salad is made from scratch at the table. This Caesar goes right to the top of my list as my very favorite Caesar and almost makes up for the beat-down I got at the Palazzo's craps table right before dinner. My dad ordered a shrimp cocktail that looked excellent.   My dad and I both had the boneless rib eye and my mom and wife split the filet. It was all good; in fact, I could have used a smaller steak. The waiter said it was 14-16 ounces but this was definitely bigger. For sides we ordered the asparagus, which I don't eat, and the small potatoes with garlic, which were very good.   I had a root beer float for dessert - I liked the fact that there were some old favorites on the dessert menu, including peach cobbler.   With two bottles of wine (at $65/bottle) we spent over $400 (before tip) on dinner but all agreed that it was money well spent.   About the only negative is the couple who brought a very small child (6 months?) into the restaurant with them. The baby wasn't doing well and cried somewhat - shame on the parents.",

John and his group were attentive without being snooty and overbearing.  we felt comfortable.  i don't think there was ever a moment when our glasses reached half empty glass before they addressed it.  any little crumbs on the table were quickly taken care of.  definitely the service I was expecting from a top notch Vegas establishment.  expect to spend about $100 / person.  everything is a la carte.  entrees were about $50, sides about $10, cocktails about $15 and wine $$$$.  huge portions.  if you had any food earlier in the day,  don't expect to finish your entree, especially if you order the bone rib steak.   enjoyed a delicious meal: - crabcake topped with fennel and tomatoes (very good!) - bone rib steak (lots of marbleization, good, but was not wowed) - parmesan fillet medallion (very good!) - parmesan truffle potato chips (soo bad, but ooh soo tasty) - asparagus (gotta have a veggie)",

I loved how the waiters and the chef that night wanted to listen to people's opinions of the dishes. Right when we arrived, they allowed us to sample an appetizer on the house, and the waiters asked for our opinion about it. It was a flaky chicken salad puff of some sort, and it was delicious! The side dishes I had were the mushrooms and asparagus. Scrumptious! As for the steak....SUPERB!  I had the steak in the bone (forgot the real name), and it was really good! My goodness! The environment is very dim but elegant. Fancy dining, for sure. I will always love that the waiters are wearing suits and always ask your opinion about every dish you try! They were even nice enough to give me a cute little chocolate dessert for my birthday for free! I love Delmonicos!",

The restaurant itself is not aesthetically appealing(drab lighting with white painted walls) and seating is not very private as the proximity of the tables are annoying.  I think the branding by Emeril has had a national appeal that people identify with and that's how his restaurants do so well but personally, I think all of his restaurant's food is mediocre at best with the exception of Commander's Palace in New Orleans.  Now don't get me totally wrong, the food isn't terrible as I still give this 3 stars but the whole experience here just won't knock your socks off.",

I was going to rate this restaurant four stars, but after reading a few other reviews, I dropped it down to three - we simply didn't have the same experience, which is frustrating.  We dined here three days ago, and the only thing I remember about it was the cost of the bill...and the potatoes gratin. Those were...amazing.  If you're staying at the Venetian/Palazzo, and don't wish to leave the property, by all means, go forth. But if you're looking for a True old school steakhouse experience, I'd say do some more research first.",

The steaks especially the prime bone-in rib eye, is dry aged properly on premises and done perfectly at the right temperature - it needs no improvement. Service is warm, friendly and unpretentious like you were at an old friend's place. I've been to other so-called superior steakhouses with snobby servers who just take away from an otherwise good experience. Delmonico knows its the dining experience that you remember and not exactly what you ate that made a difference.  I keep it simple and have a few sides (Apple cured kurubota bone-in BACON!) with the steak and maybe start off with the caesar salad prepared tableside. Root beer float is my favorite dessert but the Banana Cream Pie is worth trying too. There are plenty of hand crafted cocktails available on the drink menu for you to enjoy. Attire is business or smart casual (no sleeveless shirts but I think casual shorts are ok especially in the summer). You can find it in The Venetian Resort Hotel Casino and there is access from The Palazzo too!",

Our server Clint was the best!  He split the pours of the whiskeys we wanted to sample and even brought over the bottles so we could take a quick photo.

We had the German chocolate cake and the duck egg creme brulee for dessert. The German chocolate cake was pretty good, but the creme brulee was very good.

I ordered the Bone-in Ribeye this time believe its 20oz and my wife ordered the Seared Sea Scallops & Herb Gnocchi. I would have to say the Bone In Ribeye is now my FAVORITE steak to get here now. I ordered it medium rare. It so juicy, tender and flavors galore all up in your mouth lol! I pretty much smashed the whole steak and it didn't have a chance.

I wanted a side to compliment it and was told the roasted potatoes was better than the twice baked potatoes and was let down.  Their was mixed reviews at the table on their entrees but they all did agree the German chocolate cake was very dry this night. The banana pudding cake was big hit though.   I would come back and explore more of their menu.",

You can make reservations on Opentable.   The menu is slightly different for lunch and dinner with some items just being able to be ordered during the set time. For lunch I had the lobster roll to check out how they made this. The bread is unique and different from other lobster rolls I have tried. The I side had chunks of meaty lobster which was pretty delicious!   Friends all got different food and enjoyed their meals. Some ordered steak and some ordered lots of different appetizers as their main course. So you can pick and choose a variety of options!   Everything seems to be pretty tasty off the menu! Dinner seems a little bit on the busier side so don't forget to make reservations.   Tip: Loved the sides and if it's possible try to get a carb and a veggie to share it's shareable!",

I then had a portion of the bone in rib eye, that was tough.   The rest of folks in my group ordered steaks. We also had cream spinach and au gratin potatoes. Not a single person in the group was pleased with the food. Particularly, when considering the price.  I left hungry, so I went back to my hotel and ordered dinner.

The seating was very prompt, they pull out your chair and place your napkin on your lap.. very fancy.   The bread is like a hollow croissant roll which is delicious! They bring one at a time but it's unlimited. The butter comes on a design on a small plate.  Our drinks were tasty, came quickly.  For an appetizer we got the king crab deviled eggs. They were good... nothing too special honestly.  Entrees were the rib eye and filet and shareable sides were the mushrooms and gratin potatoes. Steaks were cooked to perfection, mushrooms were amazing. Potatoes tasted like plain scalloped potatoes, could've used more seasoning and cheese.  Dessert was pecan pie with caramel and vanilla ice cream.. amazing.   The service was great, our waters were never once empty, plates always cleared and food came out quickly.  Over all it was a great date and experience. I would highly recommend if you haven't been. Being out of state we probably wouldn't go back because there are hundreds of other places for us to try first and we don't go to Vegas that often.",

Everything we had was sort of meh...  Started with french onion soup...steakhouse staple right? Wrong...it didn't have much flavor and was pretty one dimensional. Limp, flaccid, no flavor onions.  My steak...prime, dry-aged rib-eye on the bone. After being schooled by the waiter on how \"they cook their steaks\" and what medium rare means. I get a medium well steak instead of the medium rare that i ordered. What a waste of a good piece of meat or at least I assume it was before they over-cooked it.  Creamed spinach - another steakhouse classic they can't screw up right? It's got this weird taste and texture, not sure what it was, but didn't even eat half of it.  Very disappointing, really not worth the $$$ or even the time unforuntately. Don't bother.",

The drinks were strong, but again, I expect that for the prices they charge. We started with bread and butter.  The bread was sweet and very light.  I didn't particularly enjoy the sweetness of the bread. For appetizers, we had the seafood tower and gumbo.  Nothing mind blowing. In fact, I've had better gumbo in New Orleans.  I had the filet mignon and my partner had the ribeye.  The steaks were cooked perfectly and the seasoning was delicious. Any sides you want with your steak order (baked potato, mushrooms, etc) is an extra charge. Again, I expect SOMETHING to go along with my steak order for the prices they charge. It was a special night, so the splurge isn't the issue.  I just don't feel like I received much value for the products we received.  You're better off going to Outback Steakhouse, in my opinion.",

Both amazing places.  The reason I am only giving this place two stars is because I compare it to those fine dining establishments that we ate at previously.  For high end dining it was not very good this place is extremely expensive. The wine by the glass list is priced at least 30% higher than wine by the glass at other high-end restaurants.  We started with the foi gras appetizer as I love this dish and order it at any restaurant when available.  We were very disappointed and were unable to even finish it it was so unappetizing. The slab of foi gras was too thick and extremely slimy. I expect it to be slimy this was excessive.  Our waiter was odd. He was not helpful and he lurked around  the table not saying anything. Husband ordered fillet. I ordered the sea bass. Neither were very tasty. We ended up only eating half of our meal and then leaving.  We've eaten at a lot of high-end steakhouse is with different types of ambience. The ambience in this restaurant is strange. Save your money. There are way better restaurants in Vegas at lower price points delivering better food",

We celebrated my sister's birthmonth and she received a complimentary note and ice cream dessert.  We started the night with a buttered crostini with salami on top, compliments of the chef.  We ordered the grilled octopus and bbq shrimps as appetizers, both were very tasty and prepared our tastebuds for the scintilating steak.  For sides, we had the buttered asparagus, mushrooms with multiple types, and duckfat fingerling potatos.  I had a bone-in rib eye that was well done with herb butter adorning the top which slowly seeped through the tender cut and infused the meat juices to provide for an even more flavorful bite.  For dessert we had Emeril's banana cream pie and the caramel butter cake, both so decadent and sweet, what a way to end a meal:)  The servers were very attentive and efficient.  The restroom, though it was a long hallway away and only had 2 stalls, was clean and well kept.  The ambience was classy and loud in some areas due to the archways and cavernous ceilings reminiscent of a wine cellar.  The dinner was very satisfying and the whole experience was an example of Emeril's excellence.  Thank you Delmonico Steakhouse for becoming one of my favorite strips of steak on the Las Vegas Strip!",

    "text": "First time to Delmonico, and there are many things to like about this restaurant. A little context: I went just before Christmas so this is a slower time for Vegas. Nonetheless, I had no problem making a reservation the afternoon of (mere hours), and the host was quite friendly over the phone. We arrived at the appointed time and were quickly whisked away to our table. While the restaurant setting is quite nice, we arrived in nice sweaters and jeans, yet did not feel conspicuous. The seating is unlike most restaurants I've patronized; each table is spaced a fair distance from the next, making it quite a delightful (and quieter) experience. Fast forward to the meal: Delicious and unique! I might pass on the truffle potato chips again, simply because they really are just potato chips and truffle oil...nothing terribly special, but this is a matter of personal taste and to each his own. The staff were professional and knowledgeable and delivered the food in a delightfully coordinated way (split plates placed simultaneously before us). We were not bothered during dinner, but there was always someone about, just in case! You can view the kitchen through glass and a quick observation assured me that our food was being prepared in a clean setting and by experienced hands. Bottom line: Delmonico is worth a visit if you value unique flavors and well-prepared dishes in a quiet (ish), professional environment.",

    "text": "Perhaps my expectations were too high. Let me start off by saying, the hype about their 16 oz Bone-in Ribeye ($52) is well deserved.  It's flavorful, has exquisite marbling, and served at a medium rare perfection.  But that's where the hype ends.  Sure, the lobster bisque is good and the shrimp appetizer is tasty, but for what we paid overall, I know there are better options here in the city.    So, I would say to you -- go for their Bone-in Ribeye and leave all other expectations behind.  It's a great meal, just didn't make it to my list of favorites.",

    "text": "Pescatarian review:  We came here because we had a hotel credit to use from the Palazzo so it was our fancy meal of the trip.   I am a pescatarian so I had: -Chardonnay -Complimentary bread: lovely -Halibut with chantarelle mushrooms and black-rice risotto: the chanterelles were yummy. The halibut was well cooked and delicate. The black-rice risotto was different but overall, this dish was not real exciting.  My family's dishes:  -Chateaubriand: at $120 for 2 people, this was probably the best deal since it's the only one that came with sides of asparagus and mashed potatoes. -Filet Mignon -Rib Eye -Broccoli side -Baked potato  They thought the rub was a little too salty and the rib eye meat to not be as high quality. The filet mignon and chateaubriand got a \"pretty good\" otherwise.  The service here is very good. I'd say the decor is lacking. In a strip of restaurants in a 5 star hotel, it wasn't very grand and the entrance was easy to miss. It could have felt fancier.  All in all, an ok first time at an Emeril restaurant.",

They cut it up for you as well. Absolutely delicious. Pumpkin Ravioli very good. Creamy. It's got a rich taste to it. Bread puffs are like Yorkshire pudding. Delicious. Don't eat too many before the meal. French onion was okay. Came a little lukewarm. Too much cheese. Could use less cheese and more bread IMO. Potato's gratin was good. Mushrooms were great but wanted more button mushrooms. Great mix of mushrooms but the seasoning was incredible. Banana cream pie was insane. Highly recommend if you like bananas. Not that much banana cream though, which I like. Still very good. Now the service. It was like every table was VIP. Our server Nicole and her assistant (I think that's what you call them) Peter were a dynamic duo. Drinks always refilled anything you need it was there. More bread, extra napkins. Everything on demand. What my family liked about Nicole the most was her honesty and knowledge of the menu. You don't get that anymore. It's hard to come by. She knew about all the dishes and gave us the information we needed to make our decisions. Highly recommend this place to people visiting.",

It was not so bad but I wouldn't recommend it due to its price, not really worth it (though what food is worthy its price on strip lol...) The LOBSTER BISQUE was fine, tasted similar to Joe Fortes in Vancouver. PAN SEARED FOIE GRAS was a bit toward sweet side, meaning it tasted a bit too sweet for me but also maybe I was having it as my main. I think if I didn't have the whole dish but shared it instead, it would be fine. HOWEVER, the char brussel sprouts was way too bitter!! It's like 85% black and inedible... I would have rated 2 star only but the bus boy was attentive and professional (I would not say the same about our waiter though...) Generally, I would not come back here to dine again since there wasn't really anything standing out or special. But other than the sprouts, we did not have a bad dining experience. It's an OK restaurant, but do you really want to just do OK when you go to Vegas? lol",

I had been told by multiple people that we MUST eat here.  I don't remember telling the restaurant  when I made the reservations that it was my anniversary---but I must have.  Talk about rolling out the red carpet for us!  The service is beyond comparable to any other in their class.  We were treated like royalty--yet it was in a very down to earth sort of way.  When we walked in I was nervous that is was a very \"snooty\" type of place.  I couldn't have been more wrong. Everyone was so easy to talk to and helpful with choosing dishes and drinks.  My husband and I both chose the recommendations that came from our wait staff.  I use the word \"staff\" since multiple people helped us.  From our bone-in steaks, to the  Pinot, everything was perfect!  We had the tomato salad and then sides of cream corn and potatoes au gratin.  I can't begin to explain how delish everything was!  I'm bummed that we did not order the banana cream pie, as everyone has asked me about it, but we were absolutely stuffed.   Our server brought us a complimentary dessert with a hand written Happy Anniversary note.  Such a nice touch!  I wish I could give it more that 5 stars!",

We both ordered the signature bone-in Rib eye steak.  So perfect.  charred onthe outside, perfectly pink and soft on the inside.  Oh, my.  So very very good.  And the Popovers they give you are super wonderful too.  We had no room for dessert and had to leave some steak behind.   My complaints:   Restrooms are 20 MILES FROM THE DINING ROOM! I am disabled and walking is very difficult for me.  that was hard.  Also the interior:  STARK WHITE, WHITE, WHITE.  there are alcoves built into the walls-- empty!  Not a bit of art, color, whimsy, knick knacks or anything in the place (except for the burgundy rims of the china).  All that white made me feel like I was in a medical setting-- not warm and inviting at all,  Our waiter told us that \"you are supposed to be in a wine cave\".  No way... really bothered me to be in that all white setting, ruined the mood in a way.  No ambience at all.  But A+ food and service really saved the day!",

Ordered both the foie gras and the truffle Parmesan potato chips to start. They were both brought to the table at the same time so I knew I would need to eat the foie gras first which was quite good. The potato chips were great, and since I had ordered the wagyu ribeye for $90, I didn't want to fill up on the chips, I asked if they could box up the chips to take back to my room.  No problem, and they were delicious the next day! The wagyu ribeye is the best beef I've ever had! Perfect med-rare with great flavor and the most tender beef ever! I've had wagyu at other steakhouses in LV, but this blew away the competition!  The size was perfect for me: 6 or 8 ounces (I forgot which). Since this is white truffle season, I chose the white truffle ice cream that is vanilla ice cream stuffed with lots of small pieces of truffle. It is served as 3 balls which I figured I'd eat one or two, but it was so addictive that I ate the whole thing! Service was very friendly and attentive. Delmonico Steakhouse is now my favorite steakhouse!",

In a town that tries to pinch you for every nickel bringing in our own wine, a 2001 Peju ($200+ bottle) from our personal cellar may have hurt his pocket.  Living here in Vegas probably raised my standard of Service, especially when you take home six figures as a Professional Server.   Yup.  It is a career here vs a job for most places in the world.

Hub's had the Lobster Sliders -- divine. We each had a glass of wine, so it was an $80 lunch, with tip.  Service was spotty.  The assistant waiter was great, but our lead waiter was very distracted and barely attended the table.

Safe to say food was decent considering the price.   Filet mingnon was tender but good. Not great. I have liked the filet at cut much better.   Crab legs were bland but amazingly precut and offered at either a cold or hot temperature.   The lobster bisque was ok too. I think I had expected the greatness I found with McCormick's lobster bisque. Safe to say for the price I would probably go to cut again or lawrys or McCormick. Probably wouldn't want to go back here. Sorry kids. But that's just me.",

I am usually a New York Strip guy, but I was hungry so I opted for the bone in ribeye for the first time here.  Birthday girl had the filet mignon. Sides included smashed potatoes and broccoli.   Bone in ribeye: Humongous! Probably 20oz. +  Beautifully crusted, with just the right amount of seasoning. Steak as always, cooked perfectly medium rare, which made for an amazingly juicy and flavorful experience.   Filet Mignon: Now normally I am not a filet person, but I did try a piece or maybe two.  Beautiful crust and to my surprise it also had excellent flavor.  Tender as you would expect from a great cut of Filet Mignon.  However, still not as juicy as my steak was.  Service as usual, impeccable.  Insanely large wine list, with almost every wine imaginable.  Complimentary amuse bouche and bread are also delicious.",

    "text": "This was supposed to be a very special dinner for 10 for my husband's 50th birthday. Four other couples flew in  from all over to celebrate with us and the first problem is that they seated us at a table for 9. The hostess called that morning and said 9, I corrected her and let her know there were 10 and she said she'd call me back by noon to confirm but I never heard back. Regardless, this Open Table reso said 10 so I didn't worry about it until we all sat down, realized we were one short, and had to get back up and go wait in the bar.  When were seated at a proper table, the appetizers that I'd pre-ordered were sitting out on the table, including fried oysters which had gone ice cold and soggy (very gross). We had to ask for bread long after entrees were served and it was cold, mushy things that looked like they used to be popovers (I thought I'd remembered a wonderful bread service before...?) And so on with the poor service... I've eaten here before and service and food were five stars. But the bone-in ribeyes were bland and not well-marbled, the bone-in bacon was 100% bone-in fat (of course bacon is very fatty but there was NO meat to be found at all) and the service was severely lacking in detail and common meal planning skills. I could list all the issues but you get the picture. Very disappointing. The best part of the meal was the fresh oysters in the seafood tower, very fresh and delicious.",

Walking past it in the Venetian, you wouldn't believe it extends back to a full restaurant.  The ambiance is elegant, comfortable, but friendly.  The manager came out before our meal to greet us and wish me a happy birthday, which was rather special.  The wine list was over 100 pages long and took us quite some time to decide which bottle to get.  We had the truffle & parmesan potato chips, which were just okay, and a small charcuterie plate with homemade cheese chips. For our main courses, I ordered the filet mignon.  My date ordered the bone in ribeye with foie gras.  My steak was arguable the best steak I've ever had.  It was perfectly buttery, seared and charred on the outside but tender, moist, juicy, and pink on the inside.  I had a bite of the ribeye with foie gras, which was just savory overload. For dinner, we received a complimentary \"Happy Birthday\" sorbet with a candle in it.  I had a great experience there and would go back again for the steak.  I only gave 4 stars and not 5 because the other menu items (starters and sides) were very forgettable.  The steak however, was unforgettable.   Date night seal of approval!",

It came out juicy and perfectly cooked. My complaint would be it lacked seasoning, I had to add salt and pepper, without it, it tasted like it was lacking a little in flavor. I had a glass of wine, and tried a couple of their signature cocktails, a mint juliep drink and a lychee flavored one, both were very good.   Overall a decent meal but did feel a little out of place as we were leaving because me and my friend were both dressed super casual, shorts and a tee, while the rest of the people that had started to show up while we were eating were much more formal.",

You can tell that his craft goes into every drink.  I sat at the bar, sipping what could have very well been the BEST Old Fashioned I've ever had and I watched him work.  He has the same passion behind the bar as a painter with a canvas, except his paint is liquor and his canvas, a glass.  With his jigger as a brush, he creates a drinkable Jackson Pollock  My steak was perfectly prepared and my time at the bar was most enjoyable.  It was a perfect finish to a long work week in Vegas.

    "text": "Dined there last weekend with some friends and we were utterly disappointed. Not impressed one bit. I don't understand how this restaurant received such high ratings, but I certainly would not go back nor would I recommend to anyone. From the food, the service, the ambiance - huge let down.  I would've given this place an additional star if the service wasn't so terrible.  The server was slow and was more interested in chatting.  Also, we waited at least 30 min to get our entrees(they didn't even seem busy).  After our table was cleared from apps and salads, we waited 20+ min before calling our server to check up on our food. She said it was still within the \"window\" and she couldn't do anything. Luckily, she spoke to her manager after another 5-10 min because that's when our food was \"officially late.\"   What we had (from what I can recall): BBQ Shrimp - shrimps were cooked unevenly and drowned in mediocre BBQ sauce. Some were cooked well, but mine was under.  Vine-Ripened Tomato Salad - nothing special Baked Crab Stuffed Lobster - lobster tail cooked well, but tough to eat and nothing amazing NY Strip - no flavor Filet - nice crust from the Essence stuff Sauteed Garlic Mushrooms - standard Potato Gratin - bit on the dry side Creamed Corn Gratin - best side order we had on the table, but that doesn't mean much.  Dessert: Sorbet, banana cream pie, apple fritters, key lime pie. The desserts and our bottle of wine were probably the highlight of this dinner.  If you are looking for a good steakhouse on the strip, this is NOT the place. You'll probably have better luck at Mastro's, Stripsteak, Prime, or Craftsteak.",

The atmosphere is simple and classic, it occurred to me that they were striving to feature the food with such simple ambiance, and they succeeded.   The service was fantastic, we had a team of servers for our party of 6 and we did not wait for a single thing throughout dinner. They did manage to find that balance between being attentive and hovering, it was perfect. Hubby and I had the table side prepared Cesar salad and it was excellent. For dinner I had the rare filet and I really enjoyed it, and the table shared the grits (my personal favorite of the entire dinner), spinach and mushrooms. For desert we had the peppermint profiteroles, which were so so (I'm not a big peppermint fan though).   I really enjoyed dinner and highly recommend it for a nice dinner in Vegas.",

They are also known their New Orleans BBQ Shrimp appetizer and it is delicious (I try to make it at home.)  There are tasty desert selections and wine ranging from $30 to $50,000.    The front room tends to be noisy since everyone has to pass through it at some point.  Request a table by the kitchen or along the right side of the room.

It was a 6 course meal and it was just too good. First they came out with the chips, something good to pick at until more food came out.. Soup, a refreshing trio platter that consist of fruit, crab meat, and a small salad. Then a piece of salmon topped with a thinly, crunchy slice of potato on top w/ veggies and a to die for sauce.. Then lamb with risotto. The risotto wasn't cooked to my liking but I was super full to even finish this..  I was finally excited for the dessert platter. It was a FULL plate of all the desserts they offered.. Pecan pie, bread pudding, a chocolate cake, cheesecake, and banana cake. My personal fave was their bread pudding and pecan pie.. Mmmmm  If my brother wasn't one of the chefs here we wouldve paid ridiculous amounts of money.. I havent been here in a hot sec and I really want to go back..

The food was delicious...and yes, it's a steakhouse, but I'd go back just for the banana cream pie. Oh...how I long for that pie. Anyway...the standout though has got to be the service. When our steaks came, I was disappointed to see that my steak had been overcooked - but it was clearly a busy night (and it looked like they had some crazy difficult customers that night), and I'm not usually one to complain, so I figured it still tasted good, and said nothing. But the manager, Ken, was nearby, and must've seen me sort of picking and inspecting my food, and he came by to make sure things were okay. I said they were fine, but he insisted on checking it out for me -- and in the end, even though I had already taken a few bites, he brought me a whole new steak and made sure it was cooked the way I liked before he left us to dine. That is fantastic service.   Food was delicious, foie gras was heavenly (damn you California for banning it!), and the service top notch.",

But the banana cream pie was horrible. It almost seemed like we were served a slice that was two weeks old - Very dry and not very creamy. Too bad the meal ended with luke warm coffee and no refills to wash down the pie. I have to say the service was uneven, like we were an afterthought once dessert was served.",

We were underdressed/too casual (shorts/tank tops) to sit in the formal dining area so we just shared a steak at the bar. We started off with drinks which were good and strong. I ordered the Lychee martini which was really good, and I couldnt even taste all the alcohol I watched him pour into. We shared a bone in ribeye, medium rare plus. The steak was really juicy and cooked perfectly, but it lacked flavor... We had to ask for salt and pepper. :(  I don't know if I'd go out of my way to come back... Maybe if I stayed at Venetian and needed another quick bite again.",

We had Fois gras and steak tar tar for apps (daalishsus), then there was a few perfectly cooked melt in your mouth ribeye steaks with daalishsus sides and an order of the butternut squash ravioli!! So buttery rich you didn't want it to end! and of course there was dessert, creme brulee and John brought the bday boy some perfect sorbet! ugh!!! Seriously where do they get off??  Then to top it off they had the nerve to provide amazing service as well! John, I assume the manager, was great very attentive, fun, well humored!! We will absolutely be returning especially since the birthday boy can't stop talking about it! Lol thank you Delmonico's staff for being awesome!",

The cane syrup sauce did help bring out the flavor but it was still well done and I was not given the option when I ordered the duck as to how rare/well done I would like it. I do understand that it is a steakhouse, however if it is on the menu it needs to be of equal quality as the red meat. Also, I tasted the mint ice cream profiteroles and the bread pudding served with butter pecan ice cream. Both house made ice creams were the best I'd ever tasted with a fantastic creaminess and balanced flavor, however the bread in both desserts were superfluous, didn't add anything and just weren't that spectacular. The service we received was fantastic.",

    "text": "I went to Delmonico with a large group for a friend's birthday recently.  There were about 20 of us, split up over 3 circular tables.  It would have been great to have one long table, but I understand the constraint.  We were seated as soon as the birthday girls arrived after having a drink at the bar.  The service was excellent!  There were a lot of us and the staff was courteous and knowledgable about the menu and the wine list.    Let me preface my review of the food by saying that I don't eat red meat.  I know steak is their speciality, so I was knowing order what they don't go best.  I started with the shrimp cocktail, which included 4 large shrimp, cocktail sauce and some garnish.  The shrimp were cooked very well, but it was a regular shrimp cocktail.  The cajun marinade imparted a little extra kick, but nothing remarkable.  Next, I had the snapper entree.  Almost everyone else at my table ordered the rib eye, which was enormous.  Like Man vs. Food big.  The piece of snapper looked so tiny in the bowl next to the big steaks!  In all honesty though, it was a regular portion.  The lentils were a great addition, as were the brussel sprouts.  However, the fish seemed to have been sitting out for a while.  The top was dry like it had been under the heat lamps.  I understand that it's tough to coordinate one peice of fish when you have to prepare 15+ rib eyes for the same set of tables, but that snapper still cost me $40.  I didn't have dessert since we brought a cake, but the coffee at the end was good.  I'm not saying that I wouldn't return to Delmonico, but knowing there are so many other steakhouses in Vegas that have a stronger reputation for seafood, if it's my choice, I'd probably choose to go elsewhere.",

I don't know what the wait staff to guest ratio is, but it has to be 2-1. I also absolutely LOVE how they put every person's plate down at the exact same time, period. You're a party of ten? Then ten of Delmonico's finest serve you all at once. And man do they now their business. I've never had a recommendation be anything but excellent!  The food.... Did I say wow???? My personal favorite is the bone-in rib eye, but all of the meat is fantastic. I order mine rare, so it is easy to get a tough steak, but not here!!! It is just lie butter.... Yum.... The BBQ shrimp are amazing, and homemade truffle potato chips??? Wow.... I could go on and on.... Creme Brule is amazing, as is the bread pudding.  I simply can't say enough about Delmonico's. It is simply worth every penny!!!!",

I had been wanting to try one of Emeril Lagasse's restaurants for awhile and was really excited to dine at Delmonico, but the food didn't blow me away like I had expected it to. Their gumbo was good, but lacked a bit of salt. Their pork chops were good, but could have been a little more tender. My friend noted that the texture of the steak was a bit off. Their desserts were good, but the chocolate cake was kind of dry. Everything was \"good\", but nothing was great. Wait...I take that back - their dinner rolls were delicious!   Although I really enjoyed my Delmonico experience overall, I don't think I'll be returning anytime soon. (I have yet to find a steakhouse that I like better than Mastro's!)",

I can happily chicken every day... buuut every now and then I get that naughty craving for some good ol' American red meat! :D  So ex-roomie and I went to Vegas to visit friends of hers and I told her we could do whatever they wanted & all I wanted in return was to visit one of the famous pricey Vegas steakhouses. All agreed and so we booked a reserv. for Delmonico.   The decor was simple, but elegant... kinda mod, imho. Looked very exclusive from the outside, so I felt all fancy. :D  I have to give MAJOR props to the waiters(s), especially an awesome young gentleman who was a total sweetheart (I think his name was Andre..). Actually, I was shellshocked at the great service... most pricey restaurants are pretty snooty, but the peeps @ Delmonico were warm and super attentive.  Unfortunately, there was major drama @ my table with a couple of the girls (snide remarks,  tears, running to the bathrooms), throughout which Andre (?) remained patient. I tuned all this out because................................  ..... I WAS HAVING MINI MOMENTS OVER MY AMAZING, TENDER, SUCCULENT AND DELICIOUS BONE-IN RIBEYE!!!  holy mother. The thing was huge and ex-roomie and I actually shared it (with Andre sweetly saying that it was not a problem) and it was STILL too much. Had my steak been anything but spectacular, I would have been mortified at the shenanigans. Instead, I swiped some artichoke spears (crisp, fresh and awesome) & truffle potato chips (a little greasy but OMG, so good)  from the other ladies and dug into the side we ordered, which was the potato au gratin (again, a little heavy but OHHH... so amazingly tasty... my favorite side dish!)   Crazy delicious food, beautiful ambiance and wonderful service, and actually, with the magic of sharing, did not break the bank. I will definitely be back!!!!!",

You had to talk very loudly in order for the other side of the table to hear you, which just contributes to the already loud atmosphere.    The food was on par for a steak house of this caliber though a little on the high side, which is premium you pay for the Lagasse name.  I can't review anything that already hasn't been said.  I had the rib eye which was good, sides I can't even remember.  Bread as others have mentioned was not memorable.  I'll have to disagree with others about the banana cream pie..  just didn't seem to have the flavor I was expecting.. just a lot of not sweet enough whipped cream.  Service was great though.

One of the dishes was a quail which I normally am not fond of but they did such a good job I devoured it. The wine pairing was excellent and they were generous with their pours. I even took a full glass back to my room at the end of the night. Excellent service and food! My new favorite place!",

    "text": "Just hit this place for the 3rd time in 2 years and this place never let's down.  I was there just this past weekend during a very busy time at the Venetian with 2 major conventions going on.  We were fortunate enough to get a reservation with the host we prefer at 7:30 pm.  Game on!!  Service is impeccable.  We have a specific host who takes care of us when we come in so I suggest you get to know yours cause it does make getting reservations much easier.  Not only that, but you have a better time in general when you feel you have a friend there.  And trust me, I'm no high roller.  Each section has its own host and several supporting cast.  Some hosts are better than others so again if you like yours try to stick with him/her.  They usually start you with an amuse bouche compliments of the chef.  Always different and always outstanding.  It's no meal just a way of getting your taste buds started.  The food will be brought as per normal or as you request.  You're in control so let them know what you want and they will help you better.  Even with wine selections of which they have a large selection.  The place can get a lot of hustle (not normal) so just try to sit tight and enjoy your meal.  They won't rush you so don't rush yourself.    I go straight for the steak but i hear the appetizers are fantastic.  I highly recommend the Wet/Dry Aged Bone In Rib Eye Medium.  The outside will be crusted just right with a pat of house made butter on top.  Inside will be pink and juicy (order med/rare if you want blood) and soft not chewy.  The meat will melt in your mouth as this cut has just the right amount of marbling (great now I want one).  Desert?  The steak is desert enough for me (lol).    Service is impeccable.  We have a specific host who takes care of us when we come in so I suggest you get to know yours cause it does make getting reservations much easier.  Not only that, but you have a better time in general when you feel you have a friend there.  And trust me, I'm no high roller.  Don't forget, Bone in Rib Eye!!",

Sure the bill was a bit much, but I think that in addition to paying for the Emeril name, you are paying for the stellar service.  Once in a while - this works for me!  A man pushing in my chair, another refilling my water and another taking the cover off my plate - wow.  We had an array of dishes:  the bone in steak, pork chops, mashed potatoes, creamed spinach.  The sides look small, but they fill you up and you can share them family style.  Funny, my mom got seared scallops which was a small plate, but they were so delicious!  We had these large plates of meat and we were picking off her dish.  LOL.  Everything was great,  I wasn't expecting something amazing, but we did feel full and like we got a good meal.    The dessert was just okay.  We got the bread pudding and coffee. It is good to go to Vegas and try new places are there are so many quality restaurants.  Def glad I went!",

So... this place exudes Power Lunch without the Noise ambiance...Soft lighting, quiet/hush talking, white table clothes, ultra professional service, a fabulous menu and high prices.  Everyone except me was in a business suit... but like I care.    My g-friend ordered sort of off the menu... the options were on the menu but the way she wanted it prepared was not.  They didn't even bat an eye... they just asked a couple questions to make sure they \"did it right\".  She got grilled salmon and steamed / lightly sauteed spinach.... and it came out perfect!  It looked fabulous.  I just ordered the cobb salad.  I know... I'm boring that way.  But it was a really good cobb salad... the bacon... OH!  The bacon! on my salad was The Best!  Freshly grilled skinny strips of bacon that were juicy and meaty.  I'll order it again just for the bacon \"bits\".  The avocado was fresh and creamy... the blue cheese crumbles were rich and blue-cheesy.  All in all, a very nice salad.    Service was very professional and attentive without being annoying. They filled our iced tea and water without us even noticing.  It was awesome.  For lunch... it's pricey ... the two of us was $52 w/o tip....but if you want a really, really nice business lunch or a lunch that is NOT noisy, crowded or typical... Go Here.  I'll be back because they have Lobster Sliders on the menu now... I gotta go back to try these.  :)",

I got the rib-eye not knowing that it was huge and was really surprise when I saw it. I should have shared and thought the portion was great for 50 bucks. I ordered medium well, but it was redder than normal. I thought it was over seasoned. The potatoes were really good though. The service was okay--we had a big party and they accommodated us, but I felt that since we were a younger crowd than normal, they didn't give the best service they could. The server didn't really smile and forgot one of our checks and so we had to wait for a while to get it backs.  The people in my party that didn't get steak enjoyed their dishes. If I go next time, I wouldn't order steak but yet this is a steakhouse..",

    "text": "I had dinner here on 2/7.  The last time I was here was over 10 years ago.  The last Vegas steakhouse that I had eaten at was CUT, so that is what I will be comparing my experience to. Service:  Very Good.  We had at least 3-4 servers taking care of us (party of 5) throughout the night.  Initially dinner was for a party of 4.  However, once we were seated, our buddy landed at the airport and decided to join us.  I informed the head server (thinking that they may not be able to accommodate) and he immediately converted the table to seat 5 (pulled out stuff from the bottom to make it a round table).  Water was constantly filled and table cleared off in appropriate fashion. Food:  We started off with the Caesar Salad and Ahi Tuna/Salmon tartare.  I thought the salad was just ok.  A tad too much dressing.  Same with the tartare.  Nothing special and pretty bland.  Most of the group got the bone in rib eye (medium rare to medium well).  All were cooked well.  I thought the medium rare tasty pretty good.  Nothing spectacular about it, just good steak.  I had the rack of lamb (medium rare) and it had decent flavors.  I would take Carvino's lamb chops over it any day.  The sides we had were decent (Potato gratin, mushrooms, and corn).  We had a nice bottle of wine that the Sommelier recommended with a price point of $85.  That was probably the best tasting thing of the night. The verdict on Delmonico's is that it is a decent steakhouse that it's reputation is based on its name more than its food.  I would choose CUT over it any day.  They have more selection of meat (cuts and quality).",

    "text": "I love Delmonico's, I really do.  But this past weekend, it just didn't measure up.  I should have gone with my gut and given CUT a try.  We started with drinks in the bar, which was fine.  Our table for seven was ready on time, which is always nice.  Unfortunately, our service was super average compared to what I've had in the past at Delmonico's and at other comparable high end steakhouses.  My husband and I shared a salad for an appetizer.  We let the server know this when we ordered and in the past, we've had this served on two separate plates in lieu of having to divide the salad at the table.  Unfortunately, we were given to salad plates and told we could split it ourselves.    I love a good filet, and unfortunately, my filet was very average.  It was cooked to my liking, medium rare, but it was served relatively cool, which made me think that our food was sitting for a while before it was served.  My mom ordered seared ahi tuna which was served completely cold.  The outer edges were completely cooled after the searing, which again, tells me that our food sat out for a while.  My husband and my brother both ordered bone-in rib-eyes.  When the food was served, they brought one rib-eye that had been split in two.  The server went back to the kitchen and they realized they made a mistake and brought out the other rib-eye, while using tongs to take the half from my husband's plate and added it to my brother's plate.  Rookie move, seriously.  My family doesn't eat a ton of cards, so for sides we ordered two servings of the mushrooms, broccoli, and corn for my niece.  The server kept pushing for us to order a starch, which we insisted we didn't want- very bizarre, it's not like we weren't running up a pretty hefty tab.  It was my mom's birthday and I really thought Delmonico's would come through with an excellent experience.  The food was okay overall, but I really can't say that this meal met my expectations or anyone at our tables' expectations.  I've been to many Emeril restaurants, maybe they went through a recent management change??  I don't know, I wish I could explain the extremely average experience.",

    "text": "Really wish I could give this a higher review but with all the competitive steakhouses in Vegas, steakhouses need to be TOP notch.  Our server was pretty inattentive. Took about 10-15 minutes to receive a wine/cocktail menu. Server was friendly though. Popup bread (complimentary) was delicious! We ordered off of the prix fix menu. Make sure you ask the server for this menu because it's only listed on a sign outside but not found anywhere on the menu. I had the tomato soup with ricotta grilled cheese. By far, best tomato soup I have ever had. My boyfriend and I also ordered different types of steaks. We ordered them to be cooked medium rare. His came out perfect- pink all the way through, juicy tender. However, mine was VERY rare- like almost a shade of blue. For a steakhouse, this is VERY disappointing. The other issue with this is after we received our food no one checked in and it took a while for me to flag down one of our servers (we had three servers/workers for our table). So my boyfriend was almost done with his steak before we were even checked on and received a new one. Manager did come over and apologize for but a steakhouse in Vegas, I feel the temperature of a steak has to be on point.   For desserts, we ordered the pecan pie. I don't even like pecan pie and it was DELICIOUS. I was pretty disappointment with my caramel butter cake. Cake was very dry but the sauce on the bottom was EXCELLENT.   Overall, okay place to have dinner. But due to the inattentive service and not consistent steak temperatures, I would consider another steak house that is more consistent.",

    "text": "My first review on yelp. Only reason I'm doing this review is because of Delmonico's Steakhouse at The Venetian. We were tired of the average buffets and fast food and we really wanted to have a fancy night. So we looked up on yelp for a nice fancy restaurant. We decided on Delmonico's and called in to make reservations for two at 530. Came 530, we were still at the pool, so we called in and pushed the reservation to 630. Staff accommodated us, which was surprising. We came to restaurant at 630 and were seated immediately. The staff are on the dot with their reservations. Right after we were seated, the waiter asked what we would like to drink. I ordered a usual neat Johnny Walker Black Label and followed it with a 7&7. I believe every man should learn to love whiskey. My lady ordered a water lol. We then looked at the menu. I read all the reviews on yelp and just jumped straight to the assortment of steaks they had available. My lady ordered a New York T Bone Steak and I had the filet mignon. We also ordered the Butternut squash ravioli for the appetizer and mashed potatoes to eat with the steaks.   First came ravioli. It was 5 pieces of ravioli. My first thought was,\"Damn I'm getting jipped out of 15 bucks\" But when I bit into the first piece of ravioli, I literally had an mouth orgasm... No homo. It was the best ravioli I ever had in my life. Hands down. I wish I had a whole plate full of it. My lady was hella impressed as well.   Then came out the steaks. I hade mine cooked medium rare and she had hers done medium. The first bite was the best. Succulent, tender, easy to chew. Best steak I ever had in my life.",

The service was amazing as you would expect for this type of restaurant. I made a note on our OpenTable reservation that it was for his birthday and every single person wished him a happy birthday, by name, as well as giving us lots of free goodies!   We pretty much ordered everything our hearts desired (which was a lot more than our stomachs could hold):  Truffle and parmesan potato chips - sounds simple enough, but I definitely recommend. Nice, simple appetizer that happens to be divine.  Run of the mill mixed greens and lobster bisque. The lobster bisque is a must try! Best I've had!  Filet mignon and bone-in ribeye for our main course. Very flavorful, cooked to perfection. The bone-in ribeye is HUGE, so bring your appetite for this one.  We had chocolate sorbet on the house and ordered an additional slice of banana cream pie (we were curious why Emeril's name was attached to it). That is the first time I've had banana cream pie and I feel like I could never eat it again unless it came from here.   Wonderful experience and will definitely have to make a trip back.",

Our service was just ok until the end when our server scolded someone in our group and said \"sssshhhhh.\"   Really???

I mentioned to the hostess we were a lively group and to sit us accordingly.  She assured me it was not a problem.  We spent a lot of money and ended on a sour note--which is no bueno....it could've been handled so much better.  Also, they knew we were celebrating an anniversary and didn't bring a complimentary dessert??? (I think even Cheesecake Factory does that?).  It just seemed the waitress had a personality problem and didn't like us from the get go. Unfortunately, this is the second visit here where the service has fallen short.  Four stars for food.  Not in a hurry to go back.  There's no \"sssshhhhh-ing in Vegas!\"",

Sent back, too rare, came back still too red for a medium well and the sauce I'd ordered with it was now cold. The did make it right and brought me a new steak, cooked tableside to perfection with a fresh, warm brandy peppercorn sauce. Desert was fantastic!",

The timing of the food arriving at the table was right on time. The steaks were excellent and so were the side items. This was the first steakhouse I had been to that offered grits as a side item!!  This was one of the better meals I have had in my 13 years of coming to Vegas.   I would recommend the grits and brussel sprouts as a side item.",

The atmosphere was quiet yet festive; subdued yet exciting.    We arrived a few minutes early and they we were shown to our table immediately.  Service was impeccable.  We ordered a bottle of Pinot Grigio and sparkling water.  The Caesar salad made table side was absolutely delicious.  The gentleman serving is explained every step of the process.  The filet mignon at medium rare was seasoned to perfection and cooked perfectly.  We shared a twice baked potato, that was creamy and cheesy.   We ended the meal with two cappuccinos and we shared a perfect piece of pecan pie.  An amazing evening.",

    "text": "3.5 stars - above average steakhouse, amazing service, loud. Food highlights: free popovers, lobster bisque.   * Popovers - 5 stars: The BEST, small, light, airy, chewy, you could almost stuff the entire thing in your mouth. I've had good popovers at NM, but like the texture and size of these more. AND they give you a huge plate of softened salted butter - WINNER. * Lobster Bisque - 4.5 stars: One of the better lobster bisque's I've had! Great overall flavor, rich and decadent. * Side of mushrooms, creamed corn, fingerling potatoes - 3.5 stars: All of these were good. 3 kinds of mushrooms cooked generously in butter, my favorite. Followed by the creamed corn, very different with a strong jalapeno flavor. Fingerling potatoes standard. * Banana Cream Pie - 3.5 stars: Emerill's famous banana cream pie is huge - stacked high with chunks of fresh banana. The cream needed more banana flavor, seemed overwhipped, and the crust could've been more buttery. Was still good though. * Key Lime Pie - 3.5 stars: Really good key lime pie on an excellent crust, a little too sweet for me though. * German chocolate cake - 2 stars: Cake tasted airy, reminded me of box cake. Prefer Duncan Hines (sorry!). * Chateaubriand - 2.5 stars: Had an incredibly tender well-seasoned Tomahawk at Beauty and Essex, and in close second was Carnevino's. The Chateaubriand is a hunk of meat for two, sliced and cooked tableside. The meat was tender, but the texture kind of reminded me of a pot roast (not a fan), and it had a bit of a weird, gamey flavor....Recommend sticking with the ribeye.",

The atmosphere is perfect in noise level, pleasing color palate and space.  You are relaxed when you eat here.  The staff is welcoming and prideful in the job without sounding pretentious, the perfect blend of professional and friendly.    The food-OH THE FOOD- the spinach salad, basically heaven on a plate,  tender spinach with a well balanced sherry vinaigrette and praline bacon pieces.  Let's just say, I was sorry that I offered to split it.  The filet and bone-in rib eye (our selections) were grilled to perfection, and I mean, perfection!!  Don't let the creole crust intimidate you, it is not overpowering and they're not ruining a beautiful cut with \"stuff\".  The twice-baked potato was hearty and delicious.  They will suggest the banana cream pie, which looks great, but I chose the pecan pie in an oatmeal shortbread crust.  This was so beyond fantastic in its tender and unique crust to the mellow nutty sweetness of the filling.  I could seriously go on and on about this meal. I love to cook and I love to eat so it is a perfect evening when I feel like there is nothing I would change about the meal or think that I could have saved a ton of money and cooked myself.  Those thoughts NEVER ran through my mind.  So, next time I am in Vegas, I will return as soon as I get off the plane.  cannot wait.",

Very simple white decor and quiet atmosphere. No flash or gimmicks of some other steakhouses on the Strip.  My filet was prepared very well and I gobbled up my entire side of creamed corn casserole. I enjoyed a classic Manhattan at the bar before dinner while listening to a pianist in the lounge (nice touch).  I also had another bourbon drink called the Betty Crocker with walnut and banana flavoring during my meal. Unfortunately the banana flavoring came through too strong.  This is definitely a dessert cocktail, but was not listed that way on the menu.  Overall, a great dining experience.  Next time I will be sure to save room for Emeril's banana cream pie, which looks amazing.",

Potato croquettes were a delicious appetizer choice (even though they are officially a side dish for the steaks). The lobster bisque was outstanding, as was the gumbo. For entrees we both had the steak medallions with onion rings, bacon, and house made Worcestershire. Superb! Desserts are incredible here -- there are so many tempting choices but we finally narrowed it down to the caramel butter cake and the butterscotch pudding. While the caramel cake was very good, the star was the butterscotch pudding. It had praline sauce on the bottom, then the pudding topped with fresh whipping cream and candied bacon with shortbread cookies on the side. I've never had a dessert so complex and delicious. The value for the amount of food and drink we got was outstanding.",

The service was great, like we were his only table, and he had a crew, a team- they even referred to him as the \"captain.\" Fancy huh!?   Ravioli app was melting in my mouth. Delicious. Fried oysters were great, and better than some Rockafeller ones I've had in New Orleans. The truffle and Parmesan chips are great, (but Wolfgang Pucks are better!) these were really thin and tasty but a bit greasy. Parmesan and potato soup absolutely creamy deliciousness.   My fried chicken was huge - split it w someone. My friends steaks were great except one was overlooked and they took it off our bill, I mean obviously she didn't eat it and they did that, but no questions no rude judgements just took care of it.   Great place!",

The sommelier stopped by our table several times and selected a great bottle for the table. He even came back at the end of dinner to talk about what Texas wines we recommend. Truly exceptional service.   Drinks - you have to try one of their Sazeracs.   Food- blows me away how exceptional the food is here. Ribeye was cooked absolutely perfect medium rare.

    "text": "My husband and I ate here for Thanksgiving dinner and really enjoyed our meal.   I've eaten at many steakhouses in the area and I find that each one has their own unique style. Delmonico's interior isn't highly decorated or cluttered, just a simple and clean look. I liked the simplicity.   Our waiter and his team were very attentive. Water glasses were constantly filled, plates cleared efficiently, and service moved smoothly. They were all very professional.   The meal begins with popovers that are both soft and flavorful. I began my meal with the Wilted Spinach and Frisee salad. It was anything, but the usual frisee salad because every ingredient was taken to the next level. The bacon vinaigrette had a nice smoky bacon flavor which was tossed in just the right amount with the spinach. The candied bacon was amazing. They perfectly balanced the sweet and salty. The egg on top was cooked to perfection. All of the flavors worked so well together.   It was hard to order something other than steak, but it was Thanksgiving so I had to have my traditional dinner. The Thanksgiving dinner didn't disappoint and was a very generous portion. The turkey was very moist and flavorful. The plate had a nice mix of white and dark meat. Under piles of turkey was a moist, delicious cornbread stuffing. A delicious gravy was drizzled over the turkey and stuffing. There was a small side of green beans, but those were not the best thing on the plate as they were a stringy and mushy.  My husband and I split a Twice Baked Potato because you have to have potatoes on Thanksgiving. I'm glad we split because it was definitely enough for two. The potato was flavorful and covered in a nice cheese layer.  For dessert I had the Pecan Pie and my husband had the Thanksgiving dessert special. My Pecan Pie was served like a tart in a small round, flaky crust. The crust was buttery and flaky. I don't like crust usually, but this was very good. There was plenty of gooey pecan filing and a nice heap of ice cream on top. My husband's special dessert was a trio of pumpkin cheesecake, bread pudding, and ice cream. This kind of fell flat. Nothing had much flavor and was certainly not the best representation of the dessert menu.  I can't wait to return and try more of the regular menu items.",

This ties with the best service I've ever had and is second to none from my experience.   We don't have a lot of experience with wines and there was no hint of pretense or haughtiness from the staff and we felt very welcome and enjoyed the experience. The dress code was casual with no jacket and tie required.  They have a huge selection of cocktails and wines and we received friendly and helpful assistance in finding a wine to our liking and were immediately offered an alternative after the first selection didn't exactly meet my wife's liking.   The bone-in ribeye was perfect and I was very pleased with the Cajun seasoning used there (Emeril's). My wife had the rack of lamb and was very pleased with it. The pieces were very meaty.   The twice baked potato is HUGE and would be easy to share. The vegetable selections are also served with plenty to share so ordering one entree for each person in a couple with a single potato and single vegetable would work sell.   I can also recommend the creme Brule which had fresh fruit on top and was a very nice dessert to share.",

Although their cuts are bigger enough to split if you wanted to order a few apps and room but for us it was all steak type of night. Let's start with the ambiance it's self: like any other high end steak house very roomy and intimate setting. Lights are dim.    The device was top notch we we greeted immediate as we sat, water came out, and wine list brought to us. It was my wife's bday so we were definitely having a glass. Their drink menu had several options of wine, cocktails, etc.    The croissant that they bring out was fluffy and buttery. The knock is they bring you just one. I could have eaten 20. I'm sure if asked I could have had another.   I ordered the bone in New York strip and I have to say it was by far the best strip I've ever had. My wife ordered the ribeye and I did try a bite. While tender and tasted well. It was slightly warmer on temp than she liked. My strip was better. But by no means was her's bad. The twice baked potato tasted awesome and we shared an order. The steak being so large we could barely eat the side.   Price point is similar to all other 4 star and up type of steak houses. It is definitely one I'd go back next time in Vegas.",

    "text": "It is with a heavy heart, a disappointed palate, and an empty stomach that I write this review. At around 8:40pm on a Wednesday like any other, an amazing 20 ounce bone-in ribeye was murdered by the cooks at Delmonico Steakhouse in Las Vegas, Nevada. A senseless, tragic loss really.   The LD: Husband and I went for dinner. Were seated immediately; had reservations. Place was crowded; however, several tables were empty. Servers (yes, plural; they employ a multi-function staff system) were friendly and knowledgeable.   V&S for myself, beer for hub. Both ordered the highly recommended in-house aged big ass ribeye; cooked med-rare please? Add a side of asparagus.   Drinks were delivered, as was a meh amuse bouche (didn't do much to invoke my appetite). While waiting on main course, we sat with empty drink glasses for approximately 15 minutes. \"Yes, please, another round\" after flagging someone down.    The highly anticipated steaks arrived. Had SO looked forward to dining (have been to Delmonico in N'Oleans and LOVED it) - salivating for the meat like Pavlov's dog.  Husband cut into his steak first and I awed at the perfection. Beautifully cooked (I know my steak temps well and am quite skilled on the grill if I may say so; #humblebrag, but I do live in Texas after all). I could immediately tell when my plate was sat down in front of me my steak was overcooked. I even whispered it to my spouse. Sure enough, borderline well-done on the edges. I optimistically had hoped it would be less done toward the thicker center and toward the bone. Nope.     When a waiter came to follow-up and ask how the steak was, I informed him mine...well, was not good. He did offer to refire; however, given the speed that my husband eats, and the amount of time it took the food to be delivered in the first place, I [foolishly] declined and stated that it was \"fine.\"  Management comped one of the two Tito's I ordered as an apology; however, this did little to suppress my internal sadness and the most amount of disappointment I'd had since losing my ars at the blackjack tables the night before.   In all fairness, the staff at D's did try their best to accommodate. I probably should have allowed them a second chance to present a well-prepared piece of beef. It wasn't until I got home and found the $164 (w/out tip) receipt from the night in my wallet that I began to feel what can only be described as selfish-remorse (aka, sometimes referred to as \"buyer's remorse\").  So after a few days of ruminating (as females are sometimes known to do), I called the restaurant and told them I regretted my decisions and to thank them for at least attempting to \"satisfy the customer.\" Without any provocation, the manager offered to send me a gift card for $50 to cover a steak during my next visit. I, of course, did not expect the offer, but happily provided my mailing address.   I have found that an unfortunate outcome of many \"celebrity\" chef restaurants opening in LV is that the quality of both service and food suffer. It's the nature of Sin City and the abundance of tourism - people from all over the world with very different palates - some more or less discerning than others. :'(    So, now I have a GC that I can redeem at any of Emeril's establishments. I doubt I'll be using it at Delmonico in Vegas baby, because frankly I've left the building and think I'll stick to D's in the Big Easy. Sin City killed the beefy magic for me. Cheers!

It was quite pricey, but it was a very memorable dinner to say the least.  I truly felt special being lead to a private room  in the kitchen of the restaurant to dine with good company!  We had blinds to cover our space from the rest of the restaurant, even had our own music in our own room!  Being able to peer into the kitchen and watch the staff prep and cook while we eat alone already had a super cool factor to it!!!  I highly recommend it for anyone that is willing to splurge on a nice private wine and dinner pairing.  Our chef (Chef Erwin) and sommelier (Dylan) for the night were fantastic and every course/pairing I had was an absolute delight to my tasting palette.  Some of my favorites from the night were the truffle and parmesan chips, pork chops, steak, and dessert (esp the banana cream pie, and chocolate decadence cake, butter cake, and flan!).  I'm sure whoever your chef is for the night won't disappoint.  This chef's table beyond exceeded my expectations and I couldn't be happier to recommend this experience to anyone.  Dooooo it!!!",

We opted to celebrate my partners birthday celebration at Del's and it was definitely the best decision EVER. Although Las Vegas traffic sucked and it took 40 min to get there from Cosmopolitan.   We had the best crew serving us tonight, be sure to ask for Braden, Selina, and JoJo. Amazing folks with a great sense of humor and honest recommendations.   GET the chateaubriand and if you like spices, add the au poivre. Worth every penny and then some. Skip an appetizer unless you have multiple people in your party, the steak will fill you up and then some! We didn't have room for dessert but was treated to an ice cream waffle cone with a delicious flavor to celebrate the man's birthday.   Oh yeah, don't be shocked by the 100 page wine list or the bottles ranging up to $37,000. You can find some reasonably priced options! We will be back!",

    "text": "This might be the easiest review I've ever written because it writes itself. I can honestly say this was the best meal I've ever had.  Out of the hustle and bustle that is below The Venetian, there is a delicious oasis who awaits anyone who dares to enter (and open their wallets). There are (I'm sure) other fabulous restaurants in Restaurant Row, but walking into Emeril Lagasse's Delmonico Steakhouse was like taking a port key to a wine cavern in Italy. In the bar area was someone playing a grand piano for guests to enjoy while they sip cocktails, and the muted earth tones relax and ease away the stress of the strip. With that said you may need to pull out your phone flashlight to read the menu but it's all part of the ambience. I don't know how the filter out all of the noise of the casino but it's truly amazing.  A member of my party knew the sommelier so we had a pretty unbelievable table with a view of the kitchen. But I couldn't tear my eyes off of the wine menu to observe the magic. The wine list is literally 100 pages long (pro tip: flip to the very back for wines by the glass), and some of the wines are over $1000 a bottle. But there are reasonably priced options as well. The sommelier was super helpful and gave wonderful recommendations so don't hesitate to ask.  As for the food, you cannot go wrong. They do have gluten free options and can make some of the sides gluten free as well, just let your server know. The steak was the best steak I've ever tasted. Do not miss it served Oscar Style either: with crab meat and asparagus. The brussels were amazing with their sweet maple bacon glaze and roasted to perfection, and can you really order a steak and not get sauteed mushrooms? A side can feed 2, maybe 3 people so just order one to share if it's a small party.   It was my boyfriend's birthday and he got the bananas foster pie (pictured below), and again, perfection. I wish I didn't sound like such a broken record but it's been like 2 weeks and I'm still dreaming about it. Romantic and classy while still feeling relaxed and not so upscale that I felt uncomfortable, I would come back to Vegas just to come here again. Worth every penny!",

We got the potato croquettes and creamed corn for sides and everything was really good.   We were too full for dessert, but they brought us a mango sorbet with a candle for my birthday.

The dim lighting always set the romantic vibe.  The decor was fairly plain except the white linen boosted the sophisticated appeal.    The maitre d' was a bit obnoxious.  You would think someone in his role would be a little more friendly.  You want your patrons to feel welcomed.  Service was not that great.    We ordered the ribeye medium rare and it was undercooked.  Sending it back would have ruined the steak.  At least the meat was tender.  The flavor was lacking.  We also had three side dishes: creamed corn, garlic sauteed mushrooms, and garlic smashed potatoes.  All 3 tasted good.    In such a well renowned establishment, steak is expected to be superior.

I was worried the vibe at the restaurant was going to be snobby but to my surprise it wasn't. Everyone is there for a hearty meaty juicy plate of goodness! We ordered the ribeye as well as the New York strip with sides of mashed potatoes and creamed spinach. It was cooked perfectly to the T when I asked for medium rare; not too overcooked or too bloody, just perfection. The sides were a great addition to the meal because I'm not a carnivore I need my potatoes. Yes the total bill was horrific at the end but I must admit it was the best steak I've had in a while.

It has been probably close to 18 years since I have last been here and it was only because every time I tried to make a reservation at the last minute, there was no room.  I was so excited to get a reservation for the next day Friday in a busy September. When I got there, the first thing that was odd was the look/feel and location. It felt a bit boring and in need of a refreshing design. I felt totally distracted for some reason by the decor and ambiance.   Food wise, pretty darn good.  For starters we had the Artisanal Cheeses and shrimp cocktail. For entrees We had the bone in Ribeye, the Filet Mignon and Salmon. We also had sides of mushrooms and asparagus.  The meats were cooked to perfection, tasty and juicy.   Service was pretty darn good as well. From the waiter to the support staff I must say everyone is very well trained and pleasant.  Found the promptness if service and clearing the dishes was good but nearly too fast. Lingering is good too!  Dessert!  The  Emeril's Banana Cream Pie was awesome!  Will I go back?  Sure when my client is staying at the Venetian or Palazzo perhaps. It's not too convenient and for locals getting there is a challenge. Del Frisco's or the Golden Steer are much easier to get to and with similar service and food.   Definitely check it out. You won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "Wanting a good steak while in Vegas, we decided to try Delmonico Steakhouse. We parked at the Palazzo ( free valet parking) and walked through the hotel to our destination . We were greeted n seated as soon as we walked in. Our server was very nice. We got waters n popovers ( complimentary) while we looked over the menu for drinks and dinner. The popovers were so light n flaky. I enjoyed them so much that I had two before any food came!!! This may have been a mistake for me since I don't eat much to begin with but they were so good. We got the Parmesan truffle chips to pick on while we had a few drinks. They were deliciously addicting!! Hubby got the rib eye and I got a New York strip with foie gras. Both of our steaks were cooked perfectly to how we asked for it to be!!! My foie gras on the other hand was a little burnt and had that burnt taste that lingered. For our sides we got the garlic mashed potatoes which was very tasty and the creamed spinach which was okay but not better than the one at my favorite place to get creamed spinach.  Although we were both very full and had to get take out boxes, I had to try the banana cream pie!!! It was huge and  very delicious!!! Not overly sweet and full of bananas! I enjoyed it very much!!! Service was good, atmosphere was good, and food was great!",

She treated all her guests with the same attention- very much appreciated. Thanks for a great experience- we will be back .",

It was like they ran out of salt and just didn't tell anyone. The service was great, but wow....what a big miss. Maybe the chef was in a bad mood because he had to work on Christmas. If so....I could taste his tears in my food. But then again....tears are salty and that would add flavor..so...I guess not. Emeril, get your house in order, please.",

    "text": "Previously (about a year ago), we had a good experience at Delmonicos, so we had gone back.  This time around, the experience was a train wreck.  Several of us went (my wife and I had invited extended family), and we decided to order many smaller dishes to share/sample, rather than a whole course each.  As soon as our server noticed that we were not ordering a \"main entree\" we all noticed a HUGE shift in service and attitude.  Suddenly our server had a poor attitude, stopped talking to us, and the level of service went from a 9 to a 2.    What is strange is that we were ordering so many smaller items to be shared, as well as several bottles of pricey wine, that the check would be significant nevertheless, and so if it was the TIP that the server was worried about (and we could tell it was!), then they were pathetic to decide to neglect our entire table for that reason.  To add insult to injury, we had a family member who flew in internationally for her birthday celebration, and this was her dinner.  Delmonico's server either out of neglect, or out of spite, decided to ignore this occasion (even though we had told her in private before we all sat down!) and there was no mention of it, no cake, nothing.  My wife and I travel significantly, and we are huge foodies.  We will spend any amount of money on great food, great service, and great experiences.  We are great tippers, usually tipping 25% or more.  We are embarrassed and ashamed that we invited extended family to be a part of this (supposed) birthday celebration, and that people flew in from out of the country just for this celebration... only for the experience to be subpar and lackluster.  I feel that Delmonico's really dropped the ball on this one.  We are not planning on returning, as there are so many other phenomenal nearby options for great dining experiences, and also great customer service.",

I asked for a medium rare and this thing came out on the bloodier side which I enjoy immensely, but others I was sharing with did not. I even relished chomping on the T-bone at the end, ya know, with the best feminine manners possible. ;) It should be noted that although delicious, the sliced meat did not stay warm for very long. Our friend's bone-in ribeye was also rather cold.  We also went for some sides and shared the cost. I ordered the *Sauteed Garlic Mushrooms* for my share. They give you A LOT and as they should for $14. Among all our sides, the tastiest was the *Creamed Corn Gratinee*. For dessert, we opted out, but the waiters were kind enough to note that there were two February babies at the table and brought out a complimentary dessert with a candle for each of us. It was a simple sorbet with cantaloupe, but definitely a nice touch.   The dessert at the end was icing on the cake, so I will leave them with 4-stars despite our cold steaks. Ambiance was romantic, but you don't necessarily have to dress up to eat here.",

Me and my husband were just walk ins without reservations and they managed to seat us right away. Our dress attire was a little more informal, neither of us had jackets. The other people dining seemed to be more dressy. The atmosphere was upscale.   The food was killer, you are immediately presented with these bread poppers which are too die for.  As a starter we had the Fig Foie Gras, it was salty and sweet and the Foie Gras was cooked perfectly it was a very buttery texture on puff pastry or alike. We also got the stereotypical Caesar salad which was table-side. I'm not going to lie It wasn't the best, I hate to be a stickler but my husband and I often go to steakhouses and this is kind of his staple salad.    For the mains my husband and I both got the bone in Ribeye medium rare, the steak was cooked to perfection See pics**  Sides were cheese mashed potatoes and Mushrooms. Both were very good.    Dessert was killer I MEAN KILLER. You have to get the banana cream cake. It is life changing. I will be back for an awesome steak but the cake is nothing short of perfection. Do yourself a favor and get the banana cream cake.",

I had the beef carpaccio salad my goodness that was so delicious I highly recommend that. 2 bottles of wine, grappa , lattes dessert, various beers and highballs. All the food was great and liquor strong. We were all well dressed business men in suits and dress shirts but man our service was lacking. Renee our bearded server sucked not very friendly, no smiles no hospitality. I had to ask for some more bread 3times before I got any. I will say the other helpers were 100% friendlier and nicer than Renee I wish those ladies were our server. Anyways just disappointed in our server after we spent over 1400 on dinner and drinks. If you go the food is great request a different server Renee's hospitality sucks",

The service has always been consistently great-call you by name, never a water glass left half full, and servers who know and understand the menu.  The food, well, that's what really keeps us going back.  Last visit, we had the Chateaubriand for 2-it was perfect.  The sides that came with were delicious and we had the beer/cheese dip with pretzel bread for a starter and it was heaven in a bowl.  I like the wine selection-our server paired our steak with an appropriate red-not too full, but not too sweet , either.  I also love that they've always sent out an amuse-bouche(a nice, little bite) from the chef before you order-it's the little things that add up! Emeril-you've done it right again!

We were seated promptly but at a table that was less than desirable where the waiter had to stand behind me while serving us. He was quite pushy and brusque. My wife ordered the half duck as she loves duck. Right after we were served the waiter returned and asked if everything was OK, My wife had taken one bite from the duck leg and she said that things were OK. But as she continued to work on the rest of the duck it seemed to become very tough like it had been over microwaived. She signaled the waiter over and rather than handling it professionally he asked in a rather accusing manner why she had said the duck was OK when first asked. This made us feel very uncomfortable. The waiter did remove the duck and did not charge us for it. However, we just wanted some excellent food. I'll never return to any of Emeril's restaurants based on this encounter. If you want a good meal while at the Venetian / Palazzo go to Bouchon where you'll be treated well and the food is great. Just to be balanced I will say that the rib eye that I had was good.",

When I called the woman who answered said no problem. The bartender was exceptional, stearing me towards a good whiskey. Of course the steak itself. To describe the steak would only cheapen the experience. Very worth the money.",

The service was amazing, the food was fantastic..... I am an Emeril fan so I was excited to try it out.  The prices was very reasonable especially for being a top rated Vegas strip restaurant. Excited to try the other locations in NYC and NO now!",

    "text": "I am going to preface this review by saying that we were given free desserts and a special appetizer from the chef. This was due to my sister knowing the general manager as she was a Vegas concierge for many years. That being said, I thought the meal experience was outstanding.  We were celebrating an anniversary and there were seven of us including a 7 year old. The waiter brought the aforementioned free appetizer, a steak and blue cheese  croquette and foie grae with cherry compote. Not bad. I started with the baby greens with fried mozzarella. The lettuce was decent, the mozzarella cold and disappointing.   I asked a waiter, not ours, what she recommends and she said easily the Rib Eye in Bone. It saved the meal. As juicy as any steak I've ever had, and spiced to perfection with a dollop of butter melting on top. My wife enjoyed the 2 pound lobster and had started with the Lobster Bisque which she also devoured. The sides were OK. I had the Twice Baked potato with bacon and cheese, but also sampled the french fries, which they specially made for the 7 year old, and they were quite good.  Dessert, since it was free, was a virtual sampler platter. The pecan pie was excellent. The bread pudding was disapponting - I've never tried it with cubed up bread with sauce on top and not enough to reach the bottom and served with Oreo ice cream and chocolate Magic Shell. I sampled three flavors of ice cream and gelato and disliked them all, they tasted like ice milk.  The service was impeccable. Never a want. And the price was not bad, $325 for 7 people but if I included the freebies then it would have touched $400. Bottom line is I'd go back if staying at the Venetian but would try others if not.",

Pretty much every time I visit Vegas; we find a way to to have dinner there. I have tried the pork chops for dinner. But my \"go to\" entree is ALWAYS the RIB EYE. It is done to PERFECTION. Always EXPERTLY cooked and seasoned. TENDER and almost MELTS IN YOUR MOUTH. The sign of an EXCELLENT STEAKHOUSE - is that your steak is ALWAYS cooked to order and does not need much in the area of extra sauces. Your steak comes with an assortment of Emeril's sauces. I have never needed them and prefer to eat the steak \"as is\". Service is IMPECCABLE. Your drinks are brought quickly. Your water glass is never empty. Entrees and side dishes are delectable beyond your dreams. Also, the most AMAZING Banana Cream Pie I have ever had the pleasure of eating in my Life. TRUST ME. Spending money at Delmonico Steakhouse is WELL SPENT and I doubt you will be disappointed. It is a True dining EXPERIENCE.",

All sides we ordered were great and I think we ordered every side on the menu, you must get truffle and parmesan chips!  The service is incredible, a completely orchestrated dinner service is always impressive when your at a table of 9 and each plate hits the table at the same time.  Servers/staff are watching every movement and are very good at anticipating needs and requests.  The dining room has a modern minimalist look but very nice, you dont hear this much but the tables and chairs were really nice.  When in Vegas make sure you go to Delmonico.",

It may have been the atmosphere.  Everything seemed very bland and sort of old - for instance, the leather dining chairs all had cracks and chips in them, which isn't what I expect from a place of this caliber.  I guess it just wasn't a very special experience.",

The steaks were a lot bigger than expected and we had to ask for doggie boxes. (We finished it off the next day!) Great wine selection. Great service.  My only complaint is the table are too close together and if the people next to you do not bump you, the waiter does as he passes between tables. That was a real pain. They need to rearrange the seating. Ask for a corner table to avoid this problem. If they fix that, I would give them five stars.",

We started off with a few appetizers including the calamari which was a little on the salty side, roasted butternut squash ravioli with duck and the crab cakes.   I had the spinach and radicchio salad with apple rosemary vinaigrette and warm pistachio crusted goat cheesecake. Yep, that's right, you heard me... a goat cheese cake. It was fantastic.   For my entree I was worried because I had already filled up on the appetizers and my delicious salad but I managed to eat my Filet Mignon medallions with a bacon peppercorn sauce.  We split a few sides as a table including the broccoli, asparagus and some delicious corn dish. I have no idea who ordered it but for the love of all that is holy, you have to get this corn dish. It was phenomenal. The broccoli not so much... too al dente for me!  For dessert there were a few orders of the bread pudding and banana cream pie which no one seemed to complain about. The service was a little slow but maybe it was because the place was packed. There was way too much time in between courses. Oh and it took at least 30 minutes to get drinks each round. Maybe go early before the rush hits or just don't go with a party of 13 like we did.",

The ambiance is nice although the decor is a bit spartan, the wine list is far more than my gin-drinking brain could ever comprehend, and to top it all off the service was on another level:  There were like three dudes running around bringing us stuff and clearing plates all night.  And you wanna know about attention to detail?  The one thing Vegas has heretofore *never* gotten right was the after-dinner espresso.  Never hot enough, or no head of crema, or just awful tasting.  But Delmonico's brew was not only good tasting, but they actually warmed up the cup!  (The coffee snobs among you will know what I'm on about here.)",

A buddy of mine shared his bone-in Ribeye, medium rare, and it was done perfectly.  Firm, but marbled and juicy.  I ate the lobster tail which must have weighed a pound.

    "text": "Steak! My first trip to Vegas was this past summer with a group of friends. We ate here one night and it's the best steak I have every had in my life. I started with the lobster bisque and for dinner had the boneless ribeye medium rare with a bunch of different sides for the table, no room for desert though. Also two of my friends ordered the Caesar Salad which they make table side (for two people).    Lobster bisque... very very tasty and rich. If you don't like rich foods then you should not order this. It also has nice size chunks of lobster in it.   Boneless ribeye, medium rare...Amazing. It was cooked to perfection, just the way medium rare should be. It was well cooked and well seasoned, there's no need to dip it in ketchup or steak sauce. It was a pretty decent size cut of meat too, I can't remember the ounces but I left stuffed.   Caesar salad...I'm not a fan of rabbit food but watching the person make it table side it looked really good. In a matter of about 5-8 minutes he made two servings of what I was told was the best Caesar salad ever,  At this restaurant, the steak doesn't come with anything, you have to order the sides separately, I think we ordered asparagus, wild sauteed wild mushrooms and twice baked potato. All was cooked to perfection.   The Service...it was the outstanding. There are three people per table, so you are always attended to and the waiter is well versed in the menu and the drinks. I wasn't too sure what I wanted so I asked him for a recommendation and he asked me a few questions and based on those answers brought a drink out, which was good. I can't remember the name but it was good. I think it had 3 different kinds of liquor in it but it didn't taste like it at all, not overwhelming, good blend, good bartender.   It is expensive but well worth the money. The food, the service, the atmosphere and best of all since it is Vegas no need to really dress up, my kind of place. Definitely have to go there again when I go back during Christmas.",

The ambiance was fantastic and maybe I enjoyed myself so much because we went here with a group of 18 or so right after my husband and I got married in the Venetian but here's the breakdown.   The appitizers were really great, the parmesan chips were thin and had wonderful flavor. We talked about stealing a basket as we left. The bbq shrimp was done perfectly and a great twist.   My brother had the soft shell crab and that may have been my favorite thing I had. It was fantastic but I don't have much comparison since that was actually the first time I've had soft shell crab. Nevertheless, it had great flavor and I would order it again. My husband and I split a steak and got the cesear salad. The salad was really nice and fresh. The steak was great, and probably in the top 3 I have ever had.   We had a bunch of wine and tried a few different kinds and they were all great. The manager came over and talked to us about the wines and was very informative and nice.   The reason why this didn't get 5 stars from me was because for the price, you just expect a little more from the steaks. This was still one of the best dinners I have ever had and I would absolutely go back.",

YES, there were amazing left overs!  For dessert of course it was the White Chocolate Macadamia nut Bread Pudding! If anyone knows Emril's shows or books you know this is like his signature item. I have also had the Duck Egg Creme Brulee which is heavenly as well. But my go to is the bread pudding!  This is a place you probably wouldn't wanna eat at daily, but it is a place to take special friends who enjoy good food at it's best or for an awesome night of self spoiling! :)  *Lobster bique, the butternut squash ravioli and the fried chicken are killer too!",

    "text": "I have eaten at this restaurant twice. The first meal was memorable and I never forgot it. As a result, I was so excited to go back last week. I had the truffle chips for an appetizer which were good but they didn't fit in with that kind of restaurant. My friend had a shrimp appetizer that was the favorite of the waiter's but we both found it very strange. It was supposed to be something creole and the shrimp was covered with an unattractive brown sauce. Odd.  We both had a filet mignon. I ordered mine medium rare. I couldn't finish the last 15% of it because it was rare. Disgusting. It was fine but not worth $50. It came with a  sauce that made it delicious though. Without the sauce it would have been a big disappointment.  We ordered a side of double baked potatoes. That was the best part of the meal.  We each ordered a dessert. I had the banana cream pie. It was gorgeous but it was all bananas (which I LOVE) but with little cream. It was fine. My friend had the creme brulee and it was delicious.  Service was very nice. Overall at $312 I won't be going back simply because it isn't worth the money.",

Deserts were off the chart, an indulgence for all  Cons: 1. Lamb from Colorado was OK, not great it was medium cooked, so it was a little chewy since I prefer medium rare. 2. Really none   I recommend it highly. Damage was reasonable, we will be back!",

Though it doesn't come with a view (like most of the nice restaurants in Vegas), but the settings, decorations alone are very nice.  A romantic get-away with very very nice food - from the perfectly seasoned steaks, their special steak sauces, each one of its side dishes, even the bread (the butter! yum!)...  They have its own wine celler, and their wine list is prob. the best I see in LV.  Been there a couple times and will definitely go back again - when I have a little extra cash... :)",

The only real difference was that Delmonico cooked my NY Strip perfectly medium rare vs. just a bit over at Puck's place.  The rest of the meal from service to apps to salads was first rate.  The gumbo was yummy with a dark brick roux used and plenty of chicken, seafood and andouille to complement.  They put a big ole hunk of Maitre d butter on each steak and this, along with the Cajun seasoning (am assuming Emeril's trademark Essence) and the natural juices from the prime, aged beef lead to a wonderful liquid on your plate for dipping each tender bite.  Service was as attentive and on point as one would expect at these prices.  Sorry Wolfgang, Emeril wins this showdown by .5 of a star!",

    "text": "The food was average at best.  The exceptionally high prices and the quality of the dishes do not match up.  Wife and I chose Delmonico based on reviews.  We left disappointed. The service is what you would expect to find at any high end restaurant.  All of our dishes lacked flavor and the quality of the ingredients were not there as well.  I am really not sure how this place is so well reviewed.  Coming from Boston we could go out every night for three months for a fantastic dinner and never revisit the same restaurant.  With that maybe we are spoiled.  Our bill for the two of us at the end of the night was $250.  Being generous I would say that dinner was worth maybe a third of the cost.    The next night we sat at the bar at Seablue in the MGM for a couple of cocktails. I got talking with the bartender and told him about dinner the previous night.  He said \"ooh, I wouldn't go there.  I was there years ago and found it to be extremely overpriced and the food just not that good.  I've heard lots of people say not great things about their Delmonico visit.\" Coincidentally, if you are in the MGM during happy hour visit the Seablue. Shrimp Cocktail are $1 each and are huge.  Coming from the east coast I wouldn't eat shrimp in the desert but on the bartenders recommendation we got some. They were excellent.  If the restaurant wasn't in the Venetian and visited by thousands of tourists I would guess it would go out of business rather quickly.",

Now, in all honesty, I wasn't my normal foodie self, I wasn't really that hungry, so maybe I'm not giving it a fair review....but.... We arrived 5 minutes late for our reservation, and were greeted by the host with a little attitude, but in all fairness, I was in heels hiking miles to get to this place, give me a break! After he made a point of stating the time, and the time our reservation was, we were escorted to our table. The decor almost feels cave-like, which worked for a steakhouse. The place was packed and it took a little longer than fine dining protocol allows for to get our menus. Our waitress was a sweetheart and made suggestions for us, although she seemed swamped with tables.  I decided on the lobster bisque and the petite fillet Mignon. The lobster bisque was ok, nothing special, which was sad, since I watch the food network 24/7 and love Emeril, (I expected more from his restaurant). My fillet was a little overcooked for medium rare, and really had nothing special about it. No flavor to set it apart from a fillet I'd get from Costco and make on the grill myself. The boy loved his steak, so I guess the meal was a success, but having been to N9NE, I wouldn't come back here. The prices are high, and the food is just good, not world changing like Vegas fine dining should be.",

    "text": "we got here at 730pm with reservations at 8pm, so we waited for a little bit in their \"lounge.\" here, i asked for water, and the waitress gracefully brought me a glass, even though we were probably expected to order an alcoholic beverage. we waited about 15 minutes in their lounge, and then a waitress took us to our seats. the restaurant was surprisingly large, and we were seated in the middle of the back room. i was surprised at the decor, it was rather.. plain.  plain white walls with dim lighting.. it kind of felt like we were just being seated in a large room. after sitting, the waiter explained to us about the menu, and then left a very large book of alcoholic beverages for us to look over as well.  the menu wasnt too large, which was good for indecisive people like us. :)  to start, we ordered a Lobster Bisque ($12.50) to share, esp after reading the rave reviews about it here. like i said, not hyped. it was sensational. it was so smooth, creamy, and rich, mMm.. i'm drooling right now just thinking about it. for our entrees, i ordered the Colorado Rack of Lamb ($48) with a side of Roasted Fingerling Potatoes ($9), and the friend ordered one of their specials of the night--Blue Cheese covered Bone-in Filet with Bacon ($55) with a side of Sauteed Garlic Mushrooms ($9). i'll start with the sides. the potatoes were okay.. nothing too spectacular.. a little bit on the salty side.. but it was a good side if you need veggies (or veggie-related) along with your meat. the mushrooms were good. tasty, cooked nicely, and i dont even like mushrooms! i ordered the lamb cooked to medium, and it was still slightly too red for me, but it was good nonetheless. a little bit on the fatty side, but it was tasty, and came with a popover.. which is this egg-battered bread thing that went really well with the lamb sauce. i actually had a bite of the friend's steak before i dug into my lamb, and boy.. that steak was FABULOUS! the blue cheese, bacon, steak, and tangy sauce that came with it made the steak utterly orgasmic. perfect blend of flavors. the meat practically melts in your mouth. friend got the steak in medium rare, but it seemed slightly more cooked than it should've been. it definitely didnt take away the tenderness though, this was the best steak i've had in my life (and i only took a couple of bites from it). this was one of the specials though, so it probably wont always be available. just writing about it right now is making my stomach grumble. i was craving to see what their desserts would taste like. we decided to go with the Chocolate Bread Pudding ($10). it was really chocolate-y, but for chocolate-lovers like me, it was perfect. it was the cherry on top of an already great meal.",

It seemed like there were more workers than patrons the night we were there.    Caesar Salad - I was very tempted to order an appetizer, but my gf reminded me we were about to eat over a pound of meat so we decided to share the caesar salad.  It was prepared table side by our waiter.  It was decent and a nice way to prepare my stomach for the main course.  Bone-in Ribeye - Mine was cooked perfectly and well seasoned.  My particular cut was very, very tender.  My gf order the exact same steak and it wasn't nearly as good.  I had to share parts of my steak with her and we took the rest of hers to go.  Hers wasn't bad, it just wasn't as good as mine.    Sides - We ordered the creamed corn and asparagus.   The corn was very good.  It had a nice crust on the top and went well with my steak.  The asparagus was pretty plain.  I had to throw salt and pepper on it otherwise it was completely tasteless.    Dessert - We ordered the banana cream pie.  I have no idea why we chose it, but I'm glad we did.  I would have usually ordered something chocolaty with ice cream but the banana cream pie sounded good.  Well, it was good.  Really good.  When it came out, I thought it was going to be way too sweet with all the caramel and chocolate shavings, but it wasn't.  We weren't even hungry after our meal, but we managed to put the entire dessert down.    Overall, the food was good.  I have to give it 4 stars for the boring asparagus and inconsistent steak.  The wait staff was awesome.  They can have 5 stars.",

The things I loved were the Parmesan chip appetizer, the caesar salad, the soft shell crab and the BBQ shrimp app.  The Caesar salad was probably the best I've ever had.  The chips were thin cut and perfectly crispy.  The BBQ shrimps were cooked just right and the bbq sauce was mild and great for the shrimp.  The crab was excellent - perfectly cooked and had great flavor. I also tried the NY strip, it was cooked correctly and had a nice crust.  It was not the best steak I've ever had, but you can tell it was done with care and quality.  The appetizers were very good because each one had something that made it special...I would like to see that with the steaks as well.  I would say the service is what i was most disappointed in.  Not that it was bad, but it just wasn't what you expect from a place of this caliber (and price).",

    "text": "is it okay not to rave about this place? apologies to emeril. i think you're cool. really, i do.  visited the land of sin about a month ago and went to dinner at Delmonico. i was impressed with the steak, but extremely underwhelmed with the appetizers and sides.  shared a new york strip steak, cooked medium rare, with a friend. de-f'ing-licious. i didn't really like or crave steak until a recent trip to puerto rico (a food story for another time) but now i think i've learned to appreciate the awesomeness of a giant hunk of meat. the waiter was nice enough to split the steak onto two places, and it was sooooo good.  however. the appetizers and sides were another story.  - truffle parmesan potato chips - supposedly a specialty, but i found these too oily (yea yea, i know. truffle oil.) and too rich. - bbq shrimp w/ rosemary biscuit - came with 4 (i think) sizable shrimp, but i found it too salty, and really nothing special. - creamed spinach - very ehhhh. i've had better. - sauteed garlic mushrooms - okay, so you can't go wrong with garlic & mushrooms. these were a bit oily too, but pretty good none-the-less.",

    "text": "We stayed at the Palazzo and wanted to have a nice dinner at one of the restaurants in the hotel. I checked Yelp and found Delmonico had a really good review and made reservations for 9:30pm on Friday. The place was pretty full, with more and more guests still coming in.  Considering the price of the meal and the Yelp description we put on our \"dressy\" clothes. After we were seated a group of 6 came in wearing t-shirts, baseball caps, shorts, and flip flops. Oh well, that's Vegas for you.  Instead of the usual bread basket, the wait staff would place a warm roll on your plate when needed. It was one of the best rolls I've had in a while. A warm soft roll with a sprinkle of salt on top. We ordered for an appetizer, the Ahi Tuna & Salmon Tartare Cucumber Salad and Wasabi Aioli. I thought it was a bit salty, but the bf thought otherwise. We still scarfed it down. Because it was a busy night, we did have to wait a bit between the appetizer and our entrees. But the wait staff was very attentive most other times.   The bf ordered the Filet Mignon. He said it was very tasty and melted in his mouth. I ordered the Roasted Rack of Colorado Lamb, Fresh Herb Popover and Black Truffle Reduction. By far the best lamb I have ever had. Previous times when I ordered lamb, it had a gamey taste. For a second, I thought I was eating filet mignon. The Black Truffle reduction has a nice addition. It did not cover up the taste of the lamb. The popover was light and airy and tasted of rosemary.  We shared the New Orleans Style Creamed Spinach as a side. It was rich, creamy and delicious. I didn't get to finish my cocktail by the end, so the waiter placed it in a \"to-go\" cup. The \"to-go\" cup being a hotel glass.   If I had the money to splurge again, I'd definitely go back.",

I can get a better steak in Houston (where I'm from) at a dozen or more places for half the price.  I'm sure the meat was high quality, and it was cooked properly... but it just wasn't anything special.  Not worthy of the $ anyway.  Service was a bit obsequious as well (which got annoying).  Overall it was a nice dinner, but for not a good value for the $.  There are many steak places in LV now, I'll try something else next time.",

Just a large open room with many tables and many people chatting and laughing. We ordered the bone-in ribeye and it was prepared to perfection, but a tad bit too salty for my friend's taste. I loved mine, but you need to be a full-on caveman to eat the whole damn thing. We had the creamed spinach which was coarse and tough to chew and the au gratin potatoes were really good. The sommelier was great and recommended a very nice blend. We were so stuffed, we chose not to have dessert, but they looked quite good. This is a very nice, fancy steakhouse, but CUT still gets my vote for the best one around.",

    "text": "We went in with high hopes after a friend recommended Delmonico but we left just a bit disappointed.  The ambiance was really nice and we were given a great table without a reservation but the food left a little to be desired.    My friend and I both started with lobster bisque, which was good but a little thin.  We noticed right away too that she had 2 tiny little pieces of lobster in hers, but I had almost an entire small claw.  I was happy until I realized it was tough and rubbery.  I actually had to use a knife and fork to cut it into bite sized pieces.  My husband ordered the wedge salad as a starter and it was 80% white/yellow core.  Not what you would expect in a place as pricey as this.  I ordered the fillet and it was cooked perfectly but it was not a great cut of meat.  Maybe I have high standards, but I think a $30+ fillet should be butter knife soft, but this one was kind of fibrous and hard to cut with a steak knife.  I didn't really care for the seasoning either, but that's a personal preference, not something I can count against the restaurant.  My husband's rib eye was really fatty but he loved his twice baked potato.  I had the corn gratin for my side and it was tasty but again, not my style.    Our server was efficient but pretty standoffish.  When we first sat down, we ordered a bottle of \"Emerel's Blend\" wine and he nicely suggested that we might want to try something else, but other than that, his interaction with us was a bit cold.    Maybe it was an off night, but I really expected more from a $400+ dinner.",

    "text": "I've watched Emeril on the FoodNetwork Channel for years.. I even used to tape his shows through my VCR (yes VHS tapes). I have heard of this place through a friend that told me that everytime his brother goes to Vegas he eats here. So, when I found out that it was Emeril's Restaurant, I was even more eager to try this place! Well, I finally had the chance to experience this restaurant, whose owner is one of the most enthusiastic and giddy chef's around!   I had made reservations a couple hours prior and when we got there we were seated within seconds. Place was pretty occupied with plenty of men dressed in suits, a few couples and  loud crowds that had their drunken voices echoing throughout the restaurant. All the staff members were well postured with every movement from pouring drinks to picking up finished plates off the table. The place is contemporary, a minimalist dream with large and very comfortable dining chairs.  The order:  Vine-Ripened Tomato Salad: Tomatoes were juicy, plump and tasted so fresh. The tomatoes combined with the red onion, fresh mozzarella, extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar = 4.5/5 stars  Lobster Bisque: Wow! I've had this dish a couple other times at other fancy restaurants and this one just blew those away! The flavor of the soup was smooth and had just the right amount of lobster flavor, not rich at all. Came with a few pieces of lobster.. what a tease!   Potato Gratin: came in a mini pan with the whole top completely lightly crusted brown. I grabbed my fork, broke into the soft crust and scooped up bite with a little bit of everything on it (crust,  potato and cheese). One of the better potato side dishes I've ever had!  Creamed Corn Gratinee: also came in a mini pan with a crumble/breaded top layer. The breading went well with the corn but overall it was just good.  Bone In Rib Steak: Server asked me if I wanted Emeril's Essence and slice of butter placed on my steak. I told him that I wanted it the way it should be served.. Shortly, the steak was finally served with a thin slice of butter with the evident Emeril Magic Dust \"BAM!\" sprinkled over  the meat. It was a healthy portion and did look Fantasteak! Not the softest steaks I've had but had a Nice Chew, not the juiciest but was far from dry, overall had a very well rounded quality to it. No Complaints!   Emeril's Banana Cream Pie: Came Tall with layers whip cream, generous amount of banana slices, banana cream and thin crust. There was also chocolate sprinkled/shavings  on top and caramel spread on the bottom. A great way to finish a fine dinner!   *Also had a glass of some French Honey Wine to compliment the pie, it was on the sweeter side but worth trying.  Being A FAN of Emeril For Years, Had High Expectations.. The Place Delivered but Not with Flying Colors..",

Steaks - OK 3 Stars.  The only reason I rated three starts for the review.  If you are a patron of New York steakhouses such as Peter Lugers or S and W,  or excellent national steakhouses such as Shula's, like myself, you may not enjoy the steak cuts.  My New York Strip was fairly tough, and required some heavy cutting considering the $50 price.  If you can't cut a $50med. rare steak with a serrated butter knife, I don't want to eat it.  It probably has some good marbling as it was juicy and moist, but it had some tough fibers that were definitely not meat or bands of marbling.  This may be expected in a ribeye where tendonous material often lines the outer rim of the steak.  Overall, a great dining experience with great service, but 3 stars because of meat cuts.",

However, we were seated kind of in the corner round table which was fine but some of us were facing a glass enclosed small room that had stacks of chairs. What is that room? Was it seriously storage space we were starring at? I didn't expect to see a stack of black chairs in a glass case room throughout my whole dinner from a high end restaurant.   Coming from a delicous dessert finish with Afrogato the night before, I asked the waitress if it could be made. She said sure it could. I was very excited only to realize when the bill came that she charged $8 for a shot of Espresso and $10 for scoop of ice cream. WOW.",

The restaurant we had originally planned to go to that night was completely booked, so based on the great Yelp rating we chose Delmonico's instead.    Prior to our trip, we were so excited to try this place out.  Our reservations were at 8pm and we showed up a few minutes early, expecting the place to be packed.  I should mention that the location is very odd and not easy to find.  However, once we found it we started wondering if we were  in the right place...  Both of us have dined in nice steakhouses many times and expected that familiar 5 star experience.  From the second we walked in the door it was clear that Delmonico's was not that kind of place.  The entrance was very dark - no one was at the hostess stand and the bar/lounge area was completely empty.  The restaurant looked closed.   Then, the hostess showed up with another employee - they finished their casual, not work related, conversation before greeting us.  They looked up our reservation and sat us right away so I was ready to let go of my first impression and enjoy a great meal.  Unfortunately, that was just the start.    The hostess led us into a mostly empty room with very dim lighting.  We thought it was weird but went along with it.  As we sat down, we realized that the only other table in the room was a large party with serval children - who were playing games and watching movies on their iPads! We were shocked that this behavior was allowed in such a place.  We looked into the other dining room which was mostly full and seemed very lively, full of adults.  When our waiter came over we asked to move to that room (pointing out the distractions at the other table), which they accommodated.  Finally in the environment we were hoping for, we felt relieved as our new waiter handed us a wine list.  The waiter brought the wine and as he poured the glasses, he spilled an entire glass in front of me, on the table.  Did he find us a new table? Did he bring a new (full) bottle of wine? No. Instead he picked the glass up and continued pouring and brought a white napkin to place in front of me to cover the wine stained/wet area.  At this point, we considered leaving but it was past 8:30 and we wanted to try the steak, so we stayed.  We ordered the table side Caesar salad and the chateaubriand to split.  The salad was the highlight of the meal - if you go here, make sure to order it.  The steak was ok, slightly undercooked and we have definitely had better.  After the meal, we decided to skip desert here and go upstairs to Otto instead.  I did use the restroom during the meal.  This was another disappointment.  The restrooms are located down a long hallway, which was also where they stored the extra chairs (stacks of them).  You felt like you were in an area of the restaurant that shouldn't be customer facing - cluttered, scuffs all over the walls and baseboards.   Overall, the experience at Delmonico's was anything but 5 star.  With so many wonderful restaurants in vegas at this price point, there is no reason to choose Delmonico's.",

    "text": "Good food, but not what I expected from an Emeril restaurant.  I've been to his restaurants in Miami and New Orleans, and those were both 5-star experiences; however, the food at Delmonico was not as good as my previous experiences.  It was good, just not 5-star good.  I had the rib-eye, which was perfectly cooked.  But the grits left A LOT to be desired, which was disappointing considering that grits is a staple of southern cooking.  The service was good, although the main server seemed a bit distracted at times.  At that price point, my experience is that servers are almost falling all over you.  With all of the wonderful choices of restaurants in Vegas, I think I'll try somewhere different next time.",

    "text": "Perfect service every time! Everything is good and some things great! We were a party of 3 and two ordered ribeyes and I ordered bone in filet. We all ordered the spinach salad. All items are Ordered alacarte but all of the side items are plenty to split 2/3 ways easily. This time we got the corn it is creamy with a tiny kick of chili peppers and a crunch on top of Panko crumbs. The corn is absolutely delicious! The asparagus is just plain steamed asparagus but it is good too. I have had the spinach, the potatoes, the mushrooms, and the grits in the past, all great but this corn was soooo very good. The popovers are served just after drink orders but they are not replenished or served in a basket. Your back up server will just make one round so they are served fresh and warm. If you want more you will have to ask.  This time we were not served a complimentary mini appetizer as we had always been served in the past years. We did see other tables served this though. Perhaps because we delayed our ordering due to waiting on drinks and our conversation time.  Dessert was the pecan pie. This pecan pie is not the icky sweet oozy gooey pie that I am used to. This one is more tart like, not so sweet or gooey st all. The crust is more cookie like. It was good but I would probably not get this again.  We will stick to the delicious duck egg brulee or the banana cream pie next time.",

We started off with drinks at the beautiful bar and made our way to the plush dinning area. I started off with the gumbo which was superb. For dinner what better choice then the dry aged in house ribeye?  For sides we enjoyed garlic mushrooms, asparagus, NOLA creamed spinach and for dessert I savored the a entire Emeril's banana cream pie slice (it was huge and delish). My co worker from Phoenix enjoyed the bone in filet and he ended his meal with  key lime pie which he also raved about.   This was definitely a meal that was memorable and thank you to the entire staff at Delmonico Steakhouse. It's great knowing I can get a solid NOLA influenced meal with having to go to NOLA!",

The heirloom tomato salad was good which isn't saying much, but the steak was underwhelming.  The rack of lamb was probably the best dish we ordered, despite being a steakhouse.   We ordered two bone in rib eyes, a bone in New York strip, and a rack of lamb. The steaks were under seasoned and lacked that beefy flavor you'd expect from a steak.  We were told that the steaks were wet aged then dry aged, but couldn't taste any of that nuttiness that comes from dry aging. The meat was tender, but didn't have much else going for it.   We've eaten a handful of Emeril Lagasse's restaurants before, but this one really missed the mark.",

Ambiance is very classy and  slightly dim which is perfect.  Dress to impress!  Appetizer  BBQ Shrimp - these were super tasty with Cajun spices and the shrimp sit it a nice broth. Shrimps were cooked perfectly.  Meals: Filet Mignon-cooked and seasoned perfectly juicy and full of flavor.  Good crust on the outside.   Rack of Lamb- very disappointing,  I've ordered lamb at other top restaurants with no problems but this one has way too much fat the first 3 pieces I cut were 85% fat.  I was a little bummed and I hardly ever mention dissatisfaction or send a plate back but my gf urged me since we are paying top $$ for our meals.   Without hesitation after mentioning how the lamb was not up to par the manager. immediately came out inspected the lamb and agreed it was more fatty then usual and allowed me to swap out my lamb with a bone in NY Strip.  The strip was cooked beautifully! Good crust on the outside and perfect medium rare on inside not to mention flavor was om point.  Sides: (here's where I knock down a star) Creamed spinach- was good but not great it lacked a little bit of flavor and a bit bland.   Au Gratin- see above with creamed spinach.  It lacked that wow factor and was a little runny.   Despite the sub par sides the filet and NY strip were both excellent and the impeccable service makes me give 4 stars.   Cheers   PS cocktails were good a little on the strong side which I like but not too strong to make you cringe,  good flavor.",

It started with the cocktail waitress who was so sassy it became bitchy, snipping short responses when our client asked a question. Then came our dinner server who was borderline rude. \"Are your seafood options listed here the only meat-free options you have? Most of them have sausage or some sort of meat in them,\" I inquired. \"Yep,\" was all he said before moving on... didn't even offer to remove an ingredient or help me out in any way.  The food was pretty tasteless. An heirloom tomato salad had the most bang for the appetizer buck, but at $18 for four slices of tomato and a splooge of burrata, I could concoct a very similar version from my local farmer's market for a fraction of the price. And it's not that price is that huge of a factor here; if you're going to Delmonico you are aware of the beefy tab that will come at the end of your meal... but when the service spits you aside, it's not worth it.  If you're wondering why two stars and not one - the second star is for the wine list, which shone brighter than the boring white walls inside this sub-standard steak joint.",

    "text": "We had dinner reservations to celebrate a special event. We started off with a few drinks.  Fried Soft-Shell Crab: An appetizer with poached egg, frisee salad and lemon truffle vinaigrette. Lightly breaded and fried. Not greasy, not fatty and the shell was definitely soft. The citrusy salad compliments the dish. One of the best soft-shell crab versions I've had. We got 2 orders of these - they were that good. 5/5  Filet Mignon: Since I'm not a fan of animal fat, this is what I normally get. Some people may find it boring but I like my steak simple and lean. Very tender and cooked to a perfect medium-rare. This piece of meat didn't photograph very well since it looks so dark from all the pepper but it tasted good. 4/5  Chateaubriand: The second most tender and lean cut of meat. We got mashed potatoes and asparagus on the side. 4/5  Bone-In Ribeye: Dry-aged prime with butter on top. Superb! 4/5  Foie Gras: This was a side item. Perfectly seared and mildly sweet. You don't really need to do much to make foie gras taste good. KISS (keep it simple, stupid!) 4.5/5  Mushrooms with Garlic: This side was really good. I love mushrooms and garlic. The mushrooms did not have just a hint of garlic. They were deliciously garlicky. 5/5  Grits: This has bacon and good melted cheese which makes this more interesting than it should be. I wouldn't normally eat grits but this was good. 4/5  Creme Brulee: I've been feeling tired of this dessert. I didn't find joy in eating this. Plain, ordinary and too safe. 2/5  Delmonico Coquetel: Gin, sparkling dessert wine, five spice-infused simple syrup, ruby red grapefruit and lime juices. Their signature cocktail...but why? Our server was right, I should've not wasted my time on this. It was too sweet and it just didn't taste right. I took a few sips and our server knew it was time for a different drink. 2/5  A Tale of Two Cities: Cherry vodka, elderflower liqueur, black cherry juice and citrus juices. This was deliciously amazing if you like cherry. 5/5  Another drink we had was a martini with bleu cheese-stuffed olives. Since I'm not a fan of martini, olives or bleu cheese - it would not be fair for me to rate this. We got a free chocolate gelato and it was good. Service was good. Our server gave us recommendations and what to stay away from. Honesty is always appreciated.",

They also do tastings if arranged ahead of time of off-menu items such as stuffed quail or other dishes. Highly recommended....you won't be disappointed.",

One complaint (and it almost made us not want to keep our reservation): The hostess \"Claudette\" was very abrupt and discourteous to my mother who has a little bit of hearing loss.

We shared a creamed corn side dish that we both loved. My steak was a little on the tough side but the wait staff and manager were very attentive and took care of the issue.

We ate at the bar and watched some of the New Year's Eve college football game.  I think the volume was on the TV but we really couldn't hear it, hopefully other times they just have some music playing.  I was kind of mixed on the food. The French Onion Soup is a must try! The broth was so deep and rich that you could taste the hours of preparation and simmering. The Tomato and Burrata dish was fine, as was the Ribeye Steak we ordered. Again, not bad, just ok when I compare them to their competitors in the hotel, like Carnavino or Bouchon where we often go for lunch.  We will have to try dinner next time but if you are going don't miss the onion soup!",

    "text": "All the years we've been staying at the Palazzo, and we finally make it to Delmonico! Sort of. For our personal experience, maybe 3.5 stars, but I'd go back, as I think some things were specific to our visit and I think the restaurant can do better.   Jim G. and I stopped in at the bar for a spot of lunch. The bartender was often friendly, but sometimes seemed a bit confused or overwhelmed.  Turned out, he was new. Some of that is forgivable, but it wasn't busy at the bar, so some of it suggests that he's maybe not the best bartender in general.  Perhaps he was having an off day.    The cocktails were interesting and well-crafted but, in some cases (like the Bronte Sisters), the focus seemed so much on presentation that the actual drink part of the drink was missing. The full copper mug of crushed ice left me with a tiny, tiny drink for $16. The wine list is incredibly extensive and led me to a surprising error.  The way it's printed, it sometimes leads the eye to the wrong price, as the name of the wine and the price don't visually seem to be on the same line.  The wine we ordered was great, as I knew it would be, but it was not at the great price I thought it was. Nice surprise for us on the bill when it was 2.5x more! Technically, not their fault, but it feels like it wasn't an accident on their part. It was lunch; not like I already had been drinking!  Onion soup was awesome! Get some, for real! Very dark roux, super flavorful cheese. We shared a steak which was not quite the size our bartender told us it would be (ounces aren't on the menu) but was prepared nicely. The steaks (all except Wagyu) are prepared cajun style, so expect a different flavor profile than your traditional steak.   Good food, but the bar needs more energy (maybe a bit of music?) and a bit of tweaking with the bartender. Maybe an evening trip will do the place more justice.",

I really liked the spinach & frisee salad, tuna & salmon tartare, and the creme brulee was very good. The raspberry sorbet was bland and didn't taste that flavorful.",

    "text": "What better way to celebrate a big 3-0 than with a mean piece of steak! It was my good friend's birthday and we had two tables reserved for our big group. I must say, service was stellar. Staff was knowledgeable with their menu and very patient with us when placing our orders in as we were all quite indecisive and had so many questions.     Starting off with some bread and aperitif, I chose a glass of Blue label Chimay as my poison. Ahhhh...a wonderful prelude to an evening of indulgence. For appetizers, I had their OYSTER ROCKEFELLER. This baked aphrodisiac was not as cheesy as I hoped it would be but they were fresh and of good quality. I can't complain.   Next came the main show, BONE-IN RIBEYE which my man and I split. Split plating was beautifully done with the perfect portion for each of us. No fee for split plate, thank you. I like my meat cooked medium and it came as pink as I expected it to be. A dollop of butter topped off my steak but that for me was unnecessary. It had quite a chew to it which was unlikely coming from Chef Emeril Lagasse's kitchen. Did it taste bad? No, not at all. I just think that being in Vegas where you are surrounded by a plethora of dining options of the same caliber, you need to live up to your name. Sadly, I wasn't as impressed by this dish compared to other fellow Yelpers.   My side of choice was the CREAMED SPINACH. Now we're talking! It tasted sensational with that silky feel of butter and cream. Finally, Chef Emeril's True colors are coming out. And on a sweet note, we ended the evening with EMERIL'S BANANA CREAM PIE. Can I say, WOW!? I will have to say this was the best banana cream pie I've had to date. Hats off to you, Chef! This my friends, earned Delmonico Steakhouse the 4 stars I'm giving them.   Would I come back? Sure! I'll skip the steak and try his southern specialties instead. But more importantly, I shall not forget EMERIL'S BANANA CREAM PIE. It's to die for!",

The Kansas City cut (bone-in NY Strip) here is just so unbelievably perfect.  It is seared on the outside with a beautiful medium rare on the inside.  The texture is perfect.  The juiciness of the meat is perfect.  The salty flavor addition from the bone is perfect.  And what really made it for me was the seasoning on the steak itself.  Every bite had a little peppery bite that was the perfect combination of dancing around the edges of your tongue without being overbearing.  Yes.  A confluence of the perfection of all the individual elements that matter yields the distinction of Best Steak I Have Ever Had.",

    "text": "Five star food. The service? Not so much.   While in Vegas, my boyfriend and I decided it was time to splurge a bit and eat some tasty, tasty cow. We were seeing Blue Man Group that night, and this place was located right next to the theatre. And it's an Emeril restaurant. Awesome, right?  We were seated promptly for our 830 reservation. I sat down and the guy put my napkin on my lap and stepped on my foot in the process. No big deal; I'm a klutz too. Shortly thereafter, a waiter appeared, informed us that we'd have three servers that night. He then asked us if we'd like bottled or tap water, and then asked if we wanted a wine list. We answered and he went off to take care of it. Not 30 seconds later someone else (one of our other servers, I assume) showed up and gave us the exact same spiel. We answered the same way.   Soon after, the first guy appeared with the wine list, which was literally 25 pages long. Ok, I both love me some wine and understand that this is a nice place, but a wine list that long is overwhelming. Yes, they had a page with Kevin's (the sommelier, I assume) picks, but still.   20 minutes after we received the wine list, our server finally showed up to take our wine and food orders. We decided to split a ribeye and some potato gratin. I also got the gumbo, which was served promptly along with our wine.   As I said before, everything was delicious. The wine was great, the gumbo was extremely flavorful, the ribeye was tender and wonderful, and I also loved the potato gratin. However, when we got our food, I asked the server if he could give us the check a little early so we wouldn't have to rush to make our show (we were cutting it close, especially with the time it took for the server to come take our order). He insisted we'd have plenty of time and refused to give us the check. This is because he wanted to offer us dessert after our meal. Fine. Whatever. Still annoying.   I'm hoping that this was just an off night, because it seems that most of the reviews here are very complimentary of the service. I'd be willing to give this place another shot, because the food was really that good (and actually kind of reasonably priced for what you get if you split a steak like we did).   So, we'll see...",

Our waiter recommended the bone in rib eye which is aged and is their signature plate, and the mashed potatoes. This steak was the best!!! I could not believe how good it was. It was seared and just so good. One order of mashed potatoes is really big so our waiter recommended we shared. We did not even finish that 1 order of tasty mashed potatoes.

Each steak ran between $45-55 a la carte, which isn't that extraordinary considering it was a Saturday night in Las Vegas.   I had the bone-in rib eye, which was HUGE. Sadly, I couldn't finish it, which is pretty extraordinary for me. We all ordered several sides (potato gratin, asparagus, baked potatoes, etc), each of which cost $9.   Aside from the monstrously huge (and tasty!) portions, I think the most memorable feature of Delmonico's was the ambiance and atmosphere.

I love being critical, what can I say. But, as much as it pains me to say this, I didn't find one thing I hated about Delmonico Steakhouse. (ARGH!!)  The lobster bisque. Excellent. Best lobster bisque I've ever had in my life. Hands down. Add a little bit of cracked pepper on top and you have a wonderful tasting starter complete with its generous portion of lobster meat. I should've asked for a second order of it.  My ribeye was perfectly cooked and flavorful. Ribeye is usually a cut of meat with a good amount of fat on it. My ribeye had the perfect balance of meat and fat. Fat means flavor, people! I was glad I didn't have to cut off too much of it from my meat. We ordered a side of roasted fingerling potatoes (w/ whole garlic and fresh herbs) and buttered fresh broccoli. These sides complimented my ribeye very well, but I'm being a little biased here because broccoli and fingerling potatoes are my favorite veggies (#1 and #2, respectively). I couldn't finish the massive 16 oz. piece of meat and the sides, so I took them all to go. I wound up eating the rest of it for breakfast the next morning. Can you say best breakfast ever? Yes.  Apart from a patron at the restaurant that was loud and sounded like Mr. Krabs from Spongebob Squarepants, my dining experience here was top notch!

We did not make a reservation for the 4 of us, but the maitre' d Marty put a table together for us in about a 5 min wait. The place was packed! I guess it's the perk of being with \"high rollers\" aka \"corporate cocks\". No, but seriously we had unbelievable service thanks to Marty's personal touch & our beautiful hostess Corrine.  Our C.C's did the pleasure of doing the ordering for us ladies. I must give my C.C's credit because these 2 men had great taste! We started with a very nice bottle of Pinot Noir, Emeril's New Orleans Barbecue Shrimp, Truffle Parmesan Potato Chips, Lobster Bisque, a really good salad that was not on the menu per the request of my C.C friend Richard. The lobster bisque was interesting, the chef bakes the lobster into a tasty biscuit that you can dip or crumble into the creamy bisque.  We also had Butternut Squash Ravioli both dishes brought me back to Delmonico's for 2nd's on Sunday night. Again, I was lucky enough to have Corrine as my hostess the 2nd time around. Thanks Corrine : ) Our main course we had a very fine bottle of Cabernet not on the wine list but one of our Maitre' d Marty's personal fav's! We each had the Bone In Ribeye Steak's they were huge!! Gigantor!!!  I ate maybe a 1/4 of it!!  To compliment our BIG juicy rib eyes we had Vegetables of the Day & New Orleans Creamed Spinach. D'lish! We had sooo much food I thought I was going to burst! All though we were all stuffed some how we managed to end our meal with some coffee & dessert's,  Emeril's Banana Cream Pie (my personal fav. FYI I love cream pies ; p) & Chocolate Peanut Butter Torte. So sinful..... but not as sinful as two women in vegas baby!!  What happens in Vegas stay's in Vegas!!! Let's just say our date's were not cheap and our bill was not small $$$$.",

    "text": "Located on Restaurant Row in the Venetian is Delmonico's Steakhouse. This place is nice, very nice. The lounge area was spacious, plentiful amount of seating, with a bar area. Not a bad place to hang out if there is a wait for your table. You are not able to see inside the restaurant from the lounge area.   We had a table of 13 and we were separated into 2 tables. The seats were very very comfortable. I believe they do accommodate large parties all in one table, but I guess for that time slot on that day, this was our only choice. Reservations are highly recommended here and book in advance if you have a large party.   Our waiter or host shall I call him was very informative about just about everything! He recommended what was the best things on the menu, where to party after dinner, what wines were great, along with how I should get my steak cooked! He was simply awesome.   I order the BONE IN RIB STEAK which is also originally what the server recommended. The price for a good steak does not come cheap, this one was worth all $52.00. Medium rare was perfect. The steak is huge it almost took up the whole entire plate, tender, moist, juicy, perfect temperature, minimal fat, butter came on top of the steak like a pancake, very easy to cut, bone was just this big straight across: ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  so it was very easy to get every last piece off the bone.   I strongly suggest you order the steak with a nice red wine. Your taste buds will be in heaven.   The sides are a bit deceiving if you look at the pictures of the sides. For some reason I was expecting a huge pot, but dont let the pictures fool you! The side order of sauteed mushrooms was very delicious. I put that to the side because I did not want to share with anyone. The truffle potato chips was very greasy, save your $10 and order another side instead.   The calamari was okay. Not worth the $14. Marinara sauce came on top of the calamari already, so if you did not eat it fast enough, it could get soggy real quickly.   THEY HAVE THE BEST WARM BREAD HERE EVER! TEST YOURSELF AND SEE IF YOU CAN RESIST JUST ONE!   I can finally say I ate at one of Emeril's restaurants! Seeing you on the Food Network making all those different mouth watering dishes is for real! Definitely a must try if you are a steak lover.",

    "text": "I ordered the halibut (as did my cousin) and it was dry. The entire dish had zero flavor until I added salt and pepper (I NEVER salt my food after cooking). The sides we had were good- wild mushrooms and creamed spinach. Our husbands steaks were good but nothing to write home about. Servers were attentive but they get a big zero for 1 reason- we told them our fish was dry in a very nice/hushed manor and they still charged us for it. Our bill was $1500 and they couldn't part with 2 $40 entrees. Wow! We won't be back. There's too much amazing food out there and much classier service.",

The steaks were perfectly cooked and excellent quality. I didn't love the seasonal onions but they were as described and just not cooked to my taste. The desserts were excellent, the creme brulee was perfect. I loved the list of espressos and enjoyed topping off my meal with one. The wine list had moderately priced items and the staff were extremely helpful without being fussy.  This was a great experience and I highly recommend it!",

    "text": "Located in the restaurant/shopping area between the Venetian and Palazzo, this is a great steak place.  Went with a group of friends and we all had 1 thing on our mind.  Steak.    We didn't order any alcohol since we were kind of recovering a bit from the night before.    For appetizers, I had the tuna and salmon tartare which was good.  Bunch of my friends had lobster bisque which was rich but very good as well.  The rolls came with a small amount of butter on them and would taste great in the bisque, I'm sure.  For steaks, everyone went with either the New York or Filet.  I had the filet topped with seared foie gras.  The combination of the two was excellent and very flavorful.  I sadly had to leave some foie gras left over because it was too much.  I tried the New York and that was great as well.    For sides we had the potatoes au gratin asparagus.  I didn't have any of the sides, but everyone seemed pretty pleased with them.  Unfortunately, no dessert really jumped out at me.  Everyone split the banana cream pie, but I passed on that since I'm not a fan of bananas.  Service was great.  It was pretty loud though, so I couldn't really hear 2 of my friends who were across the table.  Overall though, excellent meal.",

    "text": "Delmonico's is easily a 5-star restaurant, but not because there is a famous name (Emeril Lagasse) associated with the restaurant -- but because the food is simply exceptional. This is fine dining without the pretentiousness of stuffy, overpriced, mini-portion restaurants.   We happened to be staying at the Venetian Hotel & Casino and made reservations to Delmonico's, which is on the premises. There was about a 1-minute wait and we were quickly whisked away to a candlelit table. The restaurant itself is very simple yet elegant; nothing over the top, flashy or obnoxious. The lighting is perfect; not too dark and the wait staff is extremely attentive and prompt.  Delmonico's is known for their steak; the bone-in rib eye steak. This slab of meat is prime and comes with a nice price tag. If you're at Delmonico's -- ya might as well go for it, chump!  For starters, I had the Lobster Bisque Soup; thick, creamy and packed with flavor. I absolutely loved it! Best Lobster Bisque I have ever had. It came adorned with a polenta type cake in the middle. I am not sure if it was polenta or dried shrimp cake -  or even bread, but it didn't matter as it all happily made its way down my belly.   We also tried the crab meat cake; fresh chunks of crab atop a puff pastry and dressed with tomatoes, lima beans, asparagus and all sorts of good spring veggies. Amazing!   I decided to try the Rack of Lamb with the Twice Baked Potatoes. Jeff went with the Rib Eye Steak and Baked Potato. The Lamb was head-spinning! Topped with a rich sauce and truffles! Perfectly cooked and moist and tender and gaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh! I can't rave enough. The steak was just as good -- even the fatty pieces were delicious.   The food, the service, the atmosphere, the attention to detail, the $25 corking fee -- all was worth the price. Definitely a place to experience while out in SIN CITY!",

Sent steak back, not cooked as requested. Waited 20 mins for waiter to bring steak back. When plate was returned steak was dry, burned and the items left on dinner plate where ice cold. Husband ate dinner alone while I waited for my $52 steak. An apology was never extended. Dinner was definitely not worth the $200 check. Very Disappointed! Will not recommend to friends or family! Pricey, Poor Quality Steak and Bad service!",

    "text": "Quite delicious! I wouldn't say that this Steakhouse is creative or unique, but what I will say is that it's classic, delicious and savory. The decor is comfortable, quietly & minimally luxurious and the service was very good without being intruding. I was dining with my family (sister, mom, father and my husband Russ).   For an appetizer, I ordered the Lobster Bisque which was very good but not super memorable and for the entree, I ordered the Surf and Turf. Perfection. I found everything to be just as I ordered it and savored every last piece of my meal. We got the Bacon-Cheddar Polenta which was remarkably good and the mashed potatoes (which I didn't try) and also, the creamed spinach. It may not be revolutionary, but Delmonico's does good food just right :D  I wouldn't say that I really \"stepped out of my box\" with what I ordered, but I will say that they have a wonderful wine list, a nice group of people working for them, and tasty food. This is the perfect place to dine with a small group or family where everyone can get something they like. It's more of a safe bet while dining in Vegas - but a good one. It's also located in the Venetian - which is as they say - a \"feast for the eyes\" I like!",

The staff were very friendly, from the hostess stand to our waitress. My wife and I shared the chateaubriand which came with asparagus and frites. All were excellent! This was the most expensive chateaubriand we ever ate, but I expect that premium would be added to a meal served at any restaurant on the strip with a famous head chef/owner.",

Did not get any assistance to make the night special even though the table next to me did with a birthday dessert.... no big deal. We ordered the pan seared foie gras for starters which was amazing and flavorful. We had the creamed spinach which lacked flavor but was not overcooked like most places. Down to business we both ordered bone in aged ribeyes. It was unexpectedly disappointing because I've been to the original delmonico's and was pleased. We ordered the same steak cooked to the same temp(medium well) and the steaks tasted like they were cooked at two completely different restaurants. Tender, cooked to the right temp but my steak had almost no flavor at all it was like i needed my own seasoning rack at the table after i received it. The other ribeye though far from perfect was a lot more tolerable. This was definitely not the experience or steak you would expect to get from a delmonico's or any restaurant with a average bill over 200 dollars. I would probably not return to this location.",

    "text": "One of new favorite spots in Vegas! I can't wait to come back again. My boyfriend and I were in town for some racing at the Las Vegas Motorspeedway. Each night we were in town, we would uber out to the strip for a good dinner. Last Sunday, since it was our last night in Vegas, we decided to splurge and was craving a really good steak.   We called ahead and asked the restaurant if it was ok to be casually dressed since we didn't bring any dressy clothes since we weren't planning on going  anywhere too fancy. The restaurant told us that it was completely fine and to just in.  I was able to make reservations and when we arrived, we were seated instantly. Frank, who I think is the manager, greeted us instantly. He was very professional, positive, with great energy. For sure, my bf and I wanted the rib eye steak and we were having a hard time deciding on what to get for our sides. Frank recommended the creamed corn and the potatoes au gratin. On top of that, he also recommended a great bottle of wine to go with it. We ended up ordering what he recommended to us and were not disappointed at all.  Our steaks were cooked to perfection. The creamed corn had a hint of spice, which I thought were jalapenos, but ended up being pablano peppers. Delicious! And the potato au gratins were to die for and had so much flavor to them. In addition to that, the bottle of wine that we ordered was exactly what we were looking for. To end the night off, we ordered dessert as well and went with the duck egg creme brulee (which was fabulous!) and the butter cake with the caramel (I forgot what it was called).  We would like to thank Frank for the wonderful hospitality and his recommendations as well as the entire staff. Thank you for making our night enjoyable! We will be returning again the next time we are in town for some racing.",

My husband had the Beef Carpaccio which was the best I have ever eaten, and we have had some really good Carpaccio before.  It was a large portion of thinly sliced high quality beef that literally melted in my mouth.  Fresh arugula and Parmesan thinly sliced but what makes this special is the crispy capers.  They add a wonderful texture to each bite.  I will dream about going back for this dish.  Second course we both ordered the Angus Tenderloin Sandwich which is delicious and piled with high with roasted mushrooms.  By this point we were full and could only eat half of it.  We took the rest to go because we wanted to make room for dessert!  3rd course was dessert.  My husband had the Pecan pie which was expertly made.  I had Emeril's Bananna Creme Pie.  Amazing!  Service was exceptional and attentive but not intrusive.  Professionals for sure.  We will be going back for sure.  I highly recommend eating here and take advantage of the lunch special!",

I got banana cream pie and the hubs got the key lime pie. Our server was soooo funny and talked to us like we were all old pals or something. We felt so welcomed by him. I think his name was Clint????? I can't remember but he was so friendly and nice and had some suggestions on the dessert menu. We just got the two treats.

I would probably order this again were it not for the fact that I would want to try more of everything else.  The staff was very good. Courteous. Dressed impeccably  well and very organized. The restaurant itself feels like you're in a private cellar. Linen cloths were very clean and pressed and there is nothing else to distract from the mood set by the place... definitely nothing to distract from the food.  The only reason for the deduction in a star is because I could not get comfortable. While I loved the look of the place, it felt very uptight. So for another guest, they may feel more comfortable than I did and this may not matter at all.   All in all a very good restaurant with solid food.",

    "text": "We were looking for a steak restaurant in Las Vegas and decided to give this place a try as we were staying in Venetian. We made a reservation for 7 pm and we were seated at a table near the back of the restaurant. Service was prompt and attentive. I was expecting the piano and live music to be playing as they had a large lounge area in the front but this was not happening. The restaurant was quite empty. We were celebrating an event and received a handwritten note from the restaurant. Received a tiny amuse bouche cucumber with smoked salmon paste. I was a bit surprised when one server mentioned they would now take away the decoration plates as these were not used for the meal. I would've expected the plates to be placed on top of the charger or decoration plate as they called it. Menu had good selections as expected. We ordered the big eye tuna with caviar, tableside Caesar salad, ribeye steak 16 oz and the Piedmontese filet mignon. Also ordered sides creamed spinach, and Brussels sprouts. I liked the tuna appetizer it was beautifully presented and big chunks of sashimi grade tuna with condiments. Flavor was a little lacking. Our server was fine but I can only describe the feeling as abrupt and brusque and my whole dining experience felt rushed and a bit stressful. As the meal progressed it did not seem to be a relaxing dining experience. The steaks came and were done as expected. Piedmontese filet was seared well and great flavor rosemary and garlic infused. The steak was tender and favourful. No complaints with the other ribeye steak. One thing that stands out is the plates they used. White plates and the sides were all darkened and the China had come off from overuse. I think if I'm going to pay $60 for a steak I'd like to see it served on better quality plates. Cutlery also very basic. The sides were really nothing memorable. Creamed spinach came in a little pot. The Brussels sprouts were supposed to be with bacon in it but there was hardly any flavor and tiny bits of bacon on the bottom. There was no Mac and cheese on the menu which was strange for a steak house. They put together for my little one Alfredo pasta with some cheese. We received a complimentary scoop of ice cream for celebrating our event. Dessert menu did not really entice but we ordered the root beer float. I did not really see the Louisiana influence that was supposedly the theme of this restaurant reflected in the menu or entrees. The restaurant felt like a casual steak place. Overall standard pricey steakhouse in Las Vegas that did not impress me enough.",

We arrived on time but still had to wait about 15 minutes for our table and we sat in the piano Lounge area and had a drink called happily ever after which was appropriate.  When I made the reservation I told them it was our wedding dinner and they gave us a nice table in the corner of the restaurant that was more private. Service was excellent and the food was phenomenal. We ordered Caesar salad for two people which was prepared at the table side. We also ordered Chateaubriand which was cooked to Perfection and just the right portion. The steak was soft and delicious and seasoned just right. There was no need for sauce or anything. We didn't want to eat too much because it was New Year's Eve and we didn't want to get food coma and be able to drink a few cocktails to bring in the New Year. We got our banana cream pie to go so we could eat it after midnight. Not sure how much the dinner was because my husband wouldn't let me see the bill but I'm guessing over $250 but it was worth it. The only super minor critique I could give is that they did not refill our water and they did not clean up the bread crumbs on the table which high-end restaurants seem to do. They were also comments that it was dungeon feeling and needed upgrading which I totally disagreed with. It is classy and more than lived up to my expectations",

We ordered lobster deviled eggs as an appetizer, they were savory and chilled perfectly. As main courses we had the salmon and bone in rib eye steak with potatoes gratin and cream spinach. My salmon was very flavorful and fresh, it wasn't fishy or dry. My husband said his steak was the best he's had, which was a surprise because he's picky about steak. The potatoes gratin were the favorite side as they were cheesy and flavorful. The spinach side was creamy and rich. Dessert was amazing! We shared a piece of banana cream pie, we were both very impressed because it was packed with bananas and topped with caramel sauce, whipped cream, and chocolate. Dessert was the best way to end a very good meal. The food portions are more than enough to fill you up, you will not leave hungry. Our first time visiting was an excellent experience, the staff is very professional and the food is high quality. The food was well worth the money and we will be returning.",

    "text": "Time to splurge and allow yourself to fall into a deep state of pleasure.   After trials with off strip, inexpensive eats, we decided to make this meal a good one and it was definitely good alright.   I don't usually give five stars, but I don't see what holds it back, so here it is.   First, this place is pretty large and accommodates reservations pretty easily. I suppose it's not new and hot, so it's relatively simple to get a table during a desired time.   We had solid service. Everyone was so nice, even after we decline getting wine after many minutes of searching through the list and talking to a sommelier. Yep, we were those people.   We ordered:  the ribeye (25oz) which was split for us two the wilted spinach salad barbecue shrimp appetizer  Roasted fingerling potatoes key lime pie desert.  The wilted salad wasn't wilted bc we asked for the dressing on the side, but it was pretty good. I didn't love it bc of the bacon fat vinaigrette, but the fried egg was an interesting touch. The portion is quite small, so not really that shareable if you're wanting to get some greens in your diet.   The barbecue shrimp was fantastic. It comes at a hefty price of $18 for five shrimp, but it's pretty worth it. The shrimp were juicy and plump and very flavorful. It's more Cajun/new orleans style, so don't think it's some traditional southern sweet BBQ.   The steak was delectable. It had a perfect crisp layer on the outside and a good medium rare redness on the inside. For the most part, it was really a good marbled piece of meat. Even at 12 oz each, I could barely finish it, but I was riding on the potatoes...  Which were pretty bomb too. Steeped with garlic and herbs and butter, these potatoes were cute and perfectly seasoned and cooked. Just soft enough to melt in your mouth but cooked enough to have some of a give when you take your initial bite. Definitely recommend these.   And of course, seriously, the best is for last: the key lime pie. Trust me, I'm not a huge sweet tooth (even though I love love ice cream - it doesn't necessarily mean I love super sweet things!) and I don't often tend to like tart flavor profiles, but this was the damn best key lime pie I've ever had. We were recommended several things like the banana something something and blah blah blah and we both just happened to lock our eyes on the key lime - maybe we needed a refreshing dessert - but it was a good choice. By no means do I not think the others are good too - I bet they are - but this was the best choice for us! It was the right amount of tartness with the sweet (though it was a bit heavy on the sugar for my liking) and the strawberry glaze was so complementary. The crust was buttery and delicious and it all paired so well together! Goodness, the ghrelin hormones are starting to rise and they're making me hungry for this dessert!   Delmonico's is a great steak place, maybe one of the best. Don't hesitate to come here for a satisfying carnivorous meal!",

Now for the food. I know this is a steakhouse and my bone in filet was delicious but, if we ever get back here, I would order the double cut pork chop. Amazing!",

A dinner that easily equals that of a monthly mortgage payment. The atmosphere is amazing, you feel like you have entered a special dining room only celebrities are allowed to know exists. Waiters and waitresses swarm you like flys to honey, never allowing your drink to reach 3/4 full. The menu is amazing, littered with fancy words with French origins, and buzzy trendy words like grass fed and organic. They offer an impressive array of sauces to top your steaks, as well as a long list of sides. The sides are served family style. The Brussel sprouts were ahhhhmazing. The mashed potatoes and mushrooms were average at best. The crab appetizer was over cooked. The chips with trufffle oil were very good. The French onion soup was a disaster. Never have I ever seen French onion soup with so much cheese. Literally we couldn't find soup under the cheese. Once I dug halfway to the hellmouth I did find some broth and 3 small onions. Things went really south when we received our steaks. All steaks weren't cooked to order. All but one was acceptable for the customer. One was ordered medium well and came out medium rare. We did send it back. Not sure what route it took to the kitchen, but what should have taken 5 minutes to up cook a steak that had already been cut in half somehow took long enough for the remaining party to finish their dinner. I'm very sad, it is a good thing I'm headed to the slots, perhaps my night will turn around. I sure hope this isn't a prediction of my slot luck!",

    "text": "What took me so long to dine at this place!   Delmonico definitely is my one of my fav steakhouse in Vegas.  Original plan was going to Harvest in Bellagio however there was an incident on the strip, so here we were, detoured to Caesar Palace.  We were seated quickly on a Friday late night, woohoo, it's gonna be a good night.  I like their menu, it was short and sweet only 2 pages, took us only 2 mins to pick our food.  We had applewood bacon, barbecue shrimp, lobster bisque, gumbo, bone in filet which was the house special of the day and also rack of lambs with chimichurri sauce.    The applewood bacon was indeed a thick cut of pork belly, which was quick greasy, the flavor is good but it was so oily I couldn't have more than one bite, I didn't care much about it.    The star of the night was the barbecue shrimp, highly recommend by the waiter, glad we took his advice, it was so delish! It was not the usual bbq sauce that u had before, this New Orleans style bbq sauce had a little tarted, smoky, spice, touch of sweet. Oh man... I literally licked the plate! Oops ... Not very lady like!   Lobster bisque was another surprise, it was rich and velvety with punch of flavors, came with chunks of lobster meats... It was perfect.  Comparing to the lobster bisque, gumbo was just ok, I was a little disappointed Coz gumbo was such a authentic plate represent Cajun creole cuisine. Besides the saltiness, there's not much flavor on the plate.  Oh yes...",

    "text": "Never get between a girl and her BONE-IN RIBEYE....NEVER!  When deciding on restaurant for my friend's BIG 3-OH B-Day dinner, it was between CUT, N9NE, and Delmonico's. After YELPING and looking over all the menus, Delmonico's was the winner because it was conveniently located in The Venetian (we were staying at the Palazzo), decently priced compared to CUT, and had rave reviews about the bone-in ribeye.   RESERVATIONS:  Making reservations was quick and simple. You can make reservations directly through the restaurant as opposed to The Wynn Restaurants where you have to call their restaurant hotline number and the wait is 20+ minutes.  On Friday, March 4, 2010, our party of 9 arrived around 7:15 PM. As we were escorted to our table, we couldn't help but notice the shape of our table. A round table was connected to a rectangular table which errr, resembled a male part. Don't know if it was intentional since I told them it was my male's friend's b-day party? Anyhow, it made for a good laugh.   FOOD: *Lobster Bisque ($12.50): Rich, velvety smooth with generous chunks of sweet tender lobster equals YUMMYNESS! The only complaint is it was a bit too salty for my taste. Four of my friends also had the bisque and complained about the same thing.  *16 oz Bone-in Ribeye ($52): One word...WOW! The bone-in ribeye, aged for 8 weeks was one the most flavorful steaks I've ever tasted! The ribeye was cooked to a perfect medium rare with nice charred crust and a pink center. You can tell that the marbling slowly melted and basted the meat during the cooking process producing a rich, amazingly tender, and savory cut of meat. Aside from the Kobe from Craftsteak, this is hands-down the best steak ever; and for the price point, you really can't go wrong. If there weren't anyone watching, I would have literally grabbed the ribeye by the bone and gone to town cave-man style--it was THAT good!  *Creamed Spinach ($9): DELISH! The spinach was extremely fresh and maintained a vibrant green in the velvety and savory sauce. It was well-seasoned w/o being too salty and complemented the steak perfectly.   *Creamed Corn Gratinee ($9): OMG good--it tasted like a mac & cheese made with corn. The creamed corn was sweet and tender and was topped with a panko breadcrumb crust which gave a nice crunch to the dish. It was an explosion of flavor and texture combos in your mouth...sweet, savory, buttery, and crunchy.  SERVICE: Impeccable service, although a little pretentious at times. I guess you would expect nothing less from an upscale restaurant like Delmonico's. When it came down to serving our entrees, it was like a symphony as the waiters/waitresses served our dishes in-synch with one another to create a \"ta-daa\" moment.  I would have given Delmonico's a 4.5 star rating, however, they allowed Freed's to deliver a b-day cake and didn't charge a slicing fee.  AMBIANCE/DECOR:  Normally steakhouses have a very \"dark\" ambiance. However, Delmonico's was the complete opposite. It was well-lit with Ivory walls and ceilings with accent cobblestone walls, crisp white linens and chestnut furniture created a very simple, yet elegant feel.  I'm ALL about splurging when on vacation. Go big OR go home right? And, when you're in Vegas, you definitely have to go BIG--so, what are you waiting for? Go on and get your Bone-In Ribeye ON!",

She was confused and asked for a napkin and they said oh, we're grabbing you a black one. Just so that she didn't get white threads on her skirt...   The lobster bisque is AMAZING - best I've had, anywhere EVER. The bread is also crazy delicious! It's these weird puffy rolls that are so flaky and good.   I had filet which is normally excellent. I did have one time where for some reason mine was medium and my friend's was medium rare, though we had ordered opposite. We didn't care much though and just switched our steaks :-)  I think they confused the orders in the kitchen.   The service is great - we had Michael Jackson (for real, that was his name) last night and he was super helpful and friendly.   Oh yeah and the bread pudding. OMG...   For the lobster bisque, the bread and bread pudding (plus service) I would give it five starts. The four is because though the steaks are good, I have admittedly had many that are much better. I would still absolutely go back (and really enjoy it) I just can't say it's a \"to die for\" steak.",

We don't get there as often as we would like but will definately return when in town and we will recommend Delmonico to all our friends & family. Emeril, you are blessed to have such wonderful employees. God bless.",

The only reason for not giving the restaurant a five star rating was the noise level. We arrived about 9:30 pm and it was a Friday night and there were many bachelor party tables.

I wasn't impressed by their BBQ shrimp which was highly recommended as their signature appetizer.  Fish was cooked perfectly but most of the food only had 2 dimensions.  I expected more complexity and excitement in their flavors. Overall great for a cocktail and a good meal but Las Vegas has so many places in this category. I would love a large well known restaurant on the strip to go above and beyond.   If you aren't adventurous and just want a good meal with all your great basics on the menu this is perfect. It's a crowd pleaser but definitely lacking in excitement.   If I were to rate the food it would only be 3 stars but the service is very good so I gave them 4 stars. I will be back for drinks but it wouldn't be my first choice for food.",

    "text": "How does one spell grossly overrated...Delmonico's!!! First, I have seen more originality in a Denny's restaurant in terms of decor. This place is as boring to the eye as watching paint dry...that should have been my clue to exit right!!! There is no color, no cool lighting, no cool art, no great looking floors...nope, a two year old could have designed a more interesting restaurant.  Now let's talk food. It is 3am and I'm on the toilet, let's start there!!! They hand me a steak they claim is prime beef. The only thing prime was the price...52 bucks! The meat was not only tough, but like the decor, it had no taste...NONE. Cosco has better steaks then that thing they brought me.   So they do take it back a I ordered rack of lamb for, yes, 55 bucks!!! Now those little four rib racks were excellent...but not 55 bucks worth of excellence.  Where's the MEAT!   Then it is time to go to the bathroom...you won't believe it...a dirty, filthy two stall bathroom!!! And the road to the bathroom, and I purposely used the word road, was a journey in itself. How is it that a place that charges 55 bucks for a rack of lamb can have such a piece of s@&t bathroom?   And as I sit here on the toilet at 3am all I can tell you is if you think this place is great, then you are from Hoboken NJ because this is a grossly over rated restaurant with horrible food, decor, bathrooms, etc. the owner is laughing to the bank with the fools who go here...AVOID this place.   The restaurant manage reached out to me...good for them...but I'm not interested.  You get ONE chance to make your reputation, and Mr. Celebrity Chef, you lost it here.  AWFUL PLACE!  GROSSLY OVER PRICED!  DON'T WAIST TIME OR MONEY HERE!",

However it is located in the Venetian hotel which has seriously gone downhill from the last time I was there (maybe '05-'06).  Service was great, and friendly too. However the food was ehhh, on the border of \"ok.\" I ordered a filet cooked medium, but I got well (even burnt along edges). My bf ordered the ribeye cooked medium, and he got a True medium - a little pink inside, nicely cooked outside & edges. Our table shared mushrooms (wouldn't recommend, bland), country mashed and au gratin potatoes (both ok), corn (tasty!), and creamed spinach... Only thing was, we never got it. I think we were so busy eating and talking that we didn't realize it till afterwards. I guess it happens.  So all in all, this place is ok. It doesn't rank above the norm, nor would I drag it down... It's a middle of the road type steakhouse. With so many amazing options in Las Vegas, I'd recommend you try another one before here (STK, Chef Ramsey's).",

Most in my crowd thought that the steaks were poorly decorated.  But I was not sure what they expected - steak is steak.  And my filet tasted well enough.  It was cooked well for a medium rare plus, which is hard to do.  So I was impressed enough.  I also shared salmon with someone, but that definitely could have used more salt.  That surprised me considering that this is Emerald's restaurant, where butter and salt is what he *BAM!* loves.  But I had some sides here that I thought were pretty amazing.  The buttered and gratin'd corn here is delicious.  My friends other hand, felt underwhelmed by their mushrooms and asparagus, which I guess I would have to tend to agree.  They did have an excellent wine list, however.  I got some bottles of Shafer Relentless for less than double the retail price, which is a great deal considering that I was at an upper-end steakhouse.  Lastly, what is noteworthy is that this tends to be a pretty good scene.  So not a bad place for a bachelor's party.",

They replaced those amazing Parker House rolls with some nasty Navajo Fry Bread, it's nasty, and greasy, and I don't like it.    Other than the bread f*** up, I like Delmonicos. The chateaubriand for 2 for $100 is a great deal! This is the real reason I come here. It comes with asparagus and garlic smashed potatoes. I add an order of sauteed mushrooms and am in heaven.   The service and atmosphere are also top quality, but because of the rolls being gone, I am giving this place a 3 star rating until they bring them back.",

    "text": "I'll start this review off for you skimmers out there that don't read long reviews. The bone-in rib-eye is the greatest steak experience you will ever have, hands down. Just eat it. Go. Do it.  Now for you that are still with me, here's my full-on, cash money, baller review...for what it's worth:  Delmonico must have a good database manager behind the scenes, because it had been a long time since my last dinner there (prob 5-6 years), yet they immediately greeted me and remembered my patronage (2 visits prior).  What a great feeling (and rather impressive to my gf) that the host and hostess and wait-staff greet you like you're a goddamn king touring the countryside.   This trip to Las Vegas was during a getaway weekend and to see long time friends, but we had a little dinner the night before some festivities for just us. I wanted to visit Delmonico again, because I had remembered such a positive experience with food and service the times before.  So we are greeted by the sommelier and our lead waiter, who throw out a few drinks and possible pairings, review the specials, roll over some changes in the menu (all from memory mind you). We knew we were eating steaks and heartier dishes, so we opted for a bottle of a good Sonoma Cab Sauv we recognized.    The chef paid his compliments with an amuse bouche' of a olive oiled crustini with duck fat and a mushroom.  It was a delicious little oily, fatty, salty bite that told the taste buds \"hey bitches...I'm comin' for you...get ready!\"  We were treated to some hot brioche popovers and full-fat butter, and I had to oblige at least one...cannot say no...(it's completely un-American to pass up on such things).  We decided to start the evening by sharing an heirloom tomato and burrata cheese salad (faux caprese), and a table-side Lobster bisque. The salad was graciously split onto two plates for us, and was perfectly portioned with greens, veg, cheese, and a light dressing (that was not overpowering). The bisque was poured at our table with huge chunks of lobster, and a smooth velvet-like texture. Flavors were perfect and the temp was outstanding. I had mine and finished my gf's (she always worries about getting to full before the main meal comes).  I had ordered the bone-in rib-eye au poivre and my lady chose the Filet Medallions. I must impress upon you again that the Bone-in Rib-eye IS the way to go. It is perfectly broiled at high temp, with amazing peppercorn seasoning and having it with the mushrooms sauce and onions is the bomb-sauce. There is nothing like it. It is a HUGE cut of meat, with great crusting outside, perfect marbling, and the bone-in flavor. The hot-reddish/pink medium to medium-rare center makes for a tender, juicy, and magnificent steak.  I honestly didn't even partake of her medallions much, because I didn't need to, and wouldn't cheat on my rib-eye.  I let the lady try some of mine and she immediately agreed its the best steak, anywhere, ever. We had a side of asparagus as well, which I felt very bad for because I gave it very little love. I hate leaving soldiers on the battlefield but I wanted to win the war with that steak and had a long night ahead of me of shows and clubs and didn't want terrible meat sweats...so I had to be courteous of tummy room.  Now that we've effectively covered food, let me give a swag at the service. Top notch. All the way around. Polite, informed, friendly, attentive enough without being intrusive. Well-trained veteran folks throughout...no schmucks looking to hump tables as a side gig, these are True to form, real career servers who take pride in their appearance, their posture, plating, timing, knowledge, and truly love their career...these folks work years before graduating to a place like Delmonico or Craftsteak, etc. These guys get huge tips and get to work with fine chefs in multi-million dollar restaurants...they're the cream of the wait staff crop.  Total wine, apps, dinner (no dessert, saved room for later on) was what I expected at ~$300. Well worth it to treat ourselves and enjoy a top-notch meal.    Look folks, even if you're not an Emeril fan (yes he owns the Delmonico name), you can still love this place. A) he's no longer the executive chef of either location, B) the experience is always good here and the place stands alone on its merits, and C) that damned rib-eye is scheduled for my last meal on planet Earth (someday).   Trust me folks...when in Vegas...eat like a damned king. Treat yourself to amazing service, amazing food, and good times...ENJOY!!",

From the BBQ shrimp, or the deviled eggs to the amazing cuts of steak.  It was all so delicious.  But, you have to save room for the famous Banana cream pie!!  What an ending. We will be back!!!",

    "text": "First off, to make the most of your experience, you should know what to expect from Delmonico service by doing your Yelp homework. This place doesn't get a full 5 stars because of the service.   It's been a while since I've felt so insulted by a server. I don't even know his name since he didn't introduce himself, so I know him as the big guy with a beard. He was unfriendly and wrote us off immediately when the table next to us wanted to share half of their seafood tower with us (it's massive and delicious by the way... thank you amazing strangers from New Mexico!).  We were celebrating an anniversary and greeted warmly by the host stand, but while other Yelpers say that their servers brought them a scoop of sorbet to celebrate, we got nothing. So hold your server accountable to giving you the experience you deserve for the price tag you pay. He would have gotten 30% if he wasn't such a douche.  ONTO THE FOOD! - Bone-in ribeye: Duh, do as all 1100 Yelp reviews say and get this! Fantastic marbling with an amazing crust. And yes... share a steak and order some other stuff!   - Fingerling potatoes- a light hint of rosemary and more potatoes than a patch on a farm. Really tasty and beautiful. Sides all seem easily shareable for four people.  - Creamed spinach- Not too heavy on seasoning, but perfectly delicious and enjoyable. Perfect with the ribeye.  - Lobster bisque- if you get this, I would highly recommend sharing. It's too rich and heavy to eat a whole bowl.  - Penis-shaped pop-overs (as another Yelp reviewer notes)- Try a bite, but save room for appetizers!  At the end of the day, I would certainly come back for the food. You will end up ordering too much because everything sounds delicious; next time we'll be trying BBQ shrimp and truffled potato chips too!",

Great upscale yet modern American steak house serving Prime American beef along with Piedmontese and Wagyu steaks, Kurobuta pork, lobster and seafood tower, and Foie Gras. Great environment, amazing food, superb service and to go with excellent collection of wine. My wife and I are regular here and we always invite our friends and business contacts to dinner we never had a bad meal or service. Just try to make a reservation because they get fully booked.",

    "text": "So this review is going to be two sided since we had mixed experiences. Let me start out by saying this is my 3rd Emeril's restaurant in Vegas. The other two places Fish House and Table 10 are always on the half priced ticket booth so a discount is always possible but given this is a steakhouse in The Venetian no discount. We came here on Dec 30th before our Marroon 5 concert. Securing a reservation over the phone a few days ahead of time was easy. We had wine, appetizers,2 main entrees,2 side dishes and a dessert.  The service and customer service here is exceptional.   We tried the lobster bisque, pasta special appetizer, BBQ shrimp, Cajun Ribeye, Filet Mignon, Gratin potatoes, Mushrooms and the Choc cake.  Most of the food was delicious but a few fell short like the Ribeye and choc cake. the ribeye was overcooked, not that tender and lacking seasoning. The choc cake was dry and previously frozen. The special pasta appetizer was good but not excellent or anything I would mention ordering again.  The filet was delicious and the demi glaze sauce was the highlight. The BBQ shimp were delicious along with the little biscuit that comes with it. The lobster bisque was creamy and seasoned well. My server let me try a sample before deciding on a main appetizer.   When asked about our dining experience- we were completely honest with the manager and our server. The main issue was how long we waited for our meal and the $55 ribeye didn't live up to his name. They also forgot to put in one of our appetizers. However, this place gets a four instead of a three because of the amazing customer service we received as a guest. They expedited our food and when we received the bill the ribeye, 2 appetizers, and the cake was taken off our entire bill which to me speaks volumes about how great their customer relations and service is. They have a name to live up to . We had a mixed dining experience but I would probably come back and give this place another chance due to the outstanding customer service. Keep up the good work.",

You have to try your steak with their red wine reduction! The wife wanted salmon with lobster sauce which they don't offer. Did they say sorry we don't have lobster sauce? NO! They said we will be happy to make you a creamy lobster sauce and she said it was the best she had ever eaten. Now coming from my wife, that's saying something! She is the pickiest eater in the world! And salmon is a tricky fish to grill because it dries out fast and it was juicy and moist as hell! (I had to try a bite) and they used huge chunks of main lobster in the sauce! AT NO EXTRA CHARGE!!!!!!  The garlic mash (or as they call it, smashed) potato was good and the BBQ shrimp app was really good also. Bottom line, you would be a fool not to try this place out. It was well worth the $145 we spent there!!!!!",

    "text": "I don't get all the great reviews.  Listen - I'm a big Emerill fan, but this place is 10 years past a remodel - and in massive need of a menu overhaul.  I mean - many of these dishes were things he used to cook on his tv show 25 years ago.  I took hubby here to kick off our Vegas birthday celebration weekend and we were both really disappointed.  Atmosphere is stark and old.  Service is attentive but clumsy.  I mean how many people can ask me if my glass of wine is ok - while serving us terrible food.  We started with an a Crispy Octopus app which was good.  Hubby had the 30.00 Foie Gras app which he says was terrible - tasted like overcooked canned cat food.  Terrible.  Our entrees were th BBQ Salmon and the Fried Chicken.  The Salmon was really just so so - kind of outdated and way too much bbq sauce.  Hubby said the Fried Chicken and waffles were just bland and dry.  When Fried Chicken is 36.00 is had better at least be moist.  (he was just about choking on it.)  Finally - they brought him a baby scoop of Mango Sorbet with a candle for his bday.  Sadly, they actually brought it while I was in the bathroom.  When I got back to the table, they re-lit the candle again.  Awkward.    Final bill for two apps, Salmon, Fried Chicken, and two glasses of wine - $250.00  So - definitely will not be returning anytime soon.  The place was mostly empty on a Thursday night - now we know why.  Sorry Emerill - but bad bad bad.  (*two stars instead of one because the fresh popover bread was good.)",

It was a really delicious piece of meat. It was cooked medium rare perfectly. As if the steak wasn't rich enough for us... we decided to add on the seared foie gras. Very good piece of fat! For the sides, we ordered the corn, cream of spinach, broccoli and buttered asparagus. Much needed to counter the meat.   Service was excellent as you expect it to be. I really enjoyed this place and it is great for a fancy dinner one of your nights in Las Vegas. Note that you probably don't want to do anything after. Food coma to the maxxxxxxxxxxxxx!",

The staff is on-point, with notes made as to our personal preferences as to table location, etc. The waitstaff is friendly, knowledgeable, efficient and reliable. The food is superb. Quality ingredients prepared in quality ways. I definitely recommend the steak tartare as an appetizer. The only \"heads-up\" I'd give new patrons is that the sides are rather large. Ordering three or four sides with dinner is contra-indicated unless you are with a large group or dining with teenagers.  Excellent bar and bartenders as well. Ask for the whisky menu and just revel in the selection.",

    "text": "As Vegas steakhouses go, Delmonico is a fine choice. I've been there twice and both times I've had very good meals. With that said, meeting expectations at this high price point is challenging, and particularly on my most recent visit I'm afraid Delmonico should have been even better. This year we had a large company dinner at Delmonico, so I was able to try lots of dishes.   We started with the BBQ shrimp and the butternut squash ravioli. The shrimp was good but a little overcooked. The squash was on the rich side but really tasty - you couldn't have but so many so it is good that they list it as an appetizer rather than as a pasta main. I loved one or two but a plateful would've been too much.  I also tried the truffle potato chips, which were wonderful but extremely truffley.   The lobster bisque was textbook, exactly what lobster bisque is supposed to be - rich and creamy with chunks of tender lobster meat. Still I might have preferred my neighbor's heirloom tomato salad, which I tried and thought was one of the highlights of the meal.  I didn't try it but the duck from the smoked duck salad was not well received by another of my colleagues.   For my entree I had the Delmonico signature steak - a bone-in ribeye. This is where the meal fell down ever so slightly. The steak was fine but for the premium price it should have been exceptional and it definitely wasn't. My order of medium rare was barely pink at all and was probably served on the dark side of medium, and I thought the meat was surprisingly devoid of flavor. Don't get me wrong - it was a fine steak, but it was average among the steaks I've had in Las Vegas, at all price points. One of my close work friends who has frequented Delmonico for years ordered the same cut at the dinner and he agreed that for his steak too it was an off-night. Of the sides I loved the creamed corn. Next time I'd do the mashed potatoes over the scalloped potatoes, which I found undercooked and under seasoned. The asparagus was also fine but unspectacular.   The bread pudding was great and the key lime pie (or was it cheesecake?) was nice too, but I'll reserve my sweetest accolades for the banana cream pie. Best bite of the night. One of the best I've had. Wonderful.",

Last time we went I had the sea bass, which was quite tasty.  As always, try to leave room for the banana cream pie!  The other places have a certain vibe to it that feels like it would be an Emeril Lagasse restaurant, for some reason this one doesn't.

Entrees - my wife had the filet medallions and they were basically disgusting. They were terrible cuts of meat and she was only able to eat about half of it. I had the bone in ribeye which was fine but nothing spectacular. Sides - we had the creamed corn which I thought was terrific, my wife not so much. The potatoes gratin were good but you better like parmesan if you order them.  Dessert - the greatest piece of banana creme pie I've ever had, and it's monsterous!!  Drinks - They didn't have the bacon and bourbon manhattan but the bartender said we weren't missing anything....so why keep it on the menu? Anyway, to finish off the night I had a Dusk in the Burroughs which is just about the perfect after dinner drink. That and the banana creme pie were easily the best things we had the entire evening.   The service was top notch and they took the medallions off the bill and also comped the pie, all without my wife saying anything more than she wasn't impressed with the steak.  In the end the start was good and finish was fantastic, but with the steaks being so bad it really took away from the whole experience. At roughly $50 a steak we just expect way way better, and with so many fine dining options in Vegas it's tough to see us going back anytime soon. Maybe eventually, but it'll be a while if we do.",

    "text": "probably the best steak ive had in my life yet.  first and foremost it is a steakhouse.  so you can go ahead and eat whatever else is on the menu, but if you come to this spot without ever trying their steak youre a foolio. ive been here several times now and each time my experience is stellar on the social and epicurious level.  good service, fantastic food, youre in vegas, what else do you want? (i guess winning jackpot at the casino would round it off nicely, but thats a whole 'nother story :)  anyway, so in my opinion, dont even bother with the filet mignon, that cut is way over rated, which fancy pants rich people have turned into this \"exclusive\" non weight bearing tender cut of bovine that the social elite should be eating.  while, all of the tenderness story is True, the flavor is all in the bone in ribeye.  this place uses usda prime aged cut, which is the best you can get.  and get it bone in, the bones give off more flavor in the cooking process.  another sign of a good steak house is if its served with butter, which not every place does, but i personally think makes the meat taste 10x better.  one other thing i did like about this place is their dinner rolls served to everyone at the beginning of your dinner.  ya ya, dinner rolls, so what.  well, it was actually fresh here.  freshly made, warm, with a little bit of salt on it.  its like being at an awesome steakhouse that has a pan del sal bakery in it!  all in all, it's great food, great service, good location, being in between the palazzo and venetian, thats all you need.  just make sure you bring money, cause this place is on the pricey side, but have no fear, you will get your money's worth!",

    "text": "Let me start off by saying this is my favorite steakhouse anywhere. Anytime I'm in Vegas, I have to come here.  Emerils BBQ strip are amazing, as is the table side Cesar salad. These are a great way to start your meal.   For entrees, I have had the rack of lamb, fish specials, etc. All are very good. What keeps me coming back is the bone in rib steak, which is the house specialty. All the beef here is wet and dry aged and amazing. The bone in rib is huge, but you will want to eat every bite and gnaw on the one, although not entirely appropriate at a restaurant of this caliber. Be forewarned that if you order a steak, you get a steak, nothing else. All sides are ala carte and family style. I personally choose to avoid the sides and save the room for the amazing beef.   The wine selection here is superb. Whether you are looking for a bottle of the finest bordeaux or simply a great by the glass selection, they have it.  For desserts, you can't go wrong with chef emeril. Pecan pie, peanut butter pie, creme brulee, and banana creme pie, all amazing. Go for the peanut butter pie, or the banana creme, if they are featured that day.  The service here is second to none. The staff is friendly and knowledgable, without being stuffy.  When in Vegas, check out delmonico steakhouse, I know you'll keep coming back like I do.",

    "text": "HORRIBLE.  absolutely horrible.  i've had dental surgeries that were more enjoyable than this evening and paying the bill was like paying taxes.  i know a lot of yelpers have had good experiences and i apologize if i'm bringing those down.  but for us, we called months in advance to make reservations.  because of a show we were to attend we had to have dinner late that evening.  so in making the reservations we asked the person if that would be a problem.  we had no desire to be rushed through dinner and out of the restaurant, so we would have changed our plans if it would have been an issue.  she told us, \"oh no problem, absolutely no problem.\".  we even told her what our worries about a late reservation were and again she assured us, \"no problem\".  so when we got there we ordered salads and wine.  i noticed the waiter kept pushing us to order so i told him \"we'd like to finish our salads before we order\".  sure enough.....\"well our kitchen is going to close in 15-minutes so you have to place your order now\".  what do you do?  i'd already ordered a $200.00 bottle of wine.  so we ordered our meal.  although the steak was good the vegetables looked like they had sat on the stove most of the evening.  the potato was so cold it wouldn't even melt the butter they shoved in it.  i couldn't believe it.  i managed to get through most of the steak, giving up when all around me the wait staff started setting up tables for the next day.  you would think at a minimum they would have left the lights turned down low so we could have enjoyed our meal with some sense of ambience.  but i guess the wait staff wouldn't have been able to see the glasses they were polishing at every table around us.  literally every table around us.  of course the music was turned off once the lights came up so we got to listen to all their conversations for entertainment.  our waiter was arrogant border-lining on rude.  this one is funny, get this....when i asked for a wine recommendation he actually looked at me and said, \"how much would you like to spend.  $50.00?\".  residing in hawaii we were in dress aloha wear but i assure you we didn't look like we were going to try to pay with food stamps.  when we were seated he was so kind and cordial to the table of young ladies next to us i was surpised at what we got out of him.  i guess i should have strapped on some boobs to increase our chances of decent respectable service.       i think the worse fallout from this experience for me is now i don't want to waste time or energy going to one of the major chef's restaurants.  i mean this was emeril's place for god sakes.  i'm originally from the south and understand southern hospitality, which i thought emeril attempts too express in everything he does.  i assure you it doesn't exist in this place.  this restaurant has literally turned me against \"fine dining\".  i should have went to the hard rock and saved $350.00.    anyone know where i can buy strap-on boobs?  i might want to try fine dining again sometime.",

    "text": "This was my first trip to Vegas...ever.  I know, how can that be after 31 years of age and my love for everything naughty?  Nevertheless, I wanted to have one memorable, fantastic dinner while there.  After consulting with a few friends and reading fellow yelpers reviews we decided on Delmonico Steakhouse at the Venetian.  First, I was able to make our reservation online about two months in advance (same time I booked the trip).  It was so easy I would definitely recommend it to ensure you will have a table ready and waiting for you.  Second, because Mr. Vivi and I were killing it at the Blackjack table at the Mandalay...we were about 15 minutes late for our reservation.  I apologized numerous times when we arrived, and to my relief our table was still ours and the host was super friendly and understanding.  Note:  I don't know if this would fly on a busy Fri or Sat night.  To say the service was excellent could be an understatement.  We had our main server, I think his name was Eric (insert free drinks at the aforementioned Blackjack table so his name could have been Bob) and he couldn't be more helpful, polite and efficient.  We also had two other people who were assisting Eric with the service who were great as well.  Eric helped me pick out a glass of red wine that was delicious and didn't make me feel bad for not being the wine connoisseur everyone and their mom thinks they are.  Our drinks were brought to us very quickly and we were off to the food.    I had been perusing the menu for awhile and thought we would go with a full four course meal however, I had no idea how fun the tables would be and didn't want too much food to deter my winnings after dinner.  We opted to skip the appetizer (would have loved to have try the crab cakes or at least the Parmesan potato chips) and went straight to the Cesar salad served table side for two.  If you love Cesar salad please do me a favor and run to this place.  They freaking make the entire thing in front of you, dressing included.  When Eric was finished with my plate I could have clapped I was so happy...in fact I think I did.   Next, we went for the petite medallions with a side of asparagus and a twice baked potato.  Can I say I am in heaven??  This is why I could never be a vegetarian.  The meat was cooked to absolute perfection.  So tender it felt like butter in my mouth.  The asparagus and twice baked potato were both good, but I would definitely try something different next time...there is just too much to chose from.    I knew in advance the bill was going to be somewhat expensive but seriously, it was worth every single penny.  From start to finish the entire experience made me forget I left a table we were up 500 dollars.  \"Ah yeah babe,\" this place is that good and I will be back the next time I visit.",

    "text": "LOVE me some Delmonico!  As a big fan of Emeril Lagasse, I had to stop in to one of his restaurants in Vegas, and figured I would have to eat here for my birthday dinner. Definitely, definitely worth it. First off, if you're stopping in, I would recommend making reservations beforehand, as it can get quite busy, especially Friday and Saturday nights. Love the fact that it's in the Venetian, as that's usually my go to hotel in Vegas, and very easy to get to from the Casino floor. Very casual atmosphere, but very upscale service. Our server was fantastic, and we were well taken care of from the moment we stepped in. First class all the way. The food was everything I was hoping for and more. Had calimari for an appetizer- delicious. The bread that came with the meals- delicious. Decided on the filet mignon for main course, with sides of creamed corn and cheese grits. Spectacular. The filet mignon was the best steak I've ever had, bar none. Cooked PERFECTLY, it just melted in my mouth, and you couple that with the creamed corn, which seriously could be the best vegetable I've ever eaten, and holy smokes, you've got yourself a classic meal.  Since it was my birthday, I decided on the root beer float for desert. Awesome. It was a New Orleans root beer served with homemade vanilla ice cream, and it was awesome. Just awesome. Plus side- the servers hooked me up with a free chocolate cake type desert because it was my special day! I felt so loved! Overall, I LOVE Delmonico. The prices are a lot more than you'd pay for an outback or longhorn, but that should be a given. The service was spectacular, the atmosphere fantastic, and the food out of this world. If you're looking for a delicious steak dinner on the strip, it doesn't get any better than Emeril's Delmonico. Oh yeah, babe.",

    "text": "Delmonico's is a great place to dine while staying in Vegas (especially if you are staying at the Venetian).    Service: The distinguishing characteristic here is the service.  We had 10:00pm reservation on Valentine's day and were flying in to Vegas to meet friends for a weekend getaway (got that? good).  Our flight out of SFO was delayed and we ended up arriving at the restaraunt at 10:48, long after we should have been seated etc.  Our waitress was the essence of efficiency; without missing a beat she let us know that last orders were due at 11:00.  They key here was she always made us feel like she was on \"our team\" rather than making us feel as if our lateness at created an inconvienience for her.  She helped all six of us get seated and get our orders in \"before the bell\" (as it were).  She got a $100+ tip for being a pro.  Food: This is a steakhouse, order a steak.  Mine was flavorful without being fatty or gristly, pink without being bloody and just the right amount charred on the outside.  This was the ribeye steak, but the bone-in ribeye ordered by one of my partners in crime was equally well-prepared and duly appreciated.  My wife thought her crab-stuffed halibut (wrapped in a potato skin) was good (but not great?).    Cost: You won't find an entree for under $50 and the sides are extra (we had a group of 6 so that actually worked out wonderfully and we ended up dining quasi-family-style).  The asparagus and mushrooms were hits!  With tip (21%), the bill came to exactly $100/person.  I think we all had at least one drink and the girls split a bottle of wine, one desert and a few coffees were ordered.  Bottom Line: The service here was friendly and professional.  The staff make you feel welcome and are eager to please.  The food is extremely good and a decent value (it is Vegas after all).  Go here if you like steak and are willing to pay a little extra.",

A really beautiful steak dinner and they did an excellent job of making our special occasion extra special. SO GOOD!!! Steak was cooked to perfection and the cajun rub that they put on it was really a nice touch. Can't hate anything with a large pat of butter on top either- of course it was everything I had hoped this filet would be and more. The crispy outside of the cajun spices was really a nice addition of course an emril style thing you'd hope for. YUM!",

    "text": "Delmonico Steakhouse is at the Venetian.  After the Venetian lost my luggage last summer (see my Venetian reviews for the entire story) I swore I wouldn't step foot in the Venetian. It pains me to admit this, but I stepped foot in the Venetian during my most recent Vegas trip :(  Just to clarify, this was NOT by choice, but by circumstance. Me, my boyfriend, and 2 other couples wanted to do a nice dinner. Long story short, one of the other couples raved about this restaurant and made dinner reservations for all of us.   With that being said, this steakhouse blew me away. It was surprisingly really good.    **APPETIZERS: I had the French Onion Soup and my boyfriend had a salad. The appetizers were so-so. We definitely could've have done without ordering them since our entrees and sides were filling.  **ENTREES: My boyfriend and I each ordered the Bone in Ribeye. Had we known how HUGE they were, we would've just ordered one and shared. I was surprised at how good my steak was. I wanted to pull a \"Fred Flinstone\" and pick up the steak with my hands and gnaw on the entire thing.  My steak was prepared well, seasoned well, and tasted delicious. Even with all that deliciousness there was just so much meat that neither of us finished our steaks.   **SIDES: We had the Creamed Corn Gratin & Potato Gratin. Both of which were creamy and delicious.    The service was fine, the ambiance was nice, the steak and sides were fantastic. I'm just annoyed that this restaurant is located in the Venetian -_-",

I personally feel steak sauces take away from the authenticity of the taste and the quality of the meat. My boyfriend had a crab salad and the doublecut kurobuta pork chop. I'm not a big fan of pork in general but this was a super delicious dish.   Unfortunately, we did not have any appetizers or dessert because we were still full from the buffet we had for lunch.

Located next to the Blue Man group theatre at the Venetian, this place was packed on a Saturday night and for good reason.   From reading all the other reviews, there really wasn't any other choice to be made than to order the bone-in ribeye. We both ordered that except I got mines with foie gras since I miss it sooo much (california ban no bueno). I understand how fattening it is, especially with a steak, but its Vegas and she looked so effing hot and I told myself, NIKE! (just do it!) I got mines medium rare like the pros and it came out just as I had hoped - not overcooked, although there were small parts where I questioned if it was too rare for me! I mean my whole mentality that night before we met up with my friends at Hakkasan ft. Calvin Harris was #yolo! so I figured it WHY NOT? To my very surprise, I managed to finish ~85% of the huge piece of steak, which was quite an accomplishment for myself. The meal itself was exquisite, with service being impeccable, and a prefix to one amazing night.",

Not worth ordering again in the future. I had to of course order the bone-in ribeye for my entree. It's disappointing to me when a steakhouse doesn't cook a steak the way you had requested... especially a high end one such as this. I ordered medium-rare. It was definitely cooked medium. I don't usually send food back because other people are with me and I'd have to make them wait. I can still enjoy my food if it's not perfect. However, I do make a note of it on my reviews so that the chefs and future customers know. I'm sure this isn't a mistake that they make regularly (At least I hope not!). I also prefer a saltier steak. It could have used more fat too. I like my hypertension and cholesterol... The sides we ordered for the table were all delicious. Mushrooms & creamed corn were probably the best. Creamed spinach and gratin were just okay. I tried some of my friend's chicken. It was pretty good, but the sides it came with were the most impressive.   As expected from a nice steakhouse such as this, the service was excellent.",

We walked in and were warmly greeted by the hostesses and seated quickly in the beautiful dining room of classic romantic design. Our table was impeccably set with china banded in red, trimmed in gold, similar to that of the GW Bush era at the White House. We had a friendly, attentive staff of four serving us our Chateaubriand, sauteed tableside, that was so tender and done to perfection the knives we were given surely were for decoration - we did not need to use them. I highly recommend this dining experience if you are interested in a romantic, classic setting with a menu and wine list fit for the king and queen that you are :) Do give the Duck Egg Creme Brulee' a try - it was marvelous!",

I have been going to Delmonico since about four year ago and I have never been disappointed once.  One of my favorite things about this place is every time I have made a reservation I have always got seated almost exactly on time.  This place is not cheap nor is it too overpriced compared to other steakhouses in Las Vegas that don't even come close to this one.  One of my favorite things is they have an great selection of scotches and bourbon, the have a separate menu for it and if you like either please make sure and check it out.  Give this place a try and know that I recommend it to everyone.",

It honestly is the best way for a single diner or even two people to enjoy a nice evening without the pretense of an uppity experience.  My friend and I came to Delmonico, dressed in tank tops and jeans, so we found an open spot up front. The bartenders are friendly and just as polished as any server. The recommendations for red pairing with our bone in ribeye to the port at the end was perfection. We started our meal off with the steak tartare. It has to be the second best in the city. I wished they would use a quail egg to dress it instead of a chicken's. Moving on to our entree, we split the ribeye and it was more than enough for the both of us. Add a side of the haricot vert with sauteed shallots and it is the perfect meal. Being in an Emeril restaurant we we had to finish with one of his specialty desserts. I tend to not be a big pie fan, so we went with the bread pudding. It is decadent and comes in a generous portion. No one person should be able to polish one off on their own.   This is one of those restaurants were I would not even bother with getting a table and would prefer to eat out at the bar.",

    "text": "My husband and I went there for lunch on a Saturday. We had a physically exhausting week so we decided to treat ourselves. But it hasn't always been easy for our allergy whenever we ate out. So we called Delmonico ahead to see if they can accommodate our special needs. The lady who answered our call was very courteous and we felt comfortable to try after having some answers from her. As we arrived, the restaurant has a comfortable ambience. I wouldn't say it is grand or special but just comfortable. When it was time to order, the server was courteous regarding our allergy too and I believe the one who took care of us was a manager. He even checked with the chef to make sure the complimentary popover was okay for us to consume. We told them we are allergic to soy, corn, peanut, tomato and pork products, and some other stuff, and he had been very mindful and advised accordingly as we ordered, he did it so graciously that we didn't feel being put in a spot. Some other semi high end restaurants had given us a startled face or even an uncomfortable face when we mentioned our allergy, but this manager was super professional that he didn't make us feel crappy about our differences from others. So he made a potential stressful situation easy for us, very impressive. Their steak was aged in house by the restaurant and we think their aging was done fabulously as there was no rotten smell or taste in it. The manager even double checked with us and informed us that the beef was sourced from corn fed cows and asked if we would be able to tolerate that. And we made our decision to say yes and went ahead with the steak. Their steaks were very delicious. We actually asked for medium well with no seasoning and the steak still came out super delicious and juicy. So the good quality is in the steak itself and didn't need to depend on seasoning or being served bloodily. Again, very impressive. Anyway, it was a delicious meal and we were well taken care of so we didn't get sick from any event of undisclosed allergens. We are very happy with this meal. We would go back when we have another time wanting to treat ourselves again. Hopefully the manager will be there again the next time we visit.",

What a great choice. We had the fries oysters and I could've had three orders. They were perfectly prepared and so savory! We were served several piping hot pop over rolls with rosemary baked into them. They literally melt in your mouth. It was late and we weren't super hungry so we decided to try several small plates.  We split the salmon. The salmon was perfect. A bit spicy, a bit sweet with potato hash and andoulle sausage. We also had the creamed spinach, BBQ shrimp and the grits. I didn't love the grits but everything else was awesome. They have a full selection of bourbons (an entire book) which made my bf very happy. I had a really crisp Rose' .. it was really good. The staff works as a team to make sure no needs go unmet. Nicole was so engaging and accommodating. We will go back next time we are in town.",

    "text": "During a Christmas Holiday trip to Las Vegas with my sister,we were staying at Paris Las Vegas Hotel but dined at several others. Most of these experiences were positive except one. We had attended a show at the Venetian and afterwards wanted to dine someplace we hadn't tried before. My sister had been to a Delmonico's elsewhere so we opted to go to the one close to the Sands Showroom of The Venetian. This was probably about 9:30-10:00pm and there were no other people waiting to be seated. When we approached the hostess she asked for my name and then replied \"something\" so quickly I didn't understand what she had said. My sister told me the hostess had said to have a seat in the bar until we were called. We did and were approached by one of the cocktail waitresses but we explained we were just waiting to dine and didn't want any drinks. When we were finally shown to a table in essentially a very empty dining room with MANY empty tables,we were shown to a VERY small table for two up against a wall. Before even being seated I said I'd prefer to sit elsewhere. Rather than accommodate us or explain why we couldn't have one of the other tables nearby we were told to go back to the bar to wait while they\"checked\"(?). At this point I decided we had enough but still said politely \"no thanks,we'll just go elsewhere\" and the hostess rather sarcastically replied \"well, have a good evening\" as we walked out. Her \"attitude\" was totally inappropriate and not only would I never go there again,but I would steer others away as well. There are plenty of other excellent restaurants in the many hotels in Las Vegas and many with a staff that provide excellent service. Delmonico's is NOT one of those.",

My husband ordered a $50 steak that was fatty and gristley.  I could tell he was bummed when he poked around at his steak with furrowed eyebrows, cutting off piece after piece of inedible meat.    I was really hoping to please him since it was his birthday.  I let them know when I made the reservations well in advance that it was his birthday and we didn't get a birthday dessert or anything free like you do at most other restaurants.  They remembered it was his birthday, the hostess (who was pleasant and very friendly) gave him a cheery happy birthday as we were going to be seated.  I really expect a little something special if we are spending our special day at their establishment.    The waitstaff was prompt and friendly.  They seemed to linger around and dive right in when you need a refill on your drink, or in my case another great martini.  I almost forgot to mention that I loved their martinis.    Will we return?  Definitely no.  There are way more better restaurants in Vegas.  The atmosphere is a big blah (with the exception of the impressive suits that the friendly waitors wear), the food was just okay/slightly better than average, and the prices higher than they should be for the quality.",

We arrived earlier than our reservation, so while we were waiting we were looking at the menu outside to see what we would have.    I thought I had made my decision, but once inside we found out that the chef makes something special each day.  So of course this is what I decided on ordering, and so did he.  Which I was a little bummed because I was hoping he would order something different so we can share.  Our dish was served in a large bowl, and it was a sampling of pork, beef and chicken that was served over garlic mash potatoes.   We also ordered the caesar salad prepared table side.  This was very impressive and of course delicious.  For desert I chose the banana cream pie and he chose the double chocolate fudge cake.  They were both superb, which I wasn't expecting any less.  The service is impeccable.  I have never been to a restaurant this nice and I felt like a queen for the time that we were there.  There were just two of us, but be had three servers attending our table.  While we were waiting to be seated we sat in the bar and we were watching a basketball game.

That having been said, it's really hard to go wrong with a steak here! The NY strip is huge, delicious, and, in my experience, cooked to perfection. The sides, while pretty standard fare, are quite good. I find the creamed spinach and mushrooms to be particularly noteworthy, while the asparagus was uninspired. The value is reasonable, in spite of the fairly high price, so no complaints there. With the number of great options in the Venetian/Palazzo, let alone in Las Vegas in its entirety, it can be hard to stand out, but Delmonico Steakhouse manages to do so.",

Service is great.  Food is amazing. Trumpets sounded when I took my first bite into the \"Bone-In Ribeye.\"   I would highly recommend that you discuss with your server the definition of medium rare and medium. I know one time a friend said it was undercooked for medium rare, but honestly it was fine. He had a different definition for medium rare based on past experiences with \"other steakhouses\" (but I am not sure I would refer to them as real steakhouses).",

So instead of Fleming's, Capital Grille, or BOA, the three other places I had thought about to kick off my friend's bachelor party weekend, this is where we end up for dinner on the Friday night.  The four of us arrived about 15 minutes early and were promptly seated, busy but not completely packed.  The service was above average, but not warm, mechanical is the best word to describe. I asked for the three bottles of wine I brought to be decanted, which was no problem at all. No Riedels, but nice enough stemware to pass.  We ordered an antipasto for the table to get started. I had the Classic Steak Tartare as the appetizer and had the dry-aged Bone In Rib Steak as the entree.  The Classic Steak Tartare is the best presentation of such I've seen. Tartare in the center with individual garnishes fanned out, completed with baguette toast points. Flavor was good, but missing the bam element I expected.  The Rib Steak I ordered was suppose to be medium-rare, but was closer to a medium, which was fine by me, as I tend to like it somewhere in between the two. Word of caution here, all four steaks we had at our table, the temperature were missed by close to one notch, rare = medium rare, medium-rare = medium...etc. Good piece of raw material, but the kitchen failed to make it stand-out. Again, seasoning was lacking, salt and pepper can definitely be used more liberally.  Ordered three desserts to pass around the table to finish the dinner, nothing interesting here to write home about.  The total including tax, tip and corkage came out to be $450 for the four of us, not a bad price tag especially considering we are in Vegas.  With this outing, I think I am completely done with top name destination Vegas restaurants. Aureole, Bradley Ogden,  Picasso and now this, none has given me a desire to visit for a second time.",

Word is he signed a contract with MGM properties so no other place on the strip can use his name outside of the MGM properties. The only mention you will see is his first name mentioned in the dessert selection, other than that nothing.  The atmosphere is nice and the waiter service is killer. However the food was lacking, the steak although cooked to perfection lacked some flavor and they do not mention how large the steaks are. Thepetit filet mignon was tiny, six ounces for sixty dollars which included three overcooked shrimp lobster topped.   The frog legs were good, a different for once and their selection of fine drinks is a good selection.",

    "text": "I'll start by saying that the ribeye steak I had at Delmonico's was the best that I've ever had, hands down. Even the sides that my fiance and I split: smashed potatos, and asparagus-- were top notch. It's too bad that such an awesome culinary experience had to be ruined by everything else.  First off: the decor. VERY spare, with high ceilings. Kind of felt like I was eating in a fancied up gymnasium. The dining room was dark but the sparse spot lighting was harsh, taking away any sort of mellow ambiance they hoped to achieve.  About 5 minutes after we were seated, a party of 7 very loud middle aged men came into the restaurant and sat at the table next to us. My fiance and I only ordered salad and dinner, and soda to drink since we don't pay for booze in Vegas. ;) This OTHER table was ordering bottles of wine and appetizers out the wazoo, and the waitstaff took the cue to ignore us and focus on the table that certainly ensured a bigger tip.  This was a HUGE turnoff. We are very lowkey customers by nature -- no substitutions, no special requests -- I waited tables during my college years so I know what it's like to be on the other side of things. But to sit there for 10 minutes with empty plates and glasses in front of us while 4 or so staffmembers fell over each other at the adjacent table uncorking bottles, getting out appetizers... it was unacceptable. It made us feel like intruders with our lowly $130 bill.  PLUS, they charged us for soda refills? at $2.00 a pop. If I'm paying $50 for a steak, don't charge me for a stupid refill of Diet Coke.  The meal itself was awesome, but with so many other options in Vegas to choose from, we probably won't be going back. I was happier with the French Toast Slam I had at Denny's earlier in the day: No pretension, my waiter didn't suck, and I didn't get charged for a refill.",

Most people had steak and Delmonico fared extremely well, with one person saying it was one of the two best steakhouses he had ever been to. We enjoyed the appetizers -- Emeril sure knows his barbequed shrimp! Sides were excellent, including asparagus, creamed corn, and au gratin potatoes. I had the salmon, which was extremely flavorful and perfectly prepared (despite being farm raised). The wine list is extensive and impressive, although finding a reasonably priced bottle was a challenge. Service was truly exceptional.  We had appetizers to share for the whole table, top-end entrees, and two desserts.  Also quite a few bottles of wine (albeit on the lower end of the price list) and several after dinner drinks.  With tax and tip the meal was a bit over $150/person.  Clearly not a budget place, but for a top Las Vegas restaurant and for the amount we ordered I thought this very reasonable.  You could easily blow the budget on that wine list though!",

In any case, I was dying to taste ribeye in every restaurant and since this place was highly touted as being one of the best in Vegas, I had to go here.  So surprise, surprise, I ordered the rib-eye.  My wife ordered the filet mignon.  My impression before we received our dishes was that this was an upscale place so we were expecting meats on the level of Ruth's Chris Steakhouse.  I was slightly disappointed in that their rib-eye, although good, I felt was only slightly better than a Black Angus steak.  I've had a much better tasting rib-eye from Smitty's in Pasadena.  The filet was nice and tender so that was the bright spot during our dinner date.  We also ordered a couple of glasses of cab and so it complemented our steaks very well.  The service was, as you would come to expect, excellent.  If it wasn't for the rib-eye, which was lacking some flavor, I would've given it a 5-star rating.",

With the main meal it took a while to get and when we got it, the steak that i had ordered ~medium~ was more like extra rare still kicking, and after taking the first bite out of it, it was already luke warm. After telling the waiter about the steak he took it and brought it back, medium rare, still bloody. I didn't think it was possible to mess up on a steak twice in a row, but oh well. The side dish's were asparagus, garlic mashed potatoes, spinach, and garlic mushroom. Just like the steak it got cold too fast, as well as the side dish's, however the garlic mashed potatoes, and the mushrooms were good while they were warm. The spinach would have tasted better if it had come from a can and the asparagus was nothing special, just expensive asparagus!  Overall: The food needs to be served on hot plates! The service was awesome, and that was probably the best quality of the restaurant.",

    "text": "I have been on the lookout for the perfect filet for some time now.  My search has put this place on the top of my list.  After years of waiting I finally  was able to dine at the famed Delmonico Steakhouse in Vegas.  I was promised by steak loving friends that the filet was so perfect you didn't need a knife to cut it.  My wife and I arrived a bit early so we could check out their bar.  The ambiance while very nice, was not what I had expected.  It was also not very busy which also threw me off a bit.  Anyway, we sat at the bar and I ordered up my usual (Goose martini with 3 blue cheese olives) and my wife ordered a glass of wine.  We chatted up the friendly bar tender, finished our drinks then headed into the main dining area to be seated.  First we were given a ginormous wine list that took us 10 minutes to go through and another 10 minutes to decided what we wanted.  We settled on a very reasonably priced bottle and our waiter was not at all pissed that we didn't drop $100's on a bottle.  First they bring you a small dinner roll/bread thing that was very unremarkable.  I liked it that they brought you a single roll so I couldn't eat 4 of them and ruin my dinner, but it just wasn't that good so I really didn't want more than one.  Probably for the best though.  For an appetizer we shared the gulf shrimp cocktail which was excellent.  The shrimp were boiled in some creole stuff which gave them a very nice flavor.  They give you 4 large shrimp which is perfect for sharing although I could have eaten them all myself.  If you like super hot cocktail sauce then be sure to ask for a side of horseradish to heat it up some more.  Then we had the Caesar  salad which is prepared tableside and is a 2 person portion.  While the salad was pretty good, I wouldn't order it again.  They add some spices to it that I just don't think belong in a salad and gave it an odd flavor.  As per our steakhouse usual, my wife and I split the filet and we both thought it was excellent.  It wasn't perfect, but probably one of the best I have ever had.  It was cooked perfectly, had excellent flavor and the rub they used wasn't too overpowering.  The steak was very tender but not the cut-with-your-fork kind of tender I am looking for.  At 9oz it was a perfect size to split and not feel overly full after our meal.  For sides we ordered the veggie of the day (broccoli) and the fingerling potatoes.  I guess they were pretty good but I should have ordered a few of their less healthy options like creamed spinach or mashed potatoes.  My wife was in charge of the sides this time but next time I'm ordering something good.  My wife and I are both suckers for desserts made in house so we had to try their pecan pie.  It was ok but I would try sometime else next time like the cheese cake.  I wasn't a fan of the crust but I was a fan of the size; it wasn't huge and was perfect for 2 people to share.  After dinner my wife ordered a decaf coffee and for some reason I had absinthe.  The after dinner drink menu caught my eye because it had like 5 different selections of absinthe which is very unique.  I asked if I could do a sampler of them all but they said no.  Instead, I settled on one and it was very good.  I am not a very experienced absinthe drinker so I really couldn't tell you if it was any better than any other one but it was quite good......and strong.  I still have no idea why the heck I ordered it.  My entire Delmonico experience was excellent.  Our entire waitstaff crew (there had to be 4 people waiting on us) were fast, friendly and helpful.  The price for the steak was reasonable and comparable to other steakhouses, but everything else was pretty high.  Anyway, I would definitely dine here again and honestly cannot wait to return.",

My wife and I have dined here twice; the first time because we were staying at the Venetian and the second time we purposely came back to eat here on one of our anniversaries while staying in Vegas.  In short this is a fantastic formal steakhouse experience all around.  What sold us was the Chateaubriand for two. Expertly cooked and finished off by table side with a flame of cognac for that over-the-top Vegas style experience.  Quite possibly one of the most memorable steaks we've had in our life. Tender with an explosion of flavor when you take a bite, mmm.  There are several wonderful side dishes you can choose to complement the meat and so far we haven't been disappointed in any of them whether you go for the vegetable of the day (garlic pan fried green beans the last time were there) or the bacon and cheddar grits, mashed potatoes, or baked potato. Oh and for your prerequisite greenery before the meat course they also do a fantastic Caesar salad prepared at table side for 2 as well.  Desert? Yes please!  You can't go wrong with their caramel cream brulee but everything on their dessert menu looked sweetly decadent.  I don't think I need bother describing the wine or drink menu here other than this is Vegas after all and if you possibly couldn't find what you're after here to complement your meal then I'm sure they could get it for you.",

    "text": "Note to Vegas douchebags (all of you): when you are planning a dinner at a well known restaurant that's oozing stars and dollar signs, Ed Hardy is not considered dressing up. This is my splurge dinner on this vacation. I'm writing this at the table - key tones off of course, keeping it classy. I had a reservation for 9:00, got there 5 minutes early, and waited 25 minutes. Not unheard of, but neither is an apology or a \"thank you for waiting.\" I also felt a little ignored as a single diner not ordering alcohol. My soda glass sat empty for a long time before I was asked if I wanted another. This happened twice, once between appetizer and main course, and once when i had a third of my steak left. No mention of whether I would be charged for refills, but either way that will be factored into the tip.  Either assume that I would like it refilled and don't let it hit the table empty, or show some sort of bottle or other indication that I'll be seeing $4-5 each on the bill. I also didn't appreciate the lonely roll that was deposited on my table. Just because I'm by myself doesn't mean I don't want a little basket of warm rolls to scarf down at my leisure. I was asked if I wanted another after I was done, and I declined. It was also brought out at the end of the appetizer, which indicated to me that it had been initially forgotten.  My appetizer was completely delicious. I am sad to inform you that it was a special and may not be there when you dine. It was lump crab and gnocchi. Pesto, brown butter, lemon. The crab tasted like Dungeness, the best of course. The gnocchi was toasty and so delicate that I could have eaten it with a spoon like ice cream.  Next came the rib eye, medium, and creamed corn gratinee. The corn was good. The topping was crispy. The steak was definitely closer to medium well than medium. I expect a $50 steak to be flavorful and cut like butter. There were bites that I felt I was choking down. I also found it to be underseasoned. When I asked for sauces, I was given three options. Bearnaise, Emeril style A-1, and something muttered of which I only heard worcestershire. I think it might have been just that. I opted for the E-1. It didn't solve the seasoning issue and I found the taste odd.  The verdict is in on the diet coke. It was three dollars and I was not charged for refills. Why keep asking then?  I don't see how that could be considered elevated service. I had a much better meal and experience last year at SW at the Wynn. I will not be back to Delmonico.",

    "text": "Third visit here -- once alone, once with daughter, now with wife and daughter.  Had always enjoyed it...until this time.       Service has always been primo.     On my first visit, the main course -- bone-in rib steak -- was fantastic.  Side dishes had minor flaws (soup and salad both too delicately flavored, roll a little stale and not warm).  Wines by the glass were excellent.     On 2nd visit, the food and service were again excellent.     This time would have been the same -- wife and daughter enjoyed their food -- but for one thing.   How does a high end steakhouse screw up their \"signature\" dish?       I again ordered the bone-in rib steak (the most expensive dish at $52).  I ordered it medium rare.  When it came it was well seared (almost blackened) on the outside -- which is fine, it's supposed to be that way.  It is an extremely thick cut -- a good 2\".  I cut into the center to have a look...it was bleeding purple.  The bread girl happened by and saw it:  \"would you like to speak to the waitress?\"  The waitress came, took one look, and said, \"oh my god; you ordered medium rare, right?\"  \"Uh, yeah.\"  She took it away.       After a long while, it came back.  Not a new steak, but the same one, now cooked medium well.  At least it was cooked, and it tasted good, but the whole experience was ruined.  Compensation?  Zip.  \"Sorry about that.\"  \"Sorry for the wait.\"  A guy came by who may have been the cook to ask if it was okay now; seemed offended that I sent it back in the first place.     I guess that can happen anywhere.  Not sure I'll come back, as there are so many places in Vegas to choose from.",

I'm writing this review half a year after eating here so I don't remember specifics, but I do remember my scallops were very salty (but tender, and huge). What wasn't huge were certain cuts of steak, which basically came in a little cube. Service was amazing though, and the decor in clean, white, and perfect lighting. The inner dining area was better looking but empty at the time, I think they were trying to seat everyone to the outer sides of the restaurants first. Overall, I had a pleasant time but wasn't wow'ed by the flavors or bill. I'll still give Delmonico here in NYC a try though.",

Two servers wait on you and actually share the foodie secrets you want to know.  Allergic to seafood and think steak is a food group for a husband or a meat lover, no problem, let the chefs here make you a special dish or sauce not on the menu that you will never forget.  The sturgeon was a designer version of catfish, and was very impressive.  By end of the 4th course, with a bonus freebie in the middle compliments of the chef, you have the Olympic urge to go for dessert.  Go for the gold.  Not to sweet, not too rich, just amazing - like everything in New Orleans, just like Emeril.   Chocolate treats here won't disappoint.  By 8pm, the place is packed, and the magic is nearly gone, so come early, esp. with a date, you won't be disappointed.",

Went to a show before so I dropped a wonderful bottle of wine before and felt insulted when the man at the front desk said \"you know there is a $25 fee for corkage\". If he would have bothered to look at the bottle he would have noticed that it was a very high end bottle of Napa Cab. Anyhow, we were seated and our waiter was trying to tell us how smart and connected he was with all the wineries and  then mispronounced the name of our wine. He never offered to decant it, that was unacceptable. So I ordered the Bone in Rib Eye and it was the toughest piece of steak I have had in a long time. My wife had he filet and loved it. We had creamed spinach and sauteed mushrooms for our side, They were average at best. After mentioning the steak issue the waiter said he would \"let somebody know\". He never came back during service so I never had the chance to send it back. The waiter came back and said that corkage was $ 30 and he got someone to waive it. Funnt the guy up front said it was $ 25. Bottom line was Delmonico did not produce 5 Star food or service. Will not go back.",

    "text": "Finally made me give up on Emeril's restaurants.  We were some of the first customers at Emeril's at Universal Studios here in Orlando, which was OUTSTANDING when it first opened and the first few visits after that.  Then it started going downhill - poor service and bad food.  It was so bad, we swore we wouldn't frequent any of Emeril's restaurants ever again.  Then we were in Vegas and at the Palazzo looking for a place to eat.  We foolishly decided to give Delmonico a try.  Worst service we've had in a long time.  The waiter acted like we were bothering him.  He disappeared after dropping the menus and wine list on our table.  When he finally showed back up and I ordered a glass of wine (he didn't offer drinks when he dropped the menus on the table), I didn't get it for a good 10 minutes.  If I had been by myself, I would have walked out, but my wife didn't want to do that.  Dinner showed up and we started to eat.  My glass of wine ran out, with absolutely no sign of our waiter.  I finally had to flag down another waiter to ask for my wine.  Truly pathetic.  Food-wise, I don't know where the other reviewers have been having their steaks, but I have no clue why they would say these are the best steaks they've ever had.  It was OK, but certainly not worth the price we paid (and, trust me, I don't mind spending money in a restaurant).",

As we were celebrating my birthday on our latest visit, the waiter treated us to a lovely, complimentary first course of duck pate.  We then ordered the popular bbq shrimp as an appetizer along with the lobster bisque.  The shrimp dish consisted of 4 very flavorful large prawns and  the bisque was TO DIE FOR.   Now on to the meat... it was cooked to perfection, a red warm center.  Definitely one of best steaks I have ever had, hands down.    As we wrapped up the dinner, the waiter brought out a complimentary dessert of chocolate sorbet over a waffle flat bread.  The service was impeccable.  We literally had three waiters, 1 head, and 2 assistants.  I would absolutely recommend this establishment to anyone interested in a memorable dining experience.",

From the second we got there till we left they treated us like royaly.  Ross, the manager, came and chatted with us at our table, offering an appetizer on the house because of our big day.  They even plated my year-old wedding cake top tier, frozen for a year and in a bag for 6 hours on a plane from NY, and presented it to us with candles on a small table with plates and forks.  The filet, by the way, almost brought me to orgasm with a single bite.  Seriously.... no, seriously.  It was prob the best single bite of beef I've ever experienced. What else.... the year-old cake was surprisingly good!

I got the filet mignon and my husband got the bone in rib eye.  Both were cooked perfectly and very good, but not the best steaks we ever had.

We arrive 15 mins before our reservation and within 2 mins are seated. The place looks like an art museum very light and earthy colors. The seats are a bit uncomfortable as someone also stated. They are leather office chair styled, I kept sliding off of them. Now enough of that, the food: the server: Darren comes around and gives us menus we look it over- I see what I'm ordering- the filet $48, side $9 and I also want an appetizer $18 damn $80 and that's just my meal. Now I'm used to spending this on sushi so I wasn't vexed. My poor husband who until me, wasn't used to spending so much on a meal was sweating. Ha! I'm just kidding, so to be semi fair we order the gumbo $10 split, the bread they have is phenomenal a cross between hawaiian bread & monkey bread, and it gets served one by one for each person.  Kind of annoying because it's that good but it comes out fresh so one can't complain. The gumbo is decent enough for a restaurant such as this. We order the chateaubriand $105 for a beautiful piece of steak, garlic smashed potatoes, and asparagus for two. Bam! Look @ me saving us money. This was our first time having the chateaubriand and this will not be my last, very well seasoned w/ herbs& spices and nice encrusted char. It was more than enough food for two. And @ the end of our meal they brought me a candle lit sorbet sweet treat for the bday girl. Our service was top notch from start to finish. A well worth $200.",

He said the Lobster Bisque was incredible and his steak was so perfect, he ate it all until he was nearly sick. I, however, am the writer of this review, so it's only getting four stars because my steak was not great... not as great as everyone else's at the table. The guys all got the standard filet mignon, but I tried the Piedmontese (I think I spelled that correctly). Although theirs and mine were both listed on the menu as 6 oz., mine was considerably smaller. Theirs was also truly medium rare, but mine - ordered the same way - was medium and a bit dry. I had to use the butter from the side dish of mushrooms to help eat the steak (OMG those mushrooms were amazing!!!). I was so jealous of the guys at our table.   Also, we'd heard incredible things about the potato croquettes, but they were just okay. I will say, though, that we LOVED the truffle potato chips. Mom & Dad loved the asparagus. I wasn't a huge fan. It didn't have a lot of flavor, and I simply prefer stalks that aren't reminiscent of tree stalks.   They did surprise us with delicious chocolate sorbet at the end of our meal to celebrate Mom & Dad's anniversary and our son's 21st birthday.  Oh and son and I ordered glasses of Moscato. It was the best we'd ever had. When the darling waiter told me what it was, the name was so long, I told him I'd never remember all that. He wrote it down on a card and gave it to me before we left.

Perfect for hosting dinner parties.  After the event, we all left the room so that the staff could convert it into a fine-dining experience, which they did.  The tables were set, the lights were adjusted, and the guests were welcomed back into the room for a night filled with pleasure beyond words. The night was magical.   The Domaine Serene 2014 Yamhill Cuvee Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley) was by far one of the best reds I've ever allowed to grace my pallet. Unbelievable how smooth, delicious, and perfect that wine was. If you're a wine enthusiast and you haven't had a bottle of this wine as yet, trust me, you'll be quite pleased.  Before I could get into my first drink really good, our Sommelier came around our table and introduced us to a few more delicious wines that went well with my seafood.  The food was amazing! I didn't take many pictures of the main course or of much else because after our seafood tower showed up and a couple of glasses of wine I put my phone aside and just enjoyed the moment.   The service was exceptional. The staff took care of our every need. All the guests left with a lasting impression.  I admire and loved watching Chef Emeril LaGasse on the cooking network and to have dined in one of his fine restaurants, I was honored.",

Our server Jai was phenomenal.  Our dinner began with drinks and champagne :)  For our starters we had: -Truffle parmesan potato chips, Apple cured bone in bacon, Sea food tower & crawfish fritters.  The potato chips were addicting, I honestly wanted to take some home in my purse. Cure bacon was okay, a bit too sweet for my taste. The sea food tower was amazing, probably one of the best ones I've had. And the crawfish fritters were different but tasty, served on a bed of fresh grilled corn and cherry tomatoes.   Entrees: Bone in rib eye and Pork chop. Rib eye was cooked to perfection and seasoned well. Never had pork chops at a restaurant before and this was for sure a game changer. The reduced sauced it was cooked in was amazing.  For sides we did, Potato gratin, creamed corn, and grilled asparagus.  Only thing I loved was the creamed corn, asparagus and potatoes were okay, nothing special.   Dessert: Banana pie and Pecan pie. Honestly I am chocolate person, so I did not care for either one.   This steakhouse is one of the most under rated steak houses here in Las Vegas. I don't think they get enough credit for their amazing food & service.",

    "text": "This review is written after 3 times here. So you can say, I really love this place. I stay at the Palazzo pretty often whenever I am in town so I do like this steakhouse. Granted, I've come here 3 times with 3 different parties and ordered different things each time, I'm basing my review on my most recent experience this past weekend.   We did make reservations for 9 pm I believe. We came in pretty buzzed and ordered a few things.   Shishito Peppers- Way too salty for any of our tastes. We didn't finish this.   Cheese Plate- Delicious. They really enjoyed the the fresh honey while I really enjoyed the different cheeses.  Fois Gras- OUR FAVORITE, most definitely. So buttery and tasted so good with just the perfect amount of sauce. Highly recommend if you enjoy fois gras. Can't go wrong.  Ribeye- It was great!!!! So tender and fatty. We got it medium rare and actually split this between two people. I rarely eat red meats but I always crave the steak here.  New York- Not as marbled or fatty like ribeye but it was good.  Ask for their steak sauces!! I love the horse radish one. It was just sooooo good, gave a great kick and flavor to the steak.   Corn side is recommended, had a textured crust on top. Asparagus was not flavorful, but it was the only greens for the dinner. I didn't mind it too much. They thought it was extremely weak in flavor.  No drinks or dessert but dinner was about $200 or so, might have been more.   HIGHLY RECOMMEND.",

I understand that joking about that may be a bit taboo - what people do to end up on death row - but dear lord... if you tasted their bone in ribeye, creamed corn or potato croquets (fancy tater tots) you'd second guess what you would consider moral if it meant you could devour this ambrosia again.   Do yourself a favor... bring a date, order anything on the menu... and after the first bite, try to keep the moaning to a minimum - apparently that is frowned upon with some patrons. Just make sure you're well satisfied before you get the check. It'll take the sting off.  If you get Ryan as your head server/ambassador, we highly suggest ordering the bananas foster. You'll quickly learn why we have a love/hate relationship with him. Absolutely amazing! You don't think you'll have room? Shut your mouth... yes you do...  YES (clap)! YOU (clap)!  DO (clap)!",

This review is based on my most current experience.   I came here for a private mixer/ event.  I have to give a big THANK YOU to the staff here. There I was, the pregnant lady, not being able to eat the yummy medium rare roast or seared tuna.   The staff cutting the roast asked if I wanted to have the chefs cook the tuna and and roast so I would be able to eat something. On top of that, he also helped serve me mushrooms vegetables. I was able to eat so good that night, because I was also offered the lobster bisque and other pupus. The food was amazing, even though I usually enjoy seared ahi and medium rare steak, but these are the things you have to do when you are pregnant.   my husband and I ate here before and I was impressed with the food quality.  This time around, I was really impressed on the level of service the staff showed to me and to the other guests that evening. It really shows how much they want their customers to enjoy not only the food but the experience.   Overall, everyone enjoyed the food, the atmosphere and the service. Talk about classy dining! I will definitely be back!",

I would rate this visit at 3.5 stars. The experience was not bad, but there is an incredible amount of fine dining in Vegas so the competition at this level is tough.   The Emeril's New Orleans Barbecue Shrimp was just okay. Nothing special. Shrimp was a touch overdone. The Caesar Salad prepared tableside was nice, but the romaine leafs were pale. Our filet and ribeyes were cooked to correct temperature, but a bit underseasoned. Creamed corn and potato gratin were good sides. Finished with Emeril's Banana Cream Pie which was excellent.  Service was as expected for the level of dining.",

    "text": "We dined here for a birthday. Upon checking in we were asked to have a seat in the lounge while our table was being prepared. A cocktail server asked if we would like to order drinks but we were being seated right away so we declined. There was a live pianist playing in the lounge as well. The hostess seated us at a nice table and gave a birthday card from the restaurant to the guest of honor.   We ordered a beer and the pear martini. The beer was poured into a glass at the table and the pear martini was chilled and refreshing. Our server made some suggestions and told us what the most popular dishes were. We went with most of his suggestions.   We started off with the BBQ shrimp appetizer and a wedge salad. The BBQ shrimp was 5 shrimp served with a mini rosemary biscuit. The shrimp were tender and had a nice spicy BBQ sauce ladled on top. The rosemary biscuit was nice to eat after the shrimp and balanced out the appetizer well. The wedge salad was fresh and crisp. Both dishes were great to start with and were not too filling. They also brought fluffy and hot popover bread to enjoy with butter. Pillowy soft and a little sweet.   For our entree we shared the bone in ribeye which is their signature cut of meat. It was marbled well and cooked to perfection and topped with an herbed butter. They presented the ribeye as a whole and offered to split it for us. We had them split it and the portions were served on hot dinner plates. The flavor was so good we did not feel the need to order any sauces to compliment the steak, but I'm sure a sauce would have gone well with it too.   For our side dishes we ordered the charred Brussels sprouts which were crisp and served with chopped bacon. The flavor was excellent and it went well with the steak. For the starch we ordered the potato croquettes which were oversized tater tots with shredded potatoes inside topped with cheese, bacon, sour cream and chives. Those were like little bites of heaven and we actually fought over the leftovers at home the next day. They had a large selection of side dishes that we would have loved to try but we were satisfied with our selections.   Although we were stuffed from dinner we couldn't resist ordering dessert. I had been stalking other reviews and pictures of the banana cream pie. It was a heaping slice of pie with a sweet graham cracker crust, layers of fresh bananas and chilled banana cream topped with whipped cream and chocolate curls. It was a perfect ending to a perfect meal.   I would definitely love to return and try other things off of the menu but would duplicate what we had that night because everything was so good. If you're looking for a nice steakhouse on the strip to celebrate a special occasion, you can't go wrong at Delmonico.",

Absolutely unpalatable.  * The croquettes were largely forgettable and tasted like frozen food.   * Dessert took and I kid you not, 35 minutes to be served. The pecan pie was poorly executed & the lemon trifle was edible, but not breath taking.   * THE PIECE DE RESISTANCE: I requested a decaf French roast coffee and was served caffeinated coffee. The server promptly apologized for the mix up. This could have cost me a precious night of sleep.  The staff made my head spin as they ran around with confused looks on their faces, loudly speaking to each other over the unbearable cacophony heard throughout the restaurant.   THE WORST.",

    "text": "Delmonico still ranks as one of the best in Vegas!   I used to be in Vegas every few months for the various fashion conferences, where I'd fly in from NYC and peruse the Trade Shows, dine like a champ, and party like a Rock Star.    Delmonico at the time was always one of my favorites.      I stopped through here last month and dined at the bar.  The service was great, and I enjoyed seeing their selection of Whiskey and Scotch, along with their DEEP selection of Bourbons.  Now Bourbon is not my thing, but I could appreciate their assortment.      I used to dine on their blackened Rib Eye here, but in my older age I am more a NY Strip guy.  Theirs did not disappoint.   The Maitre'd Butter as it melted over the seasoned steak was outstanding.     In Vegas dining establishments come and go.  This joint has been around nearly 20 years and when you eat here you can see and taste why.",

    "text": "\"Too much of anything is bad, but too much good whiskey is barely enough\" - M. Twain  Loaded with more whiskey than most whiskey drinkers will ever try, I think Delmonico still boasts the largest selection of whiskey in Vegas...I know they did in the recent past. Either way, there are a plethora of whiskey options to elevate your safe, Emeril, food choices while at Delmonico.   Delmonico is also home to a fantastic craft cocktail program...seriously one of the best in town...and also the reason that you should visit every so often. This as actually rather troublesome for me because given their range of whiskeys I'm forced to choose between flights whiskey, pours of favorites that you can't find most places and excellent craft cocktails...and the craft cocktails include every type of spirit, so even the problematic non-whiskey lovers can enjoy something amazing.  Suffice it to say, Delmonico is home to 5 star adult beverages with typical 3.5 star Emeril Lagasse food.",

    "text": "We reserved for Delmonico Steakhouse days prior to us arriving as it would be my family's NYE dinner. The place itself is pretty reminiscent of Flemming's but more upscale since it's a fine dining restaurant. It was bigger than I thought as it had many rooms behind the piano bar area which is what onlookers usually see and it's located in the Venetian/Palazzo.  The Food:  Appetizers: Salmon Mousse, Duck Ravioli, and Parmesan Truffle chips. The Salmon Mousse and Duck Ravioli were perhaps something that one had to get acquired to. They were still very good however, and they had caviar on top of the Mousse. My favorite was the Parmesan Truffle Chips. Honestly, you can't go wrong with this, hence why most of the reviews speak so highly of it.  Entree: Surf and Turf - It was a NYE special that included a Wagyu Steak and Lobster. It's just as delicious as it sounds and left everyone at the table satisfied with praise for the chef.  Dessert: Root Beer Float, Caramel Cake, Triple Chocolate German Cake, Key Lime Pie - all very very good and not overwhelmingly sweet. The perfect refreshing end to a rich dinner. The best of the four was the Caramel Cake - it was sweet, fluffy, and savory.  The service was very quick and waiters were super attentive. I could definitely tell they were busy that night but honestly I have to hand it to them for working so hard on NYE.",

    "text": "This steakhouse is sub par and the only reason why it is receiving two stars is bc of the great customer service they have. We ordered half a dozen oyster and only received 5. Our ribeye was super bland and the quality of meat was not very good quality for a steakhouse. The garlic mushrooms and sea bass were decent.   The only reason why we notice we only received 5 oysters was my father an I were both sharing so that meant we got 3 each. So we typically cheers when we have one and after the second one we notice and notify our server assistant and he then said ok. We wait ten minutes for them to bring out 1 oyster. It was laughable.   I never been to a steakhouse where there is the average salt and pepper sitting on the table. But I'm assuming it's there bc how bland the food is. Typically a good steakhouse does not have these items on the table bc the steaks are full of flavor. My ribeye was far from flavorful. My ribeye was tough and flavorless. Any other steakhouses on their off day would make a better steak than here.   All in all my sea bass was alright nothing special and the mushrooms were decent. I would not recommend this place to anyone. It was between cut steakhouse and here and I went here bc cut was commitment for the time we wanted to have dinner. No surprise.  I would recommend the steakhouse at circus circus, sw at the Wynn, joes steak at seafood at Caesar's or prime at the bellagio.",

Definitely get it if you like salmon! For sides we got their creamed spinach and fingerling potatoes. Both were good! I loved the garlic that accompanied the potatoes. Nom Nom.

The little touches; from our separate birthday and anniversary cards, to a little special bite from the chef, to the delicious complimentary lime sorbet. The wine was amazing. We enjoyed the decor and ambiance. It wasn't too loud and the decor, was by no means over the top, but it wasn't boring. Understated, and classy is how I would describe it. Very romantic. My husband and I shared the 20oz ribeye and it was cooked to perfection, and just enough for two people. The creamed corn corn was out of this world, with a hint of spicy (jalapenos). And the fried Brussels were to die for. Also the BBQ shrimp? Do yourself a favor...get them. But the best part? The banana cream pie! Uhg I wish I could go back in time for just that little (huge) slice of Heaven.

When you walk in, the decor is very minimal but sophisticated with arched ceilings that makes you feel like you're inside a European gallery.   We ordered the following: -Deviled eggs: delicious! Very creamy, topped with King Crab meat is a plus. -truffle potato chips: good sharable appetizer.  -New Orleans style barbecue shrimp: if you're into Cajun style barbecue shrimp, definitely order this dish. A bit different from the ones we had in New Orleans but still good.  -Lobster bisque: has good amount of chunky Lobster meat, but not the best I've had.  -ribeye: due to pregnancy, I had to order a well done steak. My steak came close to medium well, pink in the inside. I sent the steak back, it came back still not completely well done. Sent it back for the second time and the steak came back as beef jerky.. I expected at least the second time around for them to make a new one as I know the effect of cooking a piece of steak multiple times. Of course I wasn't expecting a well done steak to be juicy and tender but I have had a properly cooked well done steak before that's was not super tough! Flavor on the steak was pretty good, but could not taste the dry aged flavor as much. In the end, the restaurant took this off the bill, which was a nice gesture.  -sides: Creamy corn (very good), mushrooms (a bit salty but good flavor), twice baked potatoes (good).   Overall, I would give this restaurant 3 and a half stars.",

I must say, both of my visits have been an outstanding five-star dining extravaganza.   The restaurant was bustling for the Global Gaming Expo this past fall. We had reservations and were seated right away at a large table to accommodate our group of 9 guests. We were seated off the main dining room in a dimply lit secluded area that helped enhanced conversation and provided a more intimate dining experience.   We were promptly served our craft cocktails and wine as we browsed the menu for our dinner options. We all had a really tough time deciding on the dishes since everything looked and sounded incredible. Out waitress was on top of her game and cheerfully provided her recommendations to the group.  We ended up ordering a mix of entrees/ sides/ starters/ cocktails/ wine and sweets including a handful of Bone-In Rib-eyes (check out the photo- holy guacamole..) Bone-In NY Strips, Twice Baked Potatoes, Asparagus, Wild Mushrooms, Potato Au Gratin, Lobster Bisque, Wedge Salads with blue cheese crumbles, Banana Cream Pie, and coffee to top it off.   My guests and I were blown away by the food and service experience. Our favorite dish of the night was, you guessed it, the Bone-In Rib-eye steaks. They were seasoned perfectly with an awesome rub with hints of Cajun inspiration and topped with dab of butter. Yum. It is the best steak I've had to date. Simply divine!   The sides were large and intended to be shared and passed. We enjoyed the classic steak and potato combos and broke it up with some mixed green salads, asparagus and mushrooms. Everything was cooked perfectly and tasted heavenly. We stuffed ourselves in a Thanksgiving fashion and had a wonderful and memorable evening.   I will undoubtedly be returning for another amazing experience in the future! Kudos to the entire staff for making this an amazing dining experience!",

This year we celebrated my husband's 40th Birthday with dinner at Delmonico's and they didn't disappoint. I had the bone in NY strip with a side of creamed corn. The steak was made to perfection and I'm not sure what they do to the creamed corn but it is delicious. My brother in law tried the sea bass. He raved about it. The service here is wonderful. Their attention to detail make all the difference. In our opinion it is an expensive dinner that is well worth the money for a special occasion.",

Easy to make a reservation through yelp via open table. Confirmed.  Came here and ordered their famous bone-in-ribeye. Had the oysters and shrimp for appetizer. Cream spinach as a side to share.   Oysters: Sort of like the Rockerfeller oysters... I liked it. Not the best but it was good.  Shrimp: The sauce was Louisiana style, good but the shrimp was cooked too long. It came out a little 'old'.   Bone in Ribeye: The flavors were strong and was there. It had that distinct iron? grilled tast to it. Juicy as well but too chewy for me. Some parts were a bit dry.But it is huge!  Creme spinach: Too salty for me but other then that, good.  Food: a-ok, 3 stars. Service: 5 stars.  Why? We told them we were going to catch the show for Ka at the MGM Grand and seating started at 7:30. They made sure everything came out fast and had our check ready for us so we would leave in time. I didn't feel rushed at all, and they were glad to help us out. Thank you! :)  I would recommend going there once.",

But the service and the atmosphere fell very short at Delmonico's. I was dining alone so maybe the server didn't think he needed to attend to me but the night before I had amazing service at B&B so I had an expectation of what a $100 dining experience should be like.   I told the server I would like a glass of red wine when my steak was delivered. I waited ten minutes before it was brought out. I used to wait tables... for a decade. I'm a reasonable patron. I think fine dining demands something above diner level service.  So despite a delicious steak and a tasty martini, the rowdy classless crowd and the crappy service will keep me from coming back.",

It was tasty, I enjoyed it but nothing stood out from it.  -Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips: Guys at our table couldn't get enough of it. It was really good. The truffle oil was amazing! -Caesar Salad Prepared Tableside for Two: This was okay. It was kinda cool they made it for you on the side fresh. Small portion for the cost.  -Bone-in Ribeye: This was very juicy, had tons of flavor. There were some spots where it was very chewy but still very good.  The portion size was very big. Some of the guys could not finish it. -New Orleans Creamed Spinach- I didnt like it at first but I acquired the taste and thought it was tasty by the last bite I had. -Creamed Corn Gratinee - VERY GOOD. first item to go at our table Sauteed Garlic Wild Mushrooms- great mushrooms, hard to mess it up. but a good compliment to the steak  -Pecan Pie - First off I like pecna -Emeril's Banana Cream Pie - This was good one of the better banana cream pie I had, but the pecan pie was just too good that this just tasted alright.",

    "text": "We have eaten here multiple times over the years.  We have enjoyed the chef's table on 3 different occasions, including a family dinner the night before my sister-in-law got married.    The service is wonderful and we have never had bad service in the dining room, bar or chef's table.   The food is spectacular.  If you are a carnivore - thls is will be a religious experience.   The steaks, lamb chops, foie gras, fresh raw oysters, and   A couple of things not to miss:         Appetizers: N.O. barbecue shrimp,  truffle, parmesan potato chips         Entrees:  American Buffalo ribeye, the bone-in ribeye, lamb chops         Dessert:  brioche bread pudding, Delmonico chocolate cake  Wine List:  I swear the darn book weighs 10 pounds.  They have an extensive wine list and it can be intimidating.  I have found the sommelier  has always been approachable (some restaurants have sommeliers that are kind of snotty or stand offish) and helpful.  Adult Beverages:  I like champagne and wine but they have some really nice cocktails and I would suggest trying one or two.        The Lady Lychee      A Tale of Two Cherries      La Flor Mayor - for a little kick    They also have an impressive list of whiskey & whisky.  There are several seating areas of the restaurant, so you can have an intimate meal, a family get together or enjoy a group of friends.  I enjoy sitting on the long bench because it is comfy and I can people watch.  If you have a special event, reserve the Chef's Table but show up hungry because they are going to FEED YOU!  No tasting size dishes and they will toss in a surprise or two.  Like the time we had a wonderful ribeye main course, and thinking we were getting dessert, in walks another main course!  A spectacular lamb chop that was the best I have ever eaten.    And if you are just looking for some munchies and a drink - visit the bar.  Michelle is a great bartender and the food is the best bar food you will find.  Or need your Emeril dessert fix - pop into the bar and have a dessert with a vintage cocktail.",

    "text": "UPDATE -   Delmonico / Emeril's staff reached out to me via Yelp a couple of days after I posted the review, and I ended up having a good conversation with their Director of Operations in Las Vegas.  Mike told me he reviewed the events of the evening with the staff at Delmonico, including the mistakes that were made and ways to ensure it doesn't happen in the future.  He asked that I give them another chance and let him know when I'm going to be in Vegas again, which I most certainly will.   I'm very impressed with their response and how they took the review as an opportunity to improve.   ORIGINAL REVIEW -   One of the worst high end Las Vegas restaurant experiences I've ever had.  Dinner started out alright.  Larger party of 15, restaurant spread us across 2 tables instead of handling us as one; acceptable, but not thrilling. Initial greeting with menus and wine lists was prompt and fast.   After that, follow up service to get drink orders and appetizers was very slow. Orders were finally taken and again, return to deliver the drinks took a while.   When time came to order, my wife and I were among the first in the group.  I ordered a tableside Caesar for 2, a Special bone in filet medium rare for my wife and a special bone in filet blue (think less cooked than rare, if you don't know it) for myself.   The pop-overs are fantastic, and the tableside Caesar was great. The gentleman who prepared it was kind enough to give me a couple of hints how they do the Caesar dressing which I'm looking forward to trying in my own Caesar dressing.   At this point, the wheels came off the bus. I finished my glass of wine with the Caesar and tried repeatedly to signal our waiter John for another glass and failed. My wife got into trying to get his attention as well and failed multiple times before finally succeeding.   Rough bus, meet out of control bus. Dinner arrives, and my wife and I are simultaneously served Bone In Ribeyes. Hers medium rare, mine blue (our order was Filets - medium rare and blue). We promptly object and are corrected at first by the waitstaff that we got what we ordered (we never order Ribeyes as we both like our steaks too rare for a ribeye's flavor to come out).  The waiter comes over after some confusion and tells me he brought me what I ordered. After some quick discussion our incorrect steaks are removed and we're told our Special of the evening, Bone In Filets, are on their way.   Not minutes later, we're told they've sold out of the special and we can have regular filets. Since the rest of our group has already been eating we just say fine, whatever, bring us a medium rare and a blue filet.   Three different people drop by to apologize to us, a total of 8 times across them. Frankly it creeped us out a bit.   When our new steaks finally arrived, they sat them down saying \"here is your medium and rare filets\".  When we cut in to them, we did get 1 medium and 1 rare filet but 0 medium rare and 0 blue filets. We just accepted them and went forth.    The flavor of the filets were good, as was the texture and seasoning.   After the steak disaster, I did not have to struggle to get another glass of wine fortunately!!  I can't say the side of grits with cheese and bacon was all that great since it sat there getting cold and congealing the whole time they were figuring out the steak issue.   We passed on dessert, having lost all confidence on the restaurant. We did order a decaf coffee and a 10 year tawny port for me. The waiter offered to buy the port for me, i.e. comp it, but that seems a small consolation compared to blowing the whole main course in such an epic fashion.   Can't recommend you avoid Delmonico enough. With so many other options around here, don't risk wasting your hard earned dollar (or luckily won one) here.",

    "text": "Went to Vegas with the husband to celebrate our 10 year anniversary and take that honeymoon that had been postponed for far too long.  One of the reasons we booked at the Venetian was to dine at Delmonico Steakhouse.  We originally made a reservation for lunch on Sunday but moved it to dinner as the husband was worried lunch service didn't offer all the varieties of steak.  Made the mistake of booking for 9 pm on Monday, August 20th.  The hotel was packed with a new rush of guests as was the restaurant.  Enjoyed a drink in the bar before being seated and were then led to a small table where we were introduced to Josh, our primary server.  Josh informed us that we would have 3 servers that evening one of which would be a sommelier.    We perused the wine list and then Lamont came over and asked \"if anyone had explained the menu\" to us - a jarring question in a fine dining establishment.  We decided to start with wine by the glass as we didn't want a full bottle at that point.  I asked Lamont about a blend on the list -- I inquired as to what was in the blend.  He asked me what I meant.  I clarified by saying what types of wines are used to make the blend.  He rattled off one variety and then said \"and I think a Cabernet is in there\".  Lamont made no offer to explain or recommend any other wines.  We ordered two glasses of Malbec, our appetizer and entrees.  My husband asked Lamont if he could get a side of garlic butter.  Lamont said no - they don't have garlic butter.  Really?!  This is an Emeril Lagasse restaurant!  He asked for a side of plain butter and we sent Lamont on his way.    A food runner, or possibly our third server (he never introduced himself), delivered a complimentary appetizer of tuna atop a crostini which I enjoyed but the husband did not.  Josh came back with our wines.  We inquired as to whether Lamont was the sommelier that Josh had mentioned earlier and he affirmed that he was.  We expressed our surprise and disbelief yet Josh did not follow up with any inquiry as to why we asked the question.  At this point I had to talk my husband out of storming out of the restaurant.  Josh did not alert the floor manager of our question or our discontent.  It is unclear if this was because of poor training or due to the staff not being able to handle when the restaurant is full.  Our salad with arugula, granny smith apples, prosciutto and champagne vinaigrette arrived and was very tasty.  We started to move past the negativity and then waited and waited for our entrees.  The husband ordered another glass of Malbec and asked for more bread, which never came.  The steaks were quite good but the extra butter was not delivered.  The twice baked potato was yummy and the side of mushrooms was divine.    The espresso creme brulee and pecan pie desserts were very good and we appreciated the complimentary banana gelato with 'Happy Anniversary\" written in chocolate on the plate but it still wasn't enough to make up for the fact that our servers' poor performance ruined an experience we looked forward to for months.  I would have given Delmonico Steakhouse one star due to the service but gave it two because of the food.  We expected much more.  I suggest you go somewhere else.  FYI - Delmonico Steakhouse is a large restaurant that seats approximately 100 patrons.  The women's restroom has 2 stalls.",

    "text": "I'm a simple dude.  I'm a thrifty dude.  When you combine the two, it's a wonder when I spend $40 on an entire night out.  So it was a significant deal for me to set foot into a place where a plate of food is on par with my average bar tab.  It was a special occasion so I shelved my cheap-skate side for the evening.  Thank god I did.  My wife and I arrived early and had a drink at the bar.  The bartenders were exactly what I look for in one: chill, conversational, intelligent but not lording their smarts over you, and just nice dudes.  Our drinks were great (though I did have to swat at one fruit fly, but that happens).  Dinner was unlike anything I'd ever had before.  Here's why: - Three servers throughout the course of our evening, and all of them were great - I was able to get a black napkin without asking - The table was perfectly sized; I didn't feel like I was going to nail someone with an elbow when they were sitting next to me - My wife ordered a Cesar salad which we split.  The thing was hand-prepared at our table and it was amazing - I ordered duck.  I'd never had duck before and felt this was a perfect opportunity to do so.  I expected a breast or perhaps a thigh--not a half of a duck.  From bite one to cleaning the bones, it was spectacular -Everyone at the table completely cleaned their plates (or had the intention of doing so if we didn't run out of time before our show--not for the sake of service, rather solid conversation).  Not one dissatisfied customer  Should I come into a small fortune in the future, I'll certainly come back.  Until then, I'll just have to dream.",

    "text": "Been here 4 times now. Was in the process of making this place one of those restaurants you gotta visit every time you come into town. Well, I don't feel that way so much any more after our last two visits Service is outstanding.  No complaints when you're pampered.  But there are tons of staff which may explain the prices here. Looked to me like a 3 person team was assigned to 3 tables. Doesn't include the guy bringing the food or the floaters moving about  The quality of the food is merely average. 3 of us went, total bill was $360, no drinks.  The BBQ salmon was good, but the overpowering BBQ sauce hid the salmon flavor. My better half had the rack of lamb which she sent back for more cooking because it was raw in the middle. It came back hotter but nearly as raw. She gave up 1/2 through because of all the fat and the rawness. I tried a rib and found it average.  Costco has rack of lamb. Not as meaty but more flavorful than Delmonico.  But that depends on the chef. I had the bone in rib eye, asked for it med rare but it was mostly raw. The tail end was all fat. The flavor was average. For me, part of the cooking process is to turn a steak into a masterpiece. It starts with a prime cut of beef. Apparently, they were out of prime quality steers. This steak had no marbling, just huge fatty areas and lots of tough connective tissue. The tenderness and the tastiness you find in the outer rim of a rib eye wasn't there.  I had to saw through every piece of this steak. Maybe I had a crappy knife.  We had the cream corn and smashed potatoes, both were average.  Everything here I could have made at home with better quality and with way more flavor for 1/4 the price. So I'll leave with Foodie's Helpful hints: Start with better quality ingredients. Learn what blue, rare, medium rare and so on are. Learn the point when to remove fish from the heat so it retains its natural flavors and moistness. Don't drown anything in sauce.  Spend some time in the kitchen outside working hours, experimenting, getting the broil and grill times right. Add alittle spice to the popovers might make them really stand out. Allow those steaks to sit outside the refrigerator to warm up before plopping them on a grill. It makes a huge difference  Add fresh corn to the creamed corn. Maybe that will add a little crunch instead of leaving a baby food texture. Liven up your tired old spuds. Liven up all your food. Overall the food quality is 2 stars. The service adds another star.   From now on, we will come here only for the $12 slice of Banana Cream Pie, which is to die for unless the quality starts slipping.",

I had the bone-in New York steak medium. It had a perfect char and cooked how a steak needs to be. I am a big fan of the New York because it is a leaner cut. The bone-in Ribeye steak medium rare was what my brother-in-law had and that just melted like butter in your mouth. The creme of corn was outstanding!  The Smashed potatoes were fine. Overall experience was superb and the service has never failed me.",

I felt it lack the salt and pepper seasoning on the crust.  I ended up having to get some finishing salt to give it a little more flavor.    I will go there again if I stay at the Palazzo, but I still have a preference to a couple other steaks houses.  service was great, food was great. just thought the steak could have been a little better seasoned.",

They brought us bread which they placed individually on our plates. I started with the spinach and arugula salad, which was super good. I was glad to have had that in my stomach, since it took a while to get our steaks.  I ordered the filet, medium and a side of asparagus.  The steak was seared a little too much and tasted a little burnt.  They also topped it off with a pad of butter.  By no means was it a bad steak, but for the price, I guess I expected more.  The asparagus was good but also very buttery.  Good food, but I have definitely had better.",

We were seated promptly, our drinks came in a heart beat, and the staff was very efficient and friendly.   However, I recently had the best steak of my life in Havasu and I find that every steak I've had since then has been found wanting... My medium rare ribeye didn't have as much marbling as I like. It wasn't as succulent. It wasn't as tender. It wasn't seasoned enough. It didn't compare.  Perhaps my expectations of Emeril's restaurant were too high. But of the two appetizers, two sides, two cocktails, and steak that I had that night, the Potatoes Gratin was my  favorite dish, which is unfortunate because steak should always be the best part of the meal",

    "text": "Beyond food coma...it's food paralysis!  The itis ain't got nothin' on this.  I had my preconceptions of the food here but I put them away for a short time and figured I'll try anything once.  Dinner started with some bread with butter and munched on the truffle and parmesan potato chips.  They were very oily, warm, crunchy, savory, and tangy in flavor.  We did not make a dent in them.  The appetizer was soon followed by the lobster bisque and traditional New Orleans gumbo with chicken and andouille sausage.  The lobster bisque was really intense in flavor.  It had an almost bitter flavor but so rich like condensed sweet buttery lobster in sea water.  The protein that night was the bone-in ribeye which we split.  Perfectly cooked to medium, it had a nice crust on the outside and had a big glob of butter on top.  I immediately scraped the butter off and put it on the side but a lot of it had already melted onto the plate or penetrated the meat.  The meat was thick, tender, juicy, had perfect grill marks on the outside, and smelled floral due to the either rosemary or thyme sprigs.  Accompanying the main dish was the seared foie gras.  Yes, I had to try the duck (or goose) liver.  It was indeed buttery, silky, melt in your mouth tender and a good sized piece at that.  Like everything else here, it was seared in butter and had a salty, buttery crust to it.  As for the sides, we had sauteed garlic wild mushrooms and the creamed corn gratinee.  The mushrooms were delightful.  I loved forking up different varieties that I had no idea what they were.  They just tasted great.  The garlicky, buttery flavor and tender yet almost slippery texture makes this dish my favorite of the night.  The creamed corn also exhibited buttery flavor so much I think it was in a bath of butter and heavy cream.  You couldn't have all this great food without wine and they have an impressive wine menu indeed.  I went with that I know and got the syrah.  Toward the end of the meal it hit me.  The wall...of carbs, butter, salt, cholesterol, all in a sluggish soup coursing though my veins like molasses.  I feel my heart straining to pump the blood with heavy thumps and I feel the arteries of my wrist bumping against the table.  My body starts to get lethargic - I don't wanna move, no I can't move - as I gaze blankly over the huge leftovers of corn and butter.  This is beyond food coma, I need a blood transfusion I thought.  Need I be more dramatic?  My preconceptions were right.  On the bright side, the service is impeccable here and everyone seems to to take their job seriously and sincerely.  It is a bit of a formal atmosphere but you don't feel like you're in Las Vegas for the short time you're there.",

    "text": "too many places to eat in vegas! but, im not the type of girl who can ever turn down steak, so off to delmonico's it was  what i ate: - heirloom tomato and burrata salad: caprese salad, all grown up! the heirloom tomatoes were delicious, juicy, and flavorful. the burrata cheese, gooey, creamy, the perfect delicate match to the tomatoes. the syrupy sharp balsamic vinegar reduction made everything go POP with flavor. my only gripe was that i wish there was more basil to bring in the fresh flavor. regardless, this was pretty damn good - [special of the day] beef medallions with mushrooms and parm: the beef had a nice bite to it, the mushrooms and sauce were to die for, but i wondered if i should have just opted for a nice steak - baked potato w/everything on it [side]: cheesy perfection - haricots verts [side]: perfectly cooked string beans with garlic and almonds - mushrooms [side]: a nice mix of mushrooms, this would make any mushroom lover happy - banana cream pie: i love banana cream pie, but lets be honest, all banana cream pies pretty much taste the same, right? wrong! this banana cream pie was perfectly layered. oh man, i could have eaten this entire thing all by myself, but sharing is caring! - coffee: coffee lovers beware! the coffee is so good (french pressed) that im tempted to just come back for a slice of the banana cream pie and coffee next time im in town!  pros: - food: food was perfect. everything was delicious - service: friendly, polite, helpful. our server helped me pick out a GREAT wine in the price point i wanted - free bruschetta starter. when i called to make the rez i let them know it was for a birthday - free banana sorbet for the birthday girl - bathrooms were clean and well stocked! my stall even had a lil basket of tampons. how thoughtful! ;)  cons: - good food and good service comes with a price... but, to be honest, considering how much we ate, and having a bottle of wine, it was not any more expensive than i thought it would be. our entire meal, plus tax and tip came out about $500, which is very reasonable cause it was for five girls... it also helped that i won a few bills gambling earlier that day :P - reservations: i was able to get a rez for a late dinner, which is what i wanted anyways, but if youre planning on being in vegas, it would be smart to call to make a rez ahead of time if you like eating your dinner at the regular dinner time - loud: im not sure if its due to the dome shaped ceilings, but voices CARRIED. i guess you have to expect that though from a steak house - full of dates and GUYS  would i come again? if i won some extra cash gambling and craving steak, YES!",

    "text": "I had the privilege of coming here in honor of two fo my friends' birthdays last month. Being the type of guy who rarely eats at anywhere higher than a two $ sign establishment, I'd have to say this is by far the best dining experience I've ever had in my life, so far.  Our night started off with a VERY informative waiter showing us the ropes. It makes sense why these servers make the money they make, they are extremely good at their job and know the menu and wine pairings like the back of their hand. ..at least the server we had was of this caliber.  For starters, we had the Truffle Parmesean potato chips. These things are incredible. It's one of those dishes where you just want to savor each bite one chip at a time. SO GOOD.  We also tried the Lobster Bisque. Best Lobster Bisque I've ever had. Very smooth, rich in lobster flavor, and not too overly salty. Some fresh cracked pepper makes it just absolutely perfect.  My two friends went for the chateaubriand. An exquisite cut of tenderloin(same cut as filet mignon) SO tender that it just nearly melts in your mouth.  I had the Bone in Rib-eye. Quite possibly the best steak I've ever had in my life. I ordered it medium rare. It was cooked perfectly, and once I had a taste, I just had to close my eyes and shut down all my other senses so that I can thorougly enjoy this. It was quite a big steak, but with the price I paid and the epic state of mind I was in, I finished it knowing that I couldn't leave all that buttery meaty goodness behind unfinished.  That on top of a bottle of wine and a few sides, our meal came out to be.. well.. expensive. But SO WORTH IT.",

I even split the steak and left very, very full. The foie gras reminded me of when I ate my way through eastern Europe 4 years ago. I've had a really tough time finding comparable seared foie gras State-side until I came here.  All of the sides were delicious. I think I had the creamed corn, spinach, and mushrooms.  Skip the BBQ shrimp. It was a big disappointment coming from a man who prides himself in creole/cajun cooking.  The restaurant itself is really intimate. The ceilings are low and vaulted, so it's like you're in an underground church or something. My one gripe is that it's a little noisy because of the set up.   Of course, the service was wonderful, as expected. We were a group of 12 or so girls, there for a bachelorette party, and they handled us efficiently and graciously.  It's a great place to go if you're up on poker and want to splurge on a big slice of meat!",

Maybe I was too hungover to thoroughly enjoy my meal, but on this blurry Saturday night everything was very mediocre for me. We started off with the steak tartare and the bbq shrimp. The steak tartare was very good. It was fresh, clean and delicious. The bbq shrimp was good, but for $18 for 4 shrimps, I wanted them to be a party in my mouth, and in this case, they were not. I ordered a medium rare rib eye. It was cooked to absolute perfection. Nice crust and juicy pink center. I marveled at the perfection of my steak. Although it was slightly under seasoned it was still juicy and delicious.  Delmonico's is probably one of the best if not thee best steakhouses I've been to. Their service is spectacular and on point every time I've been. They really do hire the best of the best. Attentive but not overbearing servers.  Delmonicos puts out some amazing and good quality food. If you go, you must try their lobster bisque, it's luscious, creamy and definitely worth the calories. Potato gratin is definitely one of their best sides also. And of course, don't every steer from what you came for, the STEAK!  Emeril, you slightly let me down this time, but I still remember how good you've been to me the last times. I'll be back to let you redeem yourself.",

Having tried dozens of steak houses, this was clearly NOT a good performer.  If this is your first time, or have a taste bud for Dennys, this is your gig.  The $57 bone-in rib eye I had was so not tender, cooked raw, just poor when compared to the other non-celebrity famous steak houses (i.e. Metropolitan in Seattle).  The waitor forgot 1/2 my requests, and it was clearly priced as a tourist trap.  Nothing like Emeril restaurant in New Orleans.  Should have known that this be a tourist trap :(  Its too bad, as I really like Emeril and think brings down the name brand he has built up in the past.",

We had THREE servers: one for wine, one for food, and one for.. I don't even know, just to make us feel like royalty!  We ordered the bone-in rib-eye and the filet mignon. Although the bone-in rib-eye is the most popular steak at the restaurant, my personal favorite is the filet mignon just for its AMAZING tenderness. I'm really bad at describing taste with words, so all I will say is this: perfection. And you HAVE to pair the steaks with the house red wine. It transformed our meal even more.  And for dessert, we got the banana cream pie.. and I wanted to cry. That honestly the best way for me to describe my experience. I took one bite, and wanted to cry. \"It was the best tasting dessert I had ever had in my life\" is an understatement.  Finally, I loved the look of the restaurant. It wasn't as dimly lit was I thought it would be, which I actually was pleasantly surprised about because I'm tired of not being able to see my food. The design is very minimalist but still very sophisticated.. but not TOO sophisticated that regular folks like my boyfriend and I didn't feel out of place.  Although it was incredibly expensive, the food and the overall experience was so incredible that even my boyfriend, who can be pretty frugal sometimes, said that Delmonico's HAS to be a place we go back to EVERY year. I can't wait for the next time. :)",

    "text": "My visit to Delmonico Steakhouse was in August for our annual Wedding Anniversary trip.  A few days ago, we received a postcard from Delmonico Steakhouse - from our waiter Michael Jackson :o) What a nice surprise!!  It was just a short note to say thank you for visiting their establishment and hope to see us soon.    A little late - But here's my review....  Let me start off by saying.. I wasn't too sure about visiting Delmonico Steakhouse since there are sooooo many restaurants that I want to try every time I go to Vegas.  I think we've been to almost ALL the Steak houses in Vegas.  CUT and CRAFT.. some of our favorites.  Upon arrival.. we were seated within 3 minutes - which is a GREAT start.  People that know me are well aware that I do not like waiting.   We were directed to a nice booth area and my husband and I were able to sit by each other to \"people watch\".   Immediately we were welcomed by our waiter, Michael Jackson.  We started off with 2 glasses of Chardonnay - Light and smooth.  Since I wanted to try so many of the sides and apps.. I decided that I'd just share the steak with my husband..    Sooo Here's what we got: 1. Spinach Frisee Salad with Poached Egg and Candied Bacon Review:  I was pleasantly surprised that the poached egg was encased in Panko crust and DEEP FRIED.  The candied Bacon.. Amazeballs  2. Baked Oysters Review:  6 lovely oysters Baked with Garlic/parsley/Parmeson  - What's not to love!!  3. Fried Potato Chips with Truffle oil and Garlic Review: AMAZEBALLS!!! NOM NOM NOM  Need I say more  4. Creamed Corn Review:  Creamy, Sweet but great texture  5. Grilled Asparagus Review:  Grilled and seasoned to perfection  6. Bone in Rib-Eye Review:  Seared perfectly.  Light Shade of pink - Just how we like it.  7. Pecan Tart Review:  Amazing  We will definitely frequent Delmonico Steakhouse.  The Service, The Quality, The Experience..   Ask for Michael Jackson!!",

The table next to ours had someone on staff stopping by to check on the every few minutes, chat them up, pour more wine, etc.  Our table of six received very mechanical service. Food was dropped off, and no one bothered to ask how the food was or of any of us would like another drink (two of us sat with an empty glass from the middle of the meal onward).  Fine dining is about the overall experience, and Delmonico let me down with poor service.  This was my second visit. I tried to give then a second chance, but this visit only confirmed the poor service from my first.  I will not be going back.",

    "text": "4.5 Stars  Delmonico does not disappoint!   I had the wonderful luck of visiting Delmonico for my birthday dinner in Vegas. I was beside myself with excitement to try an Emeril restaurant!  Prior to our 8:30 reservation, we sat in the lounge to take pictures and have a drink. Our hostess came to get us when our table was ready.  We were greeted by our friendly waitress (her name escapes me) and were all seated quickly. She took our drink orders and delivered them quickly. She let me peruse the VAST wine list at my leisure and explained the specials of the evening and gave the market price of the items on the menu.   I decided on the bone-in rib steak with broccoli and bacon cheddar grits. In the meantime, I ordered a bottle of Klinker Brick Zin and our EVER observant, and discreet waitress whispered in my ear to inquire on the preference on whether I would like her to present the bottle just to me or would I like her to present it to the rest of my drunk and (embarrassingly) rowdy guests. What a professional. I won't even get into how I handled the two of my 4 dinner partners and their TERRIBLE manners, but let's just say I won't be seeing them anymore.   Finally, dinner arrived. My steak was beautiful. Well, cooked, not quite as rare as I had hoped, ah well. A rare steak seems to throw cooks, I don't get it. The sides were HUGE and beautiful. The broccoli was fresh and not over steamed so they still had a slight crunch to them. My bacon and cheddar grits were so rich and savory. I could only have a few bites of them before my stomach couldn't take anymore. Delmonico was nice enough to deliver chocolate ice cream at the end and wish me a happy birthday! What a lovely ending to a chaotic dinner!   I hope to enjoy Delmonico again soon, and with better dinner partners!",

    "text": "Why not 5 stars?  Because even though the food was amazing, I think it was a little too pricey for what they offer.  I was there for a work dinner, and I didn't have to pay for it.. but I sure feel sorry for our vendor that did.  It was a very expensive meal for the 5 of us.   Don't get me wrong.  I had the BEST (sorry Tam o Shanter) steak I've ever put in my mouth here.  I got the bone OUT rib eye, covered with melty bleu cheese chunks.  I ate the whole thing by myself, which I thought was pretty impressive, because I've never even SEEN a piece of meat that big in my whole life.  Let alone that big on a plate to eat. But size aside, the steak knife almost literally fell through the steak once you started the cut.  I always thought the metaphor of red meat melting in your mouth was a little dramatic, but it really happened.  Repeatedly.  So delicious.  We also had the BBQ Shrimp appetizer, which wasn't what I expected BBQ Shrimp to be, but still really amazing.  It wasn't actually BBQ'd I don't think, but cooked and covered in BBQ sauce that was really tasty.  Not too smokey, not too tangy, not too sweet.  Just enough BAM!  OMG I'm sorry, I had to do it.  I found the creamed spinach to be a little bland and lacking, which was disappointing, because the creamed spinach I had the day before at The Palm was fantastic.   Also had creme brulee for dessert, which is my favorite and really hard to do wrong.  A great bottle of red wine as well.  The multiple servers were very friendly, very polite and very helpful and funny.  I found them all to be very accommodating and well trained.  I am saving up to come back on my own the next time I go to Vegas. Yummy.",

Be aware that due to the way they cook their steaks you probably don't want anything over medium.  My GF hates raw meat so we ordered medium well and got a black looking steak.  I did complain and was told it was due to the way the prepare the steaks.  They did comp the steak which made things better.  I'm an appetizer man so I ordered several appetizers.  They were all excellent especially the Fois Gras dish.    What made my second experience less memorable?  MENU CHANGES!  Even though I knew how to order my steak perfectly now, they changed the appetizer menu on me.  They no longer offer ANY Fois Gras!!!  I asked the reason for this and was told they had people protesting about the item so they discontinued it.  I was so looking forward to it that it ruined my whole night.  I sub'd the Fois Gras with the Truffle Oil Home Made Potato chips and those are probably the best chips you'll ever have.  Desserts must not have been good because I don't even remember what I had.",

Truthfully, I've had better ribeye on our backyard grill.  Lamb.  Overcooked and also too saucy.  Not sure what that flavorless choux puff was about...

The BBQ shrimp was in a gumbo like sauce, but it was so good. And then I dipped the bread into the sauce too. The lobster bisque was perfect.  IT came out in a sauce pan and they poured it into my bowl.  Service was great, I think I had like 3 servers.",

    "text": "Besides having to finance your meal with a 20% deposit, this is the best steak and lamb my wife and I have ever had. The filet Mignon was ridiculously tender and perfectly seasoned. You do not have to put any salt or pepper on anything. The lamb was even better and the portions were huge (9 oz filet and 2 lamb racks). We started with a lump crab cake which had a dill caper sauce that was AMAZING. To give you an idea of what we spent, we got an appetizer (crab cake), two cocktails, filet mignon, lamb with truffle oil, side of potatoes (everything is al a carte so sides you get separately family style) was $150 without tip. Expensive I know, but I guess that's Vegas; $6 waters, and $100 market price lobster.   The only downside is that this place is LOUD!!! The way the ceilings and the rooms are built noise just bounces around so if you are looking for a quiet romantic dinner, I wouldn't go here. If you are looking for the best steak of your life, this is a great place.   A couple rounds of blackjack might help you pay for you meal. I probably wouldn't eat here again... at least until I save up over next 30 years. Good luck! :)",

If anything please save room and have the oatmeal crusted pecan pie with praline ice cream. It may sound a little weird, but it was the best dessert I have ever had. And I eat a lot of dessert!

It has a wonderful feel inside the restaurant - big and airy.  We had the tuna and salmon tartar to start then shared the bone-in ribeye.  It really was good.  I'd go back in a second.",

    "text": "We had planned this Valentine's Dinner/birthday dinner for over a week and were really looking forward to it. Service was superb, venue/ambiance was lovely. We ordered a sea scallop, mushroom and black truffle sauce appetizer- it was tasty. We both had the lobster bisque, nothing special, but very good, and presentation was nice. My husband ordered the double-cut pork chop, the size of a dinosaur. It was supposed to be medium, but was charred and a bit over done. I ordered the sea bass, but asked the chef to prepare it like the snapper special. It was thin, overly salted, and overall just not good. I am not a fan of al dente rice. I'm sure the chef prepares entrees a certain way for a reason, this just missed the mark in so many ways for me, when I had such high expectations. The head server promptly replaced my meal with a medium rare filet, in about 60 seconds. The steak looked dry, besides the pat of butter atop, the plate was hot, making me think it had been under the food warmer for some time. There was a crusted char on the exterior and Cajun seasoning, which again in my opinion was too much, and too salty. I want to taste the steak at a steakhouse, not cover it. Of all of the options in Vegas, we could get a lot better tasting food with equivalent price and service elsewhere. We will not be returning.",

The bbq shrimp appetizer had big delicious shrimp, the steak was super tender and cooked just right and the service was impeccable, servers are there just when you want them and not more.  Also, the sommelier made an excellent wine suggestion that was reasonably priced.  My friends and I liked the place so much after the first time that we kept talking about going back the next time we were in Vegas.  The place was crowned as the place to go for our annual Vegas outing.    Unfortunately, the next two times I came back were utter disappointment.  The second time, I took my then fiancee.  We ordered the French onion soup, the BBQ shrimp and I had a rib-eye.  I forget what she had as an entree.  The French onion soup was gross, it tasted like dish water.  So we asked the waiter to bring us the Lobster Bisque instead.  It took us too long to find our server though.  To their credit, they took the french onion off of our tab.  The lobster Bisque was not special, very bland even for lobster bisque.  The shrimp came out very poor, the bbq sauce tasted burnt and the shrimp were small.  And to top the night off, my steak was medium well almost well done, when I had asked for medium rare.  The third time, I went with my friends.  The wine suggestion was poor and it was tres expensive.  Also, the food was just as mediocre as the second time I went.  I give the place two stars despite the food being ok, because of the price.  Also, I think the service has gotten weaker since my first visit.  Hopefully, this place can get back into fighting form, but I won't know because I doubt I'll be coming back.",

(I wish I remember his name). We started with the BBQ shrimp and blt tomato appetizer. The shrimp was in an interesting sauce, not sweet at all. It was ok but I would not order it again. We loved the blt dish.  Next we got lobster deviled eggs and tomato burrata salad. Both were sooo good!  My husband got the wagu ribeye and enjoyed it. I got the petite filet and it was delicious. They brought my husband a passion fruit sorbet with a candle on top for his birthday.  The only negative that I can give our dining experience was that we were next to 3 different tables that were drinking. So it got very loud several times. That's why I'm giving a 4 star instead of 5.",

Well, we got all dressed up (for us,lol) and arrived about a minute or two before or 530 pm reservation and were seated within a couple minutes. The ambiance was great! Just what I was hoping for on this special night. So we peruse the menu and I decided to get the bone in ribeye and my wife selected the bone in NY strip. Both of which were touted as dry aged. We also got the buttered broccoli and potatoes augrautin.   It took a good 30 minutes for our food to come out and were given 2 pieces of bread which were light and tasty. The servers waiting our table did an excellent job of keeping our water topped off. And when our food was ready a small army of servers marched up and placed everything almost simultaneously. They all were impeccably dressed and very attentive and polite.   Well, now to the really disappointing part which is also the most important. The food. I'm a foodie. And in particular a steak connoisseur. This was in my opinion the worst dry aged steak I've ever had. Not even to mention at this price point. I've had better steaks at any number of chain restaurants. It came drenched in a marinade and was full of gristle. I honestly believe we were served a cheap choice or select cut instead of dry aged prime for which we paid. The sides were OK. But the steaks were bad. And when shelling out over $150 for it needs to be an amazing meal. Do I'm sorry to say I cannot recommend this restaurant to anyone. And the only reason I didn't make a scene over the poor quality of our steaks was I was try desperately to salvage our special dinner.   Emiril, step up the quality control!",

While the service was great, so were the breads, their cocktails were nothing to write home about and their wine selection was rigid - I had the Hemingway drink and it was alright.  The food was good - I had the tuna which was really good on itself, but the sauce was terrible. The sides were not bad. Our server really hyped up the creamed corn, which came much later and I did not see what the big deal was about. It was again just ok.  The desserts were pretty good, our table enjoyed them. I ordered the bread pudding ala mode and having had the some spectacular bread puddings recently, I did not think this was anything amazing but still not bad.  One thing to mention though - because our server had forgotten our last side order, it was on the house. tells you alot about the quality of service at this place.  I probably will try out other options on the strip before coming back here. Given that it's Vegas, there are some really good options. Unfortunately Delmonico wasn't a super memorable experience for me, but for a well-made dinner in a nice restaurant, this place is spot on.",

    "text": "Rib eye steak for $51 should be pretty darn good.  What I got was not as tender and not as flavorful as the rib eye served by our local Texas Roadhouse.  And, of course almost three times the cost.  Actually, more than three times the cost, since the entree comes all by itself, and you pay separately for any sides.  My wife's pork chop was huge, but virtually raw in the center.  The server explained to us that this was the \"correct\" way to serve pork nowadays.  Apparently we're behind the times, because we prefer not to eat raw pork.  She did enjoy the part of the chop that was cooked, though.  By the way, my steak was a bit more than lukewarm.  I kind of like steak that's hot.  The restaurant was very loud, and became substantially noisier as the table of eight drunks behind us got more and more drunk.  Shouting, screaming, maniacal laughter filled the section of the restaurant where we, unfortunately, were seated near them.  No one from the Delmonico's staff or management did anything to ameliorate this situation, and the drunks stayed (and got louder) long after they had finished eating.  But not finished drinking.  This is one of those steak houses where there's a primary server and then a team of two or three ancillary servers.  None of them were initially friendly, although the primary server warmed up a bit.  The others came and went almost instantaneously, with minimal contact.  For example, one server brought a couple of small popovers for each of us.  Almost tossing them onto plates, he muttered \"Enjoy your bread\" -- and was gone.  A small magic act, more impressive than the food.  I really can't think of any reason for us to go back, and would not recommend this place to anyone.  But your mileage may vary.",

I LOVED Emeril's restaurant in New Orleans (NOLA) and I was sooo excited but this was a let down.   I had the ceasar and it was fine but nothing compared to the one at NOLA (which was the best one of my life).  The ricotta grilled cheese was bland (but good in that comfort food kind of way).  The tomato soup it came with was good--nothing special. The dessert (apple fritters) were amazing--mini-apple crispy pies with good ice cream.  I would go back for only that.  Otherwise, nothing special and a personal let down.",

Having heard that, I made reservations for Delmonico 2 whopping months prior to my boyfriend's birthday.  The evening finally arrived when we were going to dine at this fabulous establishment. Upon entering the host was a bit busy fiddling with something to greet me immediately. When he did, he told us to have a seat in the lounge and that our table would be ready shortly. After 2 minutes, our hostess showed us to our table and even laid the napkin in our laps. It didn't take long for us to order so I got the filet mignon and a side of potatoes gratin, while my boyfriend had the ribeye and the jumbo crab.  Initially the filet mignon was quite delicious, very juicy and delicious. Getting near the end of my filet, however, it started getting dry, and I tasted the herbs and spices grinding against my tongue. The potatoes gratin were good but a little dry, I would have liked it to be a little more moist. I tried a piece of my boyfriend's ribeye and it was nice and tender, and the jumbo crab did not disappoint.  Our server(s) were nice, however I felt a bit rushed during the meal. He did one hell of a job taking our pictures tho! Overall, Delmonico's would be a 3.5",

I looked at their menu prior to stepping foot into the restaurant so I kind of had an idea of what I would like to order.  For our appetizer, we ordered two Parmesan and Garlic potato chips. I'm a chip queen....obsessed and in love with chips but this....this didn't taste that great. =/ The first five chips were good...but after awhile...it tasted WAY TOO GREASY. You know that over greased taste? Yeah...that's what I was starting to taste. It felt like they drenched the entire thing in oil and left it there for days. My party finished the first plate of that but we just couldn't finish the second plate. I definitely would NOT order this again.   NEW ORLEANS GUMBO: This gumbo had rice, chicken, sausage and veggies. Pretty good sized portion for a bowl of soup. Small eaters would be half full from this. Seriously...lol. I thought to myself...damn...I hope I have enough room in my stomach for my entree!!!  CAESAR SALAD: Typical normal Caesar. It's big enough to share with your entire party.  BONELESS RIB-EYE: You have your choice on the menu for bone-in OR boneless rib eye. I was with a fancy date and his party of four other high rollers so I didn't wanna make a mess, that's why I opted for boneless. I've got to admit...it was good...but to be technical, I would rate it at a solid B grade. My rib eye was cooked to my liking, the flavoring was delicious BUT......there were more fatty parts that I would like. =/ eh...not a big fan. But it didn't take away from the complete meal. Great rib eye...big enough for leftovers the next day.  NOTE: Three out of the six steak entrees my party ordered was over cooked. Someone wanted medium rare but her steak came out medium. My date ordered medium and it pretty much came out medium well.  For our side dishes we ordered potatoes au gratin, asparagus, mashed potatoes, and another veggie dish.  Can't go wrong with Delmonicos. Def give it a try! Be sure to make reservations.",

We arrived an hour before our scheduled reservation, as we were walking around the hotel, but did not want to wait till 9 o'clock, the time we had our reservation for.  Fortunately, we had no problem getting seated right away.  We started off with the lobster bisque, which was creamy and full of flavor with large chunks of lobster meat.

Our steak was cooked to perfection (medium well; pink on the inside, brown on the outside).   Side portions are big enough to share with 2-3 people and even have some left over to take home.  We ended our evening with the duck egg creme brulee.  My only complaint about the dessert is it was served completely cold.   I've had creme brulee in many restaurants, and I typically have had it served at room temperature, as the sugar is torched right before it is served.    I cannot express enough what great customer service wait staff provides at Delmonico!  Staff was incredibly attentive.  They have three servers waiting on you.   They constantly check on you and top your drinks off.    Like most fab steakhouses, Delmonico is pricey.  With tip, our tab was $300, but it was absolutely worth every penny.    Like I previously mentioned, our dinner was delicious, but what made our experience even more amazing was the staff.  I have NEVER experienced such great customer service.    When in Vegas and you're craving steak, Delmonico is a MUST!",

    "text": "We went to Delmonico's in the Palazzo/Venetian for a pre-theater dinner.  While nothing was bad, it wasn't a four or five star experience, either.  The service was competent, and the restaurant decor is definitely upscale.    This is an Emeril restaurant, so they have some cajun/creole items on the menu along with steak and seafood.  I started with the Ahi and Salmon Tartare.  A nice starter served with a small cucumber salad, but nothing extraordinary.  The lobster bisque arrived after sitting on the pass for awhile, it seemed, as there was already a skin atop the soup.  It was a nice bisque, about what you'd expect at a steakhouse.  The petite iceberg wedge salad was, again, pretty standard with bacon and blue cheese.  I finished with the Halibut served over what they call vegetable risotto.  It was good; maybe a bit overcooked, but I enjoyed it.    The rest of the table ordered appetizers and steaks, and while they said the steaks were good...no fireworks to speak of.  I did try a bit of my GF's ribeye, and was actually a bit surprised that it was lacking flavor in my opinion.  The ribeye is usually very flavorful, but this almost tasted like a filet; tender, but without any real steak pop and just a hint of gaminess.    Overall, especially for the price, I thought the food would have been a bit more inspired, but as it ended up it was just OK.  Not a place I'd steer anyone away from, since the menu is diverse and the wine list very respectable, but if you're looking for something really special, I don't think this really hits the mark.  There are certainly better steak and seafood restaurants in Vegas that are less, at, or a bit more than this price point that would be much better.    Interestingly enough, despite the restaurant's name...they had no Delmonico steak on the menu.  I thought that was a bit odd, as well.  :)",

I have to say something about the decor - it was too plain and sterile and I expected a little more character from this establishment.  I would have added some wood paneling or some framed mirrors.  But the food was worth it.  We ordered the New Orleans BBQ Shrimp, Butternut Squash Ravioli, Traditional New Orleans Gumbo, and of course the 16 oz Rib Eye steak.  Our side dishes included the Country Smashed Potato, Delmonico Creamed Spinach, Buttered Fresh Asparagus, and Sauteed Garlic Mushrooms.  All the dishes we ordered were delicious.  Our steak was medium rare and it was sooo good.  The meat was tender with the right amount of fatty goodness.  My favorite sides were the asparagus (cooked just right, not over or under cooked) and the mushrooms.  The creamed spinach was a little too salty for me.  They added a nice touch to my birthday by serving complimentary appetizer and dessert (mango sorbet)",

However, I stumbled on a chicken leg on the way to our table, & it was all down hill from there.  The 16 oz. Ribeye was flavorful, but overpriced, considering it was almost 1/2 fat.  When my boyfriend commented, our waiter laughed & said, \"that's typical for a Ribeye\" & walked away.  After that, we didn't receive any further service from him.  I had the fried chicken, which was $38, & came with black-eyed peas that had no flavor.  Our drinks were just Tito's vodka and cranberry juice at about $14 each.  I had one piece of chicken, & we were done.  The atmosphere was not warm & inviting, & the flavorless food was definitely overpriced.  We were incredibly disappointed & will not eat here, again.",

We had the NY Steak and Rib Eye along with the truffle chips, buttered broccoli and the chocolate cake. First the service is impeccable five star all the way.  The hosts have only a few tables and are very accessible while not being overbearing.  They have assistants that are every bit the professional as the hosts.  Was treated very well.  The food is amazing.  The steaks are quite large and bone-in meaning great flavor.  I think better than Ruth's Chris even.  The sides were good the truffle chips are highly recommended!  and the pop-overs that they start with are good if not a bit heavy.    The chocolate cake was also great.  The place is pricey for sure but you get what you pay for here.  Highly recommend this place for a great experience!",

I got better lobster bisque at Lobster ME next door for $4, I mean A Lot BETTER. Their soup was awful.

    "text": "Emeril's Delmonico Steakhouse is located in the Venetian hotel, slightly across from the Blue Man Group Theatre. To be honest, I even liked Chef Emeril much. Never cared about his shows or his cooking. Guess he made me a believer after this one night dining at Delmonico. We made reservations through Open Table for a party of 12 on a Saturday night. We wanted 6:30pm but were only given the options of 5pm or 9pm (FYI, reservations were made about two weeks in advance). We weren't about to pig out then hit the night life scene all bloated and passing gas so we settled for 5pm which worked out anyways. Gave us plenty of time to digest and chill.   We checked in with the three pretty hostesses and were offered to have a seat in their lounge area until our table was ready. Barely five minutes passed and our maitre d' came out to fetch us. Unfortunately, he wasn't as easy on the eyes as the hostess. However, he took care of us the entire night. I apologize for not remembering his name because he's worth mentioning and deserve recognition: Caucasian, arrogant looking but very proper and attentive, and had a dark humor side to him.   The establishment is quite simple but still very classy. It's dimly lit for you romantic types; unfortunately this was a bromance between 12 obnoxious dudes. The dining rooms and distance between tables were spacious enough so you're able to have some sort of privacy. You can tell that they didn't try to over do the interior design of the place. It's an elegant and clean look.  We all decided to bypass appetizers and drinks and just went straight for the entrees and side dishes. We figured we'll be pounding enough booze later on the night. After recently having some awesome buffalo in Wyoming, I decided to order the Three Peppercorn Crusted American Buffalo Rib-eye with Caramelized Cipollini Onions and Brandy Peppercorn reduction ($50). For those of you who are already raising an eyebrow, this chunk of meat was by far gamey. It well cooked, very tender, and seemed to have less fat that then regular bone in rib eye. Personally, medium rare is the way to go. I sampled the bone in rib eye from my friend's plate and I have to say that the buffalo is the unanimous winner. A few of the other guys who are traditional beef carnivores decided to try the buffalo also agreed that the buffalo was well worth the try. Not to dock the rib eye because that was still very legit.  For sides, we ordered two of the following to share: Sauteed Garlic Wild Mushrooms ($11), New Orleans Creamed Spinach ($9), and the Creamed Corn Gratinee ($11). It was the perfect amount of sides for the entire table, not over killing it yet a decent amount for each person. All sides were very delish and complimented our meals perfectly.  Everything could not have gone smoother. The 12 of us had a nice corner to ourselves. Service was top notch. Occasionally, they brought out 4-5 servers at once to present all the entrees to us all at the same time. Our drinks never ran dry and we were always checked up on every so often. The chef even sent out a sampling which was ground duck rice ball in a sweet and sour sauce. That could've easily been an appetizer order all together and we would've happily ordered it. Even the pricing was quite affordable considering the caliber of the steak house Delmonico is. I am quite impressed with what Chef Emeril has done with this restaurant. Big Props to him and the entire staff for an outstanding meal. I do look forward to future visits.",

The combination of the great food (meat and seafood) as well as the excellent wine selection (thanks Kevin) makes this a dining experience to die for.  You haven't experienced fine dining in Vegas until you've been here.  I personally enjoy the jumbo lump crab cakes and bone in Rib Eye steak prepared the chef's way.  Round out your entree with any of these delicious sides Twice baked potatoes with bacon, asparagus, creamed corn, and creamed spinach.  I'm an adventurous eater and am always open to trying new wine pairings so I just ask for Kevin Vogt (Master Sommelier) for recommendations based on our food order.  You will never be disappointed.  Kevin is a wealth of knowledge and will introduce you to wines that you may not have heard of or tried before.  The great thing is that these wine selections are of great value.   For large parties, definitely call ahead and secure a reservation.  Parties of 4 or less should have no problems getting a table with a minimal wait.  If you're impatient or hungry, you should book a reservation just in case there's a convention in town.  This place gets busy!",

    "text": "Emeril, I am dissapointed! I know you have many many restaurants to take care of, but it's your name that I trusted. I'd rather you not have 4 restaurants in Vegas but 1 really great restaurant.  I picked to go to Delmonico for  my bday lunch since I had other plans for dinner, and the fact that I love a good steak.  We arrived around 11ish and the place was dead. The service was just not good, even on a quiet day like this?!  We got sitted. Waiter wasn't rude but wasn't friendly and seemed like he doesn't want to be there. He came when we were ready to order, soups and entrees and a side, then he turned to leave, but I reminded him that we haven't ordered our drinks.   The drinks are usually the first thing servers asked!!  We were left alone in an empty quiet room. We got our bread from a different guy, who was a little friendlier.  But it drove me nuts because everytime he would put a roll on our plates, it was upside down.  The little round fluffy bread was facing downwards twice! I know it's not a big deal, but for the price of dining here, I expect a little more attention to details from the servers. And the butter was still frozen.  My Lobster Bisque was pretty yummie. But my Filet Mignon was just average. I had to add more salt and pepper to it.  For half the price, I could get a better tasting Filet Mignon at home.  My bf on the other hand had the burger, it was gigantic and very tasty. I wished I had gotten the burger instead, and it was much cheaper too. It wasn't the size of the meal that I was looking for, but a tasty meal with the service in par with the price we pay.  So in the end, my steak chowing experience at Emeril's famous steakhouse was dissapointing and tasted average. If only the service were superb, it would have changed the whole experience of dining here, but unfortunately the service wasn't there either.  Even as we paid the check and was walking out, the lady at the front desk said thank you but was looking elsewhere, why bother?",

    "text": "i often refer to myself as Queen Cathy. Obnoxious, I know. But it's a nickname that's stuck since high school, and if that's what the people will, that's what I will be.  Befitting the high standards and quality that this Queen has come to expect over the years, Las Vegas never fails to provide the top-notch EVERYTHING to entertain Queen Cathy's every whim and desire.  Delmonico's. If I were the President of the US, I'd give you a Purple Heart. If I were the Queen of England, I'd grant you Knighthood.  As the Queen of CathyLand, however, I will give you the highest honor I can bestow: Five Stars on Yelp.  OMFG this place is fantastic.  I'm a steakhouse junkie, and I am always looking for the next, even-better steakhouse experience.  My first visit to Delmonico's left me speechless, and all subsequent experiences have left me a raving addict.  No kidding.  if I ruled over Las Vegas, the land would see a very fat queen.  The service is IMPECCABLE.  I don't know how many people work here, but I've never seen my water glass less than half full (talk about food service taking a positive outlook on life! Haha).  It's like magic.  Before you even have a chance to THINK it, it happens on its own.  The food in an of itself is DELECTABLE.  I only order the boneless ribeye, as it's my absolute favorite cut (and I think the bone-in ribeye is their specialty).  It's flavorful, PERFECTLY seasoned, and absolutely perfectly cooked.  You see, this queen is picky.  She doesn't like to eat anything bloody. It's gross to her.  So she always ALWAYS gets her steaks well-done. While some may gasp in horror (how can you enjoy a steak WELL DONE?!), I say this, \"It is True that well-done steaks tend to be dry and flat in flavor. If a steakhouse can manage to make my WELL-DONE steak juicy and flavorful, then FOR SURE it's a fantastic place!\"  I don't remember much about any of the sides because I'm always too busy gobbling up my steak (and still having leftovers to go!).  Many a late Las Vegas night, I'd drunkenly stumble back into my hotel room, and suddenly overcome by an urge to grub, grab my takeout box and just CHEW on a slab of leftover steak.  It's even good cold.  Delmonico's, the Queen of CathyLand salutes you for outstanding service and incredible food. Cheers.",

I expect a lot from a top end steak house and was skeptical that Emeril's name and reputation might be trumped up, but several friends said we had to try his Delmonico steak house.  They were right.   We ordered the bone-in ribeye and the short ribs.  Both were easily the best examples of meat perfection we'd ever had - seasoned delicately and aged just right for an incredible buttery, nutty flavor that almost makes me think of buttered popcorn or butter toasted pecans. That delicate flavor was well paired with a bold garlic and cheese potato dish that we shared and a very nice bottle of Cain Concept from Napa Valley.   The staff were very helpful and accommodating - we asked for their names to request them again - we had a \"team\" including Tom Baker and Braden Guy, both gave expert advice and were supremely attentive without smothering us.   To top off the meal we had the pecan pie/tart topped with caramel and ice cream.  YUM.   WILL RETURN ON NEXT LV VISIT FOR SURE!",

My wife had the fillet minion and I tried the Cajun Steak which was just so tender and juicy, talk about perfection here. We also had the asparagus, how perfectly cooked. I decided to have a yummy baked potato with my dinner,  butter and sour cream right along with it. Delmonico is by far the best steakhouse I have ever been to in Las Vegas.

Lunch may be a little more casual than dinner but there was no evidence of it in the level of professionalism. As time permitted, the staff really appreciated chatting about food and restaurants.  I enjoyed the rich, super savory lobster bisque immensely. A meal in itself. The cajun salmon - featuring a nice salmon filet, french fried onions, and andouille hash - was prettty delicious. The best thing in this dish was the perfectly-cooked and seasoned salmon. While important to the overall combination, the cajun sauce was a little too gelatinous and as a result its sweetness was more cloying in my opinion. I thought had it been thinner it would have blended in more without overpowering with its texture. Overall the dish was very tasty.  Delmonico's is extremely formal and professional but still has the makings of a fun place. I'd have to try their steaks to be able to really give it five stars.Reviewing other food in a steak place isn't completely fair.",

I ordered the Chateaubriand and at first glance was not as impressed as my friend ordered the bone in rib steak which looked amazing. But after the first bite I was sold, the chateaubriand was extremely tender and had tremendous flavor.  I also sampled a piece of my friend's steak but actually preferred my chateaubriand.

It may have been more on the rare side, but I had no complaints. To finish off my experience I got the bread pudding. Just like the filet, amazing.

    "text": "Service was pretty good, food was pretty mediocre.  For the price, they get 2/5 stars.  I've had much better food before at this price point, and I've had much better steaks for much less (like the porterhouse at the Applebee's in Rutland, VT, for example).  The main dings are from: 1.  The steak was overcooked.  No better way to ruin a steak than to overcook it.  I ordered my steak medium-rare and it came out medium-well.  Maybe I shouldn't have assumed that a pricey steak house would always err on the side of raw, because they did the opposite.  To me, a steak that is cooked all the way through but still pink (as opposed to deep uncooked red) and having the same dry texture as well done is a medium-well, not a medium-rare. 2.  The sides weren't done well.  The asparagus that we ordered was overcooked (soft and limp to the point that it was hard to pick a piece up with the fork).  The potatoes seemed overdone (the cheese was dried out instead of cheesy).  I do better asparagus at home and you can find better potatoes almost anywhere.  The cream corn w/ cheese was good, but nowhere near as good as the divey korean chicken place back home.  They do have a large vine list.  They had a lot of European wines, although I'm not very familiar with them.  I was looking for South American wines.  I was a bit surprised that they had Malbec from Chile, but no Carmenere.    The main upsides are service and atmosphere.  The staff is very precise and they pay attention to little details like putting your napkin back in place when you get up and making sure all the plates arrive at the table simultaneously (although this trick would work better if I didn't see them swarming by the trays next to our table for two minutes trying to orchestrate the exercise for our table of 11).  Overall, if you're looking more for the atmosphere and experience and care less about the food, check it out.  If you really want a great steak, you may be disappointed.",

    "text": "This is my favorite steakhouse in Las Vegas, bar none. You can always count on Emeril Lagasse to deliver on his good name. We were in town for my fiance's birthday, so I jumped at the chance to make a reservation at Delmonico.   We arrived about 20 mins early for our reservation. We took a seat in the lounge and waited for about 3 minutes before they came and got us to be seated. Not enough time to rate the cocktail service.   I started with the lobster bisque. Creamy, hot, and with chunks of tender lobster aplenty. So flavorful, I chose to pass on the offer of fresh ground pepper. An A+ app.   On to main course. I had the boneless rib eye steak. I LOVED that the waiter asked me to cut into it in front of him to be sure it was prepared to my liking, and it was perfect! Upon the first bite, time stood still. I could think of nothing but how delicious the bite in my mouth was, and how I could not wait to demolish the easily 12oz. piece of heaven in front of me. The meat had a juiciness and flavor that even the most discerning of carnivore would have to admit was the best ever.   The fiancee had the Grilled Filet Medallions, wild mushroom crusted with Emeril's Worcestershire sauce, house cured bacon, and Parmesan cheese. I, of course, had to have a taste of these fantastic looking medallions, and they were stellar. I especially liked the play between the slightly sweet of the Worcestershire and the savory of the meat and Parmesan crust. Also an awesome dish.   Due to the healthy portions, there was no room for dessert. We were given a sorbet on the house that was very tangy, a raspberry I believe...   The service was top notch, everything you would expect from a restaurant of this caliber. All my expectations were met, and I highly recommend stopping in for the steak of a lifetime!",

I mean, I didn't like CUTthat much, but that's a diff review. So we kinda started off on the wrong foot. Nonetheless, the drinks were good. My boyfriend's mojito had a real sugar cane in it so I can't complain about that at all.  I shared the 2 person fancy-shmancy made tableside Caesars salad and can only say that it tastes exactly like a caesar salad that would've been made in the kitchen.  I ordered the filet. Ate 1/2, passed it my boyfriend so he can finish it.  The wine selection was impressive. The bottle picked out was phenomenal and paired really well my entree.  I would recommend the sauteed mushrooms because everyone ordered a different side dish yet everyone ate my mushrooms so that should tell you something....",

    "text": "Steak Lover's motto: A steak cooked beyond medium rare is fit only for dogs.  Like many a Vegas Steakhouse, I feel like the excitement and constant crowds provide easy business to this high-end restaurant and that easy patronage has caused them to rest a little on their laurels.   The service I received was adequate but not commensurate with the price level of this restaurant. The side dishes were very good. The steak was also very good, but at this price, it should have been exceptional.   The ribeye was very tasty. It obviously came from a happy, well-fed and fatty bovine donor. The unusual cajun seasoned rub was also a unique and complimentary twist. It was cooked to the requested temperature (rare), and it tasted great. My beef with their beef is simple: it could have been served with a hotter searing, on a hotter plate, and in a larger portion size. For the price, I expect a larger steak than this, and for that reason, I would probably go to Mastro's next time.   The meal was good enough that I would still go here again for another try if I get dragged along by other friends. We'll see how that goes. Till then, bon appetit!  -The Beef Baron",

The ambience is quite dim, and the overall atmosphere simple and elegant.  We started out with the truffle and parmesan chips as well as the pork trotter. The chips= simply AMAZING. The chip was light and airy, yet when you bite into it, you get the perfect combination of truffle oil and crisp potato. The pork trotter was also good, but I believe that it was better the last time I came.  As for the steak, I ordered their signature bone-in ribeye with a side of spinach. The steak came with butter on top, which I found different because not many other steakhouses included that. The steak was delicious; and i was able to finish it without problem.  However, I was too full for dessert, and did not have the opportunity to see the desert menu. Last time when I was here, I remember the peach or apple (some fruit) tart with ice cream was the best.",

After an amazing experience in December, I was so pleased to hear we would be going back for my birthday! I decided that this time around I would try out something besides steak. I knew they had steak down pat, but if this were truly an Emeril place, I knew I had to check out the other menu selections. So this time around we enjoyed the artisanal cheeses to start and I had the shrimp with fettuccini with olive oil. My husband enjoyed a trio of filet mignon medallions. The pasta was perfectly cooked, not overly dressed in sauce with the shrimp cooked to exactly the right temperature.  My husband's filets were also perfectly done and the sauces that adorned the medalions were amazing. Truly amazing. We shared the potatoes au gratin and of course, these were just as heavenly as I remembered from our first visit.   For dessert, we shared the chocolate root beer float. The root beer was Abita, made in Louisiana. It was mild in flavor yet refreshingly delicious. I could swear that the chocolate ice cream was house made though I don't know that for a fact. It was sooooo refreshing and just the right way to top off our meal.  I love Delmonico. It is by far my favorite restaurant in Vegas. I can't wait to go back. One day I hope to meet Emeril and hug him for making such wonderful food.",

They served this little puff bread with butter and it literally melted in my mouth. I have been dreaming of those since then! I chose the ribeye and my boyfriend chose the new york steak. Both steaks were seared to perfection! I chose mashed potatoes which was delicious but my boyfriend got the fingerling potatoes which were to DIE FOR. the herbs it simmered in was mouth watering!

The steak in front of me was very clearly a filet. Our wine glasses were not cleared until our dinner plates were... The steaks were decent. Not amazing, but adequate...   Restroom was dirty, toilet seat damaged, no hand towels.  A relatively pitiful attempt at a fine dining experience.",

Researched a lot of steakhouses and thought this was reasonably priced (compared to others) for Vegas so thought we'd give it a shot. made reservations but was not crowded on a Monday night. We split the bbq shrimp which were very good for an appetizer. Then we each had salads. I ordered the filet mignon which was a small 6oz serving for $50. I could've easily eaten 2 of them. But the steak was very tender and nicely seasoned. Husband had the bone in ribeye which is what they are known for. He enjoyed it. We split the mashed potatoes which were very good, but kinda hard to screw those up. We each had 1 drink and the bill was $200. Service was good. They give you nice warm rolls which were tasty. We would go back, but we like trying new places and it will probably be a few years before we go back to Vegas anyways.",

Grilled cheese was very good but the soup was nothing special.  Now the salad that i read one reviewer said the best in vegas, which is the only reason i came.  Knowing that they put anchovies in it when they prepare tableside, i was going to tell them to hold off on that once they get started.  So as im waiting for them to come up and make it, they bring it already prepared.  What is that?  The whole point of getting it is to watch it being done and see that its made fresh.  So obviously the anchovies were already in it, and since i explained i didnt want them, they made another.   I was told its a fire hazard to prepare it in the bar area so they made it on the side when i wasnt looking.  The few bites i took werent that good.  So i watch them make the 2nd salad in the hallway.  Needless to say, it was totally flavorless, ive had better dressing from newmans own, and the lettuce was in long stems, not even cut up. I was very disappointed with the salad, although the other food looked good",

We were seated promptly when we arrived, the meal started with a mushroom and creme cheese pastry.  Even though I do not care for either ingredient I finished my whole thing!  All dishes were beautifully presented, perfectly seasoned and dressed, and absolutely delicious.  The service here was impeccable. We had multiple servers and they all worked as a team. We never had to ask for anything because they were always on top of it.    Here is an example of the service, Joe was debating between two dessert wines after deciding on one, and they also brought him a sample of the other option. Bam!

And after reading the reviews I'm not sure why people minus the 5th star because of the price. In my opinion if you are looking for an amazing fine dining experience you must be wiling to spend the money. We were here for about three hours and we enjoyed every bit of it. We let our waiter know in advance that we were in no rush and he made sure to plan the timing of our appetizers and main just right. We were watching the blue man group after dinner and wanted to drink a few drinks before we left.  Every time we went to the bathroom they folded our napkins, refilled our drinks before we even had time to ask, and our waiter was extremely knowledgeable about the menu --- that alone just shows the attention to detail. In addition to the lobster bisque, french escargot, cream corn gratinne, creole gulf shirmp cocktail...:) I had the hot Alaskan King Crab Legs and my husband had the Bone in RibEye. He said \"it is the best steak he has ever had\" ( please take in consideration that we had travel all over the world).  The noise was moderate, besides I'm in Vegas and I wanted to dine in a lively and happy place not a quiet boring place.  Even though the dining room was open it is still cozy and romantic and easy to have a private conversation.    It has become one of our favorite places to go and we will definitely come back again!",

    "text": "This was probably the highlight on my last Vegas trip.  I read a few reviews from some of my favorite Yelpers about their experience in this place. Truth to be told, I was little envy, but was also very excited to finally get to go here after missing out two years ago.  I'm not really big on name of a chef nor do I care about so much about the branding of the place. Here's the funny thing.... I was excited in going to Dan Marino's place only because it was in HOOTERS.   See, it really doesn't amount to much.  My dining companion and I made a lunchtime reservation after realizing we couldn't squeezed all the places we wanted to go on this trip. We had already set up a reservation for dinner at Bouchon (at the same hotel at the Venetian) later on the night, so we compromised and reserved a table for Delmonico's for lunch.  It was an adventure finding place along the restaurant row. We had a harder time finding Bouchon later on the evening, but to get it out the way....this place is next to Aquaknox and the entrance is all the way towards the end of the hall.  The place was specular. Very classy and refine by the elegance of the look to the place. it's a bit more than what I expected for a fine dining. I guess I was assuming steakhouse in the form of Morton's, but this place outdone itself by making it more classier and upscale than any of the Morton's.  For lunch, it was casual. Not dressy as it was listed in the profile.  The lunch menu was very limited. I was almost going to be sorely disappointed because the menu's best item was dry beef sirloin. However my mood was lifted when the waitress presented us with steak menu that normally is on the dinner, but will be serve at lunch as well.   That was a big relief because I did not want to get stuck with dry aged beef. I proceeded to order Filet Mignon for myself while my partner in crime decided to take one of their special.   The coolest thing I saw on the menu was a Truffle Parmesan Potato Chip for appetizer. It was a great start to a great meal because I just couldn't get enough of that chip. What amazed me even more was the fact that it was a seasoned POTATO CHIP. Who else would be insane enough to order that for appetizer for $9?  Yeah...us!  We have gotten great service throughout our meal and gotten constant check up from the staff. Anywhere from our wait staff to refill our water and house baked bread (which included the butter with a shade of letter \"D\") to the chef who came to make sure that the steak was to my liking after changing for the better.  I had ordered it Medium Well, the chef changed it to Medium/Medium rare because the meat was excellent cut that day and I guessed he didn't want to overcook the meat to lose the flavor. Honestly, that was a good decision on his part because the steak was that good. I savored every bite and the meat didn't drip of blood. That would have been too much, but luckily it wasn't.  The other thing I highly recommend to get was their creme of corn and lobster soup. That was rich in texture, very creamy without being too diluted. That soup itself would make a great meal if they decided to offer it in the menu as a large bowl. The soup was that good.  For $70, that was a fine meal and I have no regret. Even though the slot machines that was not far away was calling me all day.  Our table was part of the wine tasting lounge. They have a few table that has an open window wall that overlooked the mall of restaurants. it makes it a nice people watching opportunity that scenesters would love. The bar and the lounge sofas are a bit high class for a normal wine tasters, but for the quiet soothing atmosphere this place presents, these things goes very well in that room.  There is a bigger dining room, but I think dinner would filled it up more. I suggest getting the table there next to the window so that people can watch you eat with jealousy....just kidding!  To my amazement, I didn't utter the famous catchphrase \"Bam!\" I might as well since I had a wonderful meal with steak that was cooked just right. if it was a romantic dinner, I would have gave it an awesome \"Bam!\"   I would definitely try to make it back here again next time when I'm in Vegas. -------------------- Quality: ***** Decor: ***** Service:**** Amenity: **** Ambiance: *****",

The steak was just OK. The sides were quite good but it is a steakhouse so I was expecting something much better. The deserts were not bad just not mind blowing. For the price, unfortunately it was not worth it.",

There were 3 of us girls sharing the Vine-Ripened Tomato Salad with the Burrata Cheese ~ Excellent!   We weren't very hungry so we shared the Chateaubriand among the 3 of us. It was a perfect size for 3 people.  The portions were well divided with enough sides and steak to go around for 3 people.    We wished we had a bigger appetite to order dessert and try Truffle Potato Chips. Can't wait til my next Vegas trip to try out more of the menu.",

Unbelievable meal . Steaks were all excellent , sides (family style) delicious and the seafood tower app was fresh and  adequate for the 5 of us eating seafood . One friend had the lamb chops and was very satisfied. The service was by far the best part , in all honesty . Frank and his assistants were all on point . Strongly recommend for a high end meal, especially if staying at Venetian or The Palazzo .",

ITs located in the venetian casino level on restaurant row on the way to the palazzo. the place has a cute bar area where we had to wait for the rest of our party but eventually the hostess sat us first. we had to sit at 2 seperate tables because we had 13people BUT they didnt charge gratuity...although we gave more regardless...  from the start our server was beyond nice and welcoming. he helped ben choose his martini, he helped me and a friend chose our red wine which was yummy and we devoured our calamari, filet mignon, bonein ribeye, truffle chips and mushrooms!!!  the bread they bring out one by one on your plate was SO soft, warm and goooood with the butter, calamari was wonderful even with olives (which im not a big fan of) it was yummy, the filetmignon was cooked well all the way around perfectly seasoned. the ribeye was a REAL winner though super yummmy and HUGGE (obviously hence the place being called delmonico...). the mushrooms were perfect and the truffle chips were delish altho a little TOO greasy for me.   alll the food runners and our server was so nice and the atmosphere like many steakhouses wasnt stuck up but actually really relaxed while still being rather nice. at the end he asked us where we were heading and suggested many different places to check out even tho we were so picky on tryin to decide which bar to head too. he also brought out two desserts with a candle for the two bday boys at our table!  at the end our table of 6 had a bill of near $450  (5 of us got filet or ribeye $45-$55) Ben F and I ate $190 worth hahahah it was a wonderful meal...in a wonderful atmosphere! check it out when in need of a fabulous steak + great wine.",

Everyone enjoyed their meals and salads/soups. We had a slight small incident with my mom who slipped as we were walking in, and every couple of minutes the manager in charge, Tyler, came and checked on my mom several times. Despite the fall, the restaurant is amazing, we were happy we choose DelMonicos for our dinner!! Keep up the great job!",

We went here on our yearly Vegas trip which we do for our half anniversary every year.  Can not say enough about this restaurant!  Love love.  There was one not so great side dish and it seemed like it was only ours....the potato au gratin was burnt and dry, not a good combo and we should have sent it back.

It made me want to sip cognac and smoke a cigar ( and I don't like either of those). This place definitely exudes a mid-western meets Palm Springs sort of vibe. You know... big comfy, light taupe leather chairs, with hearty dark wood tables and high nicely lit ceilings.   My food was good. The Foie Gras was amazing, the endive  salad was nice but not out of this world and the lamb special was good too. With very hearty servings of meat I couldn't finish my lamb, though if it were outrageously good I probably would have.   And yes if offered to me, I sampled the dishes from around the table). Of note: the bone-in rib eye was very nice and the fondue was ridiculously good. I passed on the fish. (Come on Craig - who orders fish at a steakhouse?) Between the foie gras, fondue and lamb, it's amazing I walked out on my own. Never fear... red wine was there to save my ateries. (Whew! )  We passed on dessert. So no report there.  We sat a few tables away from D. Rodman. It's amazing how grown men in their 50's will say shout out stupid stuff like: \"Yo D.R.? Can I get a Whoop Whoop?\" when they're in the presence of an ex pro athlete. Funny stuff.",

    "text": "While at Vegas, our friends out of the blue, wanted to go eat at a nice restaurant for dinner since it was fight night and all the clubs would have a long line. They made the reservations around 4pm for a 9:30pm dinner, so making reservations last minute isn't a problem.  Though we arrived on time, we had to wait at least 15 minutes to get seated, so we just waited at the bar. I thought the bar area looked better than the actual dining area itself. It was modern and sleek, with a piano situated at the far side of the room.  Our hostess took us into the dining area, where we were immediately greeted by our smiling waitress. Very attentive, nice, and down to earth, explained the specials and menu to us. Meanwhile, the busboys/girls gave us hot bread, which my Filipino friends said tasted like Filipino bread. It was topped with finely grated cheese and salt, and they loved it. Our waters were constantly refilled before it was even half empty.  We all ordered either the rib-eye off the bone ($42), or the bone in rib-eye ($46). 14 to 16 oz. for the rib-eye. I tried both the steaks and they tasted the same to me. It was dry-aged 14 days, which you could tell when you sliced the meat with your knife. Tender, flavorful, delicious! I loved that the sides were encrusted with pepper and salt. My other friend ordered the filet-mignon, which she could not finish. I loved how it melted in your mouth and it was also very flavorful. We got the country smashed potatoes, the baked idaho potato, and the roasted fingerling potatoes. The roasted fingerling potatoes tasted the best. I thought it was perfect the way it was salted. The other 2 potatoes didn't stand out to me.   Decor was minimal and sort of disappointing. The bathrooms were kind of disgusting to me because it seemed as if they didn't clean it much. The meal was delicious, but I still love Mastro's more!   At the end of our meal, one of the waiters kept coming by our table asking us if we needed help with our bill (because we had a party of 9). He came FIVE TIMES. It was SUPER annoying and it seemed that he was afraid we'd dine and run or something just because it was taking awhile for us to figure out how to calculate tax and tip and collecting money from people.  I'd definitely come here again, but after I try other steakhouses in Vegas!",

Being a True tubby at heart, I was the only one who ordered 2 appetizers lol. I had the BBQ shrimp (it's aight), wilted spinach & frisee (super delicious), and I tried the ravioli too (my friends loved it but it's aight for me maybe because I wasn't feeling like pasta).   I had the Chateaubriand for my main and I lovvvveee the Creole seasoning on it. It was served with a huge handful of asparagus that looked really fresh and mash, which tasted delicious with the creole juice/sauce. My medium-rare steak was cooked perfectly and was super delish. Mastro's steak still wins though!  We also had a side of grits (good) and creamed corn (yummy). And for dessert, as usual we had a buffet of it. The best ones (in order): Bourbon bread pudding, pecan pie, espresso Creme brulee. The chocolate cheesecake just wasn't my thing. My hubby also had their Blue Mountain coffee and he seemed to like it.   I'm happy this is a chain (lol) because Delmonico is going to my regular/Yum Yum list!!",

Everything was fresh, perfectly cooked to order, and tasted great. The service was attentive (though perhaps the tiniest bit slow toward the end of our meal) and friendly.   The ambiance was nice, excluding the \"old ladies' night out\" table nearby making a lot of drunken noise (they were just enjoying themselves but boy did one of them have a memorable cackle!) and would be suitable for a nice date.

    "text": "Great Steakhouse. I was delighted to come and try this place. I haven't heard too much about what the steak was like hear but I heard all good things about it.   As we sat down we were great by two men who were going to be our servers and our waiters for the day. I ended up ordering a Bone In rib Steak. I think it was the most expensive steak on the menu. I wasn't too sure about the size but my friends that came before said that it was a good size and that some of them couldn't finish it.   When I finally got the steak. It had a little piece of butter on the top and it looked good. I usually have my steak medium and it was perfect. I loved it. We also ordered some sides of grits, spinach and mushrooms. Those were ok to me. I loved the steak though. I wasn't able to eat the last 3 oz or so. I think it was well over 16 oz steak with the bone. I think everyone finished theirs except for me. I did notice that my friend said the my steak looked bigger. I couldn't complain at all. All in all we spend about $80 for dinner. I didn't order anything besides the steak and splitting the appetizers.   It was well worth it. I have spent more at other places and not even felt like I was eating enough. This takes the cake.   I liked how the servers were prompt with filling up my water and attentive to our needs. They would even fold your dinner napkin if you left the table. Awesome. I felt somewhat cramped on our circular table, but what do you expect from a large group of 9 guys.",

    "text": "By FAR one of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas.  I have eaten here many times for dinner and was able to have lunch as well.  Lunch was just as good and less expensive here as dinner.  What I love most about this place is the variety on the menu.  It is all typical steakhouse fare but with lots of choices and executed very well.  The typical blue cheese wedge is so decadent with large chunks of cheese and caramelized bacon, all other wedge salads will not do it for you in the future.  The lobster bisque is sweet and creamy and is a must have each time you go.    Important hint: don't pass up dessert - a True quality restaurant will have a well rounded and exciting dessert menu.  Delmonico's never fails.  My favorite is anything chocolate/peanut butter or Baily's Irish cream inspired.  This restaurant always seems to have something like this on their menu.  Desserts are rich, gooey with a multitude of flavor combos.  Just what I like :)",

    "text": "Nestled back in the row of restaurants in the Venetian Hotel and Casino, Delmonico Steakhouse owned and operated by Chef Emeril Lagasse.  Offering up Orleans-style eats in a comfortable setting.  High back armless leather chairs and white linen set tables are scattered amongst white walls with pillars and great sloping arches.  A uniquely curved ceiling provided an interesting twist on the events of the night, as I was able to clearly listen in on several conversations from other tables as if they were seated next to me.  I only wonder if they were listening in on us?  On the way to our table we passed by a wall of wine encased in glass.  It was impressive to say the least and perusing their wine list hinted to the fact that it wasn't the only wall of wine in the establishment.  After calling for a nice bottle of champagne we ordered off of the menu and enjoyed an amuse buche.  A sort of pre-appetizer, a bite or two of something tasty, like something you might get at a cocktail party.  The wait staff was at our side at all times to make sure we had ample amounts of liquids and dinner breads.  We made a little joke how I was not able to finish my meal because the waitress kept calling for my bread dish to be refilled...\"Would you like some more bread sir?\"  If she had asked how I was feeling I would have responded \"Better!\"  I would had surely thrown in an extra hundred on the gratuity if she followed through with the Python joke or offered a thin wafer mint.  I could go through all the parts of the meal but we know from previous reviews that the food is above board in the field of taste.  My only comment in regard to anything on the menu would be to the quality of the beef.  I am by no means a steak snob but I know quality beef when I taste it.  Having tasted beef from different locations around the world from Kansas to Kobe, Delmonico Steakhouse has much room to improve their quality of steak.  No matter how well seasoned or prepared the order was, if you start out with average prime beef you will be eating average prime beef and for that they lose one star.  If you do happen to stop by and eat at Delmonico, I suggest the sorbet desert, the multitude of tasty wines and the special... whatever it is.  Be prepared for the price, because this place is proud of their food.  Four guests, champagne dinner with desert was well over $100 per person.  Will we be back?  But of course!  Las Vegas is the place for over indulgences.  What happens in Vegas... along with your money, stays in Vegas so enjoy it while you are there.",

The only saving grace was their truffle and parmesan potato chips.  Although it looked like dish from the local sports bar, it tasted great.  I had the greatest time having dinner here, but I'd have to say it was about the company and not the food.  Totally not worth the money.",

    "text": "Man.. I'm drooling just thinking about the wonderful birthday meal I had here (courtesy of dearest Hubby).  I loved how the theme of the restaurant was very New Orleans/Cajun inspired.  Before we even ordered, we got to try these ox tail thingies, compliments of the chef. Pretty good.  We started with the BBQ shrimp. Delish.  I had the filet, and Hubby had the bone-in filet. According to him, it was extremely good, and he liked it better than the bone-in at Fleming's. I absolutely loved my filet. It had a cajun spice flavor, and it was so good that I didn't even want to dip it in Emeril's version of A1 sauce (yeah.. it's an Emeril restaurant.. didn't know that till I looked at the menu, and I admit initially I was a little turned off by that).  We shared asparagus and mushrooms as sides, and their mushrooms were superb. They didn't use the button mushrooms that most steakhouses use. Instead, I think they were shiitake mushrooms, or some sort of mushrooms that tasted similar/looked similar to shiitake mushrooms. Either way, very good.  We ended the meal with a complimentary sorbet that was yum, and we also ordered their dessert of the night, which was a blackberry cheesecake that was yum as well.  Lastly, according to Hubby, they had a great wine selection.",

    "text": "Oooohhhhhhhhhhh this place is orgasmic!  I can't even begin to tell you how in love I am with this establishment.  It's amazing.    The boyfriend and I were in Vegas for our anniversary and he made reservations at Delmonico.  I was excited :)   When we were being lead to our seats, we oohed and awwed about how beautiful the restaurant was.  The ceilings and structure reminded us of the Conciergerie in France.  Very pretty.    Anyway, we were seated and given a very extensive wine list--some wines upward of $3000.  We opted for a glass of wine.  We opened the menu and no more than 5 minutes later, we knew exactly what we were going to order--scallops and gnocchi in basil butter sauce, lobster bisque, and two bone in ny strips cooked medium rare.  No sides--we wanted the beef.    About 10 minutes after we ordered, the waiter brought out a complimentary amuse-bouche.  Two puff pastries with bleu cheese mousse and walnuts.  They wanted to wish us a happy anniversary! How wonderful is that?  My bf was very surprised--when he had booked the reservation they asked him if it was for a special occassion.  He was very surprised they did something about it.  Well, it was delicious.  Now we were even more enthusiastic about the food.  The lobster bisque came next, and it was fantastic.  Creamy and perfectly seasoned.  The scallops (2 huge scallops to be exact) came next and were wonderful.  Perfectly seared on the outside and tender on the inside.    And the steak...oh boy.  It's huge!  It came out seared on the outside with a dollop of herbed butter.  I couldn't wait to get at it. It was perfectly red on the inside.  This was hands down the best steak I've ever had in my life.  It was seared so perfectly, that the fat around the edges of the steak were crispy (yes, I actually a good helping of the fat. It's better than butter!)  The food was amazing and we ate as much as we could--leaving behind almost nothing at all.    Still, we wanted dessert.  Pecan pie a la mode with caramel sauce. Fanfreakingtastic!!!  Delicious! The waiter told us it was the best pecan pie he had had in his life, and I concur.  Yummy!   I only have high praises for this place.  Aside from the food, the staff was attentive and gracious.  We can't wait to go back--even if the $200 bill hurt a bit.",

    "text": "The original New Orleans Delmonicos gave me some of earliest foodie education.  WAY back before it was bought by Emeril, it was a Garden District favorite.  Many of the old, wealthy families of New Orleans dined there.  It was not on the tourist trail.  I was distraught when Emeril bought Delmonicos.  I thought he was cheesy and obnoxious, and I just knew he was going to ruin this Southern matriarch.  I could not bring myself to go there and view the damage.  Then I found out a Delmonicos had opened in Vegas.  Who cared if it is cheesy I thought...we're in Vegas, home of cheesiness!  So, Sugar Bear and I checked it out in 2001.    We were delighted to see that there was a strict dress code.  Our meal was splendifferous.  The presentation--stunning.  The restaurant--breathtaking.  I could not believe it!  Delmonicos had not been ruined by Emeril after all.  He had taken my favorite old school restaurant from New Orleans and made her into a youthful Southern Belle again.  We were dazzled.  We returned to Delmonicos a year later to celebrate our wedding.  Perfect.  We've been several times since, and have always loved our meals.  It has been disappointing that the dress code has become lax.  Last time we were there, we saw jeans and shorts.  Downgrade for a place that previously required a coat.  I guess dress codes don't really fly with the younger crowd, and this Southern lady has had to ride with the times.    If you are in Vegas, or New Orleans, this is not a place to miss!",

We went there for New Years Eve 2011/12 and were very disappointed to find that there were no decorations at all, and nothing had been done to bring out any kind of party atmosphere. The food was OK, but what really let the restaurant down was the service. Our waiter did not know the cocktail list. We had to spell the names of the cocktails we wanted for him to be able to order them for us. Same went for the wine, and once we got the wine, he didn't poor it for us a single time throughout the night, not even to taste when he first opened the bottle. Clearing the table was slow, and no one came to offer dessert, coffee or anything else after we had finished our main course. Getting the bill also took some time, and not a single person acknowledged us when we got up to leave, not a \"thank you\" or even a \"good bye\". We felt like we were being ignored, or forgotten, as we could see the people at the table next to us being looked after a lot better than we were. There was no reason for them to treat us this way. I work in service myself and I always make a point to be nice, pleasant and polite when at a restaurant, and if an honest mistake is made, I am normally very forgiving, but this was too much. We expected much better and I would not recommend this restaurant at all.",

    "text": "Went here for our 1 year wedding anniversary and we were very pleased with our visit with some exceptions...  We ordered:  Appetizer: Calamari I liked it, but it was way too much for 2 people.  I think I could have done it without the olives - I let the husband order this one.  I would have picked something different.    Salad: It was the special - arugula, figs, and mousse foie gras The husband was a bit iffy, but because I let him pick the appetizer, he couldn't say much.  Holy crap, that was a yummy fricken salad even the husband liked it!!  I would so order that again.  Main Courses: husband - bone-in ribeye.  me - bone-in new york steak. BOTH were yummy!  They were both cooked to order.  The only thing we didn't like about it was the butter that came on top of both of them.  We didn't think it was neccessary.       Side dish: Fingerling potatoes with halves garlic.   This was a waste.  We didn't really eat any of them because they were way too salty.  I love me some salt too, but it was just way too much for heart to handle.  We should have asked for something different, but I didn't want to wait.  We did have a show to catch.  Thumbs up: They did recognize our anniversary and gave us a complimentary dish before our salad came out.  I forgot what it was, but it consisted of a chip of some sort, with a slice of beef on top.  It tasted it like it had ginger, soy, and some more stuff and also sesame seeds.  It was really good!  I wish we had more or could have swapped it out with the calamari.",

    "text": "So, I've always thought Emeril was a lot of talk and no action, but I was wrong to judge without experiencing Emeril's cooking.   On our first night in Vegas, we made last-minute reservations for 9:30.   The restaurant is in kind of a weird place.  It's literally in the corner of the basement.  Granted, there are restaurants next to it, it still felt like it was at the edge of the earth.   Inside is relaxed.  It's dimly lit and the ceilings are low (again, more basement feel), but overall, it's very nice.  We were starved, so we went right to the entrees, but they were delicious.  My boyfriend, the meat-eater in the group, had the filet, which he claims is the best cut of filet he has ever had.  He says it was cooked to perfection and it was absolutely perfect.  And, he's had quite a few steaks.  I had bacon-wrapped sea bass with pesto, roasted tomatoes, and some potato goodness, that I can't remember.  I mean, in all honesty, I wasn't expecting to be impressed, so I didn't pay much attention to the intricacies of the dish.  But, it was amazing.  The fish was cooked perfectly, the flavors were a perfect compliment to each other.  It was perfect.    And, for dessert, we shared the banana cream pie, which I knew was legendary, and quite frankly, it was the only thing that disappointed me.  It was good, but I think I expected more.  Regardless...this was a great meal, and well worth every penny.  5 stars for food, minus one for weird location and ambiance.",

    "text": "2012 Fall Restaurant Week Lunch #2.   Whether you're visiting Delmonico on a regular night, special occasion, or during Restaurant Week as I did, from the amazing lunch I had with extraordinary service and exceptional food, I'd recommend it to anyone. 4.5 stars at least.  We seem to be the first party seated for lunch. Our two servers worked well together, being knowledgeable, catering, and attentive from beginning to end. Even as more customers started to come in and they had more to attend to, they still did an amazing job making sure we were taken care of.  What we put in our tummies: (pictures posted)  1st Course Traditional New Orleans Chicken & Andouille Sausage Gumbo  2nd Course Butternut Squash Ravioli Prime Cheeseburger w/ Bacon  3rd Course Emeril's Banana Cream Pie Pecan Pie  I'm no expert on gumbo, but I found it very tasty. Still steaming in individual serving pots, it was poured over rice table-side. Very nice touch. The burger was an enormous 11oz, well-seasoned, cooked medium as requested, hearty and meaty as burgers should be. Fries were just...fries. It was my first experience with butternut squash ravioli, and I loved it. Sage brown butter, toasted hazelnuts, and parmesan cheese made these raviolis sweet and flavorful.  The highlight of the food was unquestionably the desserts. I never order banana cream pie, but I'm a big believer in trying whatever is the signature item, especially when it's written \"Emeril's Banana Cream Pie.\" I'm sure it's not made very traditionally, but OH MY GOSH. Made with sweet bananas, the pie filling felt more like a cheesecake. Topped with chocolate shavings, amazing crust, this dessert will be what I think of from this day forward when anyone says banana cream pie. You think the way I described it, how could the pecan pie even compete?! Well, it did! Served warm and moist, it was decadent and comforting.  I was beginning to wonder if the Restaurant Week event and menus were affecting my experiences at these places I've been eagerly wanting to try. I was very excited to participate, awaiting delicious gourmet food at a great price at a fine-dining establishment, helping a worthy cause.   Personally, I'm very happy to say Delmonico made me want to become a repeat customer, again and again. It's so hard not to give 5 stars, but I would want to experience dining here on a non-Restaurant Week to confidently say it was as amazing as I remembered this lunch.   I'm very much looking forward to coming back. And soon!",

Price for the ribeye is average for a steakhouse. Ordered it medium-rare and came in a bit over cooked. I didn't find much of the broiled flavor to it.   Service: (3/5) - \"Not worth the $100 gratuity..\" The waiter was not very sociable and a bit to dry.

The first time we needed him it took us a while to get him, and the second time I couldn't wait anymore and directly stood up to find him.   Environment: (5/5) \"the best amenity in this restaurant\" Pretty decor. Well dressed staff. Nice colors. Very comfy.I'm",

And don't skimp on the sides, order at least 2-3 even if it's just for a party of 2.  I loved the caesar salad.  There's something nice about slicing your own leaves of romaine in a salad.  The service here is nice and efficient.  It's what you would expect when dining at a restaurant of this calibre.",

    "text": "I stumbled into Delmonico Steakhouse after going to the wrong place as suggested by my friend. He told me to go to Emeril's in Vegas, so I did. However, the only place that houses Emeril's name is the Fish House.  My friend challenged me that Demonico had the best Caesar salad after I claimed I had found the holy grail. So I had to try it here. First off, they make it from scratch, tableside here. They even have you inspect it before putting salad in.  Previously I thought I had good Caesar salad, but this was on a different level. The salads that I've had before were either good or bad. The flavor was just that. however this salad actually had *waves* of flavor. you could distinctly taste the pepper fade in and out, the egg fade in and out, sardines fade in and out, and other flavors until it mellowed out on your palette. WTF, are you serious? I didn't even know salad dressing could do that. I give the salad a 5/5  My lady and I shared the lamb. I am not a huge lamb eater because I generally find it too fatty and I don't like fatty texture. This was good though and I did enjoy it all. It could have been a little more charred on the outside as I found that part to be the most tasty. I probably would have been better off with something a little more traditional like steak, I suppose. I'll give them lamb a 4/5  For dessert I got this cheesecake that was akin to a smore. It was seriously yum. I was stuffed before I started it, and I still ate it - it was that good. I will give it a 5/5.  What was magnificent with this place was the service. I am very particular with service and how often the service visits your table. I was a little scared at first of this place when they announced that we would be attended by three different people. Of crap I thought, they are going to be down my throat every bite. But really, they worked it like a charm. They came when they needed to and didn't come when they didn't need to come - all three of them. My water was constantly full as well. I really appreciated this.  I want to go back here next time I am in town and do a few things differently. First, don't eat 3 hours before arriving. I was not all that hungry when I arrived and I felt like I was doing myself a disservice. Second, try something more to my liking such as chicken or steak. I have to give it a 4.5 but yelp doesn't allow a half mark. I feel that the main part of the meal was the weakest which is the main reason you are there so I am rounding down to 4-stars. Maybe if I enjoyed the main course a little more (not that it was bad) then I would have given it a straight 5-stars.  I'll be back.",

We had a hair in our dessert and our waiter brought over the manager, comped the dessert and gave us another dessert on top of that! The caramel cake and the creme brulee were good ways to end the night.  Honestly, I want to live in the steak.",

    "text": "Been wanting to go here for a long time so when a media contact/vendor asked me to lunch here I didn't hesitate!  The ambiance was lovely, low light, tasteful decorations, great big leather chairs.  We had water, bbq shrimp, lobster sliders, steak medallions with side of garlic mashed, chocolate layer cake with coconut ice cream for dessert.    BBQ shrimp was delicious!  Had a homemade bbq sauce that was just tangy, sweet and rich enough.  Large shrimp came with about five I think very yummy.    My entree was the something something steak medallions - (sorry it's not on the lunch menu online and I can't remember exactly what it was called) it was EXTRAORDINARY.  I think after looking through the photos they were the Filet Mignon Medallions - I am a red meat junkie and before this Carnevino was the best steak I ever had - this one ranks right up there.  Perfectly medium rare, flavorful with delicious meaty mushrooms, and as tender as a steak could be.  Just delicious.  Be warned it doesn't come with ANYTHING - just the meat so be sure and order a side dish or two.  I ordered the garlic mashed potatoes which come in this cool metal pan/dish thing.  They are a very large portion so that was good.  The mashed potatoes were soooooooooooooo creamy.  Very very good.    We ordered the chocolate layer cake with coconut ice cream for dessert.  This is why I gave only four stars - the cake a'ight.  Nothing special.  It was enormous though so you'll get the bang for your buck.  My sister is a pastry chef so I might be a little extra picky on my dessert but there you have it.    For what we ordered plus my vendor ordered an additional 3-scoop bowl of coconut ice cream on the side it came to $91.  It's pricey - so be sure to eat the warm bread they give you at the beginning so you can be full, lol.  But the portion sizes were generous, the service was INCREDIBLE and the food delish.",

The price is decent for an upscale dining restaurant.   I tried other dishes my friends got and they weren't as good. My friends didn't really enjoy their filet mignon. I tried the pork chop and I thought the sauce was very salty. The bacon appetizer was good but tasted a bit salty as well. The creamed corn was very good but I didn't really like the bread crumbs on top of it. The creamed spinach was just ok. The potato side dish was just ok too.   If you have an occasion you are celebrating they give you a sorbet. They also gave us a small mousse type dish for being there for the first time so that was nice. The decor is simple and had a nice ambiance. It's a nice place to try in Venetian regardless.",

That being said, I expect a great steak at any steakhouse I go to, so that's not enough to make this my best meal ever.  However, the sides and dessert we equally amazing! The creamed spinach is unlike any other I've ever had, the mushroom were succulent, and the football sized baked potato really hit the spot.  The service was great, the ambiance is perfect, and the chairs and tables are very comfortable.  I wish I could come here more often.

I had the bone-in ribeye, and it was a serious steak. I cook a dry-aged steak from my local butcher pretty well. I'll satisfy any friend of mine with that, and I'm always happy with my work. This steak was just long beyond anything I could have made. Great quality meat, wonderful seasoning, perfect crust, cooked to perfect medium rare.  Their special Mai Tai is really, really good. If you want an appetizer, the heirloom tomato salad we had was amazing, drizzled with balsamic, oil, and mozzarella. Also really enjoyed the parmesan truffle oil chips that our friends ordered.  Expensive, but one of the few meals I've had that can justify this kind of price.",

    "text": "Steakhouses in Vegas are like Starbucks in the USA... they're everywhere. If you're passing by a nice restaurant in a hotel casino, there's a good chance that it's a steakhouse. Maybe Vegas has figured out that eating an expensive steak will make you feel better despite the fact that you just lost hundreds of dollars...  Some friends and I had lunch at Delmonico's this past weekend and we got there right when it opened for lunch. We were their first customers and spent most of our lunch being the only people in the restaurant. Therefore, I guess it's no surprise why we got such great service. We made small talk with our servers and they were very pleasant and attentive throughout our entire meal.  One friend who has been here before was raving about their lobster bisque and banana creme pie. I got to try their lobster bisque ($16) and thought it was good but I'm no connoisseur of bisque.  The bisque comes with scrumptious pieces of lobster and it was very rich and creamy. I ordered the Filet of Beef Medallions ($21) and they were super tender. Although they were covered in bread crumbs and a mushroom type sauce, the medallions were quite delicious. The entree isn't very big and I was still hungry afterwards so I suggest getting this alongside an appetizer. I got a bite of the Banana Creme Pie and not only did it look amazing, the taste of it was delightful.   Delmonico's is a surprisingly huge restaurant. I hope their dinner draws in a larger crowd that it does for lunch or else much of their space could be put to better use. The lunch menu is rather limited but it's priced right with the most expensive entree being only $21. All in all, pretty good food and extremely good service. You gotta try that Banana Creme Pie!",

I had made a reservation, and when we arrived, we were greeted numerous times from several different people offering congratulations on our anniversary.  This made everything seem special for my wife, who had no idea we were coming here.  Then we were taken to our table.  We were given a near endless wine list (book!) and expected to decide from there?  No, the sommelier came over and determined our wine for us, and did not pick the most expensive bottle, but one of the best ones we have had, for way less than the next closest we had drank a while back.  The menu is not too over the top, but just right.  I wanted to have the escargot, but my wife cannot bring herself to eat this, so we had the BBQ shrimp.  Being from Texas, we love barbeque, but this was different, and superb.  Four huge shrimp covered in a sauce that I have never had the likes of before.  Our main entree was the Chateaubriand cooked tableside.  I enjoy my steak rare to med-rare, but my wife does not like to see blood in her steak. (I know, I'm working on this)  They were able to cook the same piece of meat to my liking as well as hers and it came out perfect.  Not a thing was left on either of our plates.   We concluded the meal with two desserts, I had Emeril's banana cream pie.  An incredible end to a wonderful meal.  My wife had the creme bruele,  and explained it in details I have never heard her use to explain food.  On top of this, we were given a small sample of sorbet with a happy anniversary not written in chocolate on the plate.  There were so many waiters and helpers taking care of our every need that it was almost impossible to say who was the actual waiter, although the main waiter was superb.  He took over for the cook at our table because he knew exactly how we wanted the steak, and never did he let anything sit out of place, no drink ran low, and not one thing was missed.  Again, amazing can not explain how great this meal was.  We will definitely stop again next time we are in Vegas!  I knew how much it would be before we went, but for the sake of a review, I will say our meal for two was right at $300, but well worth it.  If you are looking for a fine dining restaurant and not wanting to spend this much, then you aren't really looking for fine dining.",

My husband had the bone- in NY strip,medium rare, it was grizzly and very chewy, not worth a price tag of $50. I had the petite Piedmontese filet mignon, 6oz., although extremely small for $50.00 it was very good. We were then given a small scoop of complimentary blood orange sorbet and finished the meal with the pecan pie, good but not memorable.

We chose to go to Delmonico Steakhouse because when we first began dating our first real date was at Emeril's in Vegas.  We booked a reservation via open table for 5 pm, we arrived around 4:30 and was told they would begin seating at 5 and we could wait in their lounge area.  Our servers were Ryan and Anthony and they did a spectacular job making us feel welcome and catering to our needs.  I had the bone in Rib Eye and my wife ordered the Rack of Lamb both were dialectic and cooked how we ordered them. We also had the creamed spinach and fingerling potatoes.  The creamed spinach was very good.  To top it off because I had mentioned it being our anniversary on OpenTable when I booked the reservation we were surprised to receive a special little tasting to begin our dining experience and a scoup of their chocolate gellato for dessert.  Overall it was a great evening to remember.",

We were dressed very casually (it was, after all, a day trip) and worried we might be treated differently at an elegant restaurant like Delmonico Steakhouse. We were wrong. From the moment we walked in, we were treated with the best service possible.   The wine list is extensive, as is the dinner menu, which offered great courses for our varying palates. I enjoyed a filet with \"Oscar\" and it was absolutely fantastic! My colleagues were all very impressed as well.   We were also quite impressed by the staff, who were willing to \"rush\" things for our table, as two colleagues had an earlier flight back home. Excellent food, service, and ambiance will ensure I come back here next time I'm in town.",

    "text": "A friend and I came here a few nights ago, and upon walking in without a reservation we were accommodated immediately. Score! I think we got lucky since it was only 6ish but I recommend making reservations, especially as it was packed when we walked out by 7:30.  Our waiter was incredibly helpful as we sorted through the menu and wine items. I ended up getting the porkchop while my friend got the bone-in ribeye. We also shared the cream corn and garlic smashed potatoes. Our food was served quickly and the red wines we ordered were fantastic - the Tobin James was darker than I usually like it but rich and paired very well with the ribeye. My Meiomi was a bit lighter and fruitier but was a great recommendation for its price.  Be prepared for a BIG meal, the slabs of meat are huge and we barely got through half of our sides. So come hungry! Both the porkchop and ribeye were delicious - flavorful, tender, and juicy. Several waiters came by to check on us which was appreciated.  The only reason I'm docking a star is for the decor - a bit plain and out of the 90s. Lighting is perfectly dim but hopefully they renovate to match the prices. To be clear though, this is not a reason to not come - the dinner will be worth it!",

    "text": "My wife and I came here for our anniversary celebration last week. We had a show to attend at the Wynn so we needed to dine locally; I was debating on dining at CUT again or here but due to the high yelp reviews we decided to give Delmonico's a try.  I made reservations one month in advance online and notated our special occasion.  Upon entry we were both promptly greeted, seated and our anniversary celebration was acknowledged - which was much appreciated. Service was kind, professional and very efficient but unfortunately the food - lacked significantly.   We both began with the recommended BBQ Shrimp appetizer - which was phenomenal, but unfortunately that's where our ecstasy of taste buds had ended.  I ordered my long awaited alleged highly reviewed bone in rib eye with a side of foie gras, mashed potatoes and sauteed mushrooms.   To my unfortunate disappoint - the steak had tasted no different than a steak purchased from your local grocery store. For the price point and most importantly the anticipation I had for their signature steak from the world renowned chef, it DID NOT hit the spot. Although the steak came out at a perfect temperature and presentation was adequate, it did not at all taste like a typical dry aged high grade meat - very bland and mediocre, tasted no seasonings or flavor. We should have gone to Mastros or I would have at least been better off going back to CUT, although I didn't like the fact that CUT brings out their steaks lukewarm (due to resting) or not even on a hot plate - but you definitely get the high end meat quality and the explosion of flavors - hands down by far is 100% better.  My wife had ordered the Mediterranean Sea bass since she wasn't in the mood for steak and as well to her disappointment it was a lackluster, flavorless dish. All in all it was a very disheartening anniversary meal after a month's of high anticipation especially with all of the other fine dining options we had in Vegas.",

Excellent service!! We both had the Filet Mignon, medium well it was very tender and tasty. We were saved by this place in having a great birthday dinner and they got us out on time to get to our Circus Soleil show. This place can be loud, they may have seating in a more quiet area of the restaurant, but highly recommended as one of the best of Las Vegas and a delicious dinner is probably a guarantee.",

    "text": "What better place to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday and Yelp Spring Break than in Las Vegas! I wanted to surprise my bf so I made reservations through open table for dinner at Delmonico. When we arrived the hostess wished my bf a happy birthday and we were told to have a seat in the waiting room. Wow that waiting room was super nice but also packed! Lucky for us as we turned around to scan for a seat the hostess called my name and said our table was ready.  Upon being seated we were greeted by our server. He also wished my bf happy birthday and took our drink orders. When the waiter returned with our water he also brought some warm, soft, honey rolls the melted in our mouths. We decided to start with the Petite Iceberg Lettuce Wedge salad followed by a Twice Baked Potato ($9) and Rib-eye ($48) for me and Short Rib Special ($35) for my bf. Before our salads came out the waiter brought a small appetizer for us to share- compliments of the chef. I don't remember what exactly it was but it was so delicious!  The wedge salad ($13) was composed with petite iceberg lettuce wedges and topped with apple smoked bacon and red onion with buttermilk blue cheese dressing. There was A LOT of crumbled blue cheese on the salad- almost a little too much for me. It was enough for both of us to share and enjoy before we got our steak knifes and forks ready for what was to come next.  I wish I were hungrier at the time- my rib-eye was HUGE! After the rolls and salad my steak and bf's short rib looked almost impossible to finish and it was quite a challenge. The rib eye was thick, juicy and tender- served with a slice of melting butter on top. Every bite felt so sinful as it tasted so good despite how full I was I couldn't stop indulging in more. I tried my best to eat my half of the twice baked potato. It was really smooth and rich with bacon and Vermont cheddar.  I can't say much about my bf's short rib since I was too busy trying to finish my ribeye. I know he really enjoyed it and the meat was so tender it fell apart with a light brush from his fork.  After dinner the server brought my boyfriend a complementary scoop of banana sorbet for his birthday. He likes bananas but usually doesn't like banana flavored foods. The sorbet was so fresh and smooth he actually really enjoyed it and finished! With a food coma coming on and $115 later we postponed surprise #2 (dessert at Serendipity) and cabbed back to our hotel and called it a night. Who does that in Vegas!?!?   P.S. I can't wait back to try the Creekstone Farms Naturally Raised Angus, Carved Tableside for Two with Asparagus and Garlic Smashed Potatoes. Time to start saving up again...",

I ordered the ribeye to share along with the best lobster bisque you will ever have. Also the truffle potato chips are to die for. The restaurant is very classy and a bit pricey, however, you get what you pay for. I've tried pretty much all of the restaurants at the Venetian, and I have to stay this one is my absolute favorite. The steaks come out a perfect medium rare cooked to perfection in butter.  Since this is a popular restaurant, I highly recommend making a reservation in advance.

It is huge and enough to feed two people.  Needless to say, my party of 4 ordered way too much food.  We had two bone-in rib eyes ($55 each, probably about 20 oz. each), the flounder ($40), BBQ salmon ($36), sauteed mushrooms, asparagus and mashed potatoes.  The only thing I wasn't crazy about was the mashed potatoes.  It had a pasty texture to it.  I prefer my mashed potatoes fluffy.  We topped off the night with a slice of the banana cream pie.  OMG -- I had it three years ago on another visit and hadn't stopped thinking about it.  I wish we hadn't ordered so many entrees so I could have had my own slice!  We asked for both steaks to be cooked medium.  It was a PERFECT medium!  I seriously can't wait to go back to Vegas.  Emeril never disappoints so I find myself frequenting all of his establishments in the city.   P.S.  The lobby area is nice.  Lots of seats and big screen TVs.  We topped off the night by watching the end of the USC-Nebraska Holiday Bowl game.  Go Trojans!  We won... barely.  Phew.",

My steak came out perfect. And all the sides, especially the creamed spinach and mushrooms, were great as well.  I would love to come back to this place again. The steaks are amazing and the service is top notch!",

I was expertly consulted by a sommelier on my wine choices to go with my $50 filet that was cooked to a perfect medium rare. All in all I had a $120 five course meal with two glasses of wine. Some may think outrageous, but hey its Vegas and I didn't have a problem splurging a little bit. Enjoy yourself - this is 5 star perfection for service.",

    "text": "This was my third time at an Emeril restaurant, and once again I left feeling that paying $85 to eat dinner was perfectly justified.  Appetizer: The traditional New Orleans gumbo.  Smokey, spicy, warm, and comforting.    Entree: Filet mignon, medium.  Crusted with just the right amount of spices, cooked to perfection, and crowned with a healthy pat of herb butter.    Side Dish: Country smashed potatoes.  Clearly filled with more butter and cream than I care to think about, skins left in (love that), and just melt-in-your-mouth delicious.    My friend's side dish: Bacon & cheese grits.  I normally don't like grits, but these were nice and well...gritty, not runny or gloppy.  Add bacon and cheese...c'mon.     Dessert: The best part of the meal.  Wait--probably the best part of my entire Vegas trip.  Warm pecan pie with an oatmeal shortbread cookie crust, topped with homemade vanilla ice cream and caramel sauce.  Just...wow.  The pecans were chopped into manageable pieces, the filling was not overly thick and cloying, and I could have eaten the crust by itself and been happy.  I had a taste of my friend's chocolate bread pudding, which was gooey and intensely chocolatey, but not too sweet.  (It tasted like a combo of semi-sweet & bittersweet.)  Drinks: Pretty good.  They don't have a specialty cocktail list since they are very into being a traditional steakhouse, but my pineapple martini was nice.    Decor: Very bare bones- the plain beige walls have no art on them, but that allows you to notice the very ornate architecture of the place, with high ceilings and arches everywhere.  I was too into my food to really care what it looked like though.  Service: As always with Emeril's restaurants- impeccable.  We had no less than 3 people taking care of us at all times: one to take our orders, one to bring our food, and one to take it away.    Tip: SHARE an entree.  I split the 9.5 oz. filet mignon with my friend and I'm glad I did.  The average portion is enough for 2 or 3 people.",

I dont get how some people say this is the best steak they have ever had! They must either not get out much or believe the Outback Steakhouse is a fantastic place to get a steak.   Great waiters and staff that met your needs however the food doesn't compair! Now the unique style of your meal will be a delight in being the flavor of your steak or the style in which the meal is plated! I have eaten in many steakhouses and still yet nothing compares to Mastros, the ultimate steakhouse in the United States! I do give Emeril or the chef who cooked my steak credit in which the steak had an awesome flavor in every bite i took but still the meal is nothing more than average! I would give Delmonico's a 3 1/2 star!",

First, even though we had a reservation, they had us wait for 20 min in the lounge. Fine, we had some drinks. My cosmopolitan was not impressive at all: I had two sips and didn't finish the rest.   Then the food itself. Good news is, everything came very fast. Bad news is, it tasted OK but not great: steak was either too chewy or had too much spice (and we had the famed bone-in ribeye and a chateaubriand (spelling?)), truffled chips were fried very brown.  Tableware was uninspired, especially the tea cups got to me: I think I've seen better ones at a Motel 6 for breakfast.  Last, the service. Overall it was OK, but then, when I was in the middle of a story, the waiter comes to ask how we are doing and goes on for 10 minutes about this and that and how the convention is different this year, etc. Really? By the time he is done, nobody remembers what we were talking about, and I am MAD.  Find a better place to spend your money.",

I have had my share of prime cuts of beef and one thing they are not is tough. Especially a rib-eye. Our steak was not only tough, but flavorless and mealy as well. I really wanted to like this place. My husband and I sat at the bar and had great service from the bartender. We split the rib-eye because who in the heck can eat a whole one of those? It was perfectly cooked. Cutting into it was another matter. It took effort. The consistency was mealy, and without one of the three sauces they offer with it, was completely flavorless. I think Emeril is trying to pawn off a lesser grade of beef on poor unsuspecting tourists, some of who he thinks do not know any better. Shame on him.  To know what a real USDA Prime cut of beef is head down the road to Ruth's Chris Steak House.",

The steak, Bone-in Ribeye, was beautifully cooked, seasoned well, and tasted magnificent. But that isn't why this spot is so memorable! The unique flavors of the rest of the meal is the reason why I would go back. For appetizer I had the BBQ shrimp which was deep, smoky, rich, had a little kick, and was out of this world, definitely something you finish and contemplate ordering another. Lobster bisque was phenomenal, nice big chunks of meat, smooth explosive flavor. The sides were on point too but nothing extraordinary. They also had this crisp local beer form Louisiana called Abita Amber which was awesome. Overall I left only complaining about how stuffed I was.",

We started with the tuna/salmon tar tare - wasn't mediocre but still good  The men ordered the bone-in rib eyes and the ladies ordered the petite rib eye special - that came with a marrow/wine sauce over the steaks in place of butter.  My husband and I both ordered ours medium-rare, the other pair ordered theirs medium.  When we received our steaks, they ended up giving everyone the wrong steaks.  The other couple seemed to have enjoyed our medium-rare steaks though!  We ended our dinner sharing 2 desserts, the banana creme pie and creme brulee - both were yummy.

    "text": "After my first bite into a DelMonico's medium-rare filet, the taste indelibly etched itself into my memory. So much so, in fact, that I dreamt about the steak the following day.   Is the drool obvious?  I could eat this steak every day. I could eat it for breakfast, lunch and dinner. I would bow down to the cow that produced this steak.  As you can see, I'm offering a ringing endorsement for this Emeril-owned establishment. It is, hands down, the best steak I've ever had. They cook the meat to perfection, slightly bloody, just the way I like it, and crusted with a seasoning that offers just enough taste to add flavor to the steak, but not to take away from the meaty perfection.  Besides the steak, the cheese fondue with mini-pretzels is unbelievably creamy and delicious. I could drink it.  DelMonico's isn't cheap, but hell, this is Vegas. You're supposed to indulge, and this is a great place to do it.   I'm really surprised at some of the negative reviews from other Yelpers, but all I can say is, I've been here three times, and the steak is still oh-so-close to my heart (and even closer to my stomach).   Reservations must be made significantly in advance. And don't be surprised when the bill comes-like i said, it's not cheap. But the service is amazing and totally attentive, and the food speaks for itself. It's in the posh Venetian (by far one of my favorite hotels in Sin City), so you want to dress to impress and sip top shelf martinis. Yum. I wish I were there right now. Where's my steak knife, dammit?",

The Caesar salad was delicious but how can you really go wrong with that? The main course was the absolute worst. Three pieces of meat per person, and it was barely lukewarm. I saw our server \"heat\" it up for maybe 3 seconds, and then take it off the grill. Although the meat was flavorful, the fact that it was almost COLD ruined the whole meal. Not only that, I asked our server to take a picture of us since it was my bday, and he handed over my camera to another server as if he was too good to take a damn picture!  At the end, we had a couple cups of coffee, and was given their birthday raspberry sorbet, which wasn't even edible. Overall NOT recommended.",

A $50 bottle of French wine later and the meal we had was filling, hedonistic, awesome, whatever superlative I could give.  The appetizers were great; I had gumbo, and split barbeque shrimp and butternut squash ravioli with duck confit on top.  Portions for apps were not  teeny, which was impressive, because honestly I expected it to be.  Then comes the main course.  All four of us split the chateaubriand, which was tender, carved tableside, and delicious.  The crust of the steak was delicious as well.  Almost as impressive were the side dishes; truffle parmesan potato chips and creamed corn (Yes, who thought Creamed Corn could emerge from the cafeteria lunch as a DELICIOUS side dish).  Yes, it's expensive; it's Vegas.  But I was very impressed with the quality.  Will gladly go back when I have more $.",

    "text": "Being a fan of the Food Network and chef Emeril Lagasse, my girlfriend (fiance the next day!) reserved us a dinner date to this place. I was excited but then again curious on why it was it was so expensive. They must serve some really good cow I thought!  Anyways, the website said the dress code to be business casual/fine dining. We dressed up but saw a few people came in with shorts and a shirt. They seated us towards the side which was kinda of private from the crowd. It was romantic and our waiter was really nice since we asked for it.  We started off with a bottle of Cabernet. I don't remember if we had any appetizers or not. If we did, I didn't remember therefor it wasn't a \"wow\" factor. For the main course, I had the filet minion where as my fiance ordered the famous boned rib-eye. We also ordered some asparagus and gratin potatoes on the side which was excellent. My medium filet was cooked to perfection. When they brought out the rib-eye, we were like, \"whoa!\" It was huge... Once she digged in, she couldn't keep her knife off it. It was so juicy and delicious! I was actually eying her rib-eye the whole time. We actually swapped our dishes half way. She is generous like that. :). After being buzz off the wine, and bloated off the food, we finished it off with the creme brulee. It just hit the spot...  The check came out to be around $250. It was well worth it and I will definitely be coming back here in the future.",

    "text": "I just arrived into Las Vegas tonight for a business trip and I headed straight to Delmonico's.  I have been wanting to try an Emeril Lagasse restaurant and in particular Delmonico's.  I walked in and got seated quickly......it was 5pm and there were only a coulple tables that were taken.  After looking over the menu, I ordered the lobster bisque, creamed corn and a bone in rib eye steak.  After ordering, I was given warm rolls which I quickly ate three of them.....they were fluffy, and super tasty with butter.  The lobster bisque was outstanding.....very creamy and full of lobster flavor.   I thought Craftsteak, Capital Grille and the Palm had the best lobster bisque....Delmonico's is right up there with being one of the best.  The steak came out perfect........juicy, tender and just the right amount of marbling.  The creamed corn was equally as good as the steak and bisque.  It was sweet....not too creamy.....super yummy.  For desert, I had the banana cream pie......a super, super pie filled with banana cream, whipped cream and tons of bananas.  Overall, one of my best steak meals...ever!  The service was excellent and the ambiance/decor was very, very romantic.  A great place for a Valentines or Anniversary dinner!  I will be back.....one of the best on the Strip!",

    "text": "Amazing steak, as well as some of the best service I've ever had at a restaurant.  My friends and I came here for dinner on a Sunday (with a reservation, just in case), and we decided to split two steaks between 3 girls. We ehard that the portions are very generous, and we also wanted to try out the sides as well.  We ordered the bone in ribeye, along with the bone in filet mignon with a mushroom sauce (one of the specials of the day).  We also ordered the truffle parmesan potato chips, as well as the creamed corn gratinee and the country smashed potatoes.  The first thing to come out were the potato chips. Sadly, for a girl who eats potato chips as her main meal frequently, I couldn't partake of them because of the parmesan (I cannot stand stinky cheese).  However, I did at least try ONE, and the texture of the chip (similar to a kettle chip almost), and the slight hint of truffle was amazing. However, the parmesan was still prominent, so I watched sadly while my gfs devoured the chips. I felt as if I was being punished, for some reason.  Luckily our steaks arrived at that point, and they were HUGE. It was definitely a good idea that we had decided to split two instead of each of us ordering our own.  Our server (who's name I forgot), was incredibly helpful and nice. He brought over a carving table and after presenting the steaks to us, took them aside and carved them all for us.  We got our sides at that point too, and we just dug in.  The rib eye was incredibly flavorful. I tend to not normally order it because not all places will grill the ribeye properly and I end up with a slightly tough steak (even if ordered at medium). This one had just the right amount or pink, and the seasoning was mild enough so that the flavor of the meat shone through.    The filet was also very tender.  While we were eating the filet without the mushroom demiglace, I decided to test it out.  The sauce is based on a reduction of veal stock, and it complimented the steak wonderfully. It didn't mask the taste of the meat at all but just added another dimension to it.  After urging my friends to try the sauce, we quickly started pouring spoonfuls of it over the rest of the steak on our plates.  The sides were very good as well. The creamed corn had a hint of spice due to some mined jalapenos that were in it. Definitely a trick I am looking forward to trying at home.  As great as the food was, I was also very impressed with the level of service. You would think that a fancy steak restaurant would be annoyed at the sharing of steaks, but they never batted an eye to our request (apparently a lot of people do this).  In addition, we never felt as if we were waiting to flag down a server whenever we needed assistance.  For everything we got, the meal itself also came out to be a lot less than I expected (although I'm sure it has to do with the sharing as well). However, we were so full and satisfied from our meal that we promptly fell asleep back in our room and decided against going out that night. That is definitely a sign of a great meal.",

The place was well decorated and had a great vibe.  The food was up to par and certain items had great taste, such as the lobster bisque.  I was hoping for more with the wilted spinach salad, but it was still OK.  The complimentary amuse bouche was a nice touch, tasted like a truffle cream of mushroom.  Now the steak, everyone says to go with the bone-in ribeye, so that's what I got.  Tasty, but needed a bit more flavor.  Not as buttery and smooth as other high end steakhouses.  Service could use some attention for a restaurant of this caliber.  Forgot our truffle potato chips and service went downhill with the way they took our plates and such.  Not sure I'd go back with all the other many celebrity chef restaurants to try, but it's definitely one of the better ones.",

    "text": "As a restaurant under Emeril Lagasse's name, I was expecting a consistent, quality meal.  Instead, I left very disapointed with the restaurant.  The only highlight was the signature BBQ shrimp appetizer.  The butternut squash raviolis with duck confit were unexplainably dry.  The shredded duck on top should be slightly dry or crispy, but the inside of the raviolis shouldn't be.  I don't know if I could even say the butternut squash was pasty.  So dry it was bordering on gritty.     The truffle parmesan potato chips were cut ultra thin and so tasty, but were dripping with too much oil.  Instead of tasting light and airy, they felt weighed down by goopy oil drops that clung to each chip.    Then there's the steak.  We ordered one bone in ribeye and a standard ribeye.  Both cuts were juicy, marbled nicely and cooked to the right levels, except for one thing, the steak had no taste.  What creates the taste, seasoning and aging?  Well, whatever it was, it was only surface deep.  the outer portion of the steak was seasoned, but the meat in the middle really had no taste.  Even the butter scoop that topped the steak couldn't make a noticeable difference.      Don't get me wrong, the meat quality was good, but if I pay $50 for a steak, I expect flavor.  It felt like I was eating a $25 steak.   I almost wanted to ask them for bernaise sauce to get me through it.  Even though the wait staff was extremely helpful and attentive, it couldn't save this disappointing meal.     In Vegas the only other steakhouse I've been to is N9ne at the Palms and I would recommend that over Delmonico's in a heartbeat.   I don't think I'll be going back.",

Perfectly cooked and the potatoes on the side were delectable.  I tasted my friend's steak which I had no complaints with. It just wasn't anything special. I'm pretty sure I could have made the same steak for cheaper.   However, since California is banning foie gras, we ordered that with the steak and boy was that fattened duck liver good on top of it.

The ambience is a little sterile and it seems like they forgot to put the art up on the walls.

For my entree, I decided to try the Piedmontese Petit Filet Mignon because of the rave reviews.  When I finally took a bite, it tasted like a steak I could have gotten at Black Angus not one that I just paid $50 for.  It was a pretty thin cut of meat and was a little mealy.  My husband ordered the regular Filet Mignon, which was terribly over seasoned.  Our service was nothing special, but we weren't even told about some of the specials that we saw as we were walking out the door.  All in all, there are so many other wonderful places to eat in Las Vegas, I would have loved to spend the $200 I spent on this meal elsewhere!  Definitely a forgettable and regretful experience.",

The only part I didn't enjoy was the oysters. We mentioned it to two different waiters and only ate about 6 of the 12 oysters. We were all a little upset and we spent $1500 on dinner and they couldn't take the oysters we didn't care for off the bill.  We sure to stop by the bar on the way in or out. Not only is the wine list worth the trip but if you like high-end bourbon this is a great place. They have several different Pappy Van Winkle bourbons and Templeton Rye.",

    "text": "First let me say that this has been my favorite Las Vegas restaurant for several years.  That is what makes this review so difficult for me to write.  My last two trips to Delmonico's have left me looking for a new favorite.  We were there Friday night for our anniversary.  We were seated at a table that was next table a food staging area.  We had servers all around our table all night  prepping food for other diners.  It was very irritating.  The food was ok but not great.  The service was terrible.  We asked for horseradish sauce when our steaks arrived and actually got it when we were just about to finish our meals.  We actually had to look for someone to refill our drinks on several occasions.  I love this place but I will not be back.  Our bill was over $400 for 4 people and I am ok with that but we got $75 Longhorn's type service and I cannot live with that.  Sorry Delmonico's.  I am out.  Need a new favorite Vegas restaurant.  Suggestions?",

A few favorites:  Arrive early and visit Max the Bartender.  Just recently learned he is a world class mixologist (after ordering wine for years) and will create beverages that will make your head spin.  Has his own bitters collection to add a custom touch.  Tequila Gumption he made me was world class.  I always get the Filet Pittsburgh Style and it is exceptional.  Not too loaded down with butter and just the right flavor.  If I am steaked out, The Salmon dish is incredible.  Creamed Corn is to die for with jalapeno seasoning topping (I am hyper critical of creamed corn but thing D's and STK are two of the best).  Biscuits that they serve are out of this world.  Potato chips with truffle oil are a nice indulgence.  Caprese salad is a great starter.  Like the wine list and not over priced like Del Frisco and the Wynn or Bellagio spots.  Finish it off with a double espresso and you are ready to venture on into the evening.  I prefer to sit in the main room and the seating towards the back is preferred.  Lamont is the best server by far.",

    "text": "I'd probably give Delmonico four stars, except that my expectations were set higher than they probably should have been. In all honesty, The Delmonico did not deliver anything notably better, more worthy of celebrity, than the average high end steak house in Nashville - including Stoney River, Ruth's, or local favorites like Sperry's. I guess I thought that for all the critique Emeril gives Top Chef stars, his restaurant would blow me away.  The homemade truffle chips were good, and somewhat unique, but perhaps a little over cooked, leaving a numb of chips hard.  Our steaks were indeed prepared excellently, and a quality cut of meat. I had the filet, which was an ample serving and cooked to a perfect medium rare.  But the twice baked potatoes were a big disappointment. The shells seems to be way overcooked, to the point or requiring a steak knife to cut through them. The flavor was bland, even with cheddar and bacon. A little salt and pepper certainly helped.  We did enjoy the creamed spinach, even including my colleague who usually doesn't like green things.  The bread pudding was definitely the way to go on dessert. We also had a slice of banana cream pie, but the star was the bread pudding, which was not ruined with raisins. It was rich, smooth, creamy and delicious.",

Lobster Bisque....probably the best I have ever had.  Consider this the m80 of the meal exploding with flavor and a generous mound of Lobster.  The crab was good but nothing to oooh and aaaah over.  The steak was good too but I wasn't jumping up and down with excitement.  As for the side dishes...the gratin potatoes and the mushrooms were by far the best.  Our table tried almost all of them and those two would be the ones I would dive into.  The other guests felt everything was a little over seasoned.  I didn't get that but I am also borderline billy goat with my love of the salt.  What gives this place 4 stars is the service.  The staff was awesome.  Light the fuse of your tastebuds at this tasty steakhouse if you are craving an old school steak dinner with amazing service.",

While our Bordeaux decanted, the artisinal cheese plate was a perfect appetizer, as was the grilled shrimp with black truffle special.    Lobster bisque was grand.  The gumbo 100% authentic.  Her crab stuffed lobster tail was heavenly.  My bone-in ribeye was simply perfect.. We loved the creamed corn gratin.  And then it was time for dessert.  This dinner was my 4th time at an Emeril Lagasse property since my first visit to his flagship restaurant in New Orleans almost 20 years ago.  For all that time I've been telling her about Emeril's bananna cream pie, while I made it for her from one of his cookbooks.  But now she's had the real thing and agrees it really is the best she's ever tasted. Her comment to our kids said it all: \"at least Dad tried.\"  With a very special wine, $800 for two.

    "text": "First, I want to say that it was totally cool to be able to make a reservation here via Open Table though Yelp. It was easy and I didn't have to sign up for any additional stuff. Big ups right there. I even received a confirmation email the night before (although I had already called to confirm the reservation).  Our server name? Michael Jackson. He didn't moonwalk for us but it was probably the best single display of customer service in a restaurant that I've ever had the pleasure of dining in. He was engaging, attentive, and even dropping \"kama'aina\" and a few other Pidgin words upon realizing all of us were sitting there in our Sig Zane's (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/sig-zane-designs-hilo\">yelp.com/biz/sig-zane-de...</a>).  We actually started with a small sampler platter that was given to us on the house because we were with our friends who lived there. I guess they like to encourage Las Vegas locals to come down more often. It was juicy because of the veggies on top, but the meat was a bit crisp and even more on the burnt side for me. After that we ordered the Truffle Oil and Parmesan Potato Chips and Emeril's signature cajun New Orleans Barbecue Shrimp appetizers. The potato chips were highly addictive and had a super rich flavor to them. Add the Parmesan and the saltiness was of great compliment. One of the many highlights to the evening was the shrimp appetizer. The large shrimp were wonderfully crafted with just the right amount of spices to encourage their fresh sweetness to linger.  I ordered the special Bone in Rib Eye Steak. It was perfectly cooked to medium. The thing was pretty large and I finished off most of it, but coupled with everything else we ordered, it was a tall task. My good friend ordered the Filet Mignon Medallions and they were spectacularly juicy and flavorful. I actually secretly wished I had ordered that instead.  Ours sides consisted of Potato Gratin, caramelized Seasonal Onions, and Creamed Corn Gratinee. They all were excellent in their own right. My friend described the Potato Gratin as the single best dish of Potato Gratin he has ever had. Myself, I thought that the Seasonal Onions were spectacularly sweet. They blew my mind and I almost loaded up on those alone. The Corn Gratinee was also sweet, but it wasn't as good as the other two. Although, two spectacular sides out of three isn't too shabby.  Overall, it was a great spending time with good friends over an excellent meal in addition to the wonderful service. It was worth every expensive penny I could slam on the credit card. I would easily recommend to anyone the experience. Reservations are highly recommended. One last note, we even got a hand-written thank you postcard less than a week later from Michael. That was really nice.",

My party of 4 arrived early, but no problem- they had our table ready for us!  We ordered a bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon ($65) and had the following:  I ordered two appetizers for my entree: 1. Vine-Ripened Heirloom Tomato Salad with Burrata Cheese, Red Onion, Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Balsamic Vinegar and Torn Local Basil. - I was a little sad that the Burrata cheese was so small compared to the heirloom tomatoes, but it was delicious!  2. Butternut Squash Ravioli with Sage Brown Butter, Toasted Hazelnuts and Parmesan - OMG!  SO GOOD!  The squash was divine.  I would definitely order this again.  3. Grilled Marinated Organic Chicken Breast - Roasted Fingerling Potatoes, Whole Garlic, Wild Mushrooms and Natural Reduction - The person that ate this said that the chicken was cooked perfectly and had really good flavor.  4. Filet Mignon w/ a twice baked potato (with Bacon and Vermont Cheddar) and a Caesar Salad. - He said that the steak melted in his mouth!  5. Surf & Turf- bone in ribeye and crab & buttered Fresh Asparagus, I believe. (I don't see it on the menu, so it must be a special) - My husband cleaned his plate.  We also ordered two desserts: 1. Delmonico Chocolate Layer Cake - Chocolate Pudding, Coconut Ice Cream and Toasted Almonds - Looked delicious.  They said it was good and the coconut ice cream was amazing!  2. Pecan Pie with Oatmeal Shortbread Crust French, Vanilla Ice Cream & Caramel Sauce - Pie was in the shape of a circle, so the center was ooey and gooey and yummy!!  Very good!  Price was about $300+ for the table (not including tip).  The service was OUTSTANDING!  We actually had 3 people waiting on us and never had to ask for anything.  They were on-point with re-filling the water at the table!  It was SO nice to never have to look around for someone to help us.  The timing of everything was beautiful.  We even got an amuse-bouche bruschetta when we were deciding what to have for dinner.  What a nice surprise!!",

Because they like to present everyone's meal at exactly the same time it took just about every server they had to serve each of our courses. I always had a full drink waiting for me. and whenever someone would leave the table a waiter would come by with a new napkin for them. The chef comes out and not only helps serve but also explains exactly what we're eating. tonight we started of with my favorite parmesan truffle chips. then came caviar on deviled eggs. next was pan seared duck breast with chanterelle mushrooms. For the meat course we had filet topped with red potatoes and foie gras. to end the meal we got an assortment of all their deserts. Everything was so good. My favorite was, of course the duck. My favorite desert was the creme brulee and churros. They make the absolute best churros I've ever eaten. They are hot, super light and come with dipping sauces. Can't wait for the next visit.",

    "text": "I had never been to Delmonico's before, but came here with friends who wanted to eat here. Definitely glad I did! First off, they are located between Palazzo and The Venetian, and caught our attention as we passed it daily during our conference at the Sands Expo.  We had reservations, and they sat us immediately, zero wait time. From the 'street' view you can see the bar and lounge seating area, while dining is further back. The space is beautiful, mildly reminiscent of a wine cellar with the arches and ceiling. The only possible thing I can complain about is that the bathroom is down a long stretch of hallway, but that was only mildly annoying.  The menu offerings were plentiful, definitely offering something for everyone in our small group. I opted for the Filet Mignon, Parmesan Truffle Chips, Creamed Corn Gratinee, and finished with Banana Cream Pie. As an appetizer, the chips were surprising: a snappy twist on familiar, comfortable potato chips, light and crispy with a bite of Parmesan; described as addictive, and I would have to agree! My steak was cooked to perfection; perfect texture and temperature, being tender, juicy, and well-seasoned. If I recall, they used the Emeril (essence or all-spice) on the outside with a char-broiling, and it added some great flavor. Along with my main entree was the creamed corn gratinee. This was not bad; a creamed corn, warm, comforting, with a layer of crispy breading/bread crumbs on top. While it was sweet, warm, and filling, it did not seem to stand out as anything special or remarkable compared to the other dishes. The Banana Cream Pie was, well, gigantic, but delicious. A great, balanced ratio of banana to cream to crust, with whipped cream and a caramel drizzle. Flavor was smooth, just sweet enough without being overbearing, and had a richness that was filling; a great way to end the meal.  Overall service was exquisite. From the moment we entered, we felt welcomed and catered to. Our service team introduced themselves immediately and made sure anything we needed was taken care of. I never saw the bottom of my water glass, which has always been a testament to attentive service in my mind. There was an order mistake where a friend's steak was switched out, but they were quick to notify us and apologize, and gave us the options to either wait to bring out all the food together or serve as the food came out (we opted for the latter).  While pricey, this was honestly fairly priced for fine dining on the strip. Overall great dining experience, from atmosphere, to service, to taste! Highly recommend if you're in the area!",

Ladies, wear your fat dress for this meal.. you'll thank me later.  + bone-in ribeye medium rare (9/10): amazing steak! Perfectly cooked and they were generous enough to split it in half for us when we said we were sharing. One of my friends pieces had a bit too much fat though.. + bone marrow 8/10: yum yum yum + creamed spinach, potatoes au gratin, creamed corn 8/10: deeeelicious sides. Recommend all, esp the potatoes!   ~ table-side Caesar 6.5/10: maybe it's the fact that they make it at your table so it's more fun, but this was simple and delicious. Def a pretty pricey salad ~ scallops 5/10: prob my least favorite starter. Was tasty, but nothing special compared to other scallops I've had. And, it was $20 for 2 tiny scallops!",

    "text": "TL;DR: Decent steakhouse that matches its price tag; what you might expect in 5 star Vegas hotels. Not a bad option if you have $60 to drop on steak.   While this steakhouse might not be anything noteworthy apart from the celebrity status of its owner, Emeril Lagasse, it serves solid food for an albeit expensive price. To be fair, though, we need to recognize that it is located in a 5-star hotel on the Las Vegas strip, one of the most tourist-saturated areas on Earth, where you can expect to be overcharged for everything. That being said, this steakhouse does what every steakhouse should to a fair standard.  The service here is as good as you would expect at a fancy steakhouse. The free bread here is unusual, though; it seems to be a hollow roll formed by a shell of Pillsbury croissant dough, which isn't bad, but isn't especially good either. USDA Prime steaks go for around $50-$60, and are enough to feed 2 people, or one really hungry person. I ordered the steaks medium-rare, and they were cooked to order, maybe a hair closer to a medium. The steaks had a good charred crust, a mark of a good steak and something difficult to achieve at home. They offer two complimentary steak sauces, both of which pair well with the steak. I'm personally a fan of ribeye steaks and recommend that cut above anything else at a steakhouse like this one. Sides are typical, and the asparagus was nothing special but good as it was.   While Emeril may never have set foot in this steakhouse, it certainly does not disappoint. While it may not be as great as some of the most famous steakhouse in NYC, Delmonico does a good job at serving beef in the middle of a touristy destination. While it probably isn't worth more than the effort of a short walk to get to, if you're staying at the Palazzo or Venetian and are looking for a fancy steak dinner, this restaurant is a solid option.",

The food was delicious which was not the issue. It was the service. Typically there is a feeling of special treatment and a high level of service. The staff normally are gracious and attentive. Everything is orchestrated so beautifully. This time, we had to ask three people for our drink order ( a Diet Pepsi) and the staff came off as indifferent and abrupt. Even the lead appeared rushed and rarely checked on us.  I hope that this is a one time experience. For the amount of money we spend, we do expect more. Perhaps a refresher on service delivery and creating the experience.",

Evey famous chef in town thinks he can just open a steakhouse, slap his name on it and cook a bone in ribeye. The food was ok at best. The table side Caesar was terrible, Costco does a better bag salad. The bone-in ribeye was ok. I would have liked the bone frenched and the cut twice as thick. It was cooked properly but covered with so much butter that was all I could taste. Our sides, creamed spinach and mashed potatoes, were good. Cocktails, wine and expresso were also good. The worst thing about this place, is the sterile atmosphere. It had no personality, we could have been anywhere. We wont be going back.",

Bland white walls, no fancy decor or priceless works of art here folks.  The steak was okay. Potatoes on the side were so overdone it was as hard as cardboard.  The octopus appetizer was carelessly prepared. Just deep fried octopus which makes it faster and easier to bring to the table rather than grilling it like Greek or Spanish style which takes time.  The Banana cream pie was great so I highly recommend it :)  Service is FANTASTIC :)",

    "text": "My buddy booked this place for my bachelor party dinner. We had a group of 10 but the restaurant can only seat parties of 9 at most together at one table.  Since we had 10, they had to put us on two separate tables, which was ok, because they were right next to each other anyway.  Decor:  nothing spectacular.  i thought it was alittle too dim for me.  I like a well lit restaurant for the purpose of really getting to see the different colors of your food and wine.  You can tell a lot about your food by it's color...it's freshness, it's doneness, etc.  Food:  Very good.  I had the filet and it was super tender.  My buddies ordered the bone in rib-eye and almost all said it was amongst the best steaks they ever had.  Everything is a la carte so we shared sides of grilled asparagus (good), garlic smashed potatoes (yummy), sauteed wild mushrooms (yummy), and caesar salad (good).  Service:  Very good also.  Our waiter was very polite even when our rowdy half drunk group couldn't decide on what to order.  He was very helpful with the wine and picked out a nice bottle of merlot that worked with our budget.  Server's were very fast and attentive.  They made sure everything was perfect...which pretty much was.  Price:  Pretty fair and expected of a high end steak house.  bone in 20 oz. rib-eye was about $50 and my 12 oz. filet was around $45.  Sides were around $8-12, and one order feeds 2 people.  Yes, they have an extensive wine list and Yes, they have seafood also.  One last important note:  there isn't a smoking/non-smoking section, so people with kids, and non-smokers beware.",

I would rate it in better than a ruth chris, ditka's, chop house and in the same category as a shula's or capitol grill.  The service is 5* as they have 3+ waiters taking care of you constantly, but not overbearing. Type of place where you leave to use the washroom and you  come back to the table and with a folded napkin and a refilled water glass.  Love the appetizers, my wife believes it they have the best lobster bisque soup out there.  The steak's are great sizes and range from $42-$50, but you're truly getting what you pay for. For the dolts who dinged this place because of the cost, if you want a piece of grizzle for $20 then go to outback.  Whenever my wife and I come to vegas and we need to celebrate something, this is the restaurant we do it at.",

The style and ambiance is very simple and chic. If I may add another word - classy. The service was impeccable! The waiters (we had 3), were so welcoming and genuinely interested in how they could make our stay there memorable. So that's always a big plus for me (i do not like snooty waiters).  The food was great! Not the best I've tasted but still up there =). I had the white fish with lump crab and it was delicious! The fish was soft and not chewy at all and the crab definitely complimented the slight saltiness of the fish. Great find! The New orleans bbq shrimp were a tad too salty for my taste, but nevertheless, delicious. I would've definitely ordered dessert, but I was so full that I just couldn't get myself to do it.  In any case, I had a wonderful time and I must implore you to try it if you are ever at the Venetian Hotel in Las Vegas (did that sound classy??? eh i tried). Lol. Bottom line: go for it!",

I may be partial to the spice \"rub\"/\"crust\" they put on it which is not traditional for high end steak places which favor only salting their meat, but honestly I wish other places seasoned their meats a little more. It was truly delicious. My brother ordered the NY and my aunt ordered the Filet and they were both in agreement I had the best tasting steak.  The service was exactly what you would expect and demand from a place in this price range and all the sides and appetizers were definitely good (but not great).  Their wine list is literally an encyclopedia of wine so it was a little intimidating and I opted for a glass of Scotch instead.   In comparison to some of the newer & flashier spots like SW & CUT the ambiance is a little muted but its still classy. Like I stated, go here and order the regular Rib Eye.. I highly doubt you will be disappointed.",

We started the evening with a pre drink at the bar which is a small but nice and up scale place. Then we both ordered starter and main course. I had the oyster platter and my friend and the shrimp bbq. The oyster were great, especially because it is the small size ones, more flavorful to me. I think the big hit was the shrimp which takes about 12 hours to make that special bbq sauce. Then we were recommended to try to the bone in ribeye as far as steak. We were going there for steaks to start with but this was definitely a hit. Steak was perfectly cooked, dry aged (8 weeks i think) and we had a lovely potato gratin to complement that. I wasn't a big fan of the corn side dish we ordered though. The waiter also suggested a nice red wine to complement that. Service was top notch with 3-4 servers always around you which is very appreciable. If you are in a mood for steak, i think this is one of the best option in Vegas for sure.",

I ordered the signature rib-eye with a side of wild mushrooms.  The wife ordered the braised beef ribs.  Atmosphere: The wait-staff was nice and the person takimg our order didn't seem to mind that I asked if they had beer (they do) as opposed to ordering a glass of wine.  Lights weren't bright, a bit dim for my liking, but the area was very spacious.  Food:  The steak was cooked perfectly medium-rare, not under, not over, just right.  Nothing fancy for the seasoning, just good old salt and pepper.  A nice seared crust on the outside, nice and tender on the inside.  However, I wouldn't call it the best steak I've ever had, but it was very good.  The wild mushrooms were excellent, I would order those again for sure.  The braised beef ribs were okay, not great.  A bit too salty, but I guess that's why it was on the Specials menu.  Price:  Well, it's Vegas and it's a nicer restaurant, be prepared to pay.  Frankly, I've paid more for steak, and this wasn't he most expensive steakhouse I've been to.  However, when my wife and I saw the bill, we both said \"oh, that's not that bad.\"  Overall it was a good experience eating there.  If you enjoy steak, you will like this steakhouse.  I'm sure those that enjoy wine with their meals would enjoy this place a bit more than I did though.",

    "text": "Ditto on the disappointment.  I would have given D's maybe one more star, but since I paid $120  (well, factoring ~$10 to help pay for our guest of honor).for my dinner, that just really knocked down the rating.  D's ain't worth it.  I was there with a bachelor party, twelve dudes, and the average price was $120+ for each person.  My food: bone in rib eye, medium rare, shared a side of creamed spinach, and no drink.  Yes, all this for $120.  Rib eye: cooked perfectly, huge slab of meat.  I expected a nice marble, maybe a little excess fat, but by the time I was done, maybe a quarter of the original steak was off to the side...all fat and gristle.  I'm also spoiled and used to the 300 degree plate that you get at good ol' Mastro's, and since D's steak is served on a regular plate, the huge steak seemed to get cold pretty damn fast.  Creamed spinach:  I could have gotten something better out of a can.  Got stone cold real fast too.  All this for $120.    Service: Very good and very attentive.  Guess this is where my $120 went.  ...  $120   :(",

    "text": "Hey everyone - first yelp review. And what better way to kick it off than with the wonderful Delmonico Steakhouse in the Venetian Hotel and Casino. This is my first Emeril's experience and it was a good one.   Disclaimer: A fraternity brother of mine is a manager here and insisted that my group try it!   I was in town for a bachelor party and 8 of us dined here on a Friday night. We had a reservation for 8:30 and were seated promptly. The appetizers included delicious (albeit greasy) chips sprinkled with parmesan cheese and the New Orleans BBQ Shrimp with biscuit. The shrimp were easily the most tasty that I've ever had - my only complaint is that one order ($18 only included 3 shrimp). I wish I had 2 or even three. The biscuit was pointless for this entree (and barely noticeable), It actually went uneaten as our party was preoccupied with the wonderful hot butter rolls that they continued to bring around.  For my entree I had the filet mignon ($48) and it was absolutely fabulous. I order my steaks medium well to well, which could sometimes mean a loss of flavor if it's not done right. In this case, the steak was cooked perfectly and had a ton of flavor. This was easily the best steak I've ever had - and I'm a red meat fan.   Service was excellent, atmosphere was a bit gloomy (although aren't good steak houses supposed to be?) and I was simply too full to try dessert. The rest of the party thoroughly enjoyed their meal. The highlight of the evening may have been seeing Larry Flynt seated just a few feet away from us, enjoying his steak and eggs. Apparently he's a regular.  If you're in Vegas and looking for a sure-fire steakhouse, stop by Emeril's Delmonico. You WON'T be disappointed.",

Delmonico's is easily in the bottom third of dining options on the Strip, and maybe even that is too generous. There are at least 5 better options in The Venetian alone.   I've had better rib eye steaks for $0.99. Their wine list sucks, too. I expect an upcharge but if I'm going to pay through the nose, at least give me something that wasn't fermented in a toilet.  Skip Delmonico's. Don't spend your winnings at a crappy, over hyped restaurant. And if you're down, why add insult to injury?",

Nonetheless, the steak I had at Delmonico was excellent and the service refreshing by Vegas standards.  The table-side Caesar salad preparation makes for good show and equally excellent taste.  It's not the quietest or the most interesting interior design, very basic and elegant if perhaps a bit crowded.  If you want a nicely cooked piece of quality meat only slightly on the spendy side this is a recommended option.",

My fears were quickly assuaged as our food started arriving. We ordered the lobster sliders as an appetizer to share between two of us, and our other colleague had the lobster bisque. The lobster sliders? Well they are the things dreams are made of, I'm still salivating over them weeks later. Lobster bisque was also apparently outstanding. Fries with old bay, perfectly cooked and tasty. For our entrees, two of us each had the grilled skirt steak sandwich and the other had the steak salad. The steak sandwich and truffle fries were absolutely delicious and I hear the salad was really fantastic. Service was impeccable and obviously we had the restaurant to ourselves, so our every need was catered to perfectly. I definitely will be back.",

    "text": "I kinda view the steakhouse experience from several angles. Not just the price, but also the entrees and sides, the pairing with wine, the atmosphere waiting in line.  I personally liked the atmosphere, as it was nice to have dim lighting for a late 9pm dinner. The waiting bar was nice, although the seats are very very low. A nice confidence booster for short folks, but some might find it uncomfortable.   Inside the restaurant, seats are very comfortable. Unlike my counterparts Don and Elmer, I ordered the standard NY bone-in steak. Very good, my only complaint was that it wasn't boneless! The wine was great; the waiter was helpful in selecting a bottle, very tasty but not too pricey for 4 near-thirtysomethings. The side dish of warm spinach salad(which yours truly ordered) was the showstealer of the night. Everyone liked it, so keep it on your radar if you go.   Overall, I thought it was great. I gave it 4 stars, though it would really be 3 and a half stars. If you want a better selection of steaks, probably go to Ruth Chris, NERO or the Bradley Ogden restaurants. In Vegas, the benchmark is BOA, but BOA can get very very pricey. But for the value and overall celebrity restaurant experience, a good experience. Definitely make reservations thru the casino or through opentable. I would go again with a small group or for an intimate dinner with my girlfriend.",

Our original plan was to grab one drink at the bar and then head elsewhere, but after a couple of drinks and enjoying some superb Parmesan-dusted potato chips, we decided to saunter into the dining room. The dining room reminds me of...a white-walled cave? The house from Xanadu? There's a really nice stone wall on one side, but it's far removed from the dining area. It's formal but informal if that makes any sense.  Anyway, you come here for the food and Delmonico didn't disappoint. My bone-in rib eye was by far one of the best steaks I've had - cooked perfectly, a beautiful color inside and out, and a pat of butter that made the steak even better. We selected the potato croquettes for our side and oh man, were they CHEESY and incredibly well-prepared. We ended with the pecan pie and it was a perfect way to end the night. Regarding service, it was impeccable with three different servers who were all fantastic. The next time I'm in Vegas this will be at the top of my \"repeat restaurant\" list.",

If there's a next time, I would say Med-rare for sure. The NY Streak was Charred. My brother didn't want to send it back though, you know what happens when it goes back.

    "text": "My family loves to go to Vegas for Thanksgiving and have a steak dinner. Who wants to stay home and cook dry ass turkey when you can gamble, drink, and eat amazing steak? Not me! This year we dined at Delmonico.   Our waiter, I really want to say his name was Frank?? but I don't recall for sure. If it was Frank, he was amazing (props to Frank or whoever you were!!!). Anyway, we were a party of 12 and none of us ever waited or wanted for anything. The entire staff was top notch and took care of us so well.   They were offering a traditional Thanksgiving dinner, which seven people in our party ordered. I did not try it. My brother said it was really good, but others said it was whatever. Why you gonna order that at a steakhouse anyway? Beats me!  The five smart people in my party ordered steak and all the appetizers and sides to go with it. We chose correctly!   First off, our waiter, maybe Frank, helped us select a wine and the one he suggested was amazing. We ended up going through two bottles of the 2015 Cab from Jayson in Napa. I will be looking for that wine and buying it for my collection soon!   So what did we have? We started with the Apple Cured Kurobuta Bone-In Bacon and the Blue Cheese Stuffed La Quercia Prosciutto Wrapped Dates. Both were superb! The \"Bacon\" was out of this world! My friend also ordered the Heirloom Tomato Soup, and it was great.  For dinner my father, husband, and I all got the Ribeye, my friend had the Filet, and my niece had the Chicken Breast. The Ribeye was amazing, as was the filet, I did not try the chicken, but she liked it. All the steaks were cooked perfectly and seasoned so well.   For sides we had Duck Fat Fingerling Potatoes, Potato Gratin, Creamed Spinach, and Charred Brussels Sprouts with apple bacon. All were fantastic! Especially the gratin and brussels, even though they looked burnt as hell, they were delicious!  Of course no steakhouse meal is complete with dessert, so five of us split the Bananas Foster. We seriously licked that plate clean, it was amazing!  I would not hesitate to dine here again when in Vegas!",

Most at our table ordered either the rib-eye or the bone-in rib-eye. They were both huge, especially the latter. I'm pretty sure it's enough to share if you've got an average appetite. Mine was cooked to a turn, so there's something to be said about eating at a fine restaurant. It was well-seasoned and very flavorful. The slight char made it especially delightful.    We had some appetizers and sides to share:  Charred octopus:  I liked it because of the char. Octopus doesn't really have much flavor on its own, but the char enhanced it. Someone at our table said that it was like eating a rubber band. Uh, that's kind of what it's supposed to be like!  Truffle/Parmesan chips:  It's like home-made potato chips dried with the truffle oil and had sprinkle chips. Kind of pricey. Plus, I'm not a huge fan of truffle oil.   Potato croquettes:  Kind of like everything you find in a baked potato, except it was formed into croquettes. I liked the bacon, cheese and chives in them. They were pretty good.  Asparagus:  Nothing too fancy. Crisp asparagus with some butter. It was like $15 for not too many.  Creamed spinach:  Really rich. Nicely seasoned.  All in all, the food was excellent. At around $60 per steak and $20-$30 for sides, the extra pounds you would gain *may* just be balanced out by the much lighter wallet.",

The octopus was coooked to a perfect texture balance of crunchy and chewy. It also has wonderful flavor complemented with olives and small potatoes.  Their specialty, the bone-in ribeye, is marinated well and cooked perfectly. The meat was very tender, juicy, and is topped with warm butter.   Sides are served family-style. The Country Smashed Potatoes was the most minimalist item on the menu but has a good taste of fresh mashed potatoes. The charred Brussels Sprouts had a wonderful texture and is well complemented in flavor with bacon.  For dessert, I had the pecan pie. Warm, comes a la mode, and recommended. Normally I don't order dessert but in this case, all the other dishes were so wonderful I couldn't pass a perfect serving record!

Their steak is decent, not the best but decent for a high end restaurant. Service this past weekend was probably the worst I've experienced. The waiter dripped sauce all over my dad while taking a plate off the table and didn't even apologize, he just looked at the mess he made and hurried off..... wow.... not the type of service I'm looking to get while spending $700 on dinner. I'll start going to other places for dinner from now on",

    "text": "Been dining here since 2000, shortly after the Venetian opened.  It's an Old School traditional New York style restaurant, a place where you slip the Maitre D' a bill as he directs you to your table.   (Emeril's Delmonico (Vegas) has nothing to do with the original Delmonico's in NYC, but both are traditional similar spirit steak houses.)  This latest visit two of us shared their Seafood Tower (red king crab legs, poached shrimp, lobster tails, oysters on the half shell and tuna tartare with assorted sauces) and the 20 oz bone in Ribeye with a side of creamed spinach.   Really, too much food for two and I ended up eating 2/3 of it with four pieces of their savory Yorkshire pudding-esque hot bread rolls, but everything was excellent.  All the seafood fresh - and then of course the ribeye (20oz Creekstone Farms naturally raised, dry-aged on premises) - probably the best steak in town. (I recall this steak used to be a combination of dry and wet aged but it's now dry aged only.). Had it medium rare, which portions of it looked startlingly on the red side but it wasn't undercooked and was delicious.   The creamed spinach was traditionally prepared and great.  Added some pepper for additional flavor.   Service was fast efficient and friendly. We were seated at a table for four which is the usual way they do it even if you are a party of one - no half sized tables here.   For a calorie rich special occasion, Delmonico is the way to go.",

The service was good and the menu had expected choices for a steakhouse. Our group was satisfied with their food but I was hoping for a better food experience.  The Caesar salad for 2 was very basic and hardly had any dressing. I had high expectations that weren't meet. I love salmon at steakhouses because you get a nice sear and moist inside. Here the salmon was just good with no sear and the vegetables around it were cold.  The group order some sides and they met the expectations. The mashed potatoes were outstanding, as were the mushrooms, and creamed spinach.  I think Delmonico's is not keeping up with the higher Vegas competition.",

    "text": "I spent the first few days of the week in Vegas and ordering steak at a steakhouse was apart of my daily ritual. I came and ordered the 16oz ribeye steak. It was the perfect cut, juicy and buttery. I had it cooked medium rare. Like all steaks, it was a hefty guy but I only ate one meal a day here.  In addition to the butter, you can also request other sauces to go with your steak - bernaise, au poivre, and worcester sauce are offered in the menu. I asked for the au poivre, but I believe I got a brandy sauce instead. Nonetheless, it was an excellent way to add to the juicy buttery flavors of the steak.   The place also gave each patron a single garlic popover, the most delicious light bread you can have at a steakhouse. It's an excellent starter.  And in each meal, I always need some veggies. The garlic sauteed mushrooms were the perfect complements to the steak.",

Then for dessert I tried something that has been on my bucket list \"to try\" for years....banana foster dessert!    I've heard about this dessert years ago when we took a trip to New Orleans.   It's very hard to find restaurants that serve this dessert, as they make it table side - thus me listing it as a bucket list item.  :)  I'm happy to report that Banana Foster is unbelievably amazing!!!!    The waiter brings a rolling table over that contains a hot plate.  He places a Pan on the hot plate and Melts some butter....then he tosses in some brown sugar with maybe some honey as well???....gets that all carmelized,  and then he adds bananas (flipping them over and over in that fabulous sauce).   Really the ingredients are quite simple.  Then he pours something into the dish (not sure what??) and catches the dessert on fire for just a moment (maybe burning off alcohol?).   Once that is done he takes this wonderful dessert and pours it over vanilla Ice cream.    The combination of warm gooey carmelized  bananas on top cold ice cream is the perfect combo!!!    Don't hesitate, get this dessert!  The service is impeccable here!!!    Thoroughly enjoyed having dinner here while at the Venetian.",

BBQ Shrimp appetizer, one of their signature dishes, was excellent.  Slightly spicy in a nice Creole type sauce.  We also had the Lobster Bisque, which was great (best dish of the night) - good depth of flavor and lots of delicious lobster.  For dinner, my wife had the 6oz filet and I had the Lamb Chops.  The steak was good, as you would expect.  The Lamb Chops not so great -- I get Lamb Chops often and these were pretty fatty overall.  For sides we had the Smashed Potatoes - excellent and with the Bisque worth coming back for.  Broccoli side was average.  Finished with a Banana Cream Pie, which was A++.  Service was great, ambiance slightly lame.  Overall a solid 4 star experience.",

We have heard nothing but wonderful things about the banana cream pie( raving review from (Wolfgang Puck). So we did it ! We ordered the pie and a French press coffee! Already a great start . We sat at the bar (Albert) was the bartender and could not have been any better . So happy to help with our dessert quest and very friendly! Everything came quickly and was soooooo yummy ! This is not your typical banana cream pie, this was more of a custard and not that fake yellow pudding mush ! It is stacked high of whole sliced bananas and what we thought was a cinnamon Graham cracker crust ! Topped mile high with fresh whipped cream and chocolate shavings !!! One word to describe our experience, MMMMMMMMMMMMMM!!!!!",

Unfortunately,  i left unsatisfied with a feeling of disappointment and overall thought it was lackluster. I'd choose Capital Grille, Mastros, or  Lawrys over this place.   To start the popovers they served at the start of the meal were just room temperature. Sometimes you just want a warm piece of bread to start the meal. Well the trend, of luke warm food, continued throughout the service.   The steak medallions were warm and the onion rings tasted day old and warmed over also. Usually you can taste a freshly cooked onion ring but this was just old and sad. For a Creole restaurant the steak medallions lacked seasoning. There was no \"BAM\", spice, hit of heat, or flavor.  I actually had to put salt on them. Ive never had such bland luke warm steak before. Even Maggianos at Fashion Show Mall has better filet medallions  This dish was garnished with apple wood smoked bacon bits that did NOTHING for the dish.  I was so unimpressed with the whole dish. I should have stuck with the burger or the chicken sandwich.  There wasnt much in the way of appetizers we wanted, because they were overpriced or just lacked general appeal. We opted for the potato croquettes for a starter. They came out less like croquettes and more like mounds of tater tots topped with sour cream, bacon and cheese. They were great but a bit over priced as well.    The only thing we enjoyed was the banana cream pie.   Would I return or bring friends and family here? No! The atmosphere was unimpressive and the food was even more so.  For the price and hassle of getting here Id choose other steakhouses mentioned earlier.",

Pricey?  Yes very.  Which is the only reason that might keep me from frequenting this restaurant as much as I would like to.  I don't think they have a dress code.

My husband and I came here 7 years ago after eloping (yeah, my family seems to like eloping in Vegas :)) and we've flown here several times since for the sole purpose of a great meal.  If you're in Vegas, I recommend this restaurant above all others.  But be prepared to spend $100-$150/pp.  I haven't been here in over a year but am going tonight.  I wanted to post this review in advance for the past five times I've been here just in case it's not as great.  Either way, I'll post another review after our most recent dinner tonight.",

    "text": "Incredible service! Made a reservation even though it was after 4th of July weekend. I was glad we had one, it was still packed on a monday night! There were eight of us, my friend's daughter brought her new Build A Bear puppy, and the server brought a setting and high chair for the puppy! How cute is that?? we ordered a bunch of appetizers, the fried calamari was light and crisp, bbq shrimp's sauce was thick and sweet but yet savory, shrimp cocktail should be named prawn cocktail, and the squash ravioli - again, it's the sauce that did it, yum. Every time I see lobster bisque, I order it for the kids, they LOVE it - creamy, velvety with chunks of lobsters. Hubby had the ribeye steak, I had the filet mignon, took a bite of my friends' beef medallion and colorado rack of lamb. I think the ribeye steak and lamb came out the winner. Very juicy and tender, with a little bit burnt on the fat, perfection! We shared the banana cream pie, banana pudding, creme brulee for desserts. The pudding was no doubt the winner, the others are good, but if you can only order one, have the pudding. Again, expensive, but money well spent. Will come back again for sure!",

    "text": "my bf and i were totally looking forward to dining at delmonico.  i like fancy dining, he likes meat, put it together and we usually go to a steakhouse.  however, i did look at the menu beforehand, and noticed there were no crab cakes.  i always have crab cakes before a filet!  so that's probably where the problem started.  i made a reservation a couple months in advance on open table, but even then i could only get a 5:30 rez.  i'm not sure of the entire layout, but it seemed like we were seated in a more private room, which was nice.  the areas we passed through were super loud (staff and wedding party of 20).  gorgeous giant leather seats.  we started off with the \"creole boiled gulf shrimp cocktail with tomato horseradish sauce and homemade crackers\".  there was definitely some BAM in the sauce.  very peppery and lingers.  the crackers were just as spicy, but why are crackers served anyway?  the shrimp itself didn't taste like it was prepared in any special way.  bf had a bone in strip.  i order one of the specials, kobe sirlon.  i'm sorry this had to be my first experience with kobe.  it was TERRIBLE.  pretty on the plate, thinly sliced, with sinewy strands running all through it.  i was mortified with all the chewing.  i partially blame myself.  i knew i should have stuck with my standard filet medium rare.  sigh.  and now i will probably never go back to delmonico.  the sides consisted of overly buttery country smashed potatoes and tiny fried bay scallops (tasted past its prime to me).  we also ordered an additional side of asparagus, also too buttery.  emeril's banana cream pie was good though.  intricately placed bananas seemed to float between layers of banana cheesecake.  the service is decent, but a bit impersonal.  we made a huge stain on the white tablecloth with a piece of dropped meat, and i expected the server to make a joke at least.  total damage, including tip, no drinks, was $195.",

However, the last visit in 2010 was a big disappointment. The food was just average and the service was terrible. My steak came to the table sans the melted butter and the server's solution was to bring a pat of butter several minutes later. There are too many outstanding restaurants for us to ever visit this restaurant again.",

    "text": "This place is a solid four star restaurant.  The decor was modern and minimalist.  Our server helpful and attentive.  The food was great.  We started off with Emeril's cajun BBQ shrimp.  They were just enough to hold us over, a little overcooked, but seasoned to perfection.  My girlfriend had a fillet of halibut over a sweet potato risotto and I had the 22 oz bone in steak rib eye.  I had a taste of the sweet potato risotto, and I thought it was delicately sweet with an interesting flavor.  The halibut  was, well, halibut.  My steak, on the other hand, was a real treat.  The bone does weigh the steak down a bit, but it was still thick and juicy.  It also came with three dipping sauces, which were tasty, but also masked the flavor of the beef.  I'd say use them sparingly.  Another complaint about the actual bone was that it kept the steak from being cooked evenly, one side was noticeably bloodier than the other.  In all, our dinner came out to about $150.  I think for a hearty meal with clean presentation accompanied by wine, not a bad deal, but not a home run either.",

Everyone knows the real reason to go to steak houses is for the side dishes and they do have good side dishes.  Our server was also very friendly about our changing party size and I had no problems with the reservations.  I am giving it 4 instead of 5 bc of ambiance- they could have done a little better here.  It is a little boring and white-walled, plus the bar area feels too open to the casino for me.  Plus side though it is right around the corner from the new Barneys so you can buy bags or shoes before/after.",

The steak I ordered was so tender that it practically melted when I touched it with my knife.  And it tasted even better.  I ordered shrimp with it as well and the each piece of shrimp was the size of my fist.  They, too, were delicious.  I received a small dessert with chocolate gellatto and real whipped cream which was awesome.  The one small misstep was actually the funniest part of the night.  My dad was having a gin and tonic and when he requested our main waiter for another one but with more gin in the drink, the second drink arrived in an even smaller glass.  My dad just sat and stared at the tiny little glass as I sat across the table chuckling for the rest of the evening.  So, it looks like you might not want to criticize the bartender.  Other than the sensitive bartender, the evening went off without a hitch.",

Can't say anything about the drinks: they were delicious and the ingredients were in perfect balance. Except for the fact that we were charged for a tiny bit of their house made vodka sample (i'd never expect 4.5 stars restaurant compromise its reputation by being so cheap towards the diners). Anyway, then the food came... Soaking in butter, it was impossible to eat (i'm not a big fan of straight melted butter or  heated oil). My pasta was floating in grease. Without exaggeration, it was simply a poor sight. The steak was half fat... I mean, really, it's not like you don't see what you put on the grill... We decided to pass on the desert.. The sizes of the cakes were suspiciously big...( usually, if the desert is delicious and served in fine dining place, they are pretty small. It's not that i complain about the huge delicious piece, but ...) So no, i won't recommend it to anyone.",

Not to mention the Prime Dry Aged Filet that was literally \"Cake\" tender and had a deep beef flavor. We also had the Jumbo Australian Lobster tail that was sweet and cooked to perfection in a white wine reduction with aromatic veggies/herbs($95).May I also suggest the Bone In Ribeye($55) which is the house specialty....it's to die for !!!!  In regards to attire it seems like a dressy place but folks were showing up with Tommy Bahama Shirts,Shorts and flip flops and were seated without question and some were \"dudded up\". My wife and I ate for about $200 but it was worth every penny !This a must stop for a special dinner if your a steak lover !!!!   Oh....our table as well as everyone else's had four servers and a host !!!! Exemplary Service",

I chose the beef chili, which was very good, if a tad bit too salty for my taste. The portions were well-sized. The banana cream pie, drizzled with caramel sauce, was the ultimate in banana cream pies. The nice sized slice was overloaded with banana slices and dense banana cream custard, and it was complemented with a fine tender crust, whipped cream, chocolate shavings, and caramel sauce. mmmmmmm...Definitely the best banana cream pie I've ever had, and I've tried quite a few. I look forward to going back when I visit Las Vegas again and trying all the other delicious looking dishes. and their key lime pie! You just have to try the pies!

    "text": "This review is actually an average of two visits.   First visit was back in January of 2013. My friends and I decided to have dinner at delmonicos to spoil ourselves. We were in Vegas for the CES convention so the place was pretty crowded. We had to make reservations in advanced just to make sure we got a table.    So what did we get? Bone-in Rib Eye. It was delicious. It was tender. It was juicy. It was pretty much the best steak I've had so far in my short life. The flavors were amazing and the seasoning was just right..   Then came dessert. I do believe my boyfriend and I had a cheesecake. It was so rich in flavor. While my friends, they had banana cream pies and one had bread pudding. Needless to say, we were very happy. The price was definitely worth it.  Service: N/A Food: A+++++   However, our second visit in August 2013, everything wasn't what we remembered it to be. The steaks were disgustingly different. They were dry. They were rough. I ordered a medium rare and it came out medium. It was NOT tender. It took a lot more effort to chew than it should for something that's $52. There were NO flavor in it and the seasoning was quite lacking.  What the f*ck happened?!?!!!??!!! The steaks tasted like they were fresh steaks versus the dry aged ones that they advertised.   THEIR SERVICE IS FANTASTIC AND IMPECCABLE.   We had brought up the issue with one of the servers and the manager of the location, Doug, took care of us. My friend's steak, and so was mine, was done three times to see if we were happy with the results. My friend's steak was pretty much rare when she ordered medium rare so they tried to correct that for her. They took the steaks off the check and gave us complimentary desserts.   Even though they tried to correct my steak and even though they had amazing service, I'm not sure if their quality control is at work anymore. The quality was a good 180. The piece of meat they gave me was comparable to a $20 steak from Outback or any other random cheap joint versus the $52 price tag. It could be a bad batch, it could be quality control, but I'm not sure if I'd return to the location.  Service: A+++++ Food: F",

I can't wait to come back just to get this, but it was a special, so hopefully they will have it!  The staff was great too. Very helpful and not stuffy at all. I told our waiter I was craving pasta (which is limited on their menu) and he said they could make me a shrimp scampi on the fly.  And I thought their digital wine list was so cool!",

    "text": "I did an all Venetian restaurant tour on my most recent Vegas trip.  I had dinner here the second night of my stay.  We ordered the gnocchi w/ black truffles to start ($25).  For my entree I had a bone-in ribeye w/ foie gras ($72 - $52 for the steak & $20 for the foie gras), my friend had the regular ribeye ($48), and on the side we had haricot vert almondine ($11) & fingerling potatoes ($12).    The gnocchi was very good.  It had a nice crisp and the truffles accented the taste of the potatoes in the gnocchi very well:  4 Stars.  Unfortunately, the steak was not very good.  It was fatty, chewy in some spots and not that flavorful.  The waiter stated that Delmonico's has the best steaks in town.  Sorry, but I have had better steaks at STK and T-Bonz in Summerlin:  2 Stars.  The foie gras was OK.  It was nice to see it on the menu because you can't find it in CA.  However, I was expecting more crisp:  3 Stars.  The haricot vert was just OK too.  The beans were crispy and there were plenty of almonds, but other than that they were nothing to remember:  3 Stars.  Lastly, the fingerling potatoes were too salty, and I am one who generally doesn't notice when dishes are too salty.  The waiter Ken did offer to make a new batch, but the food took a long time to come out and we declined:  2 Stars.  To accompany the meal we had a bottle of COS Pithos Rosso 2008 from Sicily ($85). The winery describes the wine as superbly elegant, subtly meaty w/ a cherry fruit nose.  The palate is profound:  Elegant, pure and mineral with lovely spice and earth notes.  Some complexity, and a bit of tannic structure.  OK, perhaps too much self-promotion, but Delmonico has an extensive wine list at many price points.  The wine was excellent and went very well w/ all the dishes:  5 Stars.  The ambiance was sterile, but there was a good amount of space between the tables.  Unfortunately, the restrooms were lame.  It was quite a walk, there was no valet and only one stall and one urinal.  I had to wait and after I finished, the line was two deep:  2 Stars.  In addition, the service was not very good.  The entrees came at least 35 min after the first course.  Ken, our waiter never stopped by to check on us and let us know it would take a while.  He did redeem himself by agreeing to take the potatoes off the check.  However, he offered us a complimentary dessert and we chose expressos and my friend asked for sambuca also.  We were charged for the sambuca : XXX. If he didn't take the potatoes off the check, I would have given him 1 Star:  2 Stars.  I will not return to Delmonico's the next time I am in Vegas, even though I can walk here from the Venetian where I always stay.  The steak was lousy, the bathroom is lame and the service sucked for an establishment of this caliber.  Word to Emeril:  You need to work on this restaurant - BAM!!!",

Nobody is perfect, but this place... this place is the definition of Perfection. From the smiling hostesses to the personable server, Frank, that not only was warm and welcoming, but even wholeheartedly supported their participation for Restaurant Week. Even explained what Three Square was all about and let us know that the portion of each meal is donated to help the hunger. He genuinely wanted us to participate and even had the RW menu to show us when we sat down. Not like some other steakhouse server *coughcough (Smith&W) that hid this menu unless you mention it and when you do, they treat you cold as winter. Not at this place, you feel like family or a special guest at someone's house. And this is just lunch for crying out loud. Service felt like you're the most important person in the world. Amazing.  Frank was delightful to have as our server. He was informative, attentive, enthusiastic, and just had this kind, easy going presence about him. Getting to know my Father and I throughout our dining experience. It was so nice to have a server that actually wanted to know more about their guests. He was thrilled that we came for Restaurant Week and when I started ordering, he would say.. that's my favorite too love the burrata cheese or after I ordered the Prime hamburgers.. he would say.. that burger is so juicy and delicious, you'll love it. It felt so good that the server is all for it. Even his assistant said thank you each time she took a dish or utensils away. So sweet and kind!  The goods... Everything. There wasn't a single thing that was mediocre. Complimentary bread was like a light croissant mixed with herbs. The appetizers.. My Father had the Heirloom Tomato Soup With Grilled Ricotta Cheese Sandwich, which was so good.. I didn't even get a chance to taste not even one bite of it. He was enjoying it so much that I didn't have the heart to interrupt his food romance. Sh*t. I just wanted one bite!!! *sigh OH well.. I ended up enjoying the Vine-Ripened Heirloom Tomato Salad with my favorite Burrata Cheese, Red onion, Balsamic Vinegar, and Torn Local Basil. It was oh so freshly made. That burrata cheese just makes my day. Loved every single bite of it.  If you come here for RW... a must try.. DELMONICO'S PRIME HAMBURGER. On Toasted Brioche Roll With Fries, Cheddar Cheese, and Bacon. I never in my life had a hamburger like this one. It was first class, first rate, love at first bite. Outstanding flavors. Even the sesame seed bun tasted buttery and oh so soft. So good, so good, unbelievably Deeeeelicious. The size of this burger was enormous. My Father had to cut it up like a steak to eat it. Me, on the other hand ate it like a champ. I was full from eating only half of it, so was my Father. The presentation itself was like art. Even cutting it in half was beautiful. I'll be daydreaming about this burger probably for the rest of my life. My Father kept on laughing, either from the sight of happiness of seeing this magnificent burger or he can't get over how huge this is. Either way, he was enjoying himself and that makes me extremely happy to see. We, both had a splendid time here.   Both desserts were wonderful.  The Banana Cream Pie Parfait with Caramel Sauce, Chocolate Shavings, Whipped Cream, and Graham Crumbs had this cooling effect. It's a great sweet summer treat. Thick cream. The Traditional Bread Pudding With Warm Caramel Pecan Sauce was soothing. Generous amount of pecans. It was a seal deal to a great meal.  After the whole dining experience, this restaurant now tops as one of my favorite places in Vegas. I never had a burger impress me until today. Superb!!! Fantastic service, food, and ambiance. Lovelovelove this place :)",

    "text": "I came for a restaurant week lunch with my two lovelies, Sandra and David and my husband joined before he headed to work. This 3 course was $30.15.  The 3 of us not working that day ordered beverages. This place made my heart sing because they had a Whisky BOOK. To be handed pages upon pages to browse on top of the other spirits, wine menu AND cocktail menus made my damn head spin because I wanted a lot of things. I settled on getting the Scarlet Starlet which had Glenmorangie 10, Tuaca, lime, hibiscus, strawberry and egg whites. It was totally up my alley - very much the scotch shined then the balance of the rest of the ingredients came through. Very much worth the $16 in alcohol and skill in mixing- the bartender Michelle was great.  Appetizer I got VINE-RIPENED HEIRLOOM TOMATO SALAD (With Burrata Cheese, Red onion, Balsamic Vinegar and Torn Local Basil) which was standard, but good because the components were quality and fresh.   Entree I got PAN ROASTED ATLANTIC SALMON( With Sweet Corn & Crab Vinaigrette and Fresh Basil) which was nicely cooked and was very fresh and clean. I liked the large pieces of lump crab mixed in with the corn.   Dessert the hubby and I shared:  BANANA CREAM PIE PARFAIT(Caramel Sauce, Chocolate Shavings, Whipped Cream and Graham Crumbs) was a solid dessert that could convince someone who doesnt like banana cream. The custard in it was creamy while still being light.   TRADITIONAL BREAD PUDDING(With Warm Caramel Pecan Sauce) I love bread pudding and this was good, but average. I do appreciate that the caramel was flavorful while not being saccharine sweet.  I thought it was a solid lunch, but I am coming back for drinks as there's very few places on the strip I've enjoyed the beverage offerings as this. Fantastic beverage program for the libation lover.",

Steak (Ribeye) was cooked to perfection and the seasoning gave it a little extra flavor without overpowering.  Make sure to save room for Emeril's signature banana cream pie.  It was amazing and beautiful.  Each bite was perfectly ripe.  The layering of the pie made it picture worthy.  We also had the lobster bisque and the Bronzino which were good but similar to what I have had at other restaurants.  The highlights were really the steak and banana cream pie. My dirty martini with blue cheese stuffed olives was also spot on. Service was truly exceptional.  Servers worked as a team that was a well oiled machine.  Impressive to see all plates landing at the same time including at the large tables near us.  Ambiance was modern.  Chairs were so comfortable, you can really get comfy and enjoy the meal. To be honest, some meals in Vegas are not always worth the price tag so I was a little skeptical.  I was so happy that this was not the case here and Delmonico's really delivered.",

The mixture itself was bland.. again.. seems to be in the normal scheme of things.. anyway, after a monumental disappointing lunch, I'm gonna head to the room for a nap. 3 am came way too early!",

Three servers were helping us, and they were very attentive throughout the night.   Our meal started off with complimentary bread. It kind of reminded me of yorkshire pudding. It was really light and airy. I liked it because it didn't make me as full.   Both of us ordered the bone-in rib eye cooked medium rare. It was cooked nicely, and it had nice flavors. I didn't realize it while I was eating, but the steak was really salty. I couldn't stop drinking water all night. We also ordered the wild mushroom side dish. This can definitely use less salt. To end our meal, our server gave us a birthday dessert- blueberry sorbet. Because we were so full, we ordered the banana cream pie togo. It was boxed nicely and I was able to enjoy this dessert later that night. It was delicious, but if you don't like bananas, don't get it.   It was an overall pleasant dining experience. I would definitely come back and try other dishes.",

Our salads were very good (Blue Cheese Wedge & Heirloom tomato), and my bone-in ribeye was fantastic. The Asparagus and creamed Spinach were okay. The food was fresh and tasty.   To finish off the meal, I went with the banana cream pie. I've seen pictures of it for a while, and it was very good, and definitely large enough to share. If you like bourbon or Scotch, they have an extensive collection as well. There are better steak houses in Vegas but this is still one of the better ones.",

Tried the bone in rib eye had a decent char but very bland no salt or seasoning, filet mignon was the only good dish but lacked any presentation just a chunk of meat on an oversized plate, bbq shrimp appetizer sauce was flavorless, fried oyster were breaded too much and the green pistachio sauce tasted and looked like baby food, the truffle potatoe chips eere drowned in oil, banana pie also tasted plain. Overall lack of love in the cooking and I could find more flavor at a home town buffet. Maybe an off night but the service was good at least until the server realized I had a comp :o went from 100 to 0 real quick lmao. Still tipped 50$",

The sommelier even happily took back a $120 bottle of wine (guess that's cheap by Vegas standards!) when the 2nd bottle smelled corked.   Appetizers: *butternut squash ravioli - recommended if you love duck! Covered in duck confit.. yummy! *BBQ shrimp - sauce was rich, heavy and delish. It was almost a combination of a gumbo base and bbq sauce *foie gras with berry tart (on the daily specials menu) - wow! if you follow my reviews, you know I'm a foie gras lover, but this one was really excellent. The crossed grill marks on it were beautiful  Main course: *Bone in ribeye - 18 oz of buttery tasty goodness. Well seasoned. Not best steak I've had in my life material, but quite good. *Ahi tuna - huge portion! Cooked to perfection, but the enormous slabs were kind of off putting. I guess when you're paying $42 for freaking tuna you should get something substantial. Plus it makes you feel more like your steak eating companions to have this retarded big portion on your plate.  Sides: *just get the truffle chips.. you will thank me later! *grits covered in bacon couldn't get more fatty :) No complaints here  Dessert: *chocolate bread pudding - very chocolatey! *butterscotch pudding - good but honestly the freebie portion at Bradley Ogden is yummier!!",

Both mine and my husband's rib-eyes were gristly and fatty (neither had marbling that is found in good cuts of meat). About 25% to 30% of our steaks were gristle and fat, which we left on our plates. We both thought the seasoning was boring, but we know that's a matter of preference.  We eat at nice steakhouses (Del Frisco's, Ruth's Chris, Brook's, Morton's, Elway's, Shannahan's) a couple of times a year, so we think we know about quality steak. Our steak and au-gratin potatoes were something a casual dining restaurant like Chili's or Applebee's would serve. Staff was pleasant.

You expect a steakhouse to have that rich dark woods atmosphere.  This was very bland and nondescript in a city that does things to an excess..  The steak, a bone in ribeye was good but not OMG.

The steak is served with a glaze of butter worcestershire, bearnaise and chimichutri sauces. It was huge, beautifully cooked, and tasted good. It was missing one thing for me: SALT! My impression was that it had none. My BF said he liked it as it was. Don't get me wrong, it was a really good steak but it left me wanting more from the flavor spectrum. The potatoes were okay.  Service is always impeccable at Emeril's restaurants.",

The food took a while to make it to the table, which was a little surprising as the restaurant was not busy. My wife loved her filet. My bone in ribeye was good, but by far not the best I've had. The meat was over fatty. The sides were very tasty, including the asparagus and the twice baked potato. I would go again, but I'd order the filet instead of the ribeye.",

I ordered the rib eye steak and we all shared to creamed spinach, the smashed potatoes and the sauteed garlic mushrooms.  They were all really good.

    "text": "Our group of 14 was staying at the Venetian and Delmonicos was our pick for a nice fancy dinner. Since we had a night full of drinking ahead of us, we definitely didn't want to over-stuff our stomachs so each couple agreed to share a steak along with lots of appetizers and sides.   To start off, some of us had the salmon and tuna tartare, wedged salad, baked oysters, french escargot, shrimp cocktail, and lobster bisque. They were all quite tasty!   The BF and I shared a Bone-in Ribeye. Asked for medium rare but it came out medium well. I was disappointed since I really hate eating well done meat. Luckily the flavoring itself was pretty delicious or I'd definitely have to have it recooked. I also had an addition of seared Foie Gras as well - which was the absolute BEST part of my meal. The flavoring and texture was perfect and after my last bite, I found myself wanting more still!  Along with our main entree, we had an order of almost every side they had listed on their dinner menu: buttered asparagus, buttered broccoli, creamed spinach, sauteed garlic mushrooms, mash potatoes, creamed corn gratinee, and potato gratin. All the sides are meant to be shared family style and a scoop of each was more than plentiful to compliment your main course. I loved the creamed corn the most.   As full I already was, I saw expresso creme brulee on their dessert menu so of course I couldn't pass up on that. Glad I didn't either bc it was fantastic!  Service was excellent and our three waiters were extremely attentive and helpful throughout our entire meal. Overall, we had a pleasant dining experience.   3.5 stars because my steak came out medium well instead of medium rare, but because the service was superb, 4 stars it is! Next time, get my steak right please =)",

    "text": "I was (again) lucky enough to have lunch here to participate in an IT seminar for my place of employment.  When has a free steak ever turned me down?  Delmonico was no exception, good food!  I had wanted to try this place before but eating like a king on a pauper's salary just didn't cut it.  Emeril has done a great job with his steakhouse here in Las Vegas.  The presenters for this IT seminar were smart, they decided to make us go though a big chunk of their product presentation BEFORE letting us start to partake in our steak lunch.  That was smooth guys...make us sweat it out!  But the payoff was pretty good.  Our menu was one created by the folks doing the seminar, it was a nice three-course meal.  We started off with Delmonico's Organic Baby Mixed Greens Salad - topped with creole spiced croutons, shaved manchego cheese, teardrop tomatoes, shaved red onions, and a sherry vinaigrette.  Excellent salad, light, tart, salty, and the croutons and red onions (I love them raw if they're sliced really thin) gave it some nice crunch.  Next we had the choice of either a steak or salmon.  Seeing as I was in a steakhouse and that I-like-a-the-beef, I naturally went for a steak.  On the menu was a petite ribeye - which was charbroiled USDA prime aged, creole seasoned, and topped with butter.  Got mine in a nice medium rare.  Boy oh boy, was this a winner!  Tender, succulent, cooked right, a nice kick from the creole seasoning, excellent I say.  I usually like a steak sauce with my steak...but alas, I did not need it!  I sopped up every last bit of the beefy goodness.  The side of Country Smashed Potatoes were good too, but you can guarantee I kept my focus on that lil' slice of heavenly ribeye!  It's up there with one of the most tastiest steaks I've had, and this was only a mini-me of the full size!  I took a look at some of the other diners steaks that weren't in on our seminar, and they were huge!  Delmonico definitely puts out a lot of meat for the money.  We ended the menu with a chocolate tart of some sort, I cannot fully remember it off the top of my head because I really wasted most of my brain power consuming that steak.  But yes, that tart must have been pretty good because I do remember finishing that as well!  Quickly looking at the actual menu, Delmonico is on par with pricing as other steakhouses in the area.  Most steaks are hitting the $40-50 range, sides are around $9 a pop, with desserts around $10.  Not cheap so if you're going here make sure it's a special occasion!  But then again, if you are rich I guess everyday would be a special occasion.",

We were there for a bachelor party.  all of us tried varieties of different cuts. The filet and ribeye were phenomenal. The side selection was not as good as some other steak places I've been too, however it was still good. The only drawback and it was a minor one, was we had a vegan with us. His chef's creation was substandard for a place this cutting edge.",

We had wonderful wine with our meal and great inspiring conversations...it was really refreshing to be out to dinner with people who actually enjoy going out to dinner for 3 hours.

Here's the thing, I love steak, but i'm trying to cut back on being a crazed carnivore. I ordered the half roasted duck (yeah i know it's still meat but it's not red meat...get off my back) and my wife had the halibut. What kind of morons go to a well reviewed steakhouse and don't order steak? Well it's nice to meet you.  My duck was ehh... her fish was ehhh  Had a taste of the ribeye (seriously, shut up...How could I realistically NOT try it?) and wow...REALLY good.  But my rating is only 2 stars you say? Yeah, well my experience was kinda lame...the attentive staff was fine, the prices were completely outrageous even for the strip, and our food was just kinda boring. I didn't think much of it to be honest.  You may be saying... \"Well moron, you ordered duck and fish at a steakhouse, what did you expect?\" I would then reply \"Hey, if it's on the menu, it should be held to the same standards as anything else!\". So There! :P  If I do want to pay too much for a really good steak, I know where to go...but y'know, I'm a local and that is rare. (get the pun...nudge nudge...get it?)  What I will say is that it's a classy establishment and they appear to cook a fine slab-o-meat. But i'd steer (I keep doing it!) clear of any non-cow based items. Sorry for the puns!  I'm not really sorry.",

First off, the ambiance is very simple, understated, and clean. Nothing overly done. In fact, I heard it was on purpose so that you can focus on the food and the people rather than the art and ambiance of the place.  Secondly, service is top-notch. If you're paying the big bucks, it's no wonder. They totally spoil you here and answer all your silly questions!  Thirdly, ANYTHING you order off the menu will be delicious! We each ordered different items and tried each others plates and were blown away. You can't go wrong with anything you order!  Everything was perfectly made and cooked very well and tender. So juicy!

It could be due to the multiple servers making sure we got our drinks and bread.   We shared the bone-in ribeye (18 ounce) and the butternut squash ravioli and was not disappointed. My partner's only regret is not ordering a ribeye all to himself. Additionally, when we split it, we only had one choice of how we wanted it cooked. I like rare, and my partner likes medium rare. It came out perfect for both of us.   The rib-eye was deliciously slightly crispy on the edges with the perfect amount of fat to make it melt-in-your mouth. The flavor was delicious and makes me want more thinking back to it.   The butternut squash ravioli was very delicious as well and a wonderful surprise. We did not know what to expect of it. My partner loved it. He loved the sweet flavor inside the ravioli. I am personally not a huge fan of the sweet potato genre, and it did taste a great deal like sweet potato with butternut squash texture within a delicious ravioli. It deserves a 10/10, it's just not my preference.",

The best thing was the dessert of pecan pie. I'm just going to go there for that!",

I was so upset I didn't even bother to order dessert.  I thought if dessert tastes anything like dinner, I'm not going to bother. Noone bothered to ask how the food was. The chef didn't bother to come to our table,  even though he spoke to individuals at the three other tables surrounding us. Thank God I opted for the indoor gondola ride after dinner which helped to improve my mood for the evening.  I won't be back here or to any of his restaurants. I'm a good person so I still left a very generous tip;  after all it wasn't the waiter's fault the food was just ok.",

    "text": "Yummy!  I didn't realize this was an Emeril (the \"BAM!!!\" guy on the Food Network) restaurant until I looked at the menu.  Cherylynn N. made reservations for a friend's 30th birthday dinner celebration.  Our reservations were at 7pm, but part of our party got lost so we were seated around 7:15-7:30pm.    AMBIANCE: Well lit, but dim which created a \"romantic\" setting for those looking for a date night.  As we had 9 people in our party, we were set up in the middle in umm...an oddly shaped table (see Cherylynn N's description).  The restaurant was packed, but the noise level wasn't too loud.  SERVICE: GREAT service!  The waitress was very attentive.  When the food was brought out, there were 5 servers which each carried our entrees in each hand and simultaneously placed them in front of each of us at once.  It was truly a sight to see.  FOOD: **Note: Most dishes are ala carte, so you'll probably want to order sides.  Sides are big enough for 2-3 people to share**  -Crab Bisque ($12) - Delicious, creamy, and full of yummy flavor!!  This was on the Chef's special list, therefore I am not sure if they have this on a regular basis.  The bisque soup is the same as the lobster bisque, but instead of lobster pieces, its generous portions of crab.  -Jumbo Lobster Tail ($48/Market Price) - As I am not such a big meat eater, a lobster tail was my alternative.  I didn't expect such a generous sized portion to come out.  It was heaven!!  Delicious!!  Tender!!   -Creamed Spinach Side ($9) - It was good, but didn't have the additional pieces of bacon that most restaurants have.  You could definitely tell the spinach was fresh though.    -Creamed Corn Side ($9) - YUMMMMMMM!!  I must come back especially for this side!! The corn was so sweet with a light crust on top.  Words cannot describe how yummy this side was, definitely a must try!!  So I know this is a steakhouse with steak, of course, being their specialty.  My friend insisted that I try some of his rib eye.  I'm not a meat person, but I will admit that it was tender and full of flavor.",

His filet looked so dry and shriveled, I was surprised they served it. There was no \"essence\" only a lot of salt. He chocked it down because he didn't want to disappoint me. I had the chicken breast with fingerling potatoes and onion sauce. Someone must have shaked a cup of salt over everything. I couldn't tell what I was eating and after a few bites said  I wanted to save room for dessert. In all fairness, the service was excellent and the decor classy and not over done. The only thing we enjoyed was the chocolate cake with pistachio ice cream. We live here and have had some very good meals at a few restaurants on the Strip, but would NEVER go to another Emril restaurant. He should be embarrassed and ashamed.",

My bone-in ribeye was cooked to medium and had a creole rub that was delicious.  My son had a huge, huge cheeseburger that was very tasty.    The service was prompt, attentive and courteous.  I grew up in Texas, so I know a good steak when I see it.  The bone in ribeye served here is fantastic.

Don't expect more, I'm not joking. Not a painting, wall paper, photo, drawing or stitch of color. Anywhere. Plain, off white walls.  The bread was lovely (I always taste the bread) I ate it all, without shame.  Specialty cocktails were all great, we tried 3, all of which I forgot the names of but the gin with Midori was my fave, I may have had 2 possibly 3 lol  Food was above average but not mind blowing  King crab app was okay, didn't taste fresh to me  Table side Cesar salad was good, I liked the dressing and loved the anchovies but the presentation was done behind me so I didn't get to enjoy the show. Note to self-when you return don't sit in a booth.   Bone in ribeye was yummy. We shared, but it wasn't the medium my husband ordered but I wasnt devastated because I prefer medium rare although it was closer to rare. Mushrooms were good, nothing special.  Caramel cake was delish, very sweet but that's the point!   We will be back, it will be awhile since date nights are rare due to a 2.5 year old child beast but we will be back. I look forward to the filet.",

It was a Thursday night and the restaurant was not even that busy. The sommelier spent more time checking on us than the wait staff! We had to eat in a hurry and couldn't even finish our meal and had to take it to go. We literally had to run across the street to make it to the show on time. The staff was inattentive and unapologetic. What a complete waste of a $350 meal!  I would recommend dining at The Palm instead where the service is far superior.",

Been dining here well over 15yrs so needless to say, I've seen it, I've ate it, and I've drank it all. And I still keep coming back for more. I invited my friend Anna to join me for this special occasion. So Anna hasn't been to Delmonico before and knew she was in for a treat. My motto is Great Wine, Great Food, Great Company. And I had all three tonight.   I generally bring a couple of bottles of wine from my collection to share with Dillon, the sommelier. This time I brought a 2004 Rubicon 100% Cab Franc and a 1999 Grgich Hill Cabernet. Holy shit the Cabernet was AbFab!!! Perfect in every way.   To start, we had something special from Chef. Then we moved on to the Foie Gras and Oysters. Both Anna and I were trying to play nice and say, \"Here, you take the last bite.\", but deep down we wanted it all to ourselves!!! Next we ordered the Chateaubriand. All the steaks are exceptional, but there's something about this. I think cause it's French. I love everything French. Perfect in every way. Grilled right in front of you to a Medium Rare perfection. This was also accompanied with asparagus and mashed potatoes (I had them add some truffles to the mashers. Well it is my birthday!!!). And for dessert, the birthday ice cream and two shots of Jager. They actually don't have Jager at the restaurant, so they had to go out and find some for me. That's why I love this place. And will continue to come here.",

    "text": "Back to Delmonico three more times for great Louisiana Caviar atop sumptuous Deviled Eggs; light and airy Popovers; mellow Lobster Bisque; traditional black New Orleans Gumbo; fine French Onion Soup; Caesar Salad prepared tableside; buttery medium rare Creekstone Prime Grade Filet Mignon paired with perfectly seasoned Duck Fat Fingerling Potatoes; a nice mix of Garlic Sauteed Mushrooms; coffee prepared with Jamaican coffee beans; amazingly delicious Emeril's Banana Cream Pie with Caramel Sauce, Chocolate Shavings, and Whipped Cream; very memorable Pecan Pie with Oatmeal Shortbread Crust, Vanilla Ice Cream, and Caramel Sauce; and most recently for lunch during Restaurant Week a humongous 15-ounce Prime Grade medium rare Bacon Cheeseburger on a Sesame-Seeded Brioche Bun dressed with tomato slices, lettuce, White Onions, ketchup, and mayo topped by a juicy pickle segment accompanied by very tasty homemade lightly browned French Fries glistening with a sheen of Duck Fat.    Once Diane did not receive her Maitre-D Butter, and her steak arrived with some char and pepper after her specific request not to.  But otherwise food preparation and service were impeccable and working in tandem like a well-oiled machine.  When an apparent miscommunication resulted in receipt of Sauteed Spinach instead of Creamed Spinach, a side of Creamed Spinach was voluntarily and quickly brought to the table as well, without charge.  Both dishes were outstanding.  Our Restaurant Week lunch culminated in a fine finish with a rich Banana Cream Pie Parfait with Caramel Sauce, Chocolate Shavings, Whipped Cream and Graham Crumbs for me; and traditional Bread Pudding with lip-smacking warm Caramel Pecan Sauce for Diane.  For us, based on past experiences, there is every reason to return again for more epicurean delights.",

    "text": "Delmonico Steakhouse does not live up to expectations of a high quality steakhouse.  Had read many reviews that were very flattering which helped nudge a reservation from me to ensure picking a high quality establishment to help celebrate a birthday.  My best guess is that the over the top 5 star reviews recently are from people who have not experienced  a real quality steakhouse such as Delmonico's (no connection to this place) in NYC.  My main beef (pardon the pun) is with the quality of ingredients and in particular, the signature steak on their menu (ribeye), which I had.  This is the one thing this restaurant highlights as their specialty, so it should be a safe bet to ensure a great experience; not so!  It was cooked to order at correct temperature so that is not the problem; the meat simply lacked quality as it was tough, not flavorful, and an inferior cut, which does not happen in a quality steakhouse, particularly one that hails it as their signature steak, so there is really no excuse for this.  Bottom line, I paid $60 for meat that simply could not be a prime cut as they advertise.  My spouse thankfully was pleased with the warm spinach salad and really enjoyed the bread which was actually yorkshire pudding, and a nice surprise!  My sides for the steak are not worth mentioning as they were not up to quality standards.  The food service was relatively proficient.  The restaurant ambiance was somewhat sterile and lacking character.  We did receive a single complimentary scoop of sorbet for the birthday acknowledgement so that was the biggest highlight!  I would normally give a restaurant multiple tries but in this case, never again, no point, they are cutting corners on quality, so beware!",

Additionally, the steak just wasn't mind blowing -- truly it was an OK piece of steak, for a table of three the tab was $266 (no big deal) but certainly not worth coming back, or raving about (the STEAK) this is a steakhouse, I expected much more.  The herbed fries are EXCELLENT, very tasty! The fried cauliflower was EXCELLENT!  Also had their fried pork (pigtail) had a little kick to it and no complaints.",

So when I go restaurants that are fancy, classy and upscale I immediately feel like everyone in there can tell I don't belong. I don't know what fork is for what. I don't know where to put my napkin when I get up from the table and I swear everyone else notices. I also don't venture to fancy, classy and upscale places cause I almost always hate the food. The fancier the words on the menu the less I wanna try it.   This is NOT that kind of place. Yes, it is fancy, classy and upscale. Yes the menu is a bunch of jibberish food.  But somehow I was still able to make out a few key words to order what was Caprese salad and Potato Soup. HOT DAYUM DUDE: Emeril is no joke. The Caprese was so fresh. The tomato tasted like it was picked 15 minutes before it was cut and placed beautifully on my plate. The Potato soup had big chunks of bacon at the bottom and the server poured my soup over it. Then added a junk of Parmesan cheese and yuuum.  In other fancy, classy and upscale joints I feel uncomfortable to even speak to my serious server. Not this guy. Our server was casual yet still very serious about his job. He even cracked a smile a few times.   I cannot rave enough about this place. It was beautiful and elegant, delicious and exciting flavors. I loved every second of Delmonico  My two small complaints 1. The bathroom smells like wet rocks. Its has really cook huge rock walls but since its in a bathroom it smells weird. You know the smell of a dirty lake? That is the smell the bathroom had. 2. This restaurant is inside the Venetian and VERY hard to find. There are no signs. None. Pointing you toward it. So from me to you: If you find the huge LOVE sign for the Beatles show it is directly to the right, almost hidden by the sign and the elevator.",

They took long to even bring bread & butter and when they brought the bread, it was a cold and stale croissant. 2. My boyfriend and I ordered the bone-in Ribeye steak and it was OK. It was tender and juicy, just not served hot as a steak should be, which made the steak start getting colder and tough to eat throughout the dinner. 3. The only great tasting thing that we ordered was the potato croquettes. Those are amazing and is definitely a MUST to order!",

My 16 oz. boneless NY strip was cooked perfectly while ordering it Oscar style was well worth the $30-a large amount of terrific crab with just enough Hollandaise and well cooked and sauteed asparagus.

It was the perfect dessert, and I loved it!   I sat in the bar area where they had a great piano player, and the atmosphere was friendly & lively.  My server & the staff were also very friendly.  I look forward to trying their lunch & dinner sometime in the near future, but I can tell you that the next time I want Pie & Coffee, I'm heading back there!",

    "text": "Came here for the first time for lunch for Restaurant Week on a Saturday. We had made a reservation for 1230P. Most of us had arrived before the time but one had run late. The hosts in front were very accommodating and were fine with the tardiness. Once the last person had arrived about 15 minutes late, we were promptly sat at the table.   This \"seasons\" Restaurant Week (06/2019) Lunch menu is as follows:  First Course \"Heirloom Tomato Soup\" w/ whipped ricotta cheese and fresh basil \"Beef Carpaccio\" w/ parmesan reggiano, wild arugula, crispy capers, roasted garlic emulsion \"Organic Baby Mixed Greens Salad\" w/ creole spiced croutons, sherry vinaigrette, shaved Manchego cheese, teardrop tomatoes and red onions  Second Course \"Delmonico's Bacon Cheese Burger\" on a Brioche bun w/ apple bacon, Wisconsin cheddar, and sea salt fries \"Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich\" on a Brioche bun w/ deviled egg yolk, heirloom tomato, bibb lettuce, and sea salt fries \"Pappardelle Pasta\" w/ lemon ricotta, wild mushrooms, white wine butter, english peas, fava greens and basils  Third Course \"Banana Cream Pie Parfait\" w/ caramel sauce, chocolate shavings, whipped cream, and graham cracker crumbs \"Pecan Pie\" w/ oatmeal shortbread crust, vanilla ice cream and caramel sauce   All the \"first courses\" were chosen among the 6 of us. Most picked the \"Beef Carpaccio\" which was surprisingly large. I'd say its probably the normal size they serve too. Give or take 10 slices but good amount of toppings allowing little \"wraps\" of carpaccio HEHE. the capers were deep fried adding a nice crisp aspect with the nice flavor of arugula. The roasted garlic emulsion added a nice creamy flavor, binding it all together. Some fresh cracked black pepper on top was a good touch  Originally a lot of people were planning on getting the pappardelle pasta but ended up switching over to the cheeseburger. I had been keeping my eye on Delmonico's for a few years now during Restaurant week, and I feel like this burger stays on the menu every time.   I had gotten my burger cooked medium. It was nice and juicy. Red onions, lettuce, tomatoes on the side. Friend flipped off her red onions, literally... landing on her bread plate Lol. The fries were ok. Not much of a fan of semi-thick fries. Id prefer thinner or like steak fries. This is somewhere in the middle. There's a side cup of mayo and ketchup as well   Finally, the dessert. Most of us got the Banana Cream Pie Parfait whereas one had gotten the Pecan Pie. Huge fan on banana cream pie ever since i was little. These parfaits were in little mason jars w/ graham cracker crumbs on the bottom, banana cream and sliced bananas in the middle, topped with a caramel sauce and chocolate shavings. Overall, decent, but not REALLY good. (maybe cuz i have a banana cream pie at home so im kind of killing the experience lol). Had a bite of the pecan pie as well. Overall, pretty good but really sweet.   Overall, good experience. Service was great ! All items were brought out at the same time by multiple servers, making it a nice experience as well. They split the bill willingly. Took a while though but still a good experience.",

    "text": "Open table reservations worked fine, and even though we arrived 30 minutes earlier they easily accommodated us with our reservation.   The restaurant is deceivingly bigger inside and the tables were well spaced out which made a quiet intimate dining experience.  Service was excellent and timely with all the courses, including our wine service.  They have an extensive wine list and full bar menu.  Started out with the French Onion soup, which is highly recommended.  Very deep in flavor and not salty as many  soups can be, we followed this with entrees of the NY  Strip, Colorado Rack of Lamb, and a shared side of Cheddar Grits.  Both entrees were prepared exactly as requested, resulting in very tasty  and tender entrees.  The grits were very  good, but are different with more body to them, which our server explained before we ordered them, that due to the freshness of the grits they will be this texture (much appreciated for the description before ordering them).  Finished the dinner with a selection of Sorbets and a French press coffee.  The only criticisms I would have, is even though service was excellent, it was a little confusing on the many  people helping with our service, and the dining area is a bit dark in spots which makes it difficult to see the menu or the table.  Overall the food and service were excellent and what I would expect for this level of restaurant, and we will definitely be back again in the future.  Hints for your visit: Check out the front pages of the extensive wine list,  there is  a list of recommendations by the restaurant, which makes it easy to select a nice bottle of wine for the novice.  If you like sorbet, the Cherry sorbet was very good and a  great ending to the heavier meal.",

Don't let them catch you sleeping, though, because these are some fine hunks of beef for a little less than your fancy Vegas steakhouses. Of course, the bone-in's will net you the most flavor, so if you want 20oz of perfectly seared cow, $60 is what it'll cost you. For starters, I highly recommend their charred octopus, which isn't tough in the least. I heard that their barbecue shrimp wasn't as good as New Orleans, but it was not bad at all. Delmonico also has a decent wine list and popovers whenever you want (they really aren't fantastic though). All in all, solid service with lower-than-usual decibel levels and some damn good beef.",

I ordered the Gumbo to start and it was as good as any you will taste. Just enough spice plenty of heat. I know its a steak house however the Tuna tartar is one of my favorites. It was delish just the right amount of seasoning and a nice sauce to compliment it. I would order this again.  What can you say about the service. Other restaurants should follow the one thing they insist on. Everyone is served their main course at the same time.  If you have never dined at Delmonico you need to add it to your bucket list.",

I eat here often when I am in Las Vegas and it is definitely the place to go.   The steak is exactly how you want to eat it. I eat my often rare, but sometimes medium-rare. Either way what you order is what you get. The meat is tender and soft and is seasoned just perfectly. I have never sent anything back when it comes to the steak. I have been with people who order medium rare thinking that this place is like others where you order one thing and get a steak more cooked than you order, but not here!   I recommend a side order of the fingerling potatoes with your steak as they go great hand in hand!!   Just a side note if you order the burger be prepared for a mouthwatering experience. I know many do not order burgers at Steakhouses, but if you do this is the place to do it!   Will be back as I always do!",

It's not as though women aren't allowed, it just feels like the girl to guy ratio is about 1/15.  But the steaks are as good as it gets.  We come here every year for the finale of our March Madness trip, and it never fails to impress.  We always order way too much food, yet we always figure out how to stuff it in somehow.  The seafood tower is amazing, tableside caeser a must, and you will never go wrong with a filet here.  As a side note, someone at our table ordered a filet well done (huh?) and it came out thoroughly pink.  I loved that - they basically said \"this is the most we are willing to cook this perfect piece of meat for you before ruining it.\"  You won't be disappointed!",

    "text": "At the beginning of this current \"Celebrity Chef\" era there were few names on Emeril Lagasse's level, and although the Massachusetts native who made his name cooking in Louisiana has slowly faded from television his three Las Vegas Restaurants remain popular destinations with Delmonico Steakhouse having just celebrated its twentieth Birthday.  Now old enough to be considered iconic in a city of constant change, Delmonico's grand-opening coinciding with that of The Venetian where no other space along Restaurant Row remains the same, guests entering the space in 2019 will find little has changed over the last decade or more, even Chef Ronnie Rainwater still at the helm for what may be an unprecedented tenure.  Arranging this visit as a work event, six guests sitting down to a four-course menu with Wine at $125 per person, it was unfortunately late as a result of traffic that things got started at 7:00pm, warm Popovers and Delmonico's signature Potato Chips with Truffle Oil and Cheese delivered quickly, though the latter seemed a bit hurried with some spuds crispy and tan while others were white and flaccid.  Having not requested tthe Wine Pairing, even small pours somewhat wasteful on a group of mostly teetotalers who had to work the next day, it was beginning with Sparkling Rose from Ruinart that creamy Burrata and Apricots were presented, the request for \"family-style\" service in reality just two menu-sized servings on separate plates with each diner receiving just over a mouthful inclusive of Toast and Salad.   Aware that Chef Rainwater was out on a well-earned family vacation, his second in command presenting each course while Sommelier and servers were polite and professional from beginning to end, course two featured Pan Roasted Sea Bass alongside Spring Vegetables, a plethora of Morels particularly welcome though the Fish's \"family style\" partitioning limited most to less than three-ounces.  Admittedly impressed by small sips of Chardonnay, Delmonico's continuous recognition by Wine Spectator since 2004 no small feat, course three placed Lamb Chops cooked rare alongside a Grenache-Mourvedre-Syrah blend, the Flesh itself young and minimally gamey but complimented well by both the Wine and minty Peas plus Carrots enlivened by Chimichurri.  Still suggesting \"family style\" as two menu portions of each dish, the main course of Creekstone Farms house-aged Ribeye accompanied by six wedges of cheesy Potatoes plus Sprouts and Asparagus, it was without other requested sides that plates were cleared, though guests who'd held out for Carbernet were notably praiseful of the selected pairing.  Finally serving True \"family-style\" for Dessert, though one slice of Emeril's famous Banana Cream Pie divided by six assumes a lot about guests' willingness to share, fans will be happy to know that both Banana and Pecan Pie remain Sin City's best while Cake, Cookies and tiny Donuts a touch heavy with Oil are merely average.  THREE STARS:  It was prior to starting Endoedibles that I first encountered Emeril's food, but at his restaurant in Orlando was probably the first place I ever enjoyed \"fine dining\" at the grand old age of 21. Only financially able to start traveling years later, it was in Las Vegas that I next crossed paths with the man who made \"BAM!\" a catchphrase, in 2008, and having now visited a fourth time I'm comfortable saying little has changed at his Steakhouse in terms of Food or service, though in terms of value for the dollar this meal would have been better ordered a la carte.",

The steakhouse is like the Tardis,  bigger on the inside. Definitely manly vibes,  we were the only all girl group. We went straight for the kill though,  truffle oil potato chips,  creamed spinach, filet mignon and salmon.  The truffle chips were amazing.  The spinach so-so, I think the vego sides were underwhelming.  The filet mignon was soft, scrumptious, just seared lightly and delicious. Sadly,  could not partake the salmon as it was cooked together with sausage slices and bits of bacon. SADNESS. Rookie mistake,  I saw salmon and didn't read the fine print. Very satisfying.   There is no ambience but just good solid food and excellent table service.",

    "text": "As a mitigation strategy for rationalizing the relative discomfort of Las Vegas prices, gambling losses, and conspicuous consumption, my dad always says:  \"Well, I'm not here for a haircut.\"  Indeed, Father.  And it's always made me feel better when the Wild Cherry machine quickly eats my $20 bill and gives me nothing but the need to wash my hands again, or the adage, \"Everyone's a winner at the Tropicana!\" fails the smell-test.  All that to say, when I visit an upscale steakhouse that Yelp describes as \"$$$$,\" there exists a certain level of expectation in terms of service, ambiance, and of course, food quality.  To beleaguer the point, I have specific expectations for a $1.49 Quarter Pound Big Bite hot dog at 7-Eleven.  And when you don't \"get what you pay for,\" the cognitive dissonance weighs on your heart, the opportunity cost of selecting this meal instead of a different option cuts a little. Or a lot.  Our party of ten made an 8 P.M. reservation, celebrating my brother's 40th.  For a first course, I ordered the gumbo.  With visions of Emeril kicking it up a notch, I was hoping for a robust roux, a balance of savory of the thyme and bay, the sweet of the andouille and shrimp, and a little spicy bite of Worcestershire to hold it all together.    The soup was poured from the pan at the table over  rice.  Nice touch....  ... except at first bite, it was a disappointment to me.  First, despite being poured from the pan (which didn't convince me either, but they could have easily faked it for $14 soup) it was cold.  (So was my wife's tomato soup; so was my cousin's lobster bisque.) Second, the few pieces of andouille sausage as well as the shrimp in the gumbo had the consistency of Vienna sausages-- mushy and bland.  Third, the rice it was poured over gave me the impression it was buttered and reheated... but like the soup, not to a temperature that would even be considered warm.  The gumbo was a big miss for me.  The server presented a cheerful amuse bouche: a slice of cucumber with a white bean paste, garnished and drizzled with truffle oil.  Always nice to receive a little something from the chef, but couldn't help but wonder if my gumbo sat somewhere cooling off while the small gift from the chef was prepared.  Can't go wrong with truffle oil, and that's a good thing, as it stays with you for a while.  I ordered the salmon, and Mrs. Picante ordered the shrimp pesto pasta.  I ordered my salmon medium rare, and like the steaks my brothers ordered, it cooked correctly but cool to the touch.  Soft, flavorful and unfishy, the chef was very sparing with seasoning or salt-- which for me, is a good thing, as I enjoy the natural flavor of salmon.  Unfortunately, the salmon was served atop a bed of potato and andouille sausage hash, spicy onion crust and \"homemade Worcestershire.\"  The crunchy onions were good, but I didn't care for them with the salmon; the underbedding of potatoes, sausage, tomatoes and sauce sort of all mixed together and got sort of ketchup-ey.  It was ok, but felt overdetermined for $38 with a Snickers bar-sized piece of salmon.  Baked potato side ($9) was large and cooked well.  My bride's Gulf Shrimp and Torchio pasta arrived lukewarm at best.  The menu described this dish as containing \"guanciale, wild mushrooms, white wine butter and toasted bread crumbs\"...  She found a mushroom stem in one bite; no mushroomS to speak of, but at least the shrimp were large and \"snapped\" appropriately when you chewed them. Not enough guanciale in the dish to include it as the first ingredient in the menu... still don't have the heart to tell my bride it's pork, which she doesn't eat.  I have no delusions that a $60 steak is three times better than a $20 steak; I've been intimately affiliated with enough restauranteurs to understand this.  But I also have come to understand that dim lighting, amicable and attentive service, a diverse wine list, and the great panache that must accompany this anchor tenant restaurant in the vaunted halls of the Venetian Las Vegas don't amount to much if the food is anything less than impeccable.   Lest you dismiss me as a poor kid in expensive shoes, I'll simply state, Dear Reader, that I've enjoyed dinners at modest San Felipe fish taco stands with dirt floors, opulent dining in an exclusive three Michelin starred Shanghai restaurant, casual single-plate meals at unassuming brasseries, big messy burgers on fishing boats, and dishes plated with twelve textures, whose drink-pairing doubles the price.  In each of those cases that merited approbation and aplomb, price matched the quality of the food, the ambiance, and the service.  Also, hot food was served hot, so there's that.   Unfortunately, our trip to Delmonico did not rise to that level, which begs the question: based on the range of reviews that accompany mine, was it simply yet sadly an outlier experience at an otherwise fine establishment, or is there truth to Jim Collins' assertion, \"Good is the enemy of great\"?",

    "text": "Not sure I can really go into some drawn out review here. I've eaten here several times over the last ten odd years, and it's always been one of the better steakhouses. Each visit seems to get a little better. Sometimes the sides don't come out exactly like I would prefer, (sounds like a personal problem to me) but the steaks are always cooked and taste pretty damn perfect.  I've been sticking with the filet mignon last couple times, and it's the best one I've had that I can remember. The lobster bisque is really good, with some big chunks of lobster. Last time in we got the duck fat fingerling potatoes, overall didn't care for them, but once again, I was expecting something else. The roasted brussel sprouts, I pretty well hate brussel sprouts, but these were pretty good. The steamed broccoli, which was really good.  Anyway, service is always fantastic. Never a bad choice to come here.",

Prices are also more than reasonable for the quality and portions you are receiving.  Every staff member we encountered here was a joy. They are all very personable, pleasant, and have a sense of humor while still taking their job seriously. From the host station to the wait staff, the service absolutely blew my mind. It's obvious that they want the customer to have the absolute best experience possible and the staff are clearly  working hard to meet every guests needs, often before we even know we need anything! I truly can't rave about the service enough.  The food was also very good. At our table, we had the french onion soup, lobster bisque, bone-in ribeyes, smashed potatoes, and mushrooms. We would recommend all of them! Honestly though, the food could have been sub-par and I would still go back for the incredible service!   Also of note, the restaurant interior definitely feels upscale, and it seems silly to mention, but the chairs are very comfortable!   I cannot recommend Delmonico Steakhouse enough.",

We called for reservations on the day of, and they were able to accommodate us. When we arrived early, we sat in the bar area, and we had the most amazing drinks we both had ever had. I had a \"green spade\" which had cucumber, basil, and some other stuff in it. It was light, not to sweet and delicious. He had a bloody orange, which is a whiskey cocktail, and he loved it equally. I also had a limelight, which was good, and the best was the dark roast....delicious, smooth and incredible. They were about $14 a piece, and worth every damn penny. We were seated 15 minutes early. We told the waiter that this was our first \"casual fine dining\" experience, and he was more than informative. Made suggestions throughout the meal, and was personable and forthcoming. They had a nice \"Our top Picks\" for the wine. We chose a mid-price cab sav. They gave us complimentary truffle cream for an app, and then we ordered the tuna to go with it. The tuna was just average, but we live in Cocoa beach, so it's hard to impress us with seafood. The main event was the bone-in ribeye. I have eaten a shit ton of steak in my life....and DEAR GOD. This steak was impeccable. I didn't need a knife, I used my fork to cut it. The seasoning was just right, and I ordered mine rare, and that was how it was. My husbands was just the right medium rare....and perfect. Now, the only negative part of our meal. I ordered fingerling potatoes and asparagus as our sides. I had to send the potatoes back. They were nearly raw, and dry. The asparagus was edible, but boring. At nine dollars a piece, I expect a little zing. We were too full for dessert, but I'm sure it was great. The service was perfect, three waiters to a table. I was impressed with our overall bill total. They gave us cards that detailed where we sat and what waiters we had, so that we could have the same ones next year when we return for our anniversary. I will def be willing to return for another beautiful, whole experience.",

    "text": "I'll make this one an easy read.   I have been to this steakhouse 4 times since it has opened. The 1st time being within it's 1st month, the last several weeks ago.  My 1st 2 visits were awesome, great steaks and sides and good service, then something happened on my 3rd trip about 1 1/2 years ago, the food was just o.k. not horrible but nothing that great. Well a few weeks ago we were back at the Venetian.  I was there with my Wife, 2 sons(16 and 5) and my Sister in Law, everyone wanted steak, so we decided why not let's try Delmonico's.  Turns out this was a bad choice and one that will keep me from going back, with all the new crops of good steakhouses(many within the same hallway) that have popped up since this place has opened, Delmonico's needs to get it's act together.  We ordered 3 Rib Eyes, 1 Filet, and my 5 year old got a burger. For sides truffled potato chips, mashed potatoes and corn.  When we were sat, we immediately were served water and our drink orders taken, that was the highlight of the meal. It took about 20 minutes to get our drinks and orders taken. When we asked if they had anything specific for our 5 year old, they suggested the burger, fine he can have that, if not my Wife would have just split some of her filet with him  When our food came about 50 minutes later, mind you the place had just opened and there were no more than 4 other tables occupied. They put all our food down in front of us and they then proceeded to give my son a burger that had to have been at least 12 ounces, we all looked at each other and then commented on how and why would they serve him that.  Mind you, waiter suggested this burger for the 5 yr old.  Back to the other plates, it was just large chunks of flavorless meat, the sides were bland and the truffled chips were soaking in oil. When it was all over and done we had been there almost 2 hours and were out almost $300. I have no problem spending good money for a good meal, but this meal left us feeling like we had wasted our time and our money.  Will not go back.",

    "text": "Delmonico in Las Vegas by Emeril Lagasse is not as impressive as I would expect it would be. First we are given a really lousy table in the corner as if my husband has been very bad that he deserve to be punished in the corner(considering this is his special day-b-day). Waiters are clueless, they are just standing in the middle but most of the time really doing nothing that in few ocassions I have to pour my own wine in my glass. The head waiter is the only one who seems to be working and who do know what to do here.             We are given a small apetizer courtesy of the chef bec of my husbands b-day which is a good touch, I love this little appetizer (not in the menu, wish it was there because that would be the only highlight of the evening) a concoction of smoke chicken with couscous with a little spices, the taste is all balance and in harmony.            The fried green tomatoes appetizer is bland, whatever coating and sauce they put in there didnt help at all.  The spinach and raddichio salad is soaked on its own dressing which you cannot even tell which dressing it is, salads when presented are supposed to be crisp, so make sure you only put the dressing when it is ready to be eaten, very disappointing since the head weater gladly recommended this dish.           My husband ordered Bone in Ribeye Steak, huge, cooked perfect but no taste or seasoning at all, it would need some sort of sauce to make it appetizing.  Filet mignon is OK, just like any other filet mignon, nothing great about it.          Luckily there's one dish that is worth mentioning, the potato gratin dauphineous, excellent, potato perfectly cooked, not much cream, hint of garlic and toasty top, excellent!         Going back? No way, very expensive and I'm not happy.",

No flare at all to it.   Here is what i either ordered or tried:  Lobster bisque - Very good. Creamy and rich, yet the lobster came through right away.  Steak Tartare - Good.Had a bit too much mustard sauce for me, as that was about all i could taste. But the meat had alot of flavor.  Lamb chops - Very well done. The lamb was cooked well(medium rare) and was nice and juicy.   I ordered the ribeye(rare). I thought it was on the verge of medium rare, but totally acceptable. Nice flavor, and good portion. Not the best steak i have had, especially since the waiter said it was both wet and dry aged.   Sauteed spinach - Very good, but i would have preferred a bit more creaminess to it. Although i am not sure if it was supposed to be cream spinach or not, it seems almost like it was halfway between steamed and creamed. either way it was a very good side dish.  Filet - Very well cooked and tender. I found the truffle crust lacking in flavor though, as i could not really taste it at all.  And i want to say halibut, but i could be off. Either way, the special fish entree was probably the best of the night. Cooked just right, and the sauce was excellent.  Overall i liked the dinner alot. For the price though it was nothing all that special.",

Us clods just wanted a delicious slab of steak, some wine and we'd be happy and Delmonico was there to provide.  The only shortcoming was the wait to take our orders, but once our waiter came, it was all good.  The wait staff had a great sense of humor which added to the night's festivities (hell they were serving a bunch of goofballs).  Of course, the best part was the steak.  Most of us at the table had the bone in ribeye steak.  Let me first say I didn't eat much of anything that day in anticipation of this dinner and we didn't have any appetizers or salads and I STILL couldn't finish off that piece of meat!  My steak was perfectly cooked medium rare and was wonderfully seasoned.  Thanks to Delmonico for tolerating the circus sideshow and cooking up some awesome meat..  and sorry to housekeeping that we ordered 4 orders of asparagus!",

    "text": "Very disappointing.  The worst cocktails I have ever had anywhere.  I tried 3 different drinks and I didn't like any of them.  The lobster cost a whopping $75 and was not that big and was a little tough.  Service was great and the side dishes were good.  However, I love barbequed shrimp and have eaten it in New Orleans many times and it was much better - and this is supposed to be Emeril's signature dish.  The sauce was brown and not that spicy.  The lobster bisque was just ok - I have had better in my town of 150,000 and it usually has sherry in it - not there.  There were nice chunks of lobster in it though.  We expected more from an Emeril restaurant and really didn't feel that it had a Louisiana flair, although apparently it specializes in steaks.  Will not visit again and it has cooled us to the possibility of trying another of Emeril's restaurants in the future.  I cannot emphasize strongly enough how terrible all 3 cocktails were.",

My steak was was cooked to perfection, juicy throughout. not to mention the little things such as the pat of compound butter that added that punch. The lobster bisque was smooth and rich. The sides we're all great as well.   The pricing was fair, it is a la carte steakhouse after all thats what you come to expect at an establishment like this. Service was just right, very attentive but at the same time the wait staff wasnt breathing down our neck. Loved my experience here, hopefully we will back again soon!",

    "text": "My boss reccomended Delmonico's to me in a SERIOUS way, so when I had a chance to go to Vegas with some big foodies, I immediately suggested we try it out. We made reservations for 10:00pm on the Friday we were all scheduled to arrive. We were all coming seperately from different airlines and different cities and planned to meet at the airport and head out. I. WAS. PUMPED. Super damn excited.   And then my flight was delayed. I hate Southwest-- this is what happens when you try to be cheap but still end up paying $250 to fly for half an hour from LA to Vegas. My flight was delayed and delayed and I started to really worry. I worried in the terminal while I nervously sipped my venti coffee. (I swear I had ordered a tall?) I worried for the TWO HOURS I spent sitting on the plane on the runway, trying with much difficulty to bury my face in Harry Potter 7 while I sat next to a really annoying and \"overly affectionate\" couple. (Seriously... DON'T DO THAT. WTF!? Have you no decency!?! Where the fuck is your mother!??!)  I landed at 10:00, booked it to the cab line, sprinted through the Venetian in heels, and, sweaty, restless, tired, and uncomfortable with my carry-on bag, met my friends at the bar in Delmonico's at 10:20. My entire excursion from my house in Los Angeles to the restaurant in Vegas took 4 hours. I'm pretty sure I could have driven. I wanted to die.  Was it worth it? YES IT WAS.  Grey Goose and tonic: strong enough to keep me from death type of worth it. Beer and cheese fondue with pretzel bread: salty-cheesy goodness type of worth it. Oysters Rockefeller: I don't even like oysters and it was worth it. Truffle parmesan potato chips: the light, crispy, addicting type of worth it. Salad with fresh fried mozzarella: I want to eat this cheese until I gain 400 pounds and have to be air-lifted out of my house type of worth it. Dry Grilled Aged Sirlion a la Oscar with Blue Crab: I was so full at this point I could only eat two bites of this and it was STILL worth it. Three different attentive waiters: I get a little chill when waiters murmur \"Pardon my reach\" under their breath like it's a secret type of worth it.  The menu looked expensive (around $50 for entrees) but our table, for 4 people with a half bottle of wine, cocktails, entrees for each, soups/slads, and appetizers came out to around $400. It was pretty reasonable for the volume and quality of food we ate, but, really now, $400 is spendy. I won a little bit of money over the weekend, so now I can afford to go back. And I will be back!",

This trip was for my boyfriend's birthday, so I wanted something Italian and steak as he requested. This was by far one of the best dinners we have ever had. The food was amazing from salads to lobster bisque to a book of a wine list to the Chateaubriand Carved Tableside for Two, which was basically a filet for two cut into strips at our table. It was superb! It has been 3 months and we're still talking about it! My only issue was that the green salad was too salty. Besides that, the steak and sides were seasoned to perfection. The atmosphere was quiet and as if in a well furnished dry wine cellar; very romantic.  All in all, it was VERY expensive but worth every penny. I recommend this to anyone looking for a high end romantic steak dinner in Vegas.",

It was simply unrivaled by any other steak I've ever had and probably any other steak I ever will have.  I sincerely doubt that in my life I will ever -- EVER -- have a better steak.  It was perfectly cooked, and coated with the perfect amount of pepper and spices on all sides.    Secondly, but certainly not any less impressive, was the ceasar salad.  As somebody who orders ceasar salad everywhere she goes, I would venture to say that this was in the top three I've ever had -- I could probably even safely say it was the best.  Served with whole leaves, which I love, and the dressing was made at our table, right in front of our eyes.  Cannot be beat.",

I can't remember what everyone ordered but I can tell you that nobody complained about the food (not drunk yet and therefore enjoyed the food fully).  The bone-in Ribeye was marvelous.  The Calamari was good as was the steak tartare. Side dishes: New Orleans Creamed Spinach, Truffle Parmesan Potato Chips and Sauteed Garlic Mushrooms were all excellent!  The sides are quite large so please share because yeah, we ordered too many.  Total bill for 13 (which included some drinks) was about $1100 which is not bad for a nice high-end place that serves THE BEST RIBEYE.

The wine that he recommended paired extremely well with our meal.    Yes, the walls are cream colored.  But it's a very clean, fresh feel.  The table are nice and roomy.  The chairs are so big and comfortable, you can sit there for hours enjoying your meal and drinks.  The accent colors in there are a tuscan red, so imagine a nice warm, bright feel.

After I took their picture, one of the guys said I did a \"good thing\" back there when he saw me paying for us :)  He said I was \"a good woman.\"   One gripe - for our business dinner, we had a party of about 16 and they sat us at 2 tables in the main dining area.

    "text": "Top notch steaks and one of the best wine lists in Las Vegas. Perfectly seasoned and prepared steaks in the main dining room makes for a great night out, but what makes The Delmonico Steakhouse a DESTINATION is their individually planned and prepared tasting menu, available during an evening at their special Kitchen Table.   They have a glass room with space for 8, connected to the kitchen where you'll enjoy a special tasting menu prepared by the Chef on duty. And when I say special menu, I mean just that. Chefs are passionate about menu planning and specialty food and they'll give you a 6-8 course meal featuring the steak of course, and many other things not available on their menu, finished with a dessert tray to die for, featured every one of the desserts they offer.   This is an Emeril restaurant but you won't see any made for TV dinners here - it's truly an authentic steakhouse with an upscale dining room. For the wine lover, Master sommelier Kevin Vogt will work with the chef to perfectly pair wine with each course. What is special, as of my last visit, is The Delmonico Steakhouse runs independent of the other food services at The Venitian. This means they shop for their own food and manage their own wine collection. So if you enjoy fine wine, perfectly paired with your meal - this is the place for you.   This is my #1 all time favorite restaurant. The food is good enough to stand on its own, and because of the special treatment you get at the kitchen table, I've yet to experience anything so great.  How much? You'll be shocked and surprised to learn this dining experience isn't terribly expensive. For a little more than you'd spend in the dining room, you get a personal dining experience, about $85 for dinner and wine pairing for about $65.  I call this a once in a lifetime experience, even though I've been lucky enough to do it about ten times.",

    "text": "Superb!  I'm sure people can knock off stars if their steaks didn't come out to their liking (heck I would too), but all four of ours came out exactly as we wanted them to.  I'm not a big fan of Ermiril's show, nor am I a fan of his personality.  Despite having his name associated with this restaurant, I feel that if he's not the one cooking my meal, then it's not really his food.  Whoever the chef was that night sure had his mojo going that's for sure.  The cocktail shrimp appetizer was amazing.  Cocktail shrimp you say?  How different can that be from Bellagio's buffet where you can get like 1000 in one sitting if you wanted?  Well considering you're saving your stomach for more desirable substances, the dish contained eight snicker bar sized prawns drizzled with a fine cocktail sauce that had a nice kick to it.  It was more than enough to satiate us before the main course.  When our meat came out, my buddy and I couldn't stop drooling.  The girls had to laugh as their softball sized fillet's looked more like golf balls in comparison to our full-sized cow bone-in Rib-Eyes.  Literally the size of the plate itself, and at least 1.5 inches thick....Vegans would run in fear at the sheer size of this holy beast.  The rib eyes were cooked perfectly throughout.  Medium-rare, a beautiful mix of pink and red with a perfectly charred (requested) exterior that seared all the juices in and added wonderful flavor to the aged meat.  If this wasn't a proper meal we would've gone to town on the bones like cavemen at the end.  Truly magnificent.  And to think, they were offering a \"Generous Cut\" Porterhouse on the menu as well.....that might have been size of.....two cows (40-50 ounces per what our waiter quoted)  The sides were just as delightful.  Served family style, the Asparagus was grilled perfectly, the potato fingerlings roasted with a beautiful blend of butter and garlic, and the mushroom medley was bursting with flavor.  I will also add that the dinner rolls are probably some of the best I've ever had.  Soft and fresh hot out of the oven, they had a nice sweetness to them and the fresh churned butter added an exquisite country taste as well.  Dessert consisted of an excellent bread pudding with a scoop or Oreo ice cream, along with a Banana Fosters cream pie.  Both were amazingly good.  I have no idea how we stomached them, but they were a nice finishing touch.  The wine list is extensive and amazing.  They're one of the few restaurants in Vegas that serve one of my favorite wineries wine (Neal).  We had an absolutely dazzling bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon, that we had to order another.  Needless to say, both gentleman slugged down 75% of a bottle each.  : )  The service was excellent.  our waiter was attentive at all times and was very alert to our needs.  The best waiters are those that know what you want without even having to signal or tell them, and our waiter was just that good.  A very elegant setting and located in the walkway connecting the Palazo and Venetian, this is definitely one of the steakhouses in Vegas I will frequent again.",

The 1st time I ordered the bone-in-ribeye and was disappointed because it had some gristle and was underwhelming to say the least. On this trip, the wife had the organic baby mixed greens salad and the Filet while I had the shrimp cocktail and once again the bone-in-ribeye. We also shared an order of asparagus.  The Filet was good - tender and nicely seasoned. My ribeye was disappointing, however. It was not very tender and didn't have much flavor for being dry-aged 2-3 weeks as per our waiter.  The service and atmosphere are on par with most of the other high-end steakhouses in Vegas, but the steaks are not as good as those we have had at Craftsteak, Cut, N9ne, Stripsteak, Prime, or even STK. Does not deserve more than 3 stars IMO and even though it wasn't bad, it is not good enough for us to return especially with all the other choices in town.",

Both steaks were absolutely delicious and cooked to perfection. The server was extremely knowledgeable about the menu . For the desert we opted to share the bread pudding,and I have to say it is one of the best I have ever eaten. Very good experience overall!",

    "text": "We came here for my husbands birthday dinner.  We were a few minutes early so had drinks in the lounge, A Tale Of Two Cherries and Louisiana Hard Tea.  Drinks were good and packed a punch.  We started with Barbecue Shrimp and Fried Green Tomatoes.  Barbecue shrimp was the same as at Emeril's other restaurants.  Delicious.  I only wish you got more then 4 shrimp and 1 tiny biscuit.  The fried green tomatoes were one of the nights specials.  They were topped with lump crap and fried light and crisp.  For our Entrees I got Emeril's Barbecue Salmon, he got Bone In Ribeye.  We chose Twiced Baked Potato and Grits for our sides.  Salmon and steak were both wonderful and cooked perfectly.  The sides were creamy and rich, but very similar in flavor.  We loved them both but probably should have order something with more variety.  We finished with Banana Cream Pie and Caramel Butter Cake for dessert.  The Banana Cream Pie is Emeril's signature dessert that is served in all his restaurants.  Hubby loves it and it's a must order for us.  It was our first time ordering the Caramel Butter Cake and it didn't disappoint.  It was served warm and covered in gooey caramel.  Service started off slow, but got better as the meal went on.  We had incorrect charges on our bill that were quickly corrected when we brought it to our servers attention.",

We shared the seafood platter for an appetizer and how can you go wrong with king crab, oysters, and lobster.  I ordered the gumbo and it was delicious and full of depth and flavor.  The star of this dinner was the bone in Ribeye!  Perfectly charred on the outside and so tender and moist in the inside.  Best piece of steak I have had in my life, so far. Lol  I'm not a fan of fat on steak but the fat on this steak melted in my mouth and was as close to steak butter as there is.  My friends ordered sides but the steak was so big I didn't have room for anything else.  I think we ordered to much food and we had lots of leftovers. I could have shared the steak and I would have felt perfect.  This place is expensive but worth every penny.  If you feel like treating yourself this is a great place to eat.",

The crab legs were cut in half for you so it's easy to eat. The crabs were not as sweet this time. If seafood is your main course I would recommend Aquanox.   We had the wagyu ribeye for our main. It came with roasted grape tomatoes and maitake mushrooms. The ribeye was delicious. Very high fat content so I would recommend cooking it medium. It helps the fat meld with the meat.   For dessert we had the duck egg creme brulee. It was decadent and not too sweet.   Since it was a special birthday. The birthday girl received a complimentary mango sherbet with a lit candle and happy birthday written in chocolate.   Service: The service was good. Mark, Tyke, and Dan took care of us while we were there. Dan also wished the birthday girl happy 21st. While it was her ninth 21st birthday. =)",

My Chilean sea bass was okay, but again, not fabulous. My husband's rib eye was below average at best, I've cooked better at home. The twice baked potato was ok, but the shell was dry and hard. The dessert special was cheesecake, which was fine, but the banana cream pie was again, nothing to brag about. At this price point, too many other fine choices to bother with this place again.",

They only had a lunch special, but there was a lot of variety, and the food was great! Service was top notch as well, with our glasses never hitting halfway with a smile.  Had to hit it with the 4 star, since some of the food was hit and some miss, but overall everything was good and a great value for RW.  Started off with a surprise amuse!  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/delmonico-steakhouse-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#s2aCXocbqLcx3v6sl0_NZw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/delm...</a>  Then the apps came out...The Heirloom Tomato Soup with Grilled Ricotta Cheese Sandwich was good!   <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/delmonico-steakhouse-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#ogoxihGvCtfmoq7L8TD1BA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/delm...</a>  The soup itself was a little rich and thick, not very soupy consistency, but it worked well with the delicious Ricotta Cheese sandwich! But I tried a few spoonfuls without the sandwich, and it didn't stand on its own.  Vine-Ripened Heirloom Tomato Salad :  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/delmonico-steakhouse-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#d9kt2ojPgUys4VgvTBOTOg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/delm...</a>  Consisted of Burrata Cheese, Red Onion, Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Balsamic Vinegar and Torn Local Basil.  The company liked it, but since I am not a fan of tomatoes, I didn't bother trying it.  On to the entrees!  The Grilled Skirt Steak Sandwich was great!  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/delmonico-steakhouse-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#EWRi7UESqNjHjvYn0GlXLQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/delm...</a>  It was on Ciabatta with Roasted Mushrooms & Onions, Horseradish Mayonnaise, Spinach and Truffle French Fries! The sandwich itself was great! The steak was a perfect and tender medium rare, with the horseradish mayo adding the perfect blend of awesome! The truffle fries were great as well, but their style of fries are a bit overcooked for my tastes. Seems like they are twice fried here...and everyone's was like this, so I know it wasn't by accident. Still good though!  Butternut Squash Ravioli :  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/delmonico-steakhouse-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#GQE0e9w2Ew-u0GzjA1SJjQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/delm...</a>  Consisted of Sage Brown Butter, Toasted Hazelnuts and Parmesan Cheese. Not bad...very creamy though.  The desserts were awesome! Emeril's Banana Cream Pie :  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/delmonico-steakhouse-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#EZOm9VBP7nhTaoF6PABi-A\">yelp.com/biz_photos/delm...</a>  Had a Caramel Sauce, Chocolate Shavings and Whipped Cream, and it was way to big to finish! Lots of chunks of banana, and the cream pie portion was rich and outstanding.   The Pecan Pie :  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/delmonico-steakhouse-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#2PfIwfb5F0JTL9DuO52Wyw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/delm...</a>  Had an Oatmeal Shortbread Crust, French Vanilla Ice Cream & Caramel Sauce. It was good too! A bit better on the portion control here lol.  Anyways, I want to make it back to check out their steak menu! Seems like they are a little less spendy than some of the others on the strip, with prices on aged beef starting in the high $40s.",

The chips were very good ; and the liquor and wine lists are some of the most complete anywhere .    The servers behind the bar were attentive but it was REALLY obvious that they have a slight touch of  animosity toward the guests.  Perhaps here in Las Vegas the guests are a bit abusive , that may account for the latent attitude .  Mind you , they don't display it to your face , but if You keep your ears and eyes open ,  you can easily pick up on the glares and hushed cross talk between them .  Given the world as it is though , can anyone expect them to be anything but a little jaded?  All in all , 4 stars",

The rolls were delicious, as they are in all of Emeril's restaurants.  Ordered the Lobster Bisque soup, which was incredible.  The large pieces of lobster inside the soup just made it all that much better.  I ordered the bone-in ribeye and my wife ordered the filet.  Both steaks were cooked perfectly and were extremely tender.  We also enjoyed the twice baked potato with our meal.  For dessert, we had to have the Banana Cream Pie.  It was absolutely fabulous.  It had chocolate shavings drizzled on top and caramel sauce on the plate.  This is not your ordinary piece of pie.  It was absolutely heaven.  We had a fantastic meal, just like we have at Emeril's other restaurants.  The service was excellent and the staff was very friendly.",

The Apex and Sema Convention were on town so the restaurant was packed. I had a ribeye steak which was good however the baked potato I ordered was cold along with our other sides. I will give credit to the manager who did remove the sides from our bill.  The bone marrow toast did not taste like it had any bone marrow at all and the BBQ shrimp was just ok.    I was very disappointed especially after spending  $388   I wasn't aware the convention was in town or we definitely would have come another night. when your spending that much money on a steak I think the service and meal should be outstanding",

It was great from the time that they called to confirm our reservations all the way through the goodbyes from the staff. I am a New Orleans native and I like to try our out of town restaurants whenever I get a chance. The service was impeccable. The food was magnificent. My brother who is a super picky eater ordered the rabbit and I am not kidding, he literally cleaned his plate! Everyone, loved their food. The prices were very relevant to what we received. Best of all they let us bring in my mother's bday cake with no problem. I was proud to say the least that this was an Emeril's restaurant which originated in NOLA!! Thank you Emeril for picking such a wonderful team to represent you and New Orleans!  P.S. Thank you chef Ronnie for the spectacular food...that picky brother of mine, his name is Ronnie too!",

I decided since I'd had such great experiences at Emeril's restaurants in New Orleans that I would likely be impressed by Delmonico in Las Vegas and I absolutely was. We started with the BBQ shrimp, we each had the bone in ribeye, we shared a twice baked potato, the corn gratinee and finally the churro. Everything was absolutely delicious. My ribeye was hands down the most perfectly cooked steak I have ever had. It was tender, flavorful, juicy and had the perfect amount of char on the outside. I would absolutely choose Delmonico again when looking for a steakhouse in Vegas.",

I dined here with my husband on a late Friday night.  The food here was just \"OK\". My breakdown of each dish is this:  The Popovers: meh..they were ok. I think they were over cooked which made them a bit too dry and with a slightly burnt butter taste. I like Tyler Florence does a better version at Wayfare Tavern (SF).  Appetizer special - Pappardelle w/ Crimini Mushrooms in a white wine sauce finished with parmigiana: Good stuff. Very light and tasty pasta, too many mushrooms for my liking, I would've preferred more pasta. Very small tasting plate so don't expect to get more than 3 or 4 bites.  Creamed spinach: Another meh dish. I wanted more flavor here. Maybe a finish with butter would've helped. Some seasoning or something. Literally all I could taste was watery spinach.  Twice Baled loaded Potatoes: YESSSSSS PLEASE! Now this was a great dish. Flavor in every bite. Perfect partner for my steak.  Ribeye Steak (w/o bone) OSCAR STYLE w/ Jumbo Lump Crab Meat, Grilled Asparagus and Bearnaise.- I SOOOOOO wanted to love this steak. I really did. Order a my steak cooked medium and unfortunately it came out damn near rare. Like literally just short of bleeding. There was hardly any flavor.  The best part was the burnt edges as they actually added some flavor. I'd give my steak a 2/5, however, the Jumbo Lump crab and Bearnaise WAS THE BOMB!  Smoked Pork chop: my husband truly enjoyed his pork chop. Tender with a smokey flavor all the way thru. The pork chop was huge! I'm not a big pork chop eater, but it was tasty.   Pecan pie: Now this was worth the price of admission. A tasty warm & nutty pie with cold delicious ice cream. Mmmmm mmmmm good. I'd come here again just to eat this. A MUST have if you're ordering desserts.  As previously mentioned in other reviews, the wine here is definitely over priced. I understand the mark ups restaurants need to make, but I think Delmonico's takes the \"upcharge\" to an entirely new level. We ordered a bottle of Kim Crawford's Sauvignon Blanc, which retails for about $18-20, we were charged $45 for the bottle!!! Talk about a rip off! Outside of opening the bottle and pouring the wine, what constitutes a $25 mark up?  Needless to say I most likely won't return here. I'm glad I tried it, but I don't think it was worth the price tag. I'd prefer to go back to Mario Batali's B&B, which is located directly across the walk way from Delmonico's.",

The filet minion which they used to do perfectly and second to none now usually comes out either overcooked or undercooked.   The Caesar salad we loved is now a 50/50 shot.   Finally and most disappointing is the $130 seafood tower which is probably the least value I've ever seen. Lobster tails where the meat sticks to the shell and a tuna cup which was really bad.   They still make the best vanilla ice cream. That's something. :)",

We were 20 minutes late for our 8:30pm reservation since we were stuck trying to squeeze through the NYE crowd from 2 hotels down.  The host didn't think anything of it and was able to seat us right away.  I had ordered the filet mignon and shared the side of the perfectly steamed and buttered asparagus that could serve up to 4 people.  I ordered my filet medium rare and it was definitely medium rare as our helpful and attentive waiter, Ryan, had described it.  The other dishes my dining companions had were the pepper-seared ahi tuna, grilled petite beef medallions, and spicy jumbo shrimp with fresh fettucine pasta.  All of which they loved.    The dessert lovers shared the warm apple crisp and the chocolate brioche bread pudding.  It was the first chocolate bread pudding I had and once I dug into the soft center, I fell in love....  At the end of dinner, not having a calculator, Ryan noticed I was struggling a bit to calculate everyone's portion of the bill and he kindly offered to split the bill 6 ways as I had specified to make things easier.... How nice was that?!  Excellent food, excellent service - highly recommend dining here.",

I think a little is lost if you forget Chef Emeril's philosophy; watch him on TV, the guy just likes good food.  Remember Erik, you didn't eat at Bouchon or French Laundry... you didn't go on a magical food adventure.  You had a steak.  A damned good steak.  The ambiance is nice; dimly-lit, full-service, white-linen business casual kind of place.  The wife and I had good, attentive service, and our head waiter was a treat.  He was incredibly accommodating and helpful.  I had fun listening to him give the table next to us tips on eating in Vegas, steering that couple away from Tao (\"A nightclub that happens to serve food.\") and Cut (\"Way too salty and LA pretentious for my taste.  Maybe they've toned it down... the salt, anyway.\")  We started out with two appetizers, as we usually do, our favorite Emeril's New Orleans BBQ shrimp with petite rosemary biscuit, and to get into the steakhouse mood, the wonderful truffle and parmesan potato chips.  My wife had the filet mignon medallions crusted in mushrooms with a pan sauce, don't remember of what, and I had the 9 oz. filet mignon with a small pad of maitre'd butter, cooked to a warm, pink, bloody center.  Both were EXCELLENT.  For dessert, we capped our meal, and ourselves off with Emeril's banana cream pie and the pecan pie.  I had a single jamaican blue mountain courtesy of cafes richard.    The food was excellent, service was spot-on, and atmosphere was great, if a tad noisy.  Unfortunately, the authentic Kobe filet I had at Fish House spoiled me on steaks forever, so as good as Delmonico is, I can only muster 4 stars.",

    "text": "Another large group dinner with the co-workers, this time we selected Delmonico Steakhouse.  Wow, I am impressed.  This is what I call classy.  I didn't even realize this was an Emeril Lagasse restaurant until I examined the doggie bag afterward!  The food is top notch, I ordered the butternut squash ravioli (sans duck confit) and the wild arugula w/ raspberries.  Both dishes were just the right size (not too big, not too small), beautifully presented, perfectly seasoned and dressed, and absolutely delicious.  We ordered and shared the green apple crisp a la mode for dessert, I might have loved it more if I was still hungry, but I was so stuffed that I couldn't properly enjoy it.  Note to self: next time, dessert first!  Literally, there was not a single bite leftover from anyone's plate.  In regards to the service, our server Jen was such a sweetheart, she seemed like a friend right from the start.  Not too intrusive, but relaxed and attentive.  Very accommodating and down to earth.  Must try items: Homemade potato chips with parmesan, truffle oil and scallions.  I was stuffing my face like no tomorrow and scraping the plate clean...The warm dinner rolls w/ butter...They smelled SO buttery!  Lastly, the corn gratin, the panko topping was so crispy, it was unreal, the gratin underneath was hot, steamy, and sweet from the crisp fresh corn.  SOOO GOOOD!  All in all, this place was expensive, but none of the staff had to overdo it to impress us, the atmosphere, food and service spoke for itself, so it was worth every penny.  LOVE",

    "text": "Excellent, excellent service. That is the one thing I remember about this restaurant. Everyone who served my party of 4 was so professional from start to finish. The head waiter gave us great recommendations on what steak to select, and which wine would go well with it. I was amazed at all of the little details including refolding my table cloth while I was away at the restroom.  The food was 5/5 - all of us ordered a medium-rare bone-in ribeye. It was the biggest and juiciest steak I've ever had. Quite unfortunate that I was not able to finish the last third, the serving was that large. Yes, the check for 4 people ended up being several hundred dollars but it was worth every single cent for the dining experience.",

    "text": "3 stars for the wine list.   2 for the steak.  I've gotta say that the service and ambiance was astounding given they let me bring my 3 foot tall yard full of long island ice tea, from the flamingo no less, to the table.  Greater than that? the wait staff were kind enough to fill it up with ice for me as I left it sitting there, as our center piece.    The wine list was insane.  It must have been 50 pages.  In the end we ended up going with something simple because we were already pretty hammered from our fun in the sun.  The appetizers were decent from what I remember, but the anti-pasto salad looked like cold cuts from my mom's fridge.  It just wasn't presented well for the type of clout this place assumes.  So here I am, dining Euro style waiting 2 hours for the steak to finally arrive, chewing on my day old bologna and it finally arrives...  ...and it sucks!  I got the bone in rib-eye, one of my favorite cuts, and it was \"toasted\" excessively and really lacked any distinguishable flavor!  I couldn't believe that i was paying this kind of money for a steak I was making in my BBQ baby years.  And you know how sometimes things taste so, so good when you're trashed?  I couldn't imagine my feelings had I been sober.    But I'm not so sure it was all bad - my friends had some pretty good Filet, and the soup was good from what I understand.  It's just not going to be MY first choice for a favorite dining spot in Vegas.  Like I said though, the wait staff was great, the wine list amazing, and the silverware clean.    Emeril - try again... and for you readers - try The Mesa Grill instead...",

    "text": "We were at DelMonico's last year to celebrate my boyfriend's sister's 21st birthday. That meant there were A LOT of us! The atmosphere was awesome, but then again, every restaurant in Vegas has some degree of nice ambiance, right? Anyhow, our large party wasn't able to sit together, which really sucked because we had made reservations and they expected all of us at that time. So, my boyfriend, me and his two cousins got our own mini-table. We all shared the caesar salad prepared table-side. It was seriously enough for all 4 of us, and it was very very delicious. I ordered the gumbo, and was very disappointed. I thought that gumbo would be Emeril's thing! It was slightly cold and WAY too salty. It was a nice little presentation though-- it came in a mini-pot and was poured into my bowl.   I had the filet mignon and it was okay, and I wish I had ordered the duck. I can't really say why I only thought the filet mignon was only okay, but maybe it had to do with the fact that it was pretty salty too and I had just finished up a super salty gumbo?   All in all, it was a fun experience because of the atmosphere and because all of the family was there. Would we have had just a good of a time had we gone somewhere else? Probably. But, this was birthday girl's choice and it was kinda fun to go to a celebrity chef's place and criticize their food. :)",

    "text": "It was a good restaurant but I wouldn't tell a friend \"you have to try this place!\"   I didn't want to order a whole steak for myself because I was on a diet at the time so I decided to share one with my sister. This was a bad decision. If I have never been able to get along with her, what made me think we can share a steak. This was apparent after she ordered it \"medium well\" and I shot her a look and remark of \"I don't want mine medium well, I want it medium rare\" This minor conflict turned uncomfortable for the rest of my family as her and I debated over how our steak should be cooked. (My theory - anything over medium kills the good juicy flavor) All the while the waitress was standing there, listening to us go back and forth about the steak. I don't remember how it ended up being cooked, but I do remember the steak coming out cut in half. Thanks waitress.   The food was good, I think everyone was pretty content with what they ordered. I don't think any of us thought it was the greatest meal ever, but it worked and we were satisfied. Service was nice, patient, and attentive.",

    "text": "As part of a birthday celebration weekend for two of my cousins, a group of us decided to head to Delmonico Steakhouse for a really nice birthday dinner. We had no idea what to expect of this place, except for the high prices.   We were running late for our reservation, but we called the restaurant letting them know we were on our way. It was a group of 6, so we really did not want to loose our reservation. They could not have been any more helpful over the phone! Directions were provided, and they kindly held our table until we arrived.  Upon arrival, we were quickly escorted to our table. Our server kindly welcomed us and wished my two cousins a very happy birthday and memorable meal. After we all ordered our entrees, we were pleasantly surprised with complimentary appetizers for the entire group (halibut ceviche which was to die for!!). Their bread rolls were extremely delicious and always kept coming. Water was always replenished without even asking. Always a step ahead those people! When it came time to receiving our entrees, the wait staff made sure that all our orders were correct before setting them on the table. The dinner was then completed with complimentary sorbet (made in house). Everything was delicious!!! No one had any complaints about anything.  The service was excellent; above and beyond my expectations of any restaurant. I have been to other restaurants like Delmonico's at The Venetian for birthday celebrations, and none match the superb service and attention of Delmonico. Despite the fact that the restaurant's prices are high, the overall experience, taste of the food, and service make it an exceptional place for any occasion.",

    "text": "Went to Emril's Delmonico last night for dinner and to sum up the experience was grossly underwhelmed from start to finish.  Atmosphere: the general atmosphere and ambiance is exactly what you'd expect from a fine-dining Casino restaurant. Clean and well-kept.   Service: The service was generally pretty good from the two support staff assisting our primary server. Our main server, however, was quite underwhelming to say the least. It was apparent from the moment he greeted us that he wasn't enthused to have a 2 top sit down (at a table for 2 no less). I mentioned to the server that I was interested in an appetizer to share, but didn't want something so large as to prevent me from fully enjoying the steak I had decided on. He ignored my question for a suggestion. I've never had that happen, anywhere, let alone a fine-dining establishment. The worst part, however, came to the bill. To set the stage, we were seated adjacent to two other 2-top tables, one of which was behind us in the meal progression, the other who was ahead of us. Several moments after our dessert and after dinner-drinks were dropped off, our bill was placed on our table with the statement \"I'll take this as soon as you are ready.\" Interesting . . . I looked at the table next to us, who had already finished dessert and they did not have their bill yet. And on top of that, he failed to ask us if we wanted anything else, which had he asked, he would have realized that my wife would have liked more hot water for her tea. My wife was also thoroughly irritated with the fact that the bill was explicitly placed within my reach, and not hers. She made it a point to the server that she was the one who wished to pay.  Food: We were both completely and 100% underwhelmed with everything we ordered. I had the \"house special\" which was a dry aged, bone-in ribeye, reportedly seasoned with Emril's Essence. It was a good steak. Not great by any means, and most certainly not worth the $52 price tag. The flavor was mediocre (surprising since its purportedly dry-aged), and the cook highly inconsistent. It was ordered medium rare, and parts were rare, others were medium. Very disappointing and suggestive of an amateur grill chef. I'm quite content to pay that much and far more for a good steak, however, I expect to get what I pay for, and this was most certainly not it. I've had far superior steaks for less than 1/2 that price.  My wife ordered the snapper, and it was so overcooked that it was mostly inedible. Also had the mushroom side, which was generally pretty good.  The dessert, however, was quite good. The banana creme pie.  Perhaps we went on an off night, however, this experience coupled with the abundance of other restaurants on the strip, is enough for me to never return.",

    "text": "We wanted to catch a little Sunday Football while enjoying some great food. Our original plan was to spend Football Sunday at Lagasse's Stadium. But, we were greeted by a line of about 15 people waiting to get in.  Not too bad. But in the 20 mins we were there, the line never moved. \"Sports Bar\" or not, I should have known if it bears Emeril's name then a reservation should be made. So off we went to find a spot for football Sunday and came upon a sign at Delmonico announcing Sunday Football specials in the bar.  The bar was loaded with every liquor bottle imaginable and the menu... We'll it's Emeril Lagasse so enough said. We took a seat and ordered what turned out to be the best meal of our trip! My boyfriend and I ordered up a couple of cold beers, Truffled Parmesan Chips and Lobster Sliders to share. OH EM GEE!!  The Sliders were amazing! Nicely toasted roll filled with a creamy, perfectly seasoned lobster salad. No skimping on the lobster either. Nice, tender chunks and crisp pieces of celery for added crunch. Delish! The chips... We'll, we ordered another batch.. They were THAT good!  Crisp, crunchy, chips drizzled with truffle oil for that earthy yumminess and sprinkled with some tangy grated Parmesan. At halftime, we followed up with the Grilled Ricotta and Tomato Soup. Fantastic! Thick layer of creamy Ricotta and Basil between slices of buttered grilled toast. Not sure if the soup was intended for dipping but that's what we did! The soup was light and tangy -perfect for taking our ricotta sandwich for a dip!!  Meal was amazing & staff was friendly ( Michelle was super attentive). This isn't your Carlos and Charlie's or Senior Frogs so don't let the \"football specials\" fool you. You get what you pay for and you will definitely pay for what you get here! And it's worth it!!",

While we'd had to put up with snobby staff at Valentino, the wait staff at Delmonico was informed, helpful, friendly, and a lot of fun to interact with.  And THE FOOD !!!  Oh my word, our ribeye steak was so fabulous we couldn't wait to try it again and went back the very next day for more of the same.",

The atmosphere is quiet and sophisticated without being stuffy.  In fact, our wait staff team was a great combination of being knowledgeable and fun.  The wine list gave us an ample selection and we were not disappointed with our choices.  We treated ourselves to the rib eye steak and fillet meals with fingerling potato side.  It was wonderful - done as requested with amazing taste thanks to the way they prepare it.  We would have loved to try a dessert (the pictures looked wonderful) but were too full despite sharing the potato side dish.  Maybe next time, we'll split an entree, too so we have room for dessert.  Overall, the entire experience was a real treat.",

For apps, we got the BBQ shrimp (awesome) and the oysters. Both are highly recommended.  My husband got the lobster bisque and I got the heirloom tomato salad.. the tomato salad was $18. Was that ridiculous? Yes. Was it worth it? Also yes.   I got the filet medium done, and my husband got the bone-in rib eye medium rare. My steak was perfection.. my husbands was too medium.. The staff were quick to correct the error and apologetically brought him a new steak. Talk about wonderful service!   We shared grits (so yummy and I am NOT a grits girl), and the asparagus.   For dessert we sampled the banana cream pie.. like everything else we had, it was really special :)  Overall, this is a wonderful place to splurge! The service is accommodating and helpful.. the food is well worth the money, and the ambiance is great :)",

Portions are large, and prices still relatively expensive, but it just didn't sweep me off my feet like the first time.  But it still gets 4 stars. Folded napkins each time you leave your seat. All good.  And my sis will prob remember me eating the leftovers in the hotel room after the convert. Ahahaha.",

Servers were waiting around to cater to your needs, but not in that anxiety-inducing I'm watching over you way.  This was our vday pick and frankly i was glad they didn't have a fixed menu. Being at a steakhouse i felt obligated to get the steak! I was also very appreciative of the fact that I didn't have to eat mine drenched in butter. My ribeye had a very nice crust of charred creole seasoning, with a lovely red center. Those smashed potatoes could not have been any creamier! I love when they serve the potatoes in that little pot. Honey got the lamb and it was deliciously tender, it practically melted in my mouth.   Nothing out of the ordinary or spectacular, but a solid choice for date nite or a nice dinner out.",

No but I figured a guy like Emeril Lagasse would make sure his steakhouse served a nice steak.  The decor inside is nice and clean, not a whole lot going on.  The opposite of a Red Robin, say.  Service was duly attentive.  Caesar salad prepared table-side was a treat.    We went with cocktails over wine from the rather pricey and extensive wine list.  I didn't even eyeball the list personally.  But a generous portion of Bombay Sapphire satisfied nicely.    I went with a bone-in New York, medium-rare.  It was cooked expertly.  It had great texture and flavor, a nice creole seasoning rub on there but not too heavily applied.  The beef did the talking.  Or the mooing.  It was good.  Only ordered one side on account of a late lunch and we're not rich: mushrooms sauteed in butter.  I feared some pain old sauteed buttons would come out.  But I was rewarded.  A hearty mix of flavorful 'shrooms, like oyster and chantrelle and maybe porcini or shiitake came out.  Lovely.  And buttery.  and Garlicky.",

The waiting bar was okay but dead.  The seats are nice but some tables get way too close to each other.    The calamari was very disappointing.  The warm spinach salad was really tasty.  I had the BBQ samon - it was flavorful, tender, juicy and overpriced.  If I had to eat there again, I'd probably just get a steak of some sort.  On my own, I wouldn't go back.",

It is a bunch of exotic mushrooms seasoned and sauteed perfectly.  We also had the country smashed potatoes and the creamed spinach, both delicious.  Finished off with creme brulee which was decent.

    "text": "My family went here for Fathers Day at noon. The place had a very nice atmosphere. We sat two minutes after checking in.  Five minutes later, a waiter approached us and took our order for drinks. He introduced himself and another waitress. We got our drinks and ten to fifteen minutes later, a different waitress gave us bread.  A person in a suit then approached us to ask if we were ready to order. We replied, \"Yes\".  He then walked away instead of taking our order. I would assume that he is the manager.  A different waitress then approached us to Finally take our order.  This took more than half an hour from the time we sat down.  Sad thing was that the table behind us sat after we did and was already eating their appetizer before someone took our order.  Mind you, we sat before several customers and they were attended to first. Very very poor start of customer service.  I would think that this place would have excellent service consistently.  Another, I had black slacks on. I placed the napkin on my lap, and behold the napkin left tons of white lint on my black pants.  I went to other restaurants in Vegas and I was offered a black napkin to use instead.  Others, the napkin did not leave as much lint as this one did. I ordered the lobster bisque, which was excellent. Creamy, smooth, and a lot of flavor.  I also ordered the filet medallions.  It had panko breading which I really didn't care for.  The bacon was charred and hard, but the two filet medallions were great.  It also had a simple sauce with small mushrooms. My dad had the lobster sliders.  The sliders were surprisingly great according to my dad.  They didn't skimp on the lobster.  Instead of shredded pieces, they are a generous portion in the sliders.  The bread they offered got cold pretty quick but it was still good to eat.  At first, drinks were coming in slow. Then the waiters paid more attention to us in the end.  The restroom was located all the way in the very back.  I thought I had to exit the building itself to use the restroom.  You have to through a very long hallway to the very back towards the exit sign.  The sink was shallow and I could barely wash my hands in it since it's so shallow that my hands will get wet from the dirty water in the sink.  There was only one sink available.  Food would have been excellent.  Service was mediocre.  I'm not sure I would return here if I have this kind of service.  It was my first time here.",

    "text": "My experience at Delmonico Steakhouse was well-above average, but not as fantastic as I thought it would be.  First off, although we had made reservations well in advance, we had to wait over 20 minutes for our table.  All was not completely lost, however, since we passed the time in Delmonico's classy little, modish bar area where we got started on our red wine for the evening.   There was a bit of confusion amongst the servers shortly after we were seated, and we experienced a delay in receiving our selection of bottled waters for our table.  At Delmonico, they give you the option of choosing from a few types of bottled and mineral waters for an additional charge, or you can request just regular,complimentary tap water. After the initial delay, our water glasses were refilled continuously throughout the meal, however.   Like most five star restaurants, at Delmonico Steakhouse, you receive service from several members of the waitstaff, which ensures constant attention and most of your dining needs are met without even having to request anything.  The interior of the steakhouse was minimalist, with tables covered in cream colored linens and simple, modern brown leather chairs for seating. The space had a slightly Mediterranean feel due to its coved ceilings.  No doubt because the restaurant is located inside the Venetian Hotel, they wanted to maintain a slightly Italian theme througout.   The restaurant, which was was packed with patrons, was also very loud.  I think the coved ceilings were extremely conducive to the noise level contained in the dining room.  This combined with brighter than desired lighting, created a slightly less intimate dining experience than were were anticipating.    The food was very good, however.  We started with the crabcake, and it was tender, buttery and delicious.  Followed by that, were our iceberg wedge salads with bacon, blue cheese and all the yummies.  Hubby ordered the bone-in ribeye, and I ordered the bone-in NY strip, both were cooked to medium perfection.  For sides, we shared a huge, delicious baked potato with sour cream, bacon, green onions and cheddar. For dessert, we shared the caramel creme brulee, and it was very, very good.  Overall, we enjoyed our meal very much, and we would return here again for the food.  Our experience was just was not over-the-top fabulous because of the noise and lighting factors.",

The service was 'jonnie on the spot' with all levels of servers keeping a watchful eye on the table...perhaps too watchful!  Twice, as I looked around to check out the decor and the people, they came running over to assist.  Better to have False alarms then left waiting.  If the place has one issue, it's the atmosphere.  The design is plain white arched ceilings with rock wall and white light accents.  I respect how much they were able to achieve with just architecture and lights, but without the lights it might look a bit like a medieval dungeon.    All things considered, the food and service were about as good as it gets so go check it out!",

    "text": "I would give Delmonico a 2.5 or even more if it was available but as it's 2 or 3 unfortunately for them I have to go with 2. There were so many pluses for the meal that I feel bad about rating the restaurant low. However, the overall experience was not what I wanted, and for a  meal of this price I have pretty achievable expectations.  For starters, the sevice was immaculate and I mean truly immaculate, the servers work as a team and they we're amazing. From recommending wines to full descriptions of food, and even drinks, they were aces. The wine list had so many rare and amazing finds that you could get lost searching, thankfully the staff was able to help us pick out one perfect for our tastes and meal. For the appetizer, bone in bacon, we'll if you didn't think it would be absolutely amazing by the name I can promise you, words do not describe how amazing this appetizer is. It truly is memorizing. Try it, and you'll understand.   For dinner I had a filet and he had a bone in ribeye, their signature cut. Unfortunately  my husband had to send his steak back due to being substantially overlooked. Again, the waitstaff immediately addressed the issue and apologized agreeing with my husband that not only was the steak overlooked, but it was substantially overlooked, ie, the steak was ordered medium rare and came out between medium well and well.  The waitstaff removed the steak from the table and after a few minutes brought my husband a second steak, most notable on the second steak was the fact that the steak butter was not melted, leading us to believe that the  steak was brought directly from the grill to the table, no time to rest under a lamp and overcook itself, a plus we thought. Until my husband cut into the second ribeye, again their signature steak, again substantially overlooked. At this point the server, who was speaking with my husband about the meal and appologizing about the previous steak appeared appalled that again, the steak was substantially overdone. He appeared embarrassed for the issues. We were promised no matter what it would be made up for and even the manager immediately addressed my husband and appeared completely appalled that the steak was so overdone, for a second time, (this time closer to medium well, maybe a high medium, but still nowhere near medium rare.)   The manager and server traded apologies and promised to make things right. Due to the fact that I had only had half of my filet, my husband opted to not receive another ribeye, instead choosing to just finish my meal. The server and manager happily took the ribeye off and purchased us two desserts for the troubles and issues.   For the good, the menu is amazing. In it's entirety, I believe it rivals some of the best steakhouses around. The lobster bisque is by far the best I've had, and as a fan of lobster bisque, I've had it at several 4 and 5 star restaurants all over the United States. Presentation, flavor, texture, everything was amazing.   The bone in bacon, if I didn't convince you before, it is one of the most flavorful dishes I have ever had, the watermelon is a little strange sounding but brings out so much flavor that again, I just can't put it into words, you have to experience this dish!  My filet oscar was great, perfectly cooked, very flavorful and perfectly seasoned. I just wish I had a second stomach to finish it after almost licking the plate of lobster bisque and bone in bacon.   Desserts were great as everything else, and the after dinner drink list is as expansive as the wine list. If you can imagine it, they have it.   My only issue is my husbands meal, again I feel bad because I understand mistakes happen, but it was very unfortuonate that for a dinner to celebrate our first annivarsary, at the end he/we were disappointed. He continued to describe it as \"the food was amazing, but not what I was hoping for.\"   I personally have issues with a $300 meal (granted $130 of it being an amazing and perfectly reccomended bottle of wine,) being disappointing in any way. Again mistakes happen and I believe firmly that they are rare at Delmonicos, but I cannot change this disappointing experience.   If this is the only negative review that you read please do not discount this restaurant. Again, mistakes happen, and even as I write this, I feel bad for not giving the restaurant better ratings because so many things were good and accidents happen, but it doesn't change the experience tonight. Hopefully, as it appeared, this will be a rare experience and we may give this restaurant another shot the next time we're in Vegas, but as this was supposed to be a special meal celebrating, I will say disappointing is the best way to describe it. The restaurant has so much more potential and obviously could have done so much better than we experienced, we were just unlucky. Again, no fault on the waitstaff, they were amazing, but overall experience was disappointing. I hope others have better luck than we did.",

The drinks are some of the best on the strip, the Lobster Bisque and locally grown tomato salad ( yep a greenhouse in Vegas and the cheese made in house)  is to die for, and everyone that had steak said it was full of flavor and cooked perfectly. I had the Salmon special and it was great as their fish dishes always are.  Until last week I was never a fan of Key Lime pie- but when we got several desserts for the table the Key Lime pie was one of them.. and although I went in with hesitation... it was hands down the best dessert on the table...so the new rule for me is Key Lime Pie- but only at Delmonico!  As all things with the Emeril name impeccable service was our experience - even with a trade show crowd and a large private whiskey tasting event. Our water glasses were never less than 2/3 full, a server was always there for another drink or any issue. The pace of our meal was first rate. I'll be back again next year!",

Started with delicious Krug champagne and oysters. I really appreciated quality oysters after having some sub-par ones the night before at a buffet.   My boyfriend ordered the lobster bisque and I should have too. I ended up having a bit of his, it is NOT to be missed. We almost put in another order.   I ordered the filet and he the bone-in ribeye. Both were delicious, and even though they are famous for the ribeye I liked the filet more. It was so lean and tender, cooked perfectly medium rare, but it was that charring on the outside that gave it this incredible flavor. The ribeye was fantastic too, it had a completely different flavor. My man preferred his ribeye so it worked perfectly. Honestly can't say a bad thing about either.   They sent us a house mad sherbet to celebrate our engagement, and we finished with divine espresso.   My fiance and I agree this was the most delicious and flawless meal we have shared. We will definitely return every time we come to Vegas.",

I've gone to the lounge seating area just to indulge in a slice of their Banana Cream Pie, so if you love pie, and BCP, then you've got to find the time and make room for this...",

I ordered a little side of horseradish on the side and the two went very well together.  The steak fries were great also.  The staff was great and took very good care of us.  It's a tad bit loud and the ambiance isn't great.  But if you want a good steak, you'd be hard pressed to find a better one than Delmonico's serves.",

The restaurant had plenty of seats and we were seated right away as we walked in. We shared a salad and a side of sauteed mushrooms, I had their filet mignon, and boyfriend had the ribeye. EVERYTHING including the mushrooms were memorable, and we weren't even that hungry when we walked in. I wish Emeril would open one in San Francisco, so we can go back on our special occasions more conveniently.",

    "text": "This is has been on my list for a while, so it was one of my first choices for Spring Restaurant Week this year. I came here for lunch during the week with fellow Yelpers and we took advantage of their $30.14 prie fixe menu (Three Square $4 donation). I also utilized Open Table to make my reservation.  The three of us started with the Vine-Ripened Heirloom Tomato Salad for our appetizer. The fresh heirloom tomatoes (2-3 different types/colors) were served with a dollop of creamy Burrata cheese, red onion, extra virgin olive oil, balsamic vinegar, and fresh local basil. Really crisp and refreshing; great start to our meal.  For the entree, I selected the Delmonico's Prime Hamburger served on a toasted brioche roll with cheddar cheese, crispy bacon, and the usual fixings (lettuce, tomato, onion). It was perfectly medium rare with juices oozing out with every squeeze. The burger had great flavor and seasoning, so that made it stand out from other burgers I've had. It was also an extremely generous portion. I could barely finish half of it (and I eat A LOT). My only complaint was that although the burger started out juicy and delicious, it dried out really quickly and made it almost difficult to eat. I'm not sure what attributed to this, but it was odd. The fries were delicious! A unique preparation of crispiness.  I also had the opportunity to taste the Butternut Squash Ravioli prepared with sage brown butter, toasted hazelnuts, and parmesan cheese and Pan Roasted Atlantic Salmon served with a sweet corn and crab vinaigrette and fresh basil. Both were really delicious! The salmon was so soft with a succulent rareness in the center of the filet. I was also really impressed with the large chunks of crab meat and whole kernels of corn.  For dessert, I opted for the White Chocolate Macadamia Nut Bread Pudding with Vanilla Bean Creme Anglaise. I'm glad someone else chose Emeril's Banana Cream Pie because it was a tough decision for me (both being my favorite desserts). The bread pudding was moist, warm, and very yummy. The pecan caramel-like sauce was a bit sweet, but fortunately, the pudding was not. The banana cream pie was topped with caramel sauce, chocolate shavings, and whipped cream. Yum. It was good, but I'll have to order one in the future to get a really good taste of it.  The restaurant is nice and I like the dimly lit rooms with spotlights on each table. It wasn't very busy during our meal, but I'm sure it would still be that nice and quiet. The service was also phenomenal. I was extremely pleased with the offering of Harney & Sons tea (transported in the most gorgeous wooden box display) and the fact that it was complimentary. Everyone was so prompt to refill my pot with hot water and of course, it was served with fresh lemon and honey. We also stayed past their lunch service and they were so kind to allow us to loiter for that long.",

To start, we got the seafood tower- lobster, oysters, shrimp, crab legs, tuna tartare YUM. All the seafood came on ice so I would recommend that you let it sit on your plate a couple minutes before eating. We also got the bone in rib eye which was cooked to perfection and huge! The chocolate cake and pistachio ice cream was a great way to end the meal. Definitely a pricey steakhouse but worth every dollar.",

    "text": "Unbelievable. Delmonico's was an unforgettable experience from start to finish.  We went there with a group of six to celebrate a 30th birthday. We called two days in advance to make a reservation (you can do it on their website too).    We arrived and were seated immediately and it was then that I realized that it would be a dining experience. We had 4-5 servers around out table at any given time. We were immediately served water, delicious little bread knots, and out drink orders were taken. I thought it was interesting that they did not give a drink menu, rather the server recited all drinks in the given category to each person (wines: red or white, beers: IPA or Stout etc). Then they reviewed the menu with us and took our orders. There were many specials available, and they brought us a sample of a cheese tomato pesto flat bread, on the house.   The meal took a good 20 minutes, but it was worth every second (and dollar!). I had a filet, which was prepared to perfection. Sides are a la carte, and family style. The green beans, potatos au gratin, and country smashed potatoes were to die for. Very very delicious.  This is hard to imagine, but the servers were almost too hovering. They filled your water after one or two sips. They definitely took care of us to any need. The prices are high, but worth it. Delmonico's is something I will always remember about Vegas.",

    "text": "One of my favorite dishes is Rack of Lamb.  When I'm traveling for work and see it on the menu, I have to try it.  My bar of measure is Mr. B's in New Orleans French Quarter part of the Brennan family.  Short of flying to Paris to find a fair place to compete against Mr. B's grilled lamb chops, Delmonico's certainly gave Mr. B's a run for its money.  I tried Delmonico's without looking at yelp first - in some countries I would be shot for this crime - and not knowing that Delmonico's even existed.  It was after a long day of work and simply being hungry, I walked into the first restaurant that was open without even looking at the menu.  When I was seated and handed the wine list, I knew I had found the right place, almost by divine inspiration.  The wine list was more like a wine book, only dedicating the last page to single glass selections.  The rest were bottles only.  This is where I figured out I was in a place worthy of my pallet.  They had 15 different vintages of Caymus Special Reserve.  Most fine dining places maybe have one or two at most.  Of course since the company was paying and no one to split a bottle, I could not in good conscious order a bottle.  I would have been hung by the accounting department.  The waiter gave the specials of the day and I of coursed b-lined for the lamb chops like a rabid dog.  When the dish arrived you could smell the fine attention to detail that the chef had prepared.  The Colorado rack of lamb with Roasted Cipollini Onions, Haricot Vert and Brandy Peppercorn Reduction staring back at me was love at first sight.   I order my rack of lamb medium rare. Anything else would be blasphemous to the animal who sacrificed itself for my dining pleasure.  The lamb was tender and juicy all the way through.  The vegetables, especially the Cipollini onions soaked in the tender juices of the lamb melted in my mouth.  This was a meal that reminded me why it's so good to be alive.  My only regret and no fault to Delomico's is I broke and tried the bread pudding for desert.  Being an Emeril restaurant I figured why not.  Being a bread pudding connoisseur and having such a spectacular experience with the lamb, I had high expectations.  I will be fair and say I was offered the key lime pie instead but I stayed True to course and ordered the bread pudding.  Was it bad? No but it was certainly average for the area and if placed in New Orleans, it wouldn't even register on the map.  Delmonico's is marketed as \"creole\" restaurant and as such looses a star for the poor attempt on their bread pudding.    Will I be back? Absolutely without a doubt! Will I be ordering the bread pudding? No and if have a hankering for bread pudding after your meal at Delmonico's, mosey yourself on down to Gordon Ramsey's Pub and Grill.  Order the spotted dog and you will be in bread pudding heaven.  With that said, Delmoico's is in my top three restaurants of all time in Las Vegas.  If you don't mind spending a pretty penny on dinner and you're a True fan of food, Delmonico's is hands down one of the finest restaurants in Las Vegas.",

The cut itself had much thicker sections of fat than any ribeye I have ever ordered.  After removing most of the carbonized surface, I finally was able to try the meat below.  It tasted like a regular steak.  Not prime, and it lacked the tang of an aged steak.  They told me it was wet aged 3 weeks and dry aged 4 weeks.  I find this hard to believe.  The service was quite excellent and the only reason they are getting 2 stars.  That's twice now I've felt cheated dining at prime steakhouses on the strip.",

But the FOOOOOOD alone deserves 5 stars:  Tuna & Salmon Tartare - very fresh tuna & salmon tartare, each delicately seasoned, with a bit of wasabi sauce & seaweed salad in between.  A lightly dressed cucumber and red onion salad with the tiniest seasame seeds sprinkled on top added a nice vinegary element.  And crunchy wonton chips were perfect to scoop up everything with.  Great texture & flavor!  Bone In Ribeye - a seared perfectly, served medium rare, herb butter topped, giant steak.  Classic.  Awesome.  Applewood Smoked Double Cut Kurobuta Ham Chop - I'm not a big fan of pork so if I say that I loved this, it's a BIG deal.  This double cut chop had seared, caramelized, fatty edges, and was perfectly seasoned.  This was THE juiciest pork chop I've ever had.  Served with pecan-topped, candied sweet potatoes that are a MUST eat with the chop, & a cider reduction.  The combination of savory, sweet, buttery, meaty, pecan-y, brown sugary, and slightly hammy flavors together were amazing.  Emeril knows his pork!  Wild Mushrooms - a generous mess of delicious mixed mushrooms.  Yes.  Banana Cream Pie - a ridiculously impressive-looking presentation, crazy tall!  Thin & slightly salty crispy graham crust, tons of freshly sliced bananas, able to reach such heights because the pudding was more cheesecake-y texture & acted as banana mortar.  Topped with fresh whipped cream, a drizzle of caramel, & a few chocolate shavings.  You'd have to be crazy to attempt to eat this alone!  This was definitely a dinner to remember, and that ham chop is something to spread the word about.  Get it!",

There may be a wait if you have not made reservations so make sure to call ahead and reserve a corner table (for people watching of course). - Not for the food.  The service was great! If my review were only for the service this would be an easy 5 star rating. There are two main servers, plus water, and wine servers as well. I always love this added touch because it makes for better service.   Now to the real rating. The FOOD (insert dramatic music in background).   Let's just say the bill came out to roughly $300 and we were not the least bit impressed.  The only notable item was the wine which was delicious, very smooth, a quaint merlot to go well with our steaks..  That was about it though.  The mashed potatoes were too globby,  the mushrooms were simply made in a butter sauce that tasted, well, tasted buttery.  There was no essence action and considering this steakhouse is a reflection of Emeril- I'm not impressed. Where's the flavor Emeri?!?  My steak was ordered medium - my steak came out well done and tough. There were no add ons to compliment the steak, perhaps a dry rub, a sauce maybe? I asked for lemon to zest my steak, considering I still had every intention of eating it  (Yes, hunger is real when you're in Vegas on the weekend).. but what disappointed me the most were the cocktail lemon wedges which I received from our server..  It was more of an, \"Are you kidding me? Delmonico cannot afford to add simple cheesecloth, or a gauze socks around half lemons and here I am cashing out 300 bucks!?\"  I try my best to give each business the best reflection possible, but in all fairness Delmonico greatly lagged. I have definitely had better steak, better sides, and most definitely better dessert elsewhere- most of all a steak that is served with proper sides of lemon!  Also, incase you do end up here please also skip the chocolate cake. The pistachio ice cream does not compliment this desert one bit. I'm still in awe of the ratings others have given this restaurant. The food is off, and in all fairness at the end of the day I cannot EAT the service. I prefer actual tangible, consumable, well dressed and cooked morsels of, yep you got it, FOOD.   Sorry Yelpers- but this restaurant is not worth a return. 2 Stars.",

We didn't even want to try desert ,  we did not get drinks or appetizers and our meal was 170.  I will not come back",

    "text": "Having been to most of the steak places in Vegas I was excited to try something new so I chose Delmonico's.  Had a reservation but arrived early and they go us in fairly quickly. They aren't overly friendly, the barely look at you and they speed you to your table, but that's where I wanted to be anyway. Service in every other way was impeccable. I was pretty impressed with the waitstaff from the start. They were amazing.  Sat down and only had water between me and the business associate I was with. He declined an appetizer, but I chose to have the half dozen oysters on the half shell. They were tiny, but delicious. I definitely would recommend these if you enjoy nice, mildly salty and briny oysters. They had a lot of flavor for the size.  We both ordered steak; I had the bone-in ribeye and he the filet mignon. I also ordered the foie gras to top my steak.  My steak was a nice size and it was cooked medium rare with the outside being a little tough and very seared on the outside making it tasted burned almost. I ate around that and was pleased. It isn't the best steak I've ever had, but the prices were reasonable so it hurt less.   The foie gras was tasteless and a waste of money. I like mine to be buttery and melt in my mouth. Not happening here, save your money. There are a lot better places to get it.  My associate had the filet and I tasted it; it was tender and moist. It was cooked perfectly, but the outside was pepper coated and it tasted bitter. Not a fan of that.  For dessert we split the banana cream pie and it was the best part of the whole night. Highly recommend! It tasted like something my mom would make and I loved it! It was big and we couldn't finish it. I bet it would have tasted awesome right out of the fridge the next day, but alas I left it there.   All in all it's an okay restaurant. I probably won't go back because there are a lot better steak houses, but I enjoyed it for what it was.",

Delmonico was wonderful and would blow the pants off anything with Gordon Ramsey's name attached.  The service here was impeccable. We had multiple servers and they all worked as a team. We never had to ask for anything because they were always on top of it.  The wine list was like a novel!   I ordered the vine-ripened tomato salad with burrata, which was very tasty. For my meal, I had the filet mignon, cooked PERFECTLY medium rare. Overcooked meat does not make me happy, so I was very pleased with how mine came out. I also ordered a baked potato with the works...this potato was HUGE. The waitress even offered to being me more toppings if I ran out.  For dessert, we tried the banana bread pudding which was delicious and very rich with a scoop of ice cream on top.  I was extremely impressed with Delmonico and would absolutely eat there again!",

    "text": "I'll start out by saying the service and environment were both great.  Delmonico seems to draw a good balance between those hyper-formal restaurants where utensil etiquette matters and more casual fine dining restaurants.   I tried the foie gras and octopus appetizers.  The octopus was delicious and had a decent amount of meat.  The foie gras was rich.  I followed these with the gumbo which had a mild spiciness that anyone should be able to enjoy.  The disappointment occurred during the main course.  Three of the people in our party ordered the filet mignon.  Two of us were immediately dissatisfied with the plate.  I had ordered medium-rare and my dissatisfied friend had ordered theirs rare. My filet was noticeably dry and neither were especially tender. I suspect mine may have been overcooked because the third filet was also a medium-rare and the butter on top of their steak was still present, whereas mine had altogether melted by the time the plate reached our table.    Additionally, whatever seasoning was used for my filet was not spread evenly.  There was only one bite where the seasoning became obvious and it overwhelmed the flavor of the meat.  For a steak that costs over $50 at an establishment that is a steakhouse, I hold it to certain standards, like being appreciated by a majority of the people at my party who ordered it. I can understand one person not enjoying their steak at a table because they have specific preferences, but for two people at the same table to be dissatisfied makes me believe the quality of the cooking is unreliable.  I have definitely cooked better steaks than the ones I tried  during this meal, and unfortunately this is the first steakhouse I have been to where that has been the case.",

    "text": "In town for business, had several great meals. However tonight I am eating alone and craving a nice piece of prime cut. I chose this restaurant based on rating and expected value.   Ordered the bone-in prime ribeye, a signature dish, asparagus and a glass of house red.   The service was excellent for the entire meal. The table bread was good but in my opinion was really better suited for breakfast or needed gravy like Yorkshire pudding. The house red (a cab) was excellent, sorry forgot what I ordered, but it was the least expensive but was very good.   Was served quickly, if I had clients with me I would hope for a little slower pace but alone the speed was appreciated.   The asparagus was perfect, not over cooked or smothered with too much butter, and very tender. The ribeye however came up very short, lacked taste and was tough, not what you would expect from aged prime ribeye. The waiter respond quickly and offered a new steak, I decided on the filet. I was served as fast as possible, the new steak rectified the problem, perfectly charbroiled, taste and texture as expected. Also served fresh asparagus.   Dessert, ordered the pecan tart and a cap. Both very good. The pecan very tasteful, the filling was not too runny or too sweet and the pecans were fresh with a deep southern taste. The crust was very favorable and went well with the Carmel and house made ice cream and whipping cream.   Other notes, good lighting and I liked the architectural ceiling. Chairs are stylist and very comfortable. I recommend adjusting the traffic flow, two much weaving required and not ideal for guest seated in wrong location. Never like sitting near restroom entrance, which I was; as much as I like most people watching I would of asked to be moved if with clients or my spouse. Lastly white sugar cubes, really?",

    "text": "Solid.  Still serving up all the flavor, fat, and syrupy opulence one expects from the Emeril Lagasse empire.  Oh, it happens to serve some great steaks.  Lunch is straight forward.  Salads, gumbo, and an INCREDIBLE STEAK SANDWICH.  A juicy skirt steak is topped with loads of roasted mushrooms, onions, wilted spinach and a pungent horseradish mayo on a warm ciabatta roll with a side of crispy truffle fries.  A great deal for under $20.  Dinner brings out the best.  For starters its hard to pass on the truffle parm potato chips (you weren't expecting that huh).  Crispy, earthy, just good eats and so perfect with any cocktail or wine.  The roasted heirloom tomato soup with  grilled ricotta cheese sandwich, creamy and acidic, comforting goodness.  The steaks are all great quality USDA prime.  Well trimmed and dry aged on site.  Unfortunately, the selection of cuts is limited.   The bone in strip, dense beefy goodness and stands up well to the Creole seasoning (used on all their steaks).  Dry aged steak purist will balk at its use as it destroys the umame goodness.  The bone in rib is more tender and makes the perfect base for \"Oscar\" style prep (topped with a generous heaping of jumbo lump crab meat, asparagus, and a very rich and tangy bearnaise that blends perfectly with the creole seasoning). Win!  It's not all about the steaks.  The apple smoked kurobuta ham chop with grits and cider reduction is outstanding.  Pure simplicity.  Natural, tender ham packing  deep \"hammy\" flavor whose richness and saltiness is balanced perfectly by the acidity and sweetness of hard cider reduction.  Holiday ham on steroids!  Friendly and efficient service.  Very good wine list.  Vegas resort prices.  BAM! BAM! BAM! BAM! (Four stars; yeah I couldn't resist).",

I am a creature of habit so I have ordered the same items during my three visits.  Those items (which I highly recommend) included their mixed green salad, filet mignon, twice baked potato and a few Ketel & Sodas.  Their filet is the best steak I have ever had.  Definitely worth the $52.    Call them early in the week to make a reservation If you are planning to dine there on a Friday or Saturday night to guarantee a table.  We spontaneously stopped in for dinner without a reservation and were quoted 1 1/2 hours for a table.  Fortunately, we were able to find two seats at the bar.    Our bill for the two of us, with cocktails came in around $270 with a generous tip for the great service.  Well worth the money and is on our \"Must eat at list.\"",

We began our meal with bbq shrimp, bone-in bacon, and lobster bisque, all of which were delicious.  Now on to the steaks. We ordered bone-in ribeyes and this was by far the best steak I've ever had. It was perfectly prepared and the flavor was out of this world. For our sides we ordered sauteed mushrooms and grits, both of which were equally delicious.  We finished our meal with dessert and we ended up with two, the pecan pie and the caramel butter cake, both of which were, you guessed it, delicious!  Let's talk about the staff and the service.  From the host that greeted us when we walked in, to the gentleman that walked us to our seats, to the three gentlemen that served us, everything and everyone was absolutely delightful.  The three gentlemen serving us were Rene, Brian, and David, and they ran like a well oiled machine.  They were very attentive and very pleasant people, and they helped make our dining experience so wonderful.   The ambiance was perfect for our early xmas dinner.  We had a table where we were able to comfortably eat dinner, have a conversation without screaming at each other, and we weren't wedged between other people being forced to share our dining experience with strangers.   Definitely a five star establishment with five star food and five star service. We will definitely be back.",

Hmmmm as an ex server there is NO WAY IN HELL I WOULD EVER TALK TO ANYONE LIKE THAT. Maybe in this gentlemans mind I am not good enough to be at his job, where he works to get paid, to probably help raise his family.

Why would I want to spend $134 on some wine and food just to be judged? For that I leave the server no tip and I promise I will never tell anyone about this restaurant based on experience alone.

    "text": "During a recent visit to Las Vegas, Delmonico Steakhouse was one of our top priorities. We had heard wonderful things about the food and this review was echoed when our driver commented that Delmonico was \"one of the best steakhouses in the world.\" Upon arriving we felt like VIP guests. The bar was sleek and high class. We were there to celebrate and friend's upcoming move and this was the perfect setting. The dining room was tastefully decorated and the minimalistic style allowed us to focus on the delicious food and good company. Among the appetizers we tried our favorites were the Foie Gras and Crabcakes. The appetizers set the tone for what would be an incredible dining experience. I suppose it should go without saying but the next course was STEAK! Filets and Bone-in Ribeyes were the popular picks with the guest of honor going for the Filet Oscar (a filet topped with jumbo crab meat), which was the group's favorite. The steaks lived up to their reputation. The sides were a la carte and were great for sharing. And it was all tied together with a Sineann Pinot Noir from the expansive wine list. We enjoyed the meal so much we did not get a chance to try the dessert menu. Service was outstanding. Our server, Michael, was very attentive and enhanced the entire experience. Everyone ranked our evening at Delmonico amongst their favorite dining experiences. The food, drinks and service were top-notch and it was the perfect send-off for a good friend.",

    "text": "I was so impressed with the sister restaurant in New Orleans that I opted to make a reservation here for hubby's bday.  We arrived an hour early for our reservation and they were able to seat us.  They sent over a complimentary amuse bouche of steak sate that wowed us while we enjoyed an outstanding Pomegranite Martini and Key Lime Martini.  For people who love wine, the menu is extensive and expensive.  Overall, the food was good (don't order the creamed spinach, it tastes like Birds' Eye frozen), and the service was excellent (thanks, George!).  Pricey, but knew that heading in, and the cuts of meat and preparation met were worth the $$$$ price.  The special salad that evening (mixed baby greens with lavendar and baby brie turnovers and candied pecans was much better than my proscioutto (chewy slab, not shaved) and mozzarella.  A nice place for a special dinner.  Overall I have to say I enjoyed the food at the NOLA location but liked the sophisticated atmosphere and vibe of this Venetian restaurant better.  Glad we went but next time I'm in Vegas not sure I wouldn't head back without trying another similar restaurant first.",

I am a chef, and a succesful one I've ran restaurants and now I am a private chef, so I know food and service! I was with my girlfriend and another couple, from the start we were treated like we didn't belong there. They forgot to bring us our wine for like 20 minutes. The table beside us arrived after us and recieved their wine and food before us! They recieved excellent service, getting a amuse bouch, and all served at the same time! We were treated like dishwashers. I thought the food was ok, crabcake was decent but lacked simple seasoning salt and pepper! I thought they would at least make there own bread, but no. The ribeyes were charred black and had no seasoning, filet was ok but lacked seasoning. Gnocchi was great but a little salty. All in all food lacked seasoning, waiter was a asshole, all though the manager was cool I will never step foot in there again!!!!!!!!",

The restaurant is right next to the passageway to the Palazzo Hotel and it sits right in front of the Blue Man theater. The ambience was nice except I took off a star for the boring cream colored walls.   The food was great! I had a filet mignon while the other three all had a bone in ribeye. Ohmigosh...i couldn't believe how big these things were! They were ginormous! Anyway, the sides were yummy! We had the garlic mushrooms, steamed asparagus, baked potatoes, potato chips, and spinach! Geez...i know we couldn't even get to all of them!  Their famous banana cream pie was delicious! It was a little frozen...I prefer it to be a bit more thawed...but it was still good!  Their dinner rolls..ok...this is so Filipino but damn..it tasted like hot pan-de-sal! It was so good! Hahaha...seriously. Emeril's gotta be stealing Goldilock's or Valerio's pandesal recipe!   $400 for the 4 of us....it's alright...step outside and play roulette! Make sure you put it all on red!",

In retrospect, it's a delicious gourmet establishment with a small menu that features a lot of variety - which I find to be extremely rare.   The service was excellent and the staff was patient with us asking questions about the food. The environment was very relaxed and there was plenty of space between each table so you felt like you had a bubble around your table.   They don't allow flip flops! but they didnt say anything to me...its just on the bottom of their business card :)",

    "text": "Intro: As is the case with most (if not all) steakhouses, don't fuss with too many appetizers.  Go straight for the beef.  Food: Chateaubriand, carved tableside with seasonal vegetables - it was hearty, it was tasty.  Very simple presentation - there is nothing between you and the food.  Sauteed Garlic Mushrooms - The sauce left a funny, stingy, slighty charred aftertaste.  Not a fan.  Wine List:  Seriously lacking.  What's this of not having ANY Chateauneuf Du Pape?  Ambiance: Elegant, modern, simple, and warm.  I wouldn't mind living in this place.  Service: He did his best, but it was quite apparent that he was tired.  The poor guy.  When asked for a suggestion on a Red, he immediately suggested that there was a sommelier onsite.  C'mon buddy, you gotta try just a little, even if it is bulldoohicky!   Overall: Be warned - you're paying for the ambiance and the Emeril name.  The food was delicious, but really not uberrifically succulent and extraordinary and memorable and, and....need I go on.",

    "text": "As I have been to the Emeril Delmonico restaurant in New Orleans and enjoyed it immensely, I decided to have dinner at the Delmonico Steakhouse located in the Venetian Resort Hotel & Casino where I was attending the Phantom of the Opera later that evening (incredible show by the way!).  What you'll find is a variety of food selections with Creole influences.   First the menu prices are expensive ($$$$) but you are there for the intimate and fine dining experience and should be expecting to pay those prices.  What I didn't expect was to be dressed up and have an individual in shorts, sandals, and a Baltimore Colts jersey seated at an adjacent table to me.  Kind of lowered my view of this establishment being world class if you know what I mean.  I started with the Lobster Bisque which was just superb but did lack the \"Creole\" twist I was expecting (The BAM factor).  Only thing that was a little of an inconvenience was the lobster pieces were quite large and were hard to cut with my spoon.  The wife selected the Organic Baby Mixed Greens Salad Creole Spiced Croutons, Sherry Vinaigrette, Shaved Manchego Cheese Roasted Teardrop Tomatoes and Shaved Red Onion.  I had a taste and it was very good.  The different flavors were unique and distinctive.  The main course I selected a Pinot Noir wine that to go along with my Ribeye Steak and selected the Roasted Fingerling Potatoes and Whole Garlic with Fresh Herbs.  The wine was fantastic with a rich and bold body and floral aroma.  Wasn't dry and complimented the Ribeye Steak very well.  The Ribeye has Emeril's classic touch written all over it with the blackened spice rub with a pat of herb butter on top.  The cut was 1-1/2 inches thick, lean, and very large portion.  The potato dish was okay, didn't impress me in any way.  The wife also had the Pinot Noir and selected the Filet Mignon.  The cut had to be nearly 2 inches thick, lean, and a normal portion size.  I recommend selecting your Ribeye to be cooked medium rare (I do not recommend medium) and your Filet Mignon medium rare or at the most medium.    Sorry to say we were extremely full when we finished and couldn't partake of dessert.  The meal described above with tip was roughly $210.",

My boyfriend and I ordered a Lobster Bisque to share, which was good but not especially exciting. He ordered a Filet Mignon, I believe, and was fantastic! It literally melted in my mouth and we were able to cut it with a butter knife.. so tender! I ordered a season entree - Grilled halibut on a bed of lumbcrab meat w/ some kind of aioli. It was alright... the crab was tasty but the fish was a bit dry...   Our friend ordered the Tournedos au Poivre and his girlfriend ordered the Ribeye. The Ribeye was huge for the price! We also ordered a couple of sides to share - New Orleans Creamed Spinach, Sauteed Garlic Mushrooms and Truffle Parmesan Potato Chips. I have to say the mushrooms was really good! Didn't really care for the creamed spinach because it was too heavy for me. The chips was good, too, but I wanted to compare it to Alexander's Truffle oil fries... That's one of my future plans =P  Overall, I think the steaks are worth the price. Other stuff are good but not extremely exciting.... I guess you should always go for the steaks at a steakhouse!",

Their bone-in steak ran about $48. Their appetizer salad special of the day (which I had as an entree) was $20. Don't believe what the vegas tourist book says. It said it's \"$$\", where in actuality was more like \"$$$$\". I don't think I'd go there again. My friend said his lobster bisque soup was just \"okay\" and not as good as another, less expensive place. He said it was bland and not much flavor to it. Their twice-baked potato was pretty good, but I can imagine how unhealthy it is for you.   Their setting is nice though - dimly lit in some parts of the restaurant. Great for couples or dates. And if you want to go there, make sure it's something special like a birthday or anniversary. That's probably the only time I'd go back IF I ever went back.",

Our servers were on top of everything but not intrusive & the manager, Rene, was friendly  & knowledgeable about all aspects of the restaurant.  For our appetizers, we had oysters on the 1/2 shell, wilted spinach salad & heirloom tomato soup.  All were yummy.  We've come to realize that splitting a steak between 3 people is the way to go.  In the past, half our steak would go to waste as these steaks are huge!  We split a bone in ribeye and there was still a couple of pieces left over. The reason you get so full is because the sides at Delmonico are out of this world! This time around we had the potatoes au gratin, creamed spinach & creamed corn.  I could make a meal on Delmonico side dishes alone - they're that good!  While they've served up delicious desserts in the past (what? No more bread pudding?), we just didn't have room for dessert this time.  I can't wait until we are back in Vegas again & have the time to stop by this gem of a restaurant.  It's True culinary bliss!",

My wife loved her dessert, I just can't remember what she got!    Service was ok... but seeing the service other people got made us realize it was probably just our waitstaff that was lacking.

    "text": "I really enjoyed my experience in here. Its an expensive place so save it for a special night out, unless you're wealthy, than feel free to splurge all you want.   From the outside, the restaurant seems small, but once you walk in you'll see its a lot bigger and most of their clients are seated there instead. Spacious seating and dim lighting, everyone is dressed up.  My party tried out:  Appetizer: Emeril's shrimp, it wasn't bad. I was delicious, but not necessarily memorable or jaw dropping. Our waiter recommended it to us and it wasn't a bad choice.  Soup: Lobster bisque, delicious!!! This is the best lobster bisque I've had in recent memory. A lot of the bisques I've had always added too much wine into so the wine flavor killed the lobster's, but this one was well balanced! Kudos!  Entrees: BBQ Salmon, genuinely surprised at how delicious this was. Moist, flavorful, but not overbearing. Potato hash and onion strips went well with it. I ordered a side of mashed potatoes too, which was great. The waiter warned me that I had a lot of potatoes, but I don't mind. Plus, I shared my mash with my party. Other members in my party had the filet mignon and ribeye. I'm not a particular fan of ribeye because of its texture, but they managed to make me like it.   We didn't order any dessert, but we did have a few cups of Blue Mountain to end the evening. Soothing, relaxing, and it was a perfect ending to a nice meal.  The service was great, our waiter was very efficient, honest, and attentive. No snobby elitist attitude, which is always appreciated. The price is expensive, but what do you expect? Its Vegas! You're going to be spending a lot if you want to have a good time here.",

Let's start with the wine list - the night in question they were out of the slightly over $100 (inexpensive for the restaurant) bottle of Cab that I selected,  Not really a problem - found one that cost just a little more.  However, later in the meal one of the waiters informed me of another Cab (not on the list) that cost about the same as the one I originally selected but was much better than the one I ended up with. Why not inform me of this BEFORE I selected another bottle?  Strike one.  It was a Sunday night and I was informed that they were out of the special of the day - some sort of fish. Again not a problem as we came in for BEEF.  Just thought I would mention it...  The wedge salad - the bacon bits served with it were cold, greasy, and very tough.  Not good. The salad itself was fine - good blue cheese and nice and crisp- but for what you are paying the bacon should have been as well. Strike two.  Now on to the steak.- the \"signature\" bone in rib eye. It was good. Very good in fact. - a huge cut cook just as I orded. But...it was kind of bland. Not totally lacking in flavor but still kind of bland.  Not bad, but not the best steak I had ever eaten.  My friend's filet was also very good - an excellent cut cooked as ordered but still a bit - shall we say?- unseasoned?  Call this half a strike.  Now on to the pecan pie and ice cream thingy - yummy. Best part of the meal!  All in all, Emeril's Delmonico is not bad.  Just that I was expecting more...",

So you think 'oops, they just forgot to take it out, right?' Well, when you think about dining at such a nice place, a steakhouse at that, with famous chefs and executive chefs and the sort....should they even need to have to use the little plastic things to tell when or how a steak should be cooked?   Since it was my mother's birthday they brought her out a free scoop of sorbet. ....yes it could have been nothing, but a scoop of sorbet at a fancy restaurant??? - a baked slice of cake or something made by a pastry chef would have been a little more appropriate and suiting.   The atmosphere too was very cold and there was no warmth or decor to the place.   The service was, however, excellent! Very professional and nice. They did take care of the 'slip up,' but I must say, \"with all the places in Vegas, I will not be dining there again.\"",

Entree - I had the filet mignon was good perfectly cooked and marinated I asked for the house sauce but realize I didn't need it. My friend had the Rib eye and boy did that blow my mind. One bite and I fell in love with it. I would have eaten his whole steak but realized I had mine to finish.

The pappardelle mushroom pasta appetizer was not quite as flavorful a dish as I anticipated, but very good none the less. Also had the truffle and Parmesan potato chips, which are a MUST HAVE!!  The Bone in New York Strip was quite possibly the most flavorful steak I have had in a long time if not ever. The Service was spot on and the atmosphere was relaxed. My wife and I visit Vegas once a year and we will be sure to make it to Delmonico's at least once per trip from now on.",

Come-on this is what you expect when you are eating at a college kid barbeque party.  While my gf order the shrimp pasta and that was unbelievably oily if you are going to cook with sausage one knows hit has natural oil so you dont need to fill up the frying pan with extra oil, someone needs to question the cooks they got.  Baked oyster was alright it was tasty, but buttery and oily as well, but still flavorful.   The only thing good about this place is the service.  The main waiter was very helpful when choosing a cocktail.  The servers where very friendly as well.   Bottom line: This place can cost over $150 person, depends what and quantity of order, skip the food at this place just come for cocktails.  This place got two stars for service and cocktails.  Would have gotten four if I was describing a lounge or bar.",

Everything was very tasty and well seasoned, but we didn't find the food to be spectacular as expected.  Not sure if it was all the alcohol we have been consuming the past 2 days, but none of us could finish out 16 ounce steak - which was a damn disgrace in our books.  Though overall the experience was good, we doubt we would return anytime soon because there are just so many other steakhouses in the city to try out.",

    "text": "One of the best restaurants from Emeril.  A group of us dined here while in Vegas.  I ordered the ahi tuna/salmon tartare as an appetizer.  It was amazing!  The ahi and salmon tasted very fresh.  The fish is divied by a small amount of seaweed salad.  It's served with wonton chips, cucumber/onion \"salad\", and a trio of wasabi sauces.  For dinner I ordered the ribeye steak.  It was HUGE.  I was expecting small portions since it's the case at most fancy restaurants. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to finish my steak.  And most hotels in Vegas do not have a fridge or microwave in the room.  So, I couldn't take it with me.  For dessert, the group shared the bread pudding with butter pecan ice cream, chocolate cake, and pecan pie.  And these were not your typical \"pecan pie\" or \"chocolate cake\".  They were all delicious and decadent! You have to try them to really understand.  Overall, my dining experience was wonderful.  The service is impeccable and the restaurant has a warm ambiance to it.  Yes, it's pricey, but you are going to a famous chef's restaurant.",

    "text": "My Husband took me here for our anniversary dinner. We arrived early at five because we had theatre tickets and had made dinner reservations accordingly.  The restaurant is beautiful with cream walls, rock wood and glass throughout with romantic lighting the evening was looking good. We ordered starters Crab Cakes for my husband nice crispy well seasoned crab I love a crab cake that is more crab then filler and this one was that. I ordered the steak tartar because I've never had it and wanted to be daring. I have to say I was scared lol but it was so worth it. Wonderful crisp toasted baguettes with rich beef capers oil and seasoning and spicy mustard sauce  this has got to be one of the best dishes I've ever eaten and a must try. We then followed this with Lobster bisque  rich warm and creamy with plenty of lobster one of my favorite lobsters bisques definitely.  I had the petite iceberg lettuce wedges a nice take on the classic salad with Wisconsin blue cheese buttermilk dressing homemade apple wood bacon and just the right amount of red onion really tangy. For our entree we had chosen to go with the  Chateaubriand for two. They carve it tableside and serve it with asparagus and garlic potatoes The sides were actually very good but the meat was just ok nothing special and more red then I care for We had also ordered a side of sauteed garlic wild mushrooms which were also just ok I've had better versions of both these dishes. On to dessert we were bad and ordered two. The Chocolate root beer float which was not that great I guess we just didn't care for the ginger and chocolate flavors together so we didn't finish this one but the banana cream pie was like biting into heaven little shavings of chocolate rich sweet whipped cream bananas and sweet rich caramel sauce make up this dish and it's worth every calorie that's probably packed into it. So splurge and have it it's amazing. The wait staff was amazing making sure you never wanted for anything and that everything went smoothly and the wine selection and service was top notch. Definitely worth the splurge",

    "text": "We were disappointed. Went there for anniversary dinner... There was no Bam, no kicking it up a notch, just kind of taste-free. Although we had three people assigned to the table the service was slow. After dropping the menus it took a while to take our drink order, and then a while longer to get them. but then we got the food before we finished the cocktail. OK. The main complaint is that the food just wasn't that good. Foie gras to start was OK, the wife had the filet and I had buffalo ribeye.  I knew buffalo is iffy, whether you get meat or gristle, but the waiter assured me it was not gamey. Well, this one didn't change my mind--the center was good but I had to do a lot of chewing to get to it. The filet was chewy and really had no taste to it. Creamed spinach had a definite cream taste, but where was the BAM? Same thing with twice baked potatoes--too liquid. To finish we had the espresso creme brulee, which was good, but too cold; with chocolate madelines that were not warm, and again, tasteless.  Just not worth the price we paid at all. I mean I've had better steak at Outback. Sorry Emeril.",

    "text": "Food quality disappointing. Not the best steak in Vegas.  Three of us enjoyed two ribeyes ($52) and one filet ($46). Waiter told us their ribeye is the best steak in Vegas, but don't believe it. They were cooked correctly. The rub was rather bland and the crusting on the filet was hard. On a scale of one to ten, my ribeye overall was a 7. I've had 10's before in Vegas, so the competition is tough! But just claiming you have the best steak doesn't make it so.  The sides ($9 each) were disappointing. We ordered four. Creamed spinach, always a favorite of mine and recommended by the waiter, was just odd and bland - didn't taste interesting or flavorful at all. The best side was the asparagus, but honestly, how hard is it to steam asparagus?  Desert, as it often is at these kind of places where desert is an afterthought, was disappointing and ended the overall experience on a \"blah\" note.  Wine list was excellent.  With so many great places in Vegas, you can do much better. Everything else was top notch, but the food is the core of the experience and Delmonicos is just average, unfortunately.",

    "text": "About 2 years ago, I had dreamed of eating steak at Delmonico's.  The reputation of this place exceeds my expectations; and, as such, is my dilemma with this place.  Delmonico's is Emeril lagasse's steak house.  It is his prime choice, so-to-speak, and it has one of the prime locations between the Palazzo and the Venetian, right in front of the Blue Man Group entrance, across from V-bar, B&B, and next door to Aquaknox.  I've walked by this place numerous times and always wanted to eat there.  Suffice to say, in the past two years, I have.  In short, I have eaten at Delmonico's 6 times.  Not bad for someone that gives this place 3-stars.    Pros:  Wine list is expansive and can be very intimidating.  However, I question the knowledge of one of the staff when they recommended a pinot for our bone-in ribeye.  I know a little bit about wine, well, who I am I kidding, I pretend to know a lot.  Enough to the point that I didn't think I'd want a pinot.  However, it was his recommendation and I thought I would go with it.  It was definitely a pinot.  Very disappointed since the body of it didn't fit right with our bone-in ribeye (which was my concern to begin with). The steak is choice (to steal my favorite John Hughes film). Can sit large groups fairly easily. Will sit a table fairly late (almost 11pm on a Friday night). Excellent sides. They are fairly attentive with the service. The scotch list is reasonable.  However, I do usually get a vodka martini with blue cheese stuffed olives (and they hit it pretty good).   They do have a chef's table near the kitchen.  For a heavy trafficked weekend, I believe you have to book well into 3-months in advance (numbers change based on availability).  I am interested in trying this because I think it would be a blast to have a bunch of friends, drinking out of a magnum, and eating some good steak (but I'm not that organized nor do I have an event to do that with).  Well, who am I kidding, I don't even have that many friends.  Ha!  Anyways...  Cons:  I always get the bone-in ribeye and each time I've eaten it, the seasoning (which I believe is a cajun based creole seasoning) is slightly different each time.  In some cases the seasoning can be too much and in others, its not enough.  There just isn't any consistency. All but one time I've eaten here someone has gotten the ribeye too rare or too well-done.  The fact that they can't get this right concerns me.  You are a steakhouse; get it right; its what you are supposed to be good at! The decor is more monastery like.    The first time I ate here, I gave it 4-stars (my meal was great, my girlfriends meal wasn't cooked right).  If they clean up their act and make things tight and organized, I think Delmonico's is a 4-star steakhouse.  The steak is pretty tasty.  Its perfectly okay to pick up the bone and start gnawin on it.  Well, within reason of course.  However, it has too much inconsistency between day to day operations and meals.  To be fair, I'd still come and eat here (cause I believe the steak is an excellent quality of meat) but with the competition being so tight in Vegas, I've started to venture out.",

Thankfully, I appreciate a good burrito as much as I appreciate a good steak, but I will definitely seize every opportunity to dine in style as much as I can.  Thanks to a family trip to Vegas, I got to eat at Emeril's, once more partaking our family's favorite pasttime: eating. We had eaten at the original location in New Orleans when I lived there, and it was one of my top 5 dining experiences of all time. This one definitely tied that experience.  As other people have said, if you're not going to eat steak in some form when you come here, you're wasting your time. The steak is truly a peak experience for meat lovers. We all ate our  steaks in silence, save for the \"OMG!\" and \"MMMM!\" and \"wow.wow.wow.\"  They all had the filet mignon, and I had the bone-in dry aged ribeye: the best steak I have ever eaten in my life. It came on a bed of perfectly creamy garlic mashed potatoes and foie gras butter just melting into it.   Have you ever had lightly tempura battered asparagus? It's worth coming here just to try them.   Even the sides- delicious spinach he made without cream that was STILL good (shocking, I know), and broccoli cooked to perfection...we all kept remarking how absolutely everything was just perfect.  The other thing that distinguishes restaurants like this is the service.  Places like this are in a whole other league- waiters who seem to read your mind, appearing and disappearing before you even realized you needed something - never interrupting conversation, never hovering, always classy and helpful. Our waiter chose the perfect wine for us with with the vague descriptions of what we were looking for, and it truly was the best complement to our meals ever.   The design of the room is also a refreshing breath of fresh air from all the gaudy glitz and obnoxious 'bigness' of Vegas; simple, clean lines and understated elegance and chairs that make it seem like your table is totally self-contained and isolated from the other tables. Great to have that feeling of privacy.  We lingered for hours just basking in the glow of such perfection and decadence.",

He was polite, offered to educate the waitstaff, but did not ask who my waiter was. He obviously didn't really care beyond being polite.  I had a few good cocktails, potatoes, and a distinctly different cut of meat than I ordered ... with no offer to bring me even a taste of ribeye.

Since almost anyone can cook a good steak, going to a steakhouse is about service, about the experience. It is INSULTING to be ignored.",

    "text": "This has to be the best steakhouse i have ever been to in my life. I would recommend anybody who is dining at the strip to try this once. This is a great steakhouse, reservations are a must as we went at 5pm on a Thursday and they were pretty much full and they open at 5.   The restaurant is right next to the theaters in between the Venetian and palazzo. The place is huge and the service is excellent.  We ordered the chateaubriand steak for two which was 18oz and they carved the steak and cooked it to perfection right on tableside. We also got the mashed potatoes along with creamy spinach for the sides but just the steak alone was so tasty you don't really bother with the sides even though we did.   The server was super professional and from start to finish they crushed it and made sure we enjoyed the dinner.  5 stars all the way. This is the restaurant which deserves more as lots of places get the 5 star rating. Delmonico should open up a place in South Florida so i don't have to go to Vegas just to enjoy a steak, just a suggestion.",

    "text": "This was our group's 2nd Vegas visit in a row going to Delmonico Steakhouse, and I can only imagine we'll be trying a new steakhouse next time.   In our previous visit, the meal was perfect.  However this time, the two of us who ordered the Bone-In NY Strip Steak felt that our steaks were poor quality.  The meat was very tough and chewy, and although I'd ask for my steak to be cooked medium rare, it was definitely rare if not undercooked in the middle.  I didn't want to send it back, but the meat was so inedible I couldn't justify not saying something and hoping for the best.  The waiter was responsive enough to offer a new steak, but I opted for cooking it more.  And when it came back, it appeared that someone in the kitchen was offended and took it out on the steak by leaving it in there until parts of it were black.    Overall the best part of the meal was the caesar salad.  But that's not why anyone goes to a steakhouse, so perhaps it's on to the next steakhouse.",

    "text": "One word my friends: tableside!!! Yes, tableside carving of your steak chateaubriand for two/Creekstone farm steaks never disappoints. One of the best dinners I had this year for sure.  I would recommend Delmonico restaurant in Vegas who ever goes to Vegas or lives there.    Delmonico is settled within the Venetian hotel and with a 5 pm dinner reservation , they were pretty busy by 6 pm. I'm assuming people want to eat good streak before different shows and other entertainment in Vegas. Service was impeccable with the server and assistant both working harmoniously together.  The restaurant is not overly pretentious or glamorous looking.  I liked the overall atmosphere with the white walls/crisp white tablecloths on the tables with dim lighting.    The service starts with the complimentary brioche bread and butter which were decadently heavenly.  Then they entice and educate you about their wine list etc but I don't drink so I was ready to order some steak, steak, steak! I did the chateaubriand steak for two carved for us.  It was a 18oz steak but really my 9 oz share was big but so yummy so yes I was able to finish my portion.  The garlic smashed potatoes were delicious.  The creamed spinach was just ok, a bit of a let down.   Other than that I enjoyed every minute of my dinner before my red eye flight back to Florida.",

Each course was delicious. Honestly could have spent $38 pp at any of the other Venetian restaurants so felt this course experience was worth it.  The one thing that seemed odd was the interior decor...it's pretty stark. Plain white walls, little to nothing as far as decor, devoid of personality (just seemed oddly stuffy for a chef with as much personality as Emeril).",

    "text": "I really enjoyed my Vegas trip here and this spot was one of the reasons.  Its an older looking restaurant and by that I don't mean decor but class.  I should have said its more of a matured restaurant.  The spot is elegant and classy. From the hostess to the waitress, this spot screams fancy.  We had a lovely dinner here during our Vegas trip.   Before dinner we grabbed a few drinks.  They were really solid.  I guess in Vegas I can be a bit more loose.  Located inside the Venetian, it was actually my second time visiting this hotel.  Its an incredible spot. I love everything about it.  We were seated and given a menu.  After about a few minutes were decided to run with the bone in ribeye.  Boy was I in for a treat, tasty treat.  The meat was super juicy.  The juices flowed through with every bite.  Cooked to perfection, this piece of steak is highly recommended in my books.   To be honest, when it arrived I wasn't sure if I was gonna be able to finish it but after several bites, I kept at it, wanting more.    Overall this was actually one of my favorite restaurants.  I caught a glimpse of this spot a few years back and had been wanting to give it a try ever since.  Finally I was able to and it was worth it.  The bone in ribeye is definitely my favorite for about 55 bucks.  The filet was solid too I'm told by my counterpart, but no regrets on my end.  We had a lovely time.  Chances of returning are very high.",

Nothing (except for one of the sides) was actively bad, but for a restaurant with Emeril's name on it and the reputation Delmonico has, I was sorely disappointed.  Least impressive restaurant we tried on this trip to Vegas, and far and away the most expensive.  I don't think I'll be going back  Started out with the BBQ shrimp, as our server recommended.  They were okay.  Certainly nothing to complain about, but nothing spectacular.  I had the bone-in ribeye, another server suggestion. It was, again, okay.  Far from the best steak I've ever had, but very tasty.  The char on the meat was a little bit overdone, in my opinion (I got a clear taste of 'burnt' with a few bites).  For some reason I decided to order fries with my steak (which the waiter was more than a little bit condescending about) and they were terrible. The key lime pie is a solid dessert.  On the whole, this place is resoundingly meh.  Which wouldn't bother me nearly as much if it weren't for the reputation and cost.  I was let down.",

Prices are typical of a business lunch environment with appetizers around $15 and entrees $17-24, for the most part.    First off, the popovers are addictive.  You get 2 to begin and I imagine I could've put back 5 if given the chance.  The lobster bisque and lobster sliders were fresh and completely satisfied my shellfish craving.  The bisque at lunch was $13 ($18 at dinner, so a great deal).  The sliders were $24 and came with 2, lobster-filled sandwiches with Cajun-seasoned fries.  The bisque was creamy and an insanely good compliment for the dipping powers of the popovers.  The sliders were a little bland as far as the totality of the dish, since it was simply tasty bread and lobster, but still fresh and meaty. The bisque comes highly recommended - one of the best soups I've had in Vegas.  The meal came out quickly and we were in and out in less than an hour - perfect for a business meal.  Delmonico is one of the best business lunch locales in Vegas.  Well done Emeril.  Full and satisfied, knowing you put back some great food, is the perfect feeling walking out after a nice lunch.",

    "text": "\"WOW!!!\" that's what she said... literally! lol, actually that's what we all said after we took our first bite into the appetizer (bbq shrimp). Let me back track a little bit though. I made a reservation for four on open table... we were running a little late so I called and to let them know. They were very friendly and accommodating with our late arrival. As soon as we get there, they said \"You must be Jason, party of 4 correct?\" Very nice touch for a first impression. We were greeted by our main server, followed by the assistants. Our server made good conversation and awesome recommendations. We never felt bugged, rushed, or belittled (since we all look pretty young). Even with the huge wine list, we were scratching our heads and our server recommended a VERY good syrah that fitted within our budget.  Between the 4 of us, we ordered the bbq shrimp, filet mignons, lobster tail, and I ordered the rib eye. Seriously, every bite was WOW! Cooked to exactly the way you ask!!! You have to try it for yourself and you'll understand the WOW factor this restaurant has!  While making my reservations, I noted that it was a special dinner for me and my wife, along with my friend and his wife (our anniversaries of dating). lol...anyways, when we were about to ask for our check, the staff came out with two bowls of fresh strawberry sherbert/sorbet with a candle in it, followed by the words \"Happy Anniversary to you both and Thank You for coming to Delmonicos\"! I wanted to stand and applaud! hahahah Our server then went on to take our digital camera's and take a couple pics of us.  If you're looking for a restaurant with that WOW factor (and you love meat), I highly recommend visiting Delmonico's.",

Bone in rib eye: Nice big piece of steak with a bit of fat, which is the way I like my steak.   Chateaubriand: 2 big pieces of fillet Mignon that also comes with a side of steamed asparagus and mashed potatoes finished at table side for two people. Fillet was SO tender and juicy, probably one of the best I've had! Not an asparagus person so it was bleh. Mashed potatoes were ok.   I would love to go back again with my boyfriend and have a romantic dinner.",

So happy to see foie gras on their menu but it was just ok - I've had better.  The scalloped potatoes were under cooked so we had to send it back - boo boo.  Everything else was ok.  Great service.",

    "text": "I didn't come here for the steak...but the fish was just as good! Plus, this was one of the few restaurants that was still seating at like 10pm on a Monday night.   A must try is the lobster potato gnocchi appetizer. It is heavenly! I want to order like 5 of these and make it into my entree! The gnocchi is prepared in my favorite way- toasted and a bit crispy on the outside. Yum! And of course, there was a hefty serving of lobster knuckle meat!  For my main dish, I had the sturgeon with crab lumps in a lemon butter sauce. Again, I was impressed! Lots of crab meat and everything was full of flavor. I also tried some of the bone-in ribeye, which was huuuuge. If you're super hungry, order a steak from here and you won't be disappointed. For dessert, I had the chocolate bread pudding, which was good...but a bit too rich and chocolate-y. I would've preferred a traditional bread pudding.  I should take off one star for the strand of hair I found baked into my bread...but the rest of my meal made up for it, so it didn't bother me too much!",

    "text": "I feel like Twitter is pretty useless so far; I have an ok amount of followers I guess, but I feel like they're all following so many people that anything I say gets lost in the mess of their feed. I could tweet all day and get very little response to anything aside from a couple loyal folks on there. And it was one such reader that led me to Delmonico recently for what he claimed to be an excellent burger. He's a food writer in town so he should know what he's talking about, right?  Delmonico is located in the small restaurant row of the Venetian right by another great burger spot, although most people would not come here for their burger. The interior is nothing too fancy in either the bar area or more traditional area in the back. I did notice while sitting at the bar that they have an amazing bourbon selection, but since I was there during a lunch break I'll have to go back some time when I'm not on the clock. The lunch and dinner menus are a bit different, with the lunch menu featuring more sandwiches and things, so maybe the comment I just made about people not coming for a burger is wrong. Either way, this restaurant is pretty fancy and features quite a number of great sounding items aside from what I came there for.  The Delmonico Prime Hamburger comes on a toasted brioche roll with fries, cheddar cheese and bacon. The meat had excellent flavor from the first bite, but I noticed right away that it was way overcooked and dry. It started off extremely juicy but that faded way too fast and by the end it was very dry. The cheese was melted and had great flavor, but the bun was a tiny bit dry as well and a little too thick. The heirloom tomatoes were fantastic, but maybe a bit off-putting at first due to their green color. The bacon also had good flavor, but was a tiny bit undercooked and soggy in parts. Overall it was still decent, but could have been well beyond that if the meat had been cooked properly.  Luckily the fries were great. Some of them were almost a bit too hard and crunchy, but they were very tasty and a welcome change to the 'typical' fries I often get around town. Something I found to be quite funny was when I asked for ketchup I was brought an insanely large bowl of it, more than probably a table full of people could have used.  The online menu lists the burger at $15, so I was a little surprised to see the $18 listed on the menu when I made my order. I think if it was cooked properly I would still be ok with this price given the chef, the location, etc, but because of this price I seriously frown on the fact that they couldn't cook my burger properly. If you're willing to risk this inconsistency and are ok with the cost, I think it's a good burger to check out, and has the potential to be really great, but if you're at the Venetian and are craving a guaranteed good burger for a similar cost I suggest you go next door.",

Took great care of us and explain the specials thoroughly.  Also helped gave us the idea that the last person at the table should take care of the tab. =)  Their whole menu sounds tasty....good selection of meats and a lot of sides/appetizers to accommodate your needs.  I ordered the Truffle Oil & Parmesan Potato Chips for my appetizer. OMG....it tasted so good.  Best chips I've ever had!!!  It's crunchy...tasty...and best of all...it's cheesy!  For my entree....I stucked with their Bone-in Rib Eye with a side of corn. I always like my steak medium rare and they cooked it to perfection.  Steak was super tender and juicy.  Dash some horse-radish on the side and I'm happy.  My buddy Eugene ordered their \"Tomahawk\" which is basically a 32 oz. Ribeye with a big ass rib to boot.  He topped it off....of course....with some foie gras.    Most of the table ordered their own rib eye steak....and ordered a lot of different sides to mix it up.  I'll say my favorite was the Wild Mushrooms and the Grits.  Overall, pretty good...will definitely come back to give this place a second spin.",

We had the wilted spinach salad and the baby green salad. Both were wonderful and bursting with flavor. Then came the rib eye steaks! They were to die for. They were huge and very tender. The flavor was outstanding and they were both cooked to perfection. We were too full for desert but had to try the banana cream pie . Whatever you do don't miss it! One piece was plenty for two people to share. The best dining experience ever! Made out trip to Vegas extra special!",

I had been to Delmonico's in New Orleans many years ago and my Hubby and I frequented Emeril's in Orlando when we lived in Tampa. We were not disappointed!! I had requested a romantic booth and that's exactly where we were seated!! This experience was wonderful and memorable! For starters, our wait staff was Amazing! Kudos to Mark, Dan and Tyke. We started with the Carpaccio and Green Salad - both fresh and delicious! I ordered a special Ribeye that was not on the menu that Mark told me about. Divine! Hubby got the Japanese Waygu and said it was the most tender Ribeye he had ever eaten! For wine, we opted for a 1/2 bottle of a 2007 Chateauneuf-du-Pape that was perfect for our entrees. For dessert, we got the Chocolate Decadence Cake that was delicious! The only negative was the Pistachio Ice Cream had shells in the first bite. The Manager was summoned and the dessert was taken off the bill and he offered us the choice of another dessert which we declined. Overall, a wonderful dining experience and we would gladly return!!",

First of all, the high-end white tablecloth fancy decor with everyone in suits and ties is not fitting for a steakhouse.  The steaks were not memorable and I have had much better for less money.  I do not recall if the steaks are grilled or broiled but I do recall mine was overcooked and for such a high-end fancy place, I would expect better.  If you are looking for quality steak in Vegas and willing to spend some cash, I would try many others before this place.",

I ordered Bone in New York strip and Mr.Q ordered himself  Bone in rib eye. The presentation of the steak looks poor, when I saw the giant portion of sizzling steak was drowning in the oil and come out in a hot plate.  I told myself \" that couldn't be good\". It made me changed my mind immediately after I took my first bite. It was juicy, meaty, tasty, tender and much much more. Wow! Amazingly tasty! The quality of the steak is really good.  The steak is d*mn good, but huge. I left half of it. What a waste of such beautiful piece, I wish I could bear a spandex tummy instead of wear spandex dress.  Thank you Chung for the wonderful recommendation and a wonderful happy tummy evening for me and Mr.Q.",

I gave up and started eating the salad anyway, and when I pulled out a long dark curly hair, I stopped. They took the salad away, and three people apologized, but they didn't offer me another appetizer. They did make up for the unconvinced by comping our corkage, dessert, and, of course, the salad. It was a nice way to make up, but we didn't find out about that until the end of the meal.",

We were staying at the Venetian and this location is conveniently located within the beautiful hotel so it was an easy choice for dinner. It is definitely nice not having to step outside of the AC when the average temperature outside is 115!   I got the caesar salad to start and filet mignon for the main dish. Some of the side items we got were spinach, asparagus, wild mushrooms, and creamed corn gratinee. The main dishes do not come with sides so they are extra but the portions are large enough to share.   I asked for my filet mignon to be medium rare and it was done perfectly. The steak was so tender and delicious! It was definitely one of the best steaks I have had. The sides complimented the meat nicely and everything single one of them were delicious. I wish I could comment on their deserts but we were both so full by the end of the meal that we decided to skip desert. This restaurant is a must if you are in Vegas!",

    "text": "The misleading reviews that others wrote about this place have almost made me lose all faith in Yelp.  In short, this place is NOT worth your money. No. No. No.  Let's recap why.  The service was hit or miss. When we got there a few minutes early for a reservation, I let them know we would wait for a good table. Instead, the hostess tried to sit us at a table next to a portable cooking station and this little room where the waiters get extra plates, forks, etc. Worst seat in the house. No joke. It was after 10 p.m. on a Friday. The place WAS packed, but there were a few better tables left. Why do us like this?  So we ask for a better table. Hostess walks us all the way back out of the dining room, looks at computer, walks us all the way back into dining room, this time to sit us near the open backdoor that patrons use to go to the bathroom and the waitstaff uses to hide in in between orders. It's January. So clearly this is a great idea. NOT.  I was so angry I almost walked out right then. I could understand if it was 8 p.m. and those free, better tables were being saved for someone. But it was late. We were the last customers of the night. Give us the best, free table, you idiot!  Anyhizzle, our waiter shows up and man is amazing. He reads us the whole menu, which usually I hate, but he was so charming, it was OK.  Loved him. Best part of the entire night.  So they start us with a complimentary  amuse-bouche, which was declicious. So second best part of the night. And that basically concludes are positives.  The bread was so boring I thought it was running for office.   My wine tasted as if the bottle had been opened the week before. When I complained ONLY because I was asked if I liked it, the amazing waiter brought me two other wines to try. Im telling you, best waiter ever. But the wines all tasted rancid. I didn't tell him this because I didn't want to be a jerk, so I just sipped happily cuz it is Vegas and the point is to drink, OK?  We started with the lobster bisque (I've tasted better lobster broth at Whole Foods and the lobster was hard) and a mushy tomato salad.   Then we shared some crazy 32-ounce ribeye that came with a puff pastry and bone marrow. I love marrow, but this was gross. And the ribeye had no taste at all. No salt. No pepper. Just grease. Where's the BAM, Emeril? Also, the steak was so hard and not medium rare, as we ordered it.   The waiter recommended the potatoes gratin. Dude, I've made better gratin drunk. The potatoes were still hard and it tasted like pure garlic. I love garlic, but this was like Buffy the Vampire Slayer killing a villian garlic.   So we left. The check wasn't bad for Vegas.   But for a special night out? Not worth your time.  I like StripSteak at Mandalay so much more. While it does have THE shittiest service, the steaks are like butter and the sides are to die for.",

I love the bone in ribeye medium rare,  and the fried chips are a must but make sure have them make it with no salt, the cheese flakes they put on top is already salty. Price is high since its inside casino thats the only reason I gave one less than perfect.",

    "text": "I really like Delmonico's.  I've dined here multiple times and have never been disappointed in either the service or the food.  We decided to have lunch here on our most recent Vegas excursion.  My dad tried to get reservations for noon, but was told that they could seat us at 12:30pm instead.  No biggie.  When we arrived, there were only about two other tables occupied.  Not sure why we couldn't come in at noon, but whatever.  We ordered the potato chips with truffle oil and parmesan as our app.  I never thought of potato chips as a gourmet dish, but now I know better.  Excellent!  My sister and I split the salmon which had a bbq-esque sauce and was served with onion strings.  The waiter actually asked how we would like to have our salmon prepared.  I've never had a waiter ask that before.  Pretty cool.  We also shared a side of broccoli (gotta eat your veggies) and the twice baked potato with white cheddar and bacon (OMG!).  So yummy!  For dessert we all split two of the infamous banana cream pies.  Can you say holy banana goodness?  Another OMG moment!  In all honesty, that pie is one of the main reasons we went to Delmonico's.  ;)  I would highly recommend dining at Delmonico's if you are in the neighborhood.  Be prepared for a leisurely meal (service can be slow, but it is relaxing) and some delicious food.  Bon appetit!",

Of the eight in our group - seven of us ordered the Bone-In Ribeye - the eighth ordered a Filet.  Bottom Line - Everyone Was Pleased.  The cuts were ample. The cooking-temperatures perfect. The flavor excellent. The texture exceptionally tender.  Of note also, was the table-side Caesar Salad. For sides we kept it simple - ordering fries and mushrooms - both were excellent. Another winner was the Banana Cream Pie.  Service overall was accommodating and highly attentive.   The room itself is a little bland - and the lighting system rather ugly - but hey - you're here for the steak!  Recommended!",

    "text": "Lets start with the fact that I pretty much have given up on fancy corporate owned pretentious restaurants years ago.  I prefer the owner operated versions where you can get top notch ingredients cooked expertly with love and care.  Isn't that what we really want when we dine out? In my case, yep.   I have been to several of Emerils restaurants in NOLA as well as the one in the MGM, and this was one fine, and to my surprise, a very fun expierence as well. From the time we walked in we had a hilarious encounter with the hostess.  She informed us that it was an hour wait for the dining room.  We didnt want to wait that long so she offered us the option of sitting at the bar.    Hmm, glanced over and observed a 60ish man and a bouffant haired woman sitting towards the end of the bar, a couple of empty seats to their left, but that was busy with a crowd of men milling about. I jokingly said to the hostess that was not a bad option, but that lady looked like the type that would be doused in perfume which would be a bit of a palate buzz kill. She stated that she was sensitive to that as she was allergic to perfume. I, again joking, suggested she stroll by and test the air.   She immediately walked towards the lady doing a perfect \"whistle past the graveyard\" stroll and raised her nose to the heavens as she passed the suspect. It was absolutely hilarous. Guess we couldnt leave after that, damn glad we stayed.   The other reviewers have already testified re; the awesome food, I definetly concur, but wanted to yelp about the personality of some of the staff. Oh, our bartendress/server was a joy as well.",

    "text": "Being that I am in real estate, I can't tell you how excited I was to be treated to a chi-chi expensive dinner that probably ended up costing the equivalent to what I budget for two weeks of groceries...per person, mind you!  I was in town for a work conference and one of our clients was gracious enough to invite all of his brokers to dinner.   I'm not much of a carnivore but..when in Rome! It would be plain dumb of me to choose fish in a place known for their steak. That would be like ordering a hamburger at a Chinese restaurant.  Here's the nitty gritty:  Starter:  Caesar Salad (made table side for 2): Shared w/ my co-worker. Best damn caesar salad I've ever had! They even mix the dressing fresh.  Main Entree: Filet Mignon - medium rare: I think I died and went to beef heaven. So tender. So perfectly seasoned. So perfectly cooked! I'd be tempted to convert to carnivor-ism if I could eat like this more often.  Sides (a la carte): We ordered a bunch for the table to share family style Creamed spinach - yum-o in my tum-o Sauteed garlic mushrooms - shroomerific Truffle Parmesan potato chips - the classiest chips on the block & a hit at the table. We fought over the chip with the most truffles.  Dessert (again, shared family style): Butterscotch pudding - not to sweet - just right but a taste was enough for me. Chocolate Brioche Bread Pudding - I liked all the layers and it wasn't overly rich   The service was absolutely impeccable. Water glasses were never allowed to go half empty - they were promptly refilled by super observant waiters with bottled water in hand. Whenever someone left their chair to use the restroom, they came back to their napkin, neatly refolded and they'll pull your chair out for you to sit.  I've never seen a more professional or attentive group - and that in itself justifies their high prices.  Come here and dine like royalty!",

    "text": "Given the big name attached to this place (Emeril), and based on a friend's recommendation, I had high hopes. Sadly, the name here is just a facade for mediocre food and service.  I made reservations via Yelp/OpenTable to treat my girl to a nice dinner on our first \"just us\" trip to Las Vegas.  It was a cold night and she had decided to wear a heavy coat. When we arrived, neither the host or hostess offered to take her coat. I then asked them to take her coat and they responded that Delmonico's doesn't offer a coat check. Strike one.  The hostess seated us at a table that had obviously already been reserved for us, as two of the chairs at the four-person table had been removed. That was a small, but nice touch.  I had expected Delmonico's to have a dress code, but there were plenty of patrons in jeans and polo shirts. I almost want to strike the restaurant for that, but I understand it is Vegas and they have to cater to a variety of customers. But it does take the ambiance down a notch.  The waiter appeared promptly and introduced himself (Renee, I believe it was). I had to ask for the wine list. Why should I have to *ask* for the wine list? Strike two.  Renee did not go over any of the specials with us. He also mentioned that two other servers would be assisting them, but he did so when they weren't there. So when one of them came by later, we had no idea which of the two assistants he was.  The assistant pretty much took over at that point, and we only saw Renee once again (with the bill). The assistant asked to take our order before we even saw the wine list.  This wasn't turning out to be the pampered, high-quality service that I had come to expect based on my experiences at other fine dining establishments.  Our food came out fairly quickly; almost too quickly. We had barely received the wine when our appetizers arrived. She had the lobster bisque which was very thin and only contained about 1oz of lobster. I had the duck prosciutto flatbread. The duck was overcooked and still had a layer of skin and fat that was rubbery.  Almost instantly after we finished our appetizers, the main entrees arrived as if they had been waiting around the corner with the dishes to spring out as we took the last bites of our appetizers.  She ordered the filet and I had the bone-in rib-eye. Both of the cuts were of good quality but were ruined by an over-seasoning of creole spices. Both steaks were ordered medium rare and came out cooked perfectly.  The sides left much to be desired. Many of the choices were bland and uninspiring. The broccoli was simply steamed with no seasoning or oils added. The potato gratin contained too much garlic.  The speed of the service and delivery of the meal was too fast. We finished dinner within 1 hour. Strike three.  Total damage, including wine ($120 for the bottle) and tip, came to ~$340. We've had much, much better fine dining experiences (and food) for less.  I would not recommend this place to anyone looking for a classy, upscale meal. It's just a touristy, over-priced restaurant with a celebrity chef's name tied to it.  There are many better options available in Vegas.",

    "text": "Five stars you ask? Yes I answer and don't ever doubt me again.   First let me mention they have one of the best wine lists in Vegas due to the Delmonico in Miami closing down and sending 500+ wines to this one in Vegas. Sorry that your other restaurant closed, Emeril, but thanks for the amazing wine.  For appetizers we had a sampler plate that consisted of BBQ shrimp, cold crab legs, and truffle oil potato chips. All three were great but the truffle oil potato chips were freaking amazing! These were the first chips I have had in years and I am so glad I chose these to break my no chip policy.   For main I went with the filet mignon very rare and it was delicious with the perfect amount of dry rub and no sauce, just the way I like it. Their sides are served family style and I love that. We had the wild mushrooms, creamed corn, asparagus, and garlic mashed potatoes.   Our dinner lasted three hours thanks to the amazing wine and they never once rushed us to leave. In fact, every time I came back to the table from the restroom (remember lots of wine) they had refolded my dinner napkin. Now that's some damn good service right there!   The ambiance is classy with all white walls, rounded ceilings and an open layout. Cheers",

This is not some crap you get at Marie Callender's or some other establishments, this is the best banana creme pie I have ever had.  Yes it is that good.

If you ever go to Vegas and want to take your wife, fiance, girlfriend, mother or mistress to an unbelievable experience - take them there.  It was my Anniversary and my wife and I went to the Venetian for our big meal.  When we arrived, the hostess greeted us with a \"Happy Anniversary\" and sent us into the lounge for a drink on the house.  When our table was ready, they brought us into the dining room - where I see Tom Brady and Giselle Bunchen.  I nod to Tom, and he shoots me with his finger gun.  It was great!!  So we sit down, I am glowing - I learn that we have the best service ever coming our way. Our bus boy and two waiters were waiting for us with a free little sample appetizer for our Anniversary.  The dinner was splendid - it is an Emeril owned restaurant afterall.  We had a very memorable Banana Foster Bread Pudding with Cookies and Cream.  Best dessert ever.    I highly recommend Delmonico Steakhouse to anyone looking for a nice meal for a special occasion.  Great food, perfect service.  Five Stars!",

    "text": "I had a late-ish dinner around 9 here on Friday the 28th of July after seeing Phantom at the Venetian because the restaurant was close to the theater. I noticed there was a piano in the waiting room but no one was playing it; instead they were blasting the sportscast on the TV which soured the mood. Once seated the atmosphere was largely pleasant but also a bit too loud and some of the staff seemed uncertain and nervous. Our head server in particular was not enjoying himself at all and was visibly annoyed by the group across from our table which was loitering around the restaurant for a long time after finishing their meal.   The meal itself was very good, especially my Bone-in-Ribeye which is their signature cut. It's a slightly glazed and massive piece of meat, rubbed with a Cajun sauce that gave it zest and even a bit of spice. It paired beautifully with the Bourbon-Bacon Manhattan I ordered at the bar. My dining companion had the New York strip which was fine but not nearly as memorable as the Bone-in. Like the cuts of the meat, the sides are probably too big and one side is more than enough for 2 people. However both of the sides we had (The Wild Mushrooms and the Spinach) were delicious so it would be difficult to pick one. The appetizers were relatively standard, with the exception of the Parmesan-Truffle Chips but be forewarned that delicious as they are they are very filling and quite greasy.",

The service was  outstanding and so was the food. My sister and I had to split a T-bone steak because it was so big. We devoured it in about 3 minutes because it just melted. It was seasoned perfectly and the side orders we picked came in generous portions (we had to take them home).  My grandfather loved the salad he kept saying it was exactly what he was craving. It was the first time I'd eaten a correctly made caesar and it was extremely well flavored. Everyone was so stuffed and we had tons of food left over. As I stated before the service was outstanding I day this because my grandfather started feeling pain and needed to be taken home to have his medication immediately. They let half of us leave to escort him to our ride and we hadn't even paid or bill. They discreetly packed up or food and took our payment after they were sure his situation was handled, they even offered to have security bring a wheel chair and escort us out the Venetian. That was the last Christmas meal I will ever share with him because he recently passed away but thanks to the understanding, kindness, and professionalism of the staff I will forever have a beautiful memory.",

The bone in ribeye was delicious, as you would expect there was a lot of fat on it but the flavor was worth it.    The bone in filet (a special) was very good, tender, less fat than the rib eye but also less flavor.    I would say both are worth getting but it depends on your preference for flavor vs. tenderness.    The duck was very good - not fatty as most duck is but still full of flavor - if you are looking for a non steak entre I think this is the way to go.  I didn't have one so I cannot confirm but someone I was dining with said the mojito was the best they have ever had so keep that in mind if you are a mojito fan.  Overall a great dinner.",

The waitress was SO nice, despite us being completely out of our element. This place is super fancy, and we are more of the bar and grill-type frequenters. Also, when we called and made a reservation, we told them we were on our honeymoon. They brought us a mini-appetizer on the house and congratulated us, which was a nice touch.",

Classy, noise level wasn't too high, they even help the ladies with their chair when they sit. Big list of wine choices and they have huge cuts of rib-eye. Full bar you can order drinks from when you first enter the restaurant.  My first time I came with 2 other friends, I believe I ordered the bone-in Ribeye, which is unbelievably HUGE. It was literally bigger than my face. I got my ribeye in medium rare, and came out to be just right. Lots of butter, and we also ordered a couple sides. Picked out a bottle of wine which was the perfect topping to our fatty peices of steak.  They also serve dinner rolls! Warm and soft, and lots of butter =]  I came back in recent March and ordered a smaller cut, also in medium rare but it wasn't as good as my first time here. Ate here with one other person, he ordered filet mignon which was very tender. We each ordered a glass of wine, although I'd rather choose a bottle instead next time as there are more choices of wine. Also had the lobster bisque, which I absolutely LOVE, so creamy but it was a little thin. Not too many pieces of lobster meat either. Ordered one side, a baked potato which was a little on the dry side.  There was a small fly that kept flying around us during dinner... It ended up in my water...  Had creme brulee for dessert, they also serve homemade madeleine cookies with the creme brulee, both were very good.",

Lunch service was ok...you can tell the difference from the dinner service.  But the food was good still.  I did want to try the lobster sliders....some one else go that and it looked pretty good...you get 2 sliders.  I had the pasta dish during lunch but the flavors was a bit bland and the dish was forgetable.",

    "text": "Let me start off by saying that I am a huge foodie LOVE all of Emerils restaurants. I started off by ordering the wilted spinach salad with bacon vinaigrette that was absolutely to die for that I ended up licking the plate. They also did a very cool soft-boiled egg that was then fried and one of the first I'd ever seen and pull it off perfect.  My main dish was perfectly cooked and super tasty ( the barbecued salmon dish).  It was served on top of a bacon potato hash and I ordered the cream corn as a side dish.  Yum yum yum!!!  I wanted to put that potato hash in my pocket and take it home!. I would highly recommend this for anyone coming in and if my review were only based on this then I would give it a five star!  Unfortunately it's not...The other four people in our party decided to order steaks and all of them disliked them...I am from Texas so I never make the mistake of ordering a steak outside of Texas because I am almost always let down.  Our server was mean and did not do her job well. She seemed that it was almost more of an annoyance when we wanted to order anything!  I hate to say it but come on, You're in Vegas as a high end server....The wait time in between drink orders seemed extremely longer than normal and when the manager finally came over to address the steaks, he did nothing....Even though my food was perfect the whole experience was just off-putting and The Decour of the restaurant needs a major overhaul. Bland and boring....I also found it very unprofessional that they had about 15 chairs stacked in the hallway between the restaurant on your way to the bathroom....anyway I hate giving this restaurant only two stars but I want everybody to know...",

They served us a complimentary tomato mousse on a puff pastry to start and for being a single bite, it was packed full of flavor! I knew we were in for a treat. Ordered steak tartare for an appetizer and fell in love. It comes with an egg yolk over the top which gives it a wonderful velvety taste. Decent portion although I could have eaten much more. Next we shared the tomato and burrata salad. The burrata was the best I've had....so creamy and rich. Delicious! For our entree, we shared the Chateaubriand. Holy crap was it amazing! The first bite literally melted in my mouth. It's served with asparagus which was super fresh and crisp. We substituted fingerling potatoes for the mashed potatoes and were very happy with our decision. We also added foie gras, which was delicious. I seriously could eat the steak ever day though.... It's one of the best I've ever had. For dessert, we were interested in the bread pudding but went with the suggestion of 2 different servers and ordered the pecan pie. Holy shit it was incredible. Not your typical pecan pie....it's made with oats and love and magic. It was the perfect end to a fantastic meal. We come to Vegas and splurge on a nice dinner once a year, typically going somewhere new each time, but there's a chance we'll make a repeat visit next year. The service was on point throughout...the staff is knowledgeable and friendly, not stuffy or arrogant at all like some places. Thank you, Delmonico!",

We walked over here on saturday night around 6 to start the night off right with a good steak dinner. This place came highly recommended from a friend.   The restaurant was overly amazing. It was clean and dimly light like most steak places. The waiters were knowledgeable and prompt with their service. I got kind of a pretentious vibe from our waiter which was a little off putting. But it didnt bother me too much.  I ordered the Filet Mignon medium rare and it was cooked to perfection. I was very impressed. The steak was soft and flavorful and melted in my mouth. The side dishes were just ok. We ordered broccoli, creamed spinach, and fingerling potatoes. I wasnt impressed by the sides all that much. Not extremely flavorful but still decent.  We also ordered a $200 bottle of wine which was the most expensive wine i have drank before. I didnt know much about it, the winery was called Mastery and it was a red wine. My bro ordered it not me and it was really good! It was listed on the last page of the wine menu and was $40 a glass, but we ordered a bottle for the table. i wish i figured out what wine it was but it was really really good.  This is a good spot for a vegas dinner and a great way to start the night! i would definitely check out some other places before i come back here but i recommend it!",

The food: We started off with the shrimp, which was wonderful, and the bread was warm and soft.  It was a bit salty for my taste, but that's just me.  We then had the spinach salad, which was wonderful!  For entrees, I had the crab stuffed lobster and the wife had the filet.  The lobster was great; the filet was nothing special.  For dessert, we had a sorbet and the cheesecake; both were quite good.  The waiters/staff: If I had to use one word, it would be disinterested. The waiter was good, but the other (why were there two?) just seemed to be reading a script and literally had to read his notes on the available dessert flavors.  The wife had informed them it was my 50th birthday, but when the dessert came out it said \"Happy Anniversary\".  We jokingly noted the error and the waiter said we didn't appear to be old enough to be married for 50 years, but he went with what he was told.  We didn't blame him at all and left a generous tip. This error underscore their lack of attention and appearance of just going through the motions.  So, overall, it was OK, but not great.  We've had better steaks, and FAR better service (Ferraro's Italian Restaurant waiter was the BEST) for much less cost.",

At $85 the price is a bit of a turn off and there are other nice cuts available around a $50 range. Although, at 32 oz and being one of the best steaks I ever had in my life it was well worth it. Service was also fairly good although not superb. Very professional staff but during the busy dinner hours are not the most attentive.

It's usually just because nothing overwhelmed me, or I was too lazy to do so - I'm trying to be better about that! My husband and I went to Las Vegas last week for our first year anniversary to get a way for a few days. We always try and scout out new restaurants. This was definitely our favorite meal - hands down! The entire experience was great -- they brought out a small treat for us to start, then we both had amazing bourbon cocktails, and then dove into the delicious food. I got the Filet Mignon, but prepared Piedmontese style which is just seasoning, olive oil, roasted garlic, and rosemary - it was cooked perfectly (medium) and super tender and had great flavoring. It didn't need any sauce! My husband got the bone-in ribeye which they are known for I believe - I had a few bites and it was fantastic. The au gratin potatoes were also good and not overly heavy like some can be. Our wine was great as well, Stag's Leap. The BEST part of the experience though was our waiter Rene. He was so attentive, fun to talk to, and just wanted us to enjoy ourselves. He really made this experience special. I also have some dietary restrictions and I've never seen a restaurant be so attentive to them. It really put me at ease. Next time you're in Vegas, GO HERE. We'll be returning for New Year's this year and have already recommended it to some friends going out later this month!",

Offensive and unacceptable.  The hostess ran in one direction and a staff member told us we would have to make our way back up to the front to deal with this issue when we told them that this would not work for us.  After a word with someone who claimed to be the manager at the front, we were reseated and promptly given complimentary truffle chips (that can solve any bad first impression).  The truffle chips are not to be missed.    Service-  Our server eventually warmed up and was pleasant.   He was so caught up in his speeches about different parts of the menu and recommendations, that it took some time to see his True personality.  He was also rushed, which was odd, as we had some menu questions.    Food-  The filet was magical.  This is the primary reason that the restaurant got 4 stars.  The creole seasoning and dab of BUTTER on the steak were an amazing and sinful treat.  Really delicious.  The cheese grits were delicious.  I was a bit less impressed with the creamed spinach.  The waiter said that it was better than CUT's version.  NO WAY!  Underwhelming.",

We finally remembered how it happened - we were at the Palazzo and she wanted steak. I wanted to stop at Cut, but she wasn't a big fan of Wolfgang Puck. She likes Mario Batali, so we glanced over Enoteca's menu, but of course - they didn't have steak. If we'd known of the existence of Carnevino, we probably would've ended up there. I don't know if the steak would've been better..... but anyway, this is about Delmonico.   By the time we ended up in front of Delmonico's Steakhouse, we really were famished. It's Emeril's steakhouse - couldn't possibly be awful.............  We ordered: * A BOTTLE OF RED * JUMBO LUMP CRAB CAKE          - [4/5 - Good crab cakes - not the best, but definitely took first place over everything else we had.] * GRILLED FILET MIGNON MEDALLIONS          - [3/5 - It was alright. Average in flavor, not tender.] * FILET MIGNON          - [2/5 - She's a huge steak fan but first, they overcooked her steak - then sent her a second steak, which was still not much better and a little chewy.]",

Husband and I knew we were both going to order steak before we even looked at the menu.     I ordered the ribeye with country smashed potatoes and husband got the filet mignon with creamed corn.   The side were served family style and were more than enough for two people.   The creamed corn was fantastic.  It had little bits of jalapeno in it for the extra BAM!    We both ordered the lobster bisque to start.   Bisque was very delicious especially the lumps of lobster meat.   Did you know during the summer the bisque is dairy free?    The steaks were just okay.  Asked for mine medium but it came out well done so I didn't find it that good.  Husband also asked for medium but basically got a rare steak.     Overall though the atmosphere was definitely upscale yet comfortable.  I want to compliment our waitress ...she was very friendly and fun.   Check was $164 dollars for two people.",

I had two dirty martinis, which were mixed to perfection. Also they included 3 olives (odd numbers only acceptable in mixed drinks) without me having to ask for an odd number. I don't get picky when bar tenders don't know this about mixed drinks, but I sure do appreciate it when bar tenders do!  Their bread is light and lovely as well, which should be noted because you won't get full when treating yourself to some pre-entree goodness.  I ordered their twice baked potato which was creamy and delicious beyond belief. I also tried their creamy spinach which was a lovely touch to my meal.  For dessert, I asked the server to suggest a dessert liquor and she brought me Licor 43. Highly recommend this booze too, but I appreciate the server knowing what to suggest. I also ordered their coconut ice cream for dessert, which was obviously as delicious as the rest of my meal. The best part is, the ice cream wasn't sugary. It just tasted like the flavor I ordered, without it feeling like there was sugar paste residue after eating it. An amazing place, with amazing servers and better food. Cheers!",

Tomato Bisque soup with a dollop of cream: OH MY GOODNESS. So creamy and absolutely delicious 2. Filet of beef medallions: The juiciest and most tender pieces of beef you'll ever find topped with mushrooms & bread crumbs, apple bacon, parmesan cheese and a special home made sauce *insert tears of happiness*  3. Delmonico's prime hamburger: Oh my oh my. Served on a toasted brioche roll with cheddar cheese and bacon and accompanied by a bed of fries... this burger is unlike your average joe one. It's hearty, juicy, tender and foodgasmic. Do yourselves a major favor and include this as one of your entrees.  4. Emeril's banana cream pie: After all of the steak and appetizers, my stomach was literally about to burst from fullness. However, at the taste of this pie, I was somehow able to stretch my pants to new heights and devour the whole pie. Thank goodness my bf and I ordered our own desserts because he just wouldn't have gotten any otherwise.  5. The pinot noir I ordered was the perfect complement to all of the above, taking my palette to new extremes. Unfortunately, I can't remember the name, but I do remember that it was from Sonoma and I ordered it by the glass.   We also had the lobster bisque and the BBQ shrimp as appetizers. While they were phenomenal as well, they were a mere 5 stars in comparison to the 6-7 star dishes above. So basically, you can't lose by ordering anything at Delmonico's.   Happy Eating, Yelpers!",

The heirloom tomatoes and burrata were a nice starter. But our overall experience was of a place we'd not return to. When you pay over $40 for a steak, it should be delicious.",

So, my fiance booked us a trip and made it happy (love him).  We arrived and was seated right away.  We had our first experience of a  two person wait staff attending to us.  The meal was superb.  I had salmon and sides and my fiance had the rib eye and sides.  The meal was flawless.  We had good conversation with the wait staff to the point where when we discussed how we were from MD, he introduced us to another staff member (who wanted to meet us because she was from our area too).  We had great conversation.  I usually don't get dessert when I'm out because I'm usually too stuffed to do so, but the wait staff insisted and comped it because it was my birthday.  Just to mention, we had to change our initial reservation time and I was worried thinking we wouldn't be accommodated but we did so with no issues.  This restaurant is located in the Venetian Hotel and depending on where you come in at, may take a little while to get to.  The other part of the place that was hard to navigate to was the restrooms, it was to the right of the seating area down the hall and if I remember correctly, you pass by/can see inside of the kitchen on the way.",

I eat here anytime I'm in the city.  The service is always top notch and the food has consistently been delicious.  You really can't go too wrong with their menu.  The waitstaff assigned to your table are very helpful when you ask about the various dishes.  I typically go with steak when I eat here.  They have always been cooked to perfection.  On my last visit, I had the grilled filet mignon medallions served with the mushroom crust, bacon and cheese.  I'm also a fan of the filet mignon served oscar style as well.  Both excellent.

No need to temperature down when being asked in anticipation of the kitchen cooking the crap out of your steak, what you ask for is what you get.  I was here was some buddies for a random Vegas trip and we decided to do it big at Delmonico.  The experience was great.  The ambiance is a little bit more on the \"date night\" side of the spectrum, but the service is awesome and the steaks and sides are delicious.    Make reservations and don't stress about the price, it's a special occasion.  Even if it's not a special occasion, it will be when you steak comes at exactly the right temperature.",

    "text": "***This review is only for the cocktails in the lounge***  Whether you spell it \"whiskey\" or \"whisky\", Carol W and I have been long time lovers of this brown spirit in all of its forms.  Therefore, it was a logical imperative that we check out Delmonico Steakhouse and its vaunted whiskey collection.  We got there around 9:30 on a Thursday night and the place was largely empty as the restaurant was nearing the end of its service for the night.  As a side mission, we wanted to also check out the much-mentioned \"secret\" menu of whiskey-based cocktails created and crafted by Delmonico's lead barman, Max Solano.  Max possesses encyclopedic knowledge of whiskey and is personable and passionate about what he does and if he isn't busy, is very willing to impart some of his knowledge discussing the finer points of whiskey and his whiskey program.  As the curator of Delmonico's whiskey collection, he's assembled the most comprehensive lineup of whiskeys I've ever seen to include hundreds of ultra high quality, hard to find, or never heard of before brands from around the world.  As a personal aside, did they have Pappy Van Winkle?  Yes, of course,...the ENTIRE frickin' Pappy product line and it was on the shelf, not out of stock like so many other places that have it listed on their menu!  I was so tempted to get the Pappy whiskey flight, but on this visit, I was even more intrigued by the secret menu of cocktails.    Delmonico has a standard (but very intriguing looking) cocktail menu consisting of classics and originals that all of the bartenders can prepare.  However, only Max knows how to craft the secret menu cocktails.  I had the Don's Orders made with Templeton Rye and the Smoked Bluff made with Glenmorangie 12 yr. and both were complex, boozy with subtle sweetness, yet completely balanced.  Simply put, Max's secret menu cocktails were hands down the best treatment of whiskey in a cocktail form that I've yet consumed.  If you love whiskey, then the Delmonico Steakhouse is a must!  The next time for us?  We may even get around to trying the food!",

My husband liked to lobster but said the crab mixture had too much mayo (?). My ribeye cut was too fatty and didn't need the butter. I felt like I was eating a rib eye from Paula Dean's kitchen.   For, dessert, we ordered the macadamia nut bread pudding. Uh, meh, nothing spectacular.  The italian espresso was very good.

    "text": "Prior to our trip, a few of us wanted to do a steak dinner in Vegas and we agreed on Delmonicos. Delving into the menu so I had an idea in mind of what I would be ordering, I became intrigued immensely when I saw that it was under Emeril's.  We were fortunate to be seated a little early. The ambiance of course evokes an intimate and formal setting with the dim lighting. The decor was minimal and I felt there could have used some art pieces.  Let me say the service was top-notch. Although it is what you'd expect from such an establishment, very few places achieve such high marks IMO. The water glasses were never empty and it felt like we didn't really have a server but a rotation of different people that comprised the waitstaff. I counted at least 6 different people between taking our order, serving the appetizers, the main course, side dishes, wine, filling the waters and dessert.   Appetizer: Ahi Tuna & Salmon Tartare: Superb. I liked how the cucumber salad complemented the tuna & salmon and came in a spiraled form. The wonton chips were crispy and a nice form used for stacking the tartare & salad on. The wasabi provided a nice bite and offered a different note with the tartare.   Main Course: Ribeye (no-bone). Some say the meat tastes better on the bone. In this case I found the Ribeye to be succulent, juicy well seasoned and cooked to perfection. Frankly I don't think it would have made much of difference if it was on the bone or not based on the flavor. Adding on the butter on top was a nice feature to the steak.   Sides: All the sides were delicious and was about the right amount to share for 3 (4 if the people aren't big eaters.   Potato Gratin: So good I couldn't stop eating it.   Creamed Spinach: No joke and the right balance of cream to tone down the strong taste of spinach was harmonic.   Asparagus: I'm not an asparagus fan but if asparagus always tasted this good, it might crack my top 3 favorite vegetables. Had the right amount of salt and seasoning to create a more palatable asparagus.   Dessert: Sorbet; 3 scoops, 3 flavors. Strawberry, Banana and the 3rd resembled Coconut. I found the sorbet to be a more suitable and lighter offering vs. if it was an ice cream or gelato. Clean flavors and the banana was surprisingly interesting given the fact its not something one often comes across.",

It didn't look crowded from the outside, but once we went back into the dining area, we were shocked by how huge it is and how crowded it was.  We had a lovely table and great service.  But more importantly, seriously stellar food.  Per usual in my world, my group ordered a bunch of things to share.  (I don't know why everyone doesn't do this- it just makes dining so much more fun).  ORDER THE FILET MIGNON!!! The seasoning is insanely delicious- sort of a creole/Cajun/NOLA seasoning profile that danced in my mouth.  High quality, beautiful cut of steak, perfectly cooked with a unique flavor profile-- how can you go wrong??  Also, our awesome server sliced it for us to make it easy to share-- loved that!!   The salmon was also perfectly cooked and delicious.  The hash underneath was great too, and played well with the fish seasoning.  The mushrooms side is OUTSTANDING!  If you are a mushroom lover, these are some don't-miss shroomies.  We also got the buttered broccoli.  It is totally simple and tasted like what you'd have at home, but with such a heavy and strong flavored meal, this was some spot on, solid freshness, too.  No complaints from me!!  I also would be remiss not to point out the flakey, fresh, OMG-good bread that they serve.  So light and airy, so so worth the calories.  This is definitely a restaurant I will return too- which is saying a lot in Vegas where the food is just too good!",

The decor and architecture of the restuarant is unique and modern; it really provides a class of it's own.  The service was superb; not in your face, but they didn't leave you hanging in terms of wanting.  The steak was perfect.  Enough said.  You want a good steak, you expect a good steak, and they deliver a great steak.  Their wine selection is above standard, and the servers are well educated on assisting you.

    "text": "We were disappointed with several things.  The time between ordering and our being served the first course was 30 minutes.  The cavernous dining room was so cold, I could see my breath.  After the slow appetizers, our main course took 60 minutes to be served.  Two of us ordered the bone-in filet, both cooked medium rare.  Mine arrived with heavy spices, while the other diners' filet was more aggressively spiced, to the point it had to be sent back for a new steak.  Perhaps this special item was supposed to be spiced up more than a typical filet, but even between the two of us it was inconsistent.  Then the waitstaff disappeared again.  Our 3-course meal for 3 people took over 3 hours.  Asparagus was well prepared, and the Caesar Salad was superb.  But vegetables do not a steakhouse make.  There are other steakhouses at Venetian / Palazzo that have better service and consistently prepared meat.    The cavernous design contributed to a loud atmosphere, making conversation difficult -- not just between diners but with the waitstaff.  Our lead server had to ask twice for us to repeat our selection.  I can't recommend this place, nor do I plan to return.",

What cost the restaurant a better rating was how we were greeted by the host staff.  While I was checking in, the hostess turned away to seat someone that just walked up as I was giving my name.  I was so surprised and offended that I was prepared to leave.  Another host saw this and quickly jumped in and had us seated right away.  Kudos to him for the save, but still there was no apology issued.  First impressions are important.  We never expected anything like this at a restaurant of this caliber, especially one associated with Emeril Lagasse.",

Given all of the available steakhouse options in LV, the prime location inside The Venetian, the $$$$ price point and Celebrity Chef, you would think Delmonico's would set the standard.   I must admit that I am a big fan of the grand dining room associated with most steakhouses.  The \"room\" we sat last night was as interesting as a high school banquet hall.   We ordered the \"signature\" bone in Ribeye for $60 and Seared Big Eye Tuna Salad.  Both were not flavorful and overpriced, even by Vegas standards.  The \"pop overs\" were cold and not fresh.  The best item was $14 mushrooms.  If you are looking for a great classic steakhouse in Vegas, I would look right past Delmonico's.",

CUT has been my absolute favorite place for steak and fine dining for the past five years but we decided to try somewhere new for once.  Food (4): The food was great but I wasn't blown away. I didn't leave the restaurant replaying every bite. We ordered the heirloom tomato soup (with grilled cheese sandwich), mac and cheese, crab legs, and two steaks. I got the special steak of the day that came with shaved pieces of truffle on top. Don't get me wrong. Everything was delicious and I had no problem with my food, but it just wasn't memorable.   Ambiance (3.5): It's a fancy restaurant but felt like any other bougie restaurant inside of a Vegas hotel. We were seated at a corner table but there definitely could have been some more space between us and the pair next to us.  Service (4): Service was also a positive experience. Our waiter was pleasant and friendly and made small talk with us. And when my date found a long curly hair mixed into his crab legs, the waiter apologized and took it back without a second thought. When he came back with a new plate the legs looked like they came from the fattest crabs possible.  So overall, a wonderful experience and I would have no qualms about returning. But CUT remains my favorite steak restaurant.",

We booked it and headed down from the room to get some steaks...  Hostess A+ sat us down and gave us menu and said server would be with us in a second:  Server asked what drinks and then informed us that we needed to make a make a decision quickly as the kitchen was closing... Sooooo y have a 2pm option of ur kitchen is going to close 5 minutes into getting seated? Not a good way to start off the meal...  Now onto food  Ordered BBQ shrimp app.... Great option very good sauce and very unique maybe it had a lil but if Emerills BAM....  Gumbo bowl also amazing sauce was best gumbo so far ever  Cesar salad was ehh.... Wouldn't get it again  I had bone in NY strip medium rare... Cooked and season to perfection and that dollop of sauce on top tasty  Table had 2 Bone in rib eyes also very good and one had steak salad which is prob one of the better steak salads  to date  Mushrooms side dish best one of all steakhouses ever visited and I've been to a lot!  Oohhhh and those popovers for the table abloom very good especially with the BBQ sauce from the shrimp  Desert was chocolate cake with pistachio ice cream very very good  Also the other desert was the butter cake which was also very good  Best part of the meal was he Sommelier he was very interesting to talk to and very good service and wine recommendation.... If you go ask him for his advice def won't let you down...  Till next time Vegas ohhhh and change this lame kitchen closes soon thing ...because I may have wanted a 2nd steak",

    "text": "I'll start with this: I'm not a fan of Emeril Lagasse.  Why? I don't know. I've never really been a fan. When Food Network showed actual shows instead of Guy Fieri and his 90's hair, Emeril, Bobby Flay, Tyler Florence, and Giada ruled the network. Oh, and Michael Chiarello, but I've been to his restaurant and that was phenomenal. That aside, BAM! was the most popular saying in the food world, people flipped their shit over it, and now Emeril has his face on every cheaply made saucepan and spice around grocery stores for twice the markup. I always thought he was off-putting.  That being said, this is a seafood/steakhouse, and it's upscale. I've been to CUT, so I know that Wolfgang Puck is better than his canned soups. There's a chance Emeril would live up to the (very pricey) hype.  The drinks were good - a cab and a pinot noir were actually quite nice, and the cocktails looked amazing. Maybe your bar staff can teach your kitchen staff a little something about pride in their product.  First up: the vine-ripened heirloom tomato salad with burrata. Am I supposed to eat through the thick, rock hard center of this tomato? Are you serious? I paid $20+ for a salad that consisted of five slices of heirloom tomato and a dollop of burrata on top, and you're going to give me several slices that were pure unripened tomato? Fuckin hell. I was disappointed. Okay? So disappointed. Come on, how fucking hard is it to serve a RIPE tomato?  For the entree we ordered the wagyu ribeye and the ahi tuna. The tuna was fine - it was tuna. I'd opt for two pieces, as pepper crusted seared ahi for me can get overwhelming after a while (nigiri is a totally different situation). The battered mushrooms were a nice touch, as well as the sauce.  But the wagyu. Okay, look. You're paying $90 for a fucking steak. For a steak that ISN'T KOBE - please, for the love of god, don't confuse the two. And it's not big, it's small. Is it wonderfully marbled with fat? Yes! To me, it was great! I thought it was wonderful! But this is why my review just went down a star while writing this:  When you pay $90 for a goddamn steak, you'd better bring it out hot. Like, searing hot. Like on a 400F plate like Mastros, hot. RIGHT off the goddamn pan hot. When it comes out just barely hot anymore, and then slips right into lukewarm, what the fuck? What kind of $90 experience is that? The cow has given it's life, with the production of so many people trying to make it wonderful, and you RUIN the experience. Plus it was a little too salty.  You're probably thinking, \"Jesus Jaime, you're a bit of a prick, and a snob. I can see your brain from how high you're holding your nose from here.\"  Yeah, alright. I'll give you that. But you know what? I'm not going to pay fucking $90 for a goddamn steak if it isn't treated PERFECTLY. I can get a $25 steak that's handled better than that, I don't give a fuck if it hasn't been drinking beer all its life.  Then, to top off the evening of great disappointments, I ordered dessert. How HARD is it to fuck this up? When you have a great meal, you want to finish it with a bang, right? So you have the one thing on the menu people like (apparently the banana cream pie), and then fuck it to the rest of the dessert menu, right? For fucks sake people, GREAT dessert isn't that hard! It's SO EASY. Even worse, it's the biggest profit maker! If you call that Chocolate Truffle Cake a CAKE when it's drier than the Sahara desert, and that Strawberry Shortcake as such when there was barely any actual shortcake, AND the strawberries were mostly unripened with green parts on them, with a dollop of whipped cream on the side of the plate...then you should send your Pastry Chef back to school because clearly they need a kick in the ass.  This is an expensive meal where they prey off the idea that the people who come don't have any appreciation for the things they serve, so their level of care goes right out the 37th floor window of any hotel on the Strip.",

Steak was too buttery and oily.  Was not as memorable as the first time to make me want to come back again with so many other options in Vegas.  The ambiance is nice.  Service impeccable.",

The sides were very good (really loved the mushrooms) and leave room for the banana cream pie.   Great service, staff willing to help you with their extensive wine list and the bar served great drinks.   I did think it was pricey though - there are many other excellent steak houses in Vegas so it' really doesn't stand out. Not to damn them with faint praise of course.",

First off the bread ... if you do not know now to make a simple bread ... how hard it is ... even my homemade bread taste better than that hard piece of rock they served.  Maybe it was just a bad day for me. But it cannot be that bad right. nooo ... but sorry to say ... it is a yes for me. Waiter ... service ... zero! rude and didn't ask if we are done and took everything away ... but the food was bad anyways take it away as fast as you can. Jumbo shrimp and petite fiilet mignon ... non fresh shrimp made for bad combo plus ... I ordered medium rare and it came out well done. hmm ... either the waiter doesn't know how to write his order or the head chef or whoever is cooking is just as bad as emeril lagasse himself.  Then to coffee ... argh ... disgusting ... and we were like complaining and the waiter came by and asked ... we can brew a fresh one for you??? ... i was like WTF ... this was not a fresh brew to began with ... argh disgusting and chills all over my body ... so time to get out pronto!!!  The only good thing that came out of this is the wine we ordered ... they have an extensive selection and kudos for that ...   But I am never going back ... $55 for the entree ... I rather go to McD and I know what I am getting for $5.50.  Thank you Dad who said that my cooking with a costco steak is better than whatever they whipped up at demonic ... haa haa.",

    "text": "Came here with friends for our high end streak meal during a recent week in Vegas. It did not disappoint. For drinks, I ordered a High West rye Manhattan and it arrived perfectly mixed; maybe the smoothest Manhattan I've ever imbibed. Ceaser salad very good, but no anchovies. Two of us split chateaubriand and it was perfect, although presentation was somewhat boring. The potatos and asparagus were good but not spectacular. Another friend got the fillet and it was so tender she started cutting it with get butter knife and didn't even notice! The wine list is overwhelming. 93 pages. It's better to know what you want and see  if it's there than to try and choose. The decor is somewhat vanilla, but nice.  Also, the place is huge - much larger inside than what you see when you walk in off Restaurant Row in The Palazzo.  The crowd made for pretty fun people watching; there seemd to be a lot of middle aged men with their much younger \"dates.\"  Maybe it was \"take your niece to dinner\" night.  But overall, a very nice, entertaining  evening out, but spendy.",

    "text": "Maybe it's the media hyped downturned economy or maybe D's was having a bad Friday night but......this isn't the same Delmonico's I've experienced for many years prior (pre-yelp and post-yelp).    12 people again dined as we do every year at Delmonico's around the same time of the year and everyone I think felt it was not entirely the same restaurant.     Service: Great service as always but noticeably reduced in staff size, not as sharp (forgot my Voss that I ordered with my meal - $20 water you better remember it)  Ambiance: Not a lot of people in the restaurant for a prime hour on a Friday night.  Everyone seemed a little sullen.   Wine: Malbec recommended by Sommelier... not good, expensive, tasting notes didn't match the True flavor... the server had to notice nobody drinking it.  Food:  Truffled Chips:  They were good, truffle oil evident and tastey Amuse Bouche:  Flank Steak + peanut oil, a little overcooked, free Wedge:  Watery blue cheese dressing, salty... had better Lobster Bisque Soup:  Fishy, thick, sub-par  Bone In Ribeye:  Didn't taste anything like the previous years, possible downgraded steaks?  No earthy taste to the palate, thinner chop than normal.  Foie Gras served over steak made the steak better and could of eaten the FG by itself.   Filet:  good, again tasted downgraded, maybe Choice + Oscar side:  good and very tastey Lobster:  not recommended by waiter but it was good, actually the better of the entrees....strange right? Desserts (we eat a lot of this)  Birthday cake.... the fudge frosting was good but the cake sucked Blueberry Cobbler:  awesome!!  this is always good Banana Cream Pie:  ehh....only half eaten Key Lime Tart:  overly sugary and made my teeth hurt, it had a strange sugar taste...didn't remind me of key lime anything... sent back.  Last 4-5 years I gave 5 stars and would of given 6 if possible... this year was a 3, nothing memorable but an expensive bill.  I hope this economy turns around or what ever it is and I can enjoy my Delmonicos next year at what I've known it to be.",

I had heard good things, but was disappointed at virtually every turn:  Appearance - the place is falling apart.  tiles falling out of walls, holes in walls, dirty bathrooms, uncomfortable and awkward seating.  Service - mediocre.  Had to ask repeatedly for items, waiter disappeared for 20+ minutes at a time.    Food - decent; worthy of a 3 star, but the rest drags the rating down.  My filet was cooked to order and seasoned well.  When I ask for anchovies for my caesar salad though, I don't mean 'the anchovy paste you use in the dressing is adequate.'  It means I would like actual anchovies.  This isn't rocket surgery, delmonico.  All in all, anywhere else this would have rated a 3 star experience, but given both the price (in general, and relative to other steakhouses in vegas), and the sheer overabundance of steakhouses per capita in LV, there's no way this should rate highly on anyone's list.   Bad form, Delmonico.",

The bad: we received NY strips instead of rib-eyes and steak not impressive at all; did not taste like it was a prime cut - too lean and very little flavor, although foie gras was cooked perfectly.

Three of us celebrating St Patrick's Day, March Madness, and 40th birthdays all rolled into one weekend, decided to enjoy a dinner at Delmonico's.    From the moment we checked in, fantastic service.  Our server, Michael, was gracious, professional, funny, and more than willing to tolerate and participate in our banter, but never in an obtrusive way.  The food was outstanding- the ribeye was perfectly cooked, and the creamed corn gratin was downright amazing.   Great wine selection, excellent service (have I mentioned the service), and a great pecan pie with some glasses of port.  This was a great dinner, and an experience I will appreciate for a long time, and worth every penny of the $200 per head that we paid.",

    "text": "When I was looking for a place for dinner for my birthday celebration weekend, this place wasn't really high on my list. When it comes to purses, shoes and sometimes clothes, I'll put down a pretty penny or hundred for nice stuff. But when it comes to food, I think to myself, \"Is it really worth the cost to put something in only to have it come out?\"   In this case, \"Yes!\" Okay... Sort of...   I ordered the boneless Ribeye and a side of broccoli. Ribeye was good - just enough flavor and not too salty. Being the carnivore that I am, I was shocked that I really enjoyed the broccoli too. It was as perfect as steamed vegetables could get. It was bright green from top to bottom and crispy, not mushy.   My sister had pasta with shrimp. I must say, though there was shrimp on her plate, they were not \"shrimp\" at all! They were huge!! Seriously, Delmonico must get their produce, seafood and meat from \"Food Heaven R Us\" or something.   Although the food was good, I would say the service is what gives Delmonico 4-stars. Again, I'm not a frequent fine diner. So, to have my water glass filled up every time it gets low to having another (delicious) roll magically appear on my plate just as I suck in the last mouthful is fantastic! I'd even go so far as to say they'd probably spray the air around me with something fragrant once the broccoli hit you know where.   Now I can see why it's worth it to pay at least $50 for dinner. Thanks Emeril!",

    "text": "Overall, I thought Delmonico was unimpressive given its rep and price point. I would suggest SW Steakhouse or Gordon Ramsay instead.   Here's the salient-  Service The Staff was friendly enough but nothing special. There was a LOUD diner (really loud as I'm from NYC and used to noisy restaurants) and, despite my request, my server did not ask the guy to take it down a notch.   Food - The popovers, to start, were good but I was disappointed that no other bread was offered, which is usually the case with steakhouses. - The word that comes to mind when describing the quality of the filet is mediocre. It looked like it had been pulverized with a meat mallet. Pretty bland and not juicy at all. - My friend did enjoy his pork chop and it looked much better than my steak.  - The twice baked potato was a big disappointment given that the bottom of it felt rock hard and the whipped potato on top was bland. - The fried apple pies were adequate. My friend really liked the pecan pie.",

    "text": "4.5 out of 5 Stars.  Being an Emeril Lagasse restaurant, you had to expect the best.    One of my previous reviews of an expensive steakhouse stated that I could not imagine paying outrageous prices for a steak considering there are only so many ways that you can prepare it.  With that being said I still believe that is True, however I did not pay for my dinner this night since it was for Business :).    Delmonico's is located in The Venetian Resort and Casino right across from the Mirage.  I have always thought the Venetian was one of the more classy places to go in Vegas and Delmonico's was no different.  We called ahead to put our names in for an 8:00pm reso but we got there early at 7.  Some of us were dressed in shorts and flip flops, but since it was Vegas I think thats why we got away with it.  After checking in they said they could seat us early and to take a seat at the bar to relax.  After ordering a few drinks, we were seated promptly by a very friendly hostess.  (On a side note, they have an extensive Scotch list which includes some very rare 100 yr old Scotch's for $150-200 a pop).  We sat down towards the kitchen and was greeted by a stunning blonde waitress...I believe her name was Dale, but I could be mistaken.    We took a look at the menu and this place is not cheap.  You are looking at around 50 bucks for a steak.  Most of us ordered the Ribeye which is my favorite cut of meat and you can either get it bone-in or not bone-in...22oz or 16oz respectively. We started off with BBQ shrimp which is what they are known for and Ahi Tuna and Salmon Tartare.  Both of these were fantastic.  Our steaks came out quickly and they were cooked perfectly.  The sides here are a la carte and each could easily feed at least 4 people.  We got the garlic mashed potatoes and it too was quite delicious.  All in all this place was amazing....They have a team of people, 3 to a table, to make sure your water is always filled, bread is on your plate, and that you have everything you would need.    I was mesmerized by our waitress and was inspired to tell her that she was stunningly beautiful.  She was an excellent waitress too haha.    If you are looking for a good restaurant in Vegas I would definitely give this one a try.  Be prepared to spend some money, but it was well worth it.",

No one took are drink order for over 15 minutes even though the restaurant was only half full on a Thursday night - many people who were seated after us were already having their second drink and getting their appetizers.  Eventually after trying to get the waiters attention as he repeatedly walked by I ended up just having to get up and walk across the restaurant to have some one take our order which led to a waiter taking our drink and food order in a couple minutes....  But even then the service was lackluster and not a bit apologetic about the wait.  If you are spending $300 for dinner for two you expect decent service.  This place was a big fail.",

The moment we walked into the restaurant, the host greeted us by saying \"Happy Birthday\" to my hubby, which started the night great for us.  For once, I didn't get a side eye or a raised eyebrow when I asked my steak to be well-done; there was no snobby attitude from our server, and all the food we ordered was cooked to perfection.  Hubby ordered the bone-in ribeye (medium), I ordered regular ribeye, and we shared twice baked potato.  Their portions were so generous that we had no room for dessert.  Specialty cocktails didn't live up to my expectation and was a bit of a let down, but deceptively strong so worth the money.  Over all, really great first time experience here.  Oh, and a shoutout to our server Dale, who was nice, witty, and took care of us.",

    "text": "I decided to take my wife to Las Vegas for our first anniversary.  She'd never been to Las Vegas, but had always wanted to go.  She asked me if we could get dressed up and go somewhere nice one of the nights we were there.  So after doing a little bit of research I stumbled upon Delmonico.  With a name like Emeril Lagasse associated with the place it had to be good right? I went to the website and looked over their menu.  The prices can be very intimidating to someone not used to a fine dining experience.  I really appreciated that the prices were on the menu on the website, because I would not have planned ahead otherwise, and might have choked when I saw them.  However, we only have one first anniversary so I decided we should go for it.    I called and made a reservation about 5 days in advance, the person on the phone was extremely courteous and helpful.  She asked me if we were celebrating a special occasion.  After I explained it was our first anniversary, she said that she would note it on the reservation.    We arrived at Delmonico at about 7:55pm, we had reservations for 8pm.  We were greeted at the front desk by a young woman.  She immediately said \"Happy Anniversary\" and asked us to have a seat in the lounge.  At about 8:05pm our name was called and we were led back to our table.  A table for four quickly became a table for two.  All the extra silverware, plates, and glasses were whisked away.  The serving staff was beyond courteous, even offering us black napkins due to our clothes being black.    Drink orders were taken and suddenly a plate was placed in front of us. \"Courtesy of the chef, for your anniversary.\" said the server.  It was a crostini, with slightly cooked piece of beef, some blue cheese dressing, and chives topped with olive oil.  I hate blue cheese but I ate it anyway, and it was quite good.    The server asked my wife about wine, and my wife said she liked it but was not very familiar with the types of wine.  The server asked my wife a few questions and came back with a glass of wine my wife loved, and a sample of another kind of wine she might like to have in the future, my wife loved the sample as well.    When it came time to order, my wife order the heirloom tomato appetizer that they have.  It basically sliced heirloom tomatoes with cheese and red onions, drizzled with oil and balsamic.  She loved it.  She also got the Filet Mignon, and buttered asparagus.  Her steak was amazing, I tried a bite of it.  It was cooked perfectly.  It had a little spice to it from the seasoning, all around it was the best Filet Mignon I've ever experienced.  The asparagus was cooked perfectly.    I ordered the Delmonico signature cut, a bone in Ribeye.  Ribeye is my favorite cut of steak by far.  I've been eating primarily Ribeye for so long it's hard to believe that I was ever happy with other cuts.  I also ordered their take on creamed corn.  The Ribeye was worth the whole trip, it was the by far the best Ribeye I have ever encountered and probably ever will.  It was cooked perfectly.  It had the proper amount of fat that should be expected with a Ribeye.  It was amazing.  The corn was really good also.  Our server then brought us another complimentary dish from the kitchen, cherry sorbet.  Written in chocolate around the outside of the bowl was \"Happy Anniversary\".  It was pretty good, I'm not a big sorbet person, however please remember, it was free.    Even with the complimentary dessert my wife and I couldn't pass up a chance to try one of the menu dessert items.  We chose butterscotch Creme Brulee.  It came with 3 butterscotch/chocolate chip cookies on the side.  It was amazing, and probably our new standard for Creme Brulee.  All in all our experience was awesome.  The food was outstanding and the service was great.  My glass never got empty.  Every time I finished a dinner roll another roll was promptly placed on the plate in it's place.  After the 2nd or 3rd roll, I looked over towards my wife, grinning.  The server saw this and quietly said with a smile on her face, \"You know that is going to keep happening.\" I told my wife that when I was over the rolls, I probably needed to leave a bite on the plate to avoid a new roll. It was funny.    I would recommend Delmonico to anyone who is in Vegas and looking for a great place to go.  I would encourage anyone who does go to go with the expectation or a fantastic meal.  I think if you go in with the idea of being critical, you will probably find something to complain about, as the couple at the next table did.  They had multiple issues, and sent a few things back to the kitchen.  Remember that food preparation is an art not a science, and enjoy.",

    "text": "Our bad experience started with the lady who answered when I called to set a resv. She sounded like she wasn't very happy and didn't make me feel good about planning to go to Delmonicos.   We get there and the hostess simply said \"follow me\" she did not make eye contact or even ask \"how's your evening?\" She walked so fast to our table it was hard to keep up.  She sat us, gave us a napkin, said nothing at all, and walked away.  (Also they only have white napkins.. I'm used to fine dining where your napkin, either white or black, be offered to go with your ensemble.) Next, our server(s), didn't seem to care that we were dining there.  Not sure if they judged based on skin color, age, and style of clothes, but it felt like they did.  After offering us drinks and giving us menus, it was about an 8 to 10 minute wait to see our server again.. Mind you that we'd chosen what we'd have for dinner and had our menus closed a majority of that time. Overall for service from beginning til end was way below par for such a place.  We did not feel welcomed nor that they gave 2 funks about us. FOOD: My bone in rib eye was ordered medium and came out medium well, which made it particularly dry and tough.  My spouses bone in rib eye was cooked correctly (medium), but was nothing to call home about. I ordered my steak Oscar style.  The asparagus was the highlight of our dinner and the crab seemed a but overlooked and dry. We also had a lobster tail each, which came de-shelled and on top of the rib eye.  Drawn butter was brought out but lemon was not, nor offered. We had the New Orleans style creamed spinach.. The only \"new Orleans\" about it was the name.  The spinach tasted fresh but it was about a 3.5/5 on overall taste and quality. For the price there are many better options in Las Vegas (Mastro's ocean club; the capital grille, del frisco's..).   We will surely never return.",

    "text": "Very busy and noisy restaurant. Asparagas was cooked perfectly, however quite flavorless. The mashed potatoes were tasty.   For the price, the spinach should have been fresh and the cream sauce needs improvement.  My organic filet was good and nicely cooked to medium rare, however not near as tasty as other organic beef I have had for half the price. The New Orleans gumbo was a tad too salty.  The yorkshire style buns were average and were cold.   The key lime pie was average.  The tartness was lacking.  The apple pie was a disappointment, with a doughy flavoured crust. Another thing that  high end restaurants need to learn is how to choose great coffees like good wines.  I asked where the beans were from and they had no idea.  I would expect excellence in all areas of my food consumption and yes, even with my coffee. The espresso was extremely poor. This is a restaurant that is way overpriced for average to good tasting food.  Nothing was outstanding or excellent. So I can only give it a rating of 2 combining value and flavour.",

With so many places to choose from we decided on Delmonico because it was in our hotel & we figured we couldn't go wrong at one of Emeril's restaurants. The dining area was very spacious & well decorated. The staff was very friendly and attentive to all our needs. I started with the wedge salad which was excellent. The bacon had a great smokey flavor & was crispy. The blue cheese was some of the best I ever had. My wife had the lobster bisque which was excellent as well. We the decided to try the Chateaubriand dinner for 2 which came with garlic mashed potatoes & asparagus. The meal is brought out and the meat is served table side. We ordered it medium rare & it was perfect for me. It had excellent flavor and was extremely tender. My wife would have preferred it to be a little more cooked in the center but she ate the outer pieces which for a little more well down but still tender & tasty. The potatoes & asparagus were both  perfectly cooked with great flavor. We passed on dessert because we were too full to eat anything else. I would highly recommend this restaurant & would eat there again when in Vegas!",

We started with an heirloom tomato salad which was quite good.  Truffle and parm chips were delicious as well and certainly something I've looked to duplicate at home.  Buffalo ribeye was a good change of pace as well from the typical Texas steak house offerings.  Really enjoyed the wine reduction with that.  Also sampled the filet which was pretty standard, well done however.  Wine selection was also fairly reasonable with options for everyone.",

The service here is spectacular, and the food is equally enjoyable. My girls and I shared our entrees and side dishes, so that we could each have a taste of a little bit of everything.  Entrees: - FILET MIGNON - 9 oz, and absolutely melt-in-your-mouth yummy. This cut was like BUTTER. - EMERIL'S BBQ SALMON - Also melted like butter with every bite. It was amazing how tender, yet well-cooked the fish was. The hash side dish that came with the meal was very complimentary! - GRILLED MARINATED ORGANIC CHICKEN BREAST - Mostly juicy (a teeny bit dry), but great flavors. The fingerling potatoes were pretty standard, and the wild mushrooms weren't very tasty to me. - BONE IN RIBEYE - 20 oz, and great for sharing! Our waiter even cut the steak for our girls so that each could have medium rare/well. - AMERICAN RED SNAPPER - the sides didn't seem as appealing at first for my friend who had this dish, but she ended up enjoying them!  Sides: - CREAMED CORN GRATINEE - delicious. A great combination of that sweet and salty flavor. Texture was right on point! - BUTTERED FRESH ASPARAGUS - fabulous crunch, and not so much flavor added to cover up the natural enjoyable flavor of the veggie  All in all, a great experience. We weren't too full at the end of the meal, and didn't have to worry about wasting any food or taking back any leftovers.  Highly recommended!",

    "text": "We had lunch at Delmonico Steakhouse in the Venetian on Saturday. When we arrived around 1:15 PM there were only two other tables occupied by diners, so we got plenty of attention from Adriana, who was very professional and helped to create a wonderful lunch experience for us.  As starters we ordered the Buttered Fresh Asparagus and Sauteed Wild Garlic Mushrooms The asparagus was delicious and the mushrooms were simply incredible. If you are a garlic lover you must try these mushrooms; we are and we believe we would make a return trip to the Delmonico just to order these again.  We then split a Grilled Skirt Steak Sandwich which featured wonderfully marinated, expertly cooked steak with a horseradish mayo that perfectly complemented the meat. The sandwich was outstanding, and there was no extra charge for splitting it and serving us each half on own own plate.   We then decided to go for it and split a piece of Emeril's famous Banana Cream Pie. This turned out to be not your ordinary banana cream pie in that there seemed to be no cream filling with the bananas. It looked like a vast number of differently shaped banana slices had been stacked on the crust in a kind of patchwork design, and yet they had done something to these bananas to make them deliciously sweet. There was a substantial amount of whipped cream on top of the slice which had been dusted with chocolate and drizzled with caramel. This pie was definitely a winner, and we regretted that we had no more room to sample some of their other desserts.   We are already planning a return visit to Delmonico Steakhouse next time we are in Vegas to further explore their menu and other items. Based on our lunch experience there we know we will be in for some fabulous flavors.",

We also had at least two others who served us.  All were very professional and patient. Our party was not the eaisiest to serve that night, but what happens in Vegas...!  Obviously food tastes are very subjective.  My bone in ribeye and twice baked potato were great.  I did not care too much for the chicken and waffle dish my wife had... neither did she.  The shrimp appetizer was a 10, as was the crab dish.   The desserts... Creme Brulee, banana creme pie and chocolate cake were very good also.  Overall, a very nice experience.  We will return.",

    "text": "Let's be honest: steakhouses are a dime-a-dozen in Las Vegas. Every which way you look, there's some place that's being advertised as \"The Best Steakhouse in Nevada!\" or \"THE Las Vegas Steakhouse\" or \"If Elvis Were Alive, He Would Eat Here!\"  Not all steakhouses are created equal -- Delmonico is proof of that.  Situated in between the Palazzo and the Venetian, Delmonico is unassuming from the outside. It looks simple and classy. Once you step inside, however, you realize that comfort is their highest priority. The chairs are deep and made of the most comfortable leather. You won't want to get up when you're finished with your meal.   This was our second visit (our first for lunch), and I must say that the service was just as attentive and cordial as they had been the first time. Both of our servers were named Peter (which turned out to be quite humorous when we called out for one and they both came running), and they were extremely pleasant. They had absolutely no problem recommending dishes or letting us know their personal favorites.   For my appetizer, I had the heirloom tomato salad. The tomatoes were ripe, juicy, and delicious. The accompanying cheese was a perfect pair to offset the acidity of the tomatoes. Thin slivers of onions covered the perimeter of the plate, which were also very nice.  I chose the fillet of beef medallions for my entree, and I was impressed with how absolutely wonderful they were. About a half-dollar in diameter and an inch tall, they were perfectly cooked, not to mention topped in Parmesan cheese and drizzled with homemade Worcestershire sauce.   Delmonico doesn't need to be one of those places that wears people out with advertising. They know how good they are, and they aren't afraid to knock your socks off. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a relaxing way to enjoy an evening with good people and great food.",

Seriously, could you ask for anything more. I had tears welling up in my eyes it was so good. I was having a moment. Tender beyond belief. The cajun rub did not taste cajun. It tasted like seasoned perfection.  Excellent sides and appetizers. Wine list, extensive. Decor wasn't my style but very simple - nothing to write home about. The staff was very attentive, helpful, and courteous.   Again. Mind blowing!",

    "text": "Came here for lunch during restaurant week with a few other Yelpers. It's located in the Venetian, but it's easier if you self park at Palazzo to find it. If you self park, you have to walk through the entire hotel to get to restaurant row, which is where Delmonico's is located. I was the first to arrive so I sat in the bar area, which was very cozy. Before long, we were seated at our table. The restaurant had a few others dining in there but it wasn't busy at all. There were 3 waiters servicing our table. One for water, one to clear and one to serve. Maybe not specifically, but it seemed that way.  The chef sent over a complimentary appetizer for the table; lemon ricotta served over thinly sliced red apple and bruschetta with tapenade and pesto. (I think a green apple would have been much better. I dont care for the texture nor the taste of red apples) The appetizer was very nice. The soup followed and I didnt care for that one bit. It tasted like warm ketchup. Ew. Ew, ew, ew. So not a fan. Thankfully, that was the only dish I didn't care for. The grilled cheese that accompanied the soup was very good. I enjoyed that quite a bit. The tomato salad and the house green salad that others ordered looked absolutely delicious. Every one finished everything, so I guess they liked it too. The salmon entree was delicious. I asked for it cooked well done and it came back, cooked fantastically! It wasn't medium at all and it was so juicy. Even Christina who likes hers cooked much less, said it was very good. I tried her butternut squash ravioli. It was OK. The flavor in the ravioli was good, but it 1. should have been warmer and 2. the pasta was too soft. It should have been al dente.  The dessert was good as well. Your choice between banana cream pie or pecan pie. I opted for the pecan. It was served with vanilla ice cream and whipped cream. It was good too. I tried Christina's banana cream pie, and it tasted good, although I didn't care for the look of it, with all those squares of banana.  The service was very good, they didn't add the 18% automatically (I prefer when places do that, honestly). The food was good, not great, but good. The price, $30.13 for 3 courses was OK. It was \"pricey\" for lunch, however, the quality of the food and the portions were generous. I dont really see myself going back there. There are a lot of other places I'd like to try and places that I love already that I will return to. It was a great time with great people!",

    "text": "This is solely for the Chef's Table experience.  The bar area, dining room, and professional wait service is on par with spendy steakhouses. The vibe is casual, yet classy and not stuffy or pretentious, but imma talk more about this other thing going on near the kitchen.   If you want to catch a glimpse of the restaurant's inner sanctum, with a backstage-VIP-behind-the-scene view of organized chaos that is a proper kitchen service (and willing to pay for the private room setting), then prepare for a premium dinner. Anyone with an unbent iPhone 6+ can snap selfies and food pics these days, but you need just a little more than reservations for this opportunity.   Our group was ushered through the dining room and towards the kitchen door, then guided into a side room that was separated from the dining room area. Glass panels allowed us to see the various kitchen workstations. In this fishbowl room, it was cramped quarters, like dudes crammed into a submarine mess hall, but you kinda just get used to it and settle in for the experience. Battle stations!  The food (photos uploaded) was brought in by a team of waiters and chefs and placed in front of us in unison at every course. Each tasting was beautifully plated and delicious. Course after course was brought in, and they even paused mid-service to allow diners to return from their nicotine break before bringing in the next round of plates.  After all these dinner courses, there isn't much room left in the tummy for dessert. I was expecting maybe something light and sweet to cleanse the palate. Suddenly, these giant platters of everything from the dessert menu appeared! It wasn't just one or two items. So much decadence and it was a surprisingly wonderful grand finale to a spectacular meal.  For the amount $$$$pent, we could've went for bottle service, made it rain, or get swindled at a rub-n-tug joint, but we indulged on a magical evening of delightful food pr0n. Would go again if I hit a Vegas jackpot.",

The filet mignon done au poive was superb (5/5). Not necessarily the most traditional prep but the cajun seasoning combined with the crusted pepper and very tender beef made for an awesome bite.  The bone in rib eye (5/5) was also cooked expertly and one of the most flavorful and not too fatty pieces of steak I've had.  The shrimp cocktail (3.5/5) was nice but I thought standard cocktail sauce would have been better. The slice of avocado and sprig of microgreens made it nice.  Service was on point and very professional.   Would come back here again. Thought it was better than Cut Steakhouse in the Venetian.",

We were offered menus and an iPad for our wine selections. I ordered a champagne to celebrate my last race of the year, and the fiancee ordered a glass of Justin cab (one of his faves).  -We were offered comped bread (popover) and butter. LOVE THE SOFT BUTTER!!!  -Lobster bisque to share ($16) -Bone-in ribeye ($55) -Bone-in NY Strip ($50) -Twice Baked Potato ($9) -Duck Egg Creme Brulee ($11)  Steaks had a great rub on it and was topped with butter. YUP butter... Because I had the rib-eye, there was a lot of fat! YUM!!! I was only able to eat half my steak since it was so huge!!! The fiancee finished his NY. The potato was average and came with all the fixings on the side. I just wanted extra butter. Dinner was great.  The dessert was a bit disappointing. We ordered the duck egg creme brulee since it was unique and highly recommended. At first the dessert was good, but after eating a couple more bites, the dessert started tasting a bit funny. It was so rich and I think the weird taste was getting to our tastebuds! Too bad there wasn't a molten lava cake!  Service and ambiance was superb. Love walking through the Palazzo to get this restaurant! Beautiful!!!",

    "text": "I travel for work quite a bit.  In those travels I go to a large number of steakhouses, many are wonderful, some are unimpressive, a few, well a few are just unbelievable.  Service is never the biggest scale tipper for me, but I understand it is very important for some people.  The service at Delmonico is impeccable.  Dishes are cleared away quickly, menu items are explained in necessary detail, drinks are always full, and complaints are addressed quickly and quietly.  Decor generally means little to my review.  I appreciate aesthetics as much as the next 30-something, but a bare room with nothing on the walls isn't going to change my number of stars, and to be honest, I couldn't even tell you what Delmonico looks like on the inside, I don't care, the only thing that matters is those steaks.  I prefer my steak in the form of a ribeye.  Bone-in or boneless, I don't really care.  I order it rare+ with a hard sear (some may call it Pittsbugh, sometimes I do).  At Delmonico I got myself the boneless ribeye, rare+ with a hard sear, and they brought it to me rare+ with a hard sear.  This was one of the best pieces of meat I've ever eaten in my life.  It reminded me of the first time I ate at a real steakhouse when I was in my early 20s, it caused this awakening inside of me, of what I may have been missing in the world.  There was a crunch as you cut into it, and then a soft slide through buttery, perfectly cooked meat, with a hint of salt once you put it in your mouth.  I'll eat at Delmonico every time I go back to Las Vegas.  There were sides too.  I don't remember what they were.  I don't care.",

The char on it was perfect, the inside a perfect medium. If I had one complaint - it'd be that I didn't order two of them.  The side dishes and dessert were also delicious, and the service was amazing as well. Of course, the price was expensive, but I would hope no one going to this restaurant would be surprised by the price. You get what you pay for.  I'm keeping the review short - if you don't mind paying good money for a great meal, then go here. You will not regret it.",

I assumed that the prices might sway the opinions of many.  Man, was I wrong. We walked in to this modern but simply decorated establishment on time and our party of 11 were immediately seated. Michael was our head server and he made sure we received water, a wine list and our menus.  I had noticed that a summer trio for $65 was available so that is the angle I decided to take. I felt a little guilty that our employer was eating this tab so I wanted to be fair. I ordered the Mini Wedge, the Petite Rib-Eye and a Caramel Butter Cake a la mode. Most went this route although some selected the STRIP. You think Vegas had something to do with that?  My salad was good but I thought the Bleu Cheese on the plate was a bit understated. I do like Bleu Cheese with some POP. My Rib-Eye was called petite but it was still a plentiful portion. It was prepared PERFECTLY and the Chimichurri applied on top had the old taste buds doing somersaults.    The dessert which is offered by itself was upgraded with a scoop of ice cream with Michael's recommendation. His idea was spot on. All in all, everyone enjoyed their FABULOUS meals. We laughed, conversed and immersed ourselves in each other. We definitely had a relaxing dinner.   The evening would not have been as grand without the service we received. Michael and his staff performed impeccably. The service was orchestrated and attentive. Make sure to stroll in one evening and ask if Michael can take care of you. You will not regret it.",

I come to the Venetian very often as an invited guest and have never had such a sub-par dining experience. With so many other great options don't bother with this one....",

    "text": "Hard to write this review because I will say my rib eye steak was done to perfection. Well-seasoned, cooked perfectly. Tender and flavorful meat. That's where the compliments stop. We also ordered a side of broccoli to share and some au gratin potatoes. The broccoli at $9 was just horrifying. It's all the reasons that children don't want to eat their vegetables. I think it started with an awful product. The broccoli itself was not only lacking in freshness, it was limp and flavorless. It could not have been good broccoli to begin with. It seemed as if it was frozen and then heated up slightly as it was mushy. It was also underwhelming with seasoning of any sort. Surprising from a restaurant of this caliber. Why bother selling broccoli when it was so disgusting. The au gratin potatoes were good. These at least had salt and were not overly cheesy. I give them a B.  As for service, it was OK. I realize hard to do good service with large parties. I will tell you that even though the server made up for it in the end, there was a big problem. I ordered a side of foie gras. It appeared on the table in front of me and then at some point in the service, someone from the wait staff came over and took it away from me so quickly, I didn't even have a chance to ask about it. Perplexed, I asked our server. He apologized and tried to get a new order on my table asap and he took it off the bill.  Unfortunately, I cannot recommend the foie that came to me. It was cold in the middle and uninteresting. Let me tell you that cold foie is not good. Disappointing on all fronts.",

We started off with the truffle Parmesan chips which were phenomenal, the dates (I could have done without, but they were good), and a tomato salad. Honestly, could have done without every thing except the amazing fries. Ah yes...I forgot to mention that they start the meal by bringing you an insanely delicious popover.   We all got steak and everyone was happy with their choice and preparation. I am never happy with the temperature on my filet and the medium rare was exactly how I like it. We got the Brussels sprouts as a side (served family style) and again, they were just how I like them. They were very charred, which I prefer, but if you don't like a bit of a burn on your Brussels, I'd go for one of the potato options.   Overall, this was one of the best meals I've had in a long time. Our server was insanely friendly and personable, yet, didn't need to know all our of personal information. This was the perfect Sunday night out!!!",

    "text": "Decided to celebrate V Day here as we haven't been but we remembered that we enjoyed Emeril's at MGM years ago. Creole food is packed with flavor and that's exactly what we were looking for.   The restaurant is gorgeous. Minimalism at its finest. All white with natural touches and I appreciated the layout not seating you on top of each other like so many restaurants make the mistake of doing nowadays. Felt like you were underground in a cave-like setting in some foreign country far away from the city...  We were warmly greeted by fresh popovers still hot from the oven and luxurious creamy butter. Great intro to what else was in store for the evening.   Couldn't pass up the table-side caesar for two and I loved that they rubbed a lemon wedge around the entire plate which enhanced the flavors. Stealing this idea for anytime I make a caesar at home.   My bbq salmon was delicious with very light fried onion rings and mushrooms instead of the sausage hash (just wasn't in the mood for meat) and they had no problem with my request. Very appreciative. My man ordered a filet with a crazy amount of foie gras to top it off and loved every bite.  Sides are meant for sharing so we tried the creamed corn packed with spices and the ultra cheesy potato gratin. I recommend you try both.   Drinks were STRONG! There wasn't any room left for sweets so we'll just have to come back.",

    "text": "If you're on the fence as to which steakhouse you should choose for a special dinner while in Las Vegas, look no further.    We've been were twice.  Once before Yelp was born, and again on the 4th a few days ago.  I know of what I speak. Delmonico's is the bomb.   Take the time to have a drink at the bar before dinner.  Try a Turbodog Brown Ale made in Louisiana.  They also make the best Lemon Drop Martini I've ever had.    It smells great in there like a good steakhouse should.  The dinning room is comfortable yet still classy.  The host and hostess that night were both very nice.  The wait staff work together in harmony.  Very professional, yet still making you feel your a guest and not just another customer.    My GF (The Queen of Reseda) and my usual MO is to split a salad, sides, and a big cut of beef.    The rolls they bring are like little pillowy clouds.  They kept bringing them so I kept eating them.  Petite Iceberg Lettuce Wedges Wisconsin Buttermilk Blue Cheese Dressing, Homemade Apple Smoked Bacon and Red Onion.  Loved the Buttermilk Blue Cheese Dressing.  Great!    Bone In Ribeye, Medium Rare U.S.D.A. Prime, Dry-aged. Our waiter split it for us table side. I resisted the temptation to order A1 in a place like this and ordered some of Emeril's Worcestershire Sauce.  Good call Neanderthal man. Exceptional!  Roasted Maine Lobster Tail Grilled Lemon and Clarified Butter. About 12 oz. to 14 oz.  Expensive but good!  Buttered Fresh Asparagus Hey, this is kinda healthy and green.  Better order some Bearnaise sauce.  There's not too much butter in that right?  Creamed Corn Gratinee Get it, it's awesome.  Emeril's Banana Cream Pie Caramel Sauce, Chocolate Shavings and Whipped Cream. I asked if we could just get a half slice knowing I wasn't going to get much help from the Queen of Reseda.  I was politely told no can do.  Bring it anyway!  It's all you fat boy!  A cup of freshly brewed coffee and that Banana Cream Pie was a very nice way to end what can only be described as a wonderful dinner from start to finish.",

We start the meal with the truffled chips which are a must order and the french onion soup. I order the NY strip medium which is my favorite cut and my husband the house special ribeye medium rare. The meal progression is long. Although we knew we would have several waiters and main waiter whom gave me the card never made his way back to out table to check on us. We had to flag down the other waiters, even to pay our bill. Finally steaks arrive. Mine was cooked medium rare. Although not my desired temperature it did have flavor and seasoning. My husband's ribeye had an encrusted char on the outside cooked medium well on the inside and lacked any kind of seasoning. Did not taste like a steak that was aged for whatever amount of days. I would even go as far as to say the steak tasted burnt on the outside. Sides ordered with steaks were all OK, nothing memorable. I was completely disappointed with the service and quality of food.",

    "text": "We had a memorable dinner celebrating our anniversary at Delmonico Steakhouse having our usual classic choices plus some signature Emeril dishes. The service was everything that you would expect from an Emeril restaurant plus more with Chef Rainwater and staff rolling out the red carpet making the night special for my wife and I.  Greeted with congratulations on our anniversary at the host stand, we were seated immediately for our Thursday night 8 PM reservation along the wall in the classy main dining room. A nice touch that we noticed toward the end of the meal was that although the restaurant was almost at capacity, no diners were sat at any adjacent table leaving us secluded for the entire meal. We had a few bonus tastings added to our meal including two complimentary celebratory desserts. And at the end of the meal, the friendly manager who was overseeing our entire meal, escorted us to the kitchen where we had a brief word with Chef Rainwater and photo op.  If you're looking for a cocktail, check out their creative list which some of the drinks looked very interesting, but I just stayed with my Irish whiskey. The wine list is also extensive enough that they carried a couple of choices for my picky wife. Emeril mainstays such as the barbecue shrimp and banana cream pie are items that you should try at least once. The poached main lobster was a special for the night that did not disappoint. The highlight for my meal was the bone in ribeye with Creole seasoning topped with maitre d' butter. I savored every bite of the dry aged beef and I don't think there's much doubt that I could have eaten another one.  The tab was just over two bills which I had no problem with the splurge and felt it was well worth it with the gracious hospitality we received. You'll find your classic steakhouse dishes at Delmonico but you'll also see some twists with Creole influence. You'll also be assured that the service will uphold the Emeril standard.",

    "text": "The thing about fine dining establishments is that there's a heck of a chance you'll leave without having had your fill, so you're encouraged to empty your wallet even more for all the trimmings.  Don't make that mistake at Delmonico Steakhouse, even if everything looks and is delicious.  Almost everything at Emeril's restaurant here is sharable.  I was here for a couple friends' birthdays, and everybody at my table ordered one appetizer to go with the steaks we ordered.  As good as everything was, we just ended up staring at our food 20 minutes after being served.  As for the food, as I stated, it's all terrific.  The complimentary bread is some of the best I've ever had.  They're delicate to the touch, and when you bite into it, the texture is flakier than a croissant.  I didn't even know that was possible with a roll.    I had the lobster bisque as an appetizer, which was creamy and some decent chunks of lobster in it.  For the record, I actually finished it.  Another person at our table ordered the seafood tower which is something you should get on a big baller budget, but everything from the oysters, to the lobster, and crab claws were scrumptious.  The country smashed potatoes, sauteed garlic mushrooms, truffle parmesan potato chips, and duck fat fingerling potatoes?  All amazing.  Now, the steak.  Most of them are dry-aged, so we're talking $$$ here, but like my fellow Yelper Ferdinand L. said, do not attempt to have a steak without the foie gras on top.  If you've never had foie gras before, this is the time to do it.  The result is something you'll simply salivate over.  Now it wasn't the best steak I ever had, but it was one of those situations where after eating here, I know most things after will be a disappointment, so choose your next meal wisely.  My whole table had the meat stares, and only one person at the table finished their entree.  Just a great dining experience.",

It was shareable between the four of us and held us over until our steaks! They gave us complimentary bread that was so warm and slightly crispy....it was heavenly!   I ordered the NYS, medium well and it came out perfectly cooked with garlic butter on top. The steak was huge and I was able to eat 3/4!! Honestly, all top steak places in Vegas taste the same to me due to the high quality meats they use but what I look for in these restaurants are the quality and taste in the sides and appetizers!   The sauteed mushrooms were seasoned perfectly and very tasty. The smashed potatoes were creamy and complimented the steaks very well!  The service was excellent; I highly recommend this place!",

The services is awesome, my friend dropped a spoon and before she could pick it up, she was handed a new one already. Then when dishes arrived, everyone got their plates at the exact same time. They had like 5 servers placing a dish in front of each person. We also got free crabcakes which was really nice of them. Now the food. Man yes it's expensive but SO WORTH IT! I mean you get a lot of food and the food is so freaking good. I have never tasted a ribeye steak greater than this one. It like melted in your mouth, even though meat isn't suppose to do that, I meant that it was so tender OH MY GOSH! I'm so going back next time I'm in Vegas. Their drinks are really good too. Man no complaints at all about this place!",

I loved the mozzarella bruschetta we had, it had amazingly good flavor (garlic, shallots, tomatoes) drizzled lightly with either a balsamic reduction or really well aged balsamic vinegar, and on a toast point that wasn't hard and crusty.  Their soup special was pumpkin soup, creamy and seasoned nicely.  My husband I both got salads, I got the spinach salad with bacon and he got the fresh baby greens.  Both were good.  Too bad we came to a steakhouse and only ordered vegetarian dishes, we were just overwhelmed by all the heavy food we've been eating since we arrived in Vegas.  Next time, we'll try their seafood or meat dishes.  We finished off our meal with dessert, the fruit cobbler topped with caramel ice cream was YUM!",

We went in a large (all male) group so I wont describe each dish, but simply give a brief overview. The service and decor are both wonderful. You were given a relatively large amount of space, at least for a steakhouse. The appetizers, steaks, sides, and desserts are great! A must go to for those looking for an upscale, but great steak dinner. In terms of price, it is average for a Vegas steakhouse.",

Will probably head back after experiencing some more of what Vegas has to offer.  So much to see... so little time!  I would give it 4.5 stars if I could, but I am going to have to agree about the ambiance - a bit on the bright side (sights n'sound).  In the end, Delmonico's seemed to be a consistent and classic dining experience.",

    "text": "We went for lunch.  And we were super early, the first ones there.  So maybe that contributed to the lack of enthusiasm that we started out with.  Our waiter was very nice but he didn't quite seem all there at first.  He asked me if I wanted a side of potatoes after I order a burger that comes with fries.  He walked away before we could order drinks and we had to call him back.  But after the initial turbulence, everyone settled in and we had a good meal.  I started with the gumbo which was perfectly fine, but it lacked a little soul for me.  For my entree I ordered the burger, as mentioned.  I just wasn't in the mood for steak for lunch or any of the other entrees for that matter.    The burger was freakin' awesome.  It didn't have any weird toppings, just the standard lettuce, tomato, mayo maybe, whatever.  But this thing was a MONSTER.  That burger must have been about 3/4 of a pound.  It stood about 8 inches high and was delivered with a steak knife plunged into it to keep it all put together.  There was no way I was eating this thing with my hands.  This was a knife-and-forker all the way.  It was so much fun digging into that sexy hot beefy mama.  The fries were awesome too.  It's not often that I find a burger that I fall in love with but this is one that I will cherish forever.  5 star burger all the way.  Who needs a steak when you've got one of these babies.",

The atmosphere was cool & hip but not fake or stuffy as sometimes happens in upscale establishments. It was romantic & relaxed. We felt right at home. The service was top notch....friendly & efficient as one would hope. Our servers were always a nod away & ready to tend to all of our needs. The meal was simply fantastic. Our salads were crisp & fresh. We ordered the Chateaubriand for two & were blown away at the quality of beef & flavor. A nice touch was the final searing & butterfly filleting table side. Coffee was good. Dessert was shared as no room was left after the meal. We enjoyed every savory bite. The whole dinning experience has been one of our favorites to date.",

Most places in Vegas don't do corkage and he was super attached to the wine that he brought.      The service was incredible. They were so attentive and well versed when it came to the menu. Out of the 6 people we had with us 5 were or are in the food industry. The man was an executive chef and the rest are fine dinning servers. Our servers kept them very happy.     The man and I shared the Cesar salad for two prepared table side. I had the Fillet Oscar style. It was honestly the best steak I had ever had. They were very generous with the crab and asparagus. The rest of our party dinned on rib eye, pork chop and the day's specials. It was all amazing. We finished off the meal with a banana creme pie. I don't really like banana cream. This was outstanding. Real sliced bananas with fresh creme, my god!     When the bill came were pleasantly surprised at how reasonable it was. A little over $500 for 6 people and 3 bottles of wine.

The wait team is on the ball with every facet of service  -Food was fantastic of course.  Got the bone-in filet (10oz) which was cooked perfectly, the missus got the filet medallions, which was a bit misleading as these were small steaks, not \"medallions\"!! Lot of food.  The side dishes are quite large, suitable for 3 or 4, so a party of 2 will have more than enough ordering just 1 side dish.    -The room is very nice. Uber minimal, nothing on the walls, just nicely sculptured archways and ceilings.  Very nice environment for a phenomenal meal.   The prices are high, esp considering side dishes are all a la carte, but nothing astronomical.  Figure around $100/person for a starter, entree, non-alcoholic drink, dessert, tax and 20% tip.",

We both ordered the Bone In RIb Eye and it was one of the best steaks I have ever eaten that I was sucking the tasty bone with no shame.  One incredible meal and one of the best I have had in Vegas.  This is the place and I will be back for sure...",

    "text": "The steakhouse is like most traditional steakhouses. The decor was very clean and contemporary. The hostesses weren't all that attractive and would rate about a 5-6 in my scale of looks and their demeanor looked as if they did not really care to be there at all.   The dining area is half filled with patrons and business people alike chatting away about their day and how excellent the steak was prepared The beautiful burgundy high leather chairs is a nice touch and their seating area is plush and soft. The booth seating is a high suede sofa like seating and the tables were all lined with clean white linens and set in standard of most fine dining establishments.   I took my seat and I was greeted by the waiter and the captain and was asked about my choice of entree. I decided to go with their Filet Mignon and go with my good instincts that this would be the best choice. The chef prepared all the appetizers for a sampling. Classic jumbo shrimp cocktail, Parmesan truffle chips, classic Caesar salad, fried calamari, and mixed green salad.   The classic jumbo shrimp cocktail with a extremely spicy cocktail sauce wasn't as good as I expected. The shrimp were cooked well and the shrimp were presented beautifully, however, the spicy cocktail sauce did not please my taste buds or my nostrils for that matter. The sauce was like eating a handful of Wasabi.   The extremely addicting truffle Parmesan chips were EXCELLENT and should be ordered every time any patron enters this restaurant. The chips were drizzled with truffle oils and shaved Parmesan cheese and each individual chip melted as you put them in your mouth.   The classic Caesar salad had much to desire. The way the salad was prepared was not my idea of a good salad. It was literally a huge chunk of romaine lettuce with the heart in tact served with a plain and unappealing Caesar dressing. I don't like how fancy restaurants can slap a big chunk of romaine lettuce on a plate and call it a classic Caesar salad just to be different. Don't mess with a good thing!  The fried calamari was ok at best, not my favorite but definitely worth a taste. The mixed green salad was a way a salad should be prepared and had just the right amount of dressing. The waiter was attentive and knew what drinks were ordered. The plates were cleared but seemed like sometimes dead plates were left around. Not a good sign of service.   The entree finally came and the presentation could have been better but the Filet was ammmmazing. The steak knife cut through the Filet like a butter knife through room temperature butter. The steak was cooked to medium rare perfectly and encrusted with some New Orleans style spices. I truly enjoyed the Filet till the very last bite. One thing I do have to mention is the dessert. I would highly recommend the famous Emeril's banana cake. This thing was pure heaven and was absolutely delicious. I could not even describe it in words if I even tried so I won't! So you will have to try it for yourself.   Overall the experience was good, food was good but not the best I have tried, and the service was ok by my standards, but my standards can be high. My favorite parts were the Filet and the dessert, the appetizers once again could have been better with the exception of the truffle chips, mmm! delicious! I would recommend this place for dinner or lunch, however, the price can be a little daunting. I was calculating the totals of a appetizer, entree, and dessert and was estimating about 70-100 dollars a person with tip. That can look a little scary for some people, but for the meal and experience I'd say that was definitely worth it! Many thanks for reading. Till next time.",

Mmmmm Dry aged bone in rib eye....here just waiting to enter my watering mouth and be consumed by my emotional grinding of my mandibles. How can I forget - Truffle oil potato chips.  Popping my truffle oil cherry....Yum Ok I've never had fancy schmancy gumbo. But here it was very pleasant and chic. I mean come on - GUMBO - I WANT PIECES OF MEAT AND SEAFOOD AND OKRA..... Bone in RIB EYE - no more done than medium rare. Doesn't need any extra spices or sauces give me my meat plain. If I wanted it coated with jism. Well I can do it myself :) Steamed or grilled asparagus with hollandaise...Mmmmm I ate a lot...So I didn't have dessert like everyone else did. If I could I would have sucked on the bones. But that would have been a culinary faux paus. Bad Myke No sucking.....So How do they make the thick steak so dark and perfectly medium rare? Hmm...It's gotta be Keebler Elves performing magic. The service is impeccable. I went to the bathroom and put my napkin on my chair - just to find it folded neatly on my table.  Can we say Fancy Feast?",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I decided to eat one expensive meal in Vegas and chose Delmonico Steakhouse based on the Yelp reviews.  Yelpers know what they are talking about...the food was amazing!!!  We made reservations using OpenTable and when we arrived, they seated us towards the back of the restaurant and had already removed the extra 2 chairs at our table.  I was impressed!!  Most of the time, even if you make reservations, the restaurant still has to move the chairs and get the table ready.  Not Delmonico!  They were ready for us.  We ordered a bottle of white wine (even though I was having steak).  I don't remember what wine we had but it was good, even though it was a cheaper bottle.  For dinner, we started with the Caesar salad that they make tableside.  I'm not much of a Caesar salad fan but the boyfriend loves it.  The Caesar salad from Delmonico was amazing!  It tasted so fresh and crisp and the 'homemade' dressing was so good!  For entrees, the boyfriend ordered the pork chops and I ordered the filet mignon medallions.  We also shared a side of asparagus.  All of our food was excellent!    Just as an FYI, the pork chops were served with a side of mashed sweet potatoes (which I love!) but that wasn't mentioned on the menu.  The boyfriend kindly gave me the sweet potatoes in exchange for 1/2 of one of my filet medallions.  Speaking of the medallions, one of the top 5 steaks of my life!  I grew up in Oklahoma on a ranch where we had our own personal meat locker...so for me to say that Delmonico's filet medallions are one of the best I've ever tasted, that's definitely saying something!  Unfortunately, we were too full for dessert but thoroughly enjoyed our meal at Delmonico.  Just as a side note, the rolls before dinner are real dinner rolls with yeast!  I hate restaurants that serve dry, crusty rolls.",

    "text": "I went in with high expectations.   The service was what I had expected, they were very attentive and were on top of our needs throughout our meal.  Our waiters were great!  We sat down, water was brought over very quickly, as did the little \"wonton\" topped with kalamata olives and proscuitto thing.  I wasn't very impressed by it, I guzzled my water.  By the time I looked up again, my water had been refilled.  WOW!  The waiter brought our bread and explained the menu.  Then she let us be to ponder upon her words.  I chose the scallops with creamed corn sauce.  They scallops were cooked perfectly and the corn chower had lobster in it!  It was 7 minutes in HEAVEN!  The mister and I both opted for steak.  He has the filet mignon and I had the bone-in NY strip.  We decided to share a twice baked potato with cheese and bacon.  His filet was just a filet.  My NY was HUGE!  If I had known it was going to be so large, I would have gotten a filet too.  I was only able to eat half of mine and was not able to have any potato.  The mister finished his steak and all the potato plus his bread which I didn't touch.  The steaks were cooked med-rare perfectly and seasoned.  I could have done without any seasoning on it but hey, that's how they came.  It wasn't ovewhemling in spices but enough that I didn't need any sauces besides the delicious butter just melting so erotically on the plate.  I was stuffed full of steak but I needed to satiate my sweet tooth.  We shared a pecan pie which came with a mound of ice cream.  The crust was absolutely fantastic and the pecans were not burnt.  We had no wine because we were just too dehydrated from the heat, water was all we needed.  I think the mister was slightly disappointed that his filet mignon wasn't as tender as the kobe steaks he is used to.  OH WELL!  I enjoyed my steak and I enjoyed being tended to like a princess.  I had a great night, it would have been better if the darn tables weren't' so close together.  I would have given it 5 stars, I just didn't like being able to hear what the people next to me were whispering about.  The prices were fairly reasonable for Vegas, we've spent double at Yamashiro's and Redondo Beach pier, plenty of times.  Don't let the dress code fool you too much.  There were so many people in there wearing jeans and shorts, I felt a bit over dressed in a cocktail dress and he was wearing a dress shirt and slacks.  The restaurant looked semi-formal, the people there were looking mighty touristy so the ambiance was slightly off.",

As we waited a short time for our table to be prepared, we were invited to the lounge and bar - it was not impressive. The table selection, at first seemed unimpressive, but after a short while we began to appreciate our location. We were seated near the entrance to the dining room, but were hoping for a table deep into the interior. Asthe evening proceeded, we found that we could have a very fine conversation, while those dining well into the room had to raise the level of their conversation just to be heard over the din coming from  the remainder of the room.   The first component of the five star trating came with the extensive wine list. The wine list will amaze anyone. A selection for every taste .....   The service is also five star. Any need you have will be well attended at Delmonico's. I have a hard time believing that I went to one of the very best steakhouses in Las Vegas and ordered Salmon. I thought if Emeril Lagasse is associated with this steakhouse then the fish selections would be first rate. I was not wrong ! I enjoyed the crabcake appetizer -  it was just supurb. The BBQ Salmon was astoundingly good and cooked to perfection.  A wealth of flavor in every bite.  The steaks ordered by the rest of the table were huge and exceedingly good. The table shared a chocolate blackberry cake for desert and it was the perfect pair for a fine selection of tawny Port. Once again, the service provided by the staff was excellent throughout the meal.  Simply an amazing dining experience. First class all the way ...........",

For appetizer, we ordered Classic Steak Tartare, it came with bread and dip too, it just vaporized in our mouth. And ordered antipasto for the table to get us warmed up. The presentation of each item deserves a standing applause.   We were four of us, but we ordered plenty of items to pamper ourselves.  For Main entre, we ordered Ribeye, Filet Mignon, ROASTED HEIRLOOM TOMATO RAVIOLI, Truffle and Parmesan Potato chips and for the desert Caramel Butter Cake and DUCK EGG CREME BRULEE, WOW.   We had a Vegetarian friend, the choices are too less and for that choice, the quantity was too little. They had to ordered two main entre along with appetizers to fill the tummy.  Wiating might be a problem to visit on a rush day, but we were lucky. Ambience is very sophesticted, formal dressing would be nice.  Also we ordered couple of wine bottles, one was cahors wine clos la coutale, the other was too hazy to remember.   Overall, this place is just worth to visit for their medium rare Steak, Yumm",

However, I'm happy to say we had a very enjoyable visit with good food and good company.  We started off with the seafood tower.  Yummy shrimp for me and crab legs, lobster tail, tuna tartare and oysters for everyone else.  A fun appetizer for a group.  Everything was fresh and tasty!  I wasn't overly hungry when I went, so I kept my meal pretty light with the ravioli appetizer.  This was very good; perfect for something small but filling.  Hubby decided on the sea bass, which he gets a lot at various restaurants.  He really enjoyed it and said it was cooked perfectly.  The whole table split some sides:  creamed spinach (not overly creamy but still tasty), creamed corn (the BEST!) and fingerling potatoes (nothing special but liked them).  And of course, dessert could not be missed even though I was verging on miserable.  Churros were stinking good and the key lime pie might very well be the best I'd ever tasted.  Overall, a good meal.  An A-OK visit.  I will admit once I discovered this was an Emeril restaurant, I expected to be wowed on like 17 different levels. I wasn't, but I still enjoyed it all the same.",

    "text": "A completely unremarkable experience. Let's be clear, most of us aren't going to this kind of place just for a $60 steak - we're going for the experience of an upscale steakhouse.  This restaurant doesn't know what it wants to be. It's not old-school enough to be a classic steakhouse, and it's not contemporary enough to be cool. It feels very much like a hotel restaurant, lacking any distinct character.  It was a little disappointing to arrive for our reservation, and to have the hostess simply say \"your table will be ready in a few minutes\". No invitation to sit in the lounge, or to get a drink at the bar. We kind of stood awkwardly in the foyer area until we were called after a couple of minutes.   After that, the service was pretty great. The head waiter and waiter were friendly and attentive, and would fit well in a classic steakhouse that doesn't take itself overly seriously. Please excuse the snobby words you are about to read, but, to go back to expectations of an establishment like this - I found it a bit of a miss that my beer bottle and glass were brought to the table but not poured, and that the crumbs were not cleared from the table between our soup/salad/popover starters and the main course.  For dinner, we had the 16 oz ribeye, filet mignon, and sides of potato gratin and asparagus. The potato was easily the star of the meal - absolutely delicious and served in a hot serving dish - and the asparagus was well prepared. The meat itself was fine, prepared as ordered, but unexceptional. The ribeye's seasoning was ordinary (no Creole uniqueness), and the filet was almost over-seasoned which detracted from the cut itself.  Overall, if you're seeking an upscale steak dinner, look elsewhere. This is an average experience and not at all on par with other establishments. Since it is probably the most inexpensive of the steakhouses in the Strip area, I imagine it would be good for a larger group that wants a steakhouse outing.",

My friend took over the reigns this evening having dined here before but soon become too ill to even enjoy his dinner. That's what a day of drinking will do to someone. The restaurant itself is nice but super quiet and more of a older crowd. I personally prefer a more upbeat energetic vibe when I am out in Vegas. The food was nothing special, my filet was prepared medium rare but lacked anything spectacular. Service was also so so our server changed maybe three times and the best part about the dinner was when we got the check. I'm sure it was an off night but the restaurant wasn't busy and maybe that says something as well.",

My sister NEVER complains. She hates it. And even she said something. The manager came over and spoke to her and said \"so you're sending half back?\" And walked away almost rolling his eyes. My mom and sister split the steak. My sister was hungry and powered through. My mom could not. And his attitude was just gross.   Two stars for apps and service of the main waitress. The rest docked for sub sub sub par steaks and an jerk manager with nasty 'tude.",

I got the bone in ribeye which was fine but nothing special. The baked potato was also only mediocre.   Dessert was probably the highlight. The butterscotch pudding was excellent.   Even though the food didn't stack up to my expectations the service was excellent. Very attentive and accommodating.",

The creekstone angus sandwhich was awesome. Like a cross between focaccia and ciabatta bread filled with tender pieces of nicely salted steak, roasted mushrooms and onions, and a very fitting horseradish mayo. I liked it so much I almost ordered a second but it was very filling. The onion rings were not special but the sandwich more than made up for it. The banana creme parfait was also good and lightly sweet which I prefer. The rest of the party enjoyed the duck egg creme brulee. Pretty classy place overall and we were lucky it was the end of lunch so we had the place to ourselves.",

If you are there for a special occasion let them know in advance. Maybe they will give you a yummy desert. They have a gumbo that is just so wonderful, it is hard to describe, it it thick, but not so thick you are so full you can't eat anything else. All of the steaks are the best and cooked to perfection. Know, that if you order it rare, that is what you will get. They know exactly how to make a steak. All of the appetizers are great. The wine list is over priced, like most of Las Vegas, so have it if you must, but maybe just a drink is better. The deserts are so tasty. You will love Delmonico's and you want to return. Enjoy.",

The staff was professional and attentive. Just a couple minutes before our entrees had arrived, my boyfriend stepped away from the table. Our server brought plate covers to keep our food warm while I waited for him to return. I noticed that our server was lingering within eye-shot of our table so that he could remove the warmers when my boyfriend returned to the table. I was very impressed. The food was also amazing. I got the lobster bisque to start and the filet Oscar style as my entree. The lobster bisque was the best I have ever had. The filet was really flavorful and tender. The crab was wonderful and the bearnaise was exceptional. My boyfriend got the baby iceberg lettuce salad to start and the Wagyu ribeye as his entree. We also got the broccoli as a side. He liked the salad pretty well and his ribeye was wonderful. We would definitely eat here again.",

The service here was excellent.  The atmosphere was American classic.  The noise level was moderate.  We were able to have a very good conversation where the whole table of 6 was engaged the entire time.  The cocktail menu was imaginative and the Old Fashioned's tasted nearly as good as mine.  The wine list was interesting and navigated well by one of my work colleagues.  The popovers to start as the bread option was a nice touch.  Popovers were \"a thing\" in my youth, my Mom loved them, and for me it's always sweet to have them in a restaurant.  For my entree I had the filet mignon and it was perfect.  Others in our party had the bone in rib eye and the bone in sirloin ... all were happy.  We ordered 3/4 of the sides on the menu and all were well done.   We all ordered dessert and 1/2 the table went with the banana cream pie and the other 1/2 with key lime, both were good, but the key lime was the winner.

We started out with the fried oysters and the petite wedge salads. The oysters were incredibly fresh and crispy. Do the pro move and ask the waiter to bring out some crystals hot sauce to put on the top if you really want to make it Cajun, also smeared some blue cheese on top of mine from my wife salad which made it over the top good. For the main course we split the Chateaubriand and the cut was really  nice and seasoned and came with a side of asparagus and Lebanese potatoes. On our next visit I think we will stick with getting just the bone in ribeye as it looked a little better and then ordering our sides ala carte. For dessert we had the banana cream pie which was not overly sweet and the contrast  with the chocolate shavings on top giving it that slight bitter taste mixing with that creamy goodness.  The cappuccino was very good and was the excellent end cap to an extraordinary meal.",

Excellent wine list--featuring Reds and Bordeaux in particular.  Every course was impeccably good.    The bone-in Rib Eye steak and Filet mignon were truly succulent.  The Creme Brulee was unparalleled.  I recommend this restaurant with highest regard.",

With a show later, I made an early reservation for Delmonico.  I was promptly greeted and seated.  I knew the steaks were large unless I got a petit filet (not my favorite cut of steak) so I ordered a bone in ribeye, a side of cheesy grits with bacon, and then bread pudding for dessert. I had a trio of servers who took good care of service.    I ordered the steak cooked blue and it was close to that but a bit beyond.  The steak was quite average.  The steak was pre-seasoned and it was OK.  The star of dinner was the cheesy grits with bacon.  They were very good!  The bread pudding was white chocolate macadamia nut with creme Anglaise.  It was OK, too.  The dinner never had any wow factor to merit the prices charged.  Things were average except the grits.  I thought the dried branches on the poinsettia on the wall by my table reflected the lack of attention to detail one would expect of a high end restaurant like Delmonico.    Service was very good and the servers were friendly but I left feeling somewhat disappointed.  Well, at least there'll be no need to stop and peruse the menu anymore.",

Any time a variable is add to the title I usually questions it. But when I found we had seats at This place I went to google.   \"Best steakhouse in Vegas\" I read with no extra words to misled the public. Now I'm ready.   First thing i noticed is the low lighting and Elegant atmosphere. First glance you would think this place is strictly for high rollers with a private jet parked across the street. However it wasn't a strict dress code.  I saw customers with  tailored suits as we'll as shorts and polo shirts. My suggestion would be to step it up a little bit simply because you are in Vegas.   I will not talk about the price of the meal because when I used Yelp to checking I got a high rollers badge. That means his place is very expensive. Let's just say it was 12 of us and the bill was over $1200 dollars.   I ordered a drink called \"THE BRONTE SISTERS\" that came to the table in a mid Evil looking copper glass. Then I order another and another. Best drink I've ever had. Beware there isn't any prices on the drink menu but these babies run about 16 bucks. Yikes (disclaimer: I had a good day at the crap tables so I could splurge a bit)   For started I ordered an Emeril Lagasse BBQ Shrimp with fresh baked Rosemary biscuit. The biscuits was very small but so freaking tasteful. After all the shrimp was devoured I was left with this amazing sauce on the bottom of the plate. If I didn't care if people looked at me like a homeless man with his first meal I would've licked the plate. No lie it was that good.  When the waiter took my plate with all that sauce left I felt like i violated a crime in flavor town.   Now the real reason I'm writing this review THE BONE IN DRY AGED RIBEYE. lord have mercy on my taste buds. Best steak ever.  All that needs to be said.  This is the drop the mic moment and walk off stage.",

Ladies and Gentlemen, I am a well reputed burger aficionado. I'm a burger snob. Be it greasy spoon or gourmet i'm on a perpetual hunt of the best burger in America. That illusive cheeseburger is my Moby Dick.   You must understand, to be top ten worthy -- a burger really must impress. It must cause unmitigated joy - a giant grin - and compulsive participation in what I call \"The happy burger dance\". While Del Monico makes a delicious burger, I aspire to something simply ONE step above where this burger stands.   There's nothing wrong with it really. The ingredients are top notch. Kudos for the richest REDDEST, fully Flavorful tomatoes I have EVER seen served on a burger in America. We're talking tomatoes a southerner with a home garden would be proud of. We're not talking those waxy pink tomatoes most ppl use. Or the red ones without flavor. We're talking picked from the vine still warm from the sun ripe.  The steak burger is two fisted burger. Juicy 'slutty' beef (any burger that'll soak my fries with juices is fondly known as a slutty burger) sadly the meat was without remarkable flavor, mildly seasoned. A purist burger, sesame seed bun. Melty cheddar bacon good flavor not great -- no crisp.   The Fries fried in bacon fat, crispy not dirty. Low flavor still good. Purist fries .  Soft bread and butter pickle chunk atop a good clean pure burger without sass.   Huge.  So big I wasn't sure if I ate it or it ate me. Honestly, this was the biggest burger I've ever tried to eat on my own. I think I made it halfway through. *LOL*  Good plain burger, well executed. A purist burger. Exceptional quality ingredients with nice flavor only it lacks the artful symphony of flavors I need to happy dance. I did cracked a smile but no happy dance. And that's why this burger only ranks *Honorable Mention* (about #11 on my list)  Put some seasoning on that meat. Add a little garlic powder to that salt and pepper. Bring your A game and give that burger some sass, we know you know how to bring the sass Emeril!",

The Tower has lobster, shrimp, tuna, oysters, Alaskan king crab. Wow, talk about a carnival in your mouth! The Seafood is fresh and sweet.  I ordered the bone-in ribeye. It was a very large cut! It could have easily been shared. The steak comes a la carte so you have to also order side dishes. The sides are mostly vegetables as options (broccoli, scalloped potatoes, creamed spinach, asparagus, mushrooms). The steak was cooked perfectly and it was perfectly seasoned too. The sides were delicious too.  At Dessert time, You must try Emeril's signature Banana Cream Pie. It is nice and light. Not sweet, light, just right. It is my most favorite dish at Emeril's restaurants! A must try!  Delmonico's is pricey but delicious!",

We sat in the bar and had a wonderful server. Very personable, accommodating and very nice. The atmosphere is still the same great upbeat, fun and relaxing (yes all at the same time). The drinks were good as well.  The thing that lacked was the seafood tower. The highlight of the meal, the thing we were looking forward to the most, what we were drooling for. A couple of the dipping sauces were delicious but their substitute for cocktail sauce tasted like marinara sauce. Overly sweet and not a good mix with shrimp. Maybe I am biased because I love the kick of horseradish in my cocktail sauce. The biggest complaint though, was the seafood felt dry or freezer burned. We still ate it because I wasn't going to let them waste the food and was in too much of a good mood to complain, but for the $, maybe I should have.   So this trip was a love hate. We got way better service but the food lacked and isn't that what should rock my world at a restaurant of this caliber?",

Here's how my conversation with our waiter began:  Me: \"What kind of bread is this?\" Waiter: \"They're popovers sir.\" Me: \"Has anyone ever commented that they're shaped like dicks?\"  Waiter: \"Haha, no sir, very good observation sir.\"   Yup, their popovers were pretty much shaped like dicks. They were a bit cold, oily, and combined with the refrigerated butter (one of my pet peeves at restaurants), a big disappointment. Despite the phallic start to dinner, the rest of the meal and service was excellent.   The recommended lobster bisque was a great way to cleanse my palate of that bread. There were big chunks of lobster meat and the bisque was well-seasoned without going overboard with the salt. Delmonico is known for their bone-in ribeye so I ordered that medium-rare. The steak was more on the medium side, but no complaints here as it was just as juicy and tender. No steak is complete without a side of creamed spinach, which was done well. All sides are portioned to be shared. Despite a misstep with my friend's order (bone-in NY strip instead of boneless), service was spot on.",

For the main course We each had a different cut of meat. That was so we could \"share experiences\" and explore the menu. It was a great idea. I had Ribeye, my husband had the bone in ribeye, my brother had the filet and my mother had the filet prime special. Omg! All was juice, perfectly cooked and promptly brought to the table! Our sides were delectable!! Creamed corn and potatoes gratin accompanied the steaks perfectly. Honestly, the only thing lacking in my opinion was the overly simple decor!

That was very helpful since we were all in Vegas for a race the next day.  Our lead server, Tom, was spectacular!  He was truly helpful in giving us recommendations and extremely knowledgeable about the menu.    I got the barbecue shrimp which was phenomenal. The shrimp was done to perfection and the sauce was delicious. The biscuit was a little bit hard but not as important as everything else.  They also served popovers on the table instead of bread. The popovers were chewy and gummy and I would've preferred some other type of bread on the table. Maybe they're not fantastic at making bread.   I got the special of a bone in filet mignon cooked rare. The rare was done perfectly! I was very impressed.  I also got the grits and the creamed corn for side dishes. Their grits were a little bit grainy for my taste although the flavor was good. The creamed corn was fabulous!  Our table pretty much ordered one of every dessert. I ordered the banana cream pie based on a friend's recommendation. I have to say that was not my favorite but that's because I don't care for bananas in my dessert. My bad since I knew that. The banana cream pie was extremely dense with bananas. However I traded with another friend who got the pecan pie in the oatmeal cookie crust. Oh my gosh that was heaven!!    The dinner was superb and the service was excellent! I would return here again in the future and I would recommend it to anyone visiting Vegas.",

My husband shared the Chateaubriand Carved Tableside for Two, Asparagus and Garlic Smashed Potatoes for  $110 - Same as the Filet however, it comes with sides and costs less.  It was prepared PERFECTLY and was delicious from the first bite to the last bite.    Other sides folks had and loved were: New Orleans Creamed Spinach;  Twice Baked Potato with Bacon and Vermont Cheddar The wine we chose (we asked for a med-full bodied red with a smooth finish and complex aromas that didn't cost more than $100 or $1000 (see photo of wine prices)  He actually suggested something for around $60 or so and it was exquisite!   Chappellet Mountain Cuvee 2009.  Add this to your to do list in Vegas and go hungry!!  Don't be shy to ask for a wine within your price range... they don't carry any bad wines so why pay a thousand bucks for wine?  LOVED THIS RESTAURANT!",

    "text": "I recently entertained clients here.  I made my reservation over Open Table.  Originally I had made for 4 people, then wanted to add one more guest.  They told me several times that there was no way they could fit another chair at the table.  Ok.  We get there, and there is a private party going on - but in the lobby/bar/wait area.  What?  That's a bit disturbing.  They sat us in the lounge area and we ordered drinks (which never came).  Then our \"table\" was ready.  Well this was the end table which basically was in the lounge area.  So we moved over one table.   The wine list is very in depth and almost overwhelming.  Just give me a good red with my meat is not the way to go here.  No simplicity.  From the start our table was crowded.  Too many items on the tables, and the service ware was oversized for the little table.  It almost made it difficult to eat.  Before our food came I wondered off to the loo - which was like a hike because the restaurant is actually quite huge.  As I walked by tables, I saw several larger tables with less people seated at them and empty chairs.  Hmmm.  So they really couldn't let me bring an extra guest or they really don't know how to plan their seating?    During our meal we couldn't even talk - the noise from the private party was too much.  And they were standing all around us.  Several time people knocked into the back of my clients' chair!  So frustrating.  I can't understand WHY they would seat people in that area - and we had plenty of room for the extra guest.    The food was wonderful.  Meat done right.  But all the negatives earn this only 2 stars.",

Both were lacking. After getting seated, I had to request a black napkin, which is usually automatic. Not a big deal. After waiting for 5-10 mins, perusing the menu on our own, I had to ask a busboy to find the waiter so I could order drinks. He finally came over and asked if I had any questions and proceeded to recommend the entire menu. Not helpful. We ordered the organic green salad which was excellent. Also got the bone in ribeye. I liked the way it was charred on the outside but it was not well seasoned and the meat quality wasn't top notch like other steakhouses I've been to. The manager came by to do their customary check and I told him the steak was 'pretty good'. He didn't bother asking me why I wasn't satisfied, smiled and walked away.  Overall, this place doesn't command the price they're charging. Need to clean up their service and food quality. If the salad was the best thing we ate at a steakhouse, that's definitely a problem.",

I kind of treat Vegas like a giant tapas restaurant and basically go from restaurant to restaurant having an app and drink at each stop so I cannot comment on their food or service other than the apps that I have had there which have been delicious.  Max Solano is Emeril's master mixologist in Vegas and I believe he creates all the signature cocktails for Emeril's Vegas properties or maybe it's just the Venetian/Palazzo properties. Whatever the case may be this man can make a drink. Do yourself a favor and sit and the bar when Max is working and let him design or recommend a drink based on your personal tastes. I have given him just two ingredients that I was craving and had him invent a cocktail for the first time right there in front of me that would rate as the best I have ever had. He is a True artist behind the bar. He also boasts what is one of the most extensive whiskey inventories in the country!  A cocktail or two by Max is a great way to start or end an evening and sometimes both in the same sitting but either way add a Solano cocktail to your Vegas must do list the next time you visit Vegas.",

The bacon wilted spinach salad is bomb!  I have never enjoyed a salad or steak this good.  I make it a point to stop by this place when I am in Vegas.    Went back in September and the restaurant has lost it.  Ordered the bone in ribeye and it tasted like death. The maitre d, said the meat was over aged.

We had the seafood tower, which was great except for the tuna tartare on the top - the tuna did not taste fresh at all.  Some of us got the summer prix fix option, which sounded like a great deal for $65.  All the appetizers were good, especially the tomato soup/grilled cheese.  Then the entrees came.  I had the petite ribeye, and it was seriously the worst steak I ever had.  It tasted like cheap top sirloin from Sizzler, really tough & chewy.  Emeril would be ashamed if he tasted it.  My daughter ordered off the regular menu and had the bone-in ribeye, which was delicious.  Maybe it was my fault for ordering the prix fix... I understand it's cheaper... but the quality was so poor and definitely no way near $65.  I'm giving them 2 stars for good appetizers but will be staying away from the prix fix menu.",

This is a chain restaurant so some might be skeptical, but overall I think this is one of the better restaurants of the chain (as I have been to several of the Delmonico restaurants). The service was great as usual and for the price point of the steak, I think one of the more affordable steakhouses in Las Vegas for what you get.   The bone-in rib eye - cooked to perfect medium rare and the one thing that Delmonico's adds to their steaks is a big chunk of herb butter that just adds so much more flavor to the steak (although you know its bad for you, you just want more!).   Sides - great for sharing and we had the mixed mushrooms, creamed spinach and creamed corn. Not the best sides that I've had, but they were good.  Overall, a great option for a steakhouse in The Venetian and in Las Vegas.",

The oysters, ahi tuna & salmon tartare, butternut squash ravioli, and bbq shrimp are all excellent choices for starters and the potato gratin is a good side dish to have the steak with. The wine list is very extensive, but if you're not up for all that intensive reading, they also have a very knowledgeable staff to make recommendations. I was a little disappointed with peppermint profiteroles which were a little too stiff for my liking. Service was great and efficient. I must have had my water glass filled 7-8 times that night. Pricing is relatively decent - entrees around $50 and starters/sides/deserts around $10-$15 each.",

    "text": "Delmonico Steakhouse was pretty good, but definitely not the best I've had nor without flaws.  The food and drink choices seem to be where they really excel, as there were a number of options that my girlfriend and I found to be mouth-watering, from the bone-in ribeye, the fillet, the chicken, salmon, etc.  They had my favorite beer (Chimay Blue) and she enjoyed her wine (she had the Chardonnay and Riesling).  What we wanted when going here was a nice, fancy dinner as a tribute to our vacation together.  It wasn't a special occasion or anything but we like to have a quality dinner from time to time.  I'd say the food part of Emeril's more or less did the trick with regards to that.  The service was OK.  While they were relatively prompt the matre'd was the person who seemed to be serving us and he was just a little too over-the-top for me, not to mention he seemed a little condescending and careless.  Perhaps I just read into it wrong, but I didn't feel as comfortable as I have at other restaurants.  Our waiters made sure the waters and bread kept coming, which I appreciated.  The matre'd didn't really do anything rude per-say, but I did notice that at one point when he came by to check on everything he spoke with the tables on our left and right but not with us.    The smaller tables are a little too big IMO, my girlfriend and I felt a mile away from each other and eventually I just moved my place settings next to her and sat with her so we could talk easier.  This is probably not an issue if you have a big group, but for a romantic evening it wasn't fantastic.  Speaking of romance, there were no candles, the lightning was bright, and the restaurant was devoid of decor.   I don't mean to rip Delmonico's so much but I just want to stress that this restaurant really doesn't deserve 5 stars despite the food being pretty tasty.  Our stakes came out medium rare as requested, they were juicy and delicious, and the side \"double-baked potato\" + \"Asparagus\" was fantastic.  I realized going here and glancing at the menu online that the prices were going to be steep but I guess my wallet received a shock even so.  I had initially been hoping that our bill would come to about $115-130, but in the end it was $200 because you have to buy sides for your meal separately and the wine / beer was very expensive.  The problem with this is that in Vegas there is a lot of competition and I've had food that was on par with this for under half the price of what I paid.  For instance Mon Ami Gabi (outside of Paris, Paris) and Trevi (Ceasar's Palace Forum Shops) both run in the $60-100 range (for two) and are just as tasty IMO.  Lastly, there were a nat or two flying around toward the end of our meal, something which is unacceptable in a restaurant of this caliber.    I enjoyed the overall experience but I would not dine here again.",

    "text": "My friend and I really wanted to try one of the best steakhouses in Vegas, and people kept telling us about how great Delmonico was, so we gave it a try. It was my friend's birthday dinner and she is a huge meat eater, I on the other hand don't actually like steak all that much, but WOW! It is absolutely impossible not to enjoy your meal here.   We were in a rush because we had tickets to a show and we were already running late. We advised our maitre d' that we had barely one hour to eat dinner and be on our way. He went above and beyond to make sure we got service fast and made the show on time. Not only was he absolutely efficient in making sure our food came out quickly, but he was also super friendly and attentive with us.   Our cocktails took no time at all to arrive and were done perfectly. We didn't have time to get appetizers which was a big disappointment, so we went straight for the main course. I had the rib eye and smashed potatoes, my friend had the fillet Mignon and fingerling potatoes, and we also shared some buttered asparagus. All the food was top notch and delicious. My rib eye was cooked to a perfect medium rare, and was well seared on the outside. Like I said, I don't particularly like steak but this was mind blowing amazing! I had a few bites of my friend's fillet Mignon and it was melt in your mouth goodness. I don't know that it could be possible, but it was even better than my rib eye. Amazing.   The sides were also very good, specially the country smashed potatoes which were buttery and creamy. They had bacon and what I think were leeks in them. Yum. The asparagus were cooked to perfection and seasoned just right. I did not try the fingerling but my friend said she wasn't overly impressed by them.   My friend was also surprised with an apple cider sorbet and a candle - for her birthday. The sorbet was delicious, light and refreshing. All in all our visit to Delmonico was fantastic and worth every single dollar we paid. Dinner here is pricey, but seriously if you find yourself in Las Vegas, you'd be crazy not to come here!",

We were a bit Steak'd out after 3 nights of dining and so decided on the Fried Chicken thinking how bad could it be - OMG - you've got to try it.  The bone in filet was also scrumptious - even rare.  The pecan pie desert was straight out of my home town in the South.  Four 4 people I almost fell off my chair when I got the bill it was so low.  For incredible food, exemplary service, great value and a beautiful atmosphere to eat in - ya gotta try Delmonico's... Who knew???  WOW",

I had a filet ordered medium to medium well black, it showed up well done with no char whatsoever.  My friend ordered hers blue and it showed up rare. My husband's was fine but like I said super fatty. The other friends was over cooked as well along with the snottiest looking disgusting foie gras I have ever seen. Bottom line_ you go to Vegas to have a great meal and it sucked.  All of it sucked. Go somewhere else for $100pp.",

But among all the steakhouses I've been to, I've enjoyed them all, including this one.  The bone-in ribeye steak I had was good, but not great (i.e. blow my mind).  The tomato salad was good, well-balanced, not too heavy.  Garlic mashed potatoes were ok, nothing special. The sauteed mushrooms were good, but I've had better.  Ambiance and service were good, I must say.  The waiters were attentive and came by when needed.  The lighting is dark, but not too dark.  Overall,  a solid and relatively good eating and dining experience.",

My feet were tired from standing up all three days and didn't want to leave the hotel for dinner.    Had the following: *BBQ Shrimp: tasty sauce but the shrimp was OVERCOOKED!!!  Tough chewing. *Vine ripened tomato salad with burrata: It says \"torn local basil\"... Now how corny is that... and me being more &itchy.... it wasn't torn... they were cut as chiffonade.  I wouldn't thought this but really.....\"torn local basil\".. give me a break..  This was what was expected.  Can you really screw up sliced tomatoes, slapped on burrata on top, \"torn local basil\", red onion, virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar?  My friend's 4 year old daughter can make this dish. *Filet Mignon-medium rare: was the toughest filet mignon I EVER HAD!!!  WTF?!?!?  It was cooked correctly, but TOUGH at $50 for 9oz.  The filet I had at Outback was much more tender.  *Grits w/bacon and white cheddar: If you like steel cut oats, you'll like this, which I do.  Not creamy like most grits.  Has texture. *Banana cream pie: OMG... I LOVE banana cream pie, but this was really bad.  The cream was sooo thick it was almost like a dense cake.  It looks impressive because of the layers of banana.  The flavor wasn't there. Safeways' banana cream pie is MUCH BETTER!!   I also had a cocktail and a glass of red wine.  My meal came up to almost $200.  I don't mind paying the price if the food was worth it... IT WAS NOT!!!    Not coming back here again.  1 star for the waitress who was very attentive 1 star for the hostess who got me a table quickly",

I had the chopped salad for lunch, which was huge and had lot of everything in it.  I'm not sure if there is a separate lunch menu from the dinner menu, but I did find out bill quite pricey considering it was for lunch and no one had a steak!",

We were so exhausted that we didn't even bother pretty-ing ourselves up before hand...dumped out bags and headed straight to dinner.  We were worried that our shorts and flip-flop attire wasn't going to cut it but aside from some dirty stares from some of the other guests, the wait staff kindly turned their heads.    The service was impeccable.   They started us off with a goat cheese puff pastry to cleanse our pallets, compliments of the chef.  All of us buddied up and ordered the Bone-in Ribeye Steak...which was plenty to go around.  Tasty, it sure was but I'd have to say, I've had better.  The garlic mushrooms, creamed corn, cheddar bacon grits, and sauteed asparagus sides were great compliments set in the middle of the table for all of us to share.  We were seated at a circular table which was ideal for conversation instead of screaming across a long table.  By dessert, we were stuffed...next time for sure.    Since we didn't order any wine to compliment the dinners that we all split, Delmonico left the robbing of our $$ to the casinos.  I know if I went with just my boyfriend, it'd be one less night we could stay at the Venetian.",

    "text": "The service here is VERY mixed.  The first time I came (months ago), the host/hostess was NOWHERE to be found for like 10 minutes when I arrived for my party's reservation.  Then once someone was at the front desk, she totally ignored my existence and we stood there for another ten minutes.  Then some guy finally comes and I'm like I had reservations for so and so time and he is like I'm sorry, we just had a large party come in so there may be a bit of a wait.    OK?  That was a first.  I was expecting a little more attentiveness from a restaurant like this.  And it was kind off-putting to have had reservations at a restaurant of this calibre not honored.  We were told to wait in the bar area, where we were not even offered so much as a glass of water, and then ignored for another 15 minutes by the hostess until we decided to leave.  THE NEXT DAY, someone calls me and is like you missed your reservation last night.  Um NO, we were there and waited for about 45 minutes and left.  Then he was apologetic and offered to comp our dinner if we were to come back, but I was flying out that day and had to decline that offer.  Then he proceeded to ask for my address so that they could send a gift card.  I was like ok sure.  I was surprised that the gift card was for as much as it was.  It was very generous of them.  On to the visit where I actually got to eat!  The mister and I came during lunch time on a Sunday.  Again, the hostess was nowhere to be found for the first 5 minutes or so.  Then she comes out and is like there is going to be a wait (I had reservations, yet again.)  So we sat at the bar, where the very attentive (and I guess new) bartender proceeded to hand us menus.  Then we were like ehh we'll just eat at the bar.  A couple minutes later, the hostess was finally like oh ok are you guys eating here?  We started with the Potato Chips with Truffle Oil and Parmesan MMMMM!!  For my entree, I had the Gulf Shrimp with fettucine and preserved lemon.  The shrimp was very juicy and fresh-tasting.  The bartender, who ended up being pretty much our server was very nice, attentive, and actually really fun to talk to.  So despite the initial situation, four stars for the delicious food, service at the bar, and the lengths the management went to make up for the mistake.",

We were a little early for our reservation so we sat in the bar and ordered a few drinks.  The hostess then called our name after only a couple of minutes so we did not get our drinks in the bar but they brought them to the table and added them to our bill.  It was a very smooth process.  For dinner, I had the fillet Mignon with blue cheese melted on it.  It was delicious.  The steak was a tad undercooked for my taste but I did order medium rare.  I guess I was expecting the norm where other restaurants cook medium rare closer to medium.  But overall the steak was delicious.  Good flavor and I loved the blue cheese.  My mom had the rack of lamb.  Again a little too undercooked for her taste but they truly cooked it to medium rare.  We shared the twice baked potatoes with cheese and bacon.  Yummy!  The bread was good too.  We had a great main waiter and his assistants.  Everyone treated us well and in a timely manner.  Definitely a place I will go again.",

    "text": "I came here back in 2005 with my family and had a phenomenally memorable meal. Six years later -- I came back this past weekend and it was STELLAR. Extensive wine list, excellent service, ridiculously buttery brioche bread, great cocktails, and of course, the food!  For apps, my party had the truffle chips (so rich but delish!), squash ravioli with duck confit (superb), lobster bisque (mmm with large lobster chunks), and the wedge salad (as perfect as a classic wedge gets).   For entrees, I had the filet mignon that was PERFECTLY cooked to a True medium-rare. I often find that, when I order med-rare, more often than not, highly rated restaurants overcook my meat to more of a med to med-well, which is can be disappointing. Well, here at Delmonico, it was PERFECT! Friends got the bone-in ribeye and the huge $85 Fred Flinstone steak (I forget the official name), all cooked to perfection. The 2007 Joseph Phelps Cab paired divinely with the steaks.   Sides:  creamed corn was mind-blowing; creamed spinach was good but didn't knock my socks off (compared to everything else which did).   We were too stuffed to order a dessert, but we received a complimentary birthday gelato. Nice gesture, but it was not so great -- I think it was a non-conventional flavor, like fennel or something?  Overall, I would definitely return the next time I'm in the mood for a (pricey) steak dinner in Vegas!!! Emeril is a genius!",

    "text": "Food: 4  Service: 2.5   Delmonico's was one of the first fancy-schmanchy places I'd eaten at in Vegas. However the last time I ate there was close to five years ago and I've eaten at many other places since then. My husband was eager to try it out again to see if it was as good as he remembered it to be.  In summary, I'd say the food was good, the service- not so much.  We were lead to our table in the back of the restaurant and even though it was nearly 10:00 pm, the restaurant was really crowded. I was pretty surprised but perhaps this is part of the reason we didn't receive the greatest service.  For the appetizer, I had ordered some sort of tomato salad thing from the specials that sounded really interesting. In fact, it was one of the items the server had recommended. However, about 5-10 minutes after ordering, the server came by and informed me they were out of it and asked me if I would like to order something else. The weird thing was, he wasn't apologetic at all, he simply said something along the lines of, \"We're out of that, do you want to get another salad?\" I'm not going to say he was downright rude but for a restaurant of this caliber, I definitely expected at the very least, some sort of apology. Perhaps even a free appetizer or dessert but perhaps I'm expecting too much? I settled on the salad with goat cheese and I do have to say it was delicious, one of the tastiest salads I can remember having in a long time. However, the journey in getting to that salad was a little bumpy. My husband had a pretty standard garden salad that I tasted and it was pretty good too.  Another problem with our ordering is when I tried to order my filet and they asked how I wanted it cooked, I told them my usual method of between medium and medium well, no blood. Okay, I know I am a little difficult but I've never had a problem with a place accommodating my request so at a high end steakhouse, I did not even consider that this would be a difficult task. Well, our server just flat out said he didn't think he could do that. Uhhh, what? Really? It's as if the steak was being cooked in a microwave with only set levels. It was so weird. So I was a little miffed. With that being said, my steak and my husband's steak was cooked properly when it came out. Just a shame that I had to get hazed about it when ordering. All our sides (grits, mushrooms, and spinach) had very generous portions and were pretty good too but perhaps but no real standouts either.  Even though the steaks were a few dollars pricier than other comparable steakhouse such as Carnevino, I did appreciate that the three steak sauces came free. Other places charge $2-$3 per sauce so it really balanced out and it was nice to try all three.  I can never resist dessert so I got something I believed was some sort of banana tart. I was surprised when something resembling a big hunk of mud pie with a giant mound of whip cream came out. I took a few bites but it was a bit overwhelming for me.  All in all, I would say the food was good but not as good as I remembered it five years ago. Or perhaps I've been spoiled by the different restaurants I've been to since then. My biggest complaint was the service- not only the issues as stated above but just overall, the service felt impersonal and disjointed. I would have to guess that since the restaurant seemed very busy and it was near the end of the night by the time of our reservation, the servers had probably run out of patience. Understandable, we've all had bad days at work but I don't like feeling like the scapegoat.  I still wouldn't hesitate in recommending Delmonico's to people since my food was good but perhaps I'd recommend a reservation earlier in the day and hope that would alleviate the service issues.",

The servers were always around and very friendly. The bread was amazing, never had one exactly like it before. We started with the truffle chips which were amazing! The chips aren't 100% evenly cooked/flavored but they were totally worth taking the leftovers to our hotel room. They didn't get all soggy the next day. For my meal we had the lobster sliders. When I took a bite it was something I didn't except at all but it was still delicious. LOTS of lobster meat as well. The bread is warm but the meat is cool and it blends well together instead of clashing. We were too full after that but would love to come back and try some more items.",

    "text": "Definitely a fan of this place. Reminds me of a cross between my local favorites Ruth Chris in Irvine, Ca & Mortons in Santa Ana, Ca. Great service of course, awesome wine selection. Came her for my 40th & knew I was going to have steak so I went with their bone in ribeye & it was definitely not a mistake, no steak sauce necessary & never should need it at a good steak house. I'm never partial to chicken at more expensive places (I just don't see the point, may as well go all out & get the beef) but my wife had their roasted chicken & I had a taste of it & it was the most flavorful chicken dish I've ever had. I may just have to go against my favorites & get that the next time. All in all this place should be a 5 star but I've only been there once, I may adjust once I go back again in the new year.",

One thing I find in many upscale steakhouses is a somewhat limited menu with only a handful of entrees and appetizers to choose from.  Delmoico's has an expansive menu and everything was delicious.  the atmosphere and food made for a great night out... definitely try if you are looking for a nice night out (for steak) in Vegas!",

We had stated on our reservations that it was was our anniversary. We got no acknowledgement of it and were seated at the worst table in the restaurant in a corner with a cheap floor lamp that was covered in dust next to us. No one was even in the restaurant, so they could have given us a nice booth. It was still dead there at 6:30 when we left. On to the food. Popovers were just ok. Hubby's ribeye was yummy. My filet however, was dry as the Sahara and had no flavor. Not a speck of juice ran out when I cut into it. My hubby said it looked like jerky. So disappointed. Sides creamed spinach and twice baked potato were just ok. Twice baked was just a big greasy glob of cheese and wasn't even hot. For dessert, we got the banana cream pie. It was good but I was expecting it to wow me based on what others had said about it. Sadly, I don't think I'll be back. For the price, I'd rather have Mastros or Ruth's Chris.",

    "text": "LAS VEGAS...i have so many unforgettable memories...  i first came to this sin city on a cold winter night with my college roommates.  the youngest of us had just turned 21 and we needed to prove we were adults.  back then, new york new york was the hottest hotel on the strip and we went crazy, imitating diana ross and the supremes (i would say we were the original \"dreamgirls\" and i have pictures to prove it).  we couldn't afford a lobster for each person, so we shared 1 among 4 of us. we were young, naive, dirt poor and shameless.    summer in vegas is a miserable time, and my sisters and i braved that heat by looking at the bellagio water fountain in awe.  that water show is still the favorite part of my trip every time i go to vegas.  of course, this all happened before \"ocean's eleven\" featured that famous last scene.  i don't think we looked as cool as brad and george though...  i swore to myself that i'd never be back to this city after our incident at a club.  we got kicked out for having too much fun!!!  it was for a bachelorette party, and i think paris hilton was slightly jealous because we drew more crowd than her performance on that night.  we continued to party on in our suite and i discovered that night that jacuzzi could make even the most prude girl hot and steamy!!!  i am no longer young nor have enough energy to party all night, but vegas proved to be a great place to have some of the finest dining experiences one can enjoy.  this time, our sole purpose of the trip was to eat at delmonico steakhouse, and what a fantastic night we had!!!  some of us had been here before, so the night started with the chef's complimentary appetizer which was a capane of smoke salmon on puff pastry.  a bottle of red wine was chosen from their extensive wine list along with fried calamari and barbecue shrimp as appetizers.  i can't make a comment on the wine, but the calamari had overwhelming amount of olives for my taste.  i did love the shrimp as they were cooked perfectly in that tangy sweet bbq sauce.  some of us were disappointed that the restaurant no longer offered pork chop, but the special of the night was pork tenderloin with braised bacon, and they happily opted for it.  a couple of us ordered a bone in filet, the bf ordered a bone in ribeye and i got a filet mignon.  my butterflied medium steak was perfectly charred outside with some pink inside and it was very tender and juicy.  i tasted the pork dish and i loved every part of it.  i never knew that a chunk of bacon could be so buttery and sweet, and the cane syrup they used to braise was just perfect for that white fatty meat.  the highlight of the night was the bone in ribeye.  that thing was huge with so much flavor!!!  i rarely eat any pink meat, but the bf's medium rare steak was so delicious i didn't care for the color of it.  seriously, if you ever get a chance to go to delmonico, get their bone in ribeye.  you'll thank me forever for the best steak ever!!!  we also ordered sauteed garlic mushroom and roasted fingerling potatoes.  it was a mushroom heaven with all different kinds of them (shiitake, button, oyster, portebello, etc) cooked in chopped garlic and the aroma itself could make someone's mouth watery.  those purple, yellow and red potatoes side dish was recommended by our maitre d' and it didn't disappoint us.  maybe it could be too heavy for a light eater with all that meat, but for a person like me (a meat & potato girl), i couldn't ask for a better meal.  i must say this steakhouse is a place to impress someone.  it's a huge restaurant, but since it was sectioned into 3 different rooms, it rather felt intimate and quaint.  small tables were cornered so you could be private and although the restaurant was busy, i never felt rushed.  the waiters were not those friendly joker types, but the service we received was more than adequate and appropriate.    delmonico renewed my faith in vegas.  i was impressed...i was happy...i was glad to be back to vegas where i have the good, the bad and the ugly memories of my \"peak\" time!  this dining experience (not just the food) tops as one of my favorite moments in vegas.",

    "text": "I seem to have really good luck with Emeril's restaurants. After my recent visit to Delmonico's, I'm beginning to think he can't go wrong. From the moment we walked in the door, it was just instantly different from all the other restaurants we visited. We were greeted warmly, seated immediately even though we were early, and had friendly, attentive service the entire time.   The atmosphere inside Delmonico's is not at all what I would have expected, but it is simple and lovely. The colors are warm, the lighting is excellent (especially at a steakhouse, I need to be able to see my food!), and the decor is plain and easy on the eyes (not a lot of decoration at all).  We started with some truffle potato chips and a tomato salad to share while we were getting settled. Vince curled up with the wine list with a big, giant grin on his face. Ah, so many choices to go with steak, but we can't really go wrong with Chambolle Musigny, so there you go, and we threw in a bottle of Sancerre to start.   I ended up getting Emeril's famous bone-in ribeye, Vince got the filet, and Phil and Alexandra got BBQ shrimp and mushroom medallions. We also got an assortment of sides, including spinach, asparagus, mushrooms, and garlic smashed potatoes. For someone who likes pure, unadulterated meat, my ribeye was about as perfect as you can get. Cooked to my desired rare plus bloodiness, with a simple crust of Emeril's Essence, a beautiful quality cut without any tendons or gristle, just beautiful meatiness. Vince's filet was similarly perfect, nice and thick and bloody, with a delicious cajun rub that enhanced the meat without overpowering it. I was impressed with Alexandra's medallions - they were pretty large for medallions; they looked like big 4 oz filets in their own right. I'd had the shrimp before at Emeril's seafood restaurant so that was nothing new but those were also good. The spinach actually tasted like spinach (rather than cream), and the asparagus was nice and al dente.   I finished up with some pecan pie, a generous Jamaica Blue Mountain espresso (I was impressed that the coffee list provided a wide variety of espressos from which to choose), and a cognac. Too bad it was only lunch! This meal was certainly the highlight of our trip (In addition to being the best, it was also the least expensive). Afterwards our server took us on a tour of the restaurant. Next time we are definitely going to try to reserve the chef's table. I already can't wait!",

The sauce with the shrimp was a rich deep color with lots of flavor. Not your traditional BBQ shrimp. The gumbo wasn't spicey, but had a nice flavor. We also got complimentary \"sweet\" rolls (maybe yeast?) with our shrimp and gumbo. They were SOOO good! Great experience!",

The Bone-in Ribeye is a lot of steak for the money, we'll marbled, and cooked to a perfect \"rare-medium-rare.\" It was so damn good, but I had to cut and give away slivers around the table. I could've easily split that plate with a salad and the fried oyster app (which was eerily reminiscent of Commanders Palace in N.O.)  I had a bite of the salmon with that sweet chili BBQ sauce which was buttery soft and very tasty. It was a nice contrast to the Fred Flintstone size steak. I also tried some of the grilled cheese dipped into the Tomato Bisque. Whoa, what a rush of flavors. The cream spinach was really good. More texture from the spinach than usual with the perfect balance of cream. Asparagus had just the right texture too. How will I eat dessert?  Banana Cream Pie, that's how. IT'S DIVINE! You must try it. Polly and Marie be damned. This tall towering pie can be shared 3 or 4 ways, but you must go vertical. Cut a slab, drag it through the caramel sauce, slather it with cream, and throw it on your plate. Don't leave here without a cross-section of all its layered goodness. Look how happy my friend Lauren P. from San Diego was when it came.  Coming back fo sho. Emeril, you kick ass. BAM!",

Here is what we ordered: Tuna and salmon tartar: omg so good. Combined with the crispy chips, I could order two of it for an entry next time.   Fresh oysters: tasted very fresh  BBQ Shrimp: got it despite yelp reviews say not to. Thought it was pretty good. Nice bbq sauce.   Lobster bisque: good but too salty. Tasted better with bread. There were big chunks of lobsters though.   Caesar salad: it was made table side. Nothing spectacular, and way too much dressing.   Bone in rib eye: Amazing  New York Strip: pretty good but wasn't as good as the rib eye.   Salmon: forgot the exact name but it was very good. It had like gumbo style things on the bottom which made it interesting.   Garlic mushroom side: good   Garlic mash potatoes: just goes so well with the rib eye.",

They definately impressed in all facets of the meal. From a person very hesitant to recommend places, I would not think twice to recommend Delmonico's. It was a weekday, but we were able to make reservations and we're seated within a few minutes of arrival. A great overall dining experience.",

There was a group at the table next to us and he seemed much more attentive to them.   Another waiter came over at the end of our dinner and we asked what spice was used in the waffle- he said he didn't know. I then asked where The Dorsey was in proximity to the restaurant, he said- again, I don't know........ he didn't even attempt to answer our questions. Great food, less than adequate service.",

We arrived and we're promptly seated (we had originally made a reservation at 10pm but got there at 9) I was appreciative that they were able to accommodate us!  We were greeted by our very nice waiter and were offered a mini croissant and some ice water as we decided on our meal.  I had a green salad and the butternut squash ravioli for dinner and my mom had Emeril's BBQ salmon, which she felt was a little undercooked but had a nice kick.  Overall, the experience was nice, if you are into steak I would say it's a nice place to check out.",

The wait staff is attentive without being overbearing. There's none of the pretense you get at, say Carnevino in the same hotel complex. There is a nice energy level but you can easily hear each other.  We brought a wine bottle from home and the wait staff was fine with it. They politely informed us of the corkage fee (a reasonable $30) without making us feel weird about having brought our own bottle the way some places do.  We started with a very tasty shrimp cocktail to share. Then I moved on to the Piedmontese boneless strip steak, which was delicious. Helen had the salmon, which was like butter. Potatoes au gratin made a nice side.  Everything was perfectly cooked, impeccable in quality, and served with refined flair.",

The steaks came out super fast and were unfortunately super rare. My wife decided to eat hers, but I sent mine back. My steak came back closer to medium rare than medium, and the flavor was gone. I waited at least ten minutes for the steak to come back, and it was a miss. On top of that, my filet's cut was poor. The sides were fine - mushrooms and twice baked potato.  I kind of felt that the kitchen and management really blew this for us. At a place with a price point like this, walking in just before closing shouldn't impact the food quality. I feel like the kitchen wanted the steak out ASAP so they could shut down for he night. On top of that, no manager came to say a word about the mistake, and nothing was done to compensate for it - no comped drink or dessert or even a \"sorry\" from the management. I think that this is inexcusable considering this is an Emeril restaurant and is quite pricey.  Not sure we will return, which is too bad because we are fond of the place from past visits.",

They keep the bottles for you off the table, so you never pour on your own and your drink is never empty.

Salads were just alright but main courses and dessert was great. Filet and bone in ribeye were what most of our 7 top ordered, all cooked and Creole seasoned to perfection.

At $14 for soups and $62 for a steak ( including $12 for peppercorn sauce).  You get it here.  A couple of issues. Delmonico's is branded as a premier Steakhouse priced accordingly.  Nothing about my meal and / or my service deserved a premier rating.  My steak was ok at best.  The Peppercorn sauce lacked any sort of consistency and flavor.  My Wife's turkey was good... but that was expected given day.  Service was attentive and not overbearing. They accommodated our kids ( mostly stuck to their Kindles all evening... thank you Amazon!)    but were slow to react to most simple requests ( again, could be thanksgiving though we were there early).

The servers themselves were great and always helpful but just seemed to be pretty absent most of the night.  The food itself was very good. The pre-dinner rolls were light, which I liked so you didn't get too full on bread before your actual meal came. I ordered the BBQ Salmon. A lot of other plates at our table were the rib-eyes. Everything was cooked perfectly, and my only complaint might be that the salmon was really heavy on BBQ sauce. Portions were large enough to be worth the price, but it really depended on the items ordered.  Overall 5 for food, 3 for service.",

They start you off with these fresh out of the oven dinner rolls that you can never get enough of, but watch out that you don't fill up on it.  The steaks are worth skipping some bread for.  I always go with the aged prime ribeye on the bone.   It never disappoints and this time since there is a ban of foie gras in Cali I opted to try it for the first time as a topper.  Please don't mock me for never trying the foie, well I can you can, but as a Yelper/foodie I had to try it for my street cred.  I thought it was okay, I just I'm not as much as a foodie as everybody else.  It was just some extra fat for my steak.  I would recommend the banana cream pie for dessert, it was amazing!  Bravo!  The Bad:  Only thing I would say it that you will be having a slow dinner.  I think we were there for a few hours.  The Ben:  Get the ribeye, pie and prepare for they long night of eating.",

I was not disappointed at all....the halibut was perfect.  Veggie on the table were severed family style which made it easy to share and try everything: mushrooms, broccoli, asparagus, mashed potatoes, twice baked potato, and regular baked potato.  The mushrooms were my personal favorite but everything was great. Other proteins  on our table: pork chop, rack of lamb, ribeye, NY strip, and filet mignon, while I didn't try them everyone in our group loved their dish, nothing but happy faces in our party. The service was stellar and the pop overs were mouth-wateringly delicious.  Also had the bbq shrimp appetizer and truffle potato chips both were great not a crumb left on the plate. Cocktail wise the Dorian Gray was sweet with a bit of punch at the end, I loved it. Overall I would love to return to Delmonico and perhaps leave room for dessert next time!",

Tender, seasoned and delicious.  Perfectly cooked medium rare.  We added the foie gras accompaniment ($20), which made it INCREDIBLE.  Killer combo and highly recommended!  #Corn Au Gratin ~ piping hot, with crunchy bread crumbs on top.  Not too heavy, not too light.  A definite winner.  I could not stop eating it.  #Creamed Spinach ~ good.  Also not too heavy.  But, not mind blowing.    #Wild Mushroom Pappardelle Pasta with Truffle ~ a decadent appetizer and quite delicious.  ($20)  This was a dinner special, so I don't know if they regularly have it.  Tasty, but quite a small proportion.  #Lobster Salad with Champagne Vinaigrette ~ tasty, with a nice chunk of lobster on the side of leafy greens, thinly sliced red onions and halved cherry tomatoes.  ($20) But, nothing to write home about.    #Bread ~ Biscuit shaped croissants, with butter.  Ok.  Would have been better served warm.    Service was attentive.  Our champagne glasses were topped off regularly.  Water glasses refilled constantly.  Reservations were a piece of cake through OpenTable.  Seated within 5 minutes of arrival.  Total bill - $200+ for 2 people.  Reasonably priced for fine dining.    BOTTOM LINE:  Highly recommend and would dine again!  Next time, I will leave room for dessert.  Creme Brulee and Bread Pudding was on the menu and I heart both!",

Wife had the pork chop and it was out of this world. Service was also good and the place was affordable as far as Vegas steakhouses go. However, the overall experience was 3 star. The place had no energy on a Friday night. Light crowd, we were put in a dark corner right next to a bunch of other people when the restaurant was half empty. Ceaser salad for 2 was $34, it was good but portion size was small. Baked potato was dry. Again, steak was incredible, rest of the experience was 3 stars. I prefer Stack steakhouse across the street at Mirage.",

    "text": "I gave myself a few days before I wrote this review, to see if all the money I dropped on this dinner would be worth it. I've never spent so much on a dinner before, and so even with the glowing Yelp reviews, I went into this a little uneasy.  My boyfriend had paid for most of our Vegas trip, so I wanted to treat him to something special. This most definitely was.  We made reservations that morning (Thursday, so probably a slow night) for 7 pm. We arrived and were quickly seated. The decor was understated, with muted beige walls and plush brown leather chairs.  The service was impeccable. We had three waiters taking care of us! Water glasses never got more than half empty, and they were always ready to please. I asked where the women's room was, and the waiter led me there instead of just giving me directions. I really appreciated that, since the bathrooms were hidden away.  Lovely bathrooms though, but I expected that. A nice touch for the ladies was a basket of feminine supplies provided in case of emergency,  But now, to the main attraction: the food. Oh dear God, the food. We started with the truffle parmesan potato chips. So simple, but sooooo good.  I got a rare filet mignon and the boyfriend got the bone-in rib eye medium rare. We got just one side, the cheddar bacon grits. They were good, but could have used more bacon. Then again, I think everything could use more bacon.  The meat was... quite literally the best I ever had. I love my steaks bloody, but my plate was clean until I cut into the steak. Chalk that up to a good sear and the excellent crust from the rub they use. It was kinda Cajun-y, but didn't overpower the glorious meat. It was allowed to prove itself as is and it was worth every penny.  We surprisingly still had room, so we went for dessert. I went for my old standby, the creme brulee. The boyfriend was intrigued by the root beer float with sarsaparilla sorbet.   Can't screw up creme brulee, so no complaints. The sugar crust was thicker than expected, but the sweetness was offset by the chocolate shortbread cookies that came with it. Chocolatey, but not sweet. I could snack on them all day.  But the root beer float was a work of art. Came to the table in one of those tall sundae glasses, with the sarsaparilla sorbet on the bottom and vanilla ice cream on top. Waiter poured the bottle of root beer and left the rest for him.  My boyfriend is a root beer connoisseur. He used to make his own, so he knows his root beer. And he is still going crazy over that float. I think that speaks for itself.  So while at first I might have been apprehensive, I'm really glad we came here. It's out of our budget to do again anytime soon, but I definitely won't forget it.",

    "text": "This has definitely been the best Steak in Las Vegas that I have had yet.   Not only were my date and I able to get a table last minute w/o a reservation - but our wait staff was very knowledgeable and friendly. I was given two wines to try based on my meal choice, and stuck with an Aussie Syrah that was to die for.   We were given no attitude when we told the server that we wanted to share the bone in ribeye($52) which was fab given our desire to try other menu items w/o emptying our pockets completely.   Started off with the Blue Cheese Apple Salad ($16) which had these grapes (that I originally thought were olives until I bit into them) I can only describe as being totally delicious.   Then we picked the garlic sauteed mushrooms and asparagus for sides (all sides $9) The shrooms were wonderful, lots of flavor and definitely went well with the meat. The asparagus was cooked right, but I would say it lacked flavor, we had to sprinkle salt over it, and that is a downer for me at a nice restaurant.   Our Bone in Rib Eye steak, which was split for us by the kitchen no questions asked, ... except for one \"Who get's the bone?\" \"I Get the Bone!\" I replied!   Ordered along with a side of raw horse radish and their signature steak sauce ... The Rib Eye was cooked to perfection. I order my steak Med Rare (even though I like it bloody) because I've found in the past nicer steakhouses tend to cook on the rare side. True to form, it was cooked amazingly well. Very pink, and extremely tender. Every bite seemed to remind me of a fillet which is unusual for that cut of meat, it just melted in your mouth then, after my date made sure I wouldn't offend anyone by asking if they minded me chewing on the bone like a dog with table scraps ;) - I did just that   I'd also like to mention that if you have a choice, I would ask for Todd to be your server, he was a delight to talk to, and payed us a lot of attention - which is more than I can say for the staff at Stack inside the Mirage :(   Our entire bill was only $110 and we were both full and satisfied. I would go back to Delmonico's again in a heartbeat.",

Went to Delmonico on a suggestion from a trusted friend, and damn, glad I did.  He may be annoyingly over the top on TV, but Emeril and company know what they're doing.  Right from the beginning wait to be seated, until the ending dessert and coffee, we had a great time with great food.  In a \"that is so Vegas\" twist, our waiter looked like Wayne Newton.  They were great on recommending drinks and pick of entrees, and answered all questions off the menu.  Service was even to such a level that they helped my lady with her seat, which is good, since the chairs are heavy.   As to the food. . . *glarg* *drool*  Sorry, I get moisture in my mouth thinking about it.  Shrimp the size of my thumb after I hit it with a hammer covered in a fantastic spicy cream sauce, steak that you could cut with a spoon, a portion of the most tender venison I've ever had, that was just as good when cold the next day (because I couldn't eat all of it), a martini that made it harder to walk out of there than the amount of food I ate, incredible desserts, and well, an espresso menu that involved such quality coffee I had no idea coffee that good existed.  I don't eat at high caliber steakhouses on a weekly basis or anything, but I've been to a few, and it's not like DC has a shortage of them given the wealth there.  Vegas is the same sort of way -- artificial city with lots of money -- and damn if Delmonico didn't top anything I've had so far when it comes to high caliber steak places.    And in case you're wondering -- she said yes.  I'm sure that was in part due to this dinner. ;)  ~EEE~",

You would imagine a fine dining establishment like Delmonico would give you top notch service when you're there, it was average at best.  I ordered a glass of wine, the bone in rib eye, the bone in new york, cream of corn, and a twice baked potato. The server kept insisting we add an appetizer and a half bottle of wine to our order. I know its their job to encourage customers to order more, but I had a sense the server felt like I wasn't spending enough to justify exceptional service.  This may be a pet-peeve of mine, but I hate it when the server doesn't bring you the bill nor does he bring you back the bill after you paid. The runner did this. The runner also was the one who asked if I would like dessert. I know its a busy restaurant, but the server could have brought back the bill and asked if I enjoyed everything (what if something was wrong?). Again this is a pet-peeve of mine.  Ratings for the food:  Bone in Rib Eye: 5/5 stars Bone in New York: 4/5 stars Cream of Corn: 5 stars Twice Baked Potato: 4/5 stars Regular Idaho Potato (from a previous stay): 3/5 stars Calamari (from a previous stay): 3/5 stars Dinner Rolls: 5/5 stars",

    "text": "Ambiance is zilch -- honestly I don't know how the decor could be more plain and completely un-styled.  Sommelier unfamiliar with the wine we picked.  Steak was cooked correctly, but thin (for a premium steakhouse) and presentation was poor -- cooled and congealed greasy sauce/butter.  I am skeptical of the USDA Prime rating for this steak -- it was nowhere near as high quality as other Prime steaks I've had.  Creamed spinach was oddly tough and chewy -- I don't even know how that is possible but it was.  On the plus side, the lighting is effective and the whisky and bourbon selection is great.  Service felt very scripted and impersonal.  I can't believe the reputation this place has.  I guess it is Vegas, and when people pay top dollar they put on their rose tinted glasses and fail to see that the emperor has no clothes.  If it was not for the price and reputation, i would say it was a decent meal.  But it was so not even in the same ballpark as meals I've had for the same price at El Gaucho, the Metropolitan Grill, Wolfgang's in Manhattan, and steaks in Brazil and Argentina.",

    "text": "This was the best steak dinner I have had in Vegas hands down.  The portions are HUGE so you will leave very full.  The caprese salad was really good and the steak was amazing.  I was not so impressed with their dessert menu.  I would definitely come back.  My only complaint was that a meal takes a while at this place so be prepared for a leisurely dinner here.",

    "text": "Had the most amazing dinner here with my wife the other night.  Very fancy restaurant, but gives off a warm ambiance.  We were looking for a great meal to spend $150-200 on, and we hit it out of the park with this place located in the Venetian shoppes.    Quick rundown:  Food was absolutely amazing.  My wife had the BBQ Salmon and she is still talking about it days later.  I had the rib-eye and I have to say that it was on par with any other steak I have had, including my fav Maestro's.    Service was what you would expect from an establishment like this, impeccable.  Constant checking in and recommendations that were absolutely perfect!  Was impressed when I asked for a wine recommendation with my steak I was not told the most expensive bottle they had, rather the one that went best with the meal.  Overall if you are in Vegas and looking for a classy and elegant dinner that will cost you, give this place a try.  I don't believe you will be disappointed.",
