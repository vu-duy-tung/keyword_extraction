Not sure what I was expecting from a steak salad butttttt I still expected better.  A few in our group had the seafood including my husband and he said it was ok as well.  The atmosphere is ok and the waitstaff was ok. I guess if your looking for some bar type seafood this place is good for that. I cannot say that I will be rushing back anytime soon but I also cannot say that there was really anything wrong with it. I guess I just expected more out of my steak salad than I got.",

    "text": "Tough to review this place  The service has always been terrible. The food quality always amazing.  Dark and dingy is it a seafood place , a dive bar , late night hang out, or gaming spot.  The staff is always running around looking like it's their first day on the job. I have been seated and waited twenty minutes before acknowledged. And that was because i passed out from hunger  The waiter seemed stressed and didn't want our table or order. The manager seemed perplexed by it all and the ambiance was loud and fun. It's unfortunate that it always seemed like amateur hour because the food is so darn good  Don't think I have ever had a bad meal. The peel and eat shrimp is to die for.   The happy hour seemed to change from my visits. One time I was allowed to order food Togo one time I wasn't on happy hour. The drinks are comped if your playing the machines which is nice and the bar staff had always been friendly.   For the area and late night food it is some of the best around. If you can have a few beers ( if you can get them ) and not stress about service you will enjoy yourseld",

We were greeted as soon as we sat down, asked by numerous bartenders if we needed anything, and very friendly. We happen to go on $1 oyster night which was a plus. The oysters were very nice sized but, a bit gritty. I had the gumbo which was no compare to Oyster Bar quality but, still good. I'd definitely return.",

    "text": "So this was the WORST  service I've ever had here. I live around the corner and this is my favorite place to go to. But I'm seriously considering goin to timbers next time.  I usually order food and hang out with friends. Tonight we all  ordered appetizers and entrees, had a few drinks. Built up a pretty big bill. But still we were having a good time. Our server was nice and she was cute. Had a nice smile. She could have come around to check on us a bit more often but what ever that's ok with us. She got what ever we needed fast so that's all that counts.  She ended up leaving before we were done and told us to go to the bar for anything we needed. Ok sounds easy. NOT! The bartender wes a freaking asshole. We're trying to get our checks (my BF is trying to get them) and the bartender is giving him attitude about what's on what ticket. He doesn't know he was at the bar gambling most of the time. So I walk over and began to try and fix things. My BF turns around and walks away and the bartender throws his arms up and makes a face. (Like woah wtf) so I'm trying to work with the guy he prints up the ticket and throws it to the side then he walks of mumbling something and goes serves other tables. HELLO! I'm trying to get out and pay my bill. (Witch for the table was around $120) after he was done gave us a list of tickets we paid before he could even make drinks for other people.   Needless to say leaving took way longer then it should. Service was shit at the end. Food was ok. Overall I haven't left a place this upset in a long time. Ugh. Good luck.",

I sat for over 5 minutes at the bar and not once did the brunette bartender acknowledge me in anyway. She got a couple of drinks, went into the kitchen, and then played with her phone cord on a strip outlet by the register. Never once looked up and said she'd be right with me or anything. This reminded me that this has happened to me before there. You basically have to be a regular to get anything resembling adequate service at Schucks.   What is the dysfunction at this bar that they can't get employees to practice just adequate customer service?",

    "text": "I was watching a re-run of Bizzare Foods recenlty and saw Andrew Zimmern diggnig up clams in Rhode Island.  Suddenly I found myself with a strong craving for fried clam strips.  I used to share a basket with my mom at our favorite sea food place when I was a kid.  I had to have them again.  It had been too long.  After much searching a failed attempt at a restaurant that no longer exists, I found myself at Shucks Tavern.    It was about 9:30 AM when I was in the area and I knew Shucks to be open 24/7.  So in I walked and was immediately handed a menu for breakafast items.  I gave the guy a funny look and asked if they were serving only breakfast or if I could order from the regular menu.  He said I could order anything and must have been confused by my request.  I mean who wouldn't be.  I'm sure most people don't tend to order fried clams at 9:30 in the morning.  But I've never been one for breakfast foods and I had a craving.  So I ordered my fried clams, a side salad with Italian dressing and an ice tea.    What seemed like many minutes went by and were fewer than it seemed.  Soon I had my salad and a nice plate of fried clams.  They were impressive too.  Dark golden brown.  Big and meaty.  There was a large cup of cocktail sauce and a couple of lemon wedges on the side.  The salad was perfect for a side.  Mixed greens, tomato, onion.  The perfect amount of dressing.  The vinegar woke up my taste buds and got me ready for the good stuff, the clams.  And they were good.  Tender but still chewy to let me know they were the real deal.  None of this chopped formed garbage.  Perfectly fried and crispy.  The cocktail sauce was amazing.  There was enough horse radish to make me sweat.  A little extra lemon juice mixed in and it was perfect.  I ate down those crispy little bi-valves and felt this sense of euphoria wash over me.  My craving had been satisfied and I was ready to begin the rest of my day.  Everybody else can keep their Wheaties.  For me, fried clams first thing in the morning is the True breakfast of champions.",

I've been here before and ordered a spinach dip that was so cold in the middle I had to return it so they could heat it up, it wasn't any better warm though. This place has just been such a huge disappointment. It's walking distance from my house but I would rather drive to a bar that has better food and service. Sorry not sorry.",

I ordered the Fish Fry .. and man was i in for a treat. I had a HUGE plate of fried haddock which was extremely flavorful and tender\\moist.  I enjoyed it completely.

They offered a decent selection of 10-12 meals with extra sides at the bottom of the menu for a couple dollars more. I had your typical breakfast meal (2 eggs, 3 slices of bacon, hash browns, and an english muffin)...  everything was cooked perfectly and tasted wonderful! Don't expect Claim Jumper portions but you will get a filling meal for only $3.95! The waitress was fantastic and had a great personality which is very rare these days! We will be coming back soon to try out the dinner menu and will definitely be recommending this place to people in the NW.",

Since I am from the NW (part of the country) and near the ocean, I thought the portions were a bit small for the prices. Creative menu and drinks, some of them I have never heard of and enjoyed tremendously. We had the clam bake for two that was just enough for one of us (we love seafood and grew up with it) and I had a pasta seafood dish. Tasty. Atmosphere was nice although the occasional drunk from across the bar made conversation a bit rough at times. Seat yourself, you choose your booths! Would go back anytime but probably when I got paid again since we left after spending $130 for two.",

    "text": "Recently moved to NW Las Vegas and have been checking out the neighborhood restaurants and taverns. Shucks quickly became a favorite after we had 2 dinners, a lunch, and several breakfasts. Joenna is our restaurant favorite server and ???our favorite bartender. (So sorry we don't know...gorgeous with long dark hair in ponytail..........worked until 3:30 or 4 pm today ( NCAA Gonzaga v S. Carolina [april 1].   Went to Shucks to see game and enjoy the atmosphere. So disappointing......the food and the later bar service. Food: ordered basic cheese nachos. Had to ask for guacamole and sour cream that came with them. $7.95 Nachos were soggy and stale. We just thought that was a lesson to us not to order appetizers. Later, ordered the $25.95 \"build your own order\". Being shrimp lovers, We ordered cocktail shrimp, popcorn shrimp, coconut shrimp and the peel and eat shrimp. (We had previously ordered the coconut shrimp and popcorn shrimp as entrees during another visit.)  Wow, how disappointing. 10 small popcorn shrimp supposedly equaled 1/2 pound. The cocktail shrimp were the same as the peel and eat.....mushy and miserable. We sent them back, requesting more coconut or popcorn shrimp. Frankly, I believe the cook peeled 4 of the shrimp we sent back and deep fried them...no resemblance to the first portion of coconut shrimp. Truly angered me.   Additionally, we sat at the bar with empty glasses waiting for someone (of the 3 bar staff) to notice. We are well dressed, well behaved adults, and the bar was not very busy.   We left. Will we go back? Can't tell you...we're home watching Oregon win, in comfort.",

    "text": "The front of this restaurant faces a parking lot, with the back facing the road, so you have to be paying attention to find it. Once inside, it reads like a typical sports bar - smokey, lots of TVs, with half of the interior taken up by a dining area with some booths and low tables. The menu is EXTENSIVE. Usually not a great sign, but the food we got was acceptable. I had the Shuck's salad, which has a little piece of tuna, two shrimp, and a tiny scoop of crabmeat on a romaine salad with a vinaigrette dressing. It also came with a piece of cheesy texas toast on the salad which wasn't my thing. We also ordered the crab cakes, which in my opinion were small for the price. They tasted fine though, and the two came with a small salad of slaw in between them on the serving plate. No one got sick, extra point for that. My soda didn't ever get refilled though, so that was a minus.   They have specials which are listed as you walk in, mostly things like X for half price on Tuesdays kind of thing. They also have rotating daily specials on a board inside the door. Overall, I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here, but if I am in the area in the future and have deemed all other options less desirable, I might come back to try the crab legs since that seemed to be the most raved about menu item. Maybe I'm just not that used to eating in a bar where people are smoking and my server doesn't refill my drink, but given that, the food was just fine.",

I think I've posted a years worth of pictures before writing this review but whenever I'm in the north west area of Las Vegas I know for sure Shucks is always a good option for me to fall back on.  Let me wrap this up by saying the Salmon entree is excellent, the pork chop appetizer is always good, and the black cod/catfish dishes are gravy too.    Do not hesitate ever to walk in!",

We didn't get ID'd from a blond server. I would understand if we looked over 30 but I'm 21 and Chris is 24. The server with the red hair is amazing! She is great at recommending food, drinks, and just fun to talk to! I wasn't too fond of Doug at first, but he's really great to me now!   There is smoking in this bar so don't come in here and complain about that. Most bars have smoking anyway. It's opened 24 hours too which is a huge plus being down the street! It's right across the street from Smiths on N. Durango and Elkhorn. I think it's cool that they have an ATM inside as well!   Now for food. The bacon wrapped shrimp ($8.95) is to die for. The bacon is crispy and has this amazing smokey taste to it. The shrimp in this dish are huge as well! The Wild West burger ($10.95) is really good. Huge sized burger and extremely juicy. It comes with a side of fries! Their garlic fries are my favorite. It is extremely garlicey so just a heads up. If you don't like garlic, obviously it isn't meant for you. Their mashed potatoes are really good too but you need to add a lot of salt to it. Onion rings are the thicker cut ones (my favorite style) and it's extremely crispy. Their shrimp tacos were a little disappointing to be honest. If you're going to get tacos, get their chicken ones. Those ones were amazing! I love the fish n chips here! ($11.95) Again their portioning sizes for everything are huge. I just thought it was a little heavy on the stomach. My favorite food wise is their pasta dishes. The portions are huge! The scampi ($13.95) was amazing. It has so much flavor in it. Perfectly cooked noodles as well. The seafood fra diavolo plate (18.95) is all over the place, but in a good way. There's so much going into this dish. You get your shrimp, clams, scallops, and mussels in a huge plate. The sauce is a little spicy too, it adds such an amazing flavor. The scallops in that were my favorite! Their shrimp Alfredo (14.95) is my favorite dish here, but keep in mind that I haven't separately gotten oysters or clams yet. They actually put a good amount of shrimp in it, it's so cheesy and delicious. It's not as thick as most places make it but it's still a heavy dish. It comes with a piece of toast on it as well. Their french toast on their breakfast menu is amazing! You get that with ham, bacon, and sausage for just $5! It's well worth it and filling as well. I love their chicken fried steak and eggs. $6.95 for that. The steak is a little small but the gravy is perfectly seasoned. Honestly the prices are worth it for everything I've tried here.  All in all I love it here. The service is great no matter who it is, the food is definitely worth the prices! Has to be one of my favorite places to go.",

What got me the most was the smoking in the bar...haven't seen that in a restaurant area in years. It wasn't too bad but noticeable.  The beer and mixed drinks were tasty. The beer was cheap at 2$ for a 16 oz special. We ordered tuna tartare to start and wanted 10 more...it was that good. Very fresh and big chunks of raw tuna with avocado and balsamic was amazing.   We had 1 1/2 lbs of mixed crab legs which were flavorful and meaty. We had a side of onion rings and they were just ok.   Overall I can see us heading back for more. On a side note it was very chilly inside. Take a jacket!",

It takes forever for the bartender/waitress to come over or even address you.Then once they finally do, they take your order, give you one drink and you basically have to hunt them down where you're ready to order a second drink, so plan to finish your food before someone even comes over to offer you another drink. It's unfortunate that the service is so poor because otherwise I would have given them 5 stars. Obviously if I come in to a restaurant/bar I'm looking to eat and drink, not just stare at the tv's empty handed. I will say the one time I came in and sat on the restaurant side, the waiter was super attentive and the experience was pleasant but that bar side ruins it for me.",

    "text": "I was told this place had $1 oysters at midnight.  Since I'm allergic to shellfish, I don't really care, I came here for the company and not for the food.  For people like me, there are non-shellfish options such as fish, chicken wings, fries, burgers and alcohol!  We sat at the bar.  They have black jack/ keno machines, etc.  The bar tender was cool.  I got a Malibu Bay Breeze per Honny's recommendation as I perused through the menu. The waffle fries comes with ketchup and ranch dipping sauce...they were good.  It must have been the alcohol or I simply had a death wish because I ordered Rockefeller oysters when I didn't have Benadryl.  I remember liking them when I was little before I developed my allergies.  It seemed like a good idea at that moment until I ate 3 oysters and some of my friend's Cajun shrimps - and my arm, my face and my back started to itch and my stomach started to hurt...the only thing I was waiting on was the anaphylactic reaction.  Centennial Hills Hospital is only a few blocks away so I wasn't worried.  Good oysters though...spinach, cheese, oyster with a bit of hot sauce...mmmm...  In New England, you can get a dozen oysters for $12-13 at a very good restaurant.  Shucks' $1 oyster at midnight = $12 for a dozen from their Graveyard Menu...sounds like a good deal to me.  They're open 24/7 too and also on their Graveyard Menu: burger with fries for  $4, wings and fries for $4-8, chicken fingers and fries for $5-10, shrimps for $5 and clam strips for $4.  Late-night cheap eats!",

    "text": "I've read a lot of the other reviews and will consider trying this place again one day based on those. They get two stars from me because they are open and serve food 24/7. I've worked restaurants all over this country and know 24/7 is a struggle itself. I personally didn't have a good experience at all. I walked in, all be it during their \"down time\" I'm sure. I was one of 5 people in the place. Two team members eating at a corner table(everyone has to eat and I'm in no way put off by this.) The dishwasher was sitting watching tv, again breaks happen and that's not bothersome to me. My issue is that there was one lady at the bar besides myself. She had maybe a sip of beer left for the 15 min I was there(would be my last ever here if I was her). I came in to grab a bite to eat and an application since I was new to the area then. Sadly I was never even offered a drink, much less would I EVER work here now. Maybe next time the bartender that I literally stared at the whole time I was there will realize she is in the customer service industry. Randomly tapping on her register but, really texting and on her phone the whole time is very obvious and frustrating. Especially to someone in the industry. I'll have to go in when they are slammed on a Friday night and see if the staff is ready and on point for service then or if they just have a great location and are only getting business because, this is Vegas and they are one of two bars in the immediate area. Which the other bar a couple doors down always seems to be busy no matter the hour and they have great food, drinks and service. Hopefully next time I will actually get served here and can rate the food, drinks and service instead of lack there of. I think I was extremely fair not just giving 0 stars. Not possible but, that's probably what this particular visit should have received.",

OK so we went here late Saturday night around 1am! Walking in the bar came across as a Pretty friendly bar. It seemed as though everyone knew everyone. The bar staff was friendly, nice and attentive! He took our drink order and dropped off the late night menu... the menu everyone had been ranting and raving about, the menu That brought us to this bar only to find out.. the menu changed!! Yes changed! NO burger and fries deal, no calamari special the only the thing that was the same was the $1 oysters! When we asked the bartender what's up w the the menu he Told us it had changed.. So I ordered the Rockefeller oysters, fried oysters and a couple raw ones as well and they were delicious.  The cook brought them out which nice. Overall the place was nice and the food was good but I wouldn't go out of my way to drive that far for it..",

The service is always top notch and the food is consistently fresh. My kids love the popcorn shrimp kids meals, and having to help them finish a few times i can attest to the fact that they are quite tasty. I can't bring myself to ever order anything besides the Clambake. It includes 1lb of snow crab legs, 1/2 lb of dungeness crab legs, 1lb clams, corn, potatoes and sausage. I have not yet been successful in actually finishing it but it never stops me from trying. My 10 year old shares it with me on most occasions. As a matter of fact, this was her restaurant of choice to celebrate her most recent birthday. We had 11 guests in all and the service was seamless. I called in advance and they set aside an area for our large party. My Dad raved about the fish fry platter, so I might have to try that at some point. I'm also curious about the breakfast specials!",

    "text": "It was a Sunday afternoon with hubby and the in laws. We all were super hungry and felt like seafood. After searching for seafood restaurants on Yelp, I came across Shucks Tavern & Oyster Bar. I printed out a coupon ($10 off of a bill $50 or more) and we hit the road.   At first, we were all very skeptical and the restaurant's building wouldn't reveal anything about what was expecting us inside. Finally we got over our fears and entered the restaurant. The atmosphere was very friendly, even though a little smoky, since the bar wasn't separated from the dinning area.   For the first hour we were the only customers in the entire restaurant, which didn't bother us at all. Our waiter was very friendly and helpful. We asked him about his favorite on the menu and he suggested the Clam Bakes for $26.95, which feeds up to 2 people and includes the following:          Manila Clams (1 lb)     Snow Crab (1 lb)     Dungeness Crab (1/2 lb)     Andouille Sausage     Red Potatoes     Corn  We ordered 2 of it and WOW, it looked and tasted amazing. The clams were very fresh and tasteful, and so were the snow crabs and the rest of the goodies in that shell looking bowl.   As we asked for the desert menu the waiter came back after about 10 minutes with a tray of different cakes and ice cream samples. We all thought that was very cute and the effort was what counted. We decided for a piece of chocolate cake and the fried cheesecake burritos. They both were very delicious.   I would definitely go back to Shucks. The food was fresh and tasty and price value relationship was great.",

We always start with oysters on the half shell which are always good and hot wings which are pretty good too.  For dinner I always get the crab cakes and side salad.   The crabcakes are yummy!  The side salad is top notch as well.  My hubby loves there alfredo and the kids like the food a lot too.  We have tried just about everything and it's all good.  Love the Clam Bake and Ahi tacos.  If you are a seafood lover, try this and you will not be disappointed!  Good sandwiches and steak and ribs....I just can't stop..they have it all and it's ALL GOOD!",

Wasn't expecting a large, regular late-night crowd, friendly crowd, and a varied, delicious sea-food menu available at all hours along with some very affordable breakfast deals!    It's now high on my list of late-night dining simply for the quality of food: for example - excellent garden omelet for four bucks that comes with the usual toast and poattoes.  But the tomatoes are simmered, the spinach is plentiful, the mushrooms are roasted before being tossed into the eggs.  It's worth the ten minute drive up the 95 for me.    The seafood is fresh and plentiful - they don't skimp on the portions!",

The crab legs are fresh, sweet and juicy. Love the fries and buffalo chicken wrap. However the service here is horrible, if you're unfortunate enough to get one of the girl waitresses. Takes 10 min to even be greeted luckily by then you have already decided what to eat. The food is out pretty fast because the cook usually brings it. Then it takes 30 min to be able to pay and leave.. Anyway if you have extra time to wait and don't mind dinner taking two hours they have good food.",

I thought it would still be full of people having drinks and hanging out, but I guess I was wrong.    We seated ourselves over by the bar area and it took a couple minutes for the server to come over and take our order.  We ordered a couple beers and the fish tacos, steak salad and a cup of seafood bisque.  The seafood bisque was super salty!  I wanted to take it home and mix it with canned soup to dilute it.    The fried fish tacos were actually pretty large and filling, and the flavor was good being not too dry and not too fishy.  The steak salad was good except for having too much bleu cheese.  Luckily we asked for the dressing on the side or else the flavor would have been too overwhelming.  The steak was seared and cooked almost like tartare which we liked.  But the rest of the salad was unremarkable in my opinion.  Next time I will come back to try oysters in some form, be it raw or rockefellar.  Maybe during a football game where they have discounts on food and drinks.",

Until now I had only visited the Flamingo/215 location and only for breakfast. When looking for place for the midday meal, the Mrs. and I opted for Shuck's. The only disappointment here is that I hadn't previously tried their lunch menu. They have a burger called the Mother Shucker that features a full pound of beef.  I opted for the smaller version or the \"Baby Mother.\" It came with fries (you can get garlic fries) and I added a side salad. The side salad was one the larger ones I've seen and featured red leaf lettuce, tomato and onion. Even the Baby Mother was huge and some kind of tasty. The waitress, Ashley, was very friendly and attentive, offering her advice on which fried fish the Mrs. should get. Good call on the Haddock Ashley. It was fresh and crisp, complete with garlic fries. I left stuffed like a Thanksgiving Turkey, with a smile on my face. Next time I'll attempt the Mother Shucker.",

With that said, for a 24 hour gaming bar with an oyster bar attached this is top notch.  The seafood was all super fresh.  The boy ordered clam strips and a crab bucket.  Both were delicious and fresh.  I had the fish tacos, heavy on the cabbage, but I like cabbage.  It was a celebratory dinner so we had carrot cake and it was flavorful and moist.  The service was great and the drink specials were good for a Friday night (half price martinis?  Yes please!).    We would definitely go back, especially since the boy often gets a craving for crab.",

Ordered: Mother Shucked with garlic fries 1 pound Dungeness crab  I have tried the Shuck burger and the mother shucker in the past and am quite familiar with the taste. Now, the flavor is just not the same. I've been giving them a go since I moved here in 2013, and there seems to be something different about the seasoning. 8 of 10 on the juicy rating, (well that's considering I get it medium rare). And for the Dungeness, tonight seemed a bit dry, maybe a bit over cooked. This has happened to us several times in the past 6 months. Not consistent,  so may just be different cooks. What I can say is, gotta try the garlic fries!   Definitely love the way the crew treats their customers, and how attentive they were. But I'll give it another 6 months try before updating again, just to see if it's just me or a change in cooks that's making my tongue confused.

We were all so famished I Yelped the area and found this place. seafood bar?! Uhh yaaaaas!   Upon arriving I really had a good feeling about this place. Maybe I ordered wrong but I also had a taste of everyone's else dish and I wasn't impressed.  I ordered the Seafood pan roast. Okay, so I may be bias but I am IN LOVE with oyster bar pan roast so my exceptions were probably a little too high. But the flavors just didn't not go well. The soup had a sweet creamy taste to it that I didn't recognize. The seafood that was in it was just not up to par. Just basically lots of clams and a few fish chunks. The rice, I don't even know what kind of rice that was. It defiantly was not the typical rice I'm used to.   My friend got the Gumbo. She never had gumbo before so she thought it was good. But the flavors just was really off. Even the waitress said she didn't really like the Gumbo. I agree with her.   My other friend got the Philly cheesesteak and the meat came out extra dry.   The beau got Steak and crabs. Now that was pretty good. I actually ate most of his crabs. I love crabs with extra lemon butter. That was amazing. The seasoning on the steak was different though, it had a Mexican feel to it kinda like carne asada. Wasn't bad just different.   The drinks were ... Alright. My friend had to send her margarita back because it tasted like water. The 2nd margarita wasn't any better but she got it blended and didn't want to complain anymore. The waitress was pretty nice though very helpful.   Reviews raved about the 1$ oysters... Unfortunately I don't eat oysters!",

While it didn't specifically state that we could bring kids in, there was a children's menu posted so we foolishly assumed children were allowed. When we arrived we were told that the kids had to leave. When we asked about the children's menu they told us they just hadn't gotten around to taking it off the website. Since we were a large group and everyone had already arrived a couple of us just left with the kids. Our evening was ruined. We would never have considered coming had the information on the website been up to date.",

I don't know if it is under new mgt or what, but gone completely downhill...I was there a month ago and usually order the steamed dungeness crab.  Whoever the new waiter is is completely clueless.  He totally screwed up my order, food was cold and tasteless.  The Mgr happened to come by & asked how everything was.  I let him know about the cluster mess  & he not only comped my meal, but gave me an extra portion to go,which I declined since I figured it would be just as bad!  I figured the waiter was having a bad day or just new, so let it go.  Well went back today since it is Friday & I like seafood during Lent & decided to give it another try.  Same guy was waiting tables & I was worried  & we sat down.  I don't know if he recognized me or what, but took 15 minutes to even come by to give me a menu.  We ordered and he even asked IF we wanted our appetizers first....HELLO? get a clue!  Well another 15 minutes go by & here comes some bus boy with the entrees! Needless to say, i was NOT happy, sent them back & told him I wanted our food in the correct order.  Another 15 minutes go by & out come they come.  My shrimp cocktail was luke warm & they were about the size of marbles.  The crab spinach dip my friend had was about the same temp and some kind of congealed mess with zero flavor & maybe they waived some crab over the top of it, but none was actually IN it!  I waived down the bus boy, sent them back & tried to get out inept severs attention once again.  You guess it, another 15 minutes go by & here come the bus boy with the main courses.  Again, luke warm  at best & the supposed \"melted butter\" was some kind of milky white watered down foam substance with zero flavor.  I told him just to bring the check...another 10 minutes and the waiter is back.  I told him I was here to give it another go & all the things wrong this time.  He said he would take care of our bill & I told him since we didn't eat it, that was a good thing.  I resisted telling the Mgr again about the repeat fiasco, but decided to write this review and NEVER go back.  I gamble there on a regular basis, so they have lost all of my patronage on both the bar & restaurant sides!",

I recently quit smoking so can appreciate that smokers enjoy smoking indoors, but I now find it rather unpleasant and have no idea how my friends put up with my stinkiness for so long (I must be really, really cool or something). Anyhow (I think I've just digressed...sorry!), the smoking is the only drawback I've found to this place.  Excellent quality food at a very reasonable price with good service, good atmosphere, and plenty of booze...what more could a cool girl like me ask for?! Looking forward to my next visit.",

    "text": "Yummy! This is where I go when I crave American-style seafood. They have affordable prices and big portions for the money. I love their oven bakes the best which are usually good for two people and are basically seafood (mussles, clams, lobster etc.), potatoes, corn baked together. I love the intermingling of flavors and the freshness and the size!  The deserts are also great as are the drinks. The 24 hour part is definitely a plus just in case I am craving some lobster at midnight (has happened before).   I like the decor. It's simple, but effective. This place is rarely crowded, and seeing how I hate crowds, it's a major plus for me. The wait staff is very good.  I miss this place since I moved to SW part of the valley. I'd like to try the other Shucks closer to me, but this one on N. Durango is highly recommended.",

We brought our 15 year old Grandson with us. We walked in, the sign said to seat yourself which we did. 1st a young girl walked out of the kitchen looked at us & giggled & went back in. a couple seconds later another young girl walked out of the kitchen looks at us giggles & goes back in. Now that we are a little weirded out another young lady walks to our table & tells us sorry we can't allow kids in here because they are having an issue with the health department because of smoking in their restaurant. Well it was nice of them  to embarrass us, would of been helpful if they either put a sign on the door or where you walk in near the sign that says seat your self. we could have done without the 2 immature girls giggling at us. Won't be going there or recommending this place anytime soon.",

Often times, I have joked about how I should do a competitive eating contest. I think I could take the women's oyster trophy home. But that's a whole other review.  I have always called T.P. up and asked to join me for oysters. He usually says yes, so I guess that makes us \"oyster buddies.\" Mind you, I usually make this decision VERY late at night (or early in the morning, depending on how you view it). I think it's cool that even though he's not as big of an oyster fan as I am, he still comes along.  The main reason for this (besides the LOVELY company, lol) is the HAPPY HOUR here. It starts late at night (I think maybe 11 or midnight, not 100% sure), but it's worth it!! All the raw oysters are $1!!! Many appetizers are between $3 and $6!! I can eat my fill of oysters, and not go broke! It's heaven for me.  The bartender who is usually working late is a pretty cool guy, and both he and the older cook in the back now remember us. One time, the cook even came out to deliver my oysters! I guess he had  to see me for himself. He was probably expecting some huge, obese chick, based on how many I always order LOL!  I have never been here during the day, but they have a full menu and serve lots of other things besides oysters. So far, everything I have had here has been pretty decent.",

When I first walked in I wasn't given a greeting, I'm assuming cause they probably thought I was some middle school kid that wandered in lost. The spiderman backpack I had probably didn't help. Oh well, my problem.   I pop a squat up at the bar, away from some obnoxious other patrons. That's right, I knew they were obnoxious the first 5 seconds I walked in. Kinda sat their awkwardly for four minutes. The other two bartenders ignored me. Thought I was waiting for mommy to finish her beer perhaps? Most likely. Could have asked though, you big jerks!   Finally a young lady came out and greeted me with a menu, I already had my ID ready (good job following the law!) and after a few minutes I ordered a beer and the crab bucket with a mix of the two types. One, cause I don't know the difference and decided if I'm going to fuck this up, I'm going to completely 100% fuck everything up!  They brought me out all the wrecking tools used to annihilate the crab legs, and I had no idea what to do. I played creeper and watched the guy a few seats down from me work his magic and then just tried to copy him. Could have I asked the waitress? Don't boddle me with your logic!  While it was good, I must say crab is not my thing. I'm one lazy ass bitch and sitting there for half an hour to get a handful of meat is not on my to-do list, but might be a good way to starve off the fat bastards we have on our planet.

Meaning the oyster was served on the flat (lid ) side of the oyster rather then the cup like side so there was no place for the oyster liquor (natural tasty broth) to go. Besides that I ordered a fried oyster po'boy and criss cut fries that were more then ample, served quickly and cooked to perfection.

The server was nice and kept checking on us, and filled my tea before it was even half empty. The place was nice and clean and smelled great! Our food didn't take too long to come out, and we tried lots of seafood! Between the scallops, clams, mussels, oysters, and calamari, we couldn't decide what was best! This is our new favorite place, and will definitely be back with our whole family!! Whoever the cook was last night is an excellent chef! Thank you Shucks!",

Too bad the place is so dirty.  It wasn't just our table either.  I looked at other tables and they all had filthy condiment bottles.  It's an easy fix by management.  I hope they consider stepping up their cleanliness.  Thanks  Brandon  (702) 787-5803 Bgat72@gmail  I appreciate the response from Schucks, and I will give it another shot.

    "text": "I've only been here once and hope to bump up my rating as I plan on coming back. Shucks is very appealing to me because its pretty close to my house, making it super convenient, AND they have a good mix of seafood as well as meat - very important factor for me because my sweetie hates seafood and I love it. Typically places that advertise seafood have either none or very few meat options. Shucks seems to have everything. Should be a match made in heaven, right? I thought so too but it did not go down that way. Fist, they had $3 margaritas on Tuesday - yes please! Margaritas were pretty good, deliciously potent. I decided to try their crab and spinach dip appetizer and went with jambalaya as an entree. The the dip had something sprinkled on top, which I assume was crab.. there were no other signs of crab, it was basically a spinach dip. The cajun jambalaya was supposed to have cod, crawfish, and andouille sausage - it had one piece of overcooked cod, probably 3 x1 inches with tons of sausage and some crawfish. The clod looked like was a side order. I was super confused why it came in one piece on the side and why that was all the cod that was in there... The biggest problem I had with the jambalaya is that it was SUPER salty. I am a salt loving gal but this thing was all salt. I couldn't really eat it.  My honey, however, enjoyed his wings and fries. He is a wing snob and is very particular about his wings. He only gets wings from two spots in Vegas. Well, he like the wings here! He got them medium. His french fries was delicious too, I can attest to that :) Though I did not care for my food, I plan to come back and try other things off the menu to find what I like. I really have high hopes for Shucks!",

    "text": "I've been coming to this location for a few years and have always been extremely happy with the food and the service. They have a nice bar area and then booths and tables. I usually always grab a booth because when I come here I'm so hungry I want to order a few things and it all doesn't fit comfortably on the bar.  We have had the exact same server for over a year now and he's great. Brings us our waters and beers quickly and keep them refilled. All the staff is pretty awesome and friendly and makes sure to never forget you.   My foodie date and I were starving so we started off with the crab and spinach dip. I personally do not like the pita chips it comes with so I had them switch it to tortilla chips instead. Always a favorite. Then we also ordered  the calamari this time. This was the first time ordering that appetizer here and I have to say that was some of the best calamari I have eaten anywhere in Vegas. It was so light and crispy that I savagely ate the entire plate by myself. If you come here definitely order that.   Now on to the entrees! I think I have tried almost everything on their menu now but the Steak and Crab is by far my favorite. It's a flat iron steak( seasoned perfected) which is delicious and 1/2 pound of crab. The steak is always so tender you can cut it with a fork and my crab was exceptional. Huge pieces of meat that didn't even need any lemon or butter because it tasted so good on its own. They were out of my favorite sauteed summer squash side so I got broccoli instead. My date had the new Clam Bake( I think that's what it's called..?) which was amazing! It had a generous amount of clams, andouille sausage, corn, snow crab, and these deliciously seasoned potatoes. Not only did I eat all my food but I ate part of my dates as well. Haha it was just extra good.   Even after all that food I had to have some desert. Their cheesecake and brownie is to die for but I decided on the fried cheesecake and let me tell you I wasn't disappointed!   2 appetizer, 2 entrees, dessert and soda/beers our totally bill came to $85 which I thought was very reasonably for seafood and steak. Great place and if you are a sports fan they always have the games playing as well.",

Fine....you changed your rules. But someone could have approached us when we first came in and not 10 minutes later. Smooth move people. We are definitely former customers - there are about 12 of us that used to frequent there.

So of course I ordered a burger tonight and I could tell right away something was off. My wife thought I was just complaining to complain so I asked if they changed their beef patty. Sure enough they DID in fact change their beef patties. Not as thick, juicy or as flavorful. Also hard to cook a burger medium rare with these new patties. The waiter said they were playing around with the menu and trying new things out. Don't think I will order a burger there again unless they go back to the old patties. Which is a shame bc I don't eat seafood. This was a great compromise restaurant for when she was craving seafood. I'm sure we will go back bc my wife needs her seafood from time to time, but depending on what else this head chef has changed (assuming it's a new head chef bc I've worked in the industry and a chef doesn't just change beef patties like that unless the owner is cutting his budget) will determine on if this will still be our compromises place or not. My wife would probably give it 4 stars for the seafood, but I'm writing this and their new burger patties are extremely disappointing. Great serves. GO BACK to the way it used to be when the burgers were juicy and flavorful",

What a disappointment at Shucks! The oysters were small and spindly and tasteless. One was so small I had trouble finding it in its half-shell.  I followed with the seafood bisque which was excellent but eat fast; it's best piping hot.  Realize that the two stars are for the quality of the oysters not the tavern. I first ordered a Heineken which was served in an ultra cold glass. It was most welcome. The bartender was very friendly and my waiter was attentive and friendly. The tavern itself was not smoky.  There are four TVs placed in such a way that only a few can see them well. There was only one broadcasting a live baseball game, the others, sports history  (I watched rerun of Super Bowl XVII, Balt (34) vs SF (31), still exciting). All-in-all, the tavern is a pleasant place (early Sunday evening) and well run. It was just the oysters that piqued me.  After going to Shucks I'm wondering whether a restaurant can advertise itself as an oyster bar year-round in a desert city. Oysters are mostly seasonal unless one lives close to the source (such as New Orleans or Houston) so we here in the middle of the desert may not be able to get quality oysters certain times of the year. Just thinkin' out loud here.",

Now, the price is the same, but you have to pay separately for the side of potatoes.  I would rather the price of the meal have increased than to be charged a la cart for each and every side item as if you were at a 5 star restaurant.  Then, to top it off, they charged me a \"To-Go\" fee.  That is absolutely absurd!",

And we ordered the Rockefeller oysters which were delicioso! And the mussels, reminded me of hot and juicy. We also ordered a couple drinks. And all of this was $50. I was very pleased with the pricing here. Well done. Definitely coming back here or bringing a friend !",

The bartender was good, he described the specials that he had and served me quickly even though he had a full bar. Great customer service even to the two girls at the end of the bar that dident know what they wanted to drink (If you have ever worked behind a bar you know the type lol). This is a great place to grab food or just a quick drink.",

    "text": "After reading such great reviews from you awesome yelpers, I knew I had to give this place a try. I looked at their menu and got so excited that I had to go that day. So I went to have a quick dinner with my bf last night around 9:30pm.  It wasn't too smokey or smelly inside, and it was a nice quiet day. We decided on the rockafeller oysters (6 per order) and they were delicious! Though the oysters were  bit small and it seemed there was way too much spinach for the amount of oyster, it somehow worked out! Great flavor.  And then we shared the ribs and shrimp combo. The ribs were great! Cooked perfectly and the sauce was yummy, it was a bit too saucy for me, but super yummy. And since I am a low-carber, I asked to sub the fries and slaw for a side salad. (Very fresh veggies). And we chose the garlic shrimp which was also delectable.  I must say, though, the server was a bit slow. He was the only one working the night shift and I guess he was tired, but there was only us and one other table...  I am going back Tuesday to try more yumminess. I will post pictures of the items I get! I'm excited to try their other stuff like the lobster fingers and clam bake and crab (which they ran out of when I was there)...  I highly recommend this place. I will probably make it a regular place to be.",

They weren't anything special and I wouldn't return.  I then had a combination platter to try several other dishes and was sorely disappointed.  The shrimp ceviche was bland and the only flavor that came out was the cilantro.  The calamari was overcooked so it was very chewy and the marinara it was served with was runny and odd tasting. The fried clam strips were over-battered and overcooked... the flavor itself wasn't bad but it was like chewing a tire.  The crab cakes didn't have any crab flavor, it was just an overpowering pepper flavor. All-in-all the service was fine and the people were nice so I have no complaints there.  Unfortunately most of the seafood is not fresh and I think this is the biggest reason why most of the food is bland and tough.  Granted its tougher to get fresh seafood in Vegas but the quality of the food is so low I won't be returning.",

The service was good, the beer was good, and the atmosphere was good. My fiance had clams and New England clam chowder and she loved them both. As for me, I had the Texas oysters. There are supposed to be prepared with tequila, lime, and Tabasco. Sounds pretty awesome, right? Well they had no flavor. I also had the crawfish appetizer. They were pretty good and came in quite a big portion for an appetizer. Since we both like seafood, we'll probably be back. I'll stick to crab legs for next time",

    "text": "So our first time coming here was a pretty bad experience. My husband, and brother in law, and myself were in the mood for some seafood, and decided to give this place a try after seeing some of the good reviews on yelp.  When we first walked in we werent really greeted, so we just found an open table (that wasn't covered in old dishes that hadn't been bussed yet). About 15 minutes later we had a servicer come take our drink orders. After about another 15 minutes we were able to order. My husband ordered a crab bucket, his brother a shrimp bucket, and I Ordered a shrimp poboy. We also got two appetizers the calamari and the clam strips.  The calamari was burnt to a crisp, like crack your jaw and slice up the inside of your mouth burnt crisp. And the clam strips were more like fat little clam chunks, I've never seen them cut up that way. And they were very tough. Unlike the calamari they were at least edible, unfortunately there were only like 4 clam strips on the plate. All together the appetizers were very disappointing.  By this time we've long been out of water. And couldn't seem to catch the attention of the 2 servers that were rushing around past our table. Finally when our food was brought to us (maybe other 15-20 minutes had passed) we asked the server who had brought the food for some refills, and tried to place an order for a drink. She kind of stared for a few seconds then repeated the drink order and said alright no problem and seemed to be off to put the drink order in and bring refills. We never saw her or our drinks the rest of the night.  The food we ordered was ok. The portions for the shrimp and crab buckets were very small. Both meals came out in small bowls, with an empty bucket to throw the shells away in.. so I guess that's what the bucket part is about. Which is very misleading. All in all it was not a good experience. I'm not sure if we'll be coming back here. It's a shame too because we really wanted to like it since it's so close to our house.",

I tried the lobster bites and the crab dip both delicious.   The second time I came here I saw a couple that ordered this big shell of seafood which was the clam bake. So my bf and I ordered it since it seemed like it would be enough food to eat. Of course it was...it has clams, crab, corn, potatoes, and sausage! MmMmM just the sound of it makes my mouth water.    Totally worth the place to go to eat some seafood and watch some games. Great location, clean, and friendly staff!",

    "text": "My mother-in-law is visiting from Hong Kong and looooooves raw oysters.  When I saw that Shucks had $1 oysters on Thursdays, I knew that I had to take her here.  My husband and I had treated her to Joe's Stone Crab the weekend prior, where she devoured really expensive, albeit delicious, raw oysters.  So, obviously the $1 oysters weren't going to even compare.    The oysters on the half shell were quite small, but perhaps I need to come on a non $1 each night, to see the True quality.  I also ordered a cup of the seafood bisque, and it was OK.  My in-laws ordered the clam chowder and they seemed to enjoy it.  By the end of lunch, the two of us ate 3 dozen raw oysters, and although they weren't the best I have ever tasted, it was nice knowing that we didn't break the bank to get our fill.    The service is friendly, but it is a little too smoky for my asthmatic lungs. We sat in the non-smoking section, however that invisible wall does not prevent the smoke from seeping into my air space.  If I wasn't so sensitive to the cigarette smoke, I would definitely return.  It is a fun atmosphere, and a great neighborhood bar for sport lovers and seafood fans.",

    "text": "Was craving for crabs for weeks so my expectation was high when I came in here solely to try the snow crabs. Got 1 lb snow crab ($22). It was good and satisfied my craving. Only problem was one of the cluster was missing 2 legs... however,  when I pointed it out to the server they brought out another plate with 2 legs.  Why was it missing in the first place? The legs are the best part.  I wanted to wait to order oysters another time when it's $1 (mentioned by other yelp reviewers) and was informed they no longer have \"happy hour\". That was years ago.  Only special day for oysters now are on Thursday which is $1.50 each.    So I ended up ordering half-dozen which costs $10.99 ($1.83 each)  Didn't like it as the oyster liquor (natural juice) were all drained. Probably will not order it again as I do like to slurp in the oyster liquor with my oyster. That's what make it flavorful.   The New Cajun steak rigatoni also good but just a tad bit too saucy.   Do I recommend it? It's worth a try especially if you have seafood cravings.",

Open 24 hours there are a lot of nice booths and large open space, great bar area.   We ordered take out of a lobster roll, lobster mac and cheese and Jambalaya. The lobster roll $11.99 was HUGE twice the meat and a great taste, even came with French roll and $5 less than Maine Lobster. The mac and lobster ($15.99) was great, I could barely pry some away from the wife. A huge portion, easily feeds two hungry people. Same with the Jambayala I forgot to say rice and got the linguine instead. My mistake. But not too spicy which for someone like me with heartburn was perfect. You can always add hot sauce.  We ordered just before noon, got there 10 minutes later and our food five minutes later. Great service, friendly people and pretty smoke free.  Wife has already picked out our next takeout order next week. Probably will eat in as this is one of the nicest places in Las Vegas. Prices were just great, half of Red Lobster with huge portions.  Now if they would only add lobster bisque to the menu.",

Both sandwiches were good and  big in size. I took most of mine home with my friend's fries since we both ate my tater tots.  The service was awesome. All the servers were cool.

They never try to push you to order anything extra, they don't force you to hurry.. They are very laid back , attentive.. Never charged me for any extras or messed up our food.  You cannot beat their $1 oysters and their burger combo ( fries, cheese and mushrooms included) for under 5 bucks.   My brother tried the seafood omelette, and was impressed with the taste and the price.   The only thing is that they don't have the best beer specials, however that is easy to overlook with all the other great things this place has to offer.  We are going to come back every chance we get.. I'm looking forward to trying their regular menu.",

It came with toasted flour tortillas cut in triangles.  The crab cakes were salty and full of flavors that shouldn't go together.  The Rockefeller oysters and fried shrimp weren't bad.  Garlic fries were greasy and salty.  Ceviche was plain.  Snow crab and peel and eat shrimp was ok.  My advice is stick to the bar and have yourself a beer.",

My mom is allergic to my cat (oops) and can't stay in the apartment for over 30 mins, so I couldn't cook her the elaborate Thanksgiving meal we had hoped for. Thankfully, Shuck's was open and they even had a special menu for the day and $1 oyster specials. The waitresses were SO sweet and kind. I kind of felt like the devil for going to a restaurant on Thanksgiving day but if I had to, I think Shuck's was the best choice.  The Thanksgiving menu was pretty generous, for $11 you got a ton of food and a piece of pie (pecan or pumpkin). The food was solid/good, I'd say their seafood is better than their Thanksgiving fare. Regardless, the fact that they were even open made me super, super grateful, because I don't know what else we would have done!",

Most places like to turn tables quickly, but they were patient and courteous with us. We asked for tortilla chips for the dip because one of our group could not eat the flour chips, which have a great spice sprinkle, with the amazing crab dip, and their response was immediate.  The shrimp ceviche was fresh and flavorful. Mussels had a fantastic broth. Thank you for an amazing night.",

But the decor was nice and warming even though it was a Bears based theme being a packers fan that was kinda rough lol all that aside I like this little place very cozy and welcoming. Lastly I would like to say the service could use a little help I'm sure that because it was early not all the servers were there and maybe they were stretched thin but 30 min to get our card processed was just too much and it's not like the place was packed full also I would not recommend a bloody Mary here very thick and concentrated was not a highlight of the meal at all.",

When the clams arrived the first thing I thought was \"what the hell is this?\" I have never seen clams that were almost 5 inches long. Was very unsettling, but I thought to myself, \"who am I? I don't know if maybe these are different from every other clam I've eaten, so what the heck\" tasted OK, were very chewy, I still wasn't convinced these were actual clams, but kept eating.  About 5 hours later I woke up with stomach cramps, proceeded to vomit all of the food I had eaten, and dry heaved for another hour or so while I began to become feverish. I lost a day of work and needless to say they have lost a customer.  The plus side of the story is that my buddy did not get sick, I checked with him but apparently he did some heavy drinking afterwards so not sure if that affected his toxicity levels.",

They obviously wouldn't carry well. Delicious as always, and you can feel a little healthier by eating all the spinach.   My son had fettucine with a crab sauce. We put some of the sauce on the crabcake. Wow!!! Try it if you can. Amazing.   We carried leftover crabcake, fried calamari, and fried clams to the hotel refrigerator and ate every last bit.

    "text": "The food here is delicious. And service is normally good (but not always). I've had the \"Sea Tacos\" many times. The Philly Steak Mac and Cheese is really good (especially taking it home, three days later). The Mother Shucker burger is HUGE, but good, especially with their crisp tater tots.  The drinks can be strong (but tasty!). I love their different Iced Teas, such as Texas Tea and Hawaiian Iced Tea. If you can get their Fish Bowl, it's delicious! (and dangerous).  As far as smoking goes, it's apparently allowed  at the bar, which takes up over one third of the building. You have to walk past it to get to the restrooms. I've been here many times and the air is usually very good. Once in a while, it'll get smokey, even in the restaurant section. This section is not closed off from the bar area so, of course, smoke travels.  If they would eliminate the smoking, or have separate restaurant areas like the nearby Distill and Kopper Keg, I would upgrade to five stars.",

But that may have been due watching the golden nights lose the Stanley cup. So, I was ok with another chance when he suggested it. When I came in was greeted promptly.....I was surprised at the different food and selections to choose from. I'm not into seafood that much but they have good selection for us meat eaters. We went around 4pm and the place was relatively quiet which isnt a bad thing, the atmosphere was good. When the food came, it was good and hot. My friend and I enjoyed our conversation and the time here. Being a Vikings fan the only drawback was that it looked like a Bears bar. Lol. Seriously though, this was a better experience. I will be back.",

Lots of flavor and chunks of crab on top! Not bad at all. Came with a garlic toast.   Next on my list to try is a lobster roll! Heard good things about that.",

When we sat down we wait about 15 minutes before a server came to greet us and take our drink order. No big deal, they seemed pretty busy. By the time we ordered our food (about another 20ish minutes later) they place had pretty much cleared out. But even with an almost empty restaurant our server (Jeremy, I think?) hardly made an appearance. Towards the end of our meals we stopped him as he walked by and ordered a second round of beers. THIRTY minutes later we had to stop a young bus boy and ask if he could cancel those beers and get us a check. When our server finally made it over with the check he didn't even acknowledge the fact that we had to cancel drinks because it had been thirty minutes!   The food here is really good and fairly priced. But you'd be better off to order to go. There was only two of us and for a sandwich and one beer we were there 2.5 hours. As I stated before, this is not the only time this has been an issue here.",

If you're thinking about breakfast here, just drive further south on Durango to Rachel's Kitchen where they use fresh ingredients. What Shuck's serves is not real food.   Update to the manager, Josh:  I actually called and explained my complaint in length with the manager on duty. He said he wouldn't be able to help me because I had no receipt. I told him that I would be sharing my experience in yelp and he was quite apathetic. Therefore, I am giving you this one star review.

Between those 10 minutes he never checked on the other patrons (there were only four).   The reason for this review is this not an isolated incident (happened three weeks ago with a different server). We gave Schucks a chance after not visiting for a year. But poor service from wait staff (not bussers, they are great).  He could or should have checked on us and the other patrons. But, he did apologize.

Second visit was at the Durango location after leaving work at Centennial Hills Hospital. I was craving for country fried steak so I called ahead and ordered to go for the whole family. It was late and their doors were locked and you have to be buzzed in. I sat at the bar and waited for them to prepare 6 country fried steaks which didn't take very long. He even helped me to my car. I would order from here again if I get out early and hungry for breakfast.   Third visit was at the Flamingo location. My boys and I came from Christmas Town and this was the closest I had bookmarked. Parked right in front and sat ourselves in a booth. It wasn't too busy, you guys know I like that :-) We all ordered a raspberry lemonade and ordered the crab spinach dip right away (too salty) while we decided our entrees.  I didn't enjoy the jambalaya I ordered, it wasn't spicy at all. The chicken alfredo, my 14yr old didn't finish so we took it home. Now the Schucks burger was very much liked. My 11yr old wanted to order another one! Hold on there tiger, that's enough for you today lol",

It's thick, creamy, and most importantly, it's meaty and there's a good amount of potatoes. I can say that their $5.95 bowl of chowder beats all of the $8 to $12 bowls that some fancy seafood places might charge.  I also had the Crab Alfredo. Creamy and a lot of crab meat. It was really filling. Looking at the menu, there are a lot of combos and other dishes too. I can not wait to come back and try more.  Just a note before you pack the family in the car to come here: you must be 21 to enter and the bar allows smoking, the dining area is completely non-smoking.",

If you get the oysters and your have EVER eaten oysters you will immediately know these are NOT fresh and not even good enough to be edible. Gagging by the first bite we all moved to the clams. They were very good but very sandy. So a few crunches will not surprise you. Then we went on and received our main courses. I ordered the coconut shrimp and they arrived cold with fries even colder. My partner ordered the pasta which he said the chicken seemed rubbery and the pasta sauce was yet again, gagging. The burger my friend ordered looked like a joke. Deserts were great. Beer was good. And wine was watered down. I hate giving bad reviews but if this place isn't helped it should be reported to food services. I was blown away.

The oysters were not pan fried, rather deep fried and cooked so hard they literally broke into pieces under the fork. The color was way too dark meaning they were overcooked. The fish was cooked so hard I needed to work the knife hard to cut it open and it split in pieces. The breading was not fluffy like one expects from a beer bar. It was a rock hard shell. I believe they just took frozen factory  made fish planks and threw them into the oil. The fish was billed as cod but it was so dry and stringy I couldn't tell what it was. True, one could say, \"what would you expect from an oyster bar in the middle of a the Las Vegas desert?\"  Well. I'd expect at least to find good tarter sauce. Nope, it was like cheap mayonnaise with pickle relish thrown in.   The mark of a good place is their pride in food and service. Insult was added to injury when I complained about the quality to my waiter, Gregory. I stated my dissatisfaction in an obtuse manner just to see what effect it would have. I told him that now I have something to write about. He said,\"what?\" I said, \"how bad the food is here.\" Without a comment, he turned to take my credit card to the register. I paid for the meal at full price. I was never asked any questions nor introduced to the manager. I will never go there again and recommend against this place to anyone else.",

Not only mine, but the guy next to me had a case of for sure food poisoning if he would eaten his. The second time, I was treated like crap,(ignored, talked down too) I guess-it was because I wasn't a (Regular). And tonight, I was humiliated by the bartender. I was looking for a machine, after eating in the restaurant, I circled the bar 3-4 times. I passed a lady that was not gambling but sitting in front of 3 machines with her friends, she said \"I'm leaving\" I said, I don't want to run you off\". She said I been here long enough, I lost a lot. So I sat down just putting my money in, and from across the bar the female bartender yelled \"We have a waiting list for these machines. I had no idea! I could not believe how rude she was!! I get it, people were waiting. But I didn't know. If I was her boss, I would have fired her on the spot. You don't treat people like that. Three strikes! Their out. Awful place!",

Came in, sat down and I asked if they still had dollar oysters. Sadly, waitress informed us that it's $1.50 now. I looked at the menu and it's actually cheaper by 5 cents if you order a dozen from the menu. Had the oysters here before and it was hit or miss, some were way too small. Food price is overinflated. Food is just meh, for the price not worth it. Much rather go to seafood buffet or oyster bar at palace station at least you're getting your money's worth for way much more delicious seafood. Never again will I come here.",

    "text": "My friend and I wanted to try a new place and didn't want to travel far from flamingo and 215 area. We enlisted Yelp to help us find a place to dine at. Shucks came to mind. After reading all the reviews this seemed to be THE place the be! so we decided to give it at shot.   When you walk in you see is the bar, we looked for a hostess but there's a sign to seat yourself. On the right hand side is the bar with some high top tables to sit at and on the left there are tables and booths restaurant style. We decided to sit at a booth with a large table because we were planning on eating a lot of food. We were greeted by the waiter and he gave us some time to look at the menu.   There is a pretty good selection of seafood and other items such as sandwiches and pasta to choose from. My friend and I went for the seafood. We ordered 1/2 a dozen raw oysters on the shell, 1/2 lb of black mussels, 1/2 lb of manila clams, 1 lb of snow crab legs, garlic french fries, and a crab and spinach dip. seasonings for the seafood we choose lemon and garlic.   The food didn't take too long to come out except for our garlic fries. First, came the crab and spinach dip. Consistency was different than what I'm used to. It was a little runny and had a strong sea food taste from the crab. I'm used to this dip being a little thicker and more creamy.  We had to add some hot sauce, salt and pepper to the appetizer so it wouldn't taste as bland. The chips that came with it were almost a cross between a tortilla and a pita bread.  Next came the oysters. Those were delicious. White meat not cloudy and didn't smell fishy. Then the rest of our food arrived.   Everything smelled so GOOD and mouth watering but when we started slurping and eating everything our noses deceived us. The food smelled so tasty and aromatic but it did not taste the same way. Weird right? I guess we are so used to eating at Hot 'n' Juicy. We finished our meal and I totally didn't even notice that our garlic fries never came out. We flagged down the waiter and asked them if they forgot it? He went to check and said the cooks forgot but it seemed like he forgot to ring it in.   The fries came out about 5 minutes later super oily and shiny with some sort of garlic white powder on top of them. I didn't even want to eat it. I tried one and the moment I bit into it I felt like an oil bubble bursted into my mouth.  This place is nice and clean but the service was a little poor. They only had 2 table sitting in that area with 2 servers serving as well.  The price is good for what you get especially since it is seafood.   So if you are looking for something close in the area with mediocore seafood. This will be the spot.",

We have attempted to go there 3 times in the last month, each time we go in the bar is full which is where we like to eat because we are big gamblers as well.  My problem is each time we have walked around the bar every machine is occupied and 5 out of 10 are with someone either talking to another person, playing on their cell phone, or eating and there is no money on the machine nor are they playing.  The bar tenders at most of the places we go to will not let us walk out and instead will ask someone not playing to please let us have the machine.  NOT SHUCKS they always watch is walk around then watch us walk out.  To bad you don't want the gamblers in i will not be attempting again their loss.",

The clam strips are 4-star or better, and the peel-and-eat shrimp are plump, firm, sweet and meaty. Perfect bar food.   Wife loves the Lemon Drop martini and Mandarin Orange Cosmo. I made the mistake of ordering a 'real' vodka martini only to receive a glass full of well vodka, no detectable vermouth, and two olives. Had it been a decent vodka I would likely praise it, but it wasn't so I won't. .  The two problems I have with Shucks are the uninspired dining room (just an afterthought it appears) and the smokers in the bar.  Obviously a local hangout, and most are smokers. The ventilation cannot cope with the smoke; it's not like a haze hangs in the air but you can definitely smell cigarettes while anywhere at the bar.   You can move to the dining room to escape the smokers, but the dining room is the opposite of special or cozy and lacks ambiance of any variety.",

I'd have to go out of my way to ask for a refill.   Likewise the food is pretty darn good for the price, but again the consistency is hit/miss. For instance I had a great sirloin on a prior visit, but on subsequent tries they never could cook it right. I ordered medium rare and it came out well done, as did the recook the second time. I just ate my vegetables and called it a night. (They did take it off my bill though.)   Also noticed that the last time was very smokey, while the previous visits were not bothersome at all. This probably has something to do with the ventilation system at the time.   They do have great hamburgers though, which are hard to screw up. So I might try them again.",

The reason I was pissed is that during the football season I called them to see if they were showing the Chargers game.  They said yes.  So we drove there and before we parked I went in and asked them again and they said yes.  So we went in (in our Chargers shirts) and sat at the end of the sports bar next to someone else in a Chargers jersey and told the female bartender what we wanted to watch and she said no problem.  We ordered beers and after a while noticed that the Chargers game should have already started.  So we mentioned it to the bartender and she went to check and came back and told us the owner would only let her put the Bears game on (there are a milllion tv screens in there and it shouldn't have been a problem to have our little end of the bar watching the Chargers).  So by the time we fpund another sports bar we missed more than the first quarter of the game.  Seems to me I did enough checking and they should have stood by their promises.  Anyway.... we tried the place again for the food.  It was only OK.  We had calamari appitizer which was OK but I would have liked cocktail sauce instead of marinara for dipping.  Ordered the Shucks salad which had crab, a few shrimp and a decent size peice of seared tuna on it.  The tuna was only so-so but the crab and shrimp was good.  My guy had a bowl of the seafood bisque.  He asked if they had any sourdough bread to go with it and they brought him two pieces of sourdough toast like you would have with breakfast.  Seems to me a seafood place should have some good crusty bread, don't you think?  Do not order the ice tea.  It is not brewed, we had to send it back.",

This behavior will not be tolerated by Veterans and Military action groups in Las Vegas NV nor anywhere else around the country.  Believe me veterans actions groups are going to be outraged at this company.

It's got video poker if that's your thing but I usually come with work friends to decompress.  Not only is it one of the very few 24/7 places out here in this neighborhood, it's FANTASTIC!  Usually have to choose one or the other.  Never knew it existed until a friend showed me, and I've been missing out!  Service is friendly and helpful, the barkeeps are familiar with even infrequent customers, and the food is bomb.  Try the seafood chowder!  It's incredibly delicious!",

The menu is terrific offering something for everyone!  Oysters, shrimp, halibut, cod, clams, crab, etc. All cooked as you like!  I had fish and chips, my husband had fried oysters, and we ordered an appetizer of fried clams. Oh, so good!  And, enough left over for lunch the next day!  Our server was so friendly and accommodating - she really made us feel welcome!  I can't wait to go back to our new \"regular\" fish house!",

    "text": "So I came here with my parents while I'm visiting them in Vegas. The location is easy to find with plenty of parking, but I wasn't impressed with Shucks Tavern. When you walk in, it is DARK. There's a sign that says seat yourself, but it really isn't noticeable when you first walk in. We sat right off the bar area in what I guess is the dining room area. Being from LA, I can't get over people smoking inside bars. I guess Vegas' law says you can smoke in the bar but not in the dining room. Um... the dining room is the same room as the bar so I don't know how you'd escape the smoke. Whatever. I ordered a strawberry daiquiri off the menu only to be told that their blender is broken. For our meals, I ordered fried shrimp with fries w/ steak fries. My mom got a shrimp po'boy w/ regular fries, and my dad got a combo shrimp plate w/ steak fries. Mine came out as ordered but I had to ask twice for lemon. Mom's came with steak fries, which she doesn't like. She wanted regular fries. And dad's came out missing the coconut shrimp (which is part of the platter) because they were \"all out.\" Long story short, something was wrong with at least one thing on each of our plates. Hello?! The service here was really iffy. The food runner looked like he was scared of the customers and our server was full on eating a meal while we were waiting for our check. We probably won't be back because the food was nothing special and the service didn't impress.",

Last night my husband and I decided to go try their hamburgers and omgoodness, please know I am hard to please when it come to certain foods and burgers being one. This burger was just amazing, I was full after eating half the burger but it was sooooo good I almost ate all of it. Surprised they didn't have to call a tow truck to take my out to my car.... But seriously this is a wonderful place if your looking for a awesome burger or breakfast. Also Brit or Brad I think his name is, is a wonderful host... 2 shucks burgers with fries and 2 lemonades $24.00... And it was so worth it... They have Red Robin beat by a long shot",

What is sad is I left $5 tip and the server (Jonnae) doesn't even understand why. My daughter and I ate here on March 1st and ordered the garlic fries, which were amazing. Tonight we ordered the garlic fries and it was missing the parsley. We mentioned this to Jonnae and her answer was, \"Oh it was just for decoration.\" Really, the pink flamingo in front yard is for decoration.

So, last night when I went I was so disappointed when I ordered the lobster fingers again and they weren't that great. Overlooked, over breaded, dry, and chewy.  Then I got the pan roast with clams. On the menu it says that there is also shrimp, crab, scallops, and white fish in the bowl. There was 1, ONE, scallop, 2 shrimp, 2 tiny pieces of white fish and NO, crab!!!!  For $18.95!!!!  What a ripoff!!   Also this place is a borderline dive bar. It reeks!!!  I mean literally the place smells disgusting!!  There is no barrier between the people smoking at the bar and the tables where you eat. And that smell hits you as soon as you walk in the door.  And this place is also so loud I was starting to get a headache!!  And I'm hard of hearing!!  Do not go if you want to speak to the person you are going with!!  It's that loud. Big screen TVs everywhere and I swear they had the volume turned up on every single one of them. They weren't all tuned to the same station but they were all tuned to some kind of sports!!!   Oyster Bar?  No!!  This is a sports bar that you can get some substandard food that resembles seafood.  I won't be back!!!",

    "text": "First time trying Shucks and unfortunately will never be returning. Now I can not speak for the bar service as my experience was in the sit down family portion.   When we arrived it was seat yourself. We sat for about 5 minutes with many servers on the floor and no one came up to us. We were next to the hostesses table so we ended up grabbing our own menus after a couple more minutes of waiting. Finally someone came up after about 10 minutes to see if we had been helped. The first person we encountered asked if the \"two\" of us wanted to order our drinks. Never once asking about a drink for our 3 year old daughter (I guess she was invisible). Next we had a different server come take our order. No personality what so ever and very unpleasant. No smile, nothing. You could tell she was not in a good mood. Other than one other time it was the only time we saw her our whole meal. When done our meal we waited for the waitress to bring our check. There was not one person on the floor at this point (no clue where they all went). Finally after waiting some more we grabbed a bus boy and asked him to find our waitress so we could get the check. ** I will say the two bus boys we encountered during our meal were very nice! Too bad they were not waiters. They could teach that waitress a lesson in having a better personality.   My boyfriend and daughter enjoyed their food. I got steak nachos, but something about the steak tasted weird so I ended up picking it all off. At that point I wasn't about to complain and wait for a new meal. While most the food we had was good it was nothing special to make me want to come back after the service I experienced.   Now granted I know people have bad days, but unfortunately when your tip relies on giving your guests a good experience you need to learn to put that behind you. We did leave her a small tip as she did at least take our order, but that is all the tip covered.  ** Just to be clear, per in the response below, as I don't think it was, we did not tip our waitress poorly due to slow service (that was just part of the review). It was her poor attitude and the experience she provided us that earned her her tip. Food and and food wait times are the restaurants doing, and we understand that. The experience and personality are all on the waiter/waitress.",

Then, we waited for our server to order our dinner. And waited, and waited, and waited.   15 minutes later, our server arrived so we could order. Crab cake appetizer to share, lobster Po Boy for the wife, and I ordered one of their signature burgers. Garlic fries with both of the sandwiches.  15 minutes later, the appetizer arrived. Crab cakes were mediocre, at best. The presentation was nice, the Cole slaw was decent, but the crab cakes were over cooked.  15 minutes later, our dinners arrived. The wife liked the bread of her Po Boy, but the sandwich was missing the tomatoes that should have been on it. She also liked the garlic fries. It was a good size serving, about half her plate, with a good ratio of garlic to fries.  My burger was supposed to have their \"Shucks\" sauce, but it was so dry, I couldn't tell if it had it or not. I got about half of the fries that my wife received, but, my fries had much more garlic. When I finished eating the fries that I could, there was a three inch mound of garlic left on the plate. Simply not edible, and I like garlic!  15 minutes later, we received our bill. Of course it was wrong, the server had added an order of oysters from the table next to us, to our bill. 5 minutes later, we were able her about the error and she said that she was going to correct it. Then, they tried to deliver the order of oysters to us.   Laughable at best.   This is one of those combination gaming pubs/restaurants . Not crazy smokey, but noticeable when you walk in.   The tell tale sign was there when we walked in; there were open seats at the bar, a little after 6 on a college football Saturday night.  It didn't seem to be too busy, but it took well over an hour to get some crab cakes, a sandwich and a burger. Might have been an off night, but I'm not willing to chance it again. This place deserves zero stars.",

You can order a burger and fries for under $4 and oysters are $1, as well as under $4 breakfast.  On this trip we ordered the clam strips ($5) the waffle fries ($1.95), peel and each shrimp($5) and the portions were good sized and very tasty.   I will say the missing star is for the initial lack of service we received upon entering.  There is no signage of \"wait to be seated\" or \"seat yourself\" so we waited a bit and the bartenders just glanced at us a couple of times but still no direction.   Our server was not the greatest but I guess its past everyone's bed time.

Toss a couple bucks in the machine to keep yourself busy as well as the drinks :P  BTW, I asked whether they were KID FRIENDLY...they said YES!  Just not after 11pm...  One of the best places to eat late...look at these prices!  Oysters on the Half Shell ($1 ea after midnight!). These were pretty good, but even better at a cheap $1 bill each! Can't even buy em on the east coast for that cheap!   Oysters Rockefeller ($1 ea after midnight!): Garlic, Spinach and Monterey Jack Cheese. Again, can't beat the price on these! Overall pretty good.  Peel and Eat Shrimp ($4.99 after midnight!): 1/2 lb boiled in a seasoned stock. These were served hot, and had lots of flavor and Cajun seasoning. This HAD to be way more than 1/2 lb though...there were tons of shrimp!   Tasty :D  Fish Tacos ($9.95 not sure of HH price): Grilled or Battered Cod, Roasted Red Pepper Dressing, Pico de Gallo and Seared Cabbage. Not bad!   Waffle Fries ($2.50?). Lightly seasoned...good!  We used these as a starter until midnight hit!  The food is probably only a 4, but at those prices, everything tastes better LOL  Pics!  :",

They brought out three different clusters and none of them had more than one or two legs with meat in them...they said it was because of a bad order??? Whatever. On top of that, only one that was even hot...and it was the very LAST one, and by then I was over it!  Gaming is also terrible. We both played hundreds at the bar EACH time and never saw anyone else hit anything either, which is so crazy. To sum it up? Mediocre food that they WILL comp when you lose at least 600.00, lol.

    "text": "I've been to the Shucks on Flamingo on several occasions for breakfast.  On a recent visit visit I tried the baby Mother-Shucker burger.  It was delicious.  But enough about the other location  Stopped in at this location with the GF to grab a bite.  I found it to be pretty mellow given it was a football Sunday.  Some of the propaganda on the wall indicated this is a Bears bar.  I figure since the Bears played later in the day, this place was probably rocking.  This location is clean, spacious and everyone working was friendly enough.  Looking at the menu, I was reminded of the MOTHER-SHUCKER.  It was so delicious the last time I had it.  I asked myself several times, do I go big or do I go small?  I figured I was hungry enough to give the big one a shot.  According to the Sucks menu the Mother-Shucker is described as, \"a full one-pound patty stuffed with bacon bits and american cheese. topped with lettuce,tomato, pickle planks, grilled mushrooms, melted swiss cheese, fried onion straws and our secret \"mother shucken\" sauce. served on a giant toasted bun. cooked to order.\"  I was given a choice of fries, waffle fries, onion rings or garlic fries.  I picked the garlic fries.  When the meal arrived.  The burger looked outstanding.  I had ordered medium well, but it looked like it was cooked just plain old medium. I am not hating, I can do either.  So satisfying was the burger, I did not have to at all the rest of the day.  I may or may not have been on the verge of meat sweats.  The garlic fries were all garlic and a nice compliment to meal. As was the Honey Brown beer.  The beer came out super cold and remained cool as I devoured the burger.  Not sure if I will ever put my body through Mother-Shucker experience again, but I will absolutely pay Shucks another visit.",

I love oysters so $1 oyster night on Thursdays is great to take advantage of. The service is decent enough. I mean it is a bar so I don't expect super tentative service or anything but the servers are always nice. The prices aren't too bad either.   I had the lobster roll. Now it's not big chunks of lobster meat like I'm used to. It's a lobster salad (which it does state in the menu) with mayo and celery. However there is a good amount of meat in the roll and it is tasty. When given the option of fries I chose garlic. Those were very good as well. They use a fresh make garlic butter with minced garlic over the fries. As far as drinks go, my mother had a mandarin cosmo which was delicious. I've had good experiences with this place so far and will continue to come back.",

We ordered and one persons meal was completely wrong, and my husband giant burger was RAW on the inside. I mean not cooked at all!! Second time service was awful but the soup was good. Tonight and the last time I will attempt this place. My son ordered some chicken wings with onion rings and I stuck with the soup. We got fries instead, I told the runner we had ordered onion rings and he said he would bring them out. Our server, name never told to us, came out and said we didn't order onion rings. I told him I did while my son sat shaking his head yes. He then told me well I didn't hear you but he is going to bring some out. Ok, not that big of a deal, a little rude but whatever. As my son proceeds to eat his wings he realizes there is dark grimy something in his chicken. Idk what it is and it's in the last 5-6 of his wings. When the waiter comes back he asks if we want a box, absolutely not! One of the wings had what my son said looked like bloody eggs in it. The server looks at the food and says so it wasn't good? Really no! He leaves with the plate, so then I have to hunt down a runner to get my bill. I also ask for a manager. After waiting for a long time with no manager in sight I paid my bill and left. We will never return. Service was horrible, food was horrible. 3 strikes you're out!",

I usually order the crab Louie salad. The first time I ordered it, it was way too overdressed now I ask for the salad dressing on the side.  Problem solved. The seafood in the salad has always been really fresh and plentiful too! The last time we were there the hubby ordered the fish fry.  The fish was a very large portion and the batter was oh so yummy.  I have been recently ordering the snow crab and have never been disappointed in the freshness an quality of the crab.",

In the past I've had many a great experience, but the last couple times this has simply not been the case.  I didn't want to believe it at first when I found myself spewing chunks of rotten oyster flesh in to the toilet.  I thought eh I just got a bad batch.  So I gave them a second chance,\"F*ck me right\" I live less than two miles away and I found myself clenching my butt cheeks for dear life half way home. As I sat their, my ass securely suctioned to the toilet seat i vowed to never have another ass pissing experience at Shucks.  F you Dude. F you.",

    "text": "I'll start by saying I'm not a HUGE seafood fan, but the wife is, so we went to Shuck's (conveniently located about a minute or so from our house).   At first it looks like most of the 24 hour gaming/dining establishments in the area, but I wasn't really expected a fancy sit-down place, so I don't mark it down for appearance.   It should also be noted that this is a Chicago Bears bar for the Sunday NFL games, so any of our Chicago implants here in Vegas might find some joy in hanging out with other Chicagoans.  I got the Chicken Club and some waffle fries which was very good and very filling and pretty cheap (about $8.95). My wife got the 2 and a half pound bucket of Snow Crab Legs which seems expensive ($32) but the meat was pletinful and very good and like I said, I don't eat too much seafood.   They bring out all the proper equipment for breaking your legs and wet-naps for cleaning up afterward. So points there for being thorough.   The waitress was not super attentive, and it seemed like they had just one woman working the entire restaurant and bar area. I know it was a Tuesday night, but there were a lot of people in there, you'd think they'd have a second server.   All in all, Shuck's is who I thought they were (that's a Bears/Dennis Green reference for you football fans).   It's a good place to go if you're looking for a better than average meal at a reasonable price (with the exception of the crab bucket). We'll go again, just probably not every night.",

This place has a good feeling, local dive, but clean. The service has always been friendly. I usually go for cold oysters and beer/wine, but definitely enjoy other selections. The stuffed shrimp appetizer is very good, I often find myself scraping the dish for the last of the mushrooms and rice/butter. Crab legs are fun, and this is the first place I've ever eaten dungeness crab, pretty good! I only wish they had Alaskan King crab! The mix and match of cold/hot plates is always a great idea if you can't decide and feel like sharing, too. This is my go-to seafood bar :-)",

A little noisy during football games Sunday and Monday night but if you are a non-drinker this can also be very entertaining people watching. Now for the food, I have eaten there several times and there are no complaints the crab legs are fresh and cooked to perfection as is the fish, the cod is crispy and flakey the mahi mahi is as good as I have ever eaten on any fresh fish market. The service is friendly and they work their %%# off so we make sure they are rewarded well for the excellent service. I can't say enough about this local gem.",

We added on a bowl of soup which was a little salty but good. Then for meals we had the shrimp platter and crab stuffed tilapia. Both were amazing. The time it took to get our food was amazingly fast. We had numerous waiters and waitresses always checking in on us. This place is a must go!!! Only down side is its a little noisy.",

    "text": "If I could give no stars I would!! This was the worst experience EVER!! Being in the service industry I usually put up with a lot and give the bartender a break but he was seriously the worst bartender in the world!! As soon as we walked in we were completely ignored and treated like nothing. There were only 9 people in the bar including us, so not busy what so ever. We looked over the menu for a few minutes ordered a salad and sandwich and seriously waited over 40 minutes for our food!!!!! The couple that came in after us ate and left by time we received our food! Instead of telling us our food was taking awhile or checking in on us the bartender completely ignored us and wouldn't even refill our drink, he dodged us wouldn't make eye contact. When we received our food it was luke warm and tasteless but we decided to eat it cause we were starving. When I asked if the food usually takes 40 minutes he said yeah at night it always does if we're busy...THERE WERE 9 PEOPLE IN THE BAR!!!! YOU'RE NOT BUSY!! He rolled his eyes and acted like I was asking a stupid question. I asked for the check and he said he took care of it, but at this point I would of rather paid the check and stiffed him. Don't act like a douche bag and then expect the world cause you decided to take care of something because you should of at the beginning. You're graveyard bartender is a prick and shouldn't treat locals like shit in a local bar! Seriously I will tell everyone not to come here!!",

He does seem to be really good at avoiding you when you need him though..
