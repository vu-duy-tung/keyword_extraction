    "text": "Being completely honest, I'm usually not a fan of \"special events,\" guest chefs, or the dumbed-down truncated experience of \"Restaurant Week\" but at $26 (after a deep discount from the quoted $100) with friends already planning on attending Chef Akira Back's \"Chef's Tasting\" at Yellowtail I tossed caution to the wind...only to reconfirm all the aforementioned prejudices to a whole new degree, leaving the event after 2 hours hungry, a touch intoxicated, and $26 poorer albeit richer in friendships.  \"Spend the afternoon with us at YellowTail inside the Bellagio Las Vegas overlooking the spectacular fountains. Enjoy extraordinary culinary selections from Chef Akira Back and libations provided by Wirtz Beverage.  Chef Akira Back has chosen to feature the Big Eye Tuna Pizza, Crispy Kalbi roll and his famous Baked Crab Hand Roll among other items.  Gulf Oyster Industry Counsel's amazing Oyster bar. Salty coastal waters produce the world's best oysters for the world's best chefs and restaurants, harvested today as they have been for generations.  Chef's menu will be paired with specialty reserved Sakes, Wines & Spirits provided by Wirtz Beverage and custom cocktails created by the mixologists from Hendrick's Gin and Tito's Vodka\" as described on the website, the actual format of the event was a standing circus of confusion where \"reserved\" tables were fed full trays of food while the rest attempted to hunt down one of four circulating servers that were frequently mobbed and stripped clean at the doors where 'diners' gathered like a group of kids playing World of Warcraft sitting on a spawn spot.  With booze of decent quality and the modicum of food equally competent a total of six mouthfuls of food plus three oysters were accrued by myself (one literally FROM a reserved table) during the course of the afternoon, probably justifying the $26 though certainly not $100 or the overall aggravation.  With no Akira in site and 'live music' that fell through for unknown reasons I can only assume that this 'event' was a money-grab intended to draw high rollers to The Bellagio or an attention-seeker for an outdated property hoping to generate new fans; both goals a miserable failure as we walked out in search of sustenance down the strip at Aria.",

I think everyone who goes to vegas should stop by here and have the Popping spicy crab.  It may sound so peculiar and almost disgusting but the pop rocks actually create a really interesting mouth feel that almost forces you to smile.  Plus the sweetness balances so well with the saltiness.   For some reason the krispy kalbi isnt served with wasabi (need to cut the creamyness of the coleslaw that tops the roll) but they quickly fixed that. Everything is extremely fresh and beautifully plated.  Well worth a stop.",

I was lucky enough to have The Light Group as a client and was given total VIP treatment:  not only a comped dinner, but the best seats in the house on their balcony overlooking the Bellagio fountains  (other diners actually asked my friend and I if we were celebrities - extra points!)  We were greeted personally by Chef Akira Back who offered to bring us all of his personal favorites on the menu and we were so glad he did.  Everything was mouthwateringly delicious but there are 3 must haves:   Tuna pizza - don't ask just eat, it has truffle oil!   Baked crab roll - melts in your mouth better than chocolate Tempura crab - why wouldn't you order that?!  Extra tip - have the sommelier help you with sake pairings; she'll even tell you which ones are good for your skin!  Cannot WAIT to come back here!",

Yellowtail is one of them, not because it has the best food or its the reasonably priced, but its just a comfortable place to go to for decent food with a great view! The other one can't be mentioned, because of some rule about what happens in vegas stays there?  If its not too cold, opt to sit outside. You'll have an unbeatable view of the Bellagio fountains!  The dishes I would recommend:  1) Big Eye Tuna Pizza 2) Seaweed Salad 3) Kobe Short Ribs  The poppy crab roll is a novelty and if you haven't had it, its worth a try. The rib eye is also a decent slab of meat, topped with crushed wasabi root I believe.   To be honest, its not the greatest food here, but there's something that just works for us. Kind of like your local diner, except 5X more expensive, haha.",

The good: The rib eye - sous vide prepared, excellent but  pricey at $49 The view - the fountain show is spectacular  The not so good: The service:  For the pricing of the food, the service is meh at best.  I expect better, this ain't a coffee shop, we shouldn't have to ask for  refills of soda or water.  The appitizers....not served at the same time - spread out over 10 minutes, and althogh the King Crab tempura was tasty, they drown it in sauce so if not eaten immediately, it becomes a soggy dough piece of crab.  The Kobe beef - BEWARE - they told us that they had Kobe beef as a special that night, in two, five or ten ounce portions.  They don't mention the prices and beware it's in the $35-40 range per ounce.  It's heavenly but way too expensive.  They have a Kobe-like flat iron steak for $42 on their everyday menu so it gives the impression the special Kobe will be prices in the same range - NOT.    Lastly, check the bill carefully.  They will offer to room charge it, but be sure to take a look - in error on our bill was three orders of some lobster roll that no on ordered - plus the surprise of the outrageous Kobe - even the waitress and the manager did not know agree on the price per ounce ($35-$42).    Beware!",

Sitting in the patio and having the Bellagio fountains go on every 15 min or so with beautiful music was just so nice. The ink reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is because of the hosts in the front. When I made reservations and requested outside they never mentioned that it's not a guaranteed seating so when I got there they made it a big deal. In any case we waited a little and they did find us a table to sit in the patio and I had a great time. O and it's pretty pricy but usually you get for what you pay!",

A friend got the pop rocks roll which creeped me out at first but after I tried it, it was the greatest thing I have ever tasted! The tempura crab (I can't remember if it was crab or lobster) was also amazing. Scallops were amazing too. So tender, Like eating butter! I got some sort of fruity mixed saki drink which was also to die for!! I can't remember what else we got but it was all amazing.  Our waiter however was terrible. I don't know if it was because we were all younger or what but he just didn't seem to care about us at all. We ended up timing him based on the Bellagio fountain \"shows\". We got seated in the middle of one show, and it took him until the start of the next show to even ask what we wanted to drink. The service got worse from there. He was really nice every time he talked to us but we seemed to burden him. I say this because he was really attentive to literally every other table he had, except us. Was it because we didn't order bottled water?",

Light Group runs this place, and the atmo reeks of pretentious Vegas douche.  But once the food started coming, the truth is...it turned out to be FUCKING AMAZING!! I'm not a sushi snob; I'll eat grocery store California rolls and be happy as a pig in shit. But even my undistinguished palate could tell that this was truly exceptional food. (Someone else paid...if I'd had to pay, I probably would cut off a star or two for it being overpriced and pretentious...as I am wont to do :-)  My friend and I shared lobster carpaccio, the tuna pizza (!!!!!!!FABULOUS!!!), Japanese snapper (!!!!YUM!!!), octopus sashimi, duck prosciutto (shockingly AMAZING, and I hate duck!!), tuna tataki, some kind of crispy pork roll, and another sushi roll that had pop rocks mixed into the rice (sounds weird, but was AMAZING!!). Every single thing was exceptional, but the ones I marked with exclamation points were pretty much orgasmically good. We had some good desserts, too.  It didn't hurt that everything was washed down with a sake flight featuring 6 different types of sake...plus a shot of some cucumber vodka cocktail they feature that was incredible.   I'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5 just because I can't in good conscience give a place this full of itself 5 stars. But srsly... I will MOST DEFINITELY come here again in a HOT MINUTE...as soon as I find someone else to pay for it!! Until then, I'll see you in the sushi aisle at Trader Joe's :-)",

BUT this place goes out of its way to give you the smallest portions known to man for the price of a full course meal for four. I got the chicken and Scottish salmon for me and my girl friend. Each one I could fit into the palm of my hand.... No sides either. For 32.00 each this is ridiculous. I've ate at some of the best restaurants in America and this one was a disappointment.

    "text": "Was happy that my buddies and I could get a table without much waiting on a busy Saturday night . The entrance to the restaurant is rather narrow with bar setup, but once you walk past the bar, the place opens up to a nice and spacious dining area.  One of my buddies was quite intoxicated when we were seated, and he started asking so many questions about how the food is prepared and what goes into each dish on the menu to our server.  My other friend and I were amused, so we didn't interrupt and we really appreciated our server's patience and also his professionalism.   About half way through our meal, another server started serving our table. When this talkative friend asked her to surprise him with a good glass of wine, she brought him one of the most expensive wines (as the rest of us suspected!) on their menu (~$30), but this wine tasted merely ok, not great.   I had sushi rolls and it was very mediocre tasting. Presentation also was OK. I expected more and better food for fine-dining for the money I was paying.   If you really don't care much about food or price, this place offers modern and well polished environment with good cocktails. But alas, you are in Vegas, the place full of many great fine dining places that could offer the same level of ambience and cocktails.   Although I realize if you are in Vegas to party the hard way, the food might not be your main concern... in which case, what are you doing, wasting your time reading this review!",

The group I was with ordered a good amount of everything and we ate family style (although I could have ordered a few things just for myself and been just fine). Our waiter was really nice and helpful with questions we had about the food and the menu.   So there were four \"must-have's\" on this menu. 4. Big eye tuna pizza. 3. Tempura Alaskan king crab. 2. Lobster carpaccio. And coming in at numero UNO, the rock shrimp tempura.   I'd definitely go back if given the opportunity.",

However, the music was heavy, mod. loud, and more suited for the casino or nightclubs than the soft Japanese atmosphere.  Food wise, for the money, Yellowtail was a (big) disappointment. I can't really go into detail because it was that forgettable.",

    "text": "We came here for dinner on Wednesday night before our 10:00 \"O\" show at the Bellagio. We enjoyed several drinks at the bar where I was introduced to a really tasty - and strong - lychee drink. After a couple rounds, we relocated to the dining area and started off with some San Francisco oysters (which, by the way, were so good we ended up with 4 orders....we have no shame) and sake. Our server, Roberto, did a spectacular job - I have never had such amazing service ever. He also made some excellent recommendations such as with the sake selection \"Wandering Poet\" - a fine balance between dry and sweet at a fair price. Our entree was an usual order of spicy tuna roll, bluefin tuna sashimi style, and some whitefish. The ribs came highly recommended so we decided to give it a go as well. I'm not going to lie but I was pretty disappointed and felt like I just got ripped off for a mere handful of meat chunks. Like, seriously? 4 pieces of beef for ~$30?! Of course, this IS Vegas and the quality you get is definitely noticeable, no complaints there. For dessert we moved to the balcony with a perfect timing - the water show! The view was awesome and we enjoyed the green tea mousse which came with a shot of coffee  on the side. Really superb combo. Definitely give Yellowtail a try when you're in the area! PS keep in mind this meal may take a chunk out of your wallet.",

Highly recommend  dinner for two reserved and seated outside to have the view of Bellagio water show. We had sushi and steak. The sushi was fresh, but the Kobe steak was not really hot and it felt like was placed under the cold lamp instead of hot lamp. The rib eye was tasty I would recommend that over Kobe. My wife ended up eating half of my rib eye and I did not mind switching with her. Over all good experience and if you first timer to see the water show that is a good dinning.",

I base my reviews on comparable restaurants, hotels, etc.  First off, you know you're going to spend a ton of money because you're in Las Vegas and in The Bellagio.  If that is a factor for you then just don't go.  That being said, I feel like the food was very good.  The kimchi Brussel sprouts were excellent and the highlight of our meal.  However, the sushi was just very good.  It wasn't amazing and the presentation wasn't amazing; it was just good.  We enjoyed it and enjoyed our cocktails.  Again, the service was exceptional and fun.   I will say that the decor was beautiful and we were able to look out and watch the fountains of Bellagio which was lovely.  Given all the sushi restaurants in Las Vegas, would I go again? I probably would, but only to take first timers to Las Vegas.  There are other places that my husband and I enjoy more.  A solid four to four and a half stars.",

The food was delicious, our waitress was friendly (and apologetic for the terrible experience) and the manager did treat us to a round of shots to help lessen the blow of the dining experience. Onto the not so good.... We went for a birthday celebration. We had a huge party, but we were at 3 different tables to make it manageable. No big deal there, except we weren't all in the same general area. The real problem was getting our food. For a table of 7, half of us didn't get our rolls until the majority of our group of 21 had finished eating and paid their bills. We asked for an update multiple times and even had to remind/correct the staff on what exactly we had ordered and still hadn't received. Sushi is obviously an experience and I never expect my roll to be in front of me within a few minutes, but nearly 2 hours is unacceptable. Worst part... the birthday girl was one of those waiting. Her guests were paying and leaving before she was even able to fully enjoy her dinner. Not a great experience.",

    "text": "This review is for the sushi only.   I understand people not wanting to pay the price of high quality sushi - it's expensive, I get it. But it's truly a culinary experience. When you get good fish, cut with artistry and finesse, served well in a beautiful setting, then it's a price worth paying.   I absolutely love sushi. I've had good and bad experiences all over the globe. This, while not in my #1 slot, it does make the top 5. The cuts are perfect. Thick,  uniform, and precisely sized. The fish itself melts in your mouth, as it should. The edamame was crisp, and well seasoned (I didn't care for the chili seasoning, but my husband did). The seaweed salad was perfectly prepared.   Drinks: I started with an infusion. A pineapple sake cocktail. Probably one of the most dangerous drinks on the planet. So good! The sake selection is extensive and will take another visit to explore more throughly, but impressive nonetheless.   Service: Our waiter was triple sat with us (party of 2), a party of 7, and a party of 10. Come on guys, that's just not fair. But in our servers defense, he handled it expertly. He asked for help from other staff when he was overwhelmed and the support staff always stopped to refill our glasses or clear the plates. To someone who doesn't notice those sorts of things, it would have been seamless. To me it was server perfection. Well done!   Atmosphere: This is a nice get away from the bustle of the casino. You can't hear the commotion from the dining area and the views of the fountains are spectacular! It's a beautiful setting and quite conducive to an enjoyable evening. The music is quiet, yet enjoyable and the decor is hip and trendy, yet elegant and well executed.   In conclusion, I'm sad that yellowtail doesn't get better reviews. While I only enjoyed the sushi on this visit, I would be willing to try more. Including the chefs choice menu with 7 courses and a sake pairing!   Well done over all, Yellowtail. A specific thank you to Chef Akira Back and your team!",

Yes, you could say it is overpriced and not so good and whatmore. Some of the items on the menu could just be considered mediocre, yet their signature dish were definitely worth calling them 'signature.'  My friend and I took all the recommendations of our kind server and had an overwhelming dinner. Their Big Eye Tuna was served first. It was to die for. I personally love truffle oil, and its scent and flavor all went well with the crispy tortilla and thinly sliced tuna. This is a must-try on their menu, and probably one of the best I had the night. Second, we got the Yellowtail jalapeno. There was nothing that really stood out or made it different to other japanese restaurants, so you could skip this. Then, we got the rock shrimp as a finale to our appetizers. This got us FULL. Their portion for rock shrimp which is simply popcorn shrimp marinaded in somewhat like a spicy mayo sauce was huge, but the overall taste got sick after few pieces.   Yes we thought we were full but we still managed to move onto our entrees, the rolls! Our server asked us couple questions and brought us out the Popping spicy crab roll and Happa roll. The happa was a little spicy but it was delicious. THEIR POPPING SPICY CRAB ROLL WAS THE BEST. it was probably one of the best rolls in my whole entire life. You may think pop rocks in sushi roll is weird, but trust me and get this roll. It is worth every buck that you pay for it.   The service was great as well. Just make sure that you have plenty of time if you were to dine here since they do take awhile to bring out your food. Our dinner was done after their signature dessert-chocolate in a cup, which was amazing-- in total we were there for about 2-3 hours. Long dinner but everything was amazing.",

The crispy kalbi roll is simply amazing.  Def one of the better places at this casino.

We got the rock shrimp, seafood ceviche, and braised kobe beef short ribs. The shrimp was a tempura-battered pieces of shrimp drizzled with aioli sauce. The seafood ceviche came with only five pieces of wonton chips to serve with the raw seafood mixture. To be frank, the portions are incredibly small, but I guess that's how fancy restaurants are. The flavor was good, but nothing extraordinary to me. I do have to admit that the short ribs were cooked amazingly well as the meat just slid off your chopsticks. Otherwise, nothing too special. Maybe I should've tried the authenticity of the sushi, but oh wells. Good thing I wasn't too hungry either because the food fit in the palm of my hands.",

Then the subject of dinner came up and I was all for relocating to another venue due to the amount of people we had and the certainty of me having to pay the bill. A quick trip to the men's room and the subject of dinner will be decided. When I got back it was unanimously decided (without my vote) - YELLOWTAIL JAPANESE RESTAURANT & LOUNGE.  Ouch, this was going to be expensive!   The fact is, this is really good Japanese cuisine. The best ingredients, great preparation, beautifully done and very delicious. The menu offered so many variations of what I'm used to on my Ventura Blvd. niche environs that each dish as a pleasant surprise. This was, flat out, a wonderful dinner with fantastic service. Everyone including myself enjoyed the hell out of it, and I will definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone wanting this cuisine.  Was it very expensive - a resounding YES! It's not a hole-in-the-wall place with hole-in-the-wall prices. It's a \"Real Deal\" place with \"Real Deal\" prices. Was I shocked when I got the bill - No. Did I feel I got my money's worth - Yes. So why the four stars and why am I crying; It was one months car payment and I still have to write the car payment check.",

    "text": "I came to Yellowtail, trying to continue the legacy of great sushi meals I have had in Vegas. I managed to do so, but I will say that we ended up ordering more \"non-sushi\" items than we had intended here, and that was fine.  From their hot and cold plates menu, we ended up with four things. Our Bigeye Tuna pizza came recommended, and was quite good. The tasty thin sliced tuna was \"glued\" to flat bread with something - creamy, and neutral, maybe a creamy cheese? That particular ingredient wasn't listed on the menu. The whole thing was topped with drizzled truffle oil, which I frankly could have done without. The more I am exposed to truffle, the more I think the smell is offensive. It's too powerfully earthy, almost a rotting smell, to me at least, and while the taste is not as strong as the smell, it tends to overwhelm my nose, and thus my sense of taste. But this was still good, my anti-truffle campaign aside. The sliced octopus in jalapeno vinaigrette was...fine, but unremarkable. The octopus was tasty, but the vinaigrette needed some more punch. I didn't find much jalapeno in it.  From the hot side of the menu, our tempura king crab was awesome - light batter, flavorful tender crab meat, tossed in a sweet/hot sauce. So delicious, and probably the highlight of the prepared plates. The seafood dynamite was also good, served in a cast pan with corn and mushrooms. Kind of an interesting take, with plenty of chunked seafood. Also worth ordering.  For sushi, we ended up with their popping spicy crab roll - how can you resist a sushi roll with pop rocks? This is gimmicky, but also very good. I liked the crunch of the pop rocks (and the pop) along with the soft crab and crisp cucumber. Their spicy tuna roll was good - heavy on tuna, not just spicy mayo like I've had at some places. And the toro scallion roll had some of the best toro I've had to date. Super tender and flavorful. The scallions did not overpower like I thought they might.  I also had my standard seaweed salad, which here is a mix of fresh and pickled seaweed, for a nice change of pace. Really enjoyable.  Service was good, prices are...well, I'd say normal, but not absurd for Vegas. The restaurant looks out over the Bellagio fountain, so if you get a good table, you've got a great view. Even from the middle of the room, we found ourselves stopping conversation to watch the thing go off. Cliched though it may be, it's still really cool, every time I see it.  Here's to another successful sushi meal in Vegas - 3 for 3. Of note, dress code here is \"casual\" for sure. One of us saw a man enter the bar wearing a bear costume (which included fake abs and a furry hat with bear ears) underneath a suit. So yeah. Wear those sneakers without fear.",

    "text": "I'd have to thank Food Network for this visit to Yellowtail.  If it wasn't for Beau MacMillan's convincing testimonial of their Alaskan King Crab Tempura from Best Things I Ever Ate, I probably would never have considered coming here.  It looked so good on the show, I had to make the effort to try it out.  I came by on a Sunday night without a reservation so the pretty hostess asked if I want to sit at table inside the lounge or outside on their front patio.  So no view of the Fountains of Bellagio which wasn't such a bad thing.  I chose to dine at the front patio as it was a nice way to people watch while I would wait for my food.  As a side note, the hostess and all the waitresses here are really HAUTE!!  Never had Crab Tempura before, but after having it at Yellowtail, I'm gonna look for it at any Japanese Restaurant.  The Alaskan King Crab Tempura was amazing!!!  Not only was it delicious, it was very photogenic as well (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2wg2LWg&s=ec44c89a07039f6f27a6e8d0b41b7bc0d0e1c1271c5228daec9603eb154ca504\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2wg2LWg</a>).  The Crab was tasty and the Ponzu sauce totally enhanced the flavor of the Tempura.  For me, it was a foodgasm with each bite.  At $23, it is quite a splurge considering it's from their Small Hot Plate menu, but they give you plenty of pieces and a side order of Rice went great with it.  Plus, it's not very often that you would find Crab Tempura on a menu at your conventional Japanese Restaurant.  So consider it a different experience when you're ordering it.  My waitress was great and very friendly, and as I mentioned earlier, very HAUTE!!  One minor hiccup about my service was that the person who served me my food forgot to include the Ponzu sauce which was a very important ingredient.  It took a while for my waitress to get the sauce for me which cooled down my food a little bit.  But once she brought me the sauce, the awesomeness of the Tempura totally made up for it.  4.5 stars rounding up!  Yellowtail has definitely earned a spot as one of my To-Go Vegas dining spots.",

    "text": "4.5 stars, rounded up-- mostly for the fact that their service has been the cream of the crop in Vegas every.single.time. Along with this, the restaurant is very hip and trendy yet maintains a beautiful and almost addicting ambiance.   I've now visited Yellowtail on 4 separate occasions, all very impressive. As aforementioned, their service is truly top-notch; At times I felt that there were anywhere between 3-5 wait staff members assigned to our table; on one occasion, we had 7 different members visit our table. However, none of this was overbearing to the point where our party felt uncomfortable or \"too\" helped, if that makes sense. Perfect balance. Also, I'm a water snob, and my water glass was never less than half-full. Wheeee.  Some patrons have docked stars because Yellowtail is so expensive. Well, I can't blame them, as I almost docked a star because of its price tag. I try to reason that \"it's Vegas, and everything is overpriced, and blahblahblah *insert the voice of the teacher over the intercom in Charlie Brown / Peanuts.*\" Anything to assuage the bill's amount....riiiight?   A few of our favorite items include:   --Big Eye Tuna Pizza ($26): Quite the delectable item, but make sure that you don't mind truffle oil! The oil is strong but brings out some additional nice qualities of the tuna sashimi. All served on a crisp \"pizza\" crust, this appetizer is best split between 2-3 people.   --Tempura Alaskan King Crab ($23): My mouth waters just thinking of this...nom nom nom. Tender pieces of fresh king crab with just the right amount of tempura battering. Served with some shaved serrano (think like bitter jalapenos) and a delicious sweet ponzu, we make sure to get this each time. A great starter for 2-4.   --Cucumber Salad ($8): Probably their most basic menu item besides the miso soup, but the bountiful, thin shavings of cucumber mixed with the delicious sweet/vinegary liquid makes this something we always crave.   --******Baked Crab (or Rock Shrimp) Hand Roll ($10): This is probably my family's favorite little dish at Yellowtail. My mom always cracks me up when she says that \"we need to order the little burrito things!\" May seem a bit funny, but these really do resemble mini burritos. We love both variations of the hand roll-- I personally prefer the crab-- and we once got carried away and didn't realize that our party of 8 had ordered 10 of them until the bill came out. Sorry we're not sorry..? I'm sure our waitress loved us that night.   --Popping Spicy Crab ($17): If nothing else, this is worth a try. Very unique with the pop rocks embedded in the roll.   --Shrimp Tempura ($14): Extremely basic, but tasty nonetheless.  TIP: Their specialty cocktails are good, but for $20, I'd rather stick that into a video poker machine, test my luck, and tip the cocktail waitress for 2-3 premium drinks.   Overall: Yellowtail keeps us coming back with its impeccable service, unique ambiance, and fantastic flavors.",

    "text": "My husband came to vegas 5 years ago and literally has not stopped talking about the pop rocks sushi, so when we came this past June for our 2nd wedding anniversary, it was the first place on our list. We ate here before seeing O and waited for about 20 minutes for it to open. We didn't make reservations so I'm a bit confused about how that part works because they wouldn't let us sit inside, they sat us at the \"lounge\" area facing the casino (which was honestly a view in itself, best people watching of my life!) but it didn't deter us. We tried the seaweed salad, which had kale and for the first time in my life I didn't spit the kale out. The cocktails were too expensive for me to try ($20 PER DRINK!) but my husband got a blood orange Grey Goose drink off the cocktail menu that was okay but not worth the price. I digress, for dinner my husband got two sushi rolls (pop rocks was one of them, obviously) and yes it was phenomenal...but the show stealer was my beef short rib. Holy expletive. On the down side, I will never again in my life be able to eat short rib because nothing else will come close to this. Upside? I ATE A MEAT CLOUD! I literally cut it with my effing chopsticks, that's how perfectly cooked it was. I have a video to prove it. It was the best tasting thing I might have ever had in my life and that is not an overstatement for once. It was so beautiful I might cry just reliving the experience while I write this. MEAT CLOUD! CHOPSTICKS! GO NOW!",

And my edamame apps (I believe I had one with sea salt, and one with a chili sauce) were very good (how can you go wrong with edamame??). But wow this place is expensive. Very very very expensive. For two glasses of their cheapest wine, two edamame apps, and a sushi plate, our bill with tip was about $100.   Sorry that this isn't the most informative review about the service and atmosphere (see other reviews for that), but I can't justify spending the amount of money this place requests... even in Vegas.",

I was quite disappointed with the entire experience -- the customer service was poor, consisting of a handful of confused or unwilling servers/hostesses running around trying to ring me up. I paid nearly $50 for an 8 piece roll and a seaweed salad. The quality of the roll was not worth the price -- the rice was hard/not fresh. I felt like I was eating grocery store sushi. The seaweed salad was good, but not extraordinary.  The three stars reflect my previous experience in 2013 together with this one.

The best part, and I didn't know this was an option, one of my dinner guests told the waiter he wanted to time dinner service with the Belagio fountain show - every 15 minutes.  Every 15 minutes we walked out of the restaurant to the balcony (it was a cold night so the patio wasn't open for dinner) and watched the fountain show, came back to the table with a new set of dishes, glasses re-filled, everything clean, napkins refolded or replaced.  The service from the waiters, sommelier, food runners, was excellent. We felt pampered without interruption, all night long.    I can't wait to return!",

The waiters are wonderful, attentive and encouraged some great menu choices. The food is a modern take on Japanese cuisine with some unusual combinations that work so well. The stand out dishes for me and my personal favorites are the tuna pizza and the pop rock roll.  Overall Yellowtail is fantastic, the location in unbeatable, the food is phenomenal and the service completely blows you away. I will absolutely dine here again, and highly recommend to anyone who comes to vegas this is a must!",

We were a party of eight & after a thousand dollars worth of food we were still hungry. The portions are ridiculously small & ridiculously expensive but very good.

I know we had the battered crab, which was really good and I even liked all the fresh sushi. The waitress as nice and was patient with us. I had a beer to drink so cant comment on the drinks. My only knock was the prices. I get it, its Vegas, the Bellagio, etc but your prices are simply too high. Overall food was good.",

The rock shrimp was really good, so we ordered another one which then came out soggy and also took awhile because the kitchen was backed up. Everything else was pretty standard with regards to the sushi we ordered. Overall, the food was ok but I don't think I'll return when there are so many other options in the city off the strip.",

    "text": "Made a reservation on a whim for a 6:30pm dinner on Tuesday for 4 adults and my 9 year old. We were lucky enough to snag a table on the balcony and am so glad we did. The view of the fountains and Vegas strip is amazing. As many times as I have been to Vegas, I have never seen the Bellagio fountain show from this vantage point and am so happy we were able to have our friend and our daughter see this as it was their first time in Las Vegas.   I cannot recall our waiter's name but his service was impeccable as was his team. The adults decided on the 7 course omakase dinner and we definitely made the right choice. Unlike nyc omakase, these plates were larger than what we were used to (in nyc, it's usually 1 or 2 pieces of sushi per course) and included a couple cooked items. Each course masterfully done and timed perfectly in between so we never felt rushed to finish a plate. Absolutely delicious. Truly enjoyed the sushi pizza, yellowtail in Thai sauce, and the scallop just to make a few. Be sure to give yourself at least 1.5-2 hours if you do the omakase though but you won't regret it especially if you have the water to entertain you. We were able to see the sunset and the show lit up at night. My daughter had the California roll and, at first, didn't think she'd like the king crab but she loved it. We also ordered the oysters, yellowtail carpaccio, and wagyu. All terrific! Best wagyu I've ever tasted. So tender. My daughter asked for more but she'll have to bring her own birthday money next time. Haha! Best cocktail for me was the cucumber essence as recommended by our waiter. Not too sweet, but light, and refreshing. Whoever serviced our balcony table of 5 on 6/25, please tell him that we truly enjoyed everything about our dinner including his professionalism, patience, and banter. We will definitely be back again and hope to have you again as our server.  P.S. thank you for accommodating my daughter's nut allergy for the dessert. She loved the tiramisu! Cheers!",

Now talk about the food, there is nothing extraordinary about the quality and uniqueness of their food. Their service is extremely slow. Our reservation is at 5, by the time we finish is almost 7.

Update: to respond to the comment from the owners- the opportunity to prove yourself will never be givin. this was completely & utterly unacceptable for a restaurant that's supposed to be amazing at the least. (you don't just get a restaurant in this location for being \"okay\" or \"shabby\". & honestly Yellowtail didn't even live up to that standard.) it's proven that by your reviews and rating this is obviously not \"uncharacteristic\" of this establishment. i only wish i would have seen it before hand. so to anyone & everyone reading this review- save yourself the $200+ and go to a restaurant that's actually worth your time, your money, and serves quality food. i mean, you might as well- you're paying for it.",

I started with a martini and it had to be sent back because it came dirty not dry with a twist as I ordered. The positives about the food were the salads. They were outstanding and so uniquely made. After the first course I was excited to have the sushi rolls. The four rolls we ordered arrived and they looked the same rather blah not very unique or pretty. I thought the spicy tuna was very good by far the best roll. The California roll was disappointing not having much flavor and the cucumber wasn't pealed so it was bitter. The yellow tail roll was highly disappointing the tuna was fishy and did not appear very fresh. The presentation was sad the roll was loose. The service did improve as the meal went on and our drinks were refreshed.",

Fish was good, especially the Uni.  From a value perspective this seems a bit too high.  If we had spent $300, I'd give this place the fourth star, but I expected much better quality given the price, especially for the rolls.",

Kobe short ribs a little too sweet. Otherwise everything else was delightful. For the Kagoshima wagyu I recommend teppanyaki style. If price is not a concern then this place is worth a visit.",

    "text": "Last week, I wanted to end my trip at Vegas happy, but I was met with udder disappointment. Me and my girlfriend was served by Team 1.   They had highly disorganized team. We wanted a few minutes to look over the menu and the server never came back to us. Instead another server came and took our order. We only ordered 3 items since we only had about 2 hrs before meeting up with friends.  After our order was taken, the previous server came back and asked if we ordered. We told her we did and waited another 15 minute before we were served with Braised Kobe beef short ribs.   Honestly, it tasted like something my dad could make for 1/3 of the cost. Wasn't impressed, but the next item that came did taste amazing. The Seared Diver Sea Scallops tasted Amazing! It was cooked perfectly and practically melted in your mouth.  Here is where I have trouble understanding your service. I had to wait 30 minutes for the Big Eye Tuna Pizza. A cold dish. There was 3 servers that came over and asked me if I wanted to order more. Did it look like I was happy sitting there with no food on the table? I asked one server to check on it and she never came back. The second one actually checked on it and told me it's almost ready. The third one obviously wasn't told that people were working on it already.   It then took another 10 minutes to get the check. Is it because we came in late around 9:30? Is everyone rushing to get off work, so we end up getting a few minutes per server?  So the main reason I'm giving this place a 2 star rating is because of the horrible service.",

However I was told the table wasn't ready which was understandable. There are tables directly in front of the host and we sat there. 25 minutes later I had to go back to the host to inquire about my status. I was told the patrons were taking a long time to finish their meal. We were not seated until a half hour after our reservation time. And while it is not required, a nice touch would have been an offer of a drink. We were not offered that drink so I was forced to get one at the bar.   When we were finally seated it was at an unremarkable table and in light of the multitude of two tops, it is extremely unlikely in my mind a table didn't become available sooner.   A server whose name escapes me was very good. However our appetizer came at the same time as our rolls and I felt like my birthday meal was being rushed. No explanation was offered on the timing of the dishes.   The  sushi is very, very good. We had the octopus appetizer, the California roll (True Alaskan crab), the unagi roll and the tuna roll. I recommend them all.   Besides the Happy Birthday greeting, no mention was made again.    The price of the meal (110$) was reasonable for an upscale sushi establishment. It just didn't feel like an upscale sushi restaurant.    Sushi lunch or last minute dinner? Fine. A remarkable dinner or special occasion? You are better off elsewhere.",

And it was free (which usually makes everything that much tastier, glazed with the sweet ambrosia of victory) since we were using our Vegas winnings, but that still didn't help the cause :/  We tried a little bit of everything -- a few specialty rolls, toro scallion, a couple orders of sushi, yellowtail jalapeno. Along with a bottle of Kirin and some sake. Overall, pretty underwhelmed. The sushi seemed bland, nothing that really stood out, sadness. Especially since we were looking forward to checking this place out!  Hope it was just an off day :/ But they do have a great view of the Bellagio water show!

I told him what I read and asked his suggestions. We had the lychee martini which was great and sockeye pizza, amazing. We also had a yellowtail Serrano dish which I get regularly at my favourite San Diego Japanese restaurant. I always love this dish but at yellowtail the freshness and/or quality of the yellowtail took it to a whole new level. Definitely orgasmic! Size of portions were perfect, but more importantly, the quality may possibly have ruined me for my local place.  Can't wait to come back.",

    "text": "Situated inside the Bellagio, Yellowtail is a Japanese Sushi joint with flair, flair, flair.  It looks more like a small lounge than anything else, but they do serve food - and expensive food, at that.  I don't recall how much the sushi costs, as I don't eat seafood, but the Jidori Chicken that I had was around $25.  When the waitress first brought it out, all I could splutter was, \"THAT'S IT?!\"  I mean, it LOOKED tiny.  But I was so hungry, I decided to just shut up and eat - and good thing I did!  Turns out, it was really friggin moist, well seasoned, and actually a pretty hefty portion!  No complaints from me!  However, the dish wasn't anything sensational.  The reason Yellowtail gets 5 stars is because..  I was star-struck.  Not by any celebrity sightings... but by waitress sightings.  HOLY COW.  EVER SINGLE WAITRESS THERE WAS HOT HOT HOT!  I'm not just talking \"pretty,\"  I'm talking \"HOT\"!!!!  With MANY MANY exclamation points.  Hotness must be a requirement to work here!  That's not to say that every waitress was a cookie-cutter Barbie.  Nope!  Brunettes, blonds, redheads, White, Black, Hispanic, Asian, tall, short, voluptuous, model-skinny, girly, tough, bitchy, friendly... The variety was endless - but in an oh-so-gorgeous kind of way.  Every single one of them.  I'm not a lesbian, but even I got a little giggly around these girls.  For sheer eye-candy alone... I have to give Yellowtail five stars!!!",

During my last trip to Vegas, my friends and I checked out Yellowtail and tried the following menu items:  -Big eye tuna pizza: WOW... this was so good.  I loved the contrast between the soft tuna and crunchy pizza crust. -Kumamoto oysters: super fresh and perfectly scrumptious.  -Kobe beef tataki: melted in my mouth.  -Yellowtail tataki -King crab tempura  -Popping spicy crab roll: yummy and the popping candy was definitely a nice surprise! -Unagi roll  Yellowtail's menu is definitely one of the most creative and innovative ones I've seen.  I love how everything on the menu was so unique... I wish I could've tried it all.  Plus, the ambiance is fun and trendy and the service was great.    I can't wait to go back!",

The portions were unbelievably small (we ordered 4 sushi rolls for 2 people and were definitely still hungry - I mean not even a tad bit full).  I figured that could somewhat be the case, but I seriously think these were the \"skinniest\" rolls (not sure how to describe it!) I've ever seen.  Not very thick at all.  Like mini rolls.  They tasted ok.  But, I will say - our table was near the patio, so we were able to walk out and take photos with the water show, so that a definitely a plus.  The restaurant is also nicely decorated and I like the huge gold fish tail on the wall outside of it.",

    "text": "On a weekender to Vegas, my gf and I were hungering for sushi one night and the concierge of our hotel (Monte Carlo) suggested going to Yellowtail, the newest restaurant at the Bellagio.  Only open a week,  one might expect some hiccups along the way, but the food was top notch and the service was even more so.  The outside entrance signals the restaurant's presence with a beautifully decorated, massive glass tile mosaic of a yellowtail fish.  Indoors, posh, elegant, with clean yet comfortable lines in a contemporary style.   Seated at the bar (since we had no reservation), the service didn't slack one bit as our bar waitress was more than knowledgeable, explaining the vast menu choices and offering helpful suggestions on what to order.   Despite the busy atmosphere of having to juggle bar mixology and restaurant patrons, she checked up on us often and made us feel comfortable.    Food wise, my best description for this dining experience would be - sushi fusion.  Combining East and West sensibilities into sushi produced some unique flavor combinations that I've never tasted before.  I'm not talking about your typical California roll here.  Think banana flavored sake, strawberry topped rolls in place of unagi, Big Eye Tuna Pizza with shiso, Toro Sashimi with caviar and microgreens.  The crab dynamite was delicious with generous chunks of crab meat, and a hint of spiciness.   One of their signature selections is the Grand Omikase, a six course tasting menu based on the chef's* fancy that day.  I would highly recommend this, as it's the most bang for the buck, and you get to taste a vast array of flavors.  Kobe beef fans will be satisfied as this includes  Washu beef (a domestic breed of Kobe) offered in a tenderloin cut; a texture that just melted in my mouth.  Some might think sushi fusion is a bastardization against tradition, but I think it's fun.  Why not try something new?  Your palate might thank you for it.  *(Head chef, Akira Back, has worked with industry greats such as chefs Nobu and Morimoto.)",

We're friends with some staff thus they opened up the patio (which was closed that night) for us during the water show so that he could propose.  It was quite a picturesque scene.  The staff was very friendly and accomodating and got us comped into the bank nightclub afterwards.  Awesome.  The food - we were all still pretty full from the paris champagne brunch so we ordered light.  I got their signature banana unagi roll and strawberry roll (it has pop rocks on top!)  The banana roll was impressive as the banana flavor was evident but not overwhelming.  And no whack filler like cream cheese!  My friend ordered salmon sashimi, but it was smaller than my pinkie finger.  I felt bad for him, but otherwise, a great night and venue.",

First and foremost: the big eye tuna pizza with white truffle oil.  Just get it.  That's all I'm going to say.  Secondly, ask for the patio.  It lays directly over the Bellagio fountains and provides an amazing special occasion experience, especially for newcomers to impress.  Otherwise, the inside area has a more bustling, active ambiance.  In addition to the pizza and the patio, I'd also recommend ordering the miso glazed cod which is not on the menu for some reason.  Although it is not as good as the original (Nobu), it's definitely up there, albeit a too-small portion.  My only gripe would be the less-than-sweet (I'm being nice here) hostesses, which is why I'm only giving four stars.  Yea, less attitude would be appreciated.  The servers are awesome, however.    I'll be back.",

We also ordered the Seared Albacore which came with crispy mushrooms and onions.  I didn't care too much for it, but everyone else in my group liked it.  We ordered a ton of sushi rolls and sashimi.  One of my favorites was the Popping Crab, it has PopRocks in it!  A  nice surprise.  The salmon sashimi was also melt-in-your-mouth-like-butter good.  The potato puree and baked corn sides were so good, we ended up ordering more.    The chocolate mochi dessert was very good.  So was the lava cake with foam and vanilla with chocolate on top.

Started out with, The Tofu Miso Soup, Lobster Carpaccio, and Kobe Beef Tataki. Oh my does the Tataki own! Loved it, the amazing blend of garlic and sea salt. Next came out the Cucumber salad. Everything was so yummy, I must say.   For our entrees we got the Jidori Chicken with veggies, and I got the Kobe Flat Iron with veggies. The chicken was really good, juicy and well flavored but def not a dish you would eat with chopsticks in my opinion. I'm a Flat Iron-oholic and this was no disappointment! The only thing I think Yellowtail is lacking on is a solid selection of dessert. I have a serious sweet tooth. :) All in all, Glitz and Glamour. I'm enamored.",

    "text": "the best place to watch the bellagio fountain show?  at one of bellagios fountainside restaurants.  we made a reservation at yellowtail the day of dining and had no problem.  they gave us a table outside and while eating we saw three fountain shows as the sunset.  definitely the best views of the strip ever.  yellowtail serves sushi for a very high price.  and as the food came we joked that we had to go to mcdonalds afterwards.  we ordered the big eyed tuna pizza which the server said was the most popular.  it had truffle oil and was pretty good.  bascially tuna on crackers.  i had seaweed salad - nothing spectacular here except the price.  and also a clear soup - again nothing spectacular.  thei lobster carpaccio is not raw.  the lobster has been poached.  they have this really high energy sommelier/sake specialist (?)    for dessert mochi and tempura ice cream.  a bigger ball of ice cream would given us more ice cream after frying.  we got a lot of melted vanilla ice cream on our plate.  i never order mochi because its not like they make it.  they just buy it and put it on a plate and charge us much more.  and for the record we did have to eat after this.",

We ended up coming here not knowing that this was a brand new restaurant, and once we got here we had the impression that they had been around for a while based upon their service, quality, and professionalism.   Their rolls are amazing! In fact I liked them better than Nobu.  Try their Yellowtail and scallops roll, soft shell crab roll, and definitely try their crab roll with pop rocks!  Their Mochi is also quite good.  Oh and FYI - the chef is from Nobu.   I really, really, really liked their service. Everyone was extremely friendly.  The manager even came over to chat and even gave us passes to The Bank!",

The yellowtail/scallion roll just tasted like kimbap.  You know..the fish just was ehhhhh.  Pros:  Great service. Very polite and wasn't pushy about ordering their most expensive thing on the menu like some places in vegas.

It took the server quite awhile to bring out our drinks.  Then we waited over 20 minutes for our edamame.  After 30 minutes of waiting for 2 sushi rolls (we were just getting a snack), I finally was able to get our server over to our table and ask what was going on.  Her response was that they were really busy; which was not the case.  Let me also say, once we had our drinks, she NEVER came back to our table.  Our food was brought to us by runners, and our server never even came back to see if we wanted another cocktail.  I have to say the food was excellent, as usual, and also very overpriced but I knew that going in.  I give the food a 4, the price a 2 and the service a 1.  Overall for me, terrible experience.",

Our table ordered two plates of it at the end of the night it was so good!! The sushi was good as well, but not incredibly outstanding. Overall I would recommend Yellowtail and DEFINITELY recommend a table outside.",

The restaurant wasnt too crowded and our waitress was super cute. First, we ordered the Spicy Miso Soup....if you like spicy food-order it and thank me later. That soup brought tears to my eyes but did it stop me...Hell no! There was also bits of shrimp and seaweed and the soup but honestly I expected more soup for $8.00.  Next, we ordered spicy tuna sushi and it was pretty good-the tuna, rice and seaweed was pretty fresh. No complaints there but nothing spectacular either. Last but not least, I ordered the Edamame and it comes 2 ways...Salted and with a Sweet coating...pretty appetizing...very different. Finally, we washed it all down with our $4.50 glass of Coca Cola....(hey its Vegas...whats a $4.50 soda).   We had a pretty good experience here at Yellowtail....I actually had better sushi at a strip mall in VA but, hey...its Vegas :)",

My group sat in the lounge part on a Saturday night. We enjoyed an awesome bottle of sake and really amazing sushi.  The Big Eyed Tuna Pizza is an absolute must order!  My group ordered two! :) We also tried the Popping Crab Roll!  I loved the new twist this restaurant puts on the same old sushi dishes.  The service was a little slow at times but not awful.

    "text": "Formerly Shintaro at Bellagio, Yellowtail is the Bellagio's attempt to cater to the younger hip crowd. The decor and ambiance are nice. The bar setup is cool. A few more specific comments  - on a busy night they do not give beepers or have any way of tracking you when your table is ready. So keep a watchful eye or they could skip you! - drinks at the bar are about $14 for cocktails (the kiwi one is tasty), to $12 for large Asahi. Reasonable for Vegas, but still on the high end. - Sushi rolls are pretty tasty, but be forewarned that they are SMALL. They roll them tight with not much rice. Not too much inside either. So while you may think a roll for $9 isn't that bad, you only get a small portion. So you must end up ordering more than you thought just to not be hungry an hour later. - Bill for my wife and I. We each ordered 2 rolls, plus some sashimi. 2 cocktails and one large beer, with tip came to $150. Luckily we charged it to our MGM room which has a 30% off promotion via Mastercard until January 31, 2009 - otherwise it was a complete rip.  Food good Ambiance good Service acceptable Price excessive  Simply for better and larger sushi (and cheaper), I suggest the sushi bar inside Caesar's Palace (next to Cleopatra's Barge).",

My wife tried the Kumamoto Oysters and while they were a bit on the small side, she said they were very good.  She also ordered the Baked Crab Hand Roll and said it was fantastic.  The Japanese Yellowtail Roll Sushi was average and I would not order that again.  I have had better at Hole-In-The-Wall places for half the price.  They did have a solid wine list by the glass and my wife tried one of their signature drinks as well.  It's a bit on the pricier side.  Our bill with drinks and tip was roughly $200.  The scenery and atmosphere on the patio were also fantastic and made the mood.  Our server was also attentive and even helped us get a great angle for a picture.  We will return for sure.",

In addition, this place is great for kids. They have fancy high chairs with cushion for thr kids. Not the basic wooden high chairs.

The reviews complaining about price on this wonderful spot seem more geared towards their own financial situations rather than the atmosphere, staff, service, and food. If you rate Yellowtail as a 2-Star because your edamame was too expensive.. A) Read the prices before you order, B) Visit Paruhmp or China Town  PS - One of the BEST views in LV!",

A waitress approached me and said this is their bar area and I couldn't sit here to nurse my baby. I looked around and there were about 15 tables and had only 2 tables that were being used. I was very upset and asked where can I nurse my baby then. She said we have a RESTROOM. You don't eat in the bathroom then why should by baby eat in the bathroom?! What is wrong with you guys?!!!! You guys ruined my baby's meal time and my family's dinner.",

The wait staff is smart, they anticipate your needs and take good care of you throughout the meal.  The dishes come out quickly and everyone is very nice and pleasant.

    "text": "This place is so expensive but also so good! Probably one of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas. I always leave this place satisfied and wanting more and with a hole in my wallet lol. Well, technically I'm not the one paying but you know what I mean. Last time we came with the party of 8 and the tab came out to be around $1,600 including tax and tip.   Let's talk about the setting of the restaurant. It's located in the casino of Bellagio. It's next to the fountain. If you get seat by balcony like we did, you get to experience the fountain show from inside the hotel. It's a completely different feeling than experiencing it on the Strip. It's much closer that way and you can enjoy it without being in a huge crowd of people. As you'd expect from a high end restaurant, the setting inside is fancy. It's dim a little giving sense of romanticness, so it's a perfect place to take your date.   The food. There large selection of food and honestly they're all great. Though these are my personal favorites: tuna pizza, yellowtail, flat iron steak, ribeye, and Scottish salmon.   -The tuna pizza is a thinly sliced pizza served with raw tuna on top. I thought it was an interesting combination at first. I mean, raw tuna on pizza? Does that even go together? Oh man, let me tell you, it does. And it does great. It has the soft and juiciness of the tuna and the crunchiness of the pizza. This was our party's favorite and we just kept ordering these. They come at $29 a plate though.  -The yellowtail has got to the best yellowtail I've eaten. My go to food at most Japanese restaurants is grilled yellowtail cheek, so I've tasted plenty of yellowtails, but this is honestly the best one I've tasted. Well I mean you'd expect it to be good, afterall it's the name of the restaurant. The fish is juicy and soft and just melt in your mouth. It's not dry like some places.  -I'm going to review the ribeye and flat iron together. They were both great. The quality of beef is excellent and it's super soft. However my only complaint was that they were a little burnt. Maybe the chef was a little off today, but the outside of the beef were a tad bit burnt. This wasn't the case with my previous visits. Aside from that it tastes heavenly.  -The Scottish salmon also tastes great. Not much to say about it. Just your average salmon, but they just somehow seasoned it and made it taste so good. Maybe the chef used his secret sauce or something? ;) lol jk but seriously it's good.",

I'm in Vegas quite a bit and I always make a point to go to Yellowtail. In fact, I might even make a trip to Vegas JUST for Yellowtail if I had the means!!  That being said, the reason for my devotion to this place is the Big Eye Tuna Pizza and Pop Rock Crab!! I have the pizza as an appetizer (obligatory table sharing) then I order it again as my main course (no sharing!) along with the pop rock crab. No other sushi place has these gems to my knowledge, and the chef should trademark them if he hasn't already.   Service is usually pretty good, I'm in heaven with my meal that I actually don't care how long it might take to get it nor do I care if the waiter is rude....I wouldn't even notice if the waiter is rude since I'm in my ultimate happy place. (I'm not saying I've had rude waiters or slow service, to make that clear)  All of this costs WAY more than I'd usually pay for sushi but hey...it's Vegas, it's Bellagio and it's WORTH IT!!",

You'd think we had asked for her new born when she asked why with the nastiest tone. We explained and she said to ask our server, we tried to explain we were in a rush and the server was running around helping so many others.

When they got their mains I was 30 Min after the food. The salmon entree with some creamy cucumber dressing is 5 stars and highly recommended. Tuna pizza appetizer is highly recommended, 5+ stars.

It was SO good I went back the next day for another, where he also suggested the Yellowtail Jalapeno dish. He further suggested I dip my Protein roll in the sauce the Yellowtail comes in. Absolutely, eye closing, amazing food moment. The only bad thing I can say is that I won't be able to experience this as often as I'd like. Wow.",

It was packed, packed, packed on Saturday night and we didn't have reservations. The girls at the desk had us wait a few minutes for a table in the bar. It was lovely.   They waitstaff was attentive, but not intrusive. Service was smooth, and best of all, we loved every delectable bite.   Japanese art in the gallery. Japanese food in our bellies.

Three favs that are an absolute MUST in this order:  Protein Roll * Similar to a Rainbow, except instead of rice, it's real crab wrapped in soy paper, topped w/ Tuna, Salmon, Hamachi, Shiso, asparagus.  Wow!  ($32)  Big Eye Tuna Pizza * thinly sliced tuna w/ a cream sauce on top of a cracker thin crust & topped w/ micro shiso & Truffle Oil.  The best way to eat this is to scoop one half of the tuna onto the other half of the pizza & enjoy a larger amount of tuna on each slice mmm! ($27)  Strawberry Roll they used to have it so maybe it's a seasonal Roll that I love topped w/ sweet strawberries, thinly sliced.    Overall, wonderful environment & view, on top of the food   & wonderful bartenders, I highly recommend Yellowtail!",

    "text": "Yellowtail. (3.83 stars).  \"Hamachi: the Japanese name for Pacific yellowtail, especially when used in sushi and sashimi.\" - Google  I first heard of Chef Song Ook \"Akira\" Back when Chef Back was on Iron Chef & he battled Chef Bobby Flay. I was secretly rooting for my fellow Korean (after all I am half Korean). Sadly, Chef Back lost, but he gained an instant fan!!  I think the Iron Chef battle was sometime in 2008 because I ended up at Yellowtail in the Bellagio for their grand opening in 2008.  I have been to Yellowtail at least 10 times since their grand opening, & I have to say, it's still a nice place to relax & unwind!!  I enjoy the vibe & being able to have a lighter meal & cocktails in the evening.  ---  Ahhh yes, that glorious meaty fatty melt-in-your-mouth fish that is known the world over as HAMACHI!!!  Yes please!  Ironically, my favorites at Yellowtail aren't made with Hamachi...  Yellowtail is a an upscale sushi bar & lounge where Chef \"Akira\" Back hones his love of Japanese food with a twist.  I have tried many of the items on the menu so I'll review 1 item I would pass on & 2 I usually order when I'm here:  Big Eye Tuna Pizza. (3 stars).  Chef Back's most popular dish is his signature Big Eye Tuna Pizza.  While the Tuna is sliced deli thin & delicious, I feel the truffle oil overpowers this dish.  I do love truffles & I do love truffle oil, but I find myself smelling truffles HOURS after I have eaten this pizza.  That tells me, there is too much truffle oil for my liking.  The micro shiso greens do give a nice crunchy texture but much like the tuna, they are overpowered by the truffle oil.  The \"crust\" is a thin crispy shell which does add a crunchy & enjoyable texture but this is one of those dishes that u will either love or despise.  U won't really know until u try it.  If u get this pizza to share, one slice is more than enough to taste the flavors & move on to another dish.  The BF said the truffle oil is too potent for him so I was forced to dump 3/4 of my pizza. Boo!!  Tuna Tataki. (4 stars).  Every time I visit Yellowtail, I always order this. I think it's because it's so simple but luxurious in quality & taste.  Plus, I get to see each individual slice & inspect its quality while admiring its beauty...  I am from Hawaii where Ahi is KING!  But I have to say this tuna tataki is light, subtle, & silky in texture. A nice firm fish that melts on contact with my tongue. Surprisingly great quality tuna for a restaurant in the middle of the dessert!!  While Chef Back's sushi rolls are fun to try, I come here to enjoy a semi-naked fish basking in all its glory... in a pool of spicy mustard sauce.  Delicious to the last bite!  I order this when I have wicked bad cravings for ahi & I'm not in Hawaii.  This tuna tataki has got me \"hook, line, & sinker\".  Duck Prosciutto. (4.5 stars).  Perhaps I love this dish because I rarely find it on any menu?!  Of the few places I have had duck prosciutto, Yellowtail is my favorite place to have it!  The fatty salty curing that these duck breasts go through make them all the more delectable.   Yellowtail's version isn't gamey at all. Just a deli-thin slice of duck which is so delicious with an ice cold beer!!  The saltiness is addicting & the micro beets give the duck a lightly floral flavor while adding a nice crunchiness.  I love rolling the greens into each individual slice of duck and eating it like a roll.  This dish is really what entices me back to Yellowtail after all these years. Maybe not the best in the world, but the best I have had thus far!  Ahhh... the perfect quack... oops I meant bite!  ---  Service is always friendly.  If u have a small party, I highly recommend sitting at the bar!! The bartenders are extremely knowledgeable & friendly. The cocktails at Yellowtail are innovative & delicious.  I'm an \"old-fashioned\" kinda girl... *Angelic smile*  Yellowtail is located closest to the North Entrance near Prime & the tram.  MLife comps can be used here.",

Our waiter was very attentive but not overbearing. Just right! When the fountains started the servers stepped outside and took pictures, if requested. The food we had was fresh and delicious!! We ordered edamame and the pickles to start. My ONLY negative was that I didn't care got the pickled veggies. I love LOVE pickles but these didn't hit the mark. The dirty martini was sooo smooth and well balanced! Went down nicely!! ;)  For dinner we had the Flat Iron steak, spicy tuna roll, rock shrimp roll cut and the mile high roll. ALL of these were fabulous! The mile high had a nice kick to it! The spicy tuna roll lived up to its name but is better with a few sliced jalapenos on it. My favorite was the Rock Shrimp roll!! It as so different from most rolls I've had. It had some shrimp tempura and was covered in soy paper. It had a crisp crunch inside was creamy and delicious! Almost yeasty and addicting like a fresh buttered roll!! So good I ordered another one!! We have enjoyed Kumi for years but this was our first time here. It is my new favorite! Give it a try, I'm sure you'll love it too.",

    "text": "We went here on a birthday splurge, per my moms raving recommendation of the food here. We sat in the back and were immediately greeted with steller service and recommendations.   Appetizers: --  Seaweed salad: came with two types, one with an overwhelming oceanic taste and the other a salty and sweet clear green thin type found in most restaurants. I liked this one but the fresh seaweed was almost too powerful to handle.  --  Cucumber salad: light and refreshing, they use some great white vinegar to enhance the flavor. Makes a great refresher in between complex dishes. --  Miso soup: the best I have ever had. --  Grilled Eggplant Skewers: one of my favorite dishes, this eggplant is cooked PERFECTLY, and has the best sauce I have ever tasted. It is like a caramelized miso reduction and if you like eggplant you need to try this. I think it was around $12 so for being the cheapest app on the menu it was by far the most memorable! --  Big eye tuna pizza: We tried this one because it won \"best appetizer in LV\" (according to our waiter). It was good but not spectacular. I will say that you will definitely taste the truffle oil. Also, the salmon was fresh. Not worth 26 though. -- Scottish Salmon Carpaccio - Another winner, fresh fresh fresh! The sauce (Yuzu Soy I think) was delicious  Entrees and rolls: -- baked crab hand roll : SO GOOD. THIS IS SO GOOD. I MEAN GOOOOOOOOD. If you like your sushi with a little oomph and cream sauces then get this. for 10 bucks it is well worth it! -- rock shrimp hand roll : I liked the flavors a lot, but the roll is a bit more of a dry one in comparison to the baked crab. **The paper that wraps these two rolls is unlike any other I have experienced, I would go back just to have this style hand roll again.  -- california roll : tasty and standard, again aim for the more unique dishes here  -- spicy tuna : not much more than tuna and rice. I liked that they were very spicy  -- oysters - creamy and very good  Drinks:  -- Lychee - This one was good but for $20 it wasn't great. There was a strange flavor to it that was not sweet, empty and unsatisfying. (It was too unusual to compare to something else though). I will give them points for strength, the cocktails most assuredly hit the spot.  -- Essence - cranberry cucumber flavors, extremely refreshing and mild.  Overall go here for appetizers and drinks, do not waste your money on an entire meal. We spent around $500 for 4 people in total.  I will give it 4 stars because for as much as we spent, I was expecting each dish amaze me in some way or another.",

So getting the reservation or a large party was a little bit difficult especially on fight weekend. They accommodated us with a phone call about three days before.  Service - pretty decent. Very responsive with a large party but thats because tip is guaranteed. But they did fill our waters and had decent suggestions. Also they were very responsive and helpful.  Food - Each group of 4 people ordered their set of dishes. In my group we had a hardcore sushi person, two experienced sushi eaters and one non sushi eater.   We ordered the tuna pizza, which was pretty good, the non sushi eater liked it. Along with tha we ordered 4 rolls, a unagi type roll, a soft shell crab roll, a tempura roll of some sort and a tuna roll. We also ordered a Wagyu beef dish that was probably the highlight of the meal. We also had a snapper dish which definitely one I would come back for. I am not much of a roll person, so I can't say they were that good nor that bad.  The non sushi eater was pretty good at taking down the rolls, so in that sense the fish was pretty decent. The tuna pizza is more of a novelty, sorry toro, or hamachi are number one on my sushi wants.  Decor - It was a very modern setting and the view we had was outstanding, it was a great view of the water show at the bellagio, it can get pretty noisy in here so don't look here for a romantic dinner unless you like raising your voice to the person across from you.  I'll admit it wasn't my first choice (Comme Ca was) but it proved to be good for a not too filling meal, which is what we aimed for.",

Sake / wine / beverage sommelier was really over the top and an aggressive up-seller, not appreciated.  Service was sporadic and they forgot our edamame order.  Portions could be larger, but every bite is delicious. The quality of the food helped counterbalance the negatives.  If you can dine out by the fountains, be prepared for some misting... but an exceptional view!",

We got a table in front of a couple (elderly white guy and young asian girl with really short skirt).  It was definitely a cosy seating area and we were able to do some people watching since we were literally next to the walking area and people were passing us by.  We ordered two drinks, normal cocktail type prices.  A bit loud around us, but we definitely made the most of it since we were in our own little happy bubble.  We spotted some \"whoo\" girls near the entrance (you'll need to watch How I Met Your Mother to understand that reference).  Can't believe they do exist though... Good place to just lounge and enjoy time with someone special =)",

He had a Happa Roll and a couple of pieces of sashimi. I had the Jadori chicken and their roasted corn as a side. The hubby loved his food and so did I. So many sushi places just serve plane chicken but this was so delicious. I will try to post pics later. The roasted corn was SO yummy. It was definitely a small portion for the price (10) but delicious in deed.   I had 2 cocktails, a pineapple and a strawberry. The drinks are pricey, $20, but they are strong so I could have easily had one. But hey I was on vacation.   The staff was SO nice and courteous. There was no snootiness here like at some of the restaurants in the strip.   And lastly, we sat outside and were able to enjoy the fountains. Just perfect, other than the price tag ;)",

    "text": "After seeing this place featured on \"The Best Thing I've Ever Eaten,\" I was ecstatic when my friend decided to treat me out to dinner here.  Unfortunately, Yellowtail fell quite short of my high expectations...  ATMOSPHERE Located in the Bellagio, Yellowtail definitely has some swag (I mean, that giant, bright, metallic, golden fish hanging out on the wall definitely screams \"Vegas\"). It was a pretty swanky place so I had some high hopes.  The server was really nice, but she accidentally gave us someone else's bill on top of ours...   FOOD 1) Tempura fried king crab appetizer 2) Red snapper sushi 3) Shrimp tempura roll 4) Salmon sashimi 5) Angry salmon roll 6) Toro scallion roll  The TEMPURA FRIED KING CRAB was fantastic. I wish we just ordered a few of those instead of the sushi and sashimi. The crab itself was juicy and the tempura was perfectly crisp and crunchy. The dish tasted so good with the ponzu sauce! The scallions were a great finishing touch because they added that final subtle zing to the dish.  The SUSHI and SASHIMI were both mediocre at best. The rolls were small and they weren't that creative. The only good thing about the sashimi was that it was presented in the shape of a rose, but it wasn't the best sashimi I've ever had.  Overall, Yellowtail is overrated and overpriced. I feel like I had better sushi at Ichiban in the basement of Bally's for 1/10th of the price.",

Chef Arika Back brings much more to Yellowtail, offers classic Japanese cuisine, which features innovative dishes that utilize fresh ingredients.             We frequent here for snack with the casino host; this time we had a quick bites with Julie K., but the food here is always consistent and yummy. Service is quick and we love sitting at the bar, to try all the sake cocktails.  - Shikoku octopus with cucumber and jalapeno vinaigrette - Hamachi Serrano - Kobe beef sashimi in ponzu sauce - Big eye tuna pizza, reminds me of Morimoto Waikiki - Oyster shooters with citrus sake.         If you are the type of Yelpers complain about the small portion, this is way out of your league, remember even a bowl of PHO is $15 here at a 5 diamonds resort and casino. You get what you pay for, this Yellowtail considers reasonable compare to other sushi spots on this strip! P.S. try the cucumber and ginger cocktails when you get a chance!",

Yes the drinks are expensive. Get over it, you're in the Bellagio  The menu is excellent, something for everyone and even adhering to the \"meat heads\" that Las Vegas attracts. Everything has a great deal of different flavors and textures going on all at once.   My server was Guy B, absolutely amazing. Very smooth and attentive to our every need and expectation! He gave us great recommendations and wasn't pushy! I highly recommend him to anyone who wants great service!   We were a table of two and ordered Tuna pizza, Lobster carpaccio, Alaskan King Crab Tempura, Rock shrimp hand roll, protein roll, and cup of chocolate, and Oolong tea!!  The lobster carpaccio was great! Nice and light! The king crab tempura was outstanding- nothing like i have had before in terms of SUBSTANTIAL King Crab. Rock shrimp roll was good, I would most likely try something different next time. The protein roll is a must!  Cup of chocolate was a great twist on a classic! Banana foam is a nice touch!  All is all, amazing meal, amazing service! So why the four stars instead of five? Well I was looking around and it seems that We got lucky with our waiter! Next to us, i was watching a waiter pour beer into a class(not tilted) and it completely over flowed on the table. The waiter seemed to just walk away before he could watch the inevitable happen. Also, it seems theres a lot of confusion with tables, many of the food runners were making mistakes around us involving table numbers. Either a lot of the runners don't know the table numbers or theres a lack of communication.  Last words: sushi rice was warm- GREAT hard to find warm sushi rice anywhere! They are good with allergies such as Celiac!",

Weird buser who kept making loud dramatic comments about how much water I was drinking. The server was a calm individual who never listened to what we would answer to his questions. Example, so\" you guys are here visiting Las Vegas?\" \"No we're local, we're just celebrating our anniversary\" \"do you know what you would like to drink?\"   The food: 1. The tuna pizza, pretty good. Bread to tuna was sad. But hey, it shows the chef knife skills to cut the fish that thin! 2. King crab tempera chopped and deep fried. Small portion but good flavor. 3. Salmon roll. Same as any roll at a sushi place. But they double the price.   Would I come again? Maybe for dessert and capachinos and sit on the patio. If your on the patio...it ain't worth spending your money here.",

Filled with pop rock candy that doesn't change the flavor of the roll much just adds to the sweetness of the crab & creates a unique popping sensation. The seafood dynamite is also wonderful. I could have licked the plate! Pretty much can't go wrong with whatever you order.",

    "text": "Okay, stopped in again last night (I know, I know, just can't get enough).  Have three additional dish recommendations in addition to those in the first review.  - Crispy Kalbi. This dish has a center of Korean short ribs and uses slaw, rather than rice, as the outer layer.  Yep, you read that right.  No need to grab your Grandmother's glasses; I said slaw.  Trust me (famous last words.)  ;-)  But really, trust me.  - Broiled Atlantic Black Cod.  OMG, and I mean OMG! Any attempt to describe the taste of this menu item will fall short.  The fish is firm, yet pulls apart easily and I would ask that this be the last item to be served during the meal.  A perfect punctuation mark to an experience that has been building in taste and texture.  The chopsticks were clicking as we attacked the dish like a school of Amazonian piranas.  I would replace the Filet Mignon Toban with one of the above.  - Rock Shrimp Hand Roll.  I would order this rather than the Baked Crab Hand Roll.  Both are good, but the Rock Shrimp Hand Roll takes it over the top.  Happy eating!",

The featured cocktails were extremely watered down. We had to get a extra shot of vodka(Tito's)for $13 to actually make it taste like a alcoholic drink. Shishito peppers and the rock shrimp tempura very mild. Typically they're supposed to have a little spice to it but this wasn't the case. The food was mediocre at best. Featured specialty drinks were horrible.",

    "text": "Such an awesome place to Eat. After taking the Tram from Mandalay Bay to Excalibur, Getting lost inside New York, New York for 15 Minutes and walking all the way back from there to our Hotel (Planet Hollywood). I decided to come here for a Late Night Bite, located deep inside the Bellagio lies Yellowtail: a Japanese Restaurant that serves killer Food, with waitresses dressed in Miniskirts (but mainly this is about the Food).  When I made the reservation I asked if I could have a Table overlooking the Bellagio fountains outside, but they said they were all taken (that was only negative thing about my Experience here, Other than that everything else was Spot-On) they were at least kind to put me close to the window (Close Enough).  The reason why I wanted to come here was because of one Dish: Tempura Alaskan King Crab recommended by Beau MacMillan (1st Season Co-Host of the Food Network show: Worst Cooks in America and 1 of 15 Challengers to defeat Bobby Flay on Iron Chef America) on The Best Thing I Ever Ate episode (With Chopsticks).   It came out and it was like layered like a Cake and When I went to take a Bite it was Awesome (The rich juicy Crab meat, the Crunch of the Tempura, you get Heat from the Serrano Chilies, Mildness from the Red onions, Smokiness from the Micro Cilantro, Earthiness from the Beets, some Crispness from the Shredded Nori and you get sweetness from the Ponzu sauce that they pour over just when its about to be served).To take the world's biggest and most expensive Crustacean and turn it into this is just Mind Blowing. I had that along with a bowl of Spicy Miso Soup and a tall glass of Blueberry-Infused Bonzai Bunny Sparkling Sake (Refreshing). Everything was Phenomenal The food, service, the people, I'll be sure to have another meal the next time that I'm in Vegas (Count on It)",

I wouldn't mind spending a few hours there.  Once they seat you, there is not a moment where you are not taken care of- their service is on point.  Now for the food... We had their tuna truffle pizza (worth it to come just for that), then their popcorn roll which is an experience all to itself (pop rocks are mixed into the roll and send your mouth on an exciting culinary adventure), the yellowtail jalapeno (melt in your mouth), oysters (I wish they had mignonette sauce but I loved them regardless), cooked jalapeno halibut (also un delice!!!).  Sushi is one of my favorite foods and when the flavor are so present as they are in the chefs dishes... It makes a world of difference :)",

    "text": "I really wanted to like Yellowtail, but it was such a disappointment.  My co-worker and I arrived to our party's reservation (of about ~12 people) late and ordered our entrees late, but that should mean that everyone else's entree orders should arrive on time, right?!?!  Wrong.  We had the Big Eye Tuna Pizza, Yellowtail Jalapeno, and Tempura Alaskan King Crab (which is supposedly highly praised by the Food Network).  I liked the tuna pizza, but mostly because I liked the truffle oil.  The yellowtail tasted odd to me but that could be that I'm not a fan of orange flavored things and it's sitting in a blood orange sauce.  Meh, I think it was just not for me.  I had high hopes for the crab tempura given our waiter's high praise for it, but it was lackluster and did not wow me at all.  Tasted exactly like what it sounds like.   :/  What's up with that Food Network?  I thought this was supposed to be good!  Given our lackluster appetizers, I was hoping our entrees would make up for it.  I had a taste of the High Steak Roll, Crispy Kalbi Roll, and Jidori Chicken and again... lackluster.  :c  I could only taste the A-1 sauce in my steak roll and mostly only mayo from the coleslaw on my kalbi roll.  The rolls were overly sauced making it hard to even taste anything else!  Luckily the chicken was not so bad, and actually quite tasty and tender.  Thank goodness. But despite the chicken, it didn't save this place from the mediocre food and long wait times!    Throughout dinner, everyone's food came out at various times so one or two people would get their food, while the other ten would sit there waiting.  And then another person gets their food 15 minutes later, while the other nine sit there waiting.  And then another one or two people would get their food 15 minutes later, while the other seven or eight people would sit there waiting... you get the idea.  By the time everyone's food came out and decided to order dessert, it took another half hour before it was brought out!  To the point, where we almost wanted to just call it quits and pay just to leave.  After having the dessert, it wasn't even worth the time we spent waiting... sigh.  It made the wait that much more terrible.  :c  This resulted in an 3.5+ hour, $$$$ mediocre dinner.  :c  Lots of thumbs down.  Waste of time and money if you ask me.",

    "text": "Let me first mention that I understand that this restaurant is a high grade Japanese restaurant on the strip, Chef Akira Back is a Michelin chef and lots of celebrities have dined at Yellowtail. Let me also add that I've been to many other high quality Japanese restaurants in Hawaii, Seattle, California (both NorCal & SoCal), England and of course Japan: Tokyo, Kyoto, Hakkone, etc., as well as lived in Japan for 3.5 years. My Dad and I had a really bad dining experience. (My family returns back to Las Vegas a few times each year b/c we own a home here and we also have relatives -- so we've been to a lot of the restaurants on the strip over the course of 15 years.) It was apparent that our waiter did not like us ()-- in fact she ended up leaving us and had someone else wait our table -- and our food took a long time to reach our table. (The time it took really annoyed my Dad.) Naturally, even the best restaurants have their off nights which leaves room for some error. What made the experience even worse was that when we spoke with the manager, it was quite evident to us that he didn't care: his arms were crossed and face looking down to avoid eye-contact, as he slowly edged us out of the restaurant -- very passive aggressive () -- to ensure that other customers would not hear us. In all my years of eating at upscale Japanese restaurants, I've never experienced this sort of treatment. Chef Akira is Japanese; however, the customer service is not --  Even outside of this cultural point, I think most people want to be heard if they feel like they're not getting what they paid for. At the restaurant's price point, this sort of treatment is not acceptable :-( Even if the manager didn't agree with us, there's a different way to handle such situations -- ",

    "text": "I had made reservations for my wife and me as I read about the opportunity to have fine Asian fare overlooking the Bellagio fountain.  We were shown to an ideal little patio table overlooking the fountain.  The evening weather was perfect., and were both in high spirits.  What could go wrong?  How about all the food and all the drink....  We started the evening with one of their $20 cocktails.  I'll let you decide whether or not that would be considered \"overpriced\".  Mine was OK, but my wife's choice had vodka, spicy pepper, and strawberry puree.  It was so sour, we had to call over the waiter, and ask if it was supposed to be so.  He said no, that the sweetness of the strawberry puree was supposed to compliment the spicy pepper flavor.  He returned it to the bartender who then made a better tasting one.  Well, it was a minor slip-up on a $20 drink, but stuff happens, right?  We had ordered a chef's tasting menu paired with various sake tastings.  Before we could even take two sips of our pre-dinner cocktails, the food runners from the kitchen started dropping plates of food in front of us like it was a race to get us through our dinner.  We ignored the food while we enjoyed the cocktails looking over the fountain and Las Vegas Boulevard.  We asked our waiter to slow it down.  Ultimately, we begged him to just stop completely.    The chef's tasting menu was supposed to be six courses and a dessert.  We made it through three of the courses before we told the waiter to just stop.  The chef was embarrassing himself.  Each course was worse than the last.  The first course was kind of a sashimi pizza.  It consisted of four minuscule, paper-thin pieces of fish on a communion wafer with truffle oil drizzled on top.  The waiter said it was their signature dish.  My wife tasted it, and said the communion wafer was burnt.  By, Jove, she was right.  They apparently over-toasted them, and all you could taste was oil on a burnt cracker.  Oh, OK, the drink was bad, and the first course was disappointing, but we had a great view.  It would certainly get better, right?  Wrong.  The second course was three paper-thin pieces of fish with some melted chocolate sauce and a splooge of sriracha right from the plastic bottle.  It tasted as awful as that sounds.  There was no flavor of fresh fish.  None.  Chocolate and sriracha  Blech.  The waiter was growing tired of hearing our concerns, and just then, another food runner showed up with Course #3: again, three paper thin pieces of fish covered in mustard and salt. What little taste was exactly like one of those German pretzels with mustard on it.  It was at this point, we had to flag him down and demand they stop the service.  Each course contained tinier and thinner pieces of fish than the last (if that could be possible).  There was no celebration of fresh fish, but a naked attempt to serve the smallest portions possible slathered with overpowering sauces dreamed up in some hellhole kitchen about to be eviscerated by Gordon Ramsay.    I have never, ever, in my life asked for the food to stop coming.  We felt horrible.  We had never had such a difficult restaurant experience.  My wife was nearly in tears.  The waiter said the manager removed all the food from our bill, and we were still served a bill north of $250 just for the drinks.  I tipped the waiter appropriately as he wasn't the chef, and I had to write off the experience as a very expensive seat to enjoy a couple drinks overlooking Bellagio's beautiful fountain.  The manager refused to visit our table.    Now before you or the restaurant manager simply write us off as East Coast rustics who wouldn't know fresh fish if it was a piranha that bit us on the cheek, let me provide a little context.  I am retired military and work internationally.  My wife is also a highly accomplished professional who travels globally for her work.  We have had the world's best sushi/sashimi at the Tokyo fish market.  I have eaten fugu in Japan (the potentially deadly blowfish).  We have sampled the raw fish in cities like Hong Kong, Seoul, Beijing, Macau, Luoyang,  San Francisco, Hawaii, and dozens more places.  Sushi is supposed to be all about the delicate flavor of the fresh fish.  The ridiculously transparent slices of fish and the nasty sauces made this the single most disgusting sushi meal we have ever eaten.    The.  Worst.  This was supposed to the the chef's tasting menu!  I would have preferred gas station sushi from a quicky-mart on a desert highway outside of Pahrump, NV.  The fish slicer at Yellowtail should be paraded in sackcloth and ashes down Las Vegas Boulevard on his way out of town for good.  I guess you could say we wouldn't recommend you waste your money here.",

We requested a table with a view and were taken to a table next to the window with the view of the Bellagio Fountain outside. Amazing!!!   Our server was wonderful. We didn't know much about sushi so he gave us some recommendations, all of which were great. We had a few rolls and a halibut sushi. Everything was delicious.

I had a reservation for 5 PM to assure plenty of time to eat and relax before the 7 PM show.  I was taken to a two top at the window overlooking the Bellagio fountains.  I looked at the menu and my server came and asked about water/other beverages and I ordered my standard iced tea which was quickly brought to the table.  I looked over the menu some more and the server gave me some recommendations.  I decided to order one cold shared plate and one warm shared plate as the server (and some reviews) point out that the shared plates aren't that large.  I got the Big eye tuna pizza and the tempura Alaskan king crab.  These were two recommendations from the server and he pointed out that the tempura crab had been on the Best Thing I Ever Ate Food Network show.  The tuna pizza was very good.  It had a very, very thin crust with just enough substance to pick up the pieces and eat it truly like a pizza.  The flavors were great even the truffle oil because it was used sparingly.  The tempura crab was a bit of a disappointment.  It was OK but the tempura was a bit heavy and took away from the crab. I couldn't help but think it was a waste of good crab making it tempura style.  It wouldn't go on my list of best thing I ever ate.  For dessert, I ordered the Chocolate in a cup.  It consisted of Nutella, banana foam, and vanilla bean ice cream.  The Nutella is in the cup and there's a ring on top of the foam that breaks and dissolves into the foam and ice cream.  It was a great dessert.  Service was impeccable.  The view of the fountains is always good.  During dinner, there were three fountain shows.  Prices are Strip prices but I knew this going in so it doesn't affect my rating.",

The staff was very professional and hospitable. We mentioned we had tickets for a show and they made sure the courses were being brought out in a timely manner.",

The roll definitely creates a unique sensation when you bite in to it and it just bursts with flavor. The pop rocks do not take away from the flavor of the roll at all. They enhance it. We also had the shrimp tempura and angry salmon rolls. I also really enjoyed the rock shrimp appetizer.",

The five of us (4 girls, 1 guy) got seated at a round table and were blown away by having a view of the fountains behind us. It was around 8:30pm on a Saturday and though the restaurant wasn't empty, it wasn't packed either.   We ordered a bunch of food to share as the plates were smaller and were happy with how everything tasted. We got the Duck Prosciutto, Gyoza (some of the best pot stickers I've had!), Uni Truffle Pasta with sea urchin, Seaweed Salad, and four rolls (Mile High was totally worth it!). Bill came out to be ~$50/each which was expected and worth it for a nice Vegas meal before going out. It was enough to fill us up and overall delicious too. Highly recommended for ambiance, fanciness, and quality of food!",

We made a reservation for 5 (we're parents and tired, so dinner is early) and we were seated right away, with a table with an amazing view of the Bellagio fountains. The ambiance is really nice and the music was really good.  Our server was fantastic although I don't remember his name. He clearly enjoys his job and was very helpful throughout experience. We were told to try their \"Greatest Hits\", in which our server ordered for us and guided us through our meal choices. We ended up getting the big eye tuna pizza, yellowtail jalapeno, the rock shrimp, and my husband got a roll with beef in it (crispy kalbi?) and I got a roll with tuna in it. Everything was delicious but the standout was the tuna pizza. It was on a thin, crispy flatbread and had some kind of spicy mayo on it and: truffle oil.   I definitely recommend Yellowtail, just be warned that it is quite expensive.",

Sitting outside is a $345 minimum purchase per people, however, getting an inside window seat is an optional with no minimum. The only reason I didn't rate this place a 5 is because of our waitress. She (Chastain I think her name was or some combo name) didn't ask how the food was, refill the wine and worst of all it was my wife's birthday and not one small desert or candle. She knew and failed to make her feel special. Overall great food.",

We got there on Friday around 5:30 and able to get a table outside. the bellagio fountain show was right in front of us it was such a beautiful day and the view was amazing. Our server I believe his name was Seth he was incredible, very knowledgeable on all of the wines and dishes he is awesome! This was my first experience with Sashimi, I love sushi rolls and never thought I would care for sashimi. I believe we had the halibut I could be wrong on this. We also had the yellowtail jalapeno, oysters all of these were amazingly good! We also got the big eye tuna pizza so delish! A real treat was the tempura king crab the sauce with it really complimented the crab. We also got the filet mignon that came out sizzling and it is finished on the table with a peppery sauce it. Last but not least we figured we needed a little carbs ;) so why not get a roll my Sister opted to get the protein roll and to our surprise it did not have rice it was filled with crab, and it was amazing! We kept debating on whether or not to get another because we were running short on time to make it to, \"O\". We came to a decision that we would go with another. Our server knew we were going to the show and we got our second serving fast.  The service was incredible not just Seth but everyone there! The food was amazing! By the way did I mention how amazing this restaurant is lol!",

We also order Cali Rolls, which were also good.  And a cucumber salad - a nice addition. The hubby ordered 10 pcs of sushi - Unagi, Salmon, Squid (super chewy) and Tuna.  He was all about it, I took a pass.  I had my fill of apps and was satisfied. I love Sapporo so I stuck with that, but Joe had the Cucumber Essence - which is made up of cucumber infused vodka and other light yummy mix ins that made for one deliciously refreshing drink.   It's expensive.  But we were ready for that - we were at the Bellagio, after all.  I would go back just for the tacos! This one faces the fountains with some outdoor seating.",

Next course hot grilled wallow with shiitake mushroom (awesomeness), Kobe beef with carrot and potato and see weed (awesome), sushi chefs selection was ok. And dessert was decent. Overall I would t recommend the tasting menu order off the menu. The sake flight was great",

    "text": "Huminahuminahuminayummmmmmmm. I had a wonderful meal here!  yellowtail serrano- so sadly I can't remember, but instead of the yellowtail, we got a different type of yellowtail that was butterier than regular yellowtail. Can a sushi expert help me out here??? Anyway, it was sitting in a blood orange sauce with little serrano peppers and micro cilantro. The presentation was beautiful and the dressings were subtle, not cutting into the glorious stand-alone flavor of the fish itself.  foie gras torchon - two slices of foie gras with a nicely sized scallop, and an oyster. break it down! - I would have liked to see the foie gras seared, but that's ok, that's ok, it was still a decadent heap of fatty goodness that dissolved on my tongue bite after bite. The oyster was perfectly cooked, which is to say, nearly not cooked on the inside. It was fresh and delicious, but I could lose the weird crunchy balls that had been sprinkled no the top. Nearly ruined it for me. And lastly the japanese oyster sitting in the middle off the plate was to die for. Meaty, fresh and not fish. It didn't taste horrendously like the sea. It was covered in watery, salty juices. It was just a clean, fat, oyster.  Toro and scallion roll - there's not much to say. They make this everywhere because it's a classic and it works. The fish was good, the rice was good, it was a solid roll, But not if you're looking for something special.  Uni sushi- Since this is synonymous with awesome, there is nothing more I can say.  And the Bellagio is such a beautiful and romantic place. You really can't ask for more for a lovely, romantic, dining experience.",

Service was average. I just enjoyed the people watching from my dinner seat.",

I know creating sushi takes time, but it was as if the chefs forgot to make enough rice and had to cook it first.  The cocktails are pretty good so probably the best option is to get some drinks and sit on the patio and watch the fountains. Avoid the food unless you have $ to blow and are too lazy to go to Sushi Samba.",

I hate rolls that fall apart when they hit the chopsticks. That's not the case here... every thing is fresh and tightly wrapped.  I also love that this restaurant isn't afraid to to take chances. You can go to hundreds of Japanese restaurants and see the same exact menu... but to see things like sushi made with pop rocks or big eye tuna pizza- that jumps off the page. I love the originality!  The pop rock sushi was fun. The taste of sushi was fresh and delicious and then the aftertaste of the pop rocks fizzing in your mouth made it even more enjoyable. The tuna was delectable as well. Fresh and plenty of flavor and surprisingly easy to chew. I had other sushi rolls like spicy tuna and eel and avocado but those two items were the most memorable.  Also worth noting is the view. If you are fortunate enough to get a view of the fountain it doesn't get any better than that.  As many have already mentioned, the only complaint are the prices. The portions aren't large so you have to order a lot and then you are stuck with a huge bill.",

The service was impeccable. The ambiance was elegant and trendy. The noise level was not too loud.  The menu is fresh, creative, and intriguing. My personal fav was the pop rocks sushi roll (sweet and savory were well-balanced here) and the Big Eye Tuna Pizza (what in the world is on here and how was it SO amazing?!). Other notable awesome dishes were Rock Shrimp and Tempura Alaskan King Crab.  Yellowtail will be my first stop when I return to the strip!",

I would expect a nice expensive restaurant to have decent glasses not a glass you would receive while gambling or something.      The tuna pizza was good but presentation rather boring.  We also ordered Kumamoto oysters which was about $32 for 6 and it was not anywhere near Asian inspired I felt like it was something I would have got at an Italian place.   Oysters and cocktail sauce is basically what we got.   We ordered the filet toban as well which smelled awesome but was nothing special.   The crispy kalbi roll was delicious but presentation was lacking!!!!    Now I don't mind spending money on my meal if the food and presentation and service was great but I wasn't really happy when I left.  The service was rushed and she didn't really listen to us, plus she kept telling us that was probably enough food in which was not and felt that she didn't have time for us.   Maybe she just wanted us to leave.  We were helped by another man who was dressed in a chef coat who was not the chef but was helping out he said and he was very personable and helpful more than our server was.  She kinda disappear towards the end.  I Have high expectations for a restaurant in Bellagio and was highly disappointed.  Food was ok...service lacking....and food presentation pretty plain.  Prices should be much lower for the quality of everything.    Even a sushi roll was between 20 and 30 which is fine is it's exceptional.  If you're looking for delicious Asian food Andreas at Wynn or chada Thai near China town is great and you get what you pay for!",

My husband wasn't a fan of the pizza, but he loved the other 2 items, and he's not a big sushi guy. The happa roll had a little kick in the sauce provided. The seaweed salad was mediocre, just like any other seaweed salad at any other sushi joint, save yourself $9 on that. We stuck to water, so can't comment on the beverages. Waitstaff was courteous, on point with checking on us and refilling our water, and helpful with the menu items as we were newbies. Over all a great experience, and I'd say worth the money.",

The sushi rolls were SMALL--way smaller than anything I've gotten here in Boston, but the sushi quality was surprisingly good.  Overall service was pretty slow, but that's kind of what you get in Vegas.

There is a long bar in front and the dining in the back which also includes out door dining that overlooks the Bellagio Fountains and the show they put on. The environment is chic, comfortable and the staff is very good.  The bar is very petty and they make a great drink something many sushi places don't do well. Here the drinks are strong, it could be because it's Vegas. The staff is knowledgeable.  The food is fantastic. Plates tend to be small but that works well as it lets you order many different things. Some stand outs from the shared plates for me are the Lobster Carpaccio and the Yellowtail Serrano amazingly light and citrusy but both with some spice to them. Both of these are cold plates and i could not get enough. We reordered these multiple times. The warm shared plates i enjoyed were the Black Code and Seafood Dynamite. Both were wonderfully balanced with many layers of flavor.  We ordered quite a bit of sushi and i am not sure now what all of it was. I had my standard Dragon Roll, Tempura Shrimp and then some of their specialty rolls. Fish was very fresh and the rolls were made well. All of it was good. I am not a dessert eater but the Chocolate in a Cup was excellent. Their Lava Cake is also good.",

I love it when dining out, I can tell others about an amazing dish that I had that I just had to rave about! In this case, Yellowtail offers a really neat sushi roll called \"the popping spicy crab\" that has pop rocks candy embedded inside!!! It totally rocked my taste buds! I felt like I was playing with my food. It was soo cool. Also, the \"big eye tuna pizza\" is a must order as well! Lychee martini was puree perfectly and it wasn't too strong.   I WOULD have given this place an extra star but I felt that the service was a tad lazy that night. I even ended up walking up to the hostess desk to ask for my bill and WATER! I usually ward people away from place that has poor service but the food here is so divine!!",

The soft shell crab was delicious and so was the yellowtail roll.         For a refreshing cocktail, try the Sunset.  It is made with grey goose, blood orange pure and yuzu.  For something sweet and bubbly, the sparkling infused blueberry sake is amazing.  This restaurant is just as good for large groups as it is for a small intimate dinner.  But if you would like to take advantage of its location overlooking the famous fountains on the eight acre lake, make sure to request a table by the window or even outside on the patio.",

    "text": "4 words: Big. eye. tuna. pizza.  Holy cow, this is a fabulous dish.  It is listed under the \"Shared Plates\" part of the menu but I can guarantee that on my next visit, I am getting one of those suckers all to myself.  Maybe two.  It is that delicious.  My husband had tried it before and was raving about it ever since, so I tried to manage my expectations, but he wasn't exaggerating, it is that good.  I am not even going to bother describing it, because no description would do it justice.  It is just a flavor explosion in your mouth.  Period.    I am quite serious about ordering two for myself next time.  One to start and one to finish my meal.  In between I will order the Uni Sushi again, and the addition of the quail egg, really put these 2 pieces of sea urchin sushi over the top.  The baked crab roll is also fabulous.  My husband and I shared it, and I may just have to get an order for myself next time because the crispy onions, spicy aioli, in the soy paper was fabulous.  I was literally \"mmmmm\"-ing after every bite.    We also ordered the Popping Spicy Crab just because it is such a unique dish that we had to try it at least once.  Not only was this meal a pleasure for the senses of taste, smell, and sight...it was quite an experience for the ears too.  When the dish was placed on our table, you could hear the pop rocks popping away.  It was actually quite tasty.  Who knew that the sweet and crunchy pop rocks would be a great compliment to the spicy crab? Chef Akira, obviously.    My husband's favorite seafood is scallops and so we had to order the Seared Diver Sea Scallops, and it was seared perfectly and accompanied by a mustard potato puree.  It wasn't my favorite, but my husband loved it.  Fine with me, because that just meant more room for another order of uni.  From start to finish, I had a smile on my face.  With a fantastic view of the Bellagio fountain show and a tall glass of Asahi Black, I was in heaven.    The service was impeccable.  I highly recommend that you ask to be seated in Roberto's section if you want amazing service.  I was quite pleasantly surprised with this meal.  For years, I have walked past this restaurant in the Bellagio, not giving it a second look.  But, from now on, I will be salivating every time as I imagine the big eye tuna pizza.  If they were open for lunch, I would be there right now.",

    "text": "We've eaten here many times and it doesn't disappoint.  Favs: Tuna Pizza (OMG), Rock Shrimp, popping crab roll, Edamame in the chili sauce, basically any special of the night.  The cocktail with cucumber was AWESOME!    3 complaints: Sake menu is pretty unfamiliar for most people, and the very nice girl who helped us by making recommendations only pointed out extremely expensive bottles, like $250+... ummmm... no.  So we felt like douches because despite everything she suggested, we chose an $80 bottle because that's more reasonable for us... to us, it's sake.  It's not Opus One.  Some people might disagree, but I just wish her suggestions were a bit more varied.   Secondly, the seating is too close together.  The tables where we were seated are all situated along a bench, and you sit THISCLOSE to strangers right next to you.  It makes for an uncomfortable dinner, because I didn't feel like I could talk to my husband freely without feeling like everyone was listening in to our conversation.  Lastly, when you order lots of small plates, I expect the server to stagger them so that you receive one or two, and then you get a break between.  This is the way our meals have always been at Yellowtail in the past.  This time, our table was suddenly loaded down with all 4 of our choices within maybe 10 minutes time (or likely less).  We felt very rushed and not relaxed at all.  That part sucked.  If the service had been a bit better and we hadn't been jammed in with strangers, this rating would be much higher.  The food itself and the atmosphere is amazing.",

    "text": "Our experience at this restaurant is the impetus  for writing my first review on yelp. My wife and I read the mixed reviews and decided to try it since we love sushi and unique dining experiences. I'd  have to say, this was one of the only vegas \"higher end\" meals that had left us disappointed, and sorry we didn't heed the warnings of those who had been disappointed  before us. We eat a LOT of sushi,  probably 6x or more a month. We tried two rolls (for a total of OVER $50) and were  completely  underwhelmed.  I've paid the same for similar sized rolls at sushi roku in Ceasars and didn't regret the price for a second because it was that good. Yellowtail? Meh.. ok flavor, pretty small size. Then we ordered  salmon sushi. My wife and I both laughed out loud when the order came. Others have scoffed at the size of the sushi pieces and we should have listened. I honestly can't even describe how small they were. I guess the best I could day is, take a standard \"pink eraser\" from when you were a kid in school, cut it in half, and that's the size of the order.  For $12. And, it was just ok.   Then we get to the service. We were in vegas on a Sunday night. It was dead. Walked right into this place and could have had a seat on the terrace on the fountains had we asked. That's how dead it was. The waiter was running around like he had never been busier, checked on us maybe once and in the midst of his \"rush\" failed to bring a BOWL OF RICE that we ordered for my son. We had two rolls and a salmon sushi delivered approximately 20+ minutes after we had ordered, ate them and then sat around waiting for him to come back. He looked shocked when he asked if we wanted anything  else and I asked if we could get the food we ordered in the first place before we moved on to anything else.   My wife and I eat out A LOT. It's a passion to try new things and explore new places. This place fell dead flat. Extremely disappointed  and thus, doubtful  we would ever return. Too many other great options out there. Not to mention much cheaper. It's unfortunate.  Great location and concept and beautiful decor.",

    "text": "I agree with the others, this place is overpriced! My eyeballs had the $$ in them as I scan the menu.   My mister and I had our dinner here on our very last night in Vegas. I choose this place because I saw the chef on the Bellagio info tv channel making the popular big eye tuna pizza dish. Just to clarify, this is not your cheese and tomato pie, but slices of tuna on a crisp tortilla bread and sliced onions with truffle oil sprinkled on top. That was $26! Yes, that was our appetizer and it was really delish and one of the most creative dishes that I've had in a long time. I ordered a Lychee martini - $20, for that drink.   The mister decided that we should go with the chef's seven course tasting menu. The last time we ate a chef's tasting menu anywhere was ages ago, so why not, the mister was treating the Mrs. Here is the breakdown of the chef Akira Back menu:   1. Seafood Pate with a tiny, delish sugary treat (I didn't like this)  2. Sliced Yellowtail with jalapenos  3. Salad with greens, tomato, & onions  4. Salmon with miso sauce and foam  5. Kobe short ribs with a quail egg and star shaped veggies  6. 5 pieces of sushi (sushi was average)  7. Green tea mousse cake with a shot of milk.   Portions are small so this tasting menu made our stomach at that beginning feeling at full. Believe me, there will be no leftovers to wrap up and I made sure that I drank very sip of my lychee martini. Overall, I loved my experience at Yellowtail. The waiter was awesome as he made sure we done on time as we had to leave for our show. The ambiance is beautiful, so chic, and very romantic. This restaurant has a beautiful view of the fountain show. I would come back just for the tuna pizza and ambiance. As for the prices, you will be spending part of the jackpot you've won OR considered what you've paid to eat here as a part of your gambling losses.",

You might want to shy away from sushi with, wait for it...pop rocks in the \"popping spicy crab\" roll, but don't be scared! It comes out popping loud enough for you to hear.

    "text": "I can honestly say that eating here was one of my favorite experiences of my most recent Vegas trip.    If you're gonna eat here, do it right.  Get a table outside on the Terrace.  There is no better view in Vegas of those Bellagio fountains and the strip in general.  It's relaxing, it's beautiful, it's romantic, just great.    The service is as friendly as you can find.  Our waiter was constantly checking on us and making recommendations.    We started with the garden salad which was good but the dressing was a little saltier than I expected, I think I was just prepared for something sweeter based on the smell.  I love that they bring you two different types of edamame.  The original style with salt, and a spicy/sweet marinated type.  Both were great.  The sushi was very fresh... I only wish i would have had room to try their amazing sounding current specials.. I assumed I wouldn't get full so fast!  The drinks are soo tasty... and at $20 a piece, they better be! The essence is by far the best.  If you're outside in that vegas heat, the essence is the perfect drink to cool you down.",

Expect to try something completely out of the ordinary here - this is sushi with a twist.  After being seated promptly by a lovely hostess (we were a little late but it didn't matter to them) we were shown our table right by the window which overlooked the Bellagio fountains. I'd heard about Yellowtail's sparkling blueberry sake before hand and it was gorgeous, a definate must try.  For starters we ordered the Tuna pizza which is pretty much what it says on the tin. It was good, unusual, tasty. We then went for Akira's \"Shooter\" which was an oyster, blueberry sake and wasabi served in a shotg glass. This was too cool, not for the brave, but we like a culinary adventure and so we ordered seconds!!  After quite a few appetizers we had a small selection of sushi including the strawberry roll which was amazing - totally unique and beautiful.  The setting and tone for this restaurant are amazing, that complemented by it's fabulous food and great service make for a beautiful meal. Expect to pay a little more but for us it was well worth it.",

The only problem here is the hostess stand. They do not effectively manage arrivals. Reservations get seated simultaneously to walk-ins. In the time it takes to look up your reservation, two other parties are taken outside for the fountain view. Given the highly limited amount of seating outside, this can be frustrating.  Overall, if you're a sushi person, I highly recommend the experience; get there early for a good seat, the balcony is full within half an hour of opening.",

    "text": "One of the best places to munch, if you're staying at the Bellagio. I've ordered several dishes as a snack, not necessarily as my dinner. They were fulfilling as my afternoon snack, and they also tasted good. It was a win win!  I had the hamachi jalapeno, which is one of my favorites. Their sashimi meat wasn't as thick as others, but the jalapeno (obviously) was spicy enough. I might've enjoyed better with a side of sushi rice, but since I wasn't hungry, I had it just as is. I also had a few other of their amazing meals. 1 was their popular ahi tuna pizza. I may not have been a big fan, but my dining mate loved the dish.   My favorite was popping spicy crab roll. There was a surprise hint of Pop Rocks, which I did not expect. It was very refreshing but also a good surprise to the dish. I'm surprised this place only has 3.5 stars! Beware, it is pricey, but if you're at Bellagio, what else do you expect? If you walk in knowing that it's not going to be a cheap bite, you'll have much of a better experience. I had a great time. Plus, free Shogun Shot with Yelp check in! Go get their yummy drinks & food!",

    "text": "Terrible service!  Before I continue talking about the horrible service, I want to give my compliments to the chef.  The food was delicious and it would have been an even better experience if we received the A5 wagyu that we had ordered.  More on that later.  Now I want to focus on the horrible service my family and I received starting from the beginning when we arrived.  Negative #1:  Immediately the hostess tells us that we have to place our child's stroller in the manager's office because they have no place for it at our table.  Ummm...we were seated at a table that had a spot big enough for me to lie down and stretch out.  So there was more than enough room for our stroller.  What really upset me is when I saw someone leaving the dining area WITH THEIR CHILD'S STROLLER!  IF YOU ARE GOING TO APPLY A POLICY...APPLY TO ALL!    Negative #2:  Our waitress was the worst!  It took her almost 10 minutes from the time she said Hello to us to the time she took our order.    Negative #3:  We had to flag our waitress numerous times to ask her where our appetizers and dinner items were.  I get that it was a busy time at 630pm.  So, you would think she would at least keep us updated from time to time instead of us having to ask often.  There were literally dead times (several times) between the delivery of our different dinner items as long as 10 minutes each!    Negative #4:  At the beginning when we placed our order, we asked for miso soup, but we never got it until we inquired about it which was at least 1 hour after we arrived!    Negative #5:  WE NEVER GOT THE A5 WAGYU THAT WE WERE LOOKING FORWARD FOR OUR PARENTS TO HAVE EVEN THOUGH WE KEPT ASKING WHEN IT WOULD ARRIVE.  THAT WAS THE MAIN POINT OF US GOING OVER TO THIS RESTAURANT.    Negative #6: THE MANAGER CAME OVER TO ME AND TOLD ME THAT A RUNNER HAD DELIVERED THE WAGYU.   I SAID, \"NO, WE NEVER RECEIVED IT\".  HE KEPT INSISTING IT WAS DELIVERED AND THEN HAD THE AUDACITY TO ASK IF WE REMEMBER IF WE RECEIVED IT.  HELLO!!!  I SAID WE NEVER RECEIVED IT!  WHO CAN FORGET ABOUT EATING 8 OZ. OF WAGYU THAT WOULD HAVE COSTED $400!!!  HOW DARE HE ASK ME THIS...INSULTING MY MEMORY!  Suggestion to this restaurant...DO NOT QUESTION THE CUSTOMER ESPECIALLY IF THEY ALREADY SAID THEY DIDN'T RECEIVE IT AND  ESPECIALLY IF THEY HAVE BEEN ASKING TO RECEIVE THE ITEM NUMEROUS TIMES!  QUESTION YOUR EMPLOYEES AND THEIR POOR SERVICE!  MAYBE THEY ATE IT?  WE SURE DIDN'T!    Negative #7:  When I made our reservation, I mentioned that it was our parents' 51st anniversary.  At every restaurant that I have been too, when they knew we were celebrating an occasion, they would have some type of dessert.  You would think being at a high end restaurant at the Bellagio, you would receive the same treatment if not more...especially since our bill was $700 without the wagyu.  All my parents received at the end was someone greeting them \"Happy Anniversary\".  Wow...that's it?    Negative #8:  We had to flag someone for our check because once again our waitress was nowhere in sight.  When we received our bill, we paid for it and didn't give a tip to her due to her horrible service and due to the manager questioning us.  Instead, we tipped the guy $100 who paid attention to us over 15 times giving us water and clearing our plates because he did what we expected him to do at this high end establishment...he did his job!    Negative #9:  This one takes the cake... the  waitress who gave us horrible slow service finally ran so quickly to us outside the restaurant...not to finally give us good service...but to ask for her tip saying that they DIDN'T charge us the tip. I said, \"I know.  We gave our tip to the guy who gave us excellent service, but we didn't give you a tip because you were so slow to service us and we had to keep flagging you down\".    WORD OF ADVICE TO ALL THE WAITERS AND WAITRESSES OUT THERE:  A TIP IS EXTRA MONEY ASIDE FROM YOUR WAGE WHICH IS BASED ON SERVICE.  IF YOU WANT A TIP, THEN GIVE AT LEAST GOOD SERVICE, IF U WANT A BETTER TIP, THEN GIVE EXCELLENT SERVICE, IF YOU WANT AN AWESOME TIP, THEN GIVE OUTSTANDING SERVICE.",

I have never had any trouble with the time of serving, almost on the other hand sometimes the food come out so fast you have to wait in between ordering your dishes. We try to venture out testing new things every time, at this last visit we had the Big Eye Tuna Pizza which I will tell you... I will have to order at every visit I will make as long as it's on the menu. So delicious! We did not get the rock shrimp this time and when i walked out and saw it on someone else table I did kinda miss that dish, it is so very good. Other than that we had really good roles The baked Crab Hand roll was my favorite.  I have tried many times to get one of the tables by the window but only succeeded once. By the windows you have a truly beautiful view of the water fountains and their dancing spectacle.   I will be back soon for sure!",

We were also looking for a place to watch the World Series. This all worked out perfectly for us. We got there without a reservation and were able to snag a seat right by the TV so we could eat and watch the World Series at the same time. We had a lovely server who was very attentive the whole time. Our hostess was so sweet as well. While we waited for them to clean the table we were about to sit at, she recommended her favorites and the most popular items on the menu. She said you need to get the tuna pizza. We did and it was delicious. If you choose to dine here you must start off with that as an appetizer. We got a seaweed salad, a few rolls, and rock shrimp. Everything was delicious and it came out super fast. We also enjoyed a cocktail while we watched the World Series. It's a fine environment with great service. Of course it's pricey because it's fine dining in Las Vegas. Overall, I would come back here. We both had stomach aches later that night, we think it might've been because of the heavy sauce used on the rock shrimp. If you are a victim of having a weak stomach, I wouldn't recommend ordering that. Otherwise, this place is great and I would definitely go back.",

The fried tofu was excellent (bartender recommended) it was light and crispy in a sweet and spicy sauce. The real standouts were the protein roll and the crispy kalbi roll. The protein was a roll with no rice and several pieces of fish rolled around crabmeat. Really good! The kalbi roll was insane though. Crispy Korean short ribs rolled in rice and a sweet Korean BBQ sauce,topped with coleslaw! Yes really coleslaw! See my picture... This is a must try.  The foie Gras was good not stellar but it's hard to have bad foie Gras! Thought it was overpriced at 43 dollars for a small piece.   I know it's Vegas but 16 dollar beer (hitachino white) and 43 dollar foie Gras was a bit excessive, that's why I took off 1 star. Service was good, bartender made several suggestions and was very nice.",

We actually finished early and arrived at 8:30pm.  When we checked in, the hostess was able to seat us. Score!  Our server was super nice and knowledgeable.  He recommended dishes and answered every question we had about the dishes. He also took his time- so even though the restaurant was busy, he didn't rush us.  What we ordered: - Big Eye Tuna Pizza - this is one that the server recommended and oh-mah-gawd.  It was SO good.  The whole dish was light but filling.  The truffle and shiso complemented the tuna and crispy rice thing on the bottom.  YUM. - Salmon sushi - fresh and delicious.  I got several orders of this.  LOL - Ikura - my favorite ikura is from SugarFISH so I always compare ikura to theirs.  This was pretty close.  =) - Yellowtail Scallion Roll - I figured since I was at Yellowtail, I should order something with Yellowtail.  The roll was good- nothing special.  We just drank soda since we were buzzed playing at the tables. Total came out to $120 after tax and tip!  Not bad!  After our dinner, our server told us we should go out to the balcony to watch the Bellagio water show.  It was nice to see the show from a different point of view (usually it's from the street), but I felt weird standing in the corner amongst the other patrons enjoying their dinner.  LOL.  I definitely would come back (at least for that tuna pizza thing).",

The sushi is definitely one of the worst for this type of establishment. I get Vegas prices - we've eaten at a number of upscale sushi restaurant on the strip. But the prices Yellowtail charges for its mediocre sushi nigiri and sushi rolls is downright rip off. Nothing special when it comes to food options and sushi rolls. Plain. Boring. Need major overhaul on food and service to meet the expectations of Bellagio guests who wish to eat at the same hotel they are staying at.",

We had a table near the window but it was too windy for the watershow that day. We arrived a bit early for our reservation so we waited in the bar until our table was ready. Soon after we ordered our drinks, the hostess came by to seat us.  I was happy to see that they had a selection of Japanese beers, which you don't see much around. I ordered the Hitachino White Ale. Great beer, very clean and refreshing.  We ordered a bunch of appetizers to share with the table. We started off dinner with a their signature dish, Big Eye Tuna Pizza. This is thinly sliced tuna on top of a very thin crunchy piece of flatbread (similar to a wonton chip). Next we had the Lobster Carpaccio. This was probably the best dish of the night. Thinly sliced pieces of lobster in a ponzu sauce. This is a must order. A good hot appetizer was the Tempura Alaskan King Crab. Bite sized pieces of Alaskan King crab deep fried in a tempura batter. We then ordered various pieces of nigri sushi for the table. The fish was definitely fresh.",

I promise you won't be disappointed.  The sake is also really tasty.  And if you want to eat with a view of the fountains...that is available too.  Plus, we eat here every year without a reservation.  This place is a hidden gem right in the open.  The only downside is the price.

It was NOT busy at all and she took 15 minutes to refill waters after we asked, and we had to ask for our bill twice and then get up and ask at the hostess stand for it. Ridiculous.  I got the tuna pizza based on her recommendation since she said it's what they were known for. It was delicious. My bf's chicken meal was crazy good too and he loved it. It's too bad that our meal was tainted by her horrible service. Also, they don't give free refills, so she ended up charging us almost $10 for his 3 sodas. Really?",

The hostesses, the furniture, the lighting, the tulip on your table and then the stunning Bellagio fountains!   Let's begin with the food items which are the whimsical sushi rolls. We ordered a baked crab roll which was very delicate yet filling and the popping spicy crab roll which happened to be the highlight of the evening. This roll had actual pop rocks in it and was so much fun to eat! Note to all sushi places, start using pop rocks! I loved the sweetness from it and it all came together so well.  Next we had the Kobe beef flat iron which came with baby root vegetables & potato puree. On the side you receive warm teriyaki glaze and it was smooth & sweet. This dish was good but nothing special. Ordered a side of mushrooms that were great!   We also had a few cocktails, one was the sunset that contained grey goose l'orange, blood orange puree and yuzu (nothing special) and then the Infusion which contained pineapple & vanilla infused \"early bloom\" sake and Bacardi light rum (loved this one) the drink presentations were beautiful with very feminine touches like an orchid and an orange twist.  Everything here looks really good and service was on it. When we arrived the place was empty and as we left it was packed.   Grab a seat near the windows for the views of the fountains! This part is the cherry on top of this experience.",

Candy and sushi together was a very cool combo. We also had the rock shrimp which was delicious.

    "text": "\"Home of the three dollar tip.\"  If I'm paying Vegas prices, I want there to be \"no limit\" to the hours something is served. So, if I want sushi in a restaurant that is located in the lobby of the Bellagio, it should be served all night, not until eleven PM. 11 PM?! Really? Because I'm not a Vegas local I'm most likely just getting out of a show then, or maybe 1/4 of the way into my night. Serve sushi all night...it's a good business model.  However, if you do serve sushi, don't put white onion in it. It's totally gross. Maybe the chef was playing a joke on us.  Dinner for two: $80 including a horrible plate of mushrooms and \"sauce\" that tasted like something from my high school cafeteria; that weird \"onion roll,\" and something tempura'd, which can never go wrong.   Also, the server insisted on reaching our table by maneuvering through a tiny gap between my left shoulder and the wall. It was like someone was sneaking up on my, only they were bringing me my chopsticks.   I'm sure this is a fun place to have a drink (we weren't given a drink menu) but our vodka tonics were watered down.   Eh, you get what you get when you go for convenience in Vegas.",

(They gave us a great table, and we are not in the NBA).  When I say the place was hip, I mean it might be a little too hip. The team of waiters (young, cool, and attractive) were always passing by and were perhaps a bit too present if you know what I mean. Certainly nice, certainly attentive, but also often interrupting us to ask us what we needed. This might just be a function of the place being new (and I admit that it's certainly better than being ignored!) but it was noticeable.  Some of the food we had was incredible: the Kobe beef carpaccio and the lobster carpaccio get five stars. The sushi, on the other hand, while good, was nothing to write home about. I felt like it was about the same as the good sushi I can get here at home, and it didn't compare to the sushi I had at Shibuya in MGM Grand.  That said, Yellowtail is a solid 4 stars, and I would go here again if I wanted to see and be seen while enjoying the good food.",

The sushi was solid: fresh and creatively prepared, and we had some really good kobe beef (although the ladyfriend says the beef would have been better without the sauce and she cautions you to stay away from the banana roll).  One thing: the wine list was an absolute embarrassment.  We saw a bottle of Yellowtail (the name of the restaurant but also the crappy Australian wine you can buy at our corner Ghetto Mart for $7) for $48!  Using that as our baseline, and knowing next to nothing about wine, we ordered a bottle of $70 wine thinking it would be at least decent, and it wasn't.

We had a large party, and I do understand if certain mistakes are made during busy hours.  However, they weren't super crowded.  Took a while for everything to come out.  What I really disliked the most was the waiter dropping off everything at certain spots of the table.  If you're a fancy sushi restaurant, wouldn't you at least know or remember who ordered which food and where it went? Also, there was clearly timing issues, and dishes came out one or two at a time.  For a large party, some people had to watch others eat.  It just amazed me how they dropped off the food, and since we were a large party, it took a while to determine who had ordered it.... And the waiter was pretty clueless also! The food itself was pricy, yet it was decent. The edamame was good, as it was well seasoned.  Besides that, definitely not worth it.  I would only go here again if I was forced to... If not, definitely visit other sushi places on the strip!!",

I couldnt tell if the fish was any good or not because there was barely any in the rolls.  The nigiri was average.  The price is about 3 times more than normal but the quality is at or below average.  The special cocktails are $20 and barely have alcohol in them.  im willing to pay good money for a good quality meal but this place was just money down the drain",

    "text": "Let me just say I think I am being more than generous by giving it one star. This was the WORST, absolute WORST, and for those of you who are just skimming and may have missed it... THE WORST PLACE EVER! Overpriced Garbage!  I made reservations at Yellowtail for my husband's birthday. He loves sushi and could eat it for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Even though we had reservations, we still had to wait 20 minutes to be seated and the place was not that busy. No big deal there...it happens...sometimes you have to wait.  Then there was the food. Becca F. was right in her review...\"sushi chefs everywhere are embarrassed\". We order the 7 course chef's tasting menu. After each course I was hoping and praying it would get better. I kept thinking...How could it get any worse? I was wrong every single time. Then we finally got to the dessert and it was bad! How do you screw up dessert?  Even the service left lots to be desired. Since we had 7 courses we often watched our next courses take a couple laps around the restaurant before it made it to our table. A few waiters that didn't know their table numbers I suppose. No big deal, until the ice cream was practically completely melted on the dessert by the time it came to our table.  The ONLY thing that was good about this meal was the Sapporo and we all know Yellowtail had nothing to do with that. I have been reading a lot of the other reviews on this sight and I wish I would have read them before I went.  Here's the kicker for those of you that are still reading...After dropping almost $400 on this crappy birthday dinner we went directly from the restaurant to Taco Bell. My husband didn't eat any Taco Bell because he was full from eating my meal and his meal at the restaurant because he didn't want to waste it at those prices. Now the next morning, as I type this review, my husband is having a hard time trying to decide which end to put on the toilet first because he has FOOD POISONING!!!",

    "text": "Overpriced for the Sushi it delivers.  Saki list?  $33 and most bottles were over $70.  I started wondering if the Saki just might be worth it, I was ready to blow some dough on a good meal and hot saki, when I looked at their \"premium wine\" selling for $41 a bottle, knowing of course that it sold for $5.99 at the local grocery store.    The sushi list was little to be desired (and high priced) rolls were simplistic and not well thought out, Sashimi (at $11) was less then very small 3 slices, not even enough as an appetizer.  This place was so dissapointing I had to apoligize to my friends several times for picking it.   We filled up on popcorn at the 'O' show, instead of having the nice Sushi dinner we thought we would have.  I looked around at the restaurant, nobody had a caraff of Saki, or bottle of wine, or table filled with food...because...you go here, for the ambience not the food.  I was highly disappointed!  We ate at SUSHI MON off the strip the night before and it was well worth the price (if under priced) and DELISH!  Yellowtail?  Come on get a life!  I wish Hells Kitchn guy would visit you and give you a talking to.  I am embarrased that I didn't walk out!  Of course, this is fish in Las Vegas,,,I bet you feel entitled to your little dishes and ridiculous prices.    I'll stay in Santa Cruz and eat the best Sushi...and watch your business fail from afar.  YES that IS how pissed off that I wasted time in your establishment!",

    "text": "One star for the nice bartender who took care of me tonight.  Other yelpers had a problem with service, but I didn't.  I had a problem with the food.  When sushi is this expensive, you expect it to be really good.  I ordered Ikura, Japanese scallop and yellowtail sushi.   Each piece was very smail, which to be fair is more traditional, but when you consider that each order was $9.00-$11.00 or $12 you kind of want a teeny bit more substance.  If not substance, then at least some kind of special preparation.  Small portiions are even forgivable if the fish is to die for.  The yellowtail had virtually no flavor - weird, right?.  Even bad yellowtail tastes like, well bad yellowtail.  This was just void of anything.  The scallops were wet and mushy and the Ikura was just okay - kind of fishy - even for salmon eggs (which I love and order all the time)..  I also ordered the eggplant on skewers.  This was so-so..  They cut the eggplant into small cubes, skewered them, supposedly grilled them, then slopped it with the sweet sauce that you usually see on eel sushi...a.totally forgetable dish.  But the worst offender of the evening was one of Yellowtail's 'signature' cut rolls: spicy crab, asparagus, green bean  and (are you ready?) pop rocks.  This is HAD to try just for the goof.  But before diving in, I asked the nice barternder/server if this roll had mayo in it because I'm not a fan.  She said that they could make it without,.  It arrives and looks like your basic california roll.  When I tasted it, it wasn't spicy and the pop rocks just don't work.  In fact, it was ridiculous...like the chef was high out of his mind one night and said hey! let's stick some candy in a sushi roll and see how many suckers out there will pay $16.00 for it!!    Dinner with one non-alcoholic beer cost $79,00.  Granted, I'm at Bellagio so this should be expected - and I'm happy to pay for something that is worth the money.  But this was a waste of money, calories and time.  Don't go here.   This hotel has so many great places to eat.  Don't squander one of your meals here.",

We assumed he would suggest somewhere within the hotel, but with our luck he sent us to Yellowtail restaurant at the Bellagio. Yummmmmmm, in everyway imaginable! This guy found exactly what we were looking for. A beautiful restaurant filled with beautiful people. It was the perfect place to begin our night. We shared an array of exquisitely decorated and flavorful seafood dishes that included Chef's favorites Kobe Beef Tataki and Tai Sashimi. Our server was very knowledgeable of the menu and incorporated our favorite ingredients from our first cocktails through dessert. This restaurant has it all figured out. My next visit to Vegas will certainly include another great night of dinning at Yellowtail.",

I have eaten at a lot of of good sushi places in Vegas and elsewhere in the world and went i went to Yellowtail, i figured this was going to be amazing as it is in the Bellagio..Firstly, way over priced for the quality and selection. Second, the selection was terrible. When you only see a selection of 12 rolls, you would think that these 12 rolls are probably really good specialty rolls super rolls, nice and big... Not.. They were regular rolls. A regular tuna roll which is $5.00 anywhere you go (tuna, rice wrapped in seaweed), at yellowtail, it was $16.00..I will admit the salmon Sashimi and the salmon sushi was delicious. 4 ppl, did not eat much as all, $450.00...We actually left Yellowtail so disappointed and hungry and went for another dinner. The second place was better for a fraction of the price. Went to RA in the fashion mall. Now this place isnt the best, but we had a much better meal, we ordered more food than we did at Yellowtail and the check was $100.00...I never take the time to write reviews, but this yellowtail was so disappointing and overpriced that i had to write a review..PPl, stay away.........Now i see a lot of people giving this place 4 & 5 stars...Fake..Fake ratings...PPL in Vegas are being paid to write up bogus reviews in behalf of this place..There is no way this place should ever get 5 stars..They only thing that gets 5 stars for this place is the decor..IT is really nice..But they are charging you for it..NO thanks...Yellowtail get Yellowfail...If there was a a seventh dollar sign, i would pick it..$14.00 for 2 pieces of sushi or sashimi...That is $7.00 per piece..Terrible..",

    "text": "Yellowtail is hands down one of the best dinning experiences on the strip. In a city that probably has some of the best chefs in the world yellowtail at bellagio is a stand out. I recently dined there Tuesday and already can't wait to go back. As a Las Vegas local it's tuff to get me down to the strip for dinner. I'm very glad me and two friends made the journey. The food is simply amazing. Started with the big eye tuna pizza. This is a must when you visit.  Roberto, our server recommended this a starter. Fresh tuna, truffle oil and micro shiso. It's life changing. After that we just let Roberto take the reins and order for us, he did not disappoint. Every dish was amazing. The service is top notch our server made the experience unforgettable. The entire staff made us feel welcome from the front door all the way to the check. At one point the general manager even stopped by to say hello and ensure the had everything we needed. In closing, I can't say enough good things about this restaurant. Whether you are a Las Vegas tourists on vacation or Las Vegas local yellowtail is an absolute must visit.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying that if I could give no stars, I would after the \"customer service\" experience we had.    If you read any part of this review, read this:    GROUP FOOD POISONING AND HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE.  I had been planning a really special bachelorette weekend for my best friend of 22 yrs for months and of course I wanted every bit of it to be just perfect as a wedding is a once-in-a-lifetime experience and arguably the most important time in a woman's life.  We flew into Vegas from NYC on July 18, 2013 and wanted to have a big dinner and rest our first night before celebrating the following 3 days.    I chose Yellowtail as the Bellagio would be a change of scenery (we stayed at the Cosmopolitan which by the way is AMAZING), and because it is a 5-Star property at which one would THINK they would be dining in a trustworthy, luxury place.  We ordered many dishes to share including tuna pizza, different sushi rolls, eggplant, shrimp tempura, beef and more.    There were 6 of us in our party.  One of the girls  is vegetarian, so of course she did not partake in any of the seafood dishes.  Nor did I, as I don't eat fish. A 7th girl joined us in Vegas the following day, so she did not dine at Yellowtail.   THIS IS THE ONLY THING WE DID DIFFERENTLY FROM EACH OTHER THE ENTIRE FIRST DAY OF OUR TRIP which is how we know that the food poisoning came directly from Yellowtail.  The next morning, all 4 girls INCLUDING THE BRIDE, who ate the fish & sushi came down with debilitating food poisoning symptoms.  Vomiting and other issues that I'm sure I don't need to spell out, kept them literally lying on the hotel bathroom floor for the remainder of our trip. The poor things were hardly able to stand and we were thankful that we had a suite with multiple bathrooms or we would have been in an even worse state.  Our trip, and more importantly, the Bride's special weekend (and more--this food poisoning spell triggered her to experience vertigo which she is still suffering from to this day), were COMPLETELY RUINED.  The girls spent all day and night feeling like they literally might die, and the 3 of us who did not experience the symptoms , were force feeding them Gatorade and toast so that they wouldn't be hospitalized in Las Vegas with dehydration.  7 girls, 7 RUINED trips.   We couldn't do any of the fun things we had planned and wasted a lot of money and time that we will never be able to get back.  We called the Bellagio right away to put in a complaint thinking that they would AT THE VERY LEAST, refund our dinner bill as a courtesy for our extreme inconvenience.    Instead, they proceeded to give us the run-around for weeks, passing us off from department to department--Security to \"Guest Services,\" to the restaurant itself, to the Light Group (who owns the restaurant), etc., and ultimately we were told that they would not be taking ANY responsibility and that we were basically sh*t out of luck.   DO NOT EAT HERE.  Vegas has so many amazing and accommodating places to dine, and so many fun things to experience. Don't ruin your trip by eating at this irresponsible establishment.",

The dragonfire cocktail is very delicious- it's a sweet and spicy- I requested it with tequila, but be warned- the drink is $20.  Other recommendations are: uni sushi, seaweed salad, red dragon roll, and the oysters.  I tried the protein roll, but didn't really enjoy it. I guess I need the rice.   Again, order the tuna pizza!  After your meal, I recommend walking out to see the fountains. It was an amazing experience. It seemed like the water was going to hit us.",

I tried a few of the cocktails not exactly sure what the names were but had a cucumber essence, something with blood orange in it, a lychee one and the konpai?  The Cucumber Essence one smelled strongly of just cucumber. It wasn't sweet like some other cucumer drinks I've had in the past. It smelled like straight cucumber and alcohol. It was meh. The one with the blood orange was great! I loved it. It was sweet but not overly sugary. The lychee one was a little sweeter than the blood orange. Both great. The Konpai was really tart.  They had several dishes brought out for us to try. We had the big eye tuna pizza which was really good but small. Had a few sushi rolls that were ok.   I did NOT like the Ginger Creme Brulee.  All in all, it was a good spot. Pricey for the portions but I would def recommend to try it.",

The server explained that the chef's mother used to put candy in his rolls to get him to eat them and that's how he developed the concept.   The angry salmon roll ($16) was also quite good.  Just the right amount of spice. The sashimi was also excellent.  We tried the yellowtail serrano ($23) and the Shikoku octopus ($23).  There are some Korean influences, such as onion and corn in the seafood dynamite ($23).  I never really liked dynamite anything - covering perfectly good food in mayo or cream cheese is just not my thing.  They have a great Woollaston Estates Sauvignon Blanc by the glass ($12).  A 20oz bottle of Kirin was $12.  The service was impeccable.  Nice view of the fountains from the back dining room, but you can see those from the strip for free. Also a nice view of the casino and the crazy tourists from the front, which is much more interesting. I recommend checking this place out.",

Hands down cooked to perfection.  Great service too and again, great atmosphere.    Just to sum it all up... you're paying for the name and the atmosphere.

Wowowowoow it was delicious. Do not come here and skip this item. We then had some tuna and yellowtail sashimi.  The fish is always so fresh and such high quality. We had a couple specialty rolls as well, was a little hesitant on the crispy kalbi but boy did it deliver. The coleslaw on top finished it off perfectly. We had the Happa roll as well. Mmm mmm mmm.

The only downside is that it is very overpriced for the amount of food you get, but that is somewhat expected if you are going to dine at one of the nicer hotels on the strip.

If your looking for a hybrid type of food this place is just ok.   Tuna pizza - this was the highlight of the dinner. Thinly sliced tuna on a fried tortilla with a few greens on top and a slash of truffle oil. It is tasty and you can really taste the truffle oil.  Miso Cod - basically it is butterfish. This as always a winner. It is served with a sake foam that actually does add something to the dish. It also comes with a pickled cauliflower to tasted like a red plum.   Sushi - here is when things go all wrong. The sushi was cut thin and a small piece. Even tough the fish is fresh, you can't taste it because their is not enough of it. It reminded me of buffet sushi. I take that back. Buffet sushi in some ways is better than what we were served.   A Japanese Resturant doing sushi at that price point   needs to do it well. I'll say it again. Disappointing.",

We were a large group of 20 meeting up for a joint bachelor/ette dinner after a weekend of solo partying. The girls were staying in the bellagio but the guys were not so of course there were a few people who were late (within 10 minutes) arrivals. The manager was overly concerned with these people not being present even though we had a prix fixe menu already outlaid, and orders at the ready. Eventually he let us sit but as people filed in he scowled as us disapprovingly the entire time.  This was very strange since it was early, they had been nothing by nice in making the arragements over the phone and via email, and the place was totally not full. Also, we were all dressed up trying to show each other that we hadn't partied as hard as we could the night prior! Dressed to the nines and very mellow as we dined and tried to eliminate the pain we felt from the night before, we were far from rowdy but this manager acted like we were wild kids who needed to be rushed along.  The wait staff was actually professional and friendly and everyone was well taken care of. We had three awesome options for entrees and the accompaniments were equally delicious. My shortribs were very tasty tho a little on the fatty side (tricky when you're eating with chopsticks). A bunch of people ordered extra food like sushi (strawberry roll!) and sashimi and it was fresh and flavorful. They had a nice selection of tequilas and girly drinks like the cucumber one I was enjoying. Our shared dessert plate was a hit!  I would come back if that manager were off duty for sure!",

Food- great, not exceptional. Tiny portions, which is fine for most dishes in sushi restaurants but not others for the price. They need to learn from Nobu here.  $30 tuna pizza- pricey but worth it bc it's original. $60 for one order of toro sushi (2 pieces).... Not so much.  Service- if I had nothing else planned for the evening, it might be mildly tolerable. We put in an order for 6 items and they rolled out 20-25 apart. Nobody wants to put a tiny piece of fish in their mouth and wait 20+ minutes for the next piece. When we tried to order more food, the server told us that everything roll-like will take 40 minutes and that we should only order off the appetizer page. Obviously this limited our ordering substantially.   This was my first time asking for a manager at a restaurant and he told me that these wait times were very normal. Not how you want to treat guests in my opinion. Never had such an experience at Nobu, Mastros, Katsuya, Mizumi, or anywhere else in LA or Vegas. This ruined the experience for me.  It was a special night for us (anniversary, which nobody mentioned or cared about) and we wanted to have a great time. But sitting at dinner to only grow hungrier was not the way to do it. Next time, we will take our money back to Mizumi, which is a guaranteed five star experience.",

I tried the following dishes, and I have listed in order of how amazing they were:  1. Yellowtail Serrrano - go figure, the yellowtail dish was the best dish at a restaurant named Yellowtail. Thinly sliced with jalapeno and cilantro, the worst part of this was it was 6 pieces and there were 5 of us... dilemma. 2. Rock Shrimp Handroll - this was so yummy, I didn't even offer a bite to the others. 3. Big Eye Tuna Pizza - I'm unsure why others don't like this... it was delicious and a perfect appetizer. 4. Rock Shrimp / Tempura Alaskan King Crab - these were similarly prepared dishes but complemented each other well. When the Rock Shrimp would get a bit too sweet, the Alaskan King Crab balanced it nicely. 5. Red Dragon roll - I only got one piece of this, but it was the best Red Dragon I've ever had. I think the others agreed with me as... you know... I only got one piece. 6. Fillet Mignon Toban - sizzling and amazing. It comes out in a tiny skillet with the best mushrooms I've had in a while. The only reason it's this low on the list is because that is just how awesome all the other food was.  Now, the last two are the only two that we didn't finish, or I wouldn't order again: 7. Kobe Beef Tataki - maybe because it came out with the Yellowtail and just couldn't hold it's own. I really can't remember that much about it. 8. Tempura Veggies - run-of-the-mill like the spicy tuna roll.  I want to go back again and get a table by the windows so I can watch the fountains of the Bellagio while I feast on fish.",

    "text": "I suppose when I saw the \"bigeye tuna pizza\" as being the best dish at this restaurant I should have figured it would be subpar sushi joint.  I have no idea why this place gets so many good reviews but I guess with Vegas being a big tourist area most people reviewing this place have no clue what good sushi tastes like...especially a reviewer that states there is no place better in California!!? I live in Southern Cal and some of the best sushi I've had has been in the LA area i.e. Sasabune, Mori etc. But I'll simplify to specifics:  Service: Sucks...lots of staff running around serving people with way too much money and food takes forever.    Sushi: We tried the bigeye tuna pizza and I guess it was decent...nothing to call home about. As for the sushi...I never knew they could cut sushi so thin and charge so much money.  I don't mind spending money on sushi but throw me a bone and at least make it hearty!? I can't believe they call themselves a sushi joint. I guess Bellagio can get away with charging that much for people that don't want to leave the hotel. The rolls were tiny and mediocre tasting. Usually my wife and I are fighting for the last piece but at Yellowtail we were fine leaving the overpriced food.  Ambiance: I kept reading about being sat by the fountains which is why I chose the place. But the first thing you see on the site \"patio seating is very limited and you are not guaranteed a spot\" Well figures...when we walked in it was packed and we got seated in the middle area which basically defeated the whole purpose of us eating there. It's basically a club that serves sushi.  Summary: A white washed sushi joint for people with too much money.  Lesson learned...Vegas is not the place for sushi...should have listened to the other reviewers. I wish I would have spend my time and money at a restuarant like Joel Rubichon or Bouchons or even just the buffet.  Won't go back. I spent $190 for an appetizer 2 drinks, a couple rolls and a couple pieces of mediocre sushi. I have to give it one star of the cost of food and not meeting our expectations.",

The edimame appetizer was really good. You get one bowl of sea-salted ones and one bowl of them in a sweet chili sauce which was awesome. For my entree I figured 2 rolls would be enough since the waitress said you get 6-8 pieces. Well she was correct, however the peices are VERY small considering the $12-18 price tag. But the sushi was good - I had a spicy tuna roll and the unagi (eel).  Probably wouldn't come back here given the extensive dining options in Vegas and how rarely I'm able to make it out there, but don't let that stop you from going.",

Bottomless mimosas at brunch followed by champagne all day (and I do mean all day), meant I wasn't my most coherent at dinner. I ordered the non-fried chicken option and proceeded to eat it with chopsticks. I loved it at the time, but then again, I probably would have loved anything that sobered me up a bit.   What I do remember, however, is how damn expensive this place was. I did not love that.   I'd give this place 3.5, but I like to round up, so there you go.",

    "text": "We stopped in just for a quick snack before dinner. Originally we planned to get a few cocktails, but had a little bit of sticker shock when we found that the martinis were $20. We ordered the yellowtail sashimi and the big eye tuna that everyone seemed to be raving about. Both were delicious, but they were $30 each. Normally I wouldn't think much of that. I'm a strong believer that you get what you pay for, and when it comes to raw fish, you want high quality. But I felt a little ripped off when I discovered that the same exact appetizers were served at other restaurants within the Bellagio for around $18. This experience alone would have caused me to rate this establishment at three stars. The reason I've opted for two was the service. I had to order several things numerous times since our waitress seemed to keep forgetting. When I ordered the big eye tuna, I also placed an order of standard salmon sashimi. After finishing the big eye tuna, I had to remind my waitress of the salmon sashimi. It took at additional 15 minutes to receive my sushi. No apologies, no discount. Nothing. It appears that this establishment is more interested in hiring for looks rather than talent. Save your money and go somewhere else.",

People that did not have reservations had to wait about a half hour, but since we had reservations, we were seated right away.  The place itself is great, great decor and ambiance, you can see the Bellagio fountains from inside the restaurant. I had a lychee cocktail which was yummy, they have a pretty creative cocktail menu. For dinner, we ordered the seven-course Chef's tasting menu. 1 - Salmon tartare - probably the best I've ever had  2 - Salad with poached eggs and yellowtail - amazing 3 - Sashimi - AMazing 4 - Cod with balsamic reduction - very strong and made me nauseated 5 - Braised Kobe with some reduction (and quail egg, I think) - good 6 - Sushi rolls - 3 or 4 kinds, really good 7 - Dessert was a frothy chocolate drink, which was okay, but whatever the cake was, it was pretty good.  I would probably go back but would stick to Sashimi and rolls, no cod and beef or dessert for me next time.",

Glanced at the menu and started walking away but got pulled back by my significant other with a 'Hey let's try it.' I should have kept on walking to Fix. Service was horrible from when we were seated to our departure. The staff seemed totally disorganized and were running around with a deer in the headlights look. We ordered our beverages and an appetizer immediately but failed to get either until we asked. Not even water was served until we asked. Really? Food was just OK. Nothing wowed me... maybe the foie gras with oyster and scallop dish. Other than that nothing spectacular. Left totally annoyed and unsatisfied. Had to run to Jean Philippe and order a delicious dessert crepe to erase the bad meal at Yellowfish. Next time, we'll just go to Nobu!",

    "text": "We wanted this evening to be memorable, and were looking for a special place for dinner after our vows renewal in Las Vegas with a couple of friend and our both daughters. We had a reservation at 9pm but were 1 1/2 hrs too early. We got a table, regardless. Unfortunately after only a few minutes we were about to leave. The place was incredibly noisy, no way to have a normal conversation. The music was sooo loud, the people's voices level unbearable. We were so disappointed..... We wanted so much this evenIng to be unforgettable. The staff was really nice and showed much understanding for our frustration. First they offered another large table, however the noise wasn't really better. Since the number of available seats on the patio/outside terrace is very limited, the likelihood to get a table for six with no reservation was very low! But i must say i was impressed by their efforts to help us. And after 15-20 min, with a bit of patience they were able to seat us outside, in the patio, with direct view on the Bellagio's fountain with great water choreographies and our evening was saved! Yes, the evening is really memorable. The food was great! We had revisited oysters, tempura crab, a selection of sushi, kobe beef tabaki, i recommend the 'angry salmon', shared plates: yellowtail jalapenos, gratinee seafood, scallops: all was great! My guests were absolutely delighted! But we had our very highlight with the dessert. I am not a 'dessert guy' but what we got that evening was absolutely magic. The yuzu citrus was the best dessert we ever had, the chocolate in a cup with banana foam absolutely top!! It wasn't cheap (700$ for 6 incl 5 glasses of very good chardonnay) but our evening with the fountain spectacle will remain for ever one of our best event!!",

The Tempura Alaskan King Crab and the Gyoza's (5) for $10 were very good, but didn't like this one expensive dish. It had too much over powering flavor, the texture was raw but I believe it was seared fish or something but it was definitely still raw. Gross. I did like the crispy onions on top though. All in all, I wouldn't go back here. It was nice that they catered to us having glasses of blueberry sparkling sake which they brought out to us as we toasted outside and watched the fountain show. Great view of that!",

The best Miso I have had in my life!!! Big Eye Tuna Pizza had quite a bit of hype on-line, it was good don't get me wrong, but nothing to write home about. My husband did enjoy it more than I did however. Kobe Beef Tataki was by far my favorite part of the meal! I am actually salivating over the thought of it. Angry Salmon Roll was delicious as was the California Roll, which had nice chunky pieces of crab as apposed to the crab salad you find at most sushi restaurants. Both rolls were the perfect size, I am not a fan of sushi restaurants that make the rolls so large you cannot fit them into your mouth in one bite. Tuna sashimi was fresh and very delicious, however kind of on the small side. All in all the prices were comparable to our local sushi restaurants. The staff was courteous and quite informative. We enjoyed our waiter immensely, he was very attentive while not being obnoxious!! My husband and I are already discussing our next Vegas trip which will most definitely include a trip back to Yellowtail!",

The restaurant was beautiful and the view of the Bellagio fountains impressive.  But here's the bottom line: at approximately $60/person (including tax and tip), guests should be leaving pleasantly full and impressed with the cuisine.  We left already planning our late night snack and absolutely unimpressed with anything that Yellowtail had to offer.  Their flagship item, the  Big Eye Tuna Pizza was good, but somewhat bland.  We also liked the Edamame Two Ways: Sea Salt and Sweet Chili.  Everything else we ordered was pretty uninteresting, and I've had far better at any number of sushi bars in LA at 1/3 the price.  We had a bland Yellowtail Scallion roll, a lame Spicy Tuna roll, a very fishy Mackerel with Shiso that I couldn't even eat, very average pork Gyoza, and a fairly tasty Seared Albacore with Onion, Crispy Shitake Mushrooms and Chili Sesame.  I don't mind dropping some coin on a great meal, and I am even OK with the concept that I might have to pay a premium for dining at the Bellagio (although I doubt I ever will again, after this meal), but heck...do I have to leave hungry too?",

    "text": "well, where do i start...  before i do that, i would like to say that i am a big foodie, trying out numerous michelin rated chefs and top rated chefs and restaurants.  that is probably why we like going to vegas,, chicago, and nyc for great food.   we were staying at the bellagio to begin with and we already ate at Picasso once again.  so, we thought we tried yellowtail, since the hotel tv talked highly of it.   when we dine at japanese restaurants, we like to do the full omakase dinner, sometimes it can be from a 7 course to even an 12 course type of thing depending on where you end up.  well let me tell you why my husband and i are disappointed with yellowtail.  first the portions are just too small... we were on out 4th course and they are teenie tiny.  we dined at nobu countless times and at masa as well in nyc and vegas, and we have never seen portions that small for an omakase dinner.   then by the time we are all done with all seven courses, my husband and i had to go to the noodles restaurant for another late night supper.   food wise, it was decent, nothing to scream about.  the tuna pizza was different and very light tasting, but other than that, not that great.  we had a little sampler of their rendition of kobe beef, but that so so as well.  nobu does their kobe beef on a hot rock and the taste is much much better.   we dont mind paying for good food, but it has to be good, and at least the portion needed to justify it.  for $150 per person, i expected a bit more in terms of portion.  we gotten more at picasso, and sage in terms of portion, even thought  we spend way more at morimoto or nobu or masa, the portion sizes were just way more and we  didnt have to supplement our dinner with a second dinner.  also, the last thing is the atmosphere,  it is pretty loud here,  we have been to morimoto in nyc and its loud too, but there were a bunch of tipsy people just talking trash behind us.   wouldnt go back there ever.  there's a lot of better places to eat for sushi in vegas.",

    "text": "Yellowtail rocks! I went there about a week ago,  and was amazed by the experience I had.    FOOD, being most important blew me out of the water. I had dishes such as the egg plant skewers, lobster Carpaccio, tuna pizza, walu, and seared albacore, all amazing!!  Also I must say there's something magical to the tempura ice cream I could of eaten 10 of them!   SERVICE, the next most important was perfect to a T. Never too intrusive, polite, and very knowledgeable. I believe our waiters name was Keith, very hansom man, with an army look...  AMBIENCE, last most important completely complimented the food and service. Just and over all good feel to the place, such a beautiful restaurant.",

    "text": "Yellowtail will not overly impress traditional sushi aficionados but for the jetset, it will make for a good change of scenery from Nobu at the HRH for those used to that sort of dining environment.  There are however a fair number of reasons why you might put this on your itinerary for your next Vegas trip:   1) \"NOBU\" FOR ADULTS The decor, the atmosphere, the music, the attractive hostesses... even many of the dishes are blatent clones of Nobu's aesthetic.  Some of Nobu's more famous plates like \"tuna tataki\" have been adapted to \"yellowtail tataki\".  Some dishes served, like Nobu's Toro Tartar, are available as flat out Xeroxed, down to the caviar accenting & ume plum garnish.  That being said, there are some improvements over Nobu that aren't hard to miss: --- CROWD:  The clientele are of a, uh, higher caliber.  Being at the Bellagio makes Yellowtail a target for business dinners & younger committed couples.  This is by design, according to a friend who works there. --- BAR:  The bar is very large & active, not to attract singles but to provide respite for individuals waiting for their tables.  There are 14 first-come-first-served 'bar tables' that you can just jump on & get served at.  And again, since it's at the Bellagio, you'll find it easier to dodge the patented HRH skanks & douchebags. --- SERVICE:  There is a very strict code of service at Yellowtail where \"everyone on the waitstaff is held responsible for any customer's satisfaction\".  They have \"secret shoppers\" go through often to ensure service levels & with the exception of really busy days, this should shine through. --- VIEW:  Call for the 'window view' reservations FAR in advance & you'll have a spectacular view of the Bellagio fountains & the Eiffel Tower at Paris.  2) NOUVEAU JAPANESE DISHES Like most \"trendy\" sushi restaurants, the Yellowtail menu has both traditional as well as avant garde dishes to satisfy any age palette.  Yellowtail didn't hold back in duplicating the \"Hot Dish/Cold Dish\" menu orientation of Nobu, & why should they?  It works & is immensely profitable. A few notes: --- ROCK SHRIMP:  Overly soaked in a cream thai hot sauce that mimics the ludicrous over-saucing of many of today's Americanized sushi \"rolls\".  Similar to a finger foods version of a \"911 roll\", this undoubtedly is a huge moneymaker w/ its cheap ingredients but familiar flavors. --- TORO TARTAR:  An poor clone of Nobu's more famous dishes, this is disappointingly salty.  The soy sauce concoction that the minced toro w/ caviar sits in lacks the savory nature of Nobu's dish because they forgot the bonito stock.  As a result, its got a salty bite & at $39, it's as they say: EPIC FAIL. --- SUSHI:  The salmon & mackerel were fairly good.  Fresh, select, cut correctly, & in good proportions.  The sweet shrimp were actually live amaebi surprisingly.  The deep fried head however was served luke warm, but it was also a pregnant shrimp providing a good amount of roe to accent the head & that sort of made up for it.  I expected the toro & the yellowtail to be good considering how much they must serve at the restaurant. Rock Shrimp/Creamy spicy sauce:  3/5 Toro Tartar: 3/5 Salmon: 4/5 Spanish Mackerel: 4/5 Sweet Shrimp: 5/5 Sweet Shrimp head: 4/5 Toro: 4/5 Yellowtail: 4/5  3) SAKE MENU Yellowtail has a fairly good sake menu that is price-designed very well to direct people to the cheaper high-margin Jokigen.  As a result, don't be surprised if it's \"out of stock\" as a result. --- BEWARE THE SAKE 'SWITCH' Don't order an expensive 'carafe' of sake if you don't know what you're doing.  I received a tokkuri of sake - the Mukune, which I've had many times before.   They serve the Junmai Ginjoshu which is dry & a little earthy but still lightly fragrant.  What was given to me was none of the above, making it either a) not Mukune or b) very old.  To the wait staff's surprise, I demanded that they bring out the sake bottle.  Not surprisingly, they chose not to & instead brought out a completely new unopened bottle of Mukune.  The bottle's production date was 9/08 & lo-and-behold, the flavor was greatly improved from the first. --- EXPERT'S HINT:  If you order a 'carafe' of sake, request that your sake be served in a 'tokkuri' or ceramic flask COLD & have them bring out the bottle at Yellowtail.  And most importantly, do not let them pour it into those bamboo shoots - it distorts & changes the flavor.  CONCLUSION: For the strip, this is about as good as you're going to get.  There's better in Vegas, but not by much.  4-stars.  ----- NOTE: Yellowtail does not have the \"most comprehensive sake menu in Vegas\".  That award goes to Okada & Shibuya, as any sake distributor will confirm.   And as for the dude that recommended \"the sushi bar inside Caesar's Palace (next to Cleopatra's Barge)\" over Yellowtail, that place is called \"Hyakumi\".  It has an all-you-can-eat sushi deal during lunch if that tells you anything. [shakes head]",

It was so dark that everyone in our party had to use their cell phone lights to be able to read their menus. The quality of the sushi/sushi-mi was adequate, but I've had better Sushi experiences in Colorado thousands of miles from the ocean. Very small portions for very high prices, so you have to order 3x as much. Made the mistake of taking our waiter's recommendation of the tuna \"pizza\" which was little more than some thin slices of tuna on a burnt 8\" tortilla for $26. Saki prices STARTED at $30 for a tiny carafe and beers were $12 each for Sapporo and Asahi. Our bill, with just 2 beers 2 rolls, 3 two slice orders of sushi and the nasty Tuna Tortilla \"Pizza\" came out to just under $200 for the 2 of us. The food was ok, presentation was better, but the service left a lot to be desired. Later",

Regardless, that's the main draw to this place as the sushi is sub par.  Ordered the spicy tuna, popping spicy crab (best of the 3), and unagi.  Seaweed salad was predictable.  The  mixed drinks were $20 each, but strong, flavorful, and ordained with chocolate covered strawberries or star shaped pineapple.  So yeah, only they were worth it.  $110 for 2 ppl with drinks = better meals to be had in this city.",

    "text": "Finally got to check out the new J-spot in the Bellagio on my last trip.  It's definitely elegantly designed and does its job in attracting the hip/beautiful crowd but I can't say it's any different than the other Nobu ripoffs you see in town.  We got the traditional sashimi dishes, the yellowtail serrano and the hirame usuzukuri, and thought both were ok.  They didn't have as extensive of a sushi selection as I anticapted which really surprised me, considering being in the Bellagio, and to make matters worse, they were out of two of my favorites uni and mirugai.  Not having abalone on the menu is excusable but really disappointed me as well.  I tried the strawberry roll out of curiousity and was surprised that flavor combo of fruit and spicy tuna tasted actually alright together (props to being bold).  The two pluses for the night were the miso soup of all things (which really tasted more like a fish stock soup) and our sommelier Yukiko.  Yukiko was super friendly and after politely asking what type of sake we liked, she paired us with a real nice Daiginjo from the Murai Family.  I highly recommend this bottle. It's good to see that they have the sake segment of their restaurant in the right hands.  I read another reviewers remarks about the wine list being bad but I've always thought wine with sushi was weird anyways...just stick with sake and beer.  Making reservations is a must and pricing is in the Nobu neighborhood.  If you can, try to get a seat outside on their patio which allows you to watch the water show.  Although the hostess are definitely attractive, you're not missing much in terms of decor on the inside.",

Our waiter was friendly enough, although he brought us the bill without removing the item we sent back.....was it on purpose?...Probly not, but when someone is spending $400, don't try and throw in extra stuff on the bill.... The hostess was a biatch! Yes, we showed up late for our reservation, but at 9pm telling someone that there would be no more tables for the rest of the night on the patio.....really?

Yellowtail at the Bellagio Hotel in Vegas is an excellent choice.  We started out with endamame (soybeans) which came out in 2 flavors:  with sea salt or wok fried with a sweet chili sauce.  The sea salt was good, but the sweet chili sauce was a little too oily for our tastes.  It's something a white person would eat and like, but for Asians don't do it! It was like something from Panda Express - the white man's chinese food.  Our next try was the spicy miso soup with crab. It was not too spicy, pretty good, but the crab made it a little fishy tasting.  Next we tried yellowtail sashimi and giant clams. Both were delicious and fresh tasting.  Yellowtail has fish flown in daily. Next we had the kobe beef skewers.  It tastes like real kobe beef.  Alot of times you go to places that sell Kobe beef and it just tastes like regular American angus. We finished off with mango sorbet and mochi balls.  The fried mochi balls are good if you like that doughy mochi taste.  Try the Omakase.  It's a six course fixed menu.  It will give you a little sample of everything.  Do not try the melon martini.  It was gross and creamy.  Creamy martinis are always disgusting.  Service gets an A+ here.  There are always about 5 people nearby just waiting to meet your needs.  Oh and this is not your traditional sushi place with the sweet Japanese girls.  The girls look like the \"me love you long time\" type in shorty slutty cleavagey dresses.  I think that big fake racks are required to work here since all of the girls had them. The tits here are better than they are Hooters. It's great for people watching!",

We walked in last Sunday night after the \"O\" show got out and were able to get a table wo reservations. We basically ordered almost all the vegetarian stuff that wasn't sweet or fried off the menu:  -edamame: come in regular and spicy, and served warm. that was interesting. regular was a little too salty for me, but Boyfriend preferred them over the spicy ones. -oshitashi: good grief this was expensive for what it was. Okay I know all is like that, but...it was alright. the red beets were just julienned on top...nothing to write home about really -seaweed salad: rather interesting with the inclusion of non-traditional seaweed (i only recognized the wakame). this was rather bland 'cuz the dressing kept \"falling off\" into the bottom of the plate -assorted mushrooms:  HOLY FREAKIN' GOODNESS = reminded me of the frickin' delicious mushrooms @ Tokyo-Go-Go (SF)...'NUFF SAID (aka \"it tastes like it has buttah insoyde\" aka butter is totally in that awesome sauce and I dipped my ikura sushi rice in there to sop it all up) -ikura sushi: this was really good. actually no fishy taste at all and not too salty.  wow. -tamago sushi: um...this was like eating egg spongecake...we were confused.  Amazingly we got full. Boyfriend had a $20 glass of champagne and that wasn't even the most expensive glass..it did taste better than my $12 champagne (don't ask why we were drinking champagne in Vegas).   Beef 1: We did order the vegetable sushi roll, but they forgot about it, so we just took it off the bill.  Beef 2: Our server suffered from tunnel vision. She was nice enough, and spoke clearly and whatnot, but we had a lovely time trying to flag her down.  If I find myself in the Bellagio again, I'm going to just go here for (overpriced) drinks and eat tons of the mixed mushroom plates. I felt like there's definitely better for the price, and I only give it 3 stars because of those mushrooms and the fresh-@$$ ikura.  And for the record, we paid ~$86 for vegetables and a glass of the cheapest champagne they had. (Boyfriend got his $20 glass from the bar while we waited.)",

    "text": "There was no question that a new sushi restaurant in the Bellagio has high expectations along with high prices. We were looking for a great place to take our customers after long meetings during the day and Yellowtail seemed like the beat choice after pieros and Spago on previous nights.  We ordered based off recommendations from our waitress. During dinner we realized that a lot of the food seemed familiar. Nobu! We actually ate at Nobu in Manhattan a few weeks before. The crab calamari, sashimi with jalapenos were very memorable from Nobu and were nearly identical to what Yellowtail offered. Not sure if there is any affiliation but we were joking that we found the second nobu branch in las vegas.  Besides those dishes the sushi was well prepared but the cuts and taste of some of the fish itself wasn't the greatest.",

The toro was amazing.  Hot oil seared salmon - again, melts in your mouth.  Most of us got just plates and plates of sashimi and sushi but some got the meat entrees.  The short ribs were great - very tender, fall of the bone, and great flavor.  The salmon was not too heavy (good if u r going clubbing afterwards).  Atmosphere was hip and the service was great.  They have a sake somalier who can help you pick out some nice sake to compliment the food.  I do agree the pop rock thing was kind of weird.",

    "text": "Visited Yellowtail twice during a 5 day stay in Vegas.  We usually stay at the Bellagio but because my husband does not eat sushi or fish of any kind, this isn't a restaurant I would pick for the two of us. However, we were meeting a friend who is a local and said we had to go.  We did and my husband was an instant fan.  A lot of their items are a shared plate (warm and cold) as well as the rolls, etc.  My friend and I shared the tuna pizza which is excellent!  It consists of a toasted tortilla (whole wheat I think) with thinly sliced red onion, some sort of white sauce and then the tuna on top.  Delish!  We also had the yellow tail which was good (a nice light fish).  My favorite was the king crab tempura.  To top things off we had a spicy tuna roll.  We would have loved to try more but there is only so much you can eat.  My husband had the aged Kobe beef flat iron steak which was sliced and served with a teriyaki sauce on top of some root vegetables.  He ordered this the 2nd time we were there as well but ordered a bowl of rice since he felt he needed a bit more to eat since he passed on sharing our plates.  The hostess was great, she remembered us right away.  There was one hostess (not at the desk) that sat us and she was not friendly at all but that did not detract from our night.  The waitstaff was so friendly and when we asked for suggestions, they were spot-on.  I loved the whole ambience of this type of restaurant. First off, it overlooks the fountains at the bellagio.  The restaurant is small so make your reservations.  The music that played, the design, all great.",

Not only was the size very small...smaller than a regular sushi place but the quality was not only disappointing, it just wasn't that good. Had I eaten this from a to go box, I would've thought it was from a grocery store.  It is unbelievable that they would charge the absolutely outrageous prices they charge and not have the quality back it up a thousand percent. A hand roll is literally 2 bites, the fish in a sushi order is thin, small and tasteless, the regular rolls were decent but at $32/roll, I thought my socks would be blown off. We asked if they did fried rice and the waitress said they could make it but it would be a $45 charge. Ridiculous! The ONLY redeeming part of the whole meal was that it's located next to the Bellagio fountain and we asked to sit outside for my daughter's birthday. Definitely skip this place! So many other places to go, this place isn't it!!",

I'm highly doubtful at the skill of a sushi chef who would let bad sashimi pass in front of a customer. If you've ever watched Jiro Dreams of Sushi, you would agree that you should not serve something that doesn't initially pass your chef's quality of taste. I'm sorry, but I'm never coming here again.",

We get there and it was packed, so we decided to sit at the bar, where there were some seats.   Service in the beginning was spectacular, really nice bartenders, suggesting what is good on the menu.  I wanted everything on the menu but it was a bit pricey so had to be selective.   Their edamame app is unique as it comes with two bowls of edamame one tradition with the salt, and one with a sweet chili sauce. Both were fantastic and just the right thing to have before the sushi.  Next up, Miso soup - delicious!!   I had ordered sushi, along with my two other friends, and figured it would be up after the apps.  It was a long wait for the first round of sushi for my friends, and even longer for me :( They had forgotten about my order and somehow the sushi chefs never got it! The bartender (our server) was trying to figure out what happened.  He gave us a round of drinks on the house to apologize.    Personally, I was not even that mad even with him apologizing so many times, and him saying this was not acceptable to their restaurant.  I was just happy to be in Vegas an having a good time.  Yeah, it did suck that my wait was really long. Never had to wait that long before in my life.  Hopefully in the future that does not happen with anyone else.  Once I finally got my sushi roll, Shrimp Tempura type I think it was, it was delicious and so happy it was good for me waiting so long.   I would want to try this restaurant out again but at a table next time and not the bar :)",

    "text": "NOT A RUN OF THE MILL SUSHI BAR...  Well, I guess I'm a little biased with this review.  You see, I visited YT on a night where the stars were completely aligned.    Akira Back present - Check Cameraman filming Akira Back - Check Akira Back dedicated to our table alone (due to the 10+ group)- Check Akira Back dedicated to our table alone while being filmed - Check Akira Back dedicated to our table alone while being filmed and making his favorite dishes - Check...mate...  I'm typically not a big Vegas sushi joint kind of guy.  I like my hole in the wall, off the beaten path sushi places.  I think that there are sushi chef's in smaller places that outperform the renowned.  Perfect example is Crazy Sushi in St. Peters, MO.  One of the best IMO.  Why do they not have a Crazy Sushi in a Vegas casino?  Thus going into YT I was skeptical, and preparing for the same roll I could get somewhere not Vegas for a lot less $$$.  Yellow tail was a great experience, and I understand why Akira has his own place at the Bellagio.  This isn't Dragon, Philly, or Vegas rolls, and if that's what you want go elsewhere because you are going to overpay for very basic sushi.  Sushi is a very tiny piece of YT.  Notice this says Yellowtail Japanese Restaurant, and not Yellowtail Sushi Bar.  There you have it... I have still avoided going to a Vegas sushi bar.  Like I said, we were treated to a much different experience than someone who waltzed in on any given night.  Akira is not always in, and I doubt I will ever visit a restaurant again where the chef is being filmed while making my dinner.  FYI Akira Back was on Iron Chef North America...     We did a hybrid Omakase  which is the 7 course sampler.  I think we received over 7 courses, and I think this was due to Akira, and the camera guy.  Again, stars aligned...  Also we agreed with the server to let him make whatever he wants for us which probably didn't hurt either.  From the first dish which was his pizza, I started realizing why YT is different, and not a sushi bar.  I really like truffle oil when it's applied to the right dish.  You wouldn't think raw fish would mesh well with the pungent truffle oil, but it goes great with the other flavors of the pizza.    The kobe beef tataki was awesome, as was the protein roll.    The pop rock roll was just odd to say the least, but was freaking amazing.  Pop rocks in sushi WTF?  Only in Vegas.  There was also a roll brought out, and I want to say it had strawberries and tuna in it.    There was agrilled walu which was outstanding...    The kobe short rib dish he made for us was awesome as well.  I think we asked for another round of the ribs, and walu.    I could have done without the rock shrimp.  Shrimp is just meh for me. I don't get excited over it because well... its just shrimp.  Shrimp should be the chicken of the sea, not canned tuna.  With that being said, the table loved it, and if you are a shrimp lover you'll go nuts over it.  Anyhow, those were some of the dishes that really stood out for me at YT.     I'm pretty sure we had something chicken and sashimi as well.  They were good, but drowned out by the quality of the courses I mentioned.  Appearance, flavor, and quality were top notch.  Akira Back should be very proud of his ability to be extremely creative with food, and a pallet that knows what goes.  Would I have enjoyed the restaurant as much on any other night? I don't know.  I  wouldn't have been as daring and would have just ordered some rolls, and the pizza.  I probably wouldn't have went to YT because I would have thought it was just another sushi joint.  Things happen for a reason right?  I can share my experiences so you can either walk-in, or walk-by.    I think this place is well worth the money.  Sure it's expensive, but seriously folks... if you're worried about price why the hell are you considering eating at the Bellagio to begin with?  Hey I look for the 5.00 tables, but that's only because I am a shitty gambler.  For dinner I go all in...",

    "text": "Lets walk through from the beginning. We had a reservation for 9:30 pm. We showed up precisely at 9:30 and checked in, were asked to give them a minute and please go to the bar if we wished. We waited a couple minutes for a place at the bar to open up and then ordered a drink. We sat and watched as walk ups were seated before us, including a couple of girls who walked up and hugged the hostess and were seated immediately. While I am not too stupid to understand that some people \"deserve\" to be seated immediately, it was disheartening seeing walk-ups get seated before us. I guess I wouldnt have a problem if they said they dont accept reservations, but they do, so I didnt understand the point of having one if it took 20-25 minutes to get seated.  So with that negative, lets say a positive. Our servers was perhaps the best server Ive had at any restaurant, high end or otherwise. I believe his name was Nick. Just wanted to give a shout-out because he was that good. We never ask to speak with management, but made sure we did this time to put in a good word for our server.  So, the food. It was good, and some of it great. Pricey, but then again, we knew that going in.  The yellowtail Serrano appetizer was outstanding. It practicably melted in my mouth. The Gyoza app was good, but nothing special.  The edamame was good too, I mean, its edamame, how could you mess it up? I wasnt a fan of the sweet chile flavor, but the gf loved it. The japanese pickles salad was awesome!  One of their signature rolls is the Popping Spicy Crab...it was ok. Seemed a little gimmicky, but wasnt bad. The yellowtail scallion roll was very tasty, as was the spicy tuna roll. I also had some scallop sashimi...it was very tender and had good flavor.  Overall impression, it was good, but slightly over-priced. You pay for the atmosphere and to be at the \"cool\" place to be. Dont get me wrong, the food was good, and I wouldnt hesitate to go back again, but just be warned you arent going to be absolutely blown away with some new type of sushi. You are going for good sushi (better than 90% of places), and for the atmosphere with outstanding service (once you get seated).",

    "text": "WHERE: Inside the Bellagio Hotel/Casino.  WHEN: Dinner only! Monday-Thursday, 5pm-10pm. Friday-Sunday, 5pm-11pm. It is also recommended to make reservations during the weekend just incase it gets a little busy.  WHY: The dishes are worth the while (or at least the ones that I got the pleasure to try tonight! =D)  WHAT: So... first thing's first. I actually got home not too long ago from eating here.  Right after my amazing experience in this great atmosphere, the only thing I could think of was \"I'm so going home and writing a review!\" So here I am, and here I go...  One of my good friends has been talking about how great everything was for the past year. So after a year, we finally got together to make it happen! Prior to getting to the restaurant, I was extremely giddy and excited!!  When we got to the restaurant, checked in, and got seated, we automatically were asked what we wanted to drink. Tangent! Before I forget, customer service was at its best! Anyways, back to my experience. We weren't as hungry, so we all decided to get an appetizer each and share. =) That's what friends are for.  FOOD: Keep in mind, the portions are small, but so worth your taste buds!  We started off with Edamame.  There were 2 bowls, one with cold, salted edamame beans, and the other with a warm and cooked-in-some-good sauce (sweet chili) edamame beans. Always such a great starter!  Eggplant Skewers:  One thing, I am not an eggplant fan, but I am not afraid to try it. My friend recommended I try this, and thank goodness she made that recommendation! It did not taste like eggplant at all. It tasted like bbq on a stick brushed with sweet miso and sesame sauce goodness. KUDOS!  Big Eye Tuna Pizza:  Definitely not like your ordinary pizza! One of greatest things I have ever eaten! To simplify such a magnificent dish, it was smoked tuna on some type of cracker/bread (which made it a pizza). Everyone must try this! KUDOS!  Popping Spicy Crab: Why come to a sushi joint and not order at least one roll?! We made the right choice. If like uniqueness in taste, be sure to taste this roll! Who would have thought that pop rocks (candy) can enhance a simple sushi roll?! It was magical! KUDOS!  Lava Cake: For dessert (I always have my heart, mouth, and tummy ready for dessert), I was given the duty of choosing. I chose correct! To explain this lava cake, it was a small, dark chocolate-filled cake, topped with banana foam, and lychee ice cream on the side! Perfect amount, perfect taste, just pure perfection!  To sum it all up, I had a wonderful time with my friends, the staff, and most definitely the food. We also got to say hello and converse with Chef Akira Back! He is very down-to-earth and such a great chef!  I leave you with this. KUDOS, KUDOS, KUDOS!",

    "text": "Yellowtail remains one of the top modern Japanese restaurants on the Strip.  The food here is inventive with bold flavors.  Stay adventerious when ordering; you will be rewarded.  The majority of the dishes are made to be shared (although the portions are not too large that those dining alone will not have a decent selection).    The tai (snapper) served sashimi style with EVOO and shiso is excellent.  The peppery edge of the oil enhances the sweetness of the fish.  The lobster carpaccio is amazing.  The sweetness of the lobster and the onion play off each other beautifully and offers the perfect textural contrast.  Finally, the kobe beef tataki is an absolute must try.  Roll up the paper thin slice around a sliver of garlic and spicy diakon pickle and pop it in your mouth.  It's amazing how the bold flavor of the garlic is washed away by the fat of the beef as it melt in your mouth.  For warm plates, top props to the \"Seafood Dynamite\".  Lightly broiled king crab and rock shrimp dressed in a spicy yet not cloying citrus aioli; delicious.  The nigiri sushi is all very high quality but boring when compared to the inventive speciality rolls.  The \"Popping Spicy Crab\" is a serious must try.  Crab, spicy aioli, cucumber, asparagus, and POP ROCKS!  Just try it.  Service is excellent.  The wine / sake list is very good with well chosen selections by the glass.  Prices are high (remember, you're at the Bellagio).  Highly Recommended.",

That's all I've really got to say here, but I will probably write a lot more because as a lady friend of mine just recently said, I am long winded. What is that supposed to mean, exactly? I talk too much, I write too much, and I am awesome at underwater gameplay? Well, duh. To all three.  I ordered a usual array of rolls, nigiri, sashimi, and beverages. I suppose in a restaurant review you would imagine I would give you more details, but in response to that, I would say that you have quite the active imagination, as I am not going to give you any more details and you will have to just deal with that. Boom.  We sat at the bar and our first server aka bartender was so inattentive that the other bartender just stole us from him without even trying. He kind of looked like a mentally challenged version of a celebrity that I can't remember ... I think it was Rupert Everett. If you come across that guy, or a guy that remotely resembles him, or in fact, if you are ever served by someone who looks mentally challenged, well, maybe you can expect the same time of service.  The girl we got after he wandered into a corner and couldn't find his way back to the bar was very good. I stole a paper coaster. Father please forgive me for my trespasses.",

    "text": "I am shocked that this place has a 4 star average. Absolutely floored.   In Vegas for the weekend, the wife and I want sushi. We decide to give Yellowtail a try. The hostess tells us she'll have a table for us in 20 minutes. Great, we go to the bar.  35 minutes later I go back to check in and a different hostess tells me it will probably be another 15 minutes. Meanwhile the place is at least 1/3 empty. They're probably trying to create that fake buzz that the restaurant is more popular than it actually is. Annoying, but I guess that's part of Vegas. At one point the bartender even asked us \"You guys are STILL waiting for a table?\" When we said yes, he actually went up to the hostess stand on our behalf. Not sure that it did much, but we were appreciative all the same.  After waiting for about 45 minutes in a 1/3 empty restaurant we finally get seated. The decor of this place is nice, I'll give it that. One of the few redeeming qualities of Yellowtail.  We're seated by the window facing the fountain show outside The Bellagio. Nice setting. Unfortunately things went down from there.  We ask to start with some edamame and the King Crab Dynamite starter. Then we order a couple different rolls and a few types of nigiri sushi. The starter arrives (the edamame never actually showed up) and within 2 minutes all the rolls and sushi were on the table. Shouldn't you have at least 5-10 minutes minimum to eat your starter before the rest of your meal is being hustled to the table? The restaurant at this point is probably 1/2 empty.  It wasn't like they had to turn over the table quickly for other waiting guests.  It's not even worth rehashing exactly what type of rolls and sushi we ordered because it was all pretty poor, as was the crab starter. The quality of the fish here is equal to what you get in those pre-packaged Safeway sushi trays. No lie, it's on that same level. Certainly not what I expected given the decor of the restaurant and the exorbitant prices. We were ready to drop some $$$ for a good meal. We certainly dropped the $$$, but Yellowtail didn't deliver on the good meal.  2 Large Sapporo's, 2 glasses of champagne ($30 total), King Crab Starter, 2 rolls, 6 total pieces of Nigiri cost $170!! $170 and I left hungry.  My advice for anyone thinking of going to Yellowtail... instead go to Safeway, buy a few of those pre-packaged sushi trays, a 6 pack of Sapporo and a bottle of champagne and take it back to your room. Same quality food and to complete the effect, you can even make yourself wait 45 minutes to eat it. And the best part is that you'll have an extra $120 in your pocket to spend in Vegas.",

I booked the reservation online, and was very satisfied.  My boyfriend and I were seated right away.  Our server was attentive and courteous for the duration of the meal.  Order three appetizers: the standard edamame and gyoza (particularly delicious) and Alaskan King Crab tempura (our server's recommendation).  Other than looking like tater-tots, the tempura was very good.  My rolls were amazing: the yellowtail scallion (made sense to order the namesake) and the Rock Shrimp handroll.  Boyfriend's special lobster/tuna concoction was not worth the price.  Spicy tuna was good.  As others have said, liquor prices are ridiculous.  While the prices for the rolls were generally reasonable (around $15), the cheapest carafe of sake was $35.  Stupid.",

    "text": "I have eaten at Yellowtail three times now... and this review will encompass all three trips: In my humble opinion, yellowtail should change its website to BOMB.COM!  Seriously, how they get such FRESH sushi in the middle of a desert baffles me, Vegas rules, man. I've had a Tuna pizza, delish... multiple rolls of their sushi... amazing... And the love of my pallet, their Kobe steak, it's like a meat explosion in your mouth... (um, wow, screw it, I'm leaving it just like that.)... It IS pricey... the Kobe alone will run you upwards of 40 green backs for a pretty small steak (I couls easily crush two of them).  But its worth it! Drinks are really well made here, order something different, you;ll be surprised. And if you want to eat here, call ahead, if the weather is nice, ask for fountain side outdoor seating, best ground level view of the Bellagio fountain show. Oh yeah, they have this sweet deal... if you buy Cirque De Soleil \"O\" show tickets, you can upgrade to a package deal for 13 more dollars, the package includes a free drink at a bellagio bar, your O show tix, and dinner at Yellowtail!!! Of course, its off of a limited menu, but still very tasty stuff.  Try it out, and off topic, O will blow your MIND!  Cheers-  dRe'",

The waitress forgot to bring our second round of drinks, we ended up cancelling the rest of our order... the food quality is overrated. The man sitting beside me left because he didn't want to suffer the same fate. Furthermore, the food service manager had nothing to say after we advised him of what had transpired. I find this unacceptable.  We travel extensively and dine frequently. I highly recommend hitting up Olives or Michael Mina if you want real food AND good service.",

I already am a fan of truffle oil, so I knew this dish had to be good. The kobe beef tataki just bursted with flavor in your mouth. I also tried the sushi with the pop rocks which the name in itself already caught my attention. I think it's a cool concept but I personally did not like the sweetness from the pop rocks mixed with the sushi. I do appreciate the chef's creativeness in this. Overall, very good experience here, not to mention the beautiful backdrop of the Bellagio water show in the background at night.",

We ordered the big eye tuna pizza, popping spicy crab roll, seafood \"dynamite\", some nigiri and a Maine lobster roll (a special that evening). Each dish was good, the tuna pizza was very delicious. The pop rocks in the spicy crab roll are amusing. It's a nice bit of sushi, the candy doesn't add all that much, but puts a smile on your face. The seafood dynamite was the least refined of the dishes, very stew-like but still good. We were offered a special roll that was made with Maine lobster, it had flavor reminiscent of the tuna pizza which we loved and the lobster was excellent. The unagi, maguro and shiro maguro were all very nice.  Our server, Teo (sp?), was attentive and made our experience a comfortable one. He was very knowledgeable about the dishes and his description of the lobster sold us on that fine dish.  Yellowtail's beautiful space just added to the overall positive experience. We will definitely return.  Total bill with tax/tip $240 (2 rounds of cocktails).",

Everything was great and the only slight downside to the evening was arguing over who might have eaten the shrimp's eyeball (it had fallen out). We had a nice dinner. I wouldn't rate it five stars simply because while our experience was good, it wasn't spectacular or particularly memorable either.

It is loud, and not in a good way; sounds like you are in the kitchen. I'm not stingy when it comes to fancy dining, especially Vegas; I know you pay a lot for a little in places like this, but this place is ridiculous! The portions are so small, its hard to share something with even two people (and we had 10), so if everyone wanted to try something, we had to place 5 orders for it!!$  The waiter came by every now and then, and had to yell over the ambient noise; AND forgot either a drink or menu item more than a couple times.   As for the food...eh. Although the fish/shellfish in the apps tasted extremely fresh, it seems as though everything was drenched in truffle oil to make it seem fancy [hire a new head chef]. The rolls were about the size of my index finger, so tasting the fish/ingredients over the rice they were rolled in was a task. This isn't the only sushi restaurant in Vegas, I recommend trying one of the others before you step foot in here.   *We ended up spending well over $100 per person, and had to grab a real dinner soon there after. Not one person in our party of 8 girls and 2 guys were full after that.  Sorry Yellowtail, you are going to have to kick it up a few notches.",

The views are wonderful ( overlooks the water fountains), decor is nice and the food was top notch. The Big Eye Tuna Pizza is the talk of the town! However on my last visit I noticed the service and sushi quality has gone down a bit. I am not sure if everyone was having a bad day or if it was an off night but the our waiter was non-existent and messed up our order on top of it. There were major D staff just walking around and pretty much not talking to anyone or asking how things are going. The Sushi felt like it was unpackaged from a supermarket shelf and served to us. The Kobe Beef showed up cold. You get the picture :) I will not give up on this place just yet and will give it one more try in the future but keep and eye out for bad service and low quality sushi. For what you pay for this place the experience should be better.",

I did order a Sunrise cocktail though, and that is the only reason I'm rating this a 3 and not a 2. Grey Goose L'Orange vodka, blood orange puree, yuzu, and shiso leaf. Very very good.

We wandered in while waiting for some friends to get in on our first night in Vegas, and we were seated in the front section, out in the casino - honestly until now I had no idea you could get a view of the Bellagio fountains!! Will definitely push for that next time.   We ordered the edamame and two share plates - rock shrimp and tempura crab. The edamame was unique - came in two dishes, one with rock salt and the other with chili sauce. The rock shrimp was good but the sauce was too creamy for my taste. The crab was, hands down, the star of the show. Huge chunks of crab. Tasty (ponzu?) sauce. We also had the chocolate lava cake which was delicious, although not very lava-y by my standards .... I like my chocolate to ooze. Our drinks were amazing - I had the blood orange and my bf had the kiwi (this will make sense when you see the drink menu).   One gripe - I hear they have super nice bathrooms, but when I went they were shut down and I was (sternly) directed out of the restaurant. The food was definitely tasty - if I were in Vegas again I would go back to try some other things on the menu ...which could push my stars up to 4 (stay tuned).",

After that waiter came, we were completely forgotten about. I don't even understand how this is possible, as we had a waiter come by in the first place. A table next to us was seated five minutes later and ordered their drinks and meals while we continued to sit. Finally, after 15 minutes of sitting there we flagged down a bus boy who said we would get our waiter. Another 5 minutes go by and a waiter comes to the table and proceeds to tell us that he is going to get YET ANOTHER WAITER?  After waiting another 5 minutes we walked out. I don't understand how this is even possible. The restaurant wasn't full, there were waitstaff all around, yet we could not get anyone to take our order.  Pretty sure we would still be sitting there waiting for service at this very moment if we hadn't left!",

With a view right over the fountain show, Yellowtail amazes with beautifully presented sashimi, sushi, steak and lobster. We shared a large array of plates for our group ranging from Kobe beef to tuna crudo to some of the best uni I've ever had.  Try the big eye tuna pizza and the sushi with pop rocks!  Definitely on the pricey side but worth it!",

I'd highly highly recommend sitting outside even if it's cold. We got to see the Bellagio fountain go off every 15 minutes during our meal. And they have heat lamps. Quite romantic. And quiet which is always nice in vegas and seldom occurs.",

    "text": "The raves about new style sashimi couldn't be more spot on- so so good. We ordered the salmon new style sashimi because I love sashimi and then some rolls because my fiance loves sushi rolls. The quality of food was superb. The rolls were interesting and unique, we got a unagi, the pop rocks one, and a the tuna belly scallion roll.   The pop rocks roll is funky but good, it's almost like a dessert roll. The other two were tasty and fresh.   The menu is pricey but consider where you are and our view of the bellagio fountains was immaculate. I requested an intimate table and they delivered nothing short. My fiance was so impressed. We had great service from the host to the server to their readiness to pour water at any time ours was low.   Thank you, we will be back next time we are in town!!",

She didn't introduce herself as she approached our table and just jumped right into her \"sales pitch\". However, this was a minor detail to our overall evening, which was exceptional.",

We were given a table on the waterfront and got to watch the fountains go off. It was the most perfect evening. The tuna pizza is a must as well as the protein roll and mile high roll. My girls and I just absolutely loved this place. There were a couple girls who aren't sushi fans and they still found some great food to enjoy. This restaurant is a must if you are in town!!!",

But I was also covering for the birthday girl. 10 girls.... $959 (double damn)  With that being said.... Our server  Emmanuel was very attentive. He asked once, by name, if we were waiting on the birthday girl. After he knew who she was... He kept calling her by name all night. Even snuck the dessert menu over to us while she was on a bathroom break! He's good... Really good! I'm was stuck trying to figure out how he got her to go to the bathroom on queue. Lmao   Right away we ordered the edamame, in which we wanted both bowls to be sweet chili instead of sea salt (the best way to order them).   There were a few things on the table... Let's see if I can remember them all.     My favorite roll is the high steaks! It's a shrimp tempura roll topped with filet mignon and A1 sauce. It's a interesting combination... But a good one.   Mushroom as a side.... Soooo much flavor!!!!   Rock shrimp- a little dry. Not as good as Nobu  Chilean Sea bass- great tasting... Small serving.   Nope, can barely remember anything else (I had a lot to drink) but I'll post the pictures!   Just make sure when you come here you bring both of your wallets, because it won't be a cheap night out. Also, if you're in a big group they don't split checks... Not even three ways!!!!",

We ordered appetizers and all looked to be going well.  Then it turned into a miserable time.  The halibut was delivered first.  Then a shareable plate.  Then nothing for OVER 45 minutes.  We had show tickets at 9:30.  I alerted the server that we needed our food.  He said it would be just 3-5 minutes.  10 minutes later 4 of the 5 meals were served.  Mine not being one of them.  4 of us left for the show...me without food.  The 2 remaining finally got the bill 15 min later where they comped my meal.  They paid the bill after chatting for a few more minutes and the waiter finally brought my Sushi rolls... I wasn't there to enjoy them but...so needless to say if you have a relatively large group, are in a hurry, along with wanting your party's meals delivered at the same time this is not the place.",

She had some kind of BBQ roll? It was amazing. I had the yellowtail roll and the salmon sashimi. The sashimi was good, but it was pricey for just three pieces of fish. The miso soup was good, but really just like other miso soups out there. The mixed drink I had was a cucumber martini and so refreshing. We also indulged in an apple dessert and my gosh, you guessed it, amazing! Ha. Definitely check this place out. It's pricey, but I feel like everything in Vegas is.",

Happa ( spicy tuna ) and Crispy Kalbi ( warm Kali need rolled and topped with cold coleslaw. Refreshing surprise. Every morsel was cooked ( served raw )  to perfection making me want more. The rolls were the highlight , very creative bursting with flavor and served to please the eye. They say you eat with your eyes first and this places captures your attention with every dish.

We hung out with her while we waited for our table outside. She was super friendly and my friend was enamored with her beauty. He probably creeped her out, but she handled his douchey-ness well.   We were seated outside, and while I've seen the Bellagio fountains a thousand times, my friend was awe struck by our table location and the fountains. Nick was our server, he was friendly and personable, and guided us in the right direction for menu choices. He suggested the tempura king crab and tuna pizza. Even if you don't have a full meal, stop in for those two items. Cash. Money. Hoes. We ordered a bunch of rolls, but our Pop Rock Crab roll was a party in my mouth. Sorry gentleman, this is a PG show, no gutter thoughts. Nick was super sweet, he must've overheard it was my friend's birthday because when we ordered the chocolate cup dessert, it had a little 'Happy Birthday' note. I didn't even say anything to the hostess when I made the reso, so it was a very nice touch for a server to take notice.",

Located in the Bellagio hotel with great views of the famed fountains, the restaurant is trendy and sophisticated without being too fancy or stuff. The service was fantastic. Every bite of food was incredibly fresh and delicious. I particularly loved the Salmon Triadito (this was one of the most fresh, clean, refreshing, and perfect raw dishes I have ever had) and the Seared Diver Sea Scallops.  The restaurant really went above and beyond though when dealing with an allergy of mine. I was intrigued by the idea of a sushi roll with pop rocks in it (when in Vegas!) but the one on the menu comes with Crab, which I cannot eat. Luckily the chef prepared a version of the roll for me with spicy tuna instead... and it was awesome! A rare delight of candy and savory food working together with such a fun, unique mouthfeel.  I would definitely return on my next trip to Vegas. They made me feel like a king!",

But if you want fresh fish done in a newer Asian fusion style, it's amazing.   The big eye tuna pizza is very good, and the uni is very fresh and high grade. One of the things that stood out the most was the chefs special, which was tuna topped with caviar! Mmmmmmm.

Prices tend to be on the high side and if you sit at the tables facing casino, it can be loud but fun people watching.  Service is great and location in the Bellagio is convenient enough if staying there or just popping in to shop the Bellagio stores and need a bite to eat. Make reservations on weekends as it gets packed.",

The restaurant was almost empty on a monday night and the lighting was so bright, I felt like we were in an upscale diner. The food was above average but nothing exceptional except for the tuna pizza. Yes, the tuna pizza appetizer was really good. The pricing was as you'd expect in Bellagio. Really high for what you get. I would probably go elsewhere when I come back to Vegas. We had (2) different servers because the first one clocked out. Why give us 2 different servers? Doesn't make any sense.",

The Bellagio fountains went off during the start of our meal as we were getting our drinks. It was a stunning cheers moment.  The survive was so helpful and polite. We didn't have to wait very long for our food and the decor was so modern and beautiful. This is my new go to spot when I come to Vegas!",

Chanez informed me that Sous Chef Mayfield personally made my Omakase selection and made it himself.  Quality and the taste was to die for.  Wasn't expecting to see   Foie Gras as a part of Omakase.  However, I am so glad that he included them.  Foie Gras was one of the best I've tasted anywhere.  Not even the best restaurants from Paris could have made this Foie Gras better than Yellowtail.  What can I say about Chanez.... She was great.  She was attentive, professional and friendly.  She bend over backwards to make this Omakase dinner as perfect as possible.  I just can't wait for my next trip to repeat this experience.  Thank you Chanez and Chef Mayfield for making this into a perfect evening.",

Good luck trying to get a drink at the bar in the meantime as that area is even more of a mess and instead of having someone getting drinks for people waiting on a seat they have several people at the hostess stand doing nothing.  As far as the food goes, everything I ordered was very delicious and very well prepared. It was surprisingly loud in the restaurant but that's to be expected in a packed restaurant. The staff was mediocre at best, I had to wait for very long periods to get a drink refill. The busers were more attentive than the wait staff.  Over all the staffing is their biggest issue but the food was outstanding. If you want great sushi but don't mind bland staff, hit this place up.",

Duck prosciutto - even that was just super salty duck without much to bring out it's flavor. Any sushi roll is $15 or MORE for regular sushi. I've eaten at many many sushi places and don't mind spending money on GOOD food but if you're looking to spend money - i would much rather go to Nobu in Vegas.

The music was upbeat and trendy the staff was really good looking but knowledgeable - one might assume they are hired for their looks but every one here knows their shit. My guests arrived and we were promptly seated. Tai snapper, Tuna Pizza, this Octopus Dish with a green sauce (amazing), and some nigiri, and these king crab hand rolls ( my favorite) as well. Ok so they have a sake girl the know what you've ordered and recommends sake for you... BEST THING EVER!! We got WASTED LOL, in a good way. Great view of the Belagio fountains too.        It was a memorable experience. The place is expensive, but I felt it was worth every penny and want to go back for my Birthday this year.   Great Job Yellowtail !!!",

While no particular one was better than the other, I was amazed at Yellowtail's preparation and dipping sauce.  When the plate hit the table, we looked like gremlins after midnight, devouring each piece like it was the last piece in existence.    Rewind to us waiting for our table and them trying to place us facing the smoky and noisy casino. No... $100 later and we're on the outdoor balcony facing the famous bellagio fountains.  That's more like it.    We ordered uni and we were presented with a small portion of nigiri.  After describing that we literally wanted a \"pile of uni\" on a plate, the waiter quickly returned with exactly that.  We scarved that down with smiles until more sushi came out.  I would say the fish was wonderful, fresh, and paced well.    It's not cheap, but it's great if you are in the mood to splurge or if you won some $ at the tables and have extra cash to throw around.  Enjoy!",

Best flavor combination you could ask for. The entire night at the bellagio I debated going back and getting a couple more of these pizzas.   Next I got the lobster carpaccio. Very delicious again but could have used a few more pieces of lobster. After all, $30 for 6 thinly slices of lobster? Let's try and be fair here.   Followed with the Kobe beef tataki. By this point I told my server it had all gone down hill. The sauce was over powering and you could barely taste the beef.   Next I had the ankimo. Fish liver was tasty. No complaints here.   Ended with a toro scallion roll. Needs more toro!  6 pieces od deliciousness but needed more sushi.   Service was good. I asked for a second glass of coke from one of the waiters and never go it.  Oh well.   I would only come back for the tuna pizza.",

I expected to pay a lot, but I didn't expect the food to be this good!  The decor was just in my taste, gold, warm colors, dimmed lights - just a romantic, pleasant atmosphere. Tables aren't too close together, so we had our privacy. LOVED IT!  THE FOOD IS EXQUISITE! I was extremely happy with EVERYTHING we ordered.  Big Eye Tuna Pizza - simply delicate and delicious. The truffle oil was an amazing addition. Baked Crab and Rock Shrimp Hand Rolls - delicious and tender Madlon Sea Salt and Sweet Chili Edamame is a MUST - a very nice twist to edamame! Sake was good as well!  The SERVICE WAS SUPERB! Our waiter was pleasant, cooperative, and attending without hesitation. He was very helpful with any unfamiliar items on the menu.  He truly deserved a big tip!  The bill was a bit pricier than what I usually pay for Japanese, however, it was worth it. Plus for the Bellagio, the prices were considerably cheap!  All in all, this is a must for a nice Vegas dining! You will not be disappointed. I'm definitely making another reservation soon!",

The food was dissappointingly mediocre, with one exception (the miso black cod which was quite good).  I sort of expected that.  What I didn't expect was the horrible service.  The waitress kept leaving the table after taking one persons order without allowing the rest of the party to order their dinner.  We had to keep stopping her and telling her to come back for the rest of the order.  We had only ordered a few appetizers previously so I'm not sure what she was thinking.  We waited 30 minutes for one of our pre dinner drinks and 30 min for a hot tea I ordered after dinner.  She forgot one of our rolls.  And she never seemed the slightest apologetic or embarrassed.  All this at an extremely high price point, even for an upscale sushi restaurant.  It was more than our dinner at Andreas (at the Wynn) the night before.  Terrible experience.",

Also appetizers were brought at the same time as the entree, but that could be a good thing, depending on the person. Portions were small and overpriced, but it is sushi in Las Vegas, so what do you expect? However, the overall service and food was good. Sashimi was small and only 3 pieces for 11 dollars. But the Saba was great, and the lemonade was the best I've ever had. Snapper, yellowtail and eel were all fresh and tender, and the miso was to die for. The soybeans came in 2 ways, salted and put in a sweet chili oil. They were good, and the Japanese pickles were OK. So, this place's food was great (better than the sushi in the buffet), but don't expect it to be filling...or cheap.",

The rolls came out very quickly but no scallops - the waiter said everything on the menu is an appetizer so they just bring out whatever comes up first.  That was weird to me.  The rolls (we ordered three different ones) were just blah, no decoration or sauce on the plate and we had to ask for soy sauce. The whole experience was just meh - our server seemed like he was losing his mind although it was a very slow night in the restaurant.  Someone who may have been the manager did check on us at least three times after the drink incident.  All in all, uninspiring rolls, weak drinks, way too expensive.",

We overlooked the water show of the Bellagio and ate some incredible food thanks to the recommendations from our server.  By the way, the service there is flawless and friendly...our server knew his stuff!  We ate a number of dishes and all were incredible.  I heard about the big eye tuna pizza earlier and was a bit skeptical, but it was only a pizza in the shape and cut of the dish.  The flavors were to die for...I'll be dreaming of that one for a while!!   On the way out, we thought we would ask to pay our compliments to the chef and low and behold out comes this young guy with a huge smile!  The exec. chef Akira Back is such a down to earth, friendly, yet talented, man.  It just topped off our evening the right way.

My husband and I celebrated our 2nd anniversary in vegas and we had dinner here at yellowtail before our cirque du soleil show.  They set up a private table on their small balcony (it could only fit a table for 2) overlooking the fountains.  It was dusk so the lighting was perfect.  The noise was minimal.  We had most of the nigiri on the menu - from hamachi (yellowtail) to toro (tuna belly) to uni (sea urchin).  It's so hard to find fresh uni and yellowtail had the best!  I swear I could taste the ocean, it was so fresh!  The waiter said they had just been flown in from japan (not sure if he this was True but I didn't care b/c it was delicious).

My dude jokes that I'm a cheap date (so I make up for it by ordering multiple drinks...) but anything fishy seems gross to me. He LOVES sushi, so on our little trip to vegas we had to stop here (it was in our hotel) and didn't end up going to Nobu. ANYWAYS. I actually ate sushi and I LOVED IT. not just fish... RAW FISH!? The service was SUPERB, but then the service at the Bellagio was STELLAR, outrageously good. We had a great night and our server even gave us an honest breakdown of the strip joints we should try (we asked!). Everyone was cool, everyone was nice, the service was out of this world. I definitely recommend it, especially if you love sushi, but even more if you're on the fence about it.",

    "text": "Don't try Yellowtail unless you're a high roller with cash to waste. The night started off great, we were seated very quickly considering the size of our party.   My biggest complaint was the lack of attentiveness by servers shown towards our group. The restaurant was about 50% percent capacity but the service was very horrible. Our dishes took forever. It's sushi? how long can it really take? The food was not bad, but it was overshadowed by the horrible service. You would think 25 dollar sushi would come w/ immaculate service. Expensive doesn't equate to great service.   My friend came to the rescue, and made the situation a little better. She spoke w/ management regarding our experience, and the manager admitted, they were hosting high rollers at another table and couldn't properly serve his other guest. He discounted the bill and bought us a round of drinks, but it still didn't make up for the experience. Two stars for the good food and the management for attempting to redeem themselves. Dinner finally ended at 12, and luckily my friend had a table at Tao, so we didn't have to wait.",

    "text": "I can't give it five stars simply because the price was fairly outrageous ($180 with tip for four small plates and a bottle of sake), but man it was the most consistently excellent food I had all week in Vegas!  The star of the show was the walu in tosazu sauce - the best-cooked whitefish I have ever had, in a vinegary and savory broth that I wanted to drink with a straw.  The lobster carpaccio was also a hit with my fiancee, a crustacean nut who gobbled it down happily.  The cilantro was used liberally, which didn't mind me but could be off-putting to those who think it can overpower dishes.  The only dish that I would not have ordered again was the eggplant skewers.  The eggplant itself was nice and meaty, with a good char, but the sweet miso sauce was just way too sticky and sweet for my taste - going with a less sweet, more spicy drizzle (and using less of the sauce) would've made a world of difference!  If you want to splurge with a date in Vegas, make a reservation and be clear you want to get a seat by the window (or outside if it is nice).  They have unparalleled views of the fountains at the Bellagio, and you can get one of the lightest, tastiest meals in Vegas.  Of course, your wallet will also come out lighter too, so perhaps best enjoyed after a lucky day at the slots/blackjack tables!",

I ordered the popping spicy crab from the sushi side of the menu.  It was amazing!  They put pop rocks candy inside the roll!  From the hot side of the menu, I ordered the rock shrimp and the tempura Alaskan king crab.  Both were excellent.  Service was good.  The server was very knowledgeable about the menu and the food took no time to get to our table.  Another great bonus yellowtail offers is their outdoor patio.  The patio sits right on the water where the Bellagio fountains sit and every 15 minutes the fountains go on and display a spectacular water show.  Since I was with my wife, it made our time at Yellowtail very romantic and overall, I had an amazing experience!  I strongly recommend having dinner at Yellowtail if your ever in Las Vegas!",

    "text": "Yellowtail is one of the coolest & most stylish restaurants that I've been in.  The fish tail mural in the front is eye catching.  The interior setting is modern and very posh.  I am a huge fan of sushi and sake.  I'm not a knowledgeable snob; I just know what I like.  * The Fishy Food: The presentation is modern and minimalistic. The Big Eye Tuna Pizza is tasty, but will leave your breath fishy. The sushi was horribly forgetful!  Major letdown.  I had the spicy tuna & some other roll (I forgot).  The ingredients were fresh & tasty, but I've seen conveyor belt sushi with more charm and heartiness. The sake was insanely priced.... however there is a huge selection of high grade sake! Yes, the price was ridiculous for everything ($5 beer = boo) but that's just how it is on the main strip in the big hotels.  * The Service: It took about 10 minutes before the staff prepared an empty lounge table. The waitress was charming, but she wasn't attentive at all. The service had a lot of room for improvement.  * The Setting: I really dig the style of Yellowtail. The outside lounge tables look over the casino floor, where you can be seen as the coolest dork under the Yellowtail sign (or I can at least). The interior is dimly lit, there are some Asian inspired artworks along the walls, and the lounge music sets a nice background.  If I were to return to the Bellagio, I would keep Yellowtail as an option for an expensive drink and a quick bite in a very cool lounge.  Don't go for more than a bite, or you might just end up unsatisfied and cursing the bill.",

If you really want to try the novelty \"pop rocks\" roll I suggest sitting at the bar with a cocktail and just order it as an appetizer before going somewhere else .

Even the oyster sake shooters are sexy. The food is beautifully presented. The baked crab hand roll was amazing! The lady next to us had a bowl that lit up. We are so happy that we spent our post 'O' date night at this place. It was wonderful and we will definitely go back.",

However, their staff is very friendly.

    "text": "Short version: WAY overpriced, tiny portions, bland sushi.  Details: This came highly recommended by a Bellagio employee, who raved about the sushi rolls. I love me some sushi rolls. I eat them at least once a week from various Bay Area restaurants or even markets. I don't have super-high standards... I just want fresh, flavorful, well-crafted rolls that aren't chewy. Well, this place failed on all accounts. Add insult to injury with a hefty price tag (the roll I got was TRIPLE what everywhere else charges for a larger, better roll). Yikes, not happy! It was also supposed to be spicy. Umm, yeah it was after I put a pea-sized amount of their wasabi-like paste on it.  The wine list made no sense for a sushi/seafood restaurant, and again super overpriced.  So, why did I give it a generous TWO stars? The wakame salad was wonderful. Two types of seaweed, delicious sesame dressing, big portion, reasonable price. I should have just ordered that.",

    "text": "For a long time, I had lived in an area without proper sushi so I always make it a point to find a place wherever I travel. Yellowtail had a nice atmosphere with a good view of the fountains, at least from where I was sitting assuming some group of tourist wasn't crowding up the window near my table... sometimes I wonder about people :-) Despite the noisy tourist clamoring for pictures I was able to enjoy some delicious food.   While it might not be the ideal sushi place for a connoisseur it will definitely satisfy. I wasn't in the mood to be picky so I made a deal with the waiter to bring out plates based on my affinity for certain flavors, not to be confused with the Omakase I can't eat that much. Every dish was beautifully put together and delicious. One of my unexpected favorites was the tuna pizza (not sure if that's the actual name). The smokey flavor and slight crunch were perfectly paired, I only wish I wasn't sharing with someone. My only real gripe is that the sake selection is lacking. Otherwise, service is excellent and the atmosphere is nice though it can get a bit noisy.",

We sat at the bar where we were greeted with a smile by our beautiful bartender Kat. She made our experience all the more enjoyable. She made us some delicious cocktails and made suggestions on the menu. We were so glad we listened to her suggestions. Everything was so fresh and flavorful! The tuna pizza was so light and refreshing and the lobster carpaccio was AMAZING! I could eat that everyday!   It's rare that I take the time to write a review but I was so impressed by the food, the cocktails, the atmosphere, but I was especially impressed by the service and attentiveness of Kat. She turned  a four star rating into a FIVE!",

When I was initially searching for venues, I had a lot of difficulty finding a place that could accommodate my group of 18 for the time I needed.  Yellowtail stepped right in, accommodated my event, and did an incredible job of making a recommendation for a tasting menu that would satisfy all palates.  We went with the \"Great Hits\" menu.  Every item on the lineup was even more incredible than the last.  In addition, the service by far exceeded my expectations!  I cannot recommend Yellowtail enough.  This was my first visit, but I will be coming back every time I am in Vegas.",

However, this is really not a sushi restaurant. their cooked food was underwhelming for the price tag (yes the tuna pizza was good) and their sashimi was so so. If you are eating rolls at a sushi restaurant, you dont like sushi either. Being from LA I am spoiled, and I also understand that there is no such thing as an inexpensive sushi meal.

    "text": "No, No, No, No...and No...You've been warned.   Sadly, everything was wrong about this dinner. We made a reservation on Saturday morning for an evening dinner there. We like to do a ton of research and try new places, because well, it is Vegas and there's a jazillion restaurants to try. Frankly money doesn't matter to me (though it is nice to feel like you are getting what you pay for).  If the food, service, and ambience are great, then it is worth it.  I like to leave a place happy and satisfied.  But, on the other hand, if you drop ~$200 (for two mind you) to eat what amounts to nothing (and not remarkable either), then we've got issues.   We arrived for our 6:30pm reservation and were greeted by the hostess(es), who all wear the same tiny black dress with extreme amounts of cleavage baring cut-aways. Being a dude, I don't mind this much, though I will be respectful to my lady and not ogle or point.  I mention this because my girlfriend was appalled by a couple of the girls, and as she \"pointed out\" an Asian hostess seemed to have gotten the wrong size dress because her assets were on display. Not sure how cold it was in there all day, but it was beyond a tit bit nipply for this lady.   My gf was put aback by this at an upscale place.  Strike one for low class wandering exposed boobage.  (As for the decor, location, and the restaurant. It is a dimly lit, very woody feeling, and warm (dark) hues of browns and low orange light. I liked the ambience and decor. This is the one earned star.)   Next up we got seated. Sadly no fountain views were available though I had asked for it...not a big deal. Our server was all hopped up and excited, which can go either way...but she really, really, really was pushing the Big Eye Tuna Pizza appetizer...hard core...so we bit at it much to my dismay (I wanted the Toro) and it was a super thin cracker with way too much truffle aioli on it, and the thinnest slices of tuna ever fashioned. It was \"6 pieces\" but honestly I could have put back 3 or 4 orders of these things for the amount of food an \"appetizer\" should have been.  We were both not impressed.  We also ordered an Organic Field greens salad, a Rock Shrimp (warm plate), the Protein Roll, and the Toro Scallion roll. Also we ordered a two-person pot of hot green tea because it was effing cold in Vegas this past weekend (and even dusted some snow!??!). Quick reviews:  - The Big Eye Tuna Pizza was just a $29 waste...not even tasty (see above). - The field greens salad was acceptable...and simple salads should not be the highlight of one's dinner experience. - The Rock Shrimp were over fried, hard, and just smothered in chili oil. Our local sushi place in LA has a similar dish where the shrimps stay moist, meaty, and the fried batter is a doughy, spicy delight. Here it was like eating rocks. I am being serious...they were so overcooked, I couldn't tell that it was a shrimp dish.  ** Meanwhile our bubbly server is asking us every other minute what we want to order next, we got so frustrated with her constant up-selling, it detracted from \"trying\" to enjoy the food we ordered ** - The Protein roll was okay. I thought the flavors worked. But the portion and roll size were embarrassingly small. 7 disjointed pieces, not symmetrical in cut, super small in diameter...this would NOT have passed for an appetizer, let alone a $32 entree roll. - The Toro Scallion Roll was tasty, but again it was too small, and weak for the asking price.  - Two person serving of green tea is $16. Wow.  I do not ever mind spending my hard-earned money in Las Vegas. I like gambling it away, I like eating it away at nice restaurants, and I enjoy the shows, the comics, and the art work...but I could have rolled up two hundred dollar bills, dipped them in McDonald's ketchup and eaten them, and probably come out more satisfied than Yellowtail.   From hostesses with wandering nipples, to a giddy over-selling waitress, to tiny bites (ha ha small plates...not so much), to dishes that fall flat...save your money and go somewhere else...there's a dozen more sushi joints in town that will impress you.    I give Yellowtail a double Emoji big brown thumb's down!",

Moreover, we had a great seat - our table opened to a private patio on the Bellagio fountain. We would walk out with drinks and watch the fountain show very 30 mins  As for food, it was fine. Again, I'm comparing this to another sushi place within a couple nights. I do recall one dish recommended by the waiter - it was essentially bbq and coleslaw sushi. It sounds horrible, was better than it sounds, but this should simply not be a thing. This is bad fusion. All in all, it was fine and we had a good time.",

We got to see the Bellagio water show every 15 minutes. Our server Berto & food runner Joel were amazing ! Very attentive and had the most wonderful personality.  Wish I could name everything we had, but there is no way. We order lot's of random things and got full very fast. But I will name some of my favorites. -Big Eye Tuna Pizza -Crispy Tofu -Salmon Tiradito -Toro Nigiri -Salmon Nigiri -Popping Spicy Crab roll had PopRocks inside, making it unique.   For dessert, you must get the \"Chocolate in a cup\", it was delicious.  Overall our experience was wonderful.",

She also kept our waters nice and full :) when we ordered sweet shrimp she suggested getting the fried shrimp heads with it which was something I didn't even know was an option so we were really happy about that. She also made a great lychee martini!   We eat a lot of sushi and we're excited to see quality fish on the menu, however the food wasn't very good. The scallop crudo is served with an overwhelming red sauce that totally covered the delicate sweet flavor of the scallop. The sushi was served on cold rice that tasted like it had been out for awhile. The highlight was definitely our botan Aba (sweet shrimp) with the fried heads. We were just in for about an hour before the show so I can't speak to the full sit down experience...it is cool to see the fountains!",

A very clear favorite, and a bite that may have been one of my most memorable in recent times, was of the sushi pizza. Think thin crust pizza, covered in a layer of thinly cut tuna, with truffle oil and a light salting. It was so delicious and unique that we ordered a second. Amazing.   I will look forward to returning on a future trip to Vegas!",

We tried quite a few things on the menu which were all tasty however our favorite items were the Mile High role and the Seared Diver Sea Scallops. The scallops PERFECTLY cooked, just melted in your mouth, that sauce was amazing. We wish we had some bread so sop it all up. The service was informative and attentive to everyone's needs. The restaurant has a front row seat of the water show of Bellagio. I will definitely come back to this place, first stop YELLOWTAIL!",

The view if you get to sit outside is five star and definitely the best part about dinner. The appetizers are underwhelming except the seafood dragon which was grilled seafood with great flavor and aroma. The sushi rolls were below average except the kalbi roll which was delicious. Overall not the most exciting menu. They did get a couple of things right but for that price definitely not something I will back for.   If you like the views and want to take a picture of your wine with the dinner as the fountains play in the background - this is your place. If you are craving some good food - maybe not.",

    "text": "Yellowtail serves up very high quality appetizers and decent soosh in Vegas. Situated in the Bellagio it's a prime location within the hotel.  There are options to even sit on the patio/terrace and watch the fountain show (if you can take in the 105F summer heat). Vegas being Vegas and the fact that it's in a popular Casino means it's on the upper spectrum of the price range.   Here's what we ate for our meal of three people:  1)shisito peppers to start off. They were delicious as an appetizer. Some were mild and some were medium in heat level (this is from a guy who can handle some decent heat). $10  2) big eye tuna pizza- very delicate almost on a church wager type crust and served with truffle oil it was a delicate and delicious appetizer. $27  3) Yellowtail Jalapeno- this was my fave dish of the evening. The yellowtail was super fresh and the drizzle of sauce made plus presentation was artistic exquisite and damm yummy $28  4) various sashimi combo $28 and rolls probably $60- on the ordinary side. Seriously I've had much better.   4) Black Angus Ribeye- $55 very juicy. Sliced thin full flavour but nothing wow amazing. Decently good.   I had a nice Sapporo to wet the whistle and the cocktails I saw being carried around looked decent quality.   Considering dinner was near $300, some items were good but not blow your mind wow amazing. The Yellowtail Jalapeno excellent , big eye tuna pizza was very good. Peppers (hard to screw up) very good. Overall it's a 3.25/5.  I'd be inclined to come here and order some drinks and a bunch of appetizers. This may be a 4/5 kinda time.  Maybe there are other menu items that are more exceptional to what we ordered but expect to shell out a few hundred shekels for a dinner with drinks here.   Service was good. No issues here.",

Therefore, if you practice any etiquette, your food is cold. At the end of the meal, they will not let you split check and our waiter said \"we could work it out\". So we had to do the math and divide the check and taxes ourselves. I will never go to this restaurant again and would discourage others from wasting their money.",

If you want regular sushi rolls, don't waste your time.  Here are the highest recommendations we can offer (and get every SINGLE time): - BIG EYE TUNA PIZZA!!!!!!!!!!!! AMAZINGGG - Seared Albacore - especially if you like onions - Spicy edamame - like I've never had anywhere else  - Braised Kobe Short Ribs  - Happa Roll  - Rock Shrimp - Shrimp lovers delight - Miso Black Cod  The sashimi and many other dishes are outstanding as well, but the above are our HIGHEST recommendations  If you're still hungry, definitely order another tuna pizza!!!! We always do!  To finish it off, for dessert, you MUST have Chocolate in a Cup! Make sure to scoop all the way to the bottom of the cup on your first bite!  Hope this reviews helps you enjoy your visit to Yellowtail, it's my ABSOLUTE favorite!!",

Other \"signature\" appetizer with four tiny little pieces of seared albacore hidden under a canopy of crisp onion? Yep. Downright stingy serving sizes? Take a guess.  I actually had a very enjoyable evening thanks to great company, and I was prepared to feel overcharged given that this restaurant is located inside the Bellagio Hotel. But, if you live in a city that has good sushi (L.A.) you can probably think of 3 sushi bars within 3 miles of your house, have a better meal at each and every one of them, and still have money left over in the end.  To me, sushi is supposed to be an experience in every bite. Yellowtail Japanese Restaurant & Lounge is too bland and too expensive (and the servings embarrassingly small), and will likely disappoint all but the most novice of sushi fans.",

We had miso soup, seaweed salad, oyster shooter, 2 sushi rolls, and 2 cocktails.  The miso soup was fine.  The seaweed salad was weird.  Instead of loose seaweed, they came in tightly rolled balls.  They didn't have as much flavor as I'd liked and the consistency was just strange.  I didn't really like it.  The sushi rolls were rather bland.  And small.  I had a ginger cocktail, which I really liked and my husband had a cucumber martini, which he didn't like.  But at $20 a cocktail, they were rather steep.  I think the bill came out to $175, not including tip.  To me this wasn't a $200 meal.  I've had much better sushi for a third of that price.  I would not recommend this place.",

MORE PLEASE.  Too bad it's so pricy, but what can you do?  It's quasi-fine dining at the Bellagio, it's going to hit you in the pocket.  We did get the fabulous table with a window viewing the fountains at night.  Breathtaking!  We couldn't hear the music, but that was the only downside.  The server was super sweet to me, and some of the people I was with, and straight-up ignored one of my best friends.  I hate to make assumptions, but my friend who was dressed the most plainly (no shiny colors, no glitter, no faux hawk, no bling) got zero attention.  Ordered a drink, never got it.  Had to actually call the waiter back to order food.  Inexcusable.",

    "text": "Yellowtail is by far one of my favorite restaurants on the strip. I agree that the price is definitely a lot higher than your average Japanese restaurant, but aside from paying for the incredible quality of fish, you're mostly paying for the real estate so it's a great place for a date! The ambiance is romantic and ideal for beginning your night out since they have a trendier atmosphere. They're in Bellagio Hotel which is centrally located on the Las Vegas Strip and sits by the lake overlooking the Bellagio fountains.  Also, trust me when I say this... Yellowtail has some of the best servers in the hospitality industry.  Every time I come here, the service is impeccable; personable, knowledgeable and top-notch, worthy of Bellagio.  Roll Call -   *Ahi Tuna Pizza - MY FAVORITE! Thinly sliced grade AAAAA ahi on a light, crisp tortilla with a magical onion and mayo blend, topped with micro greens and...TRUFFLE OIL! I've personally had friends tell me they don't like tuna OR onions OR mayo and then I introduced them to the tuna pizza and BAM! Life-changing.  *Baked Crab Hand Roll - What is up with soy paper? I love anything wrapped in soy paper! And this isn't your typical grossly baked, oozing with burnt mayo roll. The crab itself is baked, I believe. This roll will make you MOL (Moan Out Loud).   *Crispy Kalbi Roll - I don't know how this came to be but it definitely works! I love the texture of this roll - meaty, crunchy (from the slaw), and juicy! It also has complementing temperatures of hot and cold in your mouth!  *Grilled Walu - Of course it's amazing and buttery and just melts in your mouth. Just don't order too many or you may end up on the toilet the rest of the night since Walu is like a natural laxative. You're absolutely fine if you have a few bites and it's worth the small risk since it's fatty and delicious!  And then if you want a fun novelty roll, get the Popping Spicy Crab roll. I'm personally not big on it only because it's a pretty simple roll (crab, asparagus, cucumber) with pop rocks in it but I have to order it whenever I bring someone to Yellowtail for the first time and they always love it!   My 5 O'Clocktail is the Lychee Martini! It pairs wonderfully with everything on the menu & you don't have to love lychee to enjoy this beverage!  Stay classy Las Vegas and thanks for stopping by!",

Two very sorry looking pieces for $15?! Seriously? The slices were as thin as my finger and I wear a size 3.5 ring. I was actually embarrassed FOR them.   Also, the waitress didn't even know what nigiri was. Me: \"2 pieces of the hamachi and sake nigiri please\". Waitress: \"uh nigiri?\". Me: \"yea the sushi on rice\". Waitress: \"ohhhhh sushi on rice.\"   Wow. Wow. Wow.  I haven't written a review on yelp in years, but had to dust off my login to specifically write this one.   To the owners: Please don't make us sushi lovers embarrassed FOR you by serving that kind of nigiri. You guys need to show some respect and slice up some legit pieces. Come on man... You know what you're doing is wrong.",

We shared the king crab appetizer which was delicious and had these yummy little tiny jalapeno peppers. And, because I needed veggies, I had a side order of Brussels sprouts and I would highly recommend these. Very light and tasty. I had wine by the glass (sauvignon blanc) and the service was good. It was also easy to get a reservation.  My main complaints are that it was really loud and really dark. Maybe it's because I'm getting old but I could hardly read my menu and it bothered me. In any case, I'd come here again.",

But like other reviewers have said, it's Vegas, it's Bellagio, and OMG, what an incredible view if you're fortunate enough to sit by the windows facing the exquisite fountains or on the outside patio! Unfortunately, we weren't sitting there, but we had a huge booth, big enough for six, all to ourselves, just two of us!  Service was good, not over the top.  Our waiter was a great photographer, so he gets kudos for the most excellent picture he took!   The specialty drinks are stunning and creative in presentation, heavy on the alcohol by my standards, but expensive - $20 for one martini!  Loved the Lychee martini!  The food is fresh, inspired, and pretty!  We had the Big Eye Tuna Pizza.  I could have eaten two of them by myself.  It really isn't a pizza at all, but an artfully covered cracker with plenty of tuna accented by shiso and truffle oil. To get my daily dose of veggies, we ordered the grilled eggplant skewers which were covered in miso and sesame. It was sweet and good enough for dessert.  We had to try the Popping Spicy Crab Roll, the claim to fame being the addition of pop rocks (remember those?) amongst a more traditional crab, asparagus and cucumber roll.  We were expecting an explosion of sorts on our mouths but it was actually very subtle and sweet on the finish. It didn't wow us like we thought it would, but it was still a delicious roll.  Yellowtail is really all about the combination of atmosphere, service and food, and it was a great experience!  Next time, we might try sitting in the lounge area that faces the casino as you get a prime spot for people watching as the throngs of people come through Via Bellagio! That's entertainment!",

Without receiving a menu or disclosure of how much the food would be was so ridiculous. Once we talked to a \"manager\" we did NOT receive the service we thought we came for.

Yellowtail was not a contender for a 5 star but do no let that disuade you from hitting it up.  The food was VERY good and things like the edamame with sweet spicy chili sauce were new and very good to me.  I thought it interesting that they have a Nobu staple (popcorn shrimp in spicy sauce) on the menu.  I ordered 4 of these for the table and they were gone in 3 minutes (they should be eaten hot anyway).  I ordered more and they too were gone.   We ordered some sushi rolls that were fantastic including the first lemon zest I have ever had in a Maki Sushi.  It was a special and tasted like a perfect summer happy hour roll.  So good...  Anyway the one guy that didn't like sushi was happy with his $50 Kobi beef.  Seaweed salad was fantastic and ample/fresh.  The Ahi nachos rocked too.  You will not be dissappointed here but bring money like at every non-buffet in Vegas.  Again, this place was built for the expense account.  Cheers. T",

My fiance was taking a couple of his business partners here and I decided to come along because I'm a huge sushi fan.   Not impressed!  I guess I'm not a fan of fancy sushi.  Here is a list of what I ordered:  Spicy miso $8  Baked crab $10  California $17 Kobe beef flat iron $42   Miso was good I like the little kick it had from being spicy, the baked crab was good but not great the crispy onions they put in it were overwhelming all I tasted was onions, the California roll was good but how can you mess that up and the Kobe beef was ok. Overall the food was good but nothing special.   What I really enjoyed was the atmosphere really dark and romantic and the view was amazing since its inside the Bellagio you had a close view of the water show which was nice.  I see in a lot of people's reviews their complaining about the prices all I have to say to that is I agree the food is not worth the cost but its worth the experience. The atmosphere, view and service was well worth the  $400 something dollar bill.  Also the food presentation was very nice as well I didn't take any pics because that is very tacky to do at a place like this.   So overall it was a good experience, but I think I'll stick to my small hole in the wall sushi joints.",

Was the sushi chef on a binge?  The green tea was $8 a pot...get the picture?  The check was $75!  It's shocking the Bellagio has such an inferior sushi bar.  I don't care how much they pay for a fish.  It's not showing in the presentation of the sushi.  How do they stay in business!  Our server was excellent.  The decor lovely.  But, the alligator covered chairs were worn and in need of refurbishing.",

    "text": "Well, we got back to Vegas and all last week I've been dreaming of the pop rock sushi at Yellowtail.  So, finally, we got our chance and headed over for dinner.  Well, the Popping Spicy Crab was great!  There is just something about the spicy flavors and the pop rock surprise as you eat it.... we ended up ordering more.  We had a few other things also, like the soft shell crab sushi roll which was good, but not special.   The Alaskan Snow Crab Tempura which was really good, the crab was tender and the tempura was crunchy, served in a bowl with a nice ponzu sauce, it was lovely.  We also tried the Big Eye Tuna Pizza, and it was good, I especially liked the truffle oil, it really worked.  The sommelier helped us pick out several different beers to go with the meal, we had fun with the Japanese beers she recommended.   All in all, a great meal.",

    "text": "I've been to Yellowtail a few times, including twice in the past month.  My experience has been great every time.  Both times I recently went we sat right next to a window overlooking the Bellagio fountains and the food and service were both phenomenal.    I've had the edamame, big eye tuna pizza, the Alaskan king crab tempura, the popping spicy crab aka pop rocks roll, and the filet mignon toban.    The sweet chili that was added to the edamame made it very delicious.  The big eye tuna pizza is a dish that is an absolute must try.  It's difficult to describe the burst of flavor when you bite into it a piece, but it's excellent.  The crab tempura was fried to perfection and went really well with the sauces they served it with.  The spicy crab roll was unique because of the pop rocks they add to it.  The filet mignon melted in my mouth.  I also had a dessert that was made from nutella that was amazing.  I don't remember what it was called (dessert in a cup maybe?), but I would recommend it as well.  The overall quality of the food is good enough to justify the price you pay for it.    I would definitely call in advance and make a reservation.  Also, a lot of people dress up to eat here, but the atmosphere and vibe is laid back and relaxed enough that you can wear relatively casual attire and not feel under-dressed.",

It came in two different flavors and I absolutely loved the sweet chili one! Their miso soup was also pretty good. They had two or three different types of miso soups.   I gave four stars instead of five because I didn't find any unique sushi rolls for me to try.  Kumi is the sister restaurant of Yellowtail, and i gave that restaurant a 5 star! Definitely try Kumi",

    "text": "Happy Bday to me! A friend took me and the family along to indulge ourselves into this exquisite experience of...OMG delicious eats.  I really was begging them to stop because I couldn't eat any more food.    The appetizer that you must try is their Big Eye Tuna Pizza, mmm it was drizzeled with Truffle oil.  Oh my that was yummy.  I also got to sample the rock shrimp, and the Duck Prosciutto.  I love proscuitto, but the duck prosciutto was a bit on the saltier side, but again, it is duck.  Oh another that was delicious was the kobe beef tataki, man that literally melted in my mouth. Oh My, my tummy just started growling for that.  LOL, I don't think I can finish this review without re-living the experience again.  For some sushi we tried the Popping Spicy Crab roll, a favorite that my brother enjoyed.  I devoured the Toro sushi, what was in the platter, went all in my tummy.  We had a platter that had a variety of fish.  If you are eating here, I don't have to go in details of what I ate, but you won't be disappointed.  Toro, for sure, that was a must for sushi.   Okay seriously, I am not done.  We still had more food to be served.  Main courses brought on the Kobe Beef Flat Iron and Jidori Chicken.  They both were cooked to perfection, the yummy goodness that melted in your mouth had me saying MmmMm, so good, but so full, I can't even eat more of it :(.     For dessert we finished off with a ginger flan and chocolate lava cake paired with lychee sorbet.  I mananged to get at least a bite out of both of them, and they were yes, like the rest of my review, YUM.   I can't wait to return, I'm coming back with an empty stomach.  The whole staff was very pleasant.  BTW, the seating of this restaurant also overlooks the water fountain, oh you know, just icing on the cake at this place.   Thanks Yellowtail for this awesome experience in my mouth, my tummy thanks you!",

Located inside Bellagio, if you reserve seats outside, you will have a nice view of the Bellagio Fountains (which performs every 15 and 30 minutes). The place is elegant for dinner, dimly lit, and loud with the sounds of other table guests. Our reservations were for 9pm, but was seated around 9:30pm, so just be cautious about time if you are on a schedule.  This is what we ate: 1. Big Eye Tuna Pizza $26 - thin crust on the bottom and tuna on the top, good to share, and definitely should try if you never had it before. 2. Grilled Eggplant Skewers $12 - sweet miso sauce with sesames, soft mushy eggplants. I would pass on it to try other things. 3. Popping Spicy Crab Roll $16 - House recommendation, actual pop rocks within the roll, very interesting, a must try!  We also ordered a bottle of sake, there are lots of selections. You can also grab a beer or glass of wine.  Service was attentive, they came back a few times to see if we needed more sake, more food, and filled up our glasses of water. I left feeling pretty good, and would come back for another nice dinner occasion.",

I still can smell the old oily smell of the crisp. Then tuna roll, protein roll, steak. none was good. very disappointing. Not to mention that the price was unreasonably high. I asked for a cucumber avocado roll. I was charged for cucumber roll plus 3 dollar for avocado and additional 3 dollar for \" inside out\" which means in cucumber roll the rice is inside the seaweed  ( seaweed paper is the outer layer) but now that they added avocado they had to have the rice outer layer and that cost 3 $ additional to price of cucumber and avocado!  I also asked for side of rice with steak which I was charged additional 3 dollar for bowl of rice ( which make sense ) and another 3$ to serve the rice in a bowl!! and I have to add the quality of steak was close to what you eat at fast food places and the steak was cooked completely bloody even I requested well cooked and I specifically asked the server's opinion ordering that for my kids, which he recommended! Too many people standing nice and clean doing nothing!",

We started with the edamame which was actually quite good.  The sweet chili edamame was addicting.  Next came the Tuna Pizza.  Based on the reviews and pictures I was expecting something incredible.  It was like a thin wafer with one thin slice of tuna across the top.  Looked premade too.  We had the Rock Shrimp which was ok, too lemony though. @Andreas at Encore has better.  The Protein roll was just ok.    As a local we had been meaning to try Yellowtail...now we can say, been there, done that.  Disappointing.",

Also the creamy spicy rock shrimp dosent dissatisfy. It's nice with a nice touch of spice. Also for the main rolls we ordered angry salmon which is a spicy salmon garlicky roll. Secondly we ordered rock shrimp hand roll this roll wasn't the extraordinary but it was ordinary. For tempura lovers there is a tempura roll that is amazing. Lastly we ordered an amazing roll that is a spicy tuna roll. The spicy tuna was by far the best roll on the menu and I high reccomend it. It is very spicy though so If you don't love spicy this isn't for you but my family and I love spicy so this roll was a home run. The service is ok not the best but decent in the beginning it was amazing but towards the end not so much. But either than that it's a home run.",

    "text": "I really feel the need to review Yellowtail solely on the service of one of their hostesses on the night of Saturday, 5/17/15.  I had booked a reservation to celebrate an anniversary on their patio a week in advance.  On the taxi ride to the restaurant, I called to let them know that we were running a little bit late.  I was told that there was no reservation under my name, and when she looked up my OpenTable confirmation number, it showed that it was booked for the previous night (Friday), and that the restaurant was fully booked, especially for the coveted patio seating.  I was floored at myself for the mistake; we were so excited to try Yellowtail and experience their beautiful patio overlooking the Bellagio fountains.  I asked to just put my name down in case something opened up, and perhaps we would just dine at the bar.  We checked in, were told that it was a realistic wait of an hour and a half, and proceeded to order a few drinks and appetizers at the bar.  Maybe 20-30 minutes passed by, and the hostess that I spoke to over the phone approached me at the bar and said she was able to get me a table on the patio, saying she \"knew she had to do something for me\" after speaking to me on the phone.  I really appreciated the hospitality, especially since it clearly was my mistake on booking a table for the wrong night.  The patio table and view of the Bellagio water show were divine.  I have no words to describe the amazing ambiance, and truly can't compare it to any other view while dining.  If you dine here and the weather is nice, I would try to get a table out here.  The food was a bit mediocre for the pricing, though I feel like it was justified by the patio experience.  The only dish that really stuck out was my boyfriend's Surf & Turf ($115).  The sauce on the lobster was so delicious, and both the proteins were cooked to perfection.  I ordered the Hirame Ikejime ($30), which was just OK.  Hirame is one of my favorite fish eaten raw, but nothing wowed me.  I also ordered the Seared Foie Gras ($45), which was again, OK, and a very tiny portion for the price.  There was nothing special about our miso soups ($8 for a regular, and $9 for spicy).  The spicy version just tasted like they added few dashes of Tabasco.  All in all, the scenery made it all worth it (I know, I can't stop talking about it).  Service was great.  He didn't mention anything about it being our anniversary, but I was already highly appreciative of the fact that the hostess got us a table.  This is a great experience to celebrate a romantic evening!",

We could see part of the shows from where we were seated inside. The hostess was a hot mess and not very welcoming or polite- in fact she seemed a bit unsure and uncomfortable. Our waitress was very nice and had excellent recommendations. The wait for both our drinks and food was quite a bit. Our waitress apologized and kept checking in, but you could tell the wait staff we slightly taxed. And we overheard another table complaining about being forgotten to management. We got the Alaskan king crab tempura- dear god that dish is amazing! One of the best I've ever tried! The Angry salmon roll was decent. Miso soup was good, and the red Zinfandel that was recommended was also quite good. That being said the price was too high for the small portions, slightly above average sushi, wait time, and fail on seating. Our price was $97 for 2 people- including a discount rate we got due to attending a conference in Vegas. I'd recommend it if you're going for the crab tempura- but get 1 for each person! And at $45 a plate it won't fill you up.  Lots of opportunities for this place to Improve!",

    "text": "The food was pretty good, but our service was so appalling I had to take off three stars.  We go to Yellowtail on a friend's recommendation. It's myself, 7 other students, and a professor in town for a convention. After a lot of deliberation our waiter suggests letting him order, saying it'll be a good way to try the menu as well as making the price reasonable for us. He asks for our preferences so he can understand our tastes, and two of the students say they like California rolls - which should indicate to him their tastes are pretty basic.   We get one round. Four plates, all different, and share. It's kind of cool we think. Then another round comes out, two orders of two items. Then another. And another. Progressively going up the menu.   After about our 5th round the waiter tells us everything he ordered is in and now we just need to wait for the rest to come out. After this, two orders of a $60 dish come out. Then more rolls. Then two orders of a $130 dish come out. At this point, everyone is full and wondering why this waiter has ordered us so much food. Food that some people can't even enjoy because it's too eclectic for their tastes. Another order comes out. Then another, four rolls that are barely touched because everyone is so full.   We've barely touched that order before the next thing comes out. Luckily someone says \"No. We're done eating.\" Afterwards our waiter comes over, leans into the ear of the girl who organized our dinner and somewhat snarkily says \"Just so you know... Well, nevermind.\" And walks off. Then we get the bill.  Our bill is about $1300 and our waiter has guaranteed himself about a $200 tip because of the automatic gratuity placed on tables of 8 or more.   Our server took advantage of us. He knew we were young students. He knew we were indecisive about our tastes. He knew that amount of food was way too much. And yet, he put in at least 11 courses of food, possibly more.   Why wouldn't he place 3 courses, ask if we would like more of what we had or if he's matching our tastes, then continue? Why would he place THAT MANY orders at once?  The service here completely ruined my faith in Yellowtail. Between being shoved in the back and having to wait forever to get refills on drinks and our experience with a waiter who knew he ordered too much food that was too expensive for a group of 20-22 year olds and a professor, likely because of an automatic gratuity, I don't know if I can return. If your waiter is a tall man with glasses and closely cropped hair, do not let him order for your group.  If, despite reading how they treat their customers, you decide to est at Yellowtail anyway, give the tuna pizza a try. That and a few other dishes are slightly redeeming qualities of this restaurant, but I'll never forget the way their staff abused the trust of myself and my peers.",

The portions got smaller and Im ok with that its just that its not as good as before. Bellagio is till my fav hotel.  The staff is always helpful and nice. The cost is astronomical.... Im looking for a new sushi bar in Vegas.",

If you go there, request a patio seat so you can watch the fountain show, it was a great view.  The server was amazing! He was very nice and professional, and yet he had so much personality! He made amazing recommendations and was attentive all night regardless of being very busy. Best waiter I've ever had.  The food was phenomenal! Everything tasted amazing, I've never had anything like it. I was astounded. I tried a lot of things and everything was perfect. We had the house sake and a few different years of the Macallan scotch, both amazing. My favorite drink was the desert sake called Banzai Bunny. It was a sweet sparkling sake, a perfect finish to the meal.  The music and atmosphere were perfect. I've never enjoyed the music in a restaurant so much, it was mostly very ambient and relaxing, yet slightly up beat remixes of popular songs played at the perfect volume. The tables were set wonderfully and the entire restaurant was beautiful.  The overall experience at this restaurant was wonderful, my boyfriend and I were both extremely impressed and will be back again! Thank you Yellowtail for the great experience!",

    "text": "Definitely not my usual price point for sushi... I'd rather go to a steakhouse or something for the same amount of money.  That being said, the ambiance was pretty nice.  The decor was dark and sleek, and our server was decent (he did forget to bring us tamari, but other than that, great).  We could also look out the window and see a little bit of the Bellagio fountain show, and it was neat to see it from inside the building.  I also liked the sommelier.  She was able to take two different wine preferences (dry vs. \"sweet!  I like Moscato!\") and recommend something in the middle that would appeal to both types of palates (still a little too sweet for my liking, personally, but a good compromise).  We shared the seared diver sea scallops (\"mustard potato puree, cherry tomato\").  These scallops were cooked very nicely and were garnished with a smear of the potato puree, which was too sweet, and a roasted cherry tomato.  The only thing was... there were two scallops.  They were 1.5 inches in diameter and had been cut in half so that there would be four pieces arranged delicately on the plate.  For $23, I think at least one more scallop would have been nice.  Next up was the popping spicy crab roll (\"cucumber, asparagus, pop rocks\").  Umm, it had pop rocks in it.  How could we not resist?  This was really fun to eat and actually worked a lot better than I expected.  We also ordered the unagi roll (\"cucumber, sesame seeds, eel sauce\").  Eel is always good and this was no exception.  These rolls were all a bit on the small side though.  Actually, I could have eaten the scallops and the rolls on my own, and then I would have been full.  But that would have cost me $50+.  Overall, I wouldn't choose to come here, but this was a nice place for a group of friends to chill and drink some wine (marked up from $20 to $55).  Such is my experience with Vegas... I don't gamble.  Instead, I lose a lot of money whenever I dine out, haha.",

But this Another example of a Restaurant that doesn't understand customer service and trying to price gauge their customers.  I have visited this restuarant on occasion when I am here for business trips ,and I order the same exact thing ,only this time they tried to up charge me and make money on the side for something as simple as yellowtail. Shame on you Yellowtail,what a horrible display of unprofessionalism . I  just over it ,what a way to ruin your customers or should I say former customers weekend .",

I ordered an \"entree,\" which was the Kobe Beef Flat Iron. I'm not much of a fish eater, but my wife is. Anyway, my entree come out and it looked more like an appetizer with a splat of potato puree. I'm a high metabolism carnivore and this was a huge disappointment for me, especially at $48!  My wife got two sushi rolls. She liked them, but again, they were extremely expensive. We spent about $130 and were hungry about 3 hours later.   The service was extremely slow, which is frustrating when your hungry and in vegas.",

    "text": "~High end sushi at a higher end price.  Check out my full review with helpful photos here: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fasupr.us%2Fap-yellowtail&s=04825093ae119dc7987f762307b4a2ae7b5ee271a7d3220f05164600e771f0ae\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">asupr.us/ap-yellowtail</a>  Yellowtail is quite the luxurious setting which is quite fitting considering the fact that it's within the grand Bellagio casino.  The decor was upscale, but trendy at the same time.  In addition to the extravagant decor inside Yellowtail, you're also spoiled with an absolutely breathtaking view of the famous Fountains of Bellagio.  First off, I acknowledge that eating at Yellowtail comes with a premium.  And I already expected the increase in price from eating in Boston compared to eating in Vegas.  With those two factors in mind, I still found the prices a little on the high side.  Normally I'd be fine with paying a premium for high quality sushi, but for the price in Vegas and the sushi I got... I felt like the price I was paying was more for the surroundings and the location.  I found the dishes to be on the smaller size, but it's all about quality, not quantity.  Still would have liked to get a little more bang for my buck. Here are some of the rolls I tried:  Big Eye Tuna Pizza - Micro Shiso, Truffle Oil Simply put, this thing is amazing and unique.  It's a stark contrast from the soft delicious tuna and the crunchy pizza crust.  It just all worked, very clean flavors.  Kobe Beef Tataki - Spicy Daikon, Garlic, Maldon Sea Salt The Kobe Beef is cut paper thin, but it's the combination with the crunch of the garlic and the sea salt that makes this dish a sure winner.  Melts in your mouth.  Tai Snapper - Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Shiso, Tosazu The extra virgin olive oil makes this dish divine.  The slight peppery taste gives the snapper a nice little kick.  Excellent stuff.  Toro Scallion Roll - Blue Fin Tuna Belly, Green Onion On the small side, but a classic combination.  Fish was nice and fresh, rice was perfect.  Nothing special, just very solid.  Popping Spicy Crab Roll - Cucumber, Asparagus, Pop Rocks Amazing and unique roll.  Yes, the description does say Pop Rocks.  Most unique roll I may have ever had.",

Cons: the bill was a bit pricy, but it's Bellagio so it was expected  Pros: delicious variation of fish, staff was very attentive. Our server Tammy was amazing and made the everything even better.

Between my other half and I, we ordered a couple of small plates and rolls and one entree to share. I'd say some were unique and delicious. The pop rock roll, oyster shooter, and big eye tuna pizza are a must. But otherwise I wouldn't spend so much money on Japanese food. Definitely overpriced.",

I have posted up some pictures of the food we had.  Even the executive chef Akira (who was also on Iron Chef) came out to greet us. He was very nice and funny. We had a great table on the patio that has the best view of the Fountain show of Bellagio. We were very lucky.  Definitely would recommend this restaurant!",

The portion is so small it must have been meant for an elf.  My friend had the Chilean sea bass, and she was not happy with it.  She said the fish tasted like it was spoiled.  The portion was also elf-size, but definitely not the price.

Very much not to the standard of Bellogio casino this restaurant service and food  should get better to the 5 star rating or should close down.",

I need to add the comment about the service... was wonderful!!! We had a great time with their kind services and smiles. I would love to visit again whenever I could stop by Las Vegas!",

Surprisingly, yes, the chicken.  It was the last entree, and one bite was so tender & moist, we couldn't resist our stuffed silly selves.  my stomach wanted to explode like a ticking time bomb, and wait... there's more.  a ginormous dessert platter, i nearly lost my ability to breathe.  luckily i savored more than i sweet, so after a few bites, i was able to.. slowly....put...down...the....spoon....... easy there.  decadence knows no boundaries!",

The spicy tuna roll was not spicy enough and tasteless and also the negitoro roll has a lot of muscle in it and also i bite tuna scale inside of roll. Tuna scale was sharp almost cut my tongue.

We got a table outside right in front of the fountain and it made our night.   Food is descent. They move a lot of people through there in a night so the service is a little rushed but friendly and generally fun.

I started the experience with a Plymouth martini with bleu cheese hand-stuffed olives.  (The real deal!)  Not only can Casey, the bartender, make a great drink, but also give great food recommendations.  He raved on the Big Eye Tuna Pizza and it did not disappoint.  It was incredible!  I also had the Seared Diver Sea Scallops.  Next, I wanted to venture into a dish that featured the namesake of the restaurant.  Upon asking for another recommendation, James (another bartender), readily suggested the Yellowtail Jalapeno option.  Delightful!  Rounding out the evening was the succulent Scottish Salmon.  Pricey evening but . . . I'm worth it.   I will return when in Vegas next.",

The service in general from our waitress was bad.  The waitress who was \"waiting\" on our table couldn't care less.  I used to work in the service industry.  The trick to get a good tip is to give updates to your customer regardless if it is busy or not.  Some of these people don't realize that a tip is actually based on their service and is not a requirement.  In the end, management asked us \"are you sure that you didn't get your order???\"  Terrible.  Someone f***ed up on their team, yet we were question.",

Also threw in salmon roe sushi, which was good.  What really made the evening, however, was the outdoor patio seating overlooking the Bellagio fountains, so that every 30 minutes we would be treated to a music choreographed fountain display.  Really a great dining experience.  Highly recommend.  I will definitely go back next time I visit Vegas.",

Everyone seems to rave about the tuna pizza so we decided to give it a go. It was a total disappointment. It lacked flavor and was definitely not worth the $27 dollars. We ordered two more appetizers which were only okay.  Then the rolls came out. They were good but definitely not worth the price.  Overall, I wouldn't go back.

Our group has a diverse and varied palate and she made lots of menu suggestions to accommodate everyone's different tastes. Some delicious highlights: Big Eye Tuna Pizza (can I eat this every day tho?), Tempura Alaska King Crab (so good!), Protein Roll, Rib Eye Steak cooked to perfection, and Chocolate in a Cup and Apple Harumaki for dessert to top it all off. She also paired some fabulous cocktails and sake with our dishes. Everything was coursed out perfectly and absolutely delicious!  I also want to thank the friendly and accommodating GM, Keith. He knew we were celebrating a very special birthday and seated us next to the balcony, so we were treated to incredible views of the Bellagio fountain during our dinner. He checked in on us multiple times throughout the evening to make sure we were enjoying ourselves.  We couldn't have asked for a better experience - from the food, to the impeccable service, and welcoming staff. Thank you Sarah and Keith for a lovely evening! We will definitely come back the next time we visit Vegas.",

The Big Eye Tuna Pizza is one of the most memorable food items I've ever had in terms of flavor! Delicious! The Black Miso Cod was also unexpectedly light, moist, and amazingly flavorful! The wife enjoyed the Sunset cocktail where the drink is fresh and delicious.   Overall, you cannot go wrong dining here!",

Our server (I feel horrible I forgot her name) was awesome, recommended the Big Eye Tuna Pizza to start with. It was amazing, I ordered another appetizer and a few rolls for the table however the Tuna Pizza was the one thing that left an impression on us. After our delicious dinner the manager overheard it was my parents anniversary so he sent over complimentary glasses of champagne. Overall the food was spot on and the service was top notch. I would absolutely recommend this restaurant if you are looking for a nice Japanese meal.",

The waitress promptly took my order and then I didn't see her again for 15 minutes. When I got her attention I reminded her that I was still waiting for a drink. 5 minutes later I got my drink. I waited another 20 minutes for the first of the  2 sushi rolls that I ordered.  I had the Filet Mignon Toban and Red Dragon. Both rolls were average and I was clearly paying a significant markup for location. The rolls came out about 15 minutes apart. Overall I was very disappointed with the quality of the dining experience and would not recommend for service or food.",

They were actually on the food network for their crab. The sushi is very fresh and all the other food I had (rock shrimp tempura, Chilean sea bass, and ankimo) were all delicious. The restaurant is expensive, but the location is why. Food is great too. Would recommend going.",

    "text": "While my girlfriend and I were in the Bellagio waiting for the performance of \"O\", we decided we would stop and eat at one of the many restaurants in the Bellagio floor. We had already eaten the Buffet, so we narrowed it down to the four or five remaining restaurants. Yellowtail had the shortest line, and I had been in the mood for sushi for a few days, so we stopped in. The setting is very intimate, very cool. There's a small section inside next to the bar, a few tables spread throughout the restaurant, and a few tables on a deck looking out over the casino floor. We were seated immediately, and the service was outstanding. Very, very beautiful hostesses and servers took care of us all night long. Had a few different rolls and a few orders of sashimi. The pace of the meal was pretty good, as we got our drinks and soup immediately, then slowly started receiving the rolls and sushi as the meal went on. It was at a good enough pace where you could eat and enjoy the meal, yet not have huge plates covering the table, spread out every which way. Overall, the quality of the sushi was very good, and the taste was great also.  For the restaurant, I was going to go with three stars. The food was good, but I've had better sushi at many local restaurants throughout the country, and it was WAY cheaper. The price of this restaurant certainly doesn't reflect the taste, although it was good, just not for the price. The service definitely knocked it up to four stars, however. Our waitress was exceptional, and the entire meal was very relaxing and enjoyable. Overall, I would recommend this place to anyone looking for sushi on the strip, as it probably won't get any cheaper unless you go somewhere else in Vegas. Definitely enjoyed the experience, and I would probably stop here again.",

The rolls were well executed and not overly prepared or slathered in sauces. The fish was very fresh and presentation wasn't over the top - which I like.  Personal favs: - the edamame, I really like the sweet & spicy version (they bring two types, traditional and sweet & spicy) - Strawberry roll, hadn't had a roll with fruit in/on it before and this was a nice treat, plus the strawberries still had bite to them - Popping Crab Roll, a new take on the traditional crab roll with Pop Rocks in it, odd but addictive  Overall, my wife and I thoroughly enjoyed the experience. It is something we will definitely remember from our trip to Vegas and can't wait to get back to visit Yellowtail again.",

The restaurant is pretty intimate and cozy (kinda dark with light music in the background).  If I had to do it over again, I would recommend making reservations to sit outside on the balcony.  On the balcony, you would have a full view of the Bellagio Fountains playing while you eat.  We learned of this AFTER we sat down.  Next time! 2.  Service - so so, they were quite busy and a lot of the waiters took their time.  However, I must admit that the hostesses are incredibly attractive...LOL... my wife gave me a few angry looks..lol.. oh well. 3.  We all ordered the set menu.  It is a 7 course fish.  By the way, quality is key here.  Funny thing, after our 4th dish, we jokingly mentioned that we may have to swing by the In and Out Burger joint to get a filling.  However, the 5th to 7th course is a bit heavier and actually made us full. As for the food, I would highly recommend the sliced Halibut , the yellowtail/salmon/tuna salad, and the Kobe Medallion beef.  Wow.  We capped it off with green tea ice-cream... very good. Drinks are kinda cool.  They have their own variations of mixed drinks. 4.  Price -- extremely pricey.  Usually reserve for special occassions. 5.  Dress code - we were a bit surprised that it was not more of a dressy crowd.  We saw a few jeans and several in shorts.  For an upscale restaurant, we thought it was a bit odd... I guess you are on the strip.  My wife and I planned to return again.  It was a great experience.",

If you've ever been to Nobu, the menu is very similar. The food was really good, and you're not supposed to go and order just one entree and be done. I definitely recommend the rock shrimp, kobe beef tataki, and the yellowtail serrano. The spicy tuna specialty roll was really disappointing, and I didn't really like it. Also, the edamame comes in two different ways: the regular plain way with sea salt and then with thai chili or something which was just okay. I was also not impressed with the dessert menu, so we didn't get any. I also got hot tea, which was $8..!!   The ambience was fantastic. The restaurant was beautiful, but a little smaller then I expected. It was rainy and windy that day, so the balcony was closed, but we got a seat right next to the window so we could see the Bellagio fountain show very easily.   As for the service... I didn't really like our server. I felt like he was ignoring us and rushing to get away when we were trying to talk or ask for something.   All in all, I would definitely go here again when I have some extra money to splurge on dinner.",

    "text": "My sister and I lucked out on all accounts when dining at this wonderful restaurant.  We ordered a wide variety of sushi and specialities to include the hamachi that melted in our mouths, the tuna pizza (someone else posted a pic) with truffle oil that was interesting and every bite delightful, and the baked crab hand roll that was a party in the mouth.  Everything we ordered was exceptional.  The waitstaff and service was exactly what one would expect from this place,--prompt, helpful, attentive, exact.  The various choices are expensive, but considering we had pretty close to a perfect experience, one doesn't mind forking (or chopsticking in this case) out the dough.  I highly recommend this restaurant.",

Both dishes tasted good but not THAT good.  Our bill was over $200 because we kept ordering food so we could feel like we actually ate something. My suggestions: Eat before you go, or drink lots of alcohol while you are dining so you won't notice the child-like portions with the adult price tag.",

The atmosphere is like a nightclub, the music was loud and terrible, and it was extremely dark.  Putting all of that aside, the food was mediocre at best.  The sauce that the tofu came with tasted exactly like Oriental Ramen broth.  The rolls were extremely small and had minimal flavor, the edemame was adequate although half of it was overcooked.  I think their slogan on the business card said it all:  \"Yellowtail - Barely Adequate\"",

The menu, sushi, specialty rolls, and drink options are really not very good (and that's understating the quality of the food.)  The rolls were very small and totally overpriced ($17 for a California Roll which was nothing special).  We had four rolls, one beer and some edamame and spent over $120.  The service was pleasant, but the order took too long to get to us.  With all the options for sushi in Vegas, we will Not be returning to Yellowtail.",

As for the rolls, their signature roll is a strawberry roll...its just strawberry on top of a spicy tuna roll...maybe I'm just conservative, but I would eat the roll without the strawberry. I would go back if I wanted a cheap place to eat at Bellagio.",

    "text": "I'm a bit of a sushi snob, so when I heard that the Bellagio was finally getting into the game, I was definitely intrigued. Didn't get a chance to try it until now, and the results aren't impressive...  The wait wasn't too bad; around 10 minutes for 5 on a Saturday night so a few members of our party decided to go play some blackjack while they waited. While they were gone, we were seated and placed our drink orders. A few moments after our entire party returned, yet neither the waitress nor the sake attendant could be bothered to acknowledge their arrival or take their drink orders. Pretty tacky...  The service didn't get much better from there. Sake came quickly, but anything from the bar took way too long without any explanation. When we finally ordered our food, our waitress missed two of the items, most of our 2nd round of drinks and then checked in on us very infrequently. I suppose to her credit, she admitted her shortcomings and offered us a free dessert, but it would have been nicer had she just been on her game from the beginning.   The food wasn't much better. Sushi was an embarrassment. Ordered a lobster roll; the lobster was alright, but the mango was nowhere to be found and the roll was simply too small to justify the price. The toro was nowhere near as delicious as toro should be and I'm not sure there was actually any wasabi on the nigiri.   The hot food does deserve a little praise. The rock shrimp in a korean chili sauce was very tasty, although the sauce made the shrimp on the bottom of the bowl a bit soggy.  The kobe tartar and kobe filet were the highlights of the meal, but again...way too small for nearly $40 a plate.  I'm aware it's the Bellagio, so obviously things are going to be a bit higher then an off-strip place, but that's not an excuse to rip people off and you better have your execution down. This wasn't the case at all, so it deserves no more then two stars. If you're on this part of the strip looking for good sushi, I'd recommend Sushi Roku across the street at Caesars.",

My wife made reservations online for Yellowtail and I was at first skeptical about high-priced sushi but after eating there, we were both pleasantly surprised.  The ambiance, service and food were nothing short of excellent.  We were seated next to the big windows and had a great view of the fountains.  Our waiters were very helpful in suggesting \"what's good to eat\" there and they did not disappoint.  Among our favorite dishes, we enjoyed the Kobe Beef Tataki, the Tempura Alaskan King Crab and the Unagi & Banana Roll.  While we spent about $200 on our meal we enjoyed every penny of it!  We definitely will visit Yellowtail again the next time we are in Vegas.",

Thank goodness it was my birthday dinner so I got my wish! We ended up at Yellowtail in the Bellaggio. The staff is completely friendly and fun and I love that more than anything. Friendly staff can make okay tasting food into a great food experience and you might not even realize it. The ambiance really seemed to match the whole cocktail dress look, I honestly felt like I was in an episode of the Hills, I don't know if it was the martinis or what, but I really felt like Heidi would walk by with Spencer or something. I loved how the windows looked right out to the Belaggio fountains. The sushi here is really amazing, taste was extremely well balanced, fresh and just left you wanting more and more. I loved the two different kinds of Edamame, the one with the sweet chili sauce on the pods was a hit at the table. I was a little disappointed by how simple the menu was, I like lots of specialty rolls with lots of ingredients in them as opposed to the more simple rolls but the simple rolls were to die for so I am not complaining at all. The entire table seemed to really be enjoying their experience the signature cocktails were well received as well as the food. The birthday dessert brought out was similar take on a chocolate lava cake with a liquor and mint infused foam on top. Perfect to share with a table. I would highly suggest taking a few moments out of your trip and give Yellowtail a try, great place for several occasions and you might see Brody or something!",

The dish itself is a little small and pricey ($23) but worth it, My friend and I also got the edamame, Spicy tuna roll and the poppin spicy crab roll. The edamame was served 2 ways salted and sweet chili sauce very good! Spicy tuna was good but nothing exciting  The poppin spicy crab roll though was awesome!! Crab, Cucumber, Asparagus and oh how about some pop rocks!!! So good and fun with that popping in mouth. Overall it was very good! I had a beer and my friend had a glass of wine and the whole meal was $86..Pricey I know but for the Bellagio and the strip I felt it was ok. The service was also very sharp too.",

The sushi was fresh and tasted great so no complaints there.  Just be ready to spend a few bucks more for the same thing you'd get somewhere off the strip.  It was a really busy night because of some convention next door so the other staff members were a bit brash and rude.

Both times, I've had indigestion afterward. And I eat a lot of sushi, a lot of fish, so it's not just my stomach, it's definitely something here that makes me sick!   Last time I went was for my 21st birthday. It was still a fun experience and I still had a great time, but there are just better places to eat in Vegas. I really do love their butterfish appetizer, it is perfectly cooked, melts in your mouth, and you just talk about how good it tastes for 10 minutes. They also have an Alaskan King Crab tempura app which is pretty good. It was featured on \"The Best Thing I Ever Ate,\" but I think I like the Nobu version better. Anyway, everything else is just all right. Their handrolls aren't really handrolls... They should call them \"tiny stick rolls\" with one smalllll piece of fish in them. They taste good but it just doesn't quite cut it for me.   I wouldn't choose to come here again, not when I can go to Okada or Nobu in LV.",

The good:  the decor is nice and trendy (you can even get a table that faces the Bellagio fountains), service is awesome (which is making me want to give the place a 4), and I probably could have had three servings of the Tuna Pizza - LOVED IT.  The so-so:  the sushi.  For what we were paying, I had higher expectations for the sushi and felt like I could have gotten those rolls anywhere.    If you do plan to dine here, definitely make reservations and I am pretty sure you can make a special request for the tables near the fountain.",

    "text": "2 stars for great ambience and good service - would give a 1/2 star for food if Yelp allowed, but not good enough to round up to 3.  Let me qualify this review by saying we were motivated by a good experience at Noodles and the in room bio about the Korean executive chef who broke down the making of his signature tuna pizza.  Decor / ambience: excellent.  In fact, probably one of the best places on the strip for views of the fountain show and quiet atmosphere for a business dinner or dinner date.  Minimalist decor with candles on each table.  Drink menu presented via a customized iPad app, which was a little over the top, but fine.  Service: fine, exactly what one would expect from a restaurant trying to market itself more on the fine dining spectrum.  Drink glasses always full and empty plates taken away quickly.  Food: herein lies the great and tragic downfall.  We began with the tuna pizza and soft shell crab roll.  The roll was small for our tastes about a 4 inch cut roll, wrapped in nori and soy.  The crab was crisp and fresh though so okay all around.  The pizza however left much to be desired.  The tortilla on which the tuna lay was burnt and overpowered anything that the chefs could have placed on top.  The tuna itself was cut delicately, but tasteless.  The order was followed up with ankimo, Saba roll(Holy Mackerel), hamachi roll (Yellowtail Scallion).  Ankimo was not True pate, but the tube sort, cut into round circles and lacking in any flavor.  The rolls resembled convenient store sushi in appearance - although the rice was soft, there was such an insignificant amount of fish that we really could not taste anything.  I really am not trying to be overly dramatic here - looking at some of the photos I post, you will get a feel for what the plates are like.  The price for the disappointing food was the final nail.  I understand that when going to a place like Yellowtail, you will be overpaying to a certain extent for the ambience and experience.  However to not even receive food I could get from places in LA, I.E., Go's Mart, Katsuya, Sugarfish, or Got Sushi for what Yellowtail charges is ridiculous.  Normally, if I do not like a restaurant, I would not return.  However, I was so dissatisfied with my experience at Yellowtail, that I felt compelled to review.  I do not plan on returning.",

The albacore arrived, it was overly bland and fishy. We're both big albacore fans, and this was this worst we've ever had by far. We sent it back and ordered the bluefin tuna belly. The Bluefin arrived and we both just looked at each other. 6 TINY pieces of sushi with an even smaller amount of fish inside. We waited an additional 20 minutes after the finishing the bluefin for the yellowtail. It was hard to distinguish from the last dish, as this was equal in size. This is not an understatement people, TINY MINUSCULE sushi.  I don't mind paying if the food is good, but in this case, you don't get the quality, or the portions for the price.",

Portions are small which I actually like because I'm not looking to get stuffed ordering a la carte. This is not AYCE. Small portions translate into perfect little bites with a lot of fresh flavor here at Yellowtail.   The King Crab Tempura was outstanding. So delicious. Crispy outside, tender juicy king crab chunks on the inside.  Popping rock spicy crab was amazing! I'm gonna try to get my local sushi chef to add that to their menu.   Toro was priced a little high for even a fancy place but it was fresh and of course, melt-in-your-mouth divinity.  I'll come back to Yellowtail when I'm back in Vegas.",

All 3 salads came at different times and all 3 rolls came at different times. It's rude to start eating when a member of your party is still waiting for their food. You would think a restaurant inside a premium hotel, such as the Bellagio, would understand that.  The 3rd sushi roll came out 10 minutes after the first two. While we were waiting, we asked the waitress about the missing item and she became very defensive. Literally said \"I put in all 3 orders at the same time and you will get it when it is ready.\" It was just a salmon roll. Not like it should have taken extra time to prepare it. We asked our busboy to look into it and he said he would. Then he never came to our table again. We got there right at 5:00 PM and were the 4th table seated; so they should not have been too busy when our order was placed. Food was just OK. I have had much better in San Diego. I don't usually write negative reviews, but since they don't seem to care about customer service, I am posting this as a warning to others. For the price they charge, I expected better. Will not visit again.",

You can also request, in advance to be seated on terrace outside, which a few brave couples did, in 40 degree temps! I love the rock shrimp, the tempura crab, the filet and also the black cod. What I have found in the past as well as this visit is that the sushi here just doesn't cut it for me. They have a good variety and it seems fresh and the choices are pretty much on par with other locations. However, if I were to close my eyes, pick a piece, I would not be able to distinguish the rolls. They all seem to taste the same to me here. Nothing in the sushi selection stands out for me.

The good: The pop rocks (yes, like the candy) sushi roll and the rock shrimp are fantastic. The high steaks roll is good too.   The bad: The second-to-last time we went there, we made a reservation on Open Table. Their airheaded hostesses couldn't even be bothered pressing the button on the screen that said that we had shown up. We spent over $1,000 that night and yet got a nasty note from Open Table saying we were cut off from making reservations, because we had \"No Show\"ed at Yellow Tail. Are you kidding me??   More bad: This last time, we got a call to confirm our reservation, with a warning saying, because they are so full tonight, all dinners are limited to two hours. Basically, we will kick you out. Are you kidding me?   I've had enough of the attitude. There are plenty of great sushi restaurants in Vegas and we'll happily spend our money there.",

    "text": "I've eaten here 3 times and all 3 times I was very happy with the meal.   The first two visits were just normal dinners, a little pricey but I felt like it was worth it for the food/ambiance/experience.   My most recent visit was a little ridiculous because my friend is a pretty big gambler so our group of 5 had an extremely extravagant meal thanks to him. The best part was that we literally tried just about everything on the menu.   Our flight got to Vegas at 9, we were at our villa by 915 and we called and asked for 36 oysters to be ready for us because we were starving. When we arrived they sat us right away and had the oysters ready in minutes! They were so delicious we ordered a second batch.   All the sushi was fresh and delicious (you can see in the pictures I posted), the lobster was really amazing (I actually don't even like lobster to begin with so I was pleasantly surprised when I was going back for seconds) Even the lobster tempura was good, it literally melts in your mouth.   We also had the most AMAZING bottle of wine. It was $1700, so normally we would never but since it was on the casino's dime, why not? I think it was called the Montrachet (I posted a picture of the bottle incase you wanted to try it) but it was the most expensive white wine they had.   We also tried one of everything on the desert menu, I'm not too crazy about sweets but the ice cream was pretty bomb.   It was a fun experience, honestly it is overpriced and pricey but you're in Vegas at the Bellagio so what do you expect? It's got a killer view if you're seated near the balcony so go let loose and have some FUN!",

Like any restaurant there will be things you will like and not like. I have a feeling that there will be few things at Yellow Tail that I would not like. The view of the dancing fountain out front is the \"cherry on top\" of high class ambience.  Don't expect large portions. The food served here is carefully and delicately crafted. Take your time and enjoy every bite and you will be satisfied. If you are looking to hobble out of yellowtail with your belt loosened, then you have the wrong idea. While the prices were high (all Bellagio restaurants are high priced) this was one of the few places that earned their high price. Some have said that this is overrated, my experience did not disappoint and I look forward to going back every time I come to Vegas.",

You are here because you have fat bankroll, a generous sponsor and/or you're very very beautiful.  Unlike some of the more hip upscale places, there weren't any goofy spikey haired mtv types, which is a good thing.  Although I normally evaluate the value of a place, it is difficult to do since I did not see the bill and probably if you are worried about getting your money's worth, you might as well just get a $14 cocktail and enjoy the atmosphere before grabbing a cab and having a giant feast on Spring Mountain for the same price as your cocktail.  We had spicy tuna rolls, flat iron kobe beef, beef tataki, seaweed salad, miso soup, halibut sashima (I think), potstickers, big eye tuna pizza (a surprising dish!), lobster bowl and some weird roll with pop rocks in them.  I made sure that I got full by adding a bowl of rice to my order.  Portions were generally tiny, though aside from the pop rocks, every dish was excellent.  Even the miso soup was done right.  Normally, I am a little bit more aware of the food, but I was a little buzzed and didn't have my inner yelp critic active.  Since they don't publish the menu nor do I have a receipt, I can't remember the exact dish names.  As a practical matter, if you are on a date here, try your best not to get whiplash.  The ladies are out in force here.  If you are here with the guys, then get a table in the waiting area instead of the inner restaurant.  It's the best view in the house.  Finally, a shout out to our generous sponsor.  I doubt that I would have tried this place without 'em.",

The front of the house is staffed by a 20-something, ADD-challenged, Barbie-wanna be who has no clue on how to organize, let alone honor, those people conscientious enough to call ahead for a table.   We (and two other couples who were not with our group) had reservations for 8pm on a Wednesday night. All of us showed up either 5 minutes early or on time, and were asked to wait for a few minutes. No problem, we understand this is usually the case while tables are cleared out.   By 8:20pm, we were all still standing around.   However, during the 25 minute wait for our tables, two Japanese business groups (containing 4-6 people each) showed up without reservations and were rushed through to open seats. When we asked Barbie about this, she just prattled, \"Oh, it'll just be a few more minutes.\"   We left shortly afterward.   I'm not sure what happened to the other 4 schmucks patiently waiting for a table. But as far as I'm concerned, front of house represents the restaurant and if you cannot manage your customers, how do I know whether you can manage the food?  Two thumbs down for this restuarant.",

Had a variety of rolls (all of which tasted very fresh) but smaller portions than your typical sushi places. Rolls vary from your basic spicy tuna, shrimp tempura roll, and unagi rolls.  Yellowtail Tataki was very good (we ordered 3 of them after the first tasting). The pop rock candy roll was ok and something we would pass on the next time. 2 desserts (chocolate in a cup and green tea mousse) were very good (and our waiter picked them out). The dessert actually came with some type of mocha shot and was a nice way to wash down the dessert. 4 bottles of beer and the total was about $340.  Being in Vegas, this is not as authentic as R-23, but the ambiance and service make it a very enjoyable dining experience. We were fortunate enough to have a table next to the window and saw several Bellagio fountain shows and added that much more to the ambiance (music was great too). Our waiter was exceptional and not pushy at all about what to order. He took the time to explain items (I think his name was Roberto). Bonus that he picked out desserts that the wives loved. Would definitely go back to this place.",

My friends and I had three rolls and the yellowtail carpaccio. All of the rolls tasted like $5 supermarket rolls and were super small. The yellowtail carpaccio is what you would expect, sashimi was cut a bit thicker than I normally like. The only plus side to this place was that it was inside bellagio - a great place to gamble (i've had lots of luck at their craps tables there) and that our waitress was super friendly.  My two cents?

    "text": "So I cannot speak for the food, but the mixed drinks are DELICIOUS!  My coworker and I liked it so much that we came here two nights before they closed.  I loved their Lychee cocktail, and my coworker liked their Blood Orange cocktail (sorry, I forget the official name). We each loved our drink enough the first night to re-order it on our second visit. We also tried their cucumber cocktail, which was great as well.  The trade off was the cost - our drinks cost $20 each.   But better one expensive cocktail than 2 or 3 horrible cheap ones!  The service here was great too.  The waitress we had on the first night was great - kind and quick to help us. The bartender on the second visit was also friendly and nice to chat with.  If you are walking through the Bellagio and looking for a drink, stop here.  You won't regret it!",

    "text": "Yellowtail is consistently a wonderful dining experience!  My husband and I dined here with friends and were impressed again with the quality of food and drinks from this restaurant.  The service was a bit off, with it taking almost 20 minutes to receive our cocktails once we sat down.  I gave it four stars because of this oversight, seeing as how it was after 10:30 pm and the restaurant was not busy.  Our server did an excellent job when it came time for sushi recommendations, and even though it's not listed on the menu - always get the sushi pizza - it's delicious!!!  We recommend also trying the sashimi platter (so fresh!!!), the pop rocks roll, and the spicy tuna.  All are excellent and are a good way to judge the difference between this restaurant and the run-of-the-mill sushi experience.  The view also cannot be beat!!  The Fountains at Bellagio show is not to be missed - it's awesome!!!  :)  Cheers!",

I loved the kick in the spicy Miso soup and the crab was a great compliment to it- the rock shrimp were yummy also. Ask for some sriracha to use as dipping sauce. Service was impeccable...we had a rotation of servers taking care of us and checking on us both visits. Ambiance is dark lit, intimate, swanky on the inside. Thanks yellowtail",

We ordered the edamame, gyoza, foie gras, and sushi rolls I don't remember which as it was not worth the price we paid.  I was so excited when I saw the foie gras because I absolutely love it and being from California, I do not get it often unless I travel out of the state. I was extremely disappointed as they covered the delicious natural taste of it with too much of the other stuff to make it look pretty. Honestly you can't go wrong with edamame and gyoza as they are staples in sushi restaurants so I was glad we had that to fill up on.  I would like to mention the lack of friendly service as well. The worst service yet the most expensive place we ate at this weekend. Not okay at all. I did get a glance of the dancing Bellagio fountains which was a nice touch though.",

We had dinner at Yellowtail prior to the O show at the Bellagio (magnificent show, highly recommend). We decided to order a few small plates instead of entrees and settled on the tuna pizza with truffle oil (my favorite dish), the new salmon (second favorite dish, quite delicate and fresh), crab handrolls (too saucy), and a crispy rice dish (also too saucy). Overall the food was quite good, though the freshness of the fish seemed to be lost in the sauce. We also ordered a bottle of unfiltered sake which was fine, though definitely overpriced for the quality. If you want a nice meal in Vegas with good ambience and service and dont have a budget, Yellowtail is worth a try. Otherwise, there's better Japanese food off strip.",

Accurate statement t-swizzle!   I've been here at least 4 times; the most recent visit on 6/28. Attractive hostesses/waitresses, waitstaff team service is top notch, super friendly, and attentive. Every single time. Nice, classy atmosphere and clientele. Everything you should expect in a high-end restaurant business. Phenomenal food. All reasons why I keep coming back for more!   TIP: Ask for a patio view table outside so you can watch the fountain show. One should be available if it's not too busy. It will enhance your dining experience even more!  From what I remember, I've tried:  -Big Eye Tuna Pizza -Kobe Beef Tataki -Popping Spicy Crab Roll (pop rocks and sushi..unique combo..i didn't come here for rolls, but this is a must try..i love it!)  -Braised Kobe Beef Short Ribs -Kobe Beef Flat Iron -16oz Vintage Ribeye -Potato Puree  Every choice was amazing. I can't put into words how awesome each food item was. I could randomly choose any item on the menu and be confident that it would be of superb quality. Thanks Yellowtail @Bellagio, I am glad to be a return customer and will definitely be back!",

Our party was 3 people and our bill was $710.55 without tip included yet:(  I got the ribeye and the Wagyu beef. I would pass on the ribeye. It was too tough and chewy. It also came out almost raw so I had to send it back to get it cooked some more.  The best thing here is the Kobe wagyu beef! It's served on a hot stone so u can cook it more if you'd like! Medium rare is good for Wagyu because it's so soft and tender.   My fam got the sushi rolls. I don't eat sushi myself, but they said it was okay. My mom liked the uni roll",

Uni is one of my favorite things to eat. The sushi were pretty good. Not the best ever but pretty decent. If I was more hungry I would have definitely ordered the uni pasta!  I wasn't that hungry but there is always room for dessert right? Haha. I had the yuzu citrus. It was not only really good it was also so pretty! I could stare at it forever with the flowers and all. See attached pic. The yuzu flavor came through really nicely and the strawberry gelato was good without being overpowering.  So next time, same dessert and some uni pasta!",

The place probably wouldn't hire Chef Akira Back, his rolls are portioned too small and the quality is not much better than what you'd find at a Grocery store or gas station.",

The flavors of some of the dishes just did not match my palette. I am a huge sushi fan, but I didn't even want to try their nigiris. The sushi rice was way too sweet, and the fish they served was okay. I would not really want to go back to eat here again, especially at the price that they put everything at.",

We first started off with the tuna pizza (it's not what you think), it's thin sliced sashimi on a chip with some good truffle oil inside. After that we got a few rolls is sushi. The first one was a yellowtail sushi which was rather fresh and straightforward. We then got a roll that had tuna on the top and a spicy aioli that was really good. (And I don't like mayo) we then got the ribs and mashed potatoes. I didn't think either of those belonged as a sushi restaurant but they were both really good. Perhaps some of the best mashed potatoes I have had. The sauce is what did it for me for the ribs. (They didn't have a one in them and were cooked perfectly.)   Lastly, we got the recommended deserts on the menu. One was the apple desert and the other Was the chocolate desert (I think it was first on the menu.) I was not impressed with either of them and would recommend that you try another place for desert.   The table was awesome, it was outside on the patio and we got to see the fountain show many times. Beware that if the wind blows wrong you will get wet.",

    "text": "Located just steps from the Bellagio North Entrance you'll find Chef Akira Back's Yellowtail, his first of two restaurants in the city. It's an upscale, trendy setting so you can have a fine dining experience without the stuffiness. It overlooks the Bellagio Fountains but honestly it doesn't enhance your experience. The prices are higher than most will expect to pay for Japanese food but you get what you pay for in terms of quality. I will preface this next part by saying I don't eat seafood. Still, I believe I can do justice to this review.   The restaurant has a lounge area at the entrance overlooking the casino. You'll pass the bar area and small high top tables on the way to their larger, open main dining room. The lights are dim and the noise level is loud enough to feel busy but not so overbearing that it drowns out conversations. I've been here many times (it is one of my favorite restaurants, after all) and the service is great for the most part but it isn't consistently stellar. Still, most times they are friendly and attentive. The food is spectacular in taste and presentation. Have the Big Eye Tuna Pizza start you off. Other great appetizers include the Alaska King Crab Tempura and the Rock Shrimp. Their rolls are good (popular ones include the Happa, Mile High, and Protein Roll) but my vote goes to the Poppin' Spicy Crab Roll because it's pretty unique. When moving to entrees a must is their Jidori Chicken. Don't question me, just do it. You'll be glad you did. For variety get the Filet Mignon Toban - or simply refer to it as the \"Sizzling Plate.\" Yes, I know you can get more for less by ordering the Black Angus Ribeye but this tastes better.   Desserts aren't elaborate but they still taste good. My go-to is their Chocolate in a Cup. It's exactly as it sounds.   Tip: If you value convenience over money valet at the North Entrance off Flamingo - $21 vs $9 parking fee + free hike to restaurant",

The concierge pointed me in the direction of Yellowtail.   Pretty busy for a Monday night to be honest. Sat at the bar where I had three fairly attentive bartenders. They didn't steer me in the wrong direction. Had the Tuna Pizza which I was told was a MUST. It was way better than I expected. Very flavorful and the truffle oil was a nice compliment. This paired nicely with my vodka rocks and I was off to the races.  Next up the protein roll and mile high roll. Both were fresh, presentation rocked, and really good! All this cost about $90.  So it's not the cheapest sushi place but def not the most expensive. Very impressed, will be back!",

You really can't go wrong, but my favorite items include the Big Eye Tuna Pizza, the Broiled Atlantic Black Cod, the Jidori Chicken, and the Mile High specialty roll. The staff and management are very friendly and knowledgeable. The service you receive only enhances the experience, and makes you want to return. Yellowtail also has the best view of the Bellagio fountain show. While it's occasionally difficult to get seats on the balcony, the staff will let you go outside during the water shows, which I must say is far better and more private than viewing it from the strip. But whether you sit inside or outside the environment is sublime. From the food, the service, and even the music, everything is perfect. If you're coming to Las Vegas you need to experience what Yellowtail has to offer!!",

Our service was poor (w/ the exception of one waiter) due to attitude, empty glasses, failing to check on us etc., and the food was unnecessarily outrageously priced! Am I right!! Why does it need to be so expensive for such small quantities? The rolls have only a spec of sushi on top, and the taku was paper thin. What am I missing here? Other than the rest of my order. However, worth mentioning is the halibut as that was fantastic! All the other pieces we tried were extremely small and very much over priced. You're certainly paying the Bellagio tax when trying any restaurant and especially the Yellowtail.",

Our waiter (Guy) was outstanding. We were those annoying people that had dinner reservations at 7:30 and a show at 9:00. We let Guy know this at the beginning and I'm pretty sure I rolled my eyes at myself but Guy said he'd do all he could. He made a few food recommendations (all of which we chose) and he couldn't have been more spot on. So 4 plates, 3 drinks, a photo shoot in front of the fountains (also with the help of Guy) and the bill we were out of there by 8:30 and had plenty of time to make it to the show.

I got there and the hostesses were super accommodating and gave me a seat on the patio with a breathtaking view of the Bellagio fountains.  SERVICE: My server who's name was Mickel \"Like nickel and pickle\" was an absolute gem. He made pleasant conversation with me and we chatted about what was great about traveling solo. It was a really welcoming experience to someone dining alone.  FOOD: I got the tempura crab, some wine, and some strawberry gelato to end. Hands down one of the most delicious meals I've ever had. It was pricey but the view and the staff and the food made it worthwhile.  AMBIANCE: The fountains went off and music played over the speakers every 30min or so, and there was no question that myself and the other patio-diners had the best seats in the house. I hope to be able to go back someday.",

The waiter was fun, made great suggestions for drinks and dinner - loved him! He even brought us all a round of shots on him. I ordered the Essence Martini - Effen Cucumber Vodka and Cucumber Puree.....so delicious.   But the hostess was rather rude and told us to be sure we were done eating/drinking in two hours and we were only allowed to have our table for a two hour time frame. I understand if this is the restaurants policy, but I feel as thought there are nicer ways of saying it. Plus we ate an early dinner and were one of very few tables in the restaurant at the time so I didn't understand the need to make us feel so uncomfortable from the get go. Besides that everything was stellar!",

    "text": "I was a little torn between giving this place two or three stars. Would have given the two mainly because Vegas prices are outlandish and so is the price of EVERYTHING on this menu. I mean, REALLY, $19 for one basic a$$ roll is NOT cool. But it's Vegas.   The fish itself was fresh and wonderful. I had the angry salmon roll which has incredibly basic ingredients. Can I just point out that I pay $5.95 for a salmon and avocado roll here in St. Louis? No complaints on the taste and ingredients of this roll.   Also had the big eye tuna pizza. What a different take on tuna and pizza! It was really light, airy, crispy, and yummy. Only complaint again? Price. Ridiculous. I wish I could poop money because then I could give a crap about the pricing, haha, get it?  The ambiance of the place was perfect for our occasion, we were heading to Hyde Nightclub afterwards. The decor of the place is beautiful.   The service was crap. We were a table of 8, yeah, larger tables are harder to serve, but there were maybe 3 to 4 other tables there. And at least 3 servers. So the incredibly lethargic speed of our server was uncalled for.    Not going to lie, I will not eat sushi in Vegas again...unless someone else is fronting that bill. HAHAHA. I am so cheap...",

    "text": "Trendy, trendy, oh so trendy. Yellowtail greets you with scantily clad exotic waitresses (this is Vegas after all) and you eat your small portioned Japanese gastro pub dishes while endless techno club music pounds in the background. While eating Japanese food in this manner isn't really my style, and holding a conversation at a table larger than two was rather difficult, Yellowtail did leave my tastebuds popping with pleasure from a few select dishes. One minus was that the food took a while to come out. It's a truly one of a kind place from which to view the Bellagio fountain show. They have a balcony you can watch from, and you're on the side of the Bellagio right up in the action - I could feel a slight mist from the shooting water!  My favorites:  Seaweed salad: The seaweed was fresh, with two different kinds, and the sauce was tangy and refreshing.  Salmon and sweet shrimp sashimi: The salmon was a more expensive cut than you usually get, a darker orange salmon with more punchy flavor. I've had sweeter ones, but these shrimp were up there and fresh. The heads were fried to perfection, and you could eat 100% of the fried shell. Crunchy!  Big eye tuna pizza: Now here's something innovative and unique. You're getting fusion cuisine at its best, with thinly slice tuna sashimi laid on top of thin cracker style crust, with truffle flavors and small garnish tying it all together in a savory finish. This was a wonderful surprise and really got my umami on. I loved the pairing of the truffle with tuna sashimi and the crunchy texture of the crust to offset the soft raw fish.  Protein roll: We tried a few rolls and this was by far the head of the class. It's called the protein roll because there's no rice! A well seasoned seafood and fish egg mix is wrapped inside layers of fresh sashimi. The roll disappeared in seconds, and one of our party didn't even get to try a piece! Oops.  Other things we tried:  The Kobe beef tataki was pretty good; the texture of the raw beef was phenomenal, as it was fresh Kobe, and you could see the delicate marbling in the meat. However it seemed a waste to drown it in a soy sauce based sauce, with raw garlic slices as garnish, since they are both very strong flavors and high quality beef should be worshipped instead of overpowered.  The Alaskan king crab tempura was apparently featured on Best Things I Ever Ate with Chopsticks. I thought that it was good, and the sauce was savory and tangy, but it didn't seem like anything special enough for a TV show. How could something fried like that be bad? Seems a shame for fresh crab.  We tried some other rolls, but none else were memorable. The vegetable tempura was nothing special, the rock shrimp tempura had a mayo-y spicy sauce and was good, but like something from a seriously upscale Buffalo Wild Wings.",

We started off with the Big eye tuna pizza and rock shrimp.  The orders come out one by one, so you don't have the opportunity to stuff yourself in one go.  We also ordered the Yellowtail Serrano, angry salmon roll, and toro scallion roll.  The highlights of the meal were definitely the big eye tuna pizza and the rock shrimp.  Everything had impeccable flavor and taste.  The fish tasted so fresh.  The big eye tuna pizza had the perfect crisp to it.  The rock shrimp had great flavor and sauce, but was not drenched in sauce at the same time.  The angry salmon was good, but the sushi rolls in general were not my favorite items.  Service was fast and attentive, and our servers were very knowledgeable about the menu.  The ambiance was dark, seductive and sultry with some tables having the fountain view.  I would definitely return here during my next stay in Vegas for an upscale meal.",

    "text": "I ate here on a Monday evening with my teenage son. It was very easy to get to, just inside the valet area, and adjacent to the casino. Valet is no charge, tips only.   My first impression of the restaurant was that it was upscale but very loud. My son wore a t-shirt and shorts and felt a little underdressed. He was the youngest person in the restaurant by far and he is 14 years old. Attire is definitely business casual to more formal.   Our server was incredibly attentive and kind, and seemed genuinely interested in helping us have a great dining experience.   The good was delicious . Being my son'a first experience with sushi, I ordered a cucumber salad, vegetable tempera, Cali roll and Shrimp tempera roll. We shared them all. The food was delicious! For the price I felt the portions could have been a bit bigger. Had the rolls been a bit lower priced, I would have ordered each of us our own rather than sharing. Our meal came to $75 with tip.   One great surprise to Yellowtail is location. On a warm night, you can be seated on their balcony and enjoy the Bellagio fountains which are right there! After our dinner we enjoyed watching the fountains dance for about 30 minutes (2 shows) before leaving.",

My spicy miso soup was incredible, made with fresh crab and tofu in a surprisingly spicy miso broth. For my main course I went with the flat iron kobe steak. It was as tender as any steak could get, back lacked flavor. My friends ordered an array of sashimi, all of which was excellent. However, you could get the same quality sashimi in San Francisco at better prices. The prices of the sake were outrages so we all settled for their signature cocktails, all of which were delightful, especially my \"sunrise\" drink- made with grey goose vodka and blood orange juice. 4 cocktails= $80. Total cost of our dinner= $470 :O  Was it worth it? Not really! But was it very good? Yes!",

We love sushi - there are a lot of GREAT sushi places in SD so we had high expectations of this place.  First the choice of sushi rolls were super basic and boring.  Nothing creative or even remotely enticing.  We started with the seafood ceviche.  The portion size was a joke.  Seriously, I'm guessing that we were served about a half cup of ceviche with 5 or 6 wonton chips.  Not off to a great start.  Then we ordered 3 different rolls to share - all 3 were bland, boring and super small.  After a very disappointing meal, we then get the check and see that the Rainbow roll that we ordered was $30.  Are you kidding me??  Take my advice and find another sushi restaurant.",

They sat us at a round table that we all appreciated. However you weren't able to focus on the atmosphere because the hip-hop dance music was playing so loud it was difficult to even talk to the person next to you. (now don't get me wrong - we went clubbing after dinner and hip-hop dance is what were after that nite but with a 5 star level of service the music was really contradictory to the atmosphere). It was also very dark - almost so much so that it was hard to read the menu.  We were greated promptly and presented with the wine and saki menu. They have no warm saki so I chose a cold saki that they were out of. The sommelier was sent over to make other recommendations but it was just as though she was reading from the saki menu, not really making any suggestions or asking me what I had in mind. Therefore on my third try for a drink I opted for a cocktail, but other members of my party got sparkling saki that they enjoyed.  Our server was prompt and seemed very knowledgeable. He made great recommendations, many of which we tried. This is not your typical sushi roll restaurant! They had the best albacore tuna and yellowtail sashimi that I have ever eaten (and I have eaten sashimi all over the world). Other members of my party enjoyed the spicy tuna snapping roll - I recommend you try it! The cucumber salad was heavenly with a sesame dresssing. The espresso was wonderful at the end of meal with dessert!  Overall this experience was slightly pleasureable and never forgettable, the food was excellent in quality and flavor, average in presentation. We probably won't eat there again and most likely won't recommend it. Maybe lunch there would have been a better choice.",

I can't say enough about the Big Eye Tuna Pizza.  Covered in truffle oil and sooooo good. I want to go back just to eat this.  Their sweet chili edamame and the crab and shrimp rolls wrapped in soy paper were also really really good.  The Jidori Chicken and Rock Shrimp were so-so. Nothing amazing.  We thought that the eggplant skewers were beef, really tasty and hearty.  All in all a fun meal, great atmosphere. I'm definitely going back here for the tuna pizza!",

Who uses a crab stick in sushi at such a level of restaurant? The batter in rock prawns was hard, chewy. And what shushi restaurant can't serve a decent-crisp and steamed to death edamame?!!! We should've gamble the money instead of spending it in that hole..never again. Try Nobu at Ceasers palace or Kai sushi at Planet Hollywood instead.",

    "text": "My visit in June 2010 was my second since first trying this restaurant in 2009. And, I have to say that both experiences were terrible. In both visits, a group of 3 to 5 of us had reservations. However, we had to wait an hour to be seated. During my most recent visit, the manager even had the nerve to say, \"We're waiting for you. Are you ready?\", after we sat at the bar for an hour (I checked in with the hostess several times). I was close to punching him where he stood.  The food was poor quality for the price. We ordered a couple of rolls and were told that they take more time than other menu items. Ummmm. . . . that doesn't make sense. You don't have to cook anything for the rolls we ordered. However, we theorized that they had to catch the fish first . . . . in Japan.  It's sad that this place is in the Bellagio, a high-quality resort. Of course, I will never ever visit this restaurant again in my entire life.  The End.",

    "text": "So I went to Vegas this past weekend for my friend's birthday and we decided on Yellowtail for dinner. We wanted an elegant setting and a good range of choices. I was excited for dinner even before we got to Vegas! I knew it would be fairly expensive and portion size wouldn't be all that filling. But damn!   My friend ordered the Scottish Salmon and asked the waiter approximately how large the fillets would be and he said \"two pieces of salmon equal to about 7oz.\" and then he gave us a visual of the two fillets and motioned them being placed on the plate \"boom, boom\" he said for each piece of salmon. When her dish came out, we were looking at it in dismay. This did not look like a \"BOOM BOOM\" but more like a \"bing bing!\" Boy, was that microscopic. I tasted some. The texture of the salmon wasn't bad, not too dry. However, my taste buds don't fancy sour marinade so I didn't really enjoy it. But hey, \"one man's trash is another man's treasure.\"  My other friend ordered the Braised Kobe Beef Short Ribs. The texture and taste was quite succulent. The beef was tender and juicy. The only thing wrong was that it was the size of one of the salmon fillets.   Another friend ordered the Big Eye Tuna Pizza and the Popping Spicy Crab Roll. The pizza was alright. Thinly sliced tuna on top of a thin cracker-like crust. That, too, had a sour taste. The Popping Spicy Crab Roll was ... fun. I wanted to try some so my friend ordered it. What was fun about it was that it consisted of Pop Rocks! When they first brought it out, you could hear the Pop Rocks crackling in the roll. I have a major sweet tooth, so I enjoyed the contrast of the pop rocks and the crab.   I ordered the Angry Salmon Roll. It wasn't horrible, except that the roll had a diameter of maybe a quarter. Mediocre to me. It filled me up quite nicely and kept my bill under $20. Overall I thought Yellowtail was average for the classy prices they were charging for each dish.   P.S.  Did I mention that the portion sizes are very small?",

    "text": "We ate at this place about 4 years ago and absolutely loved everything about it, the food, the service, the ambiance, and, of course, the view of the fountains. This time around, we still loved three out of four of those aspects.  The food was delicious. The rolls are on the smaller side but the fish is very fresh and the seasoning is perfect. We had a split opinion about the popping crab roll. I personally did not enjoy the \"popping\" part as it felt like my rolls had sand in it, but the rest of the group loved it. The ambiance is still amazing. From the outside, the restaurant looks like a typical strip mall sushi place. Inside, however, it is gorgeous and very romantic. Service, unfortunately, was a bit underwhelming. We ordered our food and I, specifically, asked that we get the dynamite shared plate as an appetizer. However, our server decided that he'd bring the dynamite last, as he didn't want us to fill up on the mayo. Had he brought it up with us, we may have agreed. But he made that decision himself. Somehow, the vibe of the service felt as if they are doing is a favor by letting us done there. Other than that it was a delicious dinner. Next time, I'd probably try another place.",

    "text": "Decor is nice, staff is friendly, and service was excellent.  Food, and I get it, you're a 'high-end' restaurant, was forgettable. The proportions were small and butchered. High end or not there is an art to cutting sushi.  Our meal:  'Sushi' Hamachi - VERY good, best part of my meal, but again, each slice was about the size of my pinky Tuna - quality of the meat was good but the meat was butchered to the likes of which I've never seen and again, the slices were about the size of my pinky.  'Entree' Sea Bass - for the price we were a bit surprised to only receive a piece about the size of one and one half golf balls, we were told it was large enough to share; it was good.  'Rolls' This is more of where the major disappointment came in. The rolls were very small and basically fell apart upon touching. I'm no sushi expert but I believe the rice is the portion of a roll that the chef takes the most pride in  Hamachi roll - fish was SUPER fresh but it again was butchered and appeared to be more of the left overs than a fresh cut of meat meant to be placed in a roll.  Shrimp tempura roll - there was very little 'tempura' to the roll and it felt as though the shrimp was split in half to fill an already tiny roll.  Gyoza - Not that it was bad but I mean its Gyoza and I've had better at Ramen shops.   My wife had a lychee martini that was pretty damn good and they have plenty of beers/wines/sake on hand. Not listed is a warm sake which is decent and cheap at $18.   I think the lesson to be learned here is that just because you charge more than market prices for your food that doesnt mean you're a high-end restaurant. There is a sushi joint 2 blocks from my house across the street from an auto parts store that could teach the chefs here a few lessons on preparation, the proportions are larger, the fish is of equal quality, and the prices are a little less. I'm not trying to harp on price here, I go to Vegas knowing Im paying more for everything.  We were never offered tea, no edamame which at least to me seems to be a default appetizer when you visit a sushi restaurant. No Ahi Poke on the menu but I didnt ask and they do have a Ahi tartare if I remember correctly, no chicken karage, and I dont even recall a side salad with the awesome miso dressing 99.9% of sushi restaurants offer.  Again, the food was NOT bad, the services was good, the ambiance was elegant but it felt more like a steakhouse trying to be a sushi spot. I would like to visit again and hopefully I'll be able to give another star.   I would recommend checking it out for yourself if you're really craving sushi and have a couple hundred to blow. It's an experience and maybe they just had an off night.   My personal opinion is that I'll try a couple more Sushi joints before returning here.",

    "text": "VERY DISAPPOINTING FOOD QUALITY, PRICE AND SERVICE.  The Yellowtail restaurant Almost seems like it does not belong in the Bellagio. I expected better.   My husband and I go to Bellagio twice-yearly just to splurge and stay for the spa.  The multitude of restaurants and Buffet is excellent and the price never bothered me, until now.  The \"dynamite\" Seafood dish was a mush of mostly canned corn, fried old shrimp and chewy leftover scallop pieces  amalgamated in an overly sweetened mayonnaise sauce.  EXCEEDINGLY OVERPRICED at $32.  For four small lumps of Kobe ribs, you pay $42.  Each refill of Coca cola was $5.  Very limited menu overall. Sushi is average and again, OVERPRICED at about $7-8 a PIECE. The Japanese yellowtail sashimi was tasteless and rubbery, for example.   But lets talk about the worst service for an over-hyped restaurant where the decor cost needed to be made up in what you pay for bad food.  Each dish came out within 20min of each other.  Each person at my table waited and watched as the other person finished his meal.   Waiter said he would bring our meals but never did.  My second drink came at the end of my meal.  After paying $250 for a meal that deserved $50 I MUST SAY THAT THIS HAS BEEN THE MOST DISAPPOINTING MEAL, EVER! If any person from management of Yellowtail sushi would like to discuss this further, I am happy to do so.",

We started with some sparkling sake with blueberry puree.  It was actually really good, seemed like an odd combination at first, but clearly they know more about these things than I do because it worked quite well.  The sweet chili sauce on the edamame was all very good.  The sushi wasn't anything special.  It was good, but nothing I'd go out of my way for.    The dining room was very pretty and the ambiance was nice.  It's Vegas, if they can't make you comfortable in a restaurant then you're in the wrong place.  Considering the prices you're paying I expect a comfortable dining experience.  Overlooking the Bellagio fount is a nice addition to a dinner.  I have a hard time calling anything in Vegas \"romantic\" but I suppose this should be deemed a romantic restaurant.    Seems like the place was crawling with staff, every direction you look there's a server or hostess descending on you.  It was a little on the annoying side, but the food and drinks made up for it.   Overall, it was pretty good.  If you're looking for good sushi on the strip Yellowtail is a good place to start your search.",

To start it's got a nice ambiance but their sushi is extremely overpriced and isn't anything special.  But whatever no problem paying quadruple price for their rolls. Actually enjoyed their little miso and clear soup and their jalapeno yellowtail. Didn't see any rice on their menu and my wife being Chinese we love our fried rice so we asked if they had any in house. The wait staff replied yes of course though we don't have it on the menu we can definitely accommodate that for you. Asked if we would like chicken, beef, or shrimp on it. So my wife replied \"yeah chicken would be great\". Rice was okay. Dish came in the regular bowl size rice about a cup and a half, with a few diced pieces of chicken and some green onions. It was average. Flash forward to the bill $45 for a small cup of rice. The item was entered in as  hot special. Thought I just ordered a cup of rice. After the waitress gave us excuses the manager came over and gave us even more ridiculous excuses saying \"unfortunate we aren't allowed to disclose prices to our guest\". This is the Bellagio and and we have high standards. Total clown. Also gave me the excuse we use the finest Jidori chicken. I could have bought the entire jidori chciken on their menu for this price or a prime steak. I only got 4 small cubes of the Chicken about an ounce and a half. If you have high standard then when I asked for a small side of rice you should have had some class and up sold by saying, \"would you like to complement the premium fried rice with our finest jidori chicken or a prime beef or our mercury free sustainable shrimp that we don't have\". Then I would have an idea I'm purchasing a $45 cup of rice. I've worked in hospitality for 15 years at some of the nicest restaurants in los angles I would never try this kind of bullshit with a guest.",

I was able to place my reservation online using the mLife portal.  Let me start by saying Yellowtail is expensive. If you're looking to have dinner/drinks for a party of four, prepare to spend about $75-100 per person.  That being said, Yellowtail is also very delicious! We started by ordering some small plates (Gyoza, Edamame, Ceviche) which were shared. The Gyoza came out hot and crispy on the bottom, they were very full of flavor. The Ceviche is served with five fried wonton \"chips\" to use, and was very flavorful and had a strong citrus backing. The Edamame comes out served two ways, one small bowl with traditional steam and another tossed with a Chili Sauce. Trust me when I say this, get the Chili Sauce! It's FANTASTIC!  For our meal we ordered an assortment of sushi rolls, sashimi and nigiri. We had several special requests for preparation of these rolls and they were followed well. As other reviewers have said, the Crispy Kalbi is very special. Korean short ribs and slaw as a role? Sounds crazy, but it works!  So is Yellowtail overpriced? Yes, obviously ($14 for a 12oz can of Japanese Beer, for example). But show me one restaurant located in a casino that isn't. If you're willing to overlook the price, it's actually a really fantastic Sushi restaurant and fun dining experience.",

    "text": "Overview: Yellowtail is a Japanese restaurant for people who are afraid of Japanese food.  When my wife and I went to Vegas for our anniversary, Yellowtail at Bellagio very nearly ruined it. For background: My mother is Japanese, and I've been fortunate enough to visit many times. I don't need my Japanese food to be authentic, but it does have to taste good.  Yellowtail's food is neither authentic nor good. The glazed salmon I ordered was soaked in a sugar sauce, sweet to the point of being inedible. (My theory: To cover up the fact they serve cheap salmon.)  To their credit, when my waiter came over, he immediately asked me what was wrong. When I told him, he quickly replaced the dish with something edible but completely forgettable. (The good service is the only thing that brings Yellowtail up to two stars.) My wife had a similar experience. The food is more \"Japanese-y\" than Japanese.  Unfortunately for me, I had a severe stomach ache for the rest of the night - a distraction to say the least when I was trying to enjoy Cirque du Solei. The Bellagio hotel staff were completely unhelpful to the point of belligerence, but that's a story for another time.  My wife and I are already planning our next trip to Vegas. We would have considered staying at the Bellagio. But after our experience with Yellowtail (and Bellagio), we're going back to the Wynn. They certainly know how to treat customers well there.",

We also had their peppers as an app. The ambiance is great for a few drinks and apps before a night out with great upbeat music. And they are a located right in between Hyde and The Bank! Ordered their lychee martini, however it did not include the fruit as it is made with the puree. Either way, love this place!!",

    "text": "The worst most expensive meal I have ever not enjoyed in Las Vegas.  The miserable tone for the meal was set when the host announced to our party of 7 that we had a 2 hour time limit on the table.  OK, I get it, they do not want diners to linger.  We were on the clock. However, it took 25 minutes to get a drink, then 40 minutes before the first appetizers arrived.  In the meantime, the waiter spilled a gin and tonic down my buddy's back (which was actually quite entertaining for the rest of us).  Then for some strange reason, the main courses arrived in staggered fashion, with a 20 minute gap between the first and last entrees.  It literally felt like we were being punished. I have had two great meals in this restaurant in the last year.  This was the worst.  Even the quality of the food was below standards.   They need a good swift kick in the ass.  Avoid this hell hole.",

Our bill was well over $300 We are fit people and do not over eat at all, but we had to seriously go to another place to get a snack to feel like we ate after Yellowtail. We got the braised short ribs because the server said it was a great portion. It was literally 5 average bites and it was gone. It was good but gimmie a break. We got a sushi pizza thinkin it was like back at home and this would fill us up.....wrong.... it was a big round flat cracker with tuna on top. Again it was fresh but it was not worth the money. We ordered 4 times and were not full. Save your money and go to the other amazing places they have in the Bellagio for a good price an you will be full.",

As fans of fine dining, I was a tad worried about the three-star rating before we decided to make a reservation, but we were not disappointed!    You cannot go to Yellowtail without having the Big Eye Tuna Pizza.  While this is something that I wouldn't ordinarily order, after reading the reviews on yelp, we ordered one as a starter.  It was honestly one of the best things I have ever put in my mouth! ;) We followed it up with the tempura lobster (from The Best Thing I Ever Ate) and a couple sushi rolls including one with pop rocks.  In all, our dining experience was not just tasty, but elicited all of our senses and was truly a dining experience.    The only down point was the service.  It was actually pretty horrible but the food made up for it enough for me not to deduct a star.  We figured the bad service was due to the A-list singer and D-list reality star sitting at the tables next to us, but we still would have liked a little more attention for our $300+ dinner!  All-in-all, this is an underrated place in Vegas that cannot be missed!",

They wanted to eat at Outback Steakhouse since they spent the day buying designer belts, but I was NOT down for that. I told them that this place had a steak too... a grown up steak.  Anyways, I had the spicy tuna roll, the eel roll, and the surf clam sushi. Spicy tuna: just the right amount of spice. Had a great kick to it and the fish tasted super fresh. Also had some scallions thrown in there which heightened the flavor a bit Eel roll: Pretty good. IMO it's pretty easy to mess up an eel roll by dousing it with sauce, but this was perfect. Surf clam sushi: Best surf clam I've had in awhile. Surf clam can be awfully tough and hard to chew, but this was great. Surf clam was tender and just the perfect consistency.   Our server was amazing. He was very accommodating to my friends and I. Regularly checked up on us, topped up our drinks, and made sure that our table was spotless.   My friends didn't want to admit that they had the best steak of their lives that night, despite the small portions, but I'll take their facial expressions at face value. It's really hard to find a non-gimmicky place in Vegas, but this was it for me. Loveee Yellowtail and I'll def be back soon.",

I've had twice as much sushi that was twice as good for half the price. If you're being comped knock yourself out, but if you're actually paying for the food go ANYWHERE else. Three and a half star food, one star service, and I have no idea why this place has three dollar signs. A proper dinner for two would run you at least $250 excluding tip.",

    "text": "I don't consider myself a cheap person.  But I value quality and quantity equally.  So when I come to a restaurant that looks fancy, acts fancy and provides fancy food, I'm mentally prepared to dish out some good money.  But when that fancy food equates to the same type of food I can get elsewhere for half the price and double the portions, I get mad.  This is Yellowtail.  Yes, the tuna pizza was delicious and probably the highlight of the entire meal as far as taste and value goes.  The Kumamoto Oysters were delicious but they were overpriced.  Besides those dishes and ordering a soft shell crab roll, an angry salmon roll and a spicy tuna roll, four slender girls (we're not fatties that eat a ridiculous amount of food) left hungry.  We decided not to order any more food because at that point, we realized that no matter how much more food we ate, we wouldn't be full unless we ended up shelling $100 each.  So at a tab of  about $125 (all we had was water to drink), we decided to cut our losses and headed straight to the Bellagio snack bar.  Yes, the snack bar.  We were all still so hungry that we actually didn't feel satisfied with what we ate.  The service was good but I felt that the server was a bit pushy with ordering more things or trying to push us to order something from the bar.  But in hindsight, she probably knew that the things we ordered wouldn't fill us up.    Definitely not worth going to, there are so many better places that you can get this kind of food without dipping into your gambling bankroll.  Save your money to use it on something worth wasting your money on...like Megabucks.  At least then, you'd have a chance to get some of your money back, instead of it just turning into crap.",

That was not going to cut it. So we looked through the restaurants in Bellagio and passed Yellowtail. It was a bit more than I wanted to spend but we were hungry and tired.   We were sat immediately. I must say it is a beautiful restaurant. The rear of the restaurant looks out over the Bellagio fountains so we could watch the fountain show from our seats.   Now to the food...the kid got edamame and gyoza. The edamame came 2 ways: with sea salt and with thai sweet chili sauce. Edamame with sauce was very tasty. Then wife and I ordered 2 sushi rolls. The one that stands out had pop rocks in it. It was surprisingly good. For entree I ordered Kobe Flat Iron Steak and my wife had Scottish Salmon. Both delicious but portions were on the small side, typical of over-priced Las Vegas restaurant. The food is so expensive because they don't turn the tables so you have to make all you can get off of each table.  Unlike some of the other reviews we had good service.  We enjoyed the food but $170 including tip is a little steep for edamame, gyoza, 2 rolls, salmon, steak, and green tea cake. If we had more time we probably would have gone to Michael Mina or made our way to another celebrity chef restaurant. I am not going to fault them on stars due to price because that is what good Vegas restaurants cost. I would only complain if the food did not equal the price.",

We ordered most of the popular dishes: Big Eye Tuna Pizza (Crispy), Tempura King Crab (Crabby Crab Crab), Kobe Beef Tataki (raw and weird at first), Crispy Soft Shell crab and one specialty sushi (don't remember the name because it wasn't memorable). I was very pleased with the suggested dishes by the waiter and was awed by the view of the Bellagio Fountain. If you're looking for a romantic night out with your significant other and wanted to splurge a little, this would be the spot.  Ask for the window seating to get a better view of the Bellagio fountain.",
