I won't be back and that is too bad because it was good food. Yuck! Grossed out",

We got the in-between size and it was way too much for two people, even taking it home we didn't get through it in time.  I think we came on an off night, the website said they were opened for a long time but the server seemed very hesitant about what the chef would make and had to check before everything we inquired about. She was super sweet, though! We'd definitely be back to try another pie.",

    "text": "Good poutine, good service, cheap greasy doughy pizza, really skimpy with toppings - that about sums it up, but keep reading if you feel like it.   The poutine was pretty great and a steal for only $4 - fresh cut crispy fries with salty but good peppery gravy and generous amount of cheese. I could be wrong, but they seem to use mozzarella chunks, not cheese curds, which were also cold. The meal started out really well. Then came the pizzas...  We got small Guinea and Back Home Pies. Online pricing is wrong btw they were $13 each not $12, but even the wee size was pretty big. You can easily feed 2 with the wee because of how filling the super thick crust is. It was like an equally greasy, but not as crispy version of Pizza Hut pan pizza.   They're really generous with the cheese, but stingy as hell with the toppings. This 2nd location recently opened, but don't believe the older pics from the Arville location or their online menu pics, it's super misleading. What they show on one slice is about what you get on half the pizza. The Guinea pie had MAYBE half a meatball on the entire thing, but was loaded with ricotta, mozzarella and spinach. Really dumb because the meatball is cheaper than the cheeses. The moisture from all that spinach also made the crust really soggy. The Guinea sounded awesome, but wasn't. The garlic white sauce also was extremely bland.   Back Home was a little better - crust was super crispy in the beginning, but soggy after the first piece. Again, really generous with cheese, and short on sausage and pepperoni. It was better than the Guinea, but still not very good - soggy pretty quickly and literally dripping with grease.   Service was great even though there was only 1 person doing the counter, phone orders and playing waitress. She was sweet and attentive.   Also their tables are ridiculously small. Do not sit at a 2 top because the pizza pan takes up basically the entire table. They need to invest in the stands that most other pizza places have.   I would return for take out on poutine and to try their loaded fries, and maybe the sandwiches. But I am not at all a fan of their pizza. I'd recommend this place if you're with a group and looking for value, but keep in mind that you're only filling up on bread and grease. I'd rather pay more for a smaller, better quality pizza.",

Served with an equal portion of bitchiness. Even asking a question about a menu item will probably get you a snide remark. As a former server, I can promise you you'll make more money in tips without being a snot to everyone who walks through the door. The food here is good and people will come! I'll be back, but next time, I'm getting my order to go.   I would give this place a solid four stars on food, but you lose one thanks to employee offensiveness.  Downtown New Yorkers might feel right at home with the attitude. Thanks to another review, we were prepared for \"icy service,\" not an exaggeration in the slightest.",

Food - shared the chicken wing dip. Very good. Nice chunks of chicken and the cheese to buffalo sauce ratio is good. A little greasy but the super fluffy and soft dough you dip it in is from the angels :)  Also had a slice of cheese pizza ( we do this across many pizza platforms to gauge quality ). A good mix of cheese flavors. Cannot go wrong with it.  Shared the 1/3 sheet guinea pie. Not overly garlicy and a good helping of their ricotta on the fluffy dough. The meat is also not super spicey (which I enjoy). A quality pizza with good ingredients. Cannot find this in a typical cheese or pepperoni joint.",

I didn't care for the sauce; it still had that \"aluminum\" taste (or maybe it's just me) that most places are able to mask a little better.  Pepperoni pizza: we ordered the 1/4 sheet, the smallest pizza they serve, and it was still a little too much for the two of us. I really liked the toppings and the crust; the crust was chewy, buttery, and soft, the pepperoni were insanely good and got that little bit of crisp around the edges. I almost bought some pepperoni to take home, but it was something insane, like $10 for a pint. Yikes.  The only tiff I had about the service was that the garlic buns and the pizza arrived within a moment of one another. I hate not having any time to enjoy my appetizer before my entree comes. It takes away from the appetizer. Everything was good, but not great.   Pros: Cost effective.  Good pizza.   Cons:  The furniture was a bit wobbly?",

Well the pizza tasted good and the wings were just alright nothing to rave over  Now I'm guessing the wings were just alright, reason being most likely undercooked.

Hours later both shitting our guts out, super nauseous and then later in the night puking up everything left in our stomachs, couldn't eat for the rest of the day  Wouldn't think so much if it just happened to one of us but to two people at the same exact time?

Customers come and go, 20 minutes later I'm still standing there. I keep looking over and making eye contact with the girl at the desk who took my order to make sure it wasn't ready. She's there having a long personal conversation with some guy. Finally about 5 minutes later (25 minutes or so later) she walks over to me and says \"excuse me sir but are you waiting for something?\". Are you serious? You're the one who took my order! So I tell her what I ordered (which was just a simple order of suicide fries) and she's goes and picks up the box that I saw the cook sit down 15 minutes prior and hands it to me. No apologies or anything. Her reply was \"well we had a lot of orders I can't remember everyone's face\". I'M THE ONLY PERSON STANDING IN THE RESTAURANT BESIDES THE GUY WHOS TAKING THE ATTENTION. AWAY FROM YOU DOING YOUR JOB! If my time isn't valuable to you then I won't bother.

The pizza and wings are really reminiscent of the pizza places I grew up with in the north town suburbs (Santoras, Picassos, Marvinos, Raymondos, etc).  \"Buffalo style\" pizza is unique and really hard to find outside of WNY.  I've lived all across the US and road tripped almost all 50 states and can't say that any other region has anything like it, but Naked City nails the crust, cheese and toppings (specifically, the little pepperoni that curl up when baked and act like delicious little oil cups).  I haven't tried much else beyond the pizza and mild/medium/hot wings & fingers (anything else isn't really a Buffalo Wing in my book), but I'll be back time and again just for that little taste of home.",

You really feel the comfort and love. The suicide fries are the best french fries I have ever had. The service is good and it's just a simple place to try some delicious food. Anytime I'm in Vegas you will catch me there.",

    "text": "I've lived in Vegas for a little over a year now, and up until this point, was disappointed with all of the pizza places I've been to. For the most part, the local places all serve pizza with really thin crust, but I like a med or thick crust pizza. Naked City Pizza is the first place I've been to that had a really good medium thickness crust, and the sauce is great as well. I usually just get plain cheese, and I get the \"Not so wee\" size, which is pretty big and goes for $13.00. I've also tried their pizza that had veggies and white sauce, it was pretty good, but I'm not a huge fan of white sauce. I've also tried their suicide fries a couple times. I'm a fan of freakishly spicy food, I think they taste great, and I give it around a 7 on the heat scale. The staff is also very friendly, and the service is prompt. I live walking distance, so I usually call ahead of time, and my order is ready within 10 minutes of me placing it. Naked City Pizza is highly recommended and by far my favorite pizza in Las Vegas.",

    "text": "We called in the to-go order at 6:15pm and a nice lady answered, took our order. There were two of us wanting to eat. We ordered a 1/4 Guinea pizza and a 10 pc wings-medium heat. Maybe this is just a good day to go. She told us 20-25 minutes, but we waited some extra because people here and on other review sites said they were very slow. We got there at maybe 6:45 or 6:50. The pizza and wings were ready to go. Not sure how long they had sat there but still were warm. So it had been ready on time. The restaurant was not crowded at all. So they did well on the service time. We got home and had our wings, which were hot. I am used to heat, I do eat jalapenos and 'hot' wings so not a big deal. But if they didn't mess up, and if that is how hot and spicy there medium sauce is, then beware if you cannot handle the heat. Wings are the 'wet' style, so have plenty of napkins ready. The guinea pizza was very good. We had sausage added as an extra, and I would recommend this. It is a white sauce pizza, garlic, cheese and meatballs too. Very good.  For two grown men, the 1/4 pizza was enough food. We got too much, and ate too much, by getting the wings. As for there not being crowds, and there not being a wait time, maybe we got lucky on the time and day we went. Not sure. But the place looked clean and the lady that got our pizza was super nice. I would go again.",

    "text": "Went for lunch, very disappointing. Service was perfect, friendly and helpful. everything else was downhill. The seating is the worst I've experienced in a long time - super low tables. Every time I moved my legs I thought I was going to tip the table. It is no place for a full sized man.  I ordered wings and I asked for them to be hot, a slice of pepperoni pizza and a small beef, cheese and peppers sandwich. The wings were perfectly cooked with good crispy exterior but very under seasoned and under sauced too. I asked for hot and they were the mildest wings I've ever had plus very little sauce was on them. I noticed that the plate they were served on only had a few specks of sauce left on it when I'd finished the wings. The pizza was not at all for my taste. The crust was very bready and doughy, soft and limp. The sauce had a very nice bright tomato flavor but no other flavor - no taste of spice, herbs etc., one dimensional and bland. the cheese was abundant but rubbery and the pepperoni was warmed thru w/o any bit of char. It tasted like it needed more time in an oven or like it was microwaved. It was boring and bland. The sandwich came wrapped in paper which seemed weird for an order that wasn't to go.I had the sandwich last and I think the paper wrapping made the bun steam a bit. By the time I ate it, the bun was soft on the outside where it should have had some crusty texture. Was not appealing. The meat was grey, dry, featureless, unseasoned and the little bit of cheese seemed like an afterthought.  The sandwich as a whole tasted of peppers and little else, like the other two items, totally bland and boring. . I tried three items and all three were bland, boring, poorly executed. Think hospital food.  Also, very uncomfortable seating. Wont return.",

The dough and the toppings were all so good together.   We also got the loaded potato fries and the stuffed mushrooms. While they were both delicious,  the mushrooms were my favorite!

Concerning the toppings, they are really good but the amount was sadly super skimpy. Iv'e seen more toppings on a personal pizza than this one had and we ordered the 1/2 sheet. The waitress was pretty dam efficient. Water was kept filled, came by frequently to see if we needed anything. Although I can see how she might be the one others have mentioned who has an attitude.

There was one other person here so I would think she would be happy to get another tip but it didn't seem Like that. Cute young girl but not friendly at all. There are so many places to go so I'd suggest hiring friendly people or training them to be nice. I'm a local that loves the food but not sure this service deserves my business.",

This pizza was the Guinea pie, instead of spinach had them add pepperoni and it blew my socks off. Everything about the pizza was delicious.  Originally wanted my normal of pepperoni and sausage, but Alas, all out of sausage. The alternative was probably more delicious!  Today they had computer issues and everything was a little wonky, but the food more than made up for it.  Will be returning!",

The Buffalo-style pizzas are made in a rectangular pan like Sicilian pizzas, but with a thinner crust. You can get them plain or loaded with a wide variety of toppings that includes everything from bar food like chicken fingers, sirloin steak and meatball.   The pizzas are huge and I ordered a personal size, six huge pieces I was lucky to finish three.    I ordered the popular GUINEA PIE - Meatballs, Spinach, Ricotta, Spinach, Ricotta, White Garlic Sauce and Mozzarella. The slices are gooey messy cheesy, fattening and delicious, easily one of the best I have had from a hole-in-wall pizza place.  The other item I noticed on the appetizer menu is the MEATBALL SKILLET which is seriously out of this world good. The meatballs were nice and caramelized holding in all the flavors.     The service was awesome, staff was very nice. I enjoyed Naked City Pizza and I can't wait till they open there third location near Henderson.",

I looked at the menu and was actually enticed by a few things like chicken wing dip and the pizza logs. I'm from Buffalo and just moved out here a couple years ago so I was excited I found a place that made those types of things. I ordered a delivery and saw the estimated wait time was 60-70min. I was like okay, no problem. At least it will be here by the time my other half leaves for work so he could take something with him.  Well, he couldn't even do that.  The delivery itself took over 2 hours which is ridiculous especially on a Monday. My delivery guy wasn't that friendly as well. No apology either.  I opened up my food and my chicken wing dip wasn't even close to being a dip. It literally was chicken fingers sticking on to burnt cheese and that's it. I couldn't even dip the bread in it. The pizza logs weren't logs either. They were just lumpy eggshells covered in grease with barely any filling in them. No pizza sauce with them either.  The only positive was my Philly eggrolls because I can at least see the filling on both side. I feel like I wasted 50 bucks and I couldn't even eat anything out of it.  I'm not impressed. I will not be ordering at the paradise location again.",

I can tell you this place is definitely a dive.  Floors were dirty, along with the tables.  We finally ordered a half sheet (12 slices) of the Guinea pie.  1/2 hour later our pizza arrived and it was very delicious.  I'll take off a bit because the meatballs on the pizza were dry and lacked flavor, but overall, pizza was great.  While we were eating we noticed this man, who definitely looked like a homeless person come in and start sweeping the floors.  I thought perhaps the employee gave him a few bucks to help her out.  When we left there was another homeless person outside with a shopping cart, apparently just waiting for ???perhaps the guy inside.  Maybe next time we can try the Arville location.",

    "text": "My boyfriend hails from Buffalo/Niagara Falls, NY, so we are always on the lookout for places in Vegas with pizza that reminds him of home.  We came upon Naked City, the Paradise location on Yelp.  Here is our interesting experience...  It was a bit hidden as other Yelpers pointed out, but we found it and parked in the dimly lit parking lot surrounded by dive bars.  My son, bf, and I went in and were promptly greeted by a friendly hostess.  The restaurant is on the smaller side, but not cramped at all.  Freshly painted and I loved their wooden tables, although my bf is over 6' tall so he felt the table a little low for his knees.  Great music selection playing, mix of oldies and classic rock and black and white photos adorning the walls.   The server was warm and funny, we liked her right away. We ordered the poutine, the buffalo wings, and a half sheet of pizza, half with pepperoni, half cheese.  My man was glad to see they had Gennessee ale.  Poutine was delicious. Crispy fries, warm salty gravy, chunks of melty cheese, what's not to love?  My bf didn't, but he doesn't know what he's talking about.  Buffalo wings....wiiiiinnnngggss. Yum.  Perfect crisp combination of meaty wing and medium sauce that was enough to make me die happy.   Now... here's where the story goes a lil south.  An obviously very drunk, loud man entered and sat down yup, right next to us. He loudly states to no one that he's waiting for a pizza to go with \"meat...all the meat!\" He looks over at us and says hi to my bf who gamely engages in small talk with him, during which he asks for one of our wings.  My bf politely declines.   Now time seemed to stretch on into infinity with us waiting for our pizza and Drunkie Drunkface waiting for his.  In this time he continued to slur to my very hard of hearing son, learned some sign language, and insulted where I'm from.  Our pizza came first, and was fantastic.  Crust was thick as I read in other reviews, but a pizza with that much stretchy, flavorful cheese requires a sturdy, fluffy crust that can stand up to it and show it who's boss.  The sauce was good, and in perfect proportion to the cheese and crust.  Drunkie is staring slack jawed and unabashed at our pizza like he was gonna wrestle it from our hands.  I tell my bf to let him have a wing. He was so happy, munching away.  Once we were full (which was quick since we basically inhaled the pizza) we gave Drunkie the rest of our wings, and waited for the server to come with the bill. She didn't come. And I was so ready to be done.   TBH, I felt like she was avoiding eye contact with us, knowing this guy was there and she didn't want to deal with confrontation.  Okay, I don't blame her... a lot. So we said our goodbyes and carried our remaining pizza up to the counter for a box and to pay.  I informed the server we had entertained Drunkie for our entire meal and asked if there could be a discount involved and she said, \"I know. I'm so sorry.\" And discounted us 10% (which we incorporated in her tip anyway).  It was VERY nice of her to do that, but I would've rather enjoyed my delectable meal in mozzarella filled peace.  And that my friends, is the only reason for the 4 instead of 5 stars.  I would definitely do it again, maybe to-go next time, but believe me that food is worth it all!",

I am rooting that they can overcome that problem. It is clear that they use top quality ingredients in their pizza. Cheese that is soft and gooey, tomato sauce that your grandmother would envy and sausage that is superior to any chain store. I would also recommend the Hamslaw sandwich. A good old fashioned hero that you wont find anywhere else. My only complaint was that the dishes do not come out together. The server brings them out one at a time and it is awkward to have entrees for half the party and wait for the rest. (I have seen this complaint on another review) That should be easily corrected.",

    "text": "So im on a mission to eat at as many triple D restaurants as possible. When I found myself in Vegas i thought I would try this out because hey who doesn't love pizza?! So I decided to go with the wee guinea pizza but swapped the meatballs for their house made Italian sausage and a glass of flavored iced tea. The tea was ok initially tasted weird as I was expecting pain tea but it grew on me.  Now the pizza. Oh the pizza. I consider myself somewhat of a foodie. I love good food and I'm willing to pay to get it. Initially I want too impressed with the pizza and almost asked for some dipping sauce but decided against it. Best choice I ever made. I slid that streaming hot piece of pie into my plate and hesitantly took a small bite so as not to burn my mouth off. Oh man, let me tell you, this pizza is amazing! The crust is thick ava chewy and cooked just right n the toppings do something magical and definitely check you onto the train to flavor town, express route! The homemade sausage is to die for! Very spicy but oh so good! And they put several large pieces. I definitely think two could share the wee pizza.  I will be back here next time I'm in Vegas and next time I'm bringing a friend so we can split and try more. The fries looked fresh cut and delicious but I salt didn't have any room left to try them.  Service was impeccable. No issues there.  Now stop reading this and come here now and eat this pizza.",

It was well past midnight eastern time and approaching midnight Vegas time but we had to try Naked City. I was on a mission.  Since we hadn't eaten all day, the plan was to try multiple items and we definitely achieved that goal. Shannon, our server, was friendly and professional and took care of us even though it was clear we were over ordering for just the two of us.  We started with an orange flavored ice tea and a craft beer to wet our appetite. Then, to the infamous suicide fries! Spicy and delicious! Garlic fries with extra garlic? Yes, I believe we'll have that too! Unfortunately, it still needed more garlic! Or, could it be that we damaged our taste buds on the suicide fries? A chopped salad without garlic or hot peppers to round out the meal? Why not? It was super tasty, with the addition of a bit of salt and pepper.  A huge Guinea Pie to enjoy? El Freakin' Yummo in a uniquely-garlicky-kind-of-way. This pillowy-soft flavorful pizza has to be tried!  All in all, we had a great meal and leftovers for a few more! Thanks Naked City!",

    "text": "First time here for lunch today. We were excited to give this place a try after seeing pics and reading the reviews. Especially after reading they were on DDD on Food Network (one of my faves)! Started off with the poutine and meatballs. The poutine was okay (but not as good as Lola's or Blind Pig) and so was the meatball appetizer. They were out of the NY style pizza dough so we ordered the Sicilian. I'd rate the pizza 4 out of 5, but the starters were closer to 3.5. We'd probably come back for the pizza but try other things on the menu.   Service was good. There was only 1 server and she had to tend to a large party, plus 2 other tables, but it wasn't too bad.   Kind of in a weird location and I probably wouldn't feel safe going here at night, unless I was with a group.",

Now while there was absolutely no drop off of service or overall expectation of the Arville location I have to say parking is a serious problem. If you come in off the main street you will drive in against parking indicators and then turn around in the tiny lot and park. Of course turning the corner and entering from the side makes sense, but good luck driving anything bigger than a Volkswagen through the lot. The Pizza was everything you would want, and I still say it's still the best Pizza in Vegas. It's just a lot harder to get to. One less Star for parking aggravation.",

    "text": "Here's a shocker: The best pizza in Vegas is not on the Strip. Yes, I know you're gobsmacked, but it's True and Naked City Pizza is the proof. I usually don't pay that much attention to the Triple-D man, Guy Fieri, the man who single-handedly destroyed the Food Network, but occasionally some places he recommends are actually good. One was Broken Record back in San Francisco, but this may be his best find yet. This isn't the one he went to either as another Naked City Pizza, presumably the original location, is on the other side of the Strip in the back of a dive bar on Arville. Now that sounds like Triple D. Off the hook, dude.  This one is in a makeshift office building on the way to the airport which is exactly why Jamie W. and I ended up here. It wasn't crowded at about 5PM, just one ravenous family next to the window. The paper menu was a bit tattered, but we thought everything they offered appeared quite tempting. We decided the share the $7.50 Naked Salad, a bargain that combined iceberg lettuce, spinach, roasted sweet peppers, white onion, marinated tomato, and shredded mozzarella, all of it tossed in a housemade vinaigrette (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1RCNyjX&s=0084c5088f83864238a3cc654e65fe3f6db39069ffef0812e8faa9d2066b3d1d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/1RCNyjX</a>). It was that tangy dressing along with the fresh ingredients that made this salad really hit the spot.  Because of the subheader description, \"Featured on Food Network's DDD\",  the Guinea Pie was our pizza of choice. It's made the old-fashioned Sicilian way in a rectangular, cookie-sheet shape with a soft, aerated dough that was quite amazing. The main topping was what they referred to as Grandma's Meatballs, which looked to be sliced and mixed with mint, accompanied by baby spinach leaves, heaping spoonfuls of ricotta, mozzarella and white garlic sauce. We decided to go for the $14.95 quarter sheet, which was plenty since it consisted of six hefty pieces (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1QoTOco&s=999804ef05e5532b4054dc307d9aea21f9b8cc97c018f31df03dee496b3e45de\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/1QoTOco</a>). I think that dough could have handled any topping, but the white-on-white, Buffalo-style combination worked really well. OK, it was off the hook.  FOOD - 5 stars...genuinely exceptional pizza with a crust that really stands out AMBIANCE - 3 stars...nothing special but certainly clean SERVICE - 3.5 stars...initially a bit icy but warmed up as we shared our praise of the pizza TOTAL - 5 stars...really unique pizza well worth getting out of the casino for",

Parking was probably the only major negative point as its small and annoying.  We ended up ordering their frickin' huge pepperoni pizza which, as the name suggests, was FRICKIN' HUGE! With the pizza we ordered a couple of fries where were basic but good to much on as the pizza came out. Garlic Fires came out on the cooler side which was disappointing but the regular ones were nice and hot.   Service was also steady. Its a smaller place so they only had one server, which I could see becoming a problem if the place was packed but our experience was fine.   Look forward to making another visit next time i'm in Vegas.",

You can deliver solid food, but if you can't deliver on service consistently then the food will only carry you so far.   We came in and where immediately greeted by a female employee obviously suffering from a bad day...but from what I could tell from the other patrons we were not the only ones suffering from from her bad mood. Either way we were committed and wants to try out these pies. First disappointment 2 beers on tap? 2nd the appetizer we ordered the Philly egg rolls...these were Meh at best. Very greasy and not much flavor. But we were not here for the appetizers and here for the pizza. So after not too long of a wait out came the pizza...we ordered Guninea  pizza and the Margherita 1/4 sheets both were very solid choices. This is what we came in for but isn't deserving of a 4 or a 5 star just because nothing else really delivered. I would be willing to give this place another try and hope that our service was a one time fluke.",

I had made reservations the week before and upon arrival, an employee began putting tables together for our large party. Service was spotty, but everyone was a fan of the specialty pizzas we ordered. A huge crowd pleaser was actually a beer that tasted like blueberries (#4 on the beer menu).   MARGHERITA: Not a single slice was left! This was probably among the best margherita pies I've ever had. The pizza tasted incredibly fresh and the crust was perfect. Awesome for vegetarians or those who prefer non-meaty pizzas. 5/5  NAKED CITY: Looked colorful and toppings were spread with a heavy hand. My professor loved this pie.   REBEL: I didn't get a chance to snap a pic but this was another popular pie.  VIBE: Oldie music played in the background. The inside of the restaurant is small and cozy. There's a pretty extensive beer menu on a large chalkboard near the entrance. Wine is available, but they only had 2 variations on hand.      *Located across the street from the Double Down Saloon.     Worth a Return Visit?

After my friend heard about naked city we decided to try it out.  We ordered the chicken wing dip, rebel pizza and zeppoles. I was concerned at first about the wing dip because I'm not a blue cheese fan . They do offer ranch as a substitute but the waitress said that the blue cheese taste is no longer noticeable when baked. It was worth the shot, the dish had chunks of chicken and mainly tasted like buffalo sauce. Plus garlic pizza bread was tasty by itself.  The rebel pizza was loaded with tomatoes, sausage and ham. Personally it was a bit salty for my taste but after having a bite of their thick crust and gooey cheese... Oh man.. I knew I would be back.  You HAVE TO get the zeppoles. Warm powdered donuts with chocolate sauce. Do I need to say more? GET IT  Overall, warm cozy environment and good food. What more could you ask for?",

We recently watched Guy visit Naked City Pizza and found out they opened a second location much closer to our hotel and the Las Vegas strip, so we walked down a few blocks to grow our hunger for some pizza!  The place is definitely a dive! Very sports-bar esque theme, especially since the guys seem to be Buffalo Bills fans and have a few TVs in the restaurant. It also isn't very big at all, very close and quaint.   We came by on Sunday around 1pm and there were only two other tables dining in and one worker the front of house running plates and cashier, etc. The worker was very nice and friendly and gave a great run down of the menu, including the sizing stating the small portions feed about 2-4 people and the 1/4 pizza sheets are about the size of the menus. We were also glad to see the menu had notations of which foods Guy Fieri ate so we remember what to order from the show!   For the three of us, we ordered small suicide fries and a 1/4 sheet of the Guinea Pie.  These \"small\" fries are definitely not \"small\"!  Now, I get that these are called \"suicide fries\" and the menu clearly states how they are spiced with habanero and the likes. . . BUT I do wish the waiter had asked if we can handle spicy foods or if we would like ranch/blue cheese or something because these are damn spicy! We didn't even finish half of these but if there was some sort of dip or if the suicide sauce was put on the side, then sure. Overall though, the fries were very crispy and had great seasoning, and the habanero sauce was very flavorful! It had some True flavor other than just being suicidal in spice.   Now for the pizza. This is some damn good pizza!! And the size was pretty big too, bigger than the menu for sure as he had mentioned before we ordered. The crust is thick like pan pizza or best comparison is to BJs restaurants, while also being buttery and crispy in a similar fashion!  The Guinea is topped with house made \"Grandma's\" meatballs, mozzarella, ricotta, white garlic sauce, and spinach! These toppings combine to make such an amazing pizza! The meatballs are juicy and seared nicely, as you bite into them you can actually taste and feel the crust as they were just sauteed on a pan. The flavors are great and very well like grandma's meatballs! There is so.much.delicious.ooey.gooey.cheese. OHMYGOD. Every bite has my pulling the cheese from the crust i LOVE it! The garlic sauce is thick and creamy and has the perfect amount of garlic. The spinach brings it together for a fresh bite with the slight bitterness!  Overall, a fine establishment for food and alcohol pairings and to catch the game! I would love to come back for both the fries and pizza, but to be sure I get some ranch with those fries next time!",

It was extremely cheesy, full of flavor and the toppings were great! My only negative comment would be that the pizza could've been more crispy. Kinda soggy in the center pieces. We ordered the Rebel pizza. We all agreed that we will order from here again!",

I personally feel it is bad business and it frankly pisses me off. I don't know you and your in my bubble). Only complaints are that they served can soda, didn't even offer a glass of ice, the fries are amazing but had no salt, and about half way through this gigantic burger ( have to use a knife and fork to eat it) the seasonings in the meat become way over powering. But just ask for more lettuce slaw and your good to go, if you even finish it!",

Most appetizers are also cooked in the oven, so they gave us some loaded baked potato fries on the house. These were amazing!  We ordered a margherita pizza which was NOT amazing.  The crust is pretty thick (so if you like that you'll be happy), but the sauce was really thick and strong in flavor.....and in my opinion a margherita pizza shouldn't be offered with this type of crust.",

Started out going to the wrong place the one on Arville not meant for kids, but the were courteous and pointed us in the right direction to the place on Paradise. We drove by it the first time. It is kind of hidden but on one way street on left hand side, and if you take the first left to go around the block, then technically you're there, just need to pull in liquor store parking lot. Anyway, we walked in, maybe a bad sewage day, but it smelled really bad and it almost turned us around, but we stuck it out. We ordered the Guinea Pie, it was awesome, crust was amazing. The sizes are strange, but waitress very courteous and explained the sizes to us, so we ordered the half wee and it still took us 3 days to eat the rest. My son ordered couple of cheese slices, was so good that when he brought it home, he actually ate his leftovers. My opinion, service was no less or more than I would I would expect anywhere else. The food we ordered was awesome. I would totally recommended it!! Oh yea it is a Buffalo Bills place on Sundays or Game Days",

We walked in and we we're warmly greeted right away.  We had are choice of anywhere we wanted to sit so we took a table in the middle of the room.  The only reason I'm giving them a 4 is because the tables were kinda uncomfortable other wise it's 5 all the way. We were with another couple and we both wanted different pizza toppings so they got a 1/4 sheet of the Rebel which had pepperoni, sausage, ham, salami, tomato and fresh basil while we had a 1/4 sheet of the chitown which was chunks of Italian beef, giardinare and roasted peppers, olive oil and oregano. We also got an order of wings with the Sicilian hot sauce on half and the put bbq on the other half.  We started it all off with the garlic cheese rolls. Think cinnamon roll only pimped out pizza style.  These were awesome and I'd recommend them to anybody.  The pizza is more of a neoploitan style with a thicker crust and made and served on a cookie sheet and cut in big squares.  They had a nice amount of toppings and cheese along with a tasty sauce and an excellent crust. The wings were cooked to perfection and served with a fair amount of celery and carrot sticks all with a really good quality blue cheese and/or Ranch dressing. Both styles were great but I thought the BBQ was outstanding. We quickly realized we could have easily gotten away with ordering 1 pizza and 1/2 the wings and had more then enough food. Our server was super cute and friendly and gave us great service so it made our visit even better.  All and all this was a great lunch selection and we were very happy.  I'm a big fan of getting off the strip and eating locally where the prices are better and the people are real.",

    "text": "Pizza= cold with an abundance of cold cheese and lackluster dough. A simple cheese slice with sweet peppers should have tasted better and at least been hot (in temp.). It was not. 3 slices and a starter of stuffed banana peppers came out in reverse order; slices  first?? Not only did this occur in weird fashion, but the slices were clearly made before the starter was finished so they just brought them out to prevent them getting cold....well that was a fail because I bit into huge clumps of cold cheese and lukewarm sauce on dough that had little taste. I believe the slice wasn't even cooked long enough because it lacked the browning bubbles that cheese gets when browned.   When the starter finally arrived, it was stuffed Anaheim chiles and NOT yellow banana or Hungarian peppers. A big let down when the menu states what they were supposed to be and the two peppers are very different in taste. Moreover, it was clear that the peppers were charred quickly then stuffed, and not baked with the stuffing leaving the peppers still crisp/raw and not cooked enough. This was also a lukewarm item placed atop a bed of COLD ranch dressing? Supposedly white garlic sauce but definitely was ranch dressing. Gross. And two peppers for $9.50 is not pizza joint price.  Overall, the food was less than mediocre and the service was slow for being the ONLY diners.   Won't return",

    "text": "This review is only for the one catering experience I recently had. I absolutely LOVE this Pizza. I've gone to this restaurant a few times and always love dining in. So naturally when I planned to host 40 of my closest clients, I chose Naked City.  I called in at least 3 weeks in advance for my order. Of course I had to call back as they do not return calls when they tell you they will.  They're busy.. fine I'll let that slide.  2 weeks before I place my order for 3 full tray pizzas and a large salad, they said it's a large order they had no problem delivering it to my venue. Perfect.  Days before my event, I called to change one pizza from pepperoni to a more veggie white pizza instead.  I've probably talked to the same catering contact 4 times by now!  Day of my event, 7pm start time, requested delivery was set for 7pm.  I get a call from a CA number at 6:30 which I happen to miss because I of course  am too busy setting up for my party.  Another missed call at 6:45, same number. Finally i check my messages to find out it's the catering man. He wants my credit card to charge BEFORE he can come deliver. By this time it's 7pm.   I call back and pay so he can bring my food while my friends are starving. He arrives 20 min late and all my Pizza is cold. The Guinea (my fav) is also burnt looking and most people didn't even touch it. The salad I asked them not to toss dressing on was tossed anyways and inedible so that went straight to the trash. Of course I had a party to entertain so I called back to let them know how upset I was and hoping they would offer a credit or something, but nothing. He was busy also And asked me to call back... great chasing him down again, no thanks.  Lesson learned - dine in only",

    "text": "We tried the famous Guinea pie, 2 regular slices, the meatball appetizer and wings. Overall we sort of enjoyed our meal but the meatballs were not my favorite at all. The meatballs were too thick sliced and really dense for the Guinea Pie which made it odd to eat. When biting into the pie everything was soft and easy to bite into except when biting into a meatball. It was dense and hard and ruined the pie for me, I pulled most of the meatball off or avoided biting into it. Fiance said the same about his meatball appetizer.   Wings at most establishments disappoint me as we are very particular about very crispy well done wings, light on the sauce.  Even though we stressed light on the sauce they still were coated generously which resulted in flaccid skin wings. We noticed the table next to us ordering plain wings and they looked pretty crispy and regretted that maybe we just should've got them plain.   Would I come back to Naked City Pizza? Yes I would, I crave Sicilian style pizza once in a while and they do make pizza well, I just will be more careful about the way I order.  Avoiding meatballs and getting the plain wings next time.",

The paradise location was closest to us but our server told us the arville location is the one from the show and is more of a dive while the location we went to is more of a restaurant. Good prices. Our server was very friendly and told us that their most popular orders were the guinea pie and suicide fries. We had both and added the back home pie. The suicide fries were delicious but very very spicy! The guinea was great too (very \"melt in your mouth\" type.) Those pies are freaking filling! Very doughy. One is more than enough. They have a list of craft beers as well. I took stars off because the back home had a weird tomato sauce that I did not enjoy. What we got was good but not the most amazing pizza I've had.",

Props for offering local (local Vegas and local Buffalo) beers, but with such a small selection, I couldn't really find one I liked. Prices are good and they have really great specials during NFL games. The tables are low and the chairs are high. So much so that you can't fit your legs underneath. Annoying. On this same note, the decor inside is really simple (no problem there), but it also borders on uncomfortable. Add that to the fact that there's only 2 tvs, and you're not exactly gonna go here to hang out and watch football.",

    "text": "WARNING: If you're a tourist who saw this place on \"Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives\" and you are thinking about coming here, please think again.  NOTE: If you're a local and want to check this place out, please do so at your own peril.  The reason I make this distinction is that I saw a cab pull up with some diners, and I can only surmise that they were wary tourists who saw this place on \"Triple D\" and thought they'd try it out. If that's you, please save your cab fare (or at least spend it on a GOOD \"Triple D\" place, like Four Kegs) and go somewhere else. There are PLENTY of great restaurants in this city, but this ain't one of them.  I've never given a one-star review, and I'm sad to give this one, but it sure is warranted. My husband and I arrived around 6:15 on a Saturday. There was only one other table of customers, and we had to be somewhere by 8, so we thought we were in good shape. The waitress came by and took our order, and I should have known we were in trouble when it took us 10 minutes to get our first beers. I watched the waitress pour our drafts, and she was having a hard time with it. How hard is it to pour a draft?! And she brought them out one at a time, telling us she was \"still pouring\" the other one. (?!)  Then, we waited an hour to get our order: a \"wee\" portion of poutine and a \"wee\" Naked City pizza. I love poutine, but I'm not sure how mozzarella cheese and rosemary figure into the mix. Gravy on fries, yes, but the rest was just weird. And our pizza was certainly nothing to write home about. My husband is a professional cook, and he swears they used pre-packaged dough and canned or frozen toppings (pepperoni, sausage, and green olives). My palate is not that discerning, but I know a Tony's pizza knockoff when I taste it. SO disappointing!  The wait was annoying, but it also didn't help that I had an Entertainment book coupon that I was going to use on the poutine, and it wasn't applied to the bill. (A whopping $4 savings, but still...) We didn't get our food until 7:30 and we had to scram to make our engagement, so I didn't stick around to quibble over the bill. I also didn't stick around to eat much of the food, because it wasn't much worth it anyway. One piece of \"pizza\" and I was done. Thank God we only ordered a small...  The place filled up in the 90 minutes we were there, and I can only feel sorry for the other diners in the place -- especially the tourists who I hope don't judge our town by this sorry dining experience. I'm writing this review 9 hours later, and I just hope they're still not there waiting for their food...",

    "text": "We were staying at Hard Rock Hotel and wanted to find somewhere to eat that had supported the first responders and victims of the Las Vegas shooting. There is a long list of restaurants that have done this, but we chose Naked City Pizza because it was close to our hotel. We are glad we got to stop in here, after we found it of course. So there is a sign on the corner of Paradise and Naples that would lead you to believe the pizza place is in this tiny shopping center on the right side of the road, but all we saw was a cannabis store and a different pizza place. We looked across the street in the other parking lot which was dark, and it appeared to be the back of a cheap motel and then a small building that said Office Bar. We flipped a U turn and tried again. Frustration set in as we really couldn't find it. We turned back onto Paradise and I called them. This is when their customer service started to shine. The young man who answered, I wish I had his name, he walked me through the steps to get back to the location. Well, Naked City Pizza storefront actually faces Paradise instead of Naples, and my only complaint is their sign is pitch black in the evening! As we were walking up there was a guy outside that said this is the best pizza in Vegas, so I had high expectations. We walked in to a fairly small establishment and the guy at the counter I assumed was who I spoke to on the phone, he was wearing a USA hat. He greeted us and seated us. He got our drinks, took our order, and all with a pleasant demeanor. I would say there's less than 12 tables inside with an additional several seats counter height looking out the window. A couple TVs that were playing Thursday Night Football. Mellow crowd.   Our pizza came out about 25 minutes later, I just had a slice of salami and mushrooms, the salami was in little squares, I liked it. I'm a round table pizza kind of girl but this pizza was good. Fiance got 1/4 pan of the \"Rebel\" which was 6 giant squares almost too much for his 6'3\" 240 pound frame. His review: he's coming back. The crust and ingredients all standouts.   Same guy that originally helped us was on top of refilling our drinks and answering our questions. when we were leaving we spoke to him and another guy about the reason we came to eat here. He told us more about what the company had done for the victims including other locations and fundraising.   We visit Vegas often from Reno and this is now on our list of food stops.",

A pizza with absolutely 0 sauce. Zero. Really. So my mom calls this joint and explains the situation and how extra sauce must of got interpreted as no sauce. So strange. The manager that evening asked my mom to take a picture to be certain of the pizza delivered had no sauce lol. She offered us to go and pick up another one. Ummm yeah,  no thank you. Customer service is lacking and I hope they choose to rev up the anty. After the 3rd pizza gone wrong and it not being not as nearly as good as they have been- - my parents won't be coming back to this location.

But, I am a lover of all pizza, so I went ahead and gave it a shot with an open mind.  It was about 8pm on a Saturday night, and the place was pretty full, minus a few spots on the counter which was where we were sat. We were given menus and asked what we want to drink and all that jazz. The server was hustling solo and she made sure to check on us as we took our time ordering beer and selecting a pizza.   I opted for a Joseph James IPA that went perfectly with the sausage and pepperoni pizza with a garlic crust. Did you hear me?! Garlic crust. Buttery, parmesany, crunchy, yes soft inside, (did I mention buttery?) garlic crust. I was in love.   This isn't the best pizza I have had in Vegas, or in my life, but it's a perfect spot for a slice, or a whole pie before, during, or after drinks. So for that, I thank you Naked City.",

The Suicide Fries are a \"try once\" kind of thing. I LOVE hot and spicy food, I order 8 or higher at most Thai restaurants, but these things were so hot and spicy you couldn't taste anything beyond that, just hot! You gotta get the Guinea!!!! It is a thick crust pie, \"buffalo style\",  a white pie with meatball and basil.... YES!!!! There is absolutely nothing wrong with this pizza! The only reason I gave this location a four and not a five star is the service and experience.  Maybe we caught them on a bad night.... but it took over an hour for food to get to the table. A couple of glasses of wine helped to pass the time, and the waiter kept apologizing telling us they had a big carry out order....anyway.... I will definitely be back for the food!",

Our waitress was awesome, sassy and covered in Mickey Mouse tattoos. Just loved her! We ordered the stuffed mushrooms and Back Home specialty pizza.  The creamy sauce that came with the mushrooms was so heavenly, we were wiping our crust in it. The mushrooms were so good, we were sad when they were gone. The rectangular pizza had a light, garlicky crust and super fresh toppings. We ate it all, and it was huge! I don't know what else to say...just go there!",

We walked in and the staff seemed very friendly. The manager ( from the Arville location) was our server. She was friendly, and very helpful ordering.  We ordered a Wee sized Cheese pizza with Basil.

Finished it with Zeppolones, a fried dough dessert. Also screaming but way too many are included.   I gave it 4 stars because they didn't have the football game on because they don't have cable.

    "text": "So, after trying Naked City Pizza at their original location on the other side of town, and having visions of the Guinea Pie dancing through my head ever since, I decided to try their new location on Paradise Rd.  Unlike its sister store, this venue does not share its interior with a dive bar; this is purely a pizza restaurant.  There is no smoking, and no bar.  They don't serve hard alcohol, just beer and wine.  When you enter, the friendly staff at the counter ask if you prefer to dine in or take out.  If dining in, they seat you in their small cluster of tables and provide waitress service.  If takeout, you place and pay for your order at the register and wait until it is ready.  The space is pleasantly appointed, but it lacks character.  It just feels sterile, somehow.  I guess you could hang out here with your friends for a while, but for some reason it lacks that comfortable hang-out vibe that fun restaurants and bars have.  Note, however, that they just opened a few weeks ago, so as they settle in to the space, perhaps that will evolve.  So the important question is: did the great Guinea Pie pizza survive the transplant to the new location?  Or is it a pale imitation of the original?  I am pleased to report that it is just as good as I remember it.  They also have a nice selection of microbrew beers; I was driving, so I didn't get to try any, but it looked promising.    The parking lot is a bit of a mess; the spaces are angled backwards from Paradise Rd, so you have to circle around the corner to the entrance on Naples Drive (or, you could pull into a space backwards, I suppose).  Also, they share the lot with Office Bar next door, so it can get quite full.",

This was a little thicker than that and not something I would typically have ordered, but they make it work, mostly because of the quality ingredients, from the tangy sauce to the cheese to the toppings. Few things:  The half sheet is a huge square cut monster that'll feed a large family The wings are awesome, enough by themselves to bring me back.   I will definitely come back to try their sandwiches, especially the East coast standard beef on weck",

Both pack a mouth full of flavor multiple layers of flavors. You won't see all the original menu items from the original shop on on Desert inn & Arville. But a great way to shake up the menu. This location is family friendly kids are able to come in this location. Great chicken wings and fingers. For a new twist try the Italian wings or fingers. They also serve local beer a great way to support local companies",

I ordered a slice it took overv 25 minutes. second order was a slice and fries my slice was burnt and hard fries overcooked. gave them a third try because I like the food I just ordered fries and once again overcooked. I called TO GIVE THEM FEEDBACK telling them I was unsatisfied with order they claim they would give me a free slice next time without even asking my name. I wont be going there any more, not only was my food messed up, the employees are not friendly at all just asking for order no eye contact, no smile no nothing. I feel like I am ordering from a robot. used to be thumbs up. definitely thumbs down now, not only are they letting there food quality go down, they have no customer service skills anymore either.",

Quick.and friendly, our waitress was on top of it. Small dinning area with two giant TVs and a chalk board beer list (which was pretty impressive). The pizza was great! A 1/4 sheet was plenty for the two of us and we spent less then $20. Will certainly visit again next time we are in Vegas!",

Had some friends in town and good pizza seemed like the common thought, we came here to get a good pizza that wasn't a 'normal chain' type place.  We ordered two pizza's and they were both just ok, and the staff here was not as bad as the other location but it amazes me in such a small place such as this that your drinks being empty for extended periods of time as well as the one waitress not being seen in the dining room for extended periods of time.  I will order to go from the other location before I do this stop again.  I'm assuming the drinking and the proximity to UNLV is what keeps this location open.",

So we thought we give it a try and boy we were in for a surprise. We had Poutine which we never had before and all I have to say is it's was to die for. We also ordered a full sheet of half pepperoni and cheese pizza that also was some good a$$ pizza. We also tried the Guinea Pie that was off the hook. This was the best tasting pizza we had in Las Vegas. I had to order some to fly back to NM to have my family try. They all agreed it was some kick a$$ pizza hot or cold. I plan on visiting again and will recommend this pizza place to friends and family who plan on visiting the 702!! Guy Fierro wasn't joking!!!",

Now its not papa john prices, but once you have a taste you know why. We started with Garlic Roles and they are great. soft stringy cheese warm cheese inside and dip in sauce.  We had the naked city a and Margarita Pizza 1/4 tray on each was more then enough for the four of us.You know a good  mozzarella  when it stretches more then a foot. All the topping are fresh tasting and full of flavor. Some might say there are not enough toppings, but their topping have a great full flavor you don't need it loaded. The crust was good and a perfect fit for the pizza, no issues here.  Now it is a bit slow, but you are getting a True hand crafted Pizza, not a mega chain assembly line that is made for a 12 year soccer team party.",

VERY COOL ! but when we got to our destination and opened the boxes, the pizza lacked and the fries sucked (see pic)...... and my mom lives 6 miles down the road and they want me to turn around and bring back the food even though I told them I took pics? The wings were very good but the crust on the pizza really lacked.. So I call them up to see what can be done about my dissatisfaction: The staff on the phone explained their policy.....\"Ya gotta bring back the pizza and fries mostly uneaten with your receipt\"... even though I took pics ?... all I asked for was a partial credit on the pizza and full refund on the fries. All together with sides I spent $62.00. I will not return to this location but I will go back to my rat hole on Arville and Desert inn.... Maybe bad day for cook and they make pie differently down there.... I will never again go to this location.",

Chicken wing pieces mixed with cheese and other ingredients with a side of grilled flatbread. That was $10. We asked what the lunch specials were and got the 2 slices and a drink for $7 which was a great deal considering it only took one of the huge slices to get me full. We ordered the Guinea pizza. At first I wasn't a fan of the ricotta but the more I ate it, the more I could taste all the flavors which made a great combination. The server was so nice and helpful. I'll definitely be back!",

If you want no cigarettes, quiet relaxed restaurant, come to this location. If you want a good place to watch a game, with a full bar, etc then go to the other location.  No matter which location you choose, the food will be delicious! I know their highlight is the pizza, but don't be afraid to try out some of the daily specials too. Chris is an actual chef, not just a pizza cook. He always has interesting items that include things like homemade pasta, truffles etc. Go for it!",

At that moment, with the servers miserable attitude and the flat soda, we should have known this was going to be a huge let down.  We've been here many times, NCP is in our top three pizza restaurants. We love the Sicilian style fingers and always order them. Last night, they were served to us somewhere between room temperature and cold. Not even lukewarm. They were soggy. They didn't appear or taste fresh at all. Then the ultra-friendly waitress informed us there was a problem with the pizza, and it had to be remade. It was a 1/4 sheet pepperoni pizza. I'm not sure what could go wrong with a one topping pizza but ok. We'll wait.  I guess the people sitting at the next table were done waiting for their order as they just got up and walked out. They had been sitting there for a long time. Then came our pizza. Oh my god. Can't be serious. This is not a naked city pizza. It looked as if it had been deflated. No crust. No height. Looked like a pancake. And this was the remade pizza? What did the first pizza look like? The crust, which is usually thick, fluffy, crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside was thin & rubbery.  I'm not sure how the kitchen & wait staff can serve this pizza and charge for it knowing it's not even close to being right. And to act like it's normal and provide no explanation for what went obviously wrongTotal and complete disappointment. I can't even imagine ever returning to this location. We were literally shocked at what we were served.   I left two stars for what Naked City Pizza used to be.",

    "text": "After hearing wonderful words about Naked Pizza, I finally had the opportunity to see why hours  before attending the Yelp 2018 Elite Badge Day at the Hofbrauhaus on January, 18. It was their Sicilian pizza that led me to write additional wonderful words about Naked Pizza.     Born and raised in New York, I recognize exceptional pizza. In New York, Sicilian pizza is popular. However, in Las Vegas Sicilian pizza is limited to a few establishments. \"What is Sicilian pizza?\" You may be asking. According to Wikipedia:       \"Sicilian pizza is used to describe a typically square variety of cheese pizza with dough over an inch thick, a crunchy base, and an airy interior.\"    According to this review, Naked City saved considerable money and time to savor two slices of Sicilian pizza. In lieu of an $800* round trip flight to New York City, it costed me $9.54 plus a $1 tip to savor the two slices of Sicilian pizza with mushrooms. It was $2.75 per slice plus 50 cents for the toppings. The glass of Coke was $2.50. And after chowing down the Sicilian pizza, I have something to shout out about. \"This hole in the wall pizza restaurant at the resort/ UNLV dividing line practically across from the Hard Rock Hotel gives the typical New York pizzeria Sicilian pizza, a run for their money. The one difference was that this cheese overflowing from the thick square corner slices onto the square white plate was whiter than the Sicilian pizzas that I know of in New York.\"    At the 3 o' clock hour on a Thursday afternoon, business was slow. Upon walking in from the one entrance that faces Paradise Road at the northeast corner with Naples Street**, the man at the counter greeted me. He told me to sit anywhere in the dining room. He brought me the one page menu (shown below). From reading this review, I assume that You would think that Sicilian pizza was my first choice. This isn't the case. If their sandwich menu included the eggplant parmesan sub (in New York called hero), I would have ordered it. After a few minutes, the man returned from the register to take my order. He would make a few additional trips from the register to my table to bring me my glass of Coke, my food, and my check. I rate the service as solid.    The restaurant could be described as a hole in the wall. In my opinion it reminds me more of a College town restaurant at the periphery of a university. A couple of these College town restaurants that come to mind are the former Park Bench outside The State University of New York at Stony Brook and the Bally Hoo by Indiana State University. The reality is that Naked City Pizza is both a College and resort town restaurant. It sits off the Paradise Road corridor which separates the UNLV and Las Vegas Strip Resort District. At any rate, the gray walls are adorned with a flat screen TV, a Buffalo Bills pennant, interesting framed pictures that include family portraits, historic Las Vegas, football, and hockey. Hanging on the window facing Paradise Road is the 2017/18 Golden Knights schedule. Instead of sitting at a bar stool, I sat at one of the wooden tables overlooking the gray walls of pictures.   It is encouraging to see that there are restaurants in Las Vegas that serve the same delectable New York foods that I grew up with. The two slices of Sicilian pizza that I savored in Naked City Pizza live up to those that the typical New York pizzeria had served me.",

    "text": "Came here after a basketball game (with another one coming up), so the 14+ of us were already extremely hungry and on a time schedule. When ordering, we asked how big the salad proportion was, and the guy said \"can serve 2-3 people,\" so my teammate and I decided to each get 1 slice of cheese pizza and share a Caesar salad.   The slice of cheese pizza pleased me very much. It was a HUGE slice (looked like 2 but the other slice orders were just as big). It was delicious! The best part was that it was ONLY $2.75!  The Caesar salad does not feed \"2-3 people.\" It's a good plate for just one person but probably still won't fill you up if you're hungry. Luckily, we ordered one too many salads, so my teammate and I ended up eating our own salad--best mistake we've ever made. The Caesar salad costed $8.50 ($11.50 with Chicken).  If you're ordering for only yourself, I recommend getting one slice and a salad. Perfect serving size for one!  The one con I'd add is the fact that the food took a really long time. We were in a bit of time crunch for our next game, so we were a little anxious for our food. Possibly, it may have also been because of our initial hunger and tiredness that made the 30minute wait drag on even longer. Plus, our group was big, so there's more understanding. However, I noticed on other reviews that their experience featured a long wait time as well...  Other than that, the place was great, especially for a large party. The others ordered a half sheet pizza, which filled them up. The waitress handled the multiple receipts perfectly, so you won't have to stress about dividing and managing money within the group if you do come in a big group!",

    "text": "Came here with a group of friends last night. All of us but 1 have never been here so we were all excited to try out this place our friend was raving about. Parking is scarce, so it was a good thing most of us carpooled. The restaurant isn't really big, but was big enough to have 2 parties of 10 and a couple of extra tables for other guests.   Being a fan of the Food Network shows, I was pleased to find that Dining, Drive-Ins & Dives was here....so naturally, I ordered what Guy ordered.   Suicide Fries:  Fries smothered in a hot pepper blend and habanero-garlic sauce. Topped with sliced jalapenos and yellow peppercinni.     I wasn't too thrilled with it because the fries were wet and soggy. I have to note that the sauce they used was the same sauce they used on their 'suicide' hot wings. The sauce had a nice heat and kick to it, with a nice, smoky flavor.  Guinea Pie Pizza: Grandma's meatballs, spinach, ricotta, white garlic sauce and mozzarella.    I ordered the smallest one they had, the 1/4 sheet. Man! It's HUGE! I swear it can feed a whole family! I had about one slice which was really good. The dough is homemade and I was told that the chef grows his own herbs, which is a big plus!   Why 3 Stars?  1. The fries were soggy. Not because it was smothered in the sauce, but because the fries wasn't crunchy to start with. 2. The wait for a table. It was a long ass wait. 3. The restaurant was dimly lighted. The guy standing in the front, behind the register, didn't even have lights to see. It wasn't until we were about to leave(11:30pm) that someone figured out that they should turn on some lights for the restaurant!",

Service was friendly and quick, pizza was pretty good, and not very expensive (which was a nice change of pace). Very accommodating to sports fans and college kids, although definitely appeared to be family friendly as well.",

    "text": "GOD BLESS BUFFALO, NEW YORK!!   Ok, maybe I'm biased but I think my hometown has some of the best food in the nation. Having wandered west I have struggled through some pretty horrific culinary wastelands. Still trying to get over the horrible food in Colorado where people think Olive Garden is good Italian (insert hard eye roll here).  Vegas, no doubt, has great food but Naked City just became a weekly spot for me.   I came in just off good reviews. Looked at the wall - Buffalo Sabres, Buffalo Bills pics...hmm interesting.  Looked at the counter - Weber's mustard...hmm.  Next to the mustard, Chiavetta's marinade...hmm.  Sahlen's hot dogs? Ok what's going on here? It was like a Buffalo parade of foodie happiness. I ordered the suicide fries (yes not for the faint of heart), 10 hot wings and a half sheet of Naked City pizza! I figured I wanted leftovers!  After eating, I demanded to see the owner. Yes, he was from Buffalo. I hugged him like he was a long lost brother.   AMERICA, PLEASE, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD AND ALL THINGS HOLY - stop asking for ranch with your wings. It's blue cheese. It's always been blue cheese. You wouldn't have a peanut butter and mayonnaise sandwich would you? Don't ask for ranch - it's embarrassing - you should know better. It's wings with blue cheese just like it's peanut butter and jelly. Come correct and don't embarrass yourself. Thank you. That is all.",

    "text": "Naked City Pizza is a really good pizza and wings joint.   It's tucked away in an unassuming building about a block away from the Hard Rock casino.   The pizza you'll get at Naked City is a thicker pie that's somewhere between Chicago and New York style pizza with a nice heavy layer of mozzarella cheese that I believe they make in house.   You can choose between red and white sauce on your pizza.   In addition to the regular menu they often have special limited time items. Like corned beef on St Patty's day for example.   They do a good job of posting the special menu items on their Facebook page if you're interested.",

    "text": "As a Buffalo native, I really wanted to like Naked City. After having been disappointed by the El Cortez location, we gave this location a whirl. We ordered a Pizza sub that was the star of the meal with a rating of \"good\".  An order of 6 chicken fingers was turned into about 20 small scraps of chicken. They were mushy and chewy, and seemed to be very low quality chicken. For a sauce advertised as \"Chargrilled BBQ\" there was definitely no grill involved. The sauce was similar to a Chinese restaurant and not at all what I'd expect any BBQ sauce to be. They asked at the counter if we wanted ranch or blue cheese, and then gave us the wrong one (ranch isn't even an option in a real Buffalo pizza place).  The poutine fries were soggy and bland. The seasoning they use on the fries is a bit overpowering and doesn't do them any favor. If you're going to steal the poutine name for your dish, at least make something good. Mozzarella doesn't have the flavor profile that cheese curds do, which leads to this just being a salty wet mess.",

Only issue I had was it made me fat! But what else do you expect if you eat it as often as I did??  Well now I moved to Cali, lost 25 lbs.. but still miss it! Yum!

I suggest you get servers who actually care about tending to the customers in actually keeping the place clean.",

It takes awhile to get it, but it's worth the wait. Like I said about the moon doggie location. Very surprising how crispy the crust is even though the crust is thick.

This place definitely was punching above it's off-strip location, and I'd absolutely eat here again next time I'm in town.",

    "text": "I'm a bit of a pizza snob, so I tend to order through places like Rosati's and the higher rated small stores. If I have to order from a franchise, I do Pizza Hut. I think the founder of Papa Johns is a d-bag, and Dominos is just flat out awful. That's my TMI on pizza preferences.   I saw Naked City on Postmates, and thought I'd give it a try. I'm happy I did. Their pizza has an extra thick layer of cheese, which I liked, but the sauce was a bit sweeter than I think it needed to be. the sausage was quite good and didn't have that artificial level of spice that some add.   We ordered the big pizza, which is huge. We also ordered a bad of zeppoles, which were pretty good too. They come with a small container of chocolate. (If you like chocolate, ask for and extra container, the one didn't do it for the who bag).  Overall it was a pretty good dinner, and we all agreed it was far above any of the big name pizza guys, but not quite Rosatis. But I should mention the price is pretty decent for the amount you get with the big pizza.",

    "text": "Based on the food that I got, this place is amazing.  Before coming here, I didn't know that this place made Buffalo-style pizza and to be honest, I didn't know what Buffalo-style pizza was.  Since going, I have been educated on the definition.  Buffalo-style pizza:  (Noun):  Freaking delicious pizza!  Don't believe me, look it up in the dictionary or come here and try it for yourself.  While you're at it, get a side of buffalo wings as well as they are also out of this world.  Opt for the hot sauce as I found it has a similar heat level to medium and most other places.  I hate to use the phrase \"finger-licking good\" because it makes you think of a certain terrible chain restaurant but you will be sticking your whole hand in your mouth after eating these wings and their awesome ranch.  Back to the pizza though, just get it.  It comes in big square slices, each supa thick and filling.  The waitress told me I would never finish six slices and let me tell you, I didn't but that's only because I wanted some for lunch the next day.  I could've easily eaten it all because it was so good and because, you know, I can eat a ton.  Location is a bit ehh, and pretty small.  Service takes a bit longer than some other places but as I've said in a lot of other reviews, I will wait for and pay more for good food.  Dang, now I'm craving it and need to go back.",

This location is perfect for take out orders due to the convenient location if you're leaving the strip but they have a small restaurant too. For two people, we order a 1/4 sheet and it gives you six slices. I recommend getting a side of ranch because they have the best ranch!! We always order the garlic rolls/knots. They look like little cinnamon rolls but they are kinda like garlic knots, with marinara sauce. I've noticed that the garlic knots are a little better at this location than the one on Eastern. For the pizza, I recommend asking for the cheese a little well done...it makes a huge difference.   I've always had great service here. Super fast and attentive!",

The pizza that placed this joint on the map.   Both pizzas were amazing. They were a meal and extremely satisfying.    The toppings on the veggie pizza were cooked. Overall great blend   The DDD meatball pizza had a rich white garlicky sauce.   Portions are big. Delicious left overs later when I got home.   I can't wait to go back .",

    "text": "7 adults and 3 kids gathered here recently and we shared a number of dishes.  Once again, Naked City gave us great food from starter Happy Plate to cannoli dessert.  We started with the Happy Plate which was a combination of vegetables, two cheeses, and olives served with some crostini.  Then came the pizza doughnuts which are not on the menu yet.  It's a combination of two cheeses and some pepperoni wrapped in a dough and deep fried and served with marinara.  You could pig out just on these.  Then came three Naked City subs--a pizza sub, a Matty P sub (a more traditional salami, ham, cheese sub), and a ham slaw sub which was the winner hands down.  The ham salad in the sub was wonderful.  This was a winner with the whole group.  We also got a bowl of hand cut fries with the sandwiches.  Next came the pastas.  There was penne a la vodka (the favorite by far), a creamy mushroom Alfredo, cappellini served with Naked City marinara, and the last was Naked City Sunday gravy served with house marinara stewed with beef and sausage.  To accompany the pastas, there were two large chicken parmesan breasts.  To cap off the experience and for the kids of all ages, we got the Buffalo pizza 22 with white garlic sauce, sausage, pepperoni, crispy garlic, hot honey, and mozzarella.  This pizza divided the group. I was taken aback when I got to the hot honey on the pizza.  It was supposed to be hot from red pepper flakes but I tasted sweet honey and although I liked the pizza, this flavor doesn't say pizza to me. I guess I'm too set in my ways.  If this weren't enough, we got a plate of cannoli for dessert.  Service was great and we left stuffed from a lot of good Italian food.  Naked City doesn't disappoint!",

My latest venture had a bit of a twist that was a little disappointing though. I went to Naked City's website and saw that they had an amazing offer, buy a $25 gift certificate get a $25 gift certificate free. Outstanding, right? Well I needed these stat! I reached out to the store and they said that the only way to purchase them was online and that they would be mailed out. That didn't work for me. So I then reached out to see if I could pay for them online, then come in person to pick them up. The response I received stated that the sale had actually ended 2 days earlier (this is after I had already had a phone conversation the previous day) and that it should have been pulled off the website. Long story short, I wasn't able to take advantage of the sale.  Despite the frustration I went ahead and utilized Naked City Pizza for my teams holiday gathering. A few pizzas, some salads, and we even tried the Suicide Fries which were outstanding. Guinea pie was a crowd favorite. Tried the Back Home Pie for the first time and it was really, really good. Both the Chop Salad and Naked Salad were gone before I was able to try any, so they must have been good!   Even though there was a slight snafu, I'm still a huge fan and will be back many times!",

I told her 9 and she immediately responded with \"No. we don't have a table for 9.\"  I answered, \"Ok. Could we have a table for 4 and another table for 5?\" She responded with \"no! That would use up all the remaining seats and then other customers couldn't be seated\". We just stared at the woman with disbelief! What the hell?!

    "text": "Naked City Pizza on Paradise.. Sheesh.. Where do I start?! So I have been meaning to try this place out for quite sometime now and finally had the chance to do so when some friends came into town. Now this location is pretty much walking distance from the Hyatt Place hotel which was where my friends were staying.   The night that we decided to give this place a shot there was pretty much no service whatsoever and what I mean by that is exactly what it sounds like.. No customer service... We called no lie about 4 times with no answer to the phone for a to-go order and finally maybe after the 5th attempt a woman answers the phone just to only place us BACK on hold.. If it wasn't for my friend being so adamant about wanting to have pizza from here I would've said screw it and went to one of the MANY pizza places in the area. The woman who came back on the phone was rather short and a bit rude because we had many questions about the menu. Oh and speaking of the menu the menu that they usually offer online wasn't able to be viewed because the website was down. SO yeah we of course would expect for some patience while we are trying to order food and give this business our money.   One of the most rudest things a business can do is treat a potential customer with disrespect when trying to spend money at their establishment. Fast forward we ended up ordering the pizza, quoted the price as well as 30 minutes until the order would be ready. After arriving close to the time of what was told, while entering there was nobody at the front counter. A dim.. quiet place and after some minutes somebody finally came to the front who was the woman I assume was taking the orders. Told her my name and was then told the pizza still wasn't ready?.. How? It's a ghost town in here and furthermore you guys weren't doing anything but chatting back there..  Bottom Line.. Pizza was delicious but the customer service definitely left a bad taste in my mouth. Rule of thumb for me is I don't care how good the food is, if I'm not treated or welcomed warmly then I will never spend another DIME at your place of business. Period.",

Sure, many can put out a great pie...even \"bad\" pizza is usually edible (with a beer or two lol). But what separates NCP is their attention to flavor profiles and details in their pasta, subs, and sides...giving as much love and passion throughout the menu as their pizza choices.  Give these a try :  Buffalo 22 Pizza Half-Sheet : White Garlic Sauce, Pepperoni, Sausage, Crispy Garlic, Mike's Hot Honey & Mozzarella Cheese. WOW, outstanding pie! So much going on in each bite...the spicy honey a love or hate surprise...seconds please!!  Chicken Parm : Brined Chicken, Breadcrumbs, Mozzarella, Ricotta & Parmesan. Great rendition, thick, juicy chicken with a nice layer of cheese and crunch from the breading. A usual menu skip for me...this one is awesome!  Ham Slaw Sub : \"the best Ham Salad you ever tasted.\" The surprisingly awesome Ham Slaw Sub...slaw resembling an improved version of the Capistrami slaw, not an easy feat!! I will be back to order JUST the sub, pizza not required (but recommended lol)!!  With multiple locations across the valley, each putting out an individually great product, you'll fare well and leave happy and satisfied ;)",

    "text": "When Chris Palmeri announced a whole new menu at Naked City Pizza on Paradise it was only a matter of time before a visit was planned, Saturday's pre-concert meal proving a perfect opportunity to gather seven adults plus three children and taste eleven new items including one still in progress plus a couple old favorites.  Still working hard across multiple venues, Christopher stopping by briefly during a typically busy day but otherwise leaving dinner in the capable hands of Robert Chaney, it was with several tables pushed together along the near wall that diners sat with Soft Drinks in hand, Sinatra crooning overhead as the \"Happy Plate\" arrived featuring housemade Pickles plus Olives and two styles of Cheese, all of it quite good but a \"best bite\" a Floret of Cauliflower on toasted Bread with a smear of Chevre tinged in Honey.   Going for the gusto next with the aforementioned work-in-progress, an ever-creative Chef planning new catering options with \"Pizza Doughnuts\" featuring Cheese and Pepperoni at the center of a crispy Fritter, suffice it to say that the table's self-designated \"picky kid\" devoured two despite poo-pooing several other items without even a taste, the Pizza Sub that is essentially a toaster-style French Bread Pizza converted into a Sandwich also making a good impression.   Enjoying a big bowl of Fries along with two additional sliced Sandwiches, the Matty P stacked thick with Cold Cuts plus Vegetables slicked in housemade Vinaigrette and Ham Slaw living up to its billing as \"the best Ham Salad you ever tasted,\" it was next that four new Pastas would arrive, the Cappellini and Sunday Gravy both offering extra-thin Noodles topped in Sauce though only Vegetarians or those on a diet should select the former over that which is upgraded by slowly simmered Beef and Sausage.   Hearing others state the Mushroom Alfredo was a bit \"bland,\" a lack of overwhelming Salt in comparison to many not unwelcomed by those who appreciate the flavor of Mushrooms, it was nonetheless that all present felt Naked City's Penne a la Vodka was the best dish of the night with Pasta still featuring some tooth tossed in Sauce that balances Herbs, Meat and Tomatoes elegantly.   Never one to exit any Naked City location without Pizza, a Midwestern childhood built on thicker Crusts making Palmeri's Pies as reminiscent as they are delicious, it was eschewing the Back Home or Guinea in favor of one dubbed \"Buffalo 22\" that the crew got their fix, some not loving the Hot Honey as much as others but those who did grabbing extra slices before polishing off a sizable portion of Chicken Parm for just $14 and wrapping things up with Sin City's best Cannolis.  FIVE STARS: Always taking chances and usually coming up a winner Naked City Pizza remains a quintessential part of Las Vegas' dining regardless of location, though the place on Paradise remains the most well appointed with the recent menu changes adding yet another reason to visit.",

    "text": "It's not often that I would give a restaurant with great food bad reviews. However, Naked City Pizza's service (at this particular location) is so abysmal that it warrants a three star reduction in its rating.   I would chalk this up to mediocre employees if I was a betting man. Don't bother calling to place an order if you are within an hour of their closing time. I called four times today 45 minutes before close and they let the phone go to voicemail each time.   On other occasions I have placed orders and arrived to pick up my food which has been made incorrectly. One such instance was as follows; instead of calling to inform me they were out of a topping they decided to sub it for extra cheese. Wasting your customer's time instead of calling back is never a wise choice.   If you are dining in prepare to wait double the normal wait time for anything (and I mean anything). My record was 15 minutes for menus and an hour and a half for food.   When the food is right it is incredible. This is the only redeeming factor which is marred by the inconsistency of the food. Half of the time you will be able to find something wrong with your food.   Better training for your employees is all this location needs to improve. Standards in the kitchen for consistent food, employees conquering their fears of the phone, and better table service would take this location to the level of the others.",

But other than that great food, and the lady is always nice and treats customers very professionally and courteous.   Make sure to call up or look at their social network accounts to find their later-in-the-day specials that don't make it to their regular menus. Really affordable for the items they offer.",

I stopped for a couple of pepperoni slices and beer... waited approx 30 minutes for my slices, not to bad especially if its fresh. My slices looked like they took 2 old plain cheese slices that had been sitting around, threw new cheese on it and placed pepperoni on it to create my pepperoni slices!! And it wasn't even heated up all the way... cheese was slightly melted but not golden like most fresh pizzas are, pepperoni was cupped but definitely not cooked or charred like a fresh pizza .. and one of the slices looked like they put half cup n char, half Hormel pepperoni on it cause they were larger in size, thinner, and flat compared to the regular cup n char they use!! Only reason i ate it was because i was starving and the wait was 1 1/2 - 2 hours and i didnt want to wait. A family walked in and ordered a pizza, took them 2 hours to get their pizza and their kids sat in their car that long waiting for it. The bartender gave them their money back out of his own tip money because he thought it was ridiculous for the wait also!! The Cashier told the family they only had 1 cook and they get overwhelmed during the UNLV Home basketball games for carry out. If they know this, they should hire more people... this is unacceptable by all standards!!",

There are no lemons for the water( they ran out) Our loaded fries were served cold and the cheese not melted. Our group of 6 all eat a forkful or two and brought it to our waitress' attention and then we were told that the chef would make us another order but would have to charge us for a small because we ate some. Really?!? We ordered 2 chopped salads and they ran out of spinach ....hmmmmm so this non-busy restaurant is  not prepared for service and is not willing to serve quality food to their paying guests.  I guess I will have to find another pizza establishment to patronize. Get it together....",

We ordered various things like the crazy Ham slaw sandwich and a \"wee\" order of fries, Poutine, The Naked Salad, Beef on Wek sub, House-Made Italian Sausage Sub, Stuffed banana peppers, Margarita pizza, Guinea's Pie, Paesano Pizza, Back Home Pie, & a couple of other items I didn't get the names of. It was all great food. Their \"wee\" pizzas are not so wee. Definitely enough for a couple of meals if not 3. I cannot wait to go back here & I was looking for my yelp review & couldn't find it hence to the writing of it now. Better late than never.",

The staff is friendly, with server Shauna being knowledgeable, courteous and caring.   Let's talk food. The foundation for every great pizza is crust and sauce. NCP does it right! This crust is not thin but not too thick. It is baked to perfection, having a crunchy bottom and chewy, delicious center. The sauce is genuine, freshly made and absolutely amazing.    Being a pizza connoisseur for thirty-plus years, I have consumed more pizza than the average consumer, I must confess \"The Rebel\" pizza is definitely in my top three of all time. It is incredibly delicious!   Should you wish to begin your visit with a fantastic appetizer, I highly recommend the \"Meatball Skillet.\" Phenomenal meatballs and that amazing sauce!   If you appreciate authentic, excellent Italian fare you owe it to yourself, give this place a visit and enjoy!",

I went in around 4:30 to grab an early dinner and watch some March Madness tournament games! The waitress / front end employee directed me to sit where I wanted, there were only two people there besides me! I took a seat and within a minute or so I had some ice water! I decided on the garlic fries and the Guineas pizza! Both were excellent! The crust on the pie was so perfect ! By the time my food arrived at my table the place had pretty much filled up, with just the one gal working the entire seating area as well as handling take out and phone orders, she was outstanding and I give her a 10 stars out of five! Sadly the wilburs from arizona slimed their way past Xavier in the basketball game, but even that despicable and heartbreaking event didn't ruin my experience! Great food and EXCELLENT service tonight at this location! I recommend everything but uofa sports! FYI this place is right on the corner of Paradise and Naples, it can be a bit tricky to find because Paradise becomes one way at this point and the sign is hard to see while merging, but well worth the possible U-turn you will probably have to make!",

The new cook screwed up my sandwich twice. I always order the Sal Italian sausage with mozzarella and hot and sweet peppers. Well I got a royal when I returned it the brought out a new sandwich wrong it was the same sandwich minus the lettuce and tomatoes but he left the coppicola  and  a bit of lettuce. So he was to lazy to make a new sandwich on top of that it took him 20 minutes to make it with only 3 other people there. So needless to say I will never step back in this location again, I will if I see Chris' truck that way I'll have my food made properly. Normally 5 stars but as long as the have the current cook zero stars. And I've eaten here 100 plus times, so a loyal customer no more.",

    "text": "Stopped in for a bite to eat with a work associate as we were out in LV at a conference. Coming from the east coast, I am picky about the Pizza I eat. I have to say that I was VERY impressed with the quality of the food at this establishment. Had the Hot Sicillian Wings, the seasoned fries, the \"Naked City Pizza\" pie and finished my meal off with some Zeppoles. The meal broke down as follows:  Hot Sicillian wings - These were delicious. A different taste than normal as they are made with parmesean cheese and what appears to be orange, but I have to say that the taste was very enjoyable. I would certainly order them again. From a heat perspective, they were not hot for me, but I have a rather high tolerance for heat.   Seasoned Fries - OMG, these were probably some of the BEST fries I have had. Each fry was crispy on the outside, yet soft on the inside. The seasoning on the fries made them instantly addictive. I ordered the small and when they came out, I could swear that our hostess made a mistake and brought a large. Nope, the small is a large in this case.   Naked city pizza pie - A yummy collection of sausage, pepperoni, onions, green olives on top of mounds of cheese and sauce that will have you licking your fingers and wanting another slice. NY style but in a square format if that makes sense. Thin crust and weighed a ton with all the cheese and toppings. Very tasty and filling.   The Zeppoles were tasty. Not quite as I remember them from my days on Long Island though. Each piece was a small rectangular piece of fried dough covered in powdered sugar.  The Zeppoles tasted great and were bite sized. I grew up on round Zeppoles that were equivalent to a ping pong ball sized piece of dough, but these were more bite sized. There were a LOT of them in the bag though, so you certainly get your $$ worth.  Location is a little off the strip, but I was able to walk there from the strip. It's about 2 miles all in all from the MGM but I can honestly say for the $ and for the taste, it was well worth the walk.  Naked City Pizza will most certainly be a stop I visit the next time I come to Vegas.",

I have yet to receive a bad pie but it was bound to happen and it did last night. I can never remember what they call they're sizes so I've always asked for the middle size and it's never been an issue. Got to the store and received the small size 6 pieces. They were about to close and I was charged for the small as well so I didn't make a fuss. Once me and my family started eating we both noticed our fist pieces didn't have any meat. So we kept eating and more than half of the pizza was like that. Usually you can see whole circle pieces of sausage throughout the pizza but this looked as if there was maybe 3 pieces of meat crumbled across the pizza we were lifting the cheese hoping it was under there too it wasn't. I kid you not it was so bad I literally saved any meat I came across from my pizza and added it to my sons slices. Really disappointed... these are the cheapest pizzas. Still give 3 stars because I love the Arville location and this is the only issue I've had with naked city and I'm not sure if the small order is different than the larger ones as far as meat quantity. Will still be a loyal customer",

We also ordered garlic fries that could have been fired a little longer, I could keep going but I won't... I will not be ever returning to this established ever.

After going to the other location and waiting 20 minutes with nobody greeting us we decided to get up & give the other location a try.. The food was awesome, we got pizza, buffalo dip and fries all of it was bomb! Our server was trying her hardest but they could definitely use another server.. Will probably come back to this location but I would probably order it to go next time.",

    "text": "After having awful tasting, overpriced meals on the strip we decided it was time to venture to high reviewed places off the strip.  Naked City Pizza fit the bill and we decided to stop by for dinner.    Parking is a little odd here...don't try to park out front, it just won't work.  We watched two guys make a 323 point turn trying to get in and then back out when they realized it wasn't going to happen.  There is plenty of space available in the back.  As a lover of all foods spicy, the suicide fries instantly stood out.  We decided to do a full order of them and then a quarter sheet Guinea Pie.  We got some drinks as well and waited for our order.  The fries came out first...they were spicy.  I absolutely love all spicy food, but the habanero suicide sauce was almost too much for me to handle.  It was amazing.  I was sweating in places on my face that I didn't know could sweat...like right under my temples...it was crazy.  It took a while, but I built up a decent enough tolerance and was able to enjoy around half of them.  They were way too much for my girlfriend to handle.  These were amazing, anyone who loves really spicy food must try them out.  The pizza was good too!  The meatballs were really tasty, the cheese all tasted great, and the white garlic sauce tied it all together really nicely.  The quarter sheet was the perfect size for two, and we could have easily fed a third between the fries and the quarter sheet...this was a welcome change from the awful prices and small portions we were used to on the strip.  Overall it was a great meal.  Easily one of the best I've had in Las Vegas.  I'll be recommending this place to family and friends for a long time and look forward to coming back myself.",

    "text": "I was hoping for a slice of New York style coming here, but was actually surprisingly pleased by the corner thick piece of pizza I received upon ordering.  I went with a piece of their daily special, a meat-lover's, and a create-your-own with some peppers and mushroom.  The middle of the pizza was average.  It had a nice kick to it, especially once lathering it with pepper.  But overall just a typical slice.  The crust was very good though and I could just eat that for days.  At less than $5 for a full on specialty and less than $ for a basic cheese, this place is a steal.  The slices are huge and preparation time is reasonable.  Couple that with some ncie beers on tap and a $9 pizza and beer deal to boot, and now we're talking.  Glad they opened another location on the west side.",

    "text": "I Want my money back  I got a turkey sub that included the additional cost of cheese. Fine but they put shredded cheddar no American slices. I was offered provolone and motz. I asked for mayo, onion, lettuce, banana pepper. They don't have banana peppers. They DO have \"hot peppers\" so I ordered those. I found them on the menu myself. Canned jalapeno and pepperoncini is what the \"hot peppers\" consisted of. And the cheese was stale!! The shredded cheddar!! If you don't want to make subs then don't put them on the menu!!   I was also watching the waitress have a hard time entering my order into the POS system. She said \"I have to type a paragraph\" I didn't know if she was mad or not. Sorry the sub only comes with bread meat lettuce and tomato. No mayo! No cheese! Nothing else, so yeah people are going to alter their order because wtf kind of sub is that? I'm from buffalo and I seriously don't know how they could sell a sub like this. Also I've worked at Jim's steakout for several years when I was 16-20 and had no problems with using a cash register POS.   back to the nasty sub I got... They didn't cut the sub in half and it was seriously worse than subway. I'm not even eating it. I want to go back in and return it but the girls are busy (6-7 tables, 2 servers, 1 food runner) and I don't want to get yelled at. I waited 22 mins and paid $13 with a pop for this crap and I want my money back. I really don't even think the full sub is 12\" it looks more like 9 or 10.   Pizza at this location is ok but arville overall is much better food wise. I've had a chicken finger sub from the other location and pizza that was good.   One star for the pizza which if I was you I'd order from Arville instead. Good-Luck",

She is so nice and on top of everything. You can tell she's the HBIC!   I ordered the guinea pie 1/4 sheet and loaded potatoe fries. The 1/4 is about the size of two personal pizzas. Sooooo goood!!! I'm not even a big fan of white pizza. I'm more of a plain cheese pizza kind of girl. It was so good!!! I'm still drooling over it. The loaded potato fries are soooo good. You can tell these are fresh home made fries. Not the frozen crap. Covered in cheese, sour cream, real bacon and chives.  The small was huge I don't know how big the large is.    It's funny did take out. I'm sitting here eating this yummy food and crappy Pizza Hut is on tv lol. Eat naked ship the hut! Lol.",

With only four other parties in the restaurant, we waited more than an hour and a quarter for the one pizza we ordered to be brought out.  It was worth it, but I was prepared for it.  We also resorted to helping ourselves to plates and flatware.  Other problems include the downgrading of beer, moving away from a solid collection of craftbeer to a handful of options.  Also a serious downgrading of the menu.  The better sandwiches are now gone.  This isn't the place that rocked us, even given the awkward location, a couple of years ago.  We'll still return, not as eager, and knowing it may be a long wait.  5 star food, 2 star limited menu, 1 star service.",

Guy was here so check out the flavortownusa site as well.   The pie here is money. Besides the crust being thick and cooked well, the toppings are Top Notch.   We had 6 of us. We ordered 3 \"wee\" size pizzas and two orders of \"wee\" size fries. And almost finished everything. The pizza is very filling based on a thick doughy crust.   One girl running all the tables was very good. If it was really busy, service could be really slow. However we did not have any issues. Good craft beer selections. No mainstream beer.   I loved it, enjoyed the unique options and nothing disappointed. Hope I win some money at the Black Jack table tonight.",

It says they're open until 3am, I got there around 11pm, and as I'm ordering, the lady tells me to make sure to get my whole order in, so I don't need to come back, because they'll close after my order... Um, OK. I said if my order would keep them from closing, I didn't have to place it, and she tells me it's fine. So I place my order, pay for it, leave a couple dollars tip, and there's not even a thank you. When I come back to pick up my order 15 mins later, it's not all correct, and rather than correcting it, all I get is a half-assed \"Sorry dude\" and not even a hint of an attempt to make it right. On top of that, the pizza I did receive was hard as bricks, and mostly tasteless.  My wife worked at Chuck E Cheese when she was younger, and commented that even their pizza is better, so do with that what you will.  Overall, this place sucks, and my wife and I will not be returning",

I am so disappointed in everything..  we ordered 1/2 sheet with pepperoni,  bacon and extra cheese.  Total was around 24...  before I paid, I opened up the box and discovered there was no bacon.  I showed it to the cashier and he took it back to show the cook.  I could see the cooks face and he had a look of disgust.  The cashier came back and told us they are out of bacon.. I was like you were going to charge us for it until I looked at the pizza.  The cashier made an adjustment and took off the bacon.  Then we got home to eat.  The damn crust is not cooked it is dougheeyyy  I'm so irritated that I vowed not to return... this is the worst pizza I have ever had in vegas...  this says a lot cause I frequently visit them but not anymore.  To serve raw dough ridiculous.   You should be ashamed !!!",

Walk to the cash register twice inquiring about our pizza and was told \"when you walked on, it was a 45 minute wait, now it's an hour and a half.\" I have a great idea, how about telling people when they walk in there is a ridiculous wait for pizza, we would have walked out.  When it takes and hour and a half to bake a pizza when you have 5 tables... There is serious mismanagement.  Waitress apologizes sarcastically while making every excuse in the book why no pizza.

The wings have a lot of meat on them, which makes it a really good buy.   What really stands out is the pizza. This is premium pizza with generous toppings. I've had the slice of the day which you can't get on the menu. So far I've had taco, chicken finger, chicken parmesan, and a couple of others but they were all excellent. I love love love the slices of the day but I also like the traditionals like pepperoni and sausage. The slices are so big and filling. I had only one type I didn't like, and that's cause I don't like horseradish. I can't remember the name but it wasn't too bad.   The customer service can improve a little, but rarely do I come to Vegas and get great customer service anywhere. They have two locations and this location is much more generous with the toppings so I only come here.   I come here each time I'm in Vegas because I haven't found better wings and pizza!   Tip: Get the Parmesan cheese with your pizza. It's good enough to eat on its own!",

The meatballs and garlic white sauce really make it stand out. We also tried the garlic buns (really good, only $5!) and the meatball skillet. All very good. I know this place was featured on DD&D but aside from that it's pretty good pizza. TONS of beer choices also. What more could you ask for in a pizza joint? :)",

Tell me, why does the pepperoni curl up around the edges as if it's shrinking?!!?  Also, all the pepperoni fell right off the pizza when it was tilted or just turned upside down (really?).  Maybe it was a bad night, the pizza sure was (bad, that is).",

    "text": "Naked city had a quiet opening, snuggled next to the hofbrauhaus across from the hard rock casino. This area has been joe's pizza territory for a while. Well move on over joe's!   Having been to naked city well over a handful of time since they opened, I've taken a break from joes and do not look to return. Food is the name of the game and naked city pizza plays it well. The menu features a range of items you'd expect from pizza places these days. Pizza, wings, pasta, burgers. How do you take something done a million times and still make it worth it to eat? You make it better, and that's simply what nc does. I can't speak for their plain or pepperoni pizza, which I'm sure is excellent. Naked city shines with its multiple specialty pizza, ranging from a great steak and cheese pizza with white garlic sauce, to meatball pizza and various other combinations. The pizza is freshly made in a timely manner and comes out with great flavors. No one part of a pizza there is better than the other, you'll find yourself enjoying every bite you take.   Away from the pizza norms, nc has an excellent choice for wing lovers. Try the hot sicilian if you want a spicy kick with some excellent flavors! And if you really want some heat, check out the blazing suicide fries! Among the menu is also the ma burger, a heaping size of a burger that skips no shortcuts in the delicious category. And if you need a getaway to a land sweet and savory, grab yourself a cannoli for dessert. You'll thank me later!  Naked city is still settling in, but has been nothing short of great. Check it out and I'm sure you'll enjoy!",

    "text": "Unfortunately I don't get to review the pizza. Walked into naked city at 4:30pm on a Monday. Ordered two slices of cheese and was told it'd be five minutes. Sat down, 25 minutes later walked to the counter and asked where the slices were. I was told that they just put the cheese pizza in the oven and it'd be another ten minutes. I advised the people behind the counter that 35 minutes for two slices of cheese was unacceptable and asked for a refund, which was promptly given and I left.   If a pizza shop sells slices (which not all do, which is fine) then there should always be a pizza on deck. If there isn't, then the workers in front should be aware. Regardless, if it's going to take 35 minutes for two slices of pizza, the customer should be made aware.   It's a shame. This pizza may have been good, but the service and kitchen work prevented me from even trying it. When I'm served bad food, at least I get food.",

Miles above the other local pizza places I've been to in town, and the prices are more than reasonable. We tried the garlic buns, garlic fries, Guinea's Pie, and Naked City Pizza. My favorite out of the 2 pies was the Naked City - it's so yummy with an amazing crust. And the garlic buns?! Do yourself a favor - go ahead and order 2 plates so you don't have to share with whoever you go with. They're so good that they could be a meal by itself. The location is convenient to the Strip, the airport, and UNLV. The service? Quick and fantastic. Don't miss out - you haven't had great pizza into you've been to Naked City Pizza. I'll definitely be back!",

We then ordered some garlic knots. 20 min later they came out in a pool of flavorless marinara sauce. The dough was also flavorless. We then ordered 2 of the smaller pizzas, the Guinea Pie and my friends ordered some arugula pizza with an egg on it. When the waitress brought the arugula/egg pizza out, she started smearing the egg all over it with a fork....and she kept smearing.....and smearing....it was so unappetizing. I took a bite and I'm not even kidding...I thought I was going to gag. It was salty...and tasted like a stink bomb. If you want good pizza, go to Metro or Grimaldis. Hell...I think Dominoes would have been better and that pizza is terrible. My friend decided to take the left overs...I made him put the box in the trunk of my car. When I dropped him off I opened the trunk and I swear I thought Tony Soprano hid a body in there. Ack. Oh! I forgot to add that the waitress brought us the pizza that belonged to the people next to us. When she realized it, my husband was already dishing up a slice and she ran to him, slapped his hand off of it, took it back, and served it to it's rightful owners!! You can't make this up.",

    "text": "Yelp is my go to for recommendations, but this is my first time writing a review. This was hands down THE worst dining experience I have ever had! I know, I know... I should have listened to the others, so I really have no one to blame but myself, but we had an entertainment coupon and it was on DDD, so how bad could it be, right???  The first red flag should have been the guy alone PASSED OUT in the booth. The server said he was waiting for his party to arrive and acted like it was totally normal for someone to be sleeping, with their mouth wide open in a restaurant. Red flag number 2, besides him, there was only one other family in the restaurant, on a Saturday night at 5:45pm. We ordered our food (1 wee,1 not so wee, 1 salad, and 1 sausage sandwich) and then we waited. Red flag number 3, after we placed our order we had to give our dirty, paper menus to the people next to us that had just say down. I guess they didn't have enough to give them? Weird!!! After waiting 45 minutes we were starting to get really hungry and the restaurant was filling up. We asked about how much longer and the sever said any minute, but that they only had two ovens and there were a lot of orders. She laughed about it like it was a joke and when I said this is not funny, we are starving she said \"it's my job to smile\" in her snarkiest voice. This is when I started to lose my patience. My 4 year old was starving, (and at this point had eaten all of the snacks I had in my bag) as were the rest of us. When we ordered our food, we were the only table in the restaurant that had no food! The people next to us were already eating and I am pretty sure the guy passed out was not planning on eating. So why then was it taking 45 minutes to get our food!?!?  Finally 15 minutes later our salad came out, but we had no plates. Then one pizza came out, but not the other. The two other tables that came in after us got their pizzas before we got our second pizza and our sandwich!!! So half my family had no food! The other half couldn't eat anyway because they use so much cheese it took forever to cool off enough to be able to eat it. The service was terrible and my husband had to get up four different times to get napkins, knives, extra plates, and a box. The tables are also ridiculous. Every time one of us had to get up we had to move the table to be able to fit. We are regular sized people, but the tables are like picnic tables at a booth and the wood legs block you in. I have never had to move an entire table to be able to get out of my seat. When we were finally done no surprise the bill was wrong. They had said they would take off the sandwich because they messed it up (shocker) but it was still on the bill. As we got in the car to leave we all breathed a sigh of relief that dinner was over. I guess all you can do is laugh about it and of course \"yelp\" about it. Thanks for reading!",
