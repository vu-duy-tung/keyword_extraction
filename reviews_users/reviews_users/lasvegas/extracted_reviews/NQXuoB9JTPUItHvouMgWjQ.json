I usually order the buffalo \"Sassy Wings\" as an appetizer and the \"Shinto Sandwich\" with mac n' cheese as my side. I've also tried the nachos and \"Violette Club\" sandwich previously and they were delicious as well. Food is priced in the $10-16 range but portion sizes are very generous. They also have a wide variety of desserts. If you're vegan and/or looking for a spot to enjoy with your non-vegan friends, this is the place to go!",

We used a yelp check in to get a free soup du jour and I think it was a zucchini soup. It was rather low on flavor. Basically none.  Both meals, as well as everything in the store, were overpriced. There are other vegan options at better prices that taste just as good so I will rarely return and certainly not with a non-vegan friend. Better prices and/or larger portions would entice me to return. The prices seem highly unlikely to attract non-vegans.",

I came here the other day and got the breakfast sandwich with sausage which is served all day. Other items that I love is the club sandwich and their chili cheese fries. The only downside is everything costs a little more than an average meal, I would say at least $12-15 a meal which could add up quickly. I love how EVERYTHING is vegan which makes it so easy and fun to order. I've been here with people that are not vegan and they seem to love it too, so I wouldn't be afraid to try this place if you aren't necessarily vegan. Its also located in a decent area and I've never had to wait for a table which is always good.",

They didn't prepare the tofu very well.  No flavor whatsoever.  If it weren't for the pesto and avocado in my sandwich I would feel like I was eating cardboard.  The only thing I really enjoyed was the coconut cake.  So good!  It is probably the only thing I would come for again.  The service on the other hand was awesome!! Mike Scott was our server.  He was very kind and attentive.  I was originally going to give this place 3 stars but the impeccable service changed my mind.",

My nachos were missing items that they are usually served with (salsa, vegan sour cream) they were not very tasty. The chips I think made it worse. I did however enjoy my juice (The Beet Goes On) which was freshly made with a lovely flavor. I would try again just to see if I may enjoy some of their other offerings. All in all, I'd definitely go back and try other dishes.",

I am not vegan but I do eat vegan sometimes because I like to on occasion, however I usually only like the vegan food I cook but this place definitely delivers on flavor. I ordered the pad Thai it was good but it had a little too much peanut in it. My friend ordered the Mac and cheeze which was amazing for not having dairy!",

Whether or not you are vegan, this place will not disappoint. Our group equally liked all dishes, and eagerly discussed when we would come back, and tried to convince the owner to move the place, or open another, in our home city.  She also delivers to the Strip, so if you don't want to make the 15-minute drive to her well-appointed, clean restaurant, they will bring their fresh, organic delicious food to you.  Try something new in Vegas, get off the strip with the standard fare, and your taste buds will explode. Even more fun, the owner is a professional poker player, so an interesting connection to Vegas there.",

The 2 desserts from the Vegan Bakery were delicious! The cochise layer cake from Violets was awful! Absolutely disgusting so called cake. We live far or would have brought that yucky cake back!

The food was okay, not too much flavor and pretty pricey. Nothing too exciting, probably wouldn't come back because of the price especially for the small amount of food you get. Also, side note: when my boyfriend and I were leaving the place was closing so one of the workers was mopping the floor. There weren't any wet floor signs and obviously during our meal we weren't inspecting where the worker had and hadn't mopped yet so when we got up to leave, in front of the door was soaking wet and my boyfriend slipped and fell!!! The worker looked up and didn't even ask if my boyfriend was okay or offer any kind of assistance. Crazy because he fell into the glass door and partly onto the floor pretty hard so it's offensive that no one checked to make sure he was okay or anything??",

    "text": "Very excited to see some vegan comfort food making its way to Vegas. For those of you, like me,that visit LA regularly and crave Native Foods and Real Food Daily this is the closest runner up yet to these types of foods. I celebrate this opening happily!  My first visit I tried the REUBEN and potato salad. Flavored were there and the tempeh bacon was delicious. I would recommend improving the bread quality and then I'd give it an A. Also they seem skimpy with the bacon which was the best part.  Also tried the Mac and cheese. Huge portion on the side order and while i loved it, I think it was extremely bland for the normal palette . Maybe needed a bit more nooch? Also crumble up the bread crumbs on top more. Weird as big dry cubes in top. Nice and creamy texture.  Dessert!!!! The choc cake was unreal!! So moist and delicious. A must have. Better than Red Velvet Cafe imo.   Next day I went back for more...... Got the hippy chip burger and a club sand. Probably won't try them again. Nothing special. But that bacon rocks!!  Lots more of menu items to try!!! Including breakfast, finally!!! Oh and the Potato salad in awesome!! Creamy and great crunch from onions and celery.   Cons: Day one I tried to order the nachos and they said they were out of guac. Really? Smiths is in the same shopping center and it was only about 2pm. Buy some avocados! Day 2: ordered a samurai burger to go and was told it was my lucky day because they had one left. When I got there I was told they were wrong. Offered the hippy chick burger instead which was tasteless mush. :( Day 1&2: Disappointed that the menu says choc cake has walnuts and choc chips on it but both times no walnuts. Told that the pic on yelp may have just been for show! Lol. Throw some friggin walnuts on it! The menu says it!",

I walked in & I was waiting at the cash register for 15 min! (While workers were walking pass me) I finally had to speak up and get their attention. So a employee with a very bad attitude decides to finally help me.  I order the samurai burger & the worker has the audacity to tell me \"oh by the way we don't do the whole medium, medium-rare thing here. It's all vegan\" Ummmm...why would she automatically assume that I thought it was a actual hamburger. I felt like that was rude because I mean...in big letters, its say \"vegan restaurant\" on the sign...I'm not stupid & not only that I read the menu.. I've been to other vegan restaurants and they've never made a statement like that.  So I was very irritated by that comment!Plus the vibe in there is so judgmental! So it made it 10x worse.  So it takes about 30 mins for my food to be done & I couldn't have been any more happy to get out of that place.  Ughh rude hipsters literally ruin everything. They just need to stop thinking they're better than everyone.  But yea if you are considering trying this place out, I recommend you have bite squad deliver to your house so you won't have to be belittled while picking up or eating your food! :)",

The portions were excellent. I got the Mama Mia and a side of Mac and cheese. I also got a peanut butter cup \"milk\"shake and had the carrot cake.  My boyfriend had the pad Thai with the house salad. We are both going home very satisfied and I've got leftover Mac and cheese because my eyes are bigger than my stomach.  Great birthday dinner!  10/10  I will be back  Thank you for an amazing dinner.",

The pad Thai was probably my favorite thing I've had here! The sassy (seitan) wings are delicious. The Violette Club is very tasty as well as the California dreaming \"bacon and cheese\" burger. Chili cheese fries because, well how could you not? I've also enjoyed breakfast here. I believe I ordered the southwestern burrito but could be wrong. Whatever it was, it was a delicious wrap. My friends ordered a milkshake here and although the flavor was great, it wasn't very cold. That's the only complaint out of several orders of food. They also have a variety of cold pressed juice but have not tried any yet. The service is always charming!",

I waited quite a while to be served, and my sandwich order took quite a while because another server swiped it off the service counter for another customer.   When the second sandwich arrived, I noticed the fries I had asked for as well done crispy were actually a bit oily and soggy. They tasted about as good as they looked.   Server apologized, and reordered. So again, I wait.   The club sandwich that was recommended to me had a tofu \"chicken layer\" infused with a strange flavor you wouldn't expect in a club sandwich.   Hesitant about returning, below par dining experience for the cost. Would suggest to you to dine somewhere else given an option.",

They have a lot of vegan comfort food options The atmosphere was very appealing too. It was super clean and the waitress was very attentive and friendly. They have outside seating options. We actually sat out there to chat after our meal. I'll definitely be going back!",

We ordered off of the breakfast menu. I ordered chocolate chips pancakes with a side of tofu scramble, potatoes, and a sausage patty. All of it was delicious. The only thing I wasn't a huge fan of was the sausage patty but everything else was yummy in my tummy. The second time I went back, I brought my best friend along. We arrived during lunch hours so I ordered the vegan eggplant parmesan with spaghetti which included a side of broccoli. It was mouth watering. I could eat it again and again.   If you live in Las Vegas or are visiting, I definitely recommend that you stop by and grab a bite. You don't have to be vegan to enjoy the fantastic food at Violet's Vegan. It's hard to believe that all this delicious food is vegan.",

Big menu with delicious food and good prices. I believe breakfast is served on the weekends and lunch/dinner during the week. The \"beef\" and broccoli was full of flavor and a huge portion, I was able to take half of it home for next lunch, I've had pancakes, mac n cheeze and zucchini sticks. So yummmy!

However, I just found that they're expensive!  One of the things that people complain about is how expensive vegan food is and this place is proving it.  I used to go every single week. Until I realized how much it was setting me back! For an average person to go there and get an appetizer, entree and a regular beverage will set you back $30 or more per person. And that's without tip!  I really wanna start coming here weekly again, please Violet, lower the prices a bit so us average income earners can eat here more often!! Otherwise, everything is amazing:)",

I got the Ceasar salad, the beef and broccoli and the Bronson's buffalo wings.  I had the beef and broccoli today for lunch and LOVED it. It was a huge serving (I have enough for another snack or small meal. The Bronsons wings were okay, I just wish there was more buffalo sauce on them (but I love sauce), and the salad was good, but the serving size wasn't that much for the price and the croutons lacked something. Overall I am really glad I tried Violette's and will be back again. I am eager to try some other things on their menu as well.",

    "text": "I have eaten here so many times before. I'm a local vegan in the entertainment industry here in Vegas and I have tried EVERY vegan restaurant in town. Some of my fav places are located in china town and at the lakes but Violettes  menu is full of  comfort food selections. I was super excited when this place opened. I have eaten there over a dozen times and unfortunately have ran into issues with their service and getting orders right.   I've ordered out a few times, one time I ordered  my fav, the red rock nachos. Not a difficult dish to make (if you're into vegan cooking) and you would think that common sense would be to put that type of cheese on the side to avoid the wet soggy nacho chips I was sent home with. I also had order a chocolate milkshake  when she brought it to me it was purely chocolate milk... The waitress explanation to this was, 'well the ice cream melts quickly so our shakes tend to be more vegan milk-like. I've worked in the  restaurant  industry for many years and was appalled by this answer.... She could have just figured it out and fixed it....    I sent my good friend from LA whose a well known actress and public vegan advocate to Violettes. She stopped in and ate breakfast. The breakfast menu is delish and is well thought out when it comes to flavor and portions/price. I recommended pancakes and the sunrise breakfast of course, which has seemed to be a bit on the dry side lately and extra oily veggies but this can be over looked when you're looking for a hearty breakfast fix. They  forgot half her side order of pancakes and when she asked for a refill of coffee TWICE they never brought it... She's an easy going vegan foodie and her dis appointment in my recommendation was embarrassing yet I should have know better from my personal past experiences.   My most recent experience was so overwhelming. My guy friend had ordered 2 orders of chocolate chip walnut pancakes for us (which was an up charge for the chips they said) we also ordered their sunrise breakfast for that hearty fulfillment. The sunrise breakfast had amazing potatoes, the tofu scramble was dry and unflavored once again and the veggies we soggy.  But worst off they forgot the chocolate chips in our pancakes (second time this has happened). I never call to complain especially because I've been giving them the benefit of the doubt of being new. Well they are now no longer new and I decided to let them know what my experiences have been. I called to give them a heads up in hopes it would help them improve their customer service and they apologized and they took down our names and even offered  a comped meal for our next visit.One week later I called back and they had no recollection or name written down. I knew I was speaking to the manager because I've seen her in there several times and she said there was nothing she could do. I said I've spoken to you about these issues before and dont you have the power to make this right?! She said that she couldn't give a comped meal over the $2 chocolate  chip mishap.... I reminded her that that's not the point and declined entertaining the idea of receiving anything from them. I told her after 8 months of continually trying their restaurant out that I no longer will be a costumer of theirs....   I'll take my vegan waffles with fantastic customer service and people who care from Tiabi Waffle House and send  my hippie LA coworkers/friends to Go Raw Cafe down the street where I've been going for several years now and never ONE issue!!! Not to mention the owner is a doll and extremely accommodating. Sorry for the rant yelp friends, again not usually my style of reviewing but I'm tired of feeling taken advantage of by Vegan Violettes and their owner.",

During the hour we waited these tables were not cleaned and we saw new customers have to sit at the dirty tables. Eventually we got menus and ordered.  We cringed at the noise decibel and the juicer on the counter was  horrible.  Made me very uncomfortable.  But it was my birthday and we waited patiently...until we saw several that came in AFTER us, ORDERED AFTER us get SERVED BEFORE us!! Their orders were not called in, they ordered from their table just like we did..after waiting for over an HOUR, we left!!  HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO ME!! I honestly do not think we will be back.

I liked the neo-hippie staff and the friendly vibe.  Live music.  I had the veggie club and ate part of my fiance's hippie chick burger.  Best veggie selection of dishes in town.

I had to get up to get a menu and they still didn't acknowledge us. Finally I had enough and went up the waiter and asked if we were ever getting help because they sure ran up to the elderly couple that just came in. When she came up to take our food order she gave horrible attitude and rushed us. So I don't know if it's because we are women of color? I really hope that's not the case because then I will have a more formal complaint on the way. It needs to get addressed because that's extremely poor customer service.",

He was a customer turned server and was thoughtful with our items when packaging and who doesn't appreciate their food handled with care. There is so much on the menu that I know I'll be back soon to try something else. Parking is easy and the bathrooms are clean. And the music is always chill and kick back here.

This time, we must have shown up a little later than usual because it was quiet. The special was CBD coffee, I'd been wanting to try that since moving to Cali two years ago but hadn't. I asked our super sweet waitress how it felt and she explained it perfectly. We got two cups of the coffee and the club sandwich. The coffee was so good. Warming, comforting, awakening and delicious. The club sandwich was actually sooo good, too. The pesto tasted fresh, the veggies were crispy and it was good to the very last bite. This will forever be our breakfast, lunch and dinner spot in Las Vegas!",

And the nachos unfortunately had raw onions all over them which we don't like, so that was annoying because it didn't say so on the menu. My quinoa salad was pretty good too, it had lots of fresh veggies and was big enough that I took at least half of it home to eat later. The fried chicken was also very good, it definitely tasted like comfort food. And finally the date me smoothie was sweet and creamy and perfect for dessert. The ambiance here is vibrant and fun.

    "text": "Update for earlier review:    They have since changed the El Toro Grande Burrito entree.  The meal traditionally includes a fairly sized burrito, corn chips, grilled veggies, guacamole, and salsa.   This is for the whopping price of $15!  Now, they cut the veggies and substituted them with lettuce.  Literally pieces of lettuce. In addition, they removed the guacamole and and salsa. But the funny thing is they didn't lower the price at all.  And the menu didn't display any of these changes.  I think they instituted these changes to save money and inventory, but it was a poor choice.    P.S. Make the cauliflower bites larger or add more!  Veggie Grill in California gives you huge cauliflower bites for a dollar less!  We love your food but sometimes the portions are small for the price.  Much love",

    "text": "I had been really excited about trying the food here for the last couple of years, and while working from home I had no chance. Now that I work near Summerlin, I can drive here on my way home. I tried the Hippie Chick Burger, the quesadilla and carrot cake, plus an Alkaliner, a smoothie with carrot juice, ginger and coconut water.  While it was a tad after lunch hour, it was still pretty busy and the staff seemed pretty overwhelmed, because the smoothie bar was slow to provide my order and I waited for 23 minutes for the food.  The Hippie Chick Burger has a nice texture, but the bun is unremarkable and burger is bland, being far surpassed by the much more reasonably priced black bean burger at Freddy's Custard, which has great seasoning. I did really like the seasoning on the quesadilla and my side order of potato salad. Carrot cake was just ok and maybe this is why they have to rave about it when you order. The alkaliner smoothie was nothing to write home about, except for the splash of cayenne in the watery carrot juice. I was not overly thrilled with the customer service but this could have been the busy hour.  The person at the cash register gushed about the carrot cake, and sure was quick to do a little up-sell to get me thinking about a smoothie (and I heard her do the same to others).  If I state an order, as an adult of advanced age, I know exactly what I have chosen, but I was feeling generous and agreed to the Alkaliner.  When you enter, you can only see the list of drinks on the boards. I asked for a menu and a young woman at the register told me the menu is all online. It took a few minutes to have our discussion evolve with this rather clueless young person to her actually handing me a menu to review.  I much prefer to have more eye contact and a welcoming feeling, whereas it seemed to be the customer who should show gratitude for being here... Hmmm I found a weird vibe in general.  This cafe does not compare, in my opinion, to the other V restaurant which is so popular and which makes you feel genuinely appreciated in the downtown and Henderson locations.  I acknowledge that my high expectations were dashed. I really went in wanting to like the experience, but after years of my having taught and having provided superior customer service, I am disappointed.  I  would probably try going back, to give Violette's the chance to spruce up their customer care, but I am not racing back...just yet.",

When I called to speak to management about the Incident,  I spoke to a very unprofessional lady named Careen who claimed to be front of the house manager. While trying to explain what my husband had experienced earlier while trying to purchase a gift certificate, she rudely starts talking to a server about another customer and his credit card. I'm now upset and ask for the name of a manager that I can speak to. She constantly continued to speak over me to the point where I had to hang up and call back. When I called back Nuki answered and I heard Careen say to her \" if it's that same bitch hang up\" I definitely DO NOT recommend this place to anyone.  I will be contacting David Church in the morning. It was a whole other ordeal trying to get his name out of the both of them. We are very disappointed at the behaviour from this establishment.  I will be in to return the gift certificate, and I will not send anyone here again, nor will we be returning. They still dont know what I was calling for to begin with. Such horrendous customer service. I was able to leave the owner Cyndy a message on messenger, hopefully she will reach out to us. There are many Vegan restaurants opening in the valley. I highly suggest staying away from Violettes Vegan until they restaff, or retrain the current employees.",

    "text": "I just want to start off my saying I love Violette's! What made me want to write this review though, is the last visit I made here with a friend. At one point my friends and I would make a trip here almost every week, we were obsessed! Not only with the food, but also the overall environment and feel of the place was welcoming and nice. Lately we hadn't been able to go until just recently, and we were really excited to finally eat here again. It is a little far from where we live so we usually go early in the day, but this particular night we couldn't go early. I don't like going to places near their closing time because it makes me feel bad, but we arrived at 9 pm, an hour before closing. This is where our disappointment comes in. Employees behind the juice bar exclaimed very loudly and in a rude tone (probably so that we could hear) \"why are people coming in right now don't they know we're closing soon why would you do that\" and glared our way (and at two other people who also came in at the same time as us). He also said some other things I can't really remember but the tone was just really nasty, it made my friend and I feel really bad and unwelcome which was disappointing. I get that having people come close to closing is annoying but it was still an hour away, and I wouldn't purposely say that kind of thing outloud purposely for the customers to hear. Fortunately, our waitress was really nice (Frequently has a ponytail, haven't caught her name :/, but she is really nice every time we've gotten her) and that put us at ease for a bit. We ordered our food to go and left as soon as possible, we didn't wanna be there anymore. Although my good experiences here outweigh the bad, that experience really left a mark on us because we'd never felt so unwelcome there before. I'm not sure I will return (I most likely will, the food is awesome) but i'll make sure to go earlier in the day and probably order to go again.   Update: I have decided to update my review, because the owner, Violette, has contacted me and was really nice and apologetic about the incident. Despite this experience, I really do enjoy going to Violette's and will be back. I appreciate the owner's concern and how nice she is, which does make up for what happened in my opinion! ^_^",

I have since been messaged not once but twice by management and ownership to remove my pictures (and the review was hinted at, too) because the dishes \"are no longer on our menu.\" I spoke to another Yelper who said she'd also been contacted about removing photos of an order that was visually unappealing. Don't let it come out of your kitchen if you aren't proud of it!  It's been quite some time since my last visit, and I've incorporated more meatless meals into my diet- so I came back for the amazing-looking Nature Girl salad. You'll notice my photo looks nothing like others posted, and I'm not taking it down. That's what I was served.   I called in my order and was told it'd be ready in about 10 minutes. I showed up in 15, and then waited an extra 5 for it to be ready. From the looks of it, they waited until I showed up to assemble it. There were no sprouts or tempeh bacon, and the dressing was flavorless. I realize presentation isn't going to be on par when you opt for takeout, but this was a half-assed salad. I enjoyed the herbed tofu and the plethora of nuts, but was extremely disappointed with the salad I received versus what others have had.  I wonder how many other people received less-than-perfect orders, posted photos, and were then asked to remove them.",

Lucky I live near otherwise I doubt I would have heard about it so soon. The owners appeared to be there and giving directions to new employees which was great to see. The only downfall was an extensive wait time. It took more than 45 minutes before we had the food we ordered. This is understandable as they are new and probably still doing training. Hope it's slightly faster next time but will def be back soon!",

    "text": "First of all, I just want to say I am a Vegan of almost 2 years now in my 10 years of living in Las Vegas and this is the BEST VEGAN RESTAURANT here! I LOVE their selections and varieties for breakfast, lunch, and dinner! The biscuits and gravy are delicious! I also had the watermelon lemonade that was very refreshing. But the Sunrise Superman was to die for. You gotta try this!   What didn't quite make sense to me was that they sell their used books for the same price they are priced originally for. For me, this doesn't make sense because 1. They're used. 2. I can get a BRAND NEW one for the same exact price at Barns and Noble. I even picked a few up to look at them and there was marker in many of the pages in one in particular. Half price definitely seems more reasonable. The wait for our food is one other minor disappointment. My Parents and I came here around 10am. There was only one other table at that time and maybe 1 guy at the bar, but by 10:45/11am it was pretty busy for just one waitress, like I mentioned, we got there around 10am but we didn't leave until 12pm because of the wait for our food. Our waitress however did do a great job and juggling everything being the only person out there. She actually engaged with us and advised us of what's popular, as well as her favorites. She also came to apologize about the hold time. This means a lot to me because I've been many places were people don't apologize or show empathy to the unforeseen lack of service. I appreciated that and her upbeat personality throughout our visit. There was never an \"idk\" answer. I  will be coming back for lunch next! :)   Thank you for contributing to the greater good! Becoming vegan is one of most valued, and best accomplishment. We are contributing to the betterment of the world. And I will always support people/organizations that are apart of that. Thank you again! See you soon.",

    "text": "I really wanted to love this place. I can justify to myself giving the 3 stars since for the most part the food was good -The bean & corn salad on the side was very good.  I appreciate that they hand make the gluten-free wrap for their teriyaki wrap but it was a little soggy from the sauce in the wrap so we had to use a knife and fork to eat the wrap. Plus I think the tortilla could have been cooked a bit more since it was quite thick & very doughy in the center This may have been because it was still early when I ordered it at 11:20 and their lunch menu doesn't start until 11:30. So I was forewarned that the wrap might take a little extra time and it was served at 11:40. What we did not expect was that his waffle that was ordered at 11:20 would not be served until we had finished the wrap. We shared the wrap so I wouldn't have to eat in front of him or wait for it to get cold waiting for his waffle to be served. Great idea since his breakfast waffle was not served until 11:55!!! So gad he ordered the waffle & not a savory breakfast dish, so we could treat it like a dessert But I rechecked the menu & yes there was supposed to be coconut cream on it so I went up to the server at the register to ask about the cream. \"Oh, it wasn't on there? Maybe they were out so they didn't put it on. But I can check for you\" Okay so that answer did not impress me, but it got worse, she continued to look confused at the register for 5 minutes, then served another table their food, took another table's order, gave a 3rd table (that had come in after us& was served before us) their check & then change, went back to confused look at register & then was heading over to clear the table she gave the check and change to when she must have overheard my guy's comment to me so 10 minutes after my requesting the cream, decided to go into the kitchen to get some. Of course by that time we only had a few bites of waffle left & the syrup had already completely soaked in so no clue what the waffle would taste like hot & fresh with all the fixings.  SO, the 3-stars for the attempt at good food that was not up to par because of really poor service. I may try this place again - if it is still open in a few months when they have had a chance to get the service issues fixed. Sad because I was looking forward to liking this restaurant with it's good reviews & that it is all vegan but I don't always have an hour for a quick bite. I know this isn't fast food, but if two people order food, please don't serve their plates 20 minutes apart.",

    "text": "I really have experienced better. And I haven't experienced much in my short life.   1. Over-priced- For what the food is, it should definitely not be over $10 a plate.  It was pretty basic food. As crazy as it sounds, I didn't find passion, love, or creativity in their food.  2. No character- Considering every aspect of the restaurant, it was all too bland. They had a lot of Latin inspired dishes (ok, maybe just names) that had no authenticity.The interior and set up they had was i guess bohemian or as my friends would say \"hippyish\" I would think that for a new vegan joint, they try to do something more out of the ordinary.  3. Fair cleanliness- For cleanliness to be on the fair side is pretty bad in my book. *The menus and Table were a bit worn out and dirty. Not too noticeable.. until you examine them.  *The women's bathroom was ok, just a dirty floor. My friend said that the men's bathroom was trashed. Paper's all over the floor, dirty mirror, floor, and sink.  *There was a hair in our food. I honestly would have taken it out and still eaten it, (knowing that they were just going to throw out the food, is a waste to me) but my friend was disgusted and sent it back. When the waitress carried it back to the kitchen, we noticed the kitchen staff had long beards and dreads. Which there is NOTHING wrong with, just keep extra watch on the food.   I honestly was disappointed and I know there should be a second chance given. Of course to support local vegan restaurants, I most likely will.    Although I do hope they strongly consider revising some setbacks they have going on. Another joint that has some potential.",

We called ahead to see how long it would be as the Yelp reviews say the wait may be long. They lady in the phone said 20 minutes. When we get there, the place is full but everyone is done eating. We sit at the bar area and nobody acknowledges us. We grab menus on our own since they are next to us. 15 minutes before someone gets out drinks. Then, once we get out drinks another 20 minutes until I flag down a man and tell him we are ready and that it's been 20 minutes. We place our order and the man tells me they are out of their homemade veggie patties but they can sub with a soy patty. Sure. Then he comes back and tells my wife they are out of the beef and broccoli she ordered. She then chooses a sandwich. Then, he comes back and tells me they don't ha e a soy patty for my sandwich! At this point, I'm so frustrated with they place I don't want to order another item. So we tell them to forget it we don't want to eat here anymore and we will pay for the drinks. The guy said it was on him! Thank god, because my wife's  smoothie was warm!!!! Ugh I was so excited to eat here. After this horrible experience, I will never go back no matter how good their food may taste!!!!",

We ate every meal but one here. Between the two of us we had: red rock nachos, the Violette club, the hippie chick burger, California dream in' burger, the godfather, el torro grange burrito, a country classic (my fav), country biscuits and gravy, red rockin chili, Mac n cheeze, potato salad, black bean corn salad, southwestern tofu scramble, veggie garden tofu scramble, sourdough toast, sausage link and party, pancakes, plus Apple and blueberry turnovers and a variety of milk, smoothies and juice. That should prove that the food was good enough to keep us coming back. Our waitresses were lovely people who made us feel like old friends. They create a very welcoming environment. We should probably move here because we are really going to miss the good and our new friends.",

Along the walls are healthy lifestyle books that Violette (the owner) has read throughout her years, and you are free to pick a book and read while you wait for your meal to arrive.  The place was pretty crowded when we were there, a man was having his birthday party at a table next to mine, and he was reading funny \"over the hill\" humor cards from friends of his out loud... he was only turning 40 Behind the register I saw a colorful chalkboard with varying organic juice recipes that can be made on demand.   I ate a delicious burrito with rice, beans, vegan cheese, sauteed onions and a DELICIOUS tangy (cheese like) sauce with green onion a-top it, served with vegetables (grilled I think) and organic non-gmo purple corn chips. *The burrito was chipotle Size*, It was suggested to me that I share or that I would have leftovers. I finished 5/6ths of it, and shared the rest with my GF.   My GF got a sandwich on sourdough bread, faux meat that is made from barley wheat, as well as lettuce, avacado and vegan mayonnaise. .. and maybe something else... , IT WAS DELICIOUS. oh yeah, & hers came with organic baked french fries and organic ketchup   Saying VEGAN or ORGANIC is redundant with these guys, because EVERYTHING is VEGAN and EVERYTHING is ORGANIC ! :)   It was definitely more expensive than eating at home, but there were:   GOOD VIBES GOOD BOOKS & FREE WIFI   so we'll be back :)   Thanks Violette and Staff !",

My husband and I shared the Tempeh Buffalo Sticks which were yummy. He said they could have used more buffalo sauce , but overall great choice. We also got the Philly Steak Sandwich with Potato Salad. The sandwich was unbelievable. It tasted just like a greasy, traditional philly; but animal free. They brought us french fries instead of the potato salad which I had to point out to them. They took care of it by bringing us the potato salad and a lucky bonus because we got to try the fries. The potato salad was a nice surprise because I've yet to see creamy vegan potato salad. The french fries were the perfect saltiness and a nice additional treat. Prices and portions were reasonable. This will be a regular stop for us when in Vegas.",

The food was good and dessert was even better! Chocolate cake was satisfying! I am making this my number one go to vegan restaurant because I had quality service and good food. service matters so much to me as well cleanliness and they are good on both! Especially after having such a terrible experience with both of those things at vegenation. I know where I am treated fairly and that's what I'm sticking to from now on.",

The gentleman working there was a bit overly friendly he told me I was beautiful once and I kindly accepted his compliment but that seemed to be the topic of conversation throughout my meal. I said hey I'm gonna run to my car real quick just to grab something didn't want you to think I was leaving, and he said oh no you're too beautiful for me to let you run away. Then he asked what my paper work was for and I told him for a new pool club his response was I would come visit you anytime so let me know when you'll be there. Then while dropping off my meal asked if I ran for Miss Nevada because I'm too gorgeous not to.. So on and so on. It made me really uncomfortable and I couldn't wait to rush out of there. It's not just the words but some eyebrow movements and looks as if I were a vegan dinner. I didn't like feeling that way. It's one thing to compliment but gosh leave a woman alone and don't string on a conversation regarding only her looks and beauty. It was a little creepy. I won't be back.",

    "text": "My third time eating here and I thought it was time for a review. The place is cute with their decoration and just an overall peaceful atmosphere.  Service is decent. That goes for backhouse/ kitchen, which I'll explain in a bit, and the front of the house. The times I've went the servers have been helpful with recommendations. But tonight I tried to order a smoothie for pick up and was given an excuse that the staff who normally makes the drinks called off and that she didn't know how to make any of the juices/ smoothies.. I thought this to be quite interesting. Being a server/ food handler myself I would think the management would want you to know everything about the menu and how it's made. But anyways.. I've ordered the same things over and over, cheese cauliflower, tofu buffalo sticks, violettes purple power, green lava, and the coconut lemon cake. All were very tasty and actually quite good. I was impressed with the smoothie and cake for sure.  But tonight when I got my buffalo tofu sticks they were literally thrown into a box. No presentation like the last time i ordered it (with celery sticks and foil underneath to help with the buffalo sauce). My cheese baked cauliflower tonight was also extremely disappointing!!! Seriously I don't even think it was baked/cooked. It definitely did not look nor taste the way it did when I ordered it the first time...  CONSISTENCY of the quality of the food and service will definitely help better this place. Your workers from the front to the back of the house need to care about that..  Anyways this restaurant is definitely not one of my constant \"go tos\", but I guess here and there it will be an option.  From the looks of the comments, your customers hope to see more improvements.  Thank you!",

They had incense and a little personal mirror... Kind of like a little vanity area. They have positive sayings on the wall such as \"hello gorgeous\"   We ordered the red rock nachos. They were delicious. I wish the portions were a little bit bigger and the vegan cheese sauce got cold pretty quick. The tomato soup was pretty delicious. The chili soup was wonderful!!!

Well this is the first establishment the wife and I tried in Las Vegas and we were not disappointed. The owner of the establishment is Cindy Violette who is a former World Series of Poker champion back in 2004.....so I found that interesting. So when we walked in we seated ourselves and waited about 10 minutes before our waitress came to our table. The establishment was very clean and the customer service was good.  Now to the food.....I had the Rise n Shine Platter which came with Seitan Sausage.....which was surprisingly delicious......Yukon Gold Potatoes.....sauteed veggies......Tofu Scramble with Daiya Cheese.....and Toast. My wife had the Sunrise Superman which consisted of a BLT Sandwich......home fries and Sauteed Veggies. We had to wait 10 more minutes after we finished our meal to get the check but that was fine.....LOL!!!!!! The food was awesome and for 25 bucks for the both of us it was definitely worth it.",

I'll be honest, I ordered from Postmates a while back and I was disappointed, after leaving a less than stellar review one of the manager/owner contacted me and gave me a gift card. I stopped by today on my way home to grab some lunch and give this place a second try.  I ordered their beet juice with ginger, a chocolate chip cookie and their Love Bowl, all of which was pretty kick ass! The service was great, the girl at the counter with the dreads was really nice helped me figure out what I would like, I was worried the best juice mix would be too sweet so she recommended to put in some ginger to spice it up and it was so yummy I drank most of it before I got my food! The cookie was surprisingly really good, and the portion size for the Love Bowl is large and delicious. I like my food on the spicy side and though they didn't have the hot sauce I like they worked with me to add some red chili's and garlic to help spice it up. Point being, I had a good experience here, the food is good with fair pricing and good portions. I'll be coming back again for sure!",

I ordered their 3x piece breakfast options and ordered the pancakes and requested them to be chocolate chip(omg so fire) and then potatoes and their facon (fake bacon) which was all so delicious. I also had their lentil soup which was good as well. I love that they have a nice variety of options to eat. Highly recommend it. Oh not to mention that the setting is just the right vibe with all the extraordinary art work and amazing staff who made sure we were taken care of. Shout out Mason & Dawn!!",

However this place is a dream come True, high quality ingredients, great value and impeccable service.  Our server was Crystal, she's positive vibes x 10, on top of her game and very kind. Order cauliflower bites or zucchini zen sticks to start. The red rock nachos are popular, didn't have them myself, but I'll be sure to order them next time in town.  We shared the burrito, mama mia and love bowl, all were amazing. Side wise everything was phenomenonal, the yams, black bean salad, and steamed veggies on the side. A surprise side winner was the fabulous fries! Lastly the decor and overall atmosphere was top notch! This place is a must.",

The fries that came with it were good too. I got a juice decent. now... my daughter got a tropical smoothie and it was crazy chunky and she wouldn't drink it. I am drinking it only becuse it was $8. She liked the fries too. My husband got the potato salad and it came with a very long hair in it... she brought us a new one and he liked it, but she wasn't too overly concerned about it.  his smoothie, the date me, was also super chunky. three of us eating lightly came to $56- definitely not worth that kind of money. the ambiance is inviting but we won't be returning.",

Firstly, coming from Santa Monica were there is a plethora of vegan restaurants, all in a 15-20 minute radius, we're always cautious of what other state's vegan bistros have to offer. But Violette's Vegan has definitely set a high bar. The atmosphere is absolutely beautiful.The Caesar salad was one of the best (if not the best) we've had, the Nachos were delicious, and the Eggplant Parmesan sandwhich, (recommended by our wonderful waitress Emily)  was in lack of a better word... Perfect.  If Violette's vegan had a branch in LA, it would definitely be a regular spot. And we cannot wait to return.",

Maybe because it was really busy but I ordered a chili cheese dog, but it came with hardly any chili and the bread wasn't complete.

Then, we actually started visiting.  I'm not sure why I keep going back...probably because I would LOVE to see them succeed.  But, I have yet to have an even remotely positive  experience at Violette's.  Too many reasons to list at this point, but I'll try:  -horrible, inattentive service.  Friendly, but worthless.  Plates and such are left on the table after empty.  They never know what menu items are 86d until AFTER you order... -the pace is ridiculous.  You will be there forever no matter what you order. -that's IF they even have what you ordered.  Most of the menu is not available on any given visit. -often, the price on the menu was different than what printed on the check. -while the menu seems exciting, everything I've had lacks even minimal salt or pepper. -inconsistency with items ordered.  A side of avacado, one day, may be a sliced half....another day, a whole avacado just cut in half and served with a knife. -the hours change CONSTANTLY.  This was the straw that broke that camels back today.  We showed up for breakfast at 1020am to find yet another new sign with new hours posted.  And we were JUST there a few days ago.  So now you have one set of hours on Yelp, another on their voicemail, a set on the front of the building...and now this handwritten note.  Uhhhhh.....is that everything?  I understand making adjustments.  I get that the 1st year of opening a restaurant is very trying.  I do.  I am also the most patient person on the plane, but I've had enough.  It will be many months before I return.  At some point management needs to reach out for help.  They need someone to train the front of house, back of house and tweak the menu.  They need to listen to the complaints that are repetitive.",

The food is incredible, the atmosphere is comforting, great location with a sweet boba spot next door or Madhouse Cafe for a treat afterwards. One thing they could improve on is wait time. Sometimes Ill find myself waiting well over 30 minutes for my meal but its worth it as the food is great, and everything is house made to order. Some of my personal favorites include the Beef and Broccoli, El Toro Grande Burrito, Shinto Steak Sandwich, Country Classic, Red Rock Nachos, and their Breakfast Wrap Supreme (tip: tell them to put cheese in it!). Above all Violettes Vegan is an incredible spot for vegans to get a good meal and walk out the door satisfied, especially for Summerlin/West LV where its hard to find good vegan eats. Also dont scoff at the dessert options. Theyre all freaking incredible.",

We grabbed menus at the entrance and as we were excitedly looking through them, the server told us that menu was only for dinner. She then gave us the breakfast menu and as we were looking through them for a good 5 minutes, she took away the \"special\" page and told us that was only for weekends. Okayyyy.... So why is it in the menus? Why not hand them on the weekends then. Weird but no big deal.   Now that we can't order some of the things we thought we can, we continue to look through our other options. As I was looking, a whole cup of ice water poured all over me. It would have been refreshing if I was on a hike in the Vegas heat but I was sitting under a AC vent blasting cold air at me while this shocked the F out of me. She pretty much did the ALS challenge on me.  It got all over my LV handbag, the right side of my body and my butt. She said sorry and handed me a towel to clean up. After that it was as if nothing happened. I felt no sincere apology or any acknowledgement.  I would have walked out but my family looked hungry so I stayed and ordered my meal.   Check came with no apologies. After the server charged my card, she gave me a tiny piece of carrot cake to said this is for spilling water on you.  What if was coffee or juice? That was poorly handled. I'm glad it didn't happened to my son and on me instead. She pretty much did the ALS challenged on me.  My stuff which cost more than a little piece of carrot cake was soaked and my bag has water damage. I had to walk out with a cold wet butt.",

We started with a maple bar donut (from Ronalds served at Violettes) and coffee with almond milk and raw sugar. Then I had the build your own breakfast with scrambled eggs, pancakes, sausage patty, potatoes  and sourdough toast. Everything was delicious and so hearty and good. Pancakes are the best I have ever had and the syrup yummmmm! I will for sure eat here again when I visit Vegas! I may even start experimenting a little with Vegan food. So glad I tried this! Service started a bit on the slow side and then picked up. The wait staff were very friendly and full of smiles! What a cute laid back cafe!",

    "text": "Still on a plant based diet and always look I g for a good vegan restaurant. Well I came across this Gem of a place and boy they don't disappoint. so my first impression when I walked in was it kind of reminded me of a hippie Style restaurant you would find in Humboldt County.. obviously dog friendly and you can sit outside in these cute umbrella cover tables and there's water bowls for your fur babies. Inside is is how I explained as hippie style to me. Servers and staff were very friendly.. the guest were a mix of business, regular Folk, hippie style Folk, folks that didn't seem like they would eat this food. Just every Walk of Life was here. Kind of refreshing to see. I started off with the energy shot. Taste like lemon grass. The grassy taste was an overwhelming and it tasted more lemony than anything. Kind of had a grassy aftertaste. But it wasn't horrible and it went away pretty quickly. I then ordered the California Dreamin because always looking for a good burger without meat or dairy. The burger comes out and it looks like a cheeseburger. I thought well let's see how it taste. I got to say it was a pretty damn good cheeseburger. Funny thing is that it's vegetarian. No meat or cheese. I would eat it even if I wasn't on a plant-based diet. A good cheeseburger is good no matter how you look at it and to have it healthy also is win-win to me. The the french fries sus like any other fries awesome as usual. The ranch dressing was pretty awesome for the dipping. Buffalo sauce was good too. I also ordered dessert. I ordered the baklava. It was pretty good A little more cinnamon and chewy then I like but it was good. but the star of the show was that cheeseburger as it should be. It was tasty, filling, and to know that it was good for me. Violette's vegan gets two thumbs up for me. It's a little more pricey I think it was like 14 bucks for the burger and fries but he'll it was worth it. I would recommend this place to anybody.. and I mean anybody. Vegan, not vegan, carnivore, omnivore, it doesn't matter. This is just a good restaurant with great food.",

The long story: Shared the egg plant and linguine, the garlic bread was something to write to yelp about, you could taste the garlic. My son ordered the fried chik'n meal and while it was generally a yellow/brown color palette it was comfort food at its finest. My youngest son ordered the spaghetti and meatballs kids dinner. That \"meat\"ball, so full of flavor! (corn bread was dry, but good)  We ate alfresco and the atmosphere was pleasant and clean. The inside too was very clean. Our two different servers were so nice, helpful and talkative. They answered all of our questions.   I will definitely be back again and again (and in Vegas world, its not super close to where I live)",

I love the concept and wish more restaurants would have vegan, organic and gluten-free options. I will continue to eat here, and hit me up if you want to throw a meetup here.

Herbivores or anyone like me that occasionally swings that way should add Violette's Vegan to what has grown into a decent rotation of meatless meals around town.  I didn't have an great dinner, but I think that's on me and my poor decisions.       \"Red Rock Nachos\":  Waitress recommended.  While plentiful and filling, the vegan cheese sauce was the biggest difference between this version and a typical plate at a video poker bar and it was just OK.  Perhaps melted shredded vegan cheese would have been a superior alternative.    \"Mama Mia\": The eggplant parmesan was better than I thought it would be.  The breading was delicious with the plant based mozzarella substitute being surprisingly good.  The only minus was the flimsy, overdone pasta.  I have NO clue what came over me in ordering this entree. I could've had this at any great Italian eatery!!!  Did I check my brain at the door??  Total choke job by me.  Rarely happens.  Figures I do it in a vegan joint of all places!!  Ha!     \"Shangri La Sunset\":  My wife's choice only because they didn't have the rice bowl she wanted.  Seitan chicken stir-fried with vegetables was a decent, healthy dish, but it just had me longing for another veggie place on Spring Mountain.  I grounded out, she flew out.    In the end, I misclicked this whole experience and wished to press the reset button.  We plan on getting the Hungry Man, Samurai Burger, Bubba Ke Bubba and falafel next time.  Hoping to go back soon and right my wrongs.",

Usually we don't bother trying to replicate the taste of meat and this sausage reminded us why! Probably more our issue than that of Violette's.  And we split a piece of chocolate cake....heaven, just plain organic vegan heaven.  No other words to describe it, just heaven.  I haven't eaten chocolate cake in 20 years...but I might just start again.  Great place to have a quick meal or spend an afternoon eating and visiting and relaxing.",

I had been here once before with some non vegan friends and they were super impressed and would certainly me Back without me! That was a shocker!   I Arrived just as they opened... And we just came over she mentioned that she had a very large to go order prior to mine. I totally understand wasn't in any hurry, but it did take about 20 minutes for my order. Others that were waiting experienced about a 30 to 35 minute wait, but the waitress came over to every single table and offered a bowl of soup to satisfy q the app j during their wait.... that's what I call service!   The location is easy to park, it's very clean and neat beautiful pictures and of course... An awesome juice bar! I will be back again and again! Great job guys!",

    "text": "It's always like, *almost* great. But some parts are always a bit off.  The fried chicken meal is really good. I've had them both as sticks and as patties, both of which taste good. The flatter ones are better, so I'm glad it seems they've switched to that.  The mashed potatoes are pretty good, but just because it's vegan doesn't mean they need to sacrifice creaminess. I make vegan mash that's creamier, but their rosemary gravy makes it better than I can do.  The cornbread is dry, and the corn is flavorless. I have replaced the corn with the steamed vegetables before, and they were also super bland. Why?! For a place that seasons fake meats so well, they should know how to season vegetables! I don't get why they leave them so bland. Not even salt.  Both the buffalo and teriyaki cauliflower dishes are great. I'd opt for less breading, but I guess that's personal preference. I'd still order it again. Their club is soooo good. I hate tempeh and seitan, yet here I am, talking about how dang good it was. Their fries are also decent.  For drinks, I like the Amazon fuel thing even though it doesn't taste like chocolate or coffee. It's just a weird date drink that I like. Their cake was a bit sweet for me. Still good. I know I'm picky overall, but legit, my one major note is that they need to flavor their veggies. Some vegan butter, salt, and garlic can go a long way. I took it home and seasoned it myself, which I hate having to do. But yeah. I'll go back, of course. I just hope they work on some items.",

So happened we got the lentil soup it arrived quickly which was nice because we were hungry and the water was crisp and refreshing not like some places were the water is straight faucet water . While we waited for the main course we used the angel cards that were on the table something unique overall we enjoyed the experience. Give this place a try!  We have vegan channel at YouTube (TBVEGAN) Also on Instagram (TBVEGAN)  We do reviews for vegan restaurants, bakeries, and vegan recipes Check us out :)",

    "text": "Since I recently moved to Vegas, Violette's Vegan has been my go to spot because it's the only place that serves all organic. Organic is important to me as I am a cancer survivor.    I like the juice bar a lot and usually have the grateful greens, it's very healthy. The price is 7.95 for organic, that's reasonable. I don't know how they keep their prices down. Organic is expensive. So it's great to find a restaurant that cares about my health.    The food is delicious. My favorite things to order so far are the Cesar salad, the Pad Thai and the Love Bowl. Usually I don't eat out more than once a week because it's hard to eat out organic. I am happy to find a place that caters to my health needs, so I can eat here regularly.  Yesterday was the day I really smiled though. I broke down and had the red velvet cake milkshake. I swear I never had a milkshake that tasted like  cake!! It was worth the cheat!!! :D  The servers are all sweet and efficient . All my special requests are not a problem. Being an hippy I love the decor, the books, tarot cards and positive sayings all around. I feel like I'm home. Great find!!",

It has a huge menu that's 100% vegan, and it includes things I miss like pancakes and quesadillas. The decor and restaurant environment is wonderful. Very new, clean, and colorful.   However, the service is super slow! Relatively simple dishes take at least 30 minutes on average.   Do not get the Samurai Burger. It is absolutely disgusting. It legitimately tastes like snails. I rarely leave food over, and my friend is a huge eater, but we couldn't choke it down even between the two of us. In all seriousness, I could not describe it in any way other than Bitter Essence of Snail. It should be called the Snail Burger. By far the worst burger I've ever had in my life. I felt nauseous for hours afterwards.   The last time I visited, I was so excited to get vegan pancakes. SO EXCITED. But taking that first bite of that corn cake was one of the saddest moments ever. They gave me sad, gluten-free pancakes. I looked over at the other table as they enjoyed their normal, delicious-looking pancakes and stared down at the sad, yellow, grainy excuse for pancakes on my plate. (Definitely never ordered gluten-free, ew). I hope this is not a common mishap, because I'm just not the type to complain or send food back.   I still want to come back, because the menu is so attractive and vegan. And I just want to try their regular pancakes, darn it.",

Our service was slow and after nearly ten minutes of looking at the menu, the server THEN decided to tell us they were out of all vegans cheese AND marinara sauce, that's literally half the menu. We ordered 3 entrees and one appetizer, we waited well over 20 minutes and the appetizer came out when we were close to finished with our food.   I am willing to give this place another chance, but from what I hear it is not uncommon for them to run out of the most basic ingredients. I hope it is an issue they are able to address, otherwise they will most definitely lose a lot of business. I am rooting for them, I want it to succeed, it's a lovely little place.",

    "text": "To the point, food was just okay.   Ordered the El Toro Burrito. Was told it'd take 15 minutes. Appreciated estimated time given but still questioned 15 minutes for a burrito. Actual time waiting for burrito, a little over 25 minutes.   Ordered this for a friend and after she took a bite, she thanked me and asked if I wanted the rest. Sadly this $16 burrito was a complete waste of time and money. Filled with rice and veggies, served with chips and side vegetables topped with cheese. No seasoning whatsoever, completely bland. Ended up in the garbage after I took a bite.   You're better off eating at Madhouse Coffee in the same complex that offers vegan dishes that have actual flavor. Or head further down on Spring Mountain to Veggie House. Head downtown and check out Bronze Cafe or to chef Stacey at the Container Park.",

The less good news is that on the whole, everything we ordered was very underwhelming.  I ordered the Nature Girl salad, it was mostly wilted lettuce and did not come with house ranch dressing as advertised, instead it arrived with an olive oil dressing. Blah. We also ordered the California Dreamin Bacon Cheeze Burger and found it just ok. For my kids, I ordered the grilled cheese and they wouldn't eat a bite of it, said the cheese tasted weird. They did eat a few fries but abandoned those as well. I LOVE good vegan food, but this wasn't good vegan food. This was the kind of vegan food that makes vegans look bad.",

    "text": "This is an update to my previous review.  Now that Violette's Vegan is open for breakfast, I got the chance this past weekend to go there with my client/friend and we ordered the 'breakfast wrap' and 'gluten free waffle'.  We split the dishes so we could both try a little of each. Wow, they were very good! I was so satisfied, I didn't eat again till 8pm!  I've never had a breakfast wrap before and didn't know what to expect. I was happy to find that it was really delicious and filling.   The gluten free waffle was great too.  It came with fresh organic fruit and maple syrup, along with some tasty coconut cream topping!    It was all freshly prepared and made on the spot.  LOVE that about this place.  Next I will be trying the pancakes with blueberries :)  Since I visit violettes vegan A LOT, here are a few of my Fav's:  BREAKFAST: breakfast wrap and waffle (so far) LUNCH: festive falafel, rockin raw wrap, hippie chick & samurai burger,  DINNER: 2 burgers above, nachos, buffalo tempeh sticks, curry bowl, taco trio, mash potatoes and gravy. (some lunch items are also on the dinner menu)  DESSERT: As I'm not 100% vegan, and being brought up eating my grandmothers homemade cakes that were made with eggs and milk, I wasn't sure how a vegan cake would stand up against a regular cake, WELL... Chef Mark continues to amaze me with how divine and delicious vegan cakes actually are!  My fav is the cranberry orange, the others are also incredibly yummy!  Who knew vegan cakes could taste so good?!  I will be back again for breakfast very soon, as well as lunch, dinner and of course dessert, especially as they are tweaking / updating the menus and adding daily specials!",

    "text": "Service pretty good and I like that they have tarot decks at the tables... but, this review is more based off of price of my meal and the taste. I ordered a California burger and opted outta the vegan cheese and tomato. I don't really like either on my burgers. The burger come with avocado, pickles, lettuce, thousand island and tempeh(bacon). The patty was pretty mushy and tasteless. The entire burger actually lacked any flavor, which was odd considering it had all those ingredients on it. It didn't taste bad and the presentation was nice, it just didn't have flavor. The fries were ok. Not my favorite though. Now this meal cost $14 which I find to be outrageous. I would come back and possibly try other items on the menu because there is still potential there and they have a decent sized menu. I recommend veggie way if you want a good tasting vegan burger. A burger and fries over there is around $7.",

Great deal .. couldn;t finish them & waitress said no one has yet so ..   Next time we brought re-enforcements !! My wife put us over the top !! We were able to finish but I was disappointed we didn't receive a plaque or get our name on the wall   We've had & loved the Mac n Cheese & the veg burger + I loved a salad I had with mint but can't remember the name ...   Only warning I can give is the 1st two times we went they were closed btwn 3-5 pm .. so beware .. otherwise great food & a great environment !! Can't wait to go for breakfast !!",

Our waiter Chis was a sweetheart and he was very attentive, for starters I ordered their chili cheeze fries and those were so fresh and delicious!! And then I ordered The Philly which was very flavorful and yummy with potato salad (which btw was delicious too) and my son ordered their CALIFORNIA DREAMIN BACON CHEEZE BURGER and oh my goodness!! It was ahhhmazing!! My son has been craving a burger lately (but didn't want to eat a beef one ever again) and this hit the spot and we were both so full when we left (I had to take half my sandwich for leftovers)and we can't wait to come back to try something new next time!! This is our new favorite spot!! Thank you!!  Update**took my Mom here to try (she's not Vegan) and she really loved her sandwich and Chris waited on us again (such a kind hearted soul)today I tried their Mac n cheeze and sunrise Superman sandwich and my son and Mom had the backyard bbq sandwich (of course with potato salad) everything was delicious and next time we come back we will try breakfast",

Dessert is very important to me and they hit the spot. Their coconut lemon cake, chocolate cake, and baklava are amazing. I haven't had baklava since going vegan and this one even tasted like it had honey in it!

I grabbed a to go order of the California burger, zucchini fries, and the red rockin chili. I really loved the chili it was very delicious. I liked the California burger until I found the reason why it didn't go from a like to love, it was the tempeh bacon, today I realized I'm not so much a fan. But!!!! I will say the soy burger, texture wise was excellent! You really could not tell from the texture that it was soy. I'll definitely order this burger again minus the bacon :), the zucchini fries were delicious and fresh, my only complaint would be a little more salt or flavor to the marinara sauce would have really brought the dish together. I can't wait to try the smoothies & desserts, they looked fabulous in the case.",

The owner/manager must have short staffed the servers because it took 20-30 mins for the server to get our orders written down and taken the kitchen.   The menu seemed visually enticing but it didn't quite deliver.  Yes, they had pasta with fake meat and pad Thai with fake meat but just because it's vegan doesn't mean quality has to be mediocre.  I feel like they're saying, here's a vegan dish. Take it or leave it.   I'm giving it 3 stars for the ambiance though. It was so boho chic and reminded me of fond memories of SoCal living.",

It's hard to suggest places knowing there's quite a bit of things she cannot have so my other best friend and I decided we'd give a vegan restaurant a try since it's only fair that she's always coming to anywhere and everywhere we suggest. I didn't know what to expect at all but just went with it. We all ordered a coffee and they both chose agave as their sweetener which was sweet enough and made the coffee taste really good. The waitress was very helpful with all the questions we had about how their sausage and bacon were made. I decided to get the rise n shine platter. I didn't know the eggs were made of tofu but they were my favorite and the sausage was made of Tempe which I had never heard of before that day. I personally enjoyed my meal and my friend bought us all the bacon to try since it was also made with something that's not meat but I forget what they had said to us. Anyway we enjoyed it and said next time We would love to try the nachos and maybe a dessert!",

And this place definitely has some great items...but there was one thing I wish I could have gotten a refund on it was so unappealing :-/  Let's start with the good: * The gluten-free waffles are GREAT! They have a coconut whipped cream on them! And with butter, syrup, and bananas, I've SMASHED these down a few times!  * The sausage seitan is a hands down winner.  * The corn chowder is some of the best I've ever had.  Now the bad... * The country classic... super disappointing. And the tempeh part of it was flat out gross. Tasteless potatoes. The greens weren't flavorful either. Yuck. * The coffee has never been good. And I'm perfectly happy with the pump coffee from Whole Foods coffee bar with some soy milk. * Dry cornbread. Unless that's your thing. * Bacon tempeh isn't good at all  The restaurant itself is cute and relaxing. Painted with bright colors.  The waitresses I've had feel more like nice girls getting your food than skilled waitresses who are on top of customer service. And I've had that kind of customer service at a few other vegan places. Almost as though being a hipster/trendy dressed vegan is enough to work at a place like this. Smile, know the menu, check on me twice, and speak up so I can hear you and see that you're confident and friendly!  If you're vegan, I'd stop in. But definitely ask what's the most popular on the menu.",

    "text": "Was in Vegas on vacation with my boyfriend this weekend and saw this place reviewed on a vegan travel blog.  Let me just say, if you are vegan, go here now.  If you are not vegan, go here now.  Everything was so good the first time we went on Friday that we had to go back a second time before going home. First time, on Friday afternoon, we ordered buffalo cauliflower, Philly cheese steak, and buffalo chicken sandwich.  Omg, everything was SO good. We came back late Monday afternoon because the b/f wanted to try the biscuits and gravy, I the muffin melt.  We also got the club.  Once again, they did not disappoint. We also ordered a peanut butter cup shake to go, also delicious.   We seriously wanted to order one of everything.  Food was fantastic, service was great.  Honestly, I bet you can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  I just wish we didn't live clear across the country, but I am sure we will be back again on our next visit out there!",

I walked into the restaurant, the waitress made definite eye contact with me but didn't greet and went back to doing something behind the register. Ordered online and asked for chili cheese fries instead of regular fries for my included side in the comments, but I guess they don't read the comments because I still got regular fries. On top of that the fries were soggy.    Worst part of all was that the food was just not good. I got the philly cheese sandwich. Bland and boring, this place evidently doesn't know what spices are. This is the sort of cardboardy food that makes people afraid of going vegan. There's definitely good vegan food elsewhere in Vegas, skip this place.",

    "text": "I came here because I had a coupon in my entertainment book so we ventured out to the west side to give Violette's a try. I really didn't know what to expect since I've never heard of them but I did see they had 4 1/2 stars. Walking into the restaurant we immediately noticed it's a pretty popular place since most tables were taken so that is immediately a good sign. We came in around noon time on a Saturday and offered us the breakfast/ brunch menu. Unfortunately there was some items we wanted to try on their regular menu, but if I understood correctly is only offered on week days? Thankfully we still found some options on menu suited toward our liking. Our server was Jeannie and she was so sweet and patient with us as it took us awhile to decide on what we wanted to order. I had the California Dreamin' Burger which was pretty tasty. The patty is made in-house which I can appreciate since it's a lot more healthier that way since it doesn't have preservatives and they control what goes in it. Everything inside the burger was fresh and can honestly say this was a solid vegan burger. The fries were tasty as well and did not look frozen. I even liked the ketchup that was served with it, apparently it's from Sprouts. I also had a taste of my cousin's potato salad as well and this was absolutely delightful. I've never had vegan potato salad before but I will glad take this over one made traditionally with mayonnaise. I don't live on this side of town, but I will definitely be back.",

    "text": "I have been wanting to try this spot since last July!! It's not always easy to win when picking a restaurant when your the only vegan in the family household! But finally took my Kiddos here for a mommy n me dinner date!  Son wasn't too excited as he doesn't always love to eat vegan but he really enjoyed his \"chicken nuggets\" and fries as well as my daughter.   Service wAs good. And the restaurant itself resonates with me on like a level 10000000000000x from the decor, energy, books to read and family things to do  already know it's an absolute fav.   I'm only giving 4 stars now bc it was moderately busy and possibly just understaffed for the evening so:  The wait was a little long, however food still came out prettty good.  I was a little bummed they didn't have a gluten free pita option for my falafel pita and I would have liked it wth WAAAAAY More greens/veggies.   We also ordered:  A strawberry, chocolate and vanilla shake that took over an hour  The waitress warned us a little after we placed order that there were a lot of drink orders so it would be a bit so I appreciated the heads up- didnt expect it too take so long but I saw that they took it off the bill so I appreciated that  They all had very different consistentencies and came out 15-20 mins apart but then again, free so can't complain lol  There was only one waitress serving all tables and she kept a good attitude and has a chill energy so I didn't mind too much   I really enjoyed the restaurant reading the menu and books/playing games with my kids etc while we waited  I will absolutely be back and next time I'm sure everything will go perfect including all the food  I think the menu and prices are good/fair   Can't wait to try EVERYTHING",

    "text": "This restaurant is mediocre at best. I've been here twice (with about 6 months between visits) and the food missed the mark both times. Such a bummer to write this, because I love to support vegan restaurants however I can. However, this place has some work to do!  The first time I ordered the Love Bowl (rice and veggies) and it came out swimming in sauce. It was, like, 20% veggies and rice and 80% sauce. I like a light sauce, so I just couldn't down it. It felt like I was eating spoonfuls of oil. So disappointing.  The second time I also ordered the Love Bowl, but I explained to the waiter what happened last time and insisted on light dressing. And...it came out swimming in sauce again! He did apologize and take half off the bill, but I didn't eat much of it because, well, it was swimming in oil. So unappetizing. I feel like it would still come out drenched in oil even if I ordered the sauce on the side!  The bathroom is also gross here, so I'm deducting another star for that. It smelled so bad that I just couldn't use it. Someone needs to get in there and do a deep clean ASAP.  A lot of places on the strip can whip up something vegan if asked. Next time I don't think I'll venture out just because this is a dedicated vegan restaurant. Pass.",

It's located near a pet grooming place so you already know I was pressed against my window looking at all the puppies that came in and out of the area.  Server Kirk was kind and offered suggestions on the menu which worked out beautifully.  The burger..  THE BURGER. Ok.. so I've had lots of veggie type burgers in my time but I believe this place had one of the best ones. I ate the California one with the chili cheese fries.. amazing.. the fries also I was a little worried about because... vegan cheese.. I'm a noob in that field but not anymore! The standard has been set... for the vegan cheese anyway lol.  overall experience was great.. the only thing that makes me sad about this place is the price. I would like to eat here more often but I can't spend $50 per meal for two people. Other than that.. this place is solid.",

I found my tofu scrambler, the Rise & Shine. I also opted to add the fruit.  The food looked great when it came out, and it tasted great too.  It's a good size platter, filled me up.

I got a free chili with my first check in and that was good. The service was good and the food was great. The only reason they didn't get 5 stars was because I didn't get the Oreo cupcake I asked for. I'd give it a 4.5 because I wasn't charged for it but a half isn't an option.   It's really nice to order off a menu without asking \"what's in this\"",

It was disappointing. Romaine lettuce, maybe 10 garbanzo beans,  and 2 slices of cucumbers (that were cut in half) then a pinch of sprouts.  The dressing was also not very impressive.

The service is why I'm rating it a 3, my friend and I came in and there was only 4 other people sitting. Two looked already done. Waitress was more bland than the ranch. I felt so weird. Also my friend said no tomatoes or pickles but she still got them, someone didn't write the ticket correct or read the ticket correct.

I'm a total foodie in general, so I figured this place would have awesome vegetable dishes and a few \"alternative versions\" of classics like burgers and such.    What. A. Disappointment.  It was like the vegan version of mediocre diner food. SO much of what's on the menu is fried food. Like, I'm eating plants to be healthier, why would you make all that healthy food unhealthy by deep-frying it?    We ordered one of the burgers, the faux chicken wings/fingers, the eggplant parm, and the nachos between 3 of us and shared it all.  As a nacho lover, I was severely disappointed. Not just the vegan cheese (which wasn't that bad), but the chips, the toppings, nothing had flavor. And come on people - it's NACHOS, can we get a little heat??  The burger had great reviews and I was so excited about it, but we couldn't eat it between 3 of us (and I love veggie burgers). Overall, the food lacked flavor and spices. Everything was bland (again, much like a mediocre diner). I feel like they really had an opportunity to kick things up with flavor and just decided not to.  The eggplant parm could have used garlic, onion, anything!  Honestly - the best thing I ate was the steamed broccoli.  I wish I could say I'll be back, but alas, I'm back on the hunt for a vegan place with will impress even the meat-eaters in my life.",

Atmosphere had that hippie massage feel vibe and the our server was nice. The reason I'm giving this place a 2 is the lack of respect for the singer that performed that day.  You don't call out a couple and say if you met on TINDER. WTF? you don't know us. Her dry sense of humor was disrespectful.

    "text": "I stubbled across this place during my lunch break on Friday. Recently starting my vegan journey (well.. I don't want to call myself a True vegan and be disrespectful to those who are.. so, I recently started my journey of not eating meat) since Labor Day. It's been so hard for me trying to find a place that could fill me up to what I'm use to when I was eating meat, but still be reasonably priced. The staff was very helpful when walked in to look at the menu at the counter. There was a gentleman who was at the counter, but I couldn't tell if he was a customer or manager/owner (he was very helpful in suggesting a few items). I decided to go with the buffalo chicken and I had a peanut butter shake (it was called something else- so I apologize to staff for the misrepresentation). The food was delicious(I was very surprised when I went back to work and ate at my desk). The shake wasn't bad. I'm not much of a chocolate or cocoa person, so I could taste what seemed like some form of Chocolate more than the peanut butter. I didn't expect for it (shake)to be as thick in texture as a milkshake but it was still a nice treat to have on a Friday afternoon. I will definitely be back to bring someone or people with me next time.",

I just recently transitioned to veganism and I saw the amazing reviews on yelp. We saw that you all were only 2 miles away. My mind was BLOWN when I had my first bite of my Hippie Chick burger! The Red Rockin' Chili was to die for. It was so great we came back again, and again! Each time the food got better. My love and I & our little daughter really enjoyed it. I am so glad we found this place because we will definitely be back.   Aside from the food, the waitresses were one of a kind. They played with my daughter and were so talkative and friendly.  P.S. the carrot cake is MY FAVORITE! I have a major sweet tooth and I seriously cannot believe how amazing the carrot cake was.  If you want incredibly healthy, organic, VEGAN food.. come here!!!",

    "text": "First off let me say the food here is amazing! I got a Hottie Chick burger with fries. The atmosphere is relaxed and chill. However, because of the service we received I rank this place so low.   I went with a group of four last Saturday mid afternoon. I asked initially for a Violette's purple powder smoothie which came with your choice of soy, almond or another choice of milk. When I ordered I completely spaced and didn't directly clarify which I wanted, and she didn't ask... someone in my group over head the worker making my smoothie say \"which milk did she want?\" And our server,blonde olderish lady, made up one which out even clarify.    When she came back to my table, I asked her what milk was made with my smoothie because I forgot to clarify and her response? ...\"Which milk did you want?\" Hmmm... that's not a good response to my question. I had a gut feeling no matter what I said (soy, almond) she would say whichever I said it was made with.   After that incident she was condescending to my entire group the rest of our visit. At the end of our meal I asked for a second burger Togo, and I cannot joke about this she says \"You want another one?\" With attitude in her voice. I was taken a back and shocked, I'm like \".....Yes, it is for my boyfriend\"   Needless to say they need to restaff and cut the attitude, won't be back.    To add, this server overly flirted with all males sitting alone at their table, she popped her bottom out at their table and her chest in their space. Inappropriate to say the least!!",

I gave the restaurant a call the gentleman was very nice and helpful he informed me the manager was not in but to give a call tomorrow and to explain the issues she would be  more than happy to take care of it. My roommate and I went into the restaurant the next day talk to the manager and she was so kind and helpful we enjoyed a great lunch in the restaurant then also asked her for recommendations on delivery entrees that would be good 15 to 20 minutes after they were made.  I am so glad we came in and talk to the manager she was so helpful and now we absolutely love this vegan spot.",

In addition, the service is painstakingly slow.  We waited almost an hour after ordering two appetizers, a kids mac'n cheese, and veggie burger. Most importantly the food is not good.  The mac n'cheese had no cheese flavor what so ever.  It tasted like overcooked pasta with salty cream sauce.  None of the other dishes were worth finishing either.   I give them two stars because the staff was extremely nice, even though the food was so slow.",

It was such a bummer because I heard the breakfast is awesome. It was great to see an all vegan restaurant and all their food is delicious. Also the strawberry milkshake is so amazing!!!",

But the wait for your meal and inconsistent service will really test your patience. So  tonight was my third attempt. I was greeted promptly and my order was taken several minutes after. Which I was so pleased with! The time before I waited almost 20 minutes. I ordered a gluten free quesadilla which took a little under 40 minutes. I wouldn't order it again. Just typing this out is making me nauseous. I'm sure with the normal flour tortilla, it's probably fantastic!  The girl told me after 20 minutes of waiting that they make the tortilla from scratch and it would take longer. Which, believe me, I know gluten free is tricky. But it tasted like an undercooked, soggy pancake. After finishing my meal (which I am currently paying the price for) it took about another 20 minutes to get the tab. At this point, it's just me, a guy who had been sitting for 15 minutes with no order placed (and the same desperate look on his face that I had on mine) and a delivery guy. Despite my negative review, I know a lot of people enjoy this place. Don't let this stop you from trying, just make sure you aren't in a rush. Also, the smoothies are worth it.",

I'm vegan but there is no need for you to be because the healthy food here tastes absolutely phenomenal.  My wife was looking for a salad place and I had always wanted to try this since it opened.  She got her salad and lots more!  The appetizer was guacamole and chips - a favorite of hers.  I like comfort food.  How about the aptly named \"Violette's Southern Comfort\" entry?  Collard greens and onions, tempeh that looked and tasted like chicken fried steak (!), and a large bowl of mac and cheeze to boot.  The dessert list was awesome too!  I was so full that I could only opt for the two scoops of ice cream (tofu based or almond based).  We had the tofu based and it was great.  It's comforting to know that Violette's is GMO-free and Organic among a whole list of other healthy attributes.  Violette's is definitely only two $$!  Unusual for such a healthy restaurant, and my wallet thanks you!  Our two entrees where $15 and $10 and the ice cream was $3.  If there is knock, unlike my other two favorites, the location is on Desert Inn and Durango which is too far for me to go for lunch as I work on The Strip.  The good news personally, is that it is relatively close to my house so that I anticipate having a lot of meals there before work or on days off.",

    "text": "If you are vegan, or even if you're not, you need to try this place.   Their menu, unlike a lot of vegan places, offers a wide array of protein types: from juice and smoothies, tempeh and tofu, to sprouts and grains. There are healthy options and less healthy (but still healthy) comfort food options.   We came here on a Tuesday night and were pleasantly surprised to learn there would be free entertainment in the form of a lovely singer who serenaded us through dinner.  The service here was spectacular. In the course of our dinner we were probably checked on 6 or 7 times, and the waitstaff was friendly, but not in that overly peppy way where you just want to yell \"Down, Fido!\" They were friendly in that \"Namaste\" way.   The food was incredible. You can really tell that every dish was made with the utmost care. The plates do take a long time to come out, but we did order a lot of tempeh, so I appreciate it was cooked perfectly, which is very hard to pull off.   We ordered:  - Cauliflower appetizer - Brunson's choice (buffalo tempeh sticks) - Buffalo tempeh sandwhich  Everything was delicious and soooo flavorful. It will make any carnivore do a double take.   My ONLY and only complaints:  Some of the plates were very very small. The cauliflower was literally a couple large florets that you could eat in two bites. Some forewarning about the plate size would be nice.   We ordered the baguette as the bread choice for the tempeh sandwich. It was over toasted, which made it difficult to eat because the bread was so dry and crunchy to the point where it hurt your mouth. I would suggest to the staff to either lightly toast this, or do not toast it all all. It did such a disservice to the lovely tempeh.",

    "text": "I came here for breakfast and the food was awesome..muy delicioso! I really love how everything is vegan and organic.  They are even eco friendly conscious by having plant based made straws with are bio degradable and they even have eco friendly maxi pads in the women's restroom :)    One draw back is that it reminds me of Pura Vida(another vegan restaurant).   The food took awhile to come out.  It seems like they make everything when you order it.  So you can't come here in a rush.  Give yourself an hour to get the meal and eat.  Next time, I'm gonna try to call my order in and show up at the restaurant like 15 minutes later to eat it there, lol.   On to the food...My group ordered 3 dishes and we all shared the food.   First dish: rise and shine platter...tofu scramble, potatoes, collared greens, breakfast sausage, and toast.  It was awesome.  The tofu scramble is on the spicy side, but it have it good flavor.  I loved the potatoes..It think it was just baked.  Even the toast seemed fancy and tasted good, lol.  Ooh, and I loved loved loved the breakfast sausage.  Second dish:  sunrise platter: BLT made with tempeh bacon, collard greens, and  potatoes.  This was my favorite!!!!-the BLT tasted so much like the real deal. Usually I'm not into fake meats, cuz it's always a hit or miss with me, but this bacon was da bomb!!  Third dish: multi grain waffles with mixed fruit: this was awesome.  It had coconut whipped cream, nom nom nom!! It made the waffles just amazing!! It was a perfect combination with the mixed fruit.    I already tried the smoothies and I love it too. I usually add the plant based protein for $1.25.  All the flavors are good, but my favorite is violetta's purple smoothie.  I definitely gonna be back and try the dinner menu...I can't wait to eat \"meat loaf\" lol.  Go check this place out, I'm sure you'll love it too.",

No one gave me a menu or helped me for several minutes. Finally the guy behind the bar asked if he could help me. I requested a menu. He gave me a glass of water with no ice or straw. The water tasted good, but it was strange how he served it.  I ordered a Nature Girl salad and the zucchini sticks.   The zucchini sticks were the high point. The breading is very crispy and tasted good. The sauce wasn't as salty as I like, but I probably eat too much salt. I would def recommend this dish. Yum  The salad was another story. Everything tasted good and fresh...just incredibly bland. The tofu was good. The dressing was served on the side and it was very thick. It had the consistency of cream cheese. It also wasn't the right choice for this salad. The salad was really bland and would be 100% better with a zesty vinaigrette.      After I ate I had to request my check. Sat for several minutes with my napkin on my plate and still no one brought my check.   Overall the food was fresh, but bland. The service was nice, but slow. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again.",

    "text": "I am SO GLAD my boyfriend and I chose to go here. I'm still smiling because of how great everything was! This is my new favorite vegan place in Las Vegas and I feel like this place sets the bar for other vegan restaurants in the future.  When we first walked in, there were a few other people there and a sign to seat yourself. We walked over to a table close to the bookshelf and immediately went over to it. I saw all sorts of vegan books and cookbooks and some coloring books so I grabbed the Care Bear coloring book and a handful of crayons out of the bucket they had. My boyfriend grabbed the Uno game (which still looked brand new, yay!).  We forgot to grab menus at the front so our server brought them over and we started looking. She brought water over to us within a minute or two of sitting down.   We had no idea what to get because we hadn't looked over the menu before but I had seen pictures on the yelp page. They were out of a couple of things so I asked our server about it. How hard it is to get everything organic and not trying to buy too much so that it spoils. Totally makes sense to me and I'd rather go to a place that serves quality ingredients instead of somewhere that might be using old, rotten produce!   So we ended up ordering the nachos and Mac n cheese as kind of an appetizer.... Wrong!! Wrong move! We should have known better! The pictures of the nachos didn't really do them justice... at all. They are stacked at least 6 inches high and are enough for two people to share for dinner! I didn't want to take them home (you know how nachos get after being in the fridge for a day) so I tried to eat as many as possible, as did my boyfriend. I loved the vegan cheese sauce and there was so much guac (my favorite) we couldn't stop eating because they were so addicting! The Mac n cheese didn't help at all, with how thick and rich it was. Heavenly but so filling!  Usually I say \"No Ragrets\" but there were... There were.  One of the other employees checked on us when we were almost done with the nachos and asked if they could get us anything else and we just laughed and said we were waiting on our sandwiches. The look we got was hilarious!! It was like, \"no way are you going to each eat a sandwich after all of that food\". I doubt many people do order anything else after those nachos!! xD  Right after we said we were waiting on our sandwiches, we heard the bell 'ding' to let her know they were ready. She grabs them and comes out saying \" I hope your guys are hungry\". Lol no.. Not even a tiny bit.  But we both stuffed as much in as we could because it's not every day you find amazing vegan food at such a great cost. Really! Everything was SO affordable and it made me so happy!! We still each had half of a sandwich left and our sides so we got some to-go containers and shoved it all in there the best we could.  The nachos held up alright when I ate the remainder that night and the sandwiches are in the fridge, ready to be devoured. I would definitely recommend the Backyard BBQ sandwich! It was on point. The club wasn't my favorite because I didn't much care for the herb tofu but it was still scrumptious.   I can't wait to come back and try the eggplant parm. This place is great! The service was perfect, the food was perfect, the prices were what I dream of, and I loved the atmosphere. I wish I wasn't a broke btch so I could come here every week.  Total, for our nachos, Mac n cheese, two sandwiches with sides, and giant slice of cake, it came to $38. Two appetizers, two main courses, and desert for less than $50? With enough leftovers to take home and do it all again? HECK YEAH! I love you guys!  K, I'm getting creepy. Thanks for the amazing service and food! :D",

Someone in my office is vegan so this is our usual go to place they are really good if you have any food allergies etc. Staff is awesome and friendly and the food is amazing! Their \"feel better\" shot has me feeling like a brand new person almost immediately ! It's a cute little place and there are spots to eat outside as well. The only plate I actually didn't like too much was the spaghetti (meatballs) they are good but there was something about it that we didn't tickle my fancy. I hear the beef and broccoli is amazing however I have never tried.  This place is super clean and has little tchotchkes on the table, also I don't have any kids but it seems they have a little play area for the kids.  Call in advance because sometimes the wait time can be a little long !",

Did wish the potatoes were a little spiced up like garlic or horse radish. Also had eggplant parm which was great.  The. IffLi wings weren't great, sauce wasn't hot at or buffalo sauce tasting.   Hope to head back again and try a few more things.   Oh the brownie was terrific!",

The waitress was alright, took a while for her to ask me for my order. The black bean burger was not very good, it wasn't the worst that I've ever had but it didn't stick together very well and it didn't have much flavor. I also got the chocolate cake which was very good and a great redeeming quality of the cafe.",

I get that it's supposed to be healthy and wholesome food, but there's no rule that it's not supposed to taste good. I believe I ordered 3 entrees, 2 desserts, and a side of fries. They had weird textures and off-tastes, even the smoothie. Very friendly staff and good customer service though. I probably won't be coming here again either, because it was also kind of pricey for what it was offering.",

They were all delish! My kiddo likes the mac and cheese and the lentil soup as well as the mashed potatoes and gravy. Hubby likes the Philly.  The servers are very nice but sometimes they are forgetful or just inexperienced. Be sure to order your child's food first so it comes out first. It happened to us once and other parents say the same thing - sometimes they bring out the adults' food and make the kids wait, which is a huge no-no in food service. But all the servers are really nice and they seem to like kids. There's also a few kids toys and things to do on the community bookshelf in the corner.  They deliver too. I can't review that aspect because I live outside the delivery boundaries but that's kind of cool that they deliver.  On thing - I feel like if they're going to be open for breakfast on weekdays then they should open at 6 or 7am for people who work. Instead, they open at 9. It's just kind of weird. I would expect a place like that to open at 10 or 11 on weekdays and then offer a Sunday brunch. But what they do is they serve breakfast from 9-11:30 and then lunch at 11-5pm (and then dinner). It's just odd to me. If you go out with a group at 10 or 11am you might want to do brunch, not just breakfast. And if you roll in at 12pm you might still want some breakfast foods. I just think brunch makes a lot more sense, but whatever, that's not a deal-breaker.  Again, the food is awesome.",

Like I said we all work in a restaurant and are servers, and are very picky when it comes to servers serving us lol, and they all rocked it!!!! Loveeee looooove loveeeeeeee it here, cant wait to bring my mom and son!  Thanks so much for an awesome night!!! -The D&D team",

When I approached our server with what the status is, he states the mac & cheese dish take about 20 minutes so that's why it's taking so long. Not once did he come to our table to ask if we would like more water ( which we did need ) or if we wanted our main dishes ( which were already ready according to him ). No customer service at all.

    "text": "My fiance and I came to Violettes Vegan expecting the same feel as all the other vegan finds in Vegas, an \"OK\" place with a few suggestions of how they could make the food more flavorful.  \"OK\" is an understatement for the experience we had.   The menu is absolutely vegan, so there is a complete sense of relief that there are no hidden food agendas to enhance the taste.   The next order of stress for the Vegan is, \"Is this going to be a squirrel portion of gerbil flavored food?\" Every single thing we ordered was delicious and well porportioned; not too much food and not too little. To quote goldie locks it was \"Just RIGHT!\" Yes I know this is a cheesy (but vegan cheesy) read!   The ambiance is also a 10 with friendly service, whimsical paintings, friendly and attentive staff, and books everywhere for the guest to enjoy at their table. They make fresh smoothies and their desserts are set adorably on display; believe me they are as moist & tasty as they look!  The only tip of advice I would suggest for the staff is to have their menus revised for grammatical errors, and choice of words as sometimes the clarifications on things like 'cheese' V.S. cheese was a bit confusing. But once we were told by the server that despite what the menu says, all of it is dairy/egg/animal free, this became the last thing we were focused on as we were enjoying all the goods!   We had an overwhelmingly positive experience here. We've been to several vegan friendly themed restaurants here in town, and this one stood out amongst the rest. Treat yourself to a slice of cake! You won't be disappointed. :) :)",

    "text": "First time customer. Great food. I recommend it highly.   Lots of variety. Creative menu. Might turn off those with inflexible and limited palates. But my wife and I loved the variety. Plenty to non conventional burger choices.   Main reason we chose it is because the quality of food. All organic. Sure it costs more but well worth it. You can feel the difference in the taste. Imagine top quality food that tastes exceptional. Unbeatable combination. Of course, we love shopping at Whole Foods and love Organic Foods to begin with so perhaps we are biased. It's easy to get used to the run of the mill food. Rare to find a restaurant committed to real quality. Most of the restaurants that make that commitment don't seem to be able to make a profit and go out of business. I sure hope that doesn't happen with this one.   We loved their fresh vegetable juice blends. They are a meal in and by themselves.   We indulged in the lemon coconut cake. So smooth. It was well worth it. Delicious. I would go back just for that treat alone.   We are also impressed with the decor. Great blend of bright colors. The art hanging on the wall was certainly a conversation piece.   Even if you're not a vegetarian it is well worth visiting. Open your mind and your taste buds and you will be pleasantly surprised. The experience made us give serious consideration to becoming committed vegetarians.",

For the price of the nachos, I'm hoping they adjusted those portions.   -Red rockin' chili is very good, and could possibly pass as a meat dish! Worth it.  -Sunrise superman should not be listed on the menu as a \"bacon\" substitute. It doesn't taste like bacon. As a matter of fact did not have any notably tasty flavors at all. Pass.  -Positively pad Thai was too sweet and also thick and grainy in texture. Pass.  Although I had a couple dishes I didn't love, I will be returning to try out other dishes from the menu!",

    "text": "So I was really excited to try this place as a fellow vegan. I came in with a friend and she had a coffee which was better than average and I stuck with water. I got the biscuits and gravy and she got BLT. With potatoes. After asking multiple times for cream for coffee they brought it out with the food. My friend's food was cold and not made correctly and My biscuits were hard and cold and the gravy had a nice flavor but was cold as well. It tasted like it was left out and reheated from a past meal. I originally ordered fruit as a side but they came to tell me as they brought me the food that they didn't have any. How do u not have fruit??!!  But they did have some sitting out for smoothies I guess that fruit was reserved.  All in all , poor customer service, poorly heated and unfresh food. But good decor and good coffee. Is it worth coming back? U tell me. I didn't have any smoothies maybe those make up for everything else.",

Definitely the place to go if your feeling nostalgic and craving something from before you went vegan. The service is good, everyone I've had as a server has been really nice and attentive. My favorites include the California dreaming burger, the sassy wings, the southern comfort, and the date me smoothie.",

I had creamy potato soup today which was so good! I wish it was permanently on the menu.  I love the zucchini sticks and the fries, idk why but vegan places always have the best fries. Bf loves all the sandwiches and burgers.  Everything you order will be amazing, but what I really love about this place is how colorful and relaxing it is. They play great music and have beautiful artwork everywhere. Servers are also very friendly!  UPDATE: they added potato skins and they are to die for!!!",

I highly recommend the sandwich! We also got the black bean and potato salads as sides. The potato salad was okay, but the black bean salad was PERFECT. Choose the black bean salad if you're debating between the two options.  The atmosphere of the restaurant is also awesome. The walls are colorful with gorgeous artwork. The general manager is extremely friendly and attentive. Overall we had an awesome experience and will definitely be coming back!",

    "text": "I wanted to write an update:  First off, I'm very glad that the owner reads the reviews and that she took the time to respond to my mine. I've been back dozens of times since as I love the food. I do have a few more observations to share.   Customer service does not seem to improve. I notice new employees every time I come so I assume that the turn over is pretty high. Most of the girls are not knowledgable and move Very slowly.  I was in with a girlfriend of mine a few weeks ago and we couldn't even get utensils even after the food dropped. No one paid attention to us. After I got up and asked for some I got a weird vibe about it. No ones comes by later to check on tables, at least this is what my perception was.   Last week I was dining at the bar and a woman came, new to the place, and asked for a to go menu. The girls handed her a business card. I would at least attempt to say something like \"we are paper free here, please visit us online to see a full menu\". The lady then took a dine-in menu and perused through. Finally, she hails one of the serves and said that she is ready to order. The two girls either didn't hear or they ignored her. She was becoming antsy and it was obvious she needed assistance. A server walked by her to look after guests who came in after her and she had to stop the girl in her path and explain she was asking for help, with a bit of frustration. The server's answer was \"oh... Okay.\" No apology or enthusiasm. Yikes.   On to me:  Last week I had stopped in three times. Once to pick up a 16oz drink-- I was given the smallest container I've ever seen. I am pretty certain that was not 16 oz. it looked more like 8oz. Starbucks grande cup is 16oz and what I got was half of that. I think the very Least a server should know are the serving sizes so that customers are not wasting their money. The Castaway smoothie was delicious though. Really awesome stuff. I did a small spoon of peanut butter instead of almond and it was excellent.   Second time that week I had a dinner special, I think. It was the Hippy Chick burger and it came with warm seasoned kale and a side of potato mash with gravy. This was absolutely incredible. My burger lacked mayo but I added some ketchup to it and it was great. I ate it with a side of cole slaw, which was also amazing but very Extra creamy. It was swimming in liquidy mayo. It was delicious but too creamy for me. I then ate the kale and mash together. I have to say this was probably the best potato mash I've ever had (other than the \"real\" stuff I make with butter and half&half). The kale was amazing with it, although a pinch too salty.   This was literally two meals in one and I was beyond satisfied.   On my third visit I had the falafel pita with cole slaw and a side of fries. The pita itself was absolutely incredible. I loved the texture. I am not sure if it's gluten free but it certainly was Awesome. Other than this, the dish was very bland. The falafels have an excellent potential but were seriously under seasoned; also there were still half bits of chickpeas in them. I'm not sure if this is done on purpose. The mix could have used a lot more cumin, salt and pepper. They were also very crunchy on the outside but not in a good way. They were tiny bits of something that for me, makes me fear I'll chip a tooth. If a little more TLC was put into the preparation, the falafel would have been amazing.   The hummus inside my pita was flavorless. Literally, it was just blended chickpeas. There was no salt, no pepper, I could not taste tahini in it nor lemon juice.  I asked for tahini in my pita and tzatziki on the side. I did not taste any tahini in there. You can't miss it, it's a very earthy distinct taste. I guess they forgot to tell the chef. Also, a stuffed pita without onions is like milk without a cookie. The flavor profile was seriously undermined with that omission.   I had to put a ton of pepper and a bit of salt to pump flavor into this dish. I also added a squeeze of lemon juice. These three things alone elevated the dish to another level.   My fabulous fries came out without seasoning. I also had to add salt and pepper to them. The cole slaw was perfect amount of creamy and well, that's about it. No salt, nada. I added lemon to it to which helped immediately.   I feel the chef who worked that day absolutely despises seasoning because everything was so bland and flavorless.   I have to say that a $10 dish, where a customer gets 3 falafels and a bland experience, is overpriced. Across the way, Sababa's makes a Killer falafel sandwich with the Works for like $8.   Side note: I sat at the bar for an hour and half looking at a dirty table to my left. It was cleaned up right before I left. There were other tables that weren't bussed but this one was a mess for quite a long time.   I'll keep coming here because I love the food. I know that in this business we all strive to improve and be better & training our staff to be more observant and in charge is key.",

    "text": "Brief Overview: This is a great organic and Non-GMO restaurant that combines the foods you've known and loved growing up, just in a vegan version.  Pros: - Their regular/baked cheese cake is so good that I savor every bite (I can't even tell it's vegan) - Their waffles and pancakes are absolutely delicious (I leave feeling happy) - The food is top notch and the owner Cindy is such a kind and giving woman (love her to death) :-) - They let me teach essential oil classes every Saturday at this location so they are definitely into health and wellness!  Cons: - The noise level can be a little loud with the blender and smoothie going at times (hard to hear conversations) - Some food items could use a little more flavor like the hummus (but they are still tasty)  Final Verdict: - This is a must-visit location if you are a local or if you are visiting Las Vegas. This is one of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas and there's a reason why I go here every week (it's so awesome!) :-)",

I've been sick in bed so I ordered over the phone and had my boyfriend pick it up. I ordered the samurai burger platter, the raw cheesecake, and the castaway smoothie. The lady I spoke to made the cheesecake sound convincing and mentioned that there is fresh fruit on top. My boyfriend brought me the food and there was no smoothie. I ate the burger and it was actually delicious. I don't eat red meat anymore so it was nice to have an alternative. It came with fries that were soggy, and a bit oily. I open the box of raw cheesecake and it seems melted and had no fresh fruit on it. I ate it anyways, and to my surprise, it was really yummy. I called to complain about the service and also mention that the food was really good (lol) while my boyfriend went to grab my smoothie. When he came back he told me that they made it fresh so I take a sip and it isn't very cold. It was closer to room temperature but the flavor was good. I just wish it was cold. They gave him a 10% off card for next time which was a nice gesture, but the service needs to be improved. I do have to say that they have a lot of potential considering that the food is delicious but they just need more accurate service even for to go orders. I want to go here again, but I just hope the service is better next time.",

However the service is hit or miss depending on who is working and the food is the same sometimes good sometimes the complete opposite. I keep coming because of convenience but other wise I would spend my money else where. Today I came in to order an $7.95 shake only to recieve a child's size cup of something that didn't taste nor was it the size I usually recieve when I ask the server if the sizes changed she rudely hands me the menu and tells me to reference the sizes. I'm in here everyday and still no one has asked my name and they act like they've never seen me before. I would suggest finding another place in vegas to spend your money. I'm going to hunt for better service and better quality even if I have to drive further.",

It seems they aren't staffed enough for the amount of guests in the restaurant at any given time. That being said, the restaurant isn't even half full, but the servers take a while to get to your table and the food takes no less than 30 min to come out. This was my second time here. I will definitely be back, just don't have any prior commitments you have to be at near the time you come.",

    "text": "I wanted a healthy meal. Choices are limited. You know, let me try Violettes again. Perhaps they have ironed out some or all of the issues, I previously reported. I am happy to write that my first trip back in quite some time, was a big success. As usual, you are greeted by one of the cheerful staff. I then checked out the new, updated menu. Glad to see my favorite lentil burger remained.. A delicious bite that exudes health. The bean/corn salad remains tasty. I could eat a gallon. I had a simple salad with a chipotle lime dressing. Like all the ingredients here, the salad has the freshest of ingredients. Lettuce has that lovely crispiness that makes it good. The dressing has a kick. I mean that in a good way. There were perhaps a few too many chick peas for my taste. The coconut cake was ok, the everything cookie outstanding. Make sure you get their apple pie, which is the best tasting dish on the menu and among the best pieces of pie, I have EVER eaten. Many of my complaints from a prior review were fixed. I did not order any juice, but I can tell you, I saw to go covers. I am optimistic about my next visit. Healthy meals make for a better day. Violettes is a go to place to do just that. Like many new businesses, kinks need to be ironed out.  Violettes has done just that. I strongly recommend you give it a try, whether you are vegan or not.",

    "text": "worse service EVER ! Gave me a dirty cup with no straw , had to get up and ask for it . Asked the server what was good on the menu and she said she doesn't know and hasn't tried anything . We ordered smoothies to start and after 20 minutes server walks up to say they dont have one of the ingredients to make it . After 10 minutes comes up to let me know they don't have the juice for my smoothie . After another long wait , our food comes out . They did not bring any silverware or napkins . Waited a couple minutes and then just got up and asked for some myself . Were not asked if we wanted ketchup or anything with our fries and were not checked on again . Had a friend join in and she asked for hot coffee . Server says okay and goes to the back and then walks up after 5 minutes and says they only serve cold coffee . My friend agrees to the cold coffee and was just waiting . Around another 5 minutes pass and our server comes back to tell us the coffee machine is broken . Both servers working looked miserable and did not smile once , and one server looked to have poor hygiene so you're almost scared if she gets too close to your food . Overall , this lunch experience was 2 hours long for one sandwich and two smoothies . So if you plan on going in , eat right before you do because by the time it all comes out , it's time for your next meal in the day . As for the food , i couldn't complain . It's the service that i dont plan on going back for",

We make a point of visiting local vegan when we travel and yesterday we drove to Vegas for an event and decided to check out the local vegan joints.  Violette's had solid reviews on HappyC, and my family (4) went for dinner Friday night.  The cheeseburger was the best homemade veggie burger not anything like a Boca or Beyond Burger.  The fries were THE BEST golden brown ohhh I'm relieving the taste!!!! Let me go on...the steak seitan and broccoli mashed potatoes and mushrooms and gravy. The portions were large and good value. My kids are kind of picky and they both commented how good the food was (rarely stated like that).  Then we went back the next day for lunch before heading out of town.  Ohhhj I'm Getting flashbacks about the lunch.  I had to tell the staff several times how great everything was.  They were all very attentive and mellow with focus on the job unlike many of my home restaurants in Orange Cty. . Honestly is it okay to say we had food orgasms at Violette's ????!!! We did!!! Thank You!! I'm not sorry to say Violette's would be a major reason for us to go to Vegas for more than the Strip.",

    "text": "Finally got to try this place out for a Saturday lunch! My bf & I have been on the hunt for some good vegan-friendly restaurants. This is definitely now on our list of favorite vegan places in Vegas!   It's a \"seat yourself\" type of restaurant and our server told us about the breakfast and brunch menu since it was our first time. We each got a free coffee when you purchase an entree (love how they serve fresh \"Desert Wind Coffee Roasters\" & support local business since that's my favorite coffee shop in town!) which comes with almond milk and brown sugar as the sweetener.  As our appetizer, we checked in to get a free Red Rockin Chili - which was great and tasted like regular chili! It comes in a huge bowl which was good enough for us to share.   For our entrees, we decided to go with the Hippie Chick Burger with a side of French fries and the make your own tofu scramble with tempeh bacon, brown rice, and a side of pancakes.   OH MAN. The burger was super tasty and probably the best vegan burger I've had so far! I think what really brought out the flavors was the pesto that was in it - so yummy and a serious must try! 5/5 for sure!   My bf really enjoyed the tofu scramble because the tempeh bacon was DELICIOUS! It was so flavorful and even better than regular bacon. 5/5 as well!   We were so full but decided to get the vegan donuts to go; they have a little display of their vegan desserts and they all looked delicious! Definitely looking forward to trying those for next time.  Overall we had a great first time experience and though it is a bit pricey, we can't wait for the next time we go!   Even if you aren't vegan, we truly recommend to try this place out in the future!",

    "text": "3 1/2 stars, really. Potato Salad.  Potato Salad. POTATO SALAD! This is my way of expressing just how much I LOVE their potato salad, which made me give them 4 stars instead of 3. Coming from Missouri, which has very \"southern\" roots and ways, I love a creamy, mayo-based potato salad, but had not been able to find a good one since becoming vegan.  The search is over. As I ate my potato salad in my car, I contemplated going back to ask for the rest of their pot, tupperware bowl, etc. I need this in bulk! (They should sell it at Sam's or Costco!) Moving on...  I also got 2 orders of the Sassy Wings, but one order was buffalo sauce only. While the flavor of the sauce was very good, I wasn't a huge fan of the texture of their wings; they were too thick.  I prefer a thinner, less \"faux-meaty\" consistency. They were just ok, to me.  I ordered a side of their Fabulous Fries, which were excellent in flavor/seasoning.    I also got their Country Classic, which, per the menu, comes with crispy tempeh & tofu cutlets (1 of each), collard greens,mashed potatoes, and cornbread. Sounds like a proper southern meal. However, to my dismay, I ended up with a cauliflower, broccoli, and carrot medley instead of the promised greens. (I had hot sauce in my bag for those greens!) I didn't like the cornbread or the cutlets. I was disappointed, to say the least. The mashed potatoes were good though.   The carrot cake that I ordered was delicious.  I was supposed to get a free Red Rockin' Chili with my Yelp check-in, and she even marked it as \"Used\" on my app, however, it was MIA from my to-go bag.   I may not have had the best experience with all of the food I ordered, but I still really like this place. The vibe was mellow, light auras, friendly worker, clean and welcoming environment, and the prices are fair. It's in a strip mall, so there is plenty of parking, and there is signage everywhere... On each corner for each intersecting street and on the front and back of the building, which was extremely helpful for me as I was looking for it. I will be back to try other menu items, and of course, for more tater salad.",

I had a wheat gluten meatball sub which was delicious but it kept me bloated for about 4 days. But again I didn't know that I was gluten intolerant until that day. But that didn't deter me, I've been back four other times, each time I have avoided gluten. I've had tofu dishes, tempeh, etc and everything has been super delicious. The veggie mac and cheese is amazing, you'd be surprised to know that there was no milk. The buffalo chicken sandwich which is fried tofu with buffalo sauce and all the fixings is delicious. The Orange juice is amazing and I just had their tofu scramble for brunch this morning and I was quite impressed. I'm new to this whole vegan thing and I guess my point is to be careful what you eat if you're just starting out because you don't want what happened to me to happen to you. The great thing is that they have amazing options and everything has been delicious. It's a little bit pricey but you would expect that for high quality food and organic ingredients.",

Their menu is out of this world and use organic WHENEVER possible.   Their juices are the best juices in town. I have tried other places but by far this is the best one.   Their hours are also perfect! Opens at 7AM and you get free coffee with your breakfast!  Vibe A+ Customer Service A+ Food A+ Location A+ Hours A+ Kid Friendly A+ Healthy A+",

Great parking, and a lot of space for larger parties (6 or more people).   The night we went, they had live music and had the lights going outside for some great ambiance.   Beyond that, and what you're really here for, the food...  The food was really, really good. I was a little worried at first because my wife and I prefer restaurants that specialize in a certain genre. However, everything we ordered was very tasty. My son loved his food too.   We shared a buffalo cauliflower as the app, very great flavor and sauce. For our main entrees we both had salads, they were huge, so beware if you're considering one. I will say, the caesar salad was a little underwhelming, nothing spectacular and definitely nothing I would order again. My son had the kids Mac n Cheese. That was very tasty, and something I would order again lol.   The only knock, besides the salad, was the service. Our server was nice, but they were under staffed so things took a while. It's hard to have patience though with an unpredictable toddler.   All in all, I would definitely come here again, no question.",

    "text": "Quintessential Vegan Superpower For Your Clean-Mean-Alkalinized Lifestyle and the DADs (Days After Debauchery) ****Excellent in my non-professional opinion, for gluten-free, grain-free, Low-FODMAP and macrobiotic adherents, for those with various intolerances and allergies and compromised health****  Thanks to fellow Yelpaholics, I had lunch here with family members while we were on a sedate vacay around New Year's 2018. I'll bet you $100 I'll come back the next time I'm in Vegas, and every time thereafter, even more so than the foodie destinations here most popular with the masses.  Atmosphere:  Casual, phenomenally positive vibes from the plant-based sustenance. Pretty pastel colors on the walls, embrace-the-sexiness-within-you posters and wall decor, soul-boosting books from various cultures and blended faiths to peruse and delight and get you on your way to a most pleasant day. Clean, bright, airy, cheerful, no guilt, cruelty-free! More on the books and other: Earth-embracing, female strength, human solidarity, no-more-wars ever grooviness, yet not too idealistic, for your supreme higher self!!! The friendliest, genuinely radiant and helpful staff who really seem to love being here and serving you. It sounds like I'm crazy-high on life writing this, and I am.   Food:  Just a few standouts were the perfectly crispy and damnnn, so flavorful cauliflower with the unusually seasoned Teriyaki sauce. You have to get this!! My wheatgrass was obviously made with grass blades plucked at the ideal time for juicing, as just by the taste, this was better than most wheatgrass shots I've ever had. A bit of liver-lovin' bitterness cut with a hug-you sweetness. I believe it was the non-soy (I TOTally avoid soy products unless they are fermented, for optimum thyroid, hormone, immune system, and gut functioning; plus 90% or more of U.S. soy is GMO) burger I ordered. I didn't miss the meat one bit and probably, neither will even many die-hard carnivores. This burger was of a far higher quality than 80% of burgers I eat, unless I make them at home using only the healthiest meats available. Juicy juicy, well-spiced, bursting with sprouts and other vegetables, delish bun. Thick, chunky, gimme-more soup of the day. My dining companions quietly feasted contentedly on all their food. No complaints. And no gas afterward. One thing to note: The orange juice ordered by one us tasted like it had kale and/or other unexpected produce in it. They happily made another one for the table, without prompting. If you want a juice that doesn't taste faintly or more overtly of previous juiced orders, say so upfront so they can maybe run water through the juicer or otherwise take care of your request.   Prices: Less than what you'll pay in the tourist-infested areas of L.V. Reasonable, quite.  Misc: Clean, cheerful restroom. Large booths. Sufficient space between tables. A little bookcase filled with books for kids and adults, sits in the back. Good acoustics; you don't have to shout. Calm, well-behaved peeps visiting this place. In a shopping center. Parking looks like it could get scarce at peak times.   None of us were truly hungry for dessert or anything for quite some time after our meal. No extra caffeine needed. Low-glycemic-index foods with uber-dense kernels of nutrition will do that for you. Flying high for the rest of the day. Seriously. But it was also the gym workout and meditation before breakfast.   Get yourself in here already!!! Family-friendly. You will feel the difference.  We were even lucky to meet and briefly chat with the owner, a smart, nice lady. Peace, ever more success, and expansion wishes to this restaurant dynamo!!!! Xxxooo :-)",

    "text": "I've had great experience here before. But yesterday, I ordered a Superfood Quinoa Salad and the black bean salad using their app and to be delivered. I hate to do this, but I'm not thrilled that I paid over $20 and wasn't happy with what I received with the exception of the black bean salad (it was delicious).   1) their website states that if you download the app, you get $5 off your order. Not True. I had to call twice and while the woman I spoke with was incredibly nice and attempted to accommodate me, the $5 code didn't work and I was unable to receive this discount despite the website offering the same. I was offered a free dessert as an accommodation, I declined.  2) I was told my salad wouldn't travel well unless the dressing was on the side (it's supposed to be tossed). I said that was fine, but ended up with not nearly enough dressing to toss myself.   3) My $14 salad was supposed to include the following items which were NOT included: mixed field greens (I got romaine instead), kale, avocado, raisins, and sunflower seeds. Instead I paid $14 for quinoa, romaine, cucumber, broccoli, carrots, cabbage, a few goji berries, walnuts, and sprouts with not nearly enough dressing.   I'm really disappointed. I will eat here again eventually I'm sure (due to the complete lack of vegan options near my office), but I won't order carry out. I feel like I was taken advantage of by being charged $14 for a crappy salad that I could have made myself for less than half that. I ordered the salad because I needed the nutrients and didn't want to spend a bunch of money on things that weren't healthy. Well... I got an awful salad that lacked more than half of the \"superfood\" ingredients advertised. I know more restaurants completely cheap out in avocado, but seriously? Not to include it at all? Then romaine? This salad sucked and I'm irritated.   However, their food is delicious when made properly. I would recommend eating there or picking up your order so you can verify it is correct before you leave. I would never order delivery from here again.",

    "text": "Finding vegan food can be a challenge. Finding creative, unique and tasty vegan food (other than a salad without meat/dairy or a plate of vegetables) is like Mission Impossible 7. Luckily, there are restaurants that hold higher standards and attempt to set the bar high.  When I left L.A., I left Follow Your Heart. It's not just a brand, it's a market/restaurant that was minutes from my home. It was my safe haven and a place I could enjoy and not fear cross contamination.   Alas, I moved to Las Vegas, only to discover vegetarianism and veganism is growing immensely! After a vegan search on Yelp, I discovered Violette's, and the extensive menu items enticed me so much that I have been back again and again.   Now that I have tried a few menu items, I can honestly say that I have \"followed my heart\" to Violette's. I love the variety of fresh, organic and delicious vegan food!  My current favorite is their \"mac and cheese\", teriyaki cauliflower bites, the chocolate cake (love the vanilla icing and would love to try a double chocolate if they ever switch it up) and zucchini zen sticks because that marinara dipping sauce is what life is all about!   This is definitely my new go-to spot!",

They offer a wide range of dishes, from sandwiches to full entrees, and also have a fresh juice bar! The first time I came here, I had the Violette's Club (double decker club sandwich made with tempeh instead of bacon, and tofu instead of turkey). Today I tried the Sunrise BLT (a BLT with tempeh instead of bacon and vegan mayo on grilled sourdough bread). Both are excellent.   Service is friendly, but do be prepared to wait a bit for your food. I think everything is made to order, so I wouldn't advise coming here if you're in a rush (but they do take-out as well!).   The decor in the restaurant is really cute and creative. I look forward to having lunch here again.",

We enjoyed it so much that we left on foot walked around, had a massage and went back again for dinner!  Grilled vegetables are usually just boring grilled vegetables, and as vegans we can tire of them. You have never have vegetables until you have had them here! Oh my! They came with the biscuits and gravy and I just could not believe how delicious they were!  The vibe here is awesome and the food and service are so good that thee wait is totally worth it...which is not nearly as long as some reviews make it seem. Y'all, there are outlets at every table. You have your very own outlet at your table!!!! So when you're ordering nonstop you can charge your device, so you can take pictures of your food!

I personally think things are more flavorful when made with a soy or plant based protein. Also their \"wings\" with buffalo sauce instead of BBQ is a great starter!

In fact they taste just as rich and delicious as regular biscuits and gravy and that is coming from a Southerner. The smoothies are also delicious. Grab a blueberry muffin smoothie. Deliciousness in creaminess form!  This place is the perfect blend of laid back one would expect from a casual vegan eatery. Comes complete with your choice of holistic literature for sale.

She was real friendly and frazzled juggling 5 other tables. We were surprised that the other woman behind the counter completely disappeared. We ordered our dishes to go and after 20 minutes, she went to the kitchen to find out what was taking so long (before the kitchen door shut, her shouting started).   Everything was packaged very neatly. We ordered Zucchini Zen Sticks, the Philly with French Fries, California Dreamin' Bacon Cheeze Burger with Mac N' Cheeze, and dessert. Mind you this is for two people heading back to Orange County; this is our road trip food to last us thru traffic.  We paid at the counter and the server kept apologizing for the wait. We were not in any hurry but she was kind to acknowledge the wait.   All the food was a delight. We only ate half of everything because we wanted to still have a nice treat of eating it again the next day.",

I would understand if I ordered an item that was made with more costly ingredients. Not terribly impressed",

I usually get my food to go because I have family that live nearby and I stop by to pick up some healthy vegan food before I am bombarded with junk food.  The smoothies are made fresh and to order. Some of the sweets are outsourced which is fine. I think it is great to promote other vegan businesses. The staff is friendly and do a good job of taking your order quickly and efficiently.  I even pre-ordered a full course meal last Thanksgiving to take with me and it was delicious!  The meals here keep me full and happy. I think even non vegans would enjoy the various breakfast and lunch menu items because they look like the 'real' thing without doing animals harm.",

Also you get a free soup with your check in!   The staff is always really friendly. They make great recommendations. The first time I got the bacon cheeseburger. I asked for no thousand Island sauce and it came with it anyways but it still tasted delicious so I wasn't too mad. The second time I got the temp a steak sandwich, which was so delicious but a little bit oily. Overall I would get either one again, but I would prefer to try all the items on the menu. Their fries are really good too. They are pretty soft which is what I prefer instead of crispy fries.  I still have yet to try any juices or smoothies, I will totally update this review the more food I try",

This sandwich does not include any sides, but it's a real steal at only $6.95. For $2.95 I added a side of breakfast potatoes and it included their homemade ketchup that is very tasty. I quickly realized that the sandwich alone was more than enough, but hey...I'm greedy.  My daughter ordered a 4 item combo meal for around $11 or $12. She picked chocolate chip pancakes, potatoes, a sausage patty, and the tofu scramble. The patty was just okay, but the vegan pancake was really really good.   On my next visit, I will explore their lunch menu.",

The service is pretty good... Lots of friendly smiles. Menus and water are always delivered in a timely manner and the food always comes out quickly.   The food... I've tried the hippie chick burger (flavorful and exceptional... One of my favorite vegan burgers ever)... The nachos (I'm not a nacho person but they were good and full of all the nacho fixens)... the zucchini sticks (definitely good and crunchy but I'm not a fried finger food person), the Mediterranean dinner (amazing! And had everything a girl in the mood for Greek could ask for), the raw wrap (my favorite thing ever! Pesto was on point!!) the salads (all super fresh and crispy and large for sharing)... The black bean salad (I wasn't expecting this to be as good as it was, but it was really great flavorful and savory!)... The buffalo French fries (okay so I had only 1 off my friends plate because if I had any more I knew I wouldn't be able to stop eating them!)   I believe they are currently in the works of getting a beer and wine license which is really exciting for me... I love wine.  They also offer a full smoothie bar... I've tried a few of them.. The blueberry is really good... Tastes like a blue berry muffin... And the coffee one is amazing... I bring my own protein and modify as needed.   Vegans and non vegans...

I have the worst PMS munchie cravings today so I got the nachos, which were a healthy version of traditional nachos and so I don't feel that bad. My server was Jessica. She was fast, friendly and was excited to tell me about the menu. The vibe in the cafe is pleasant too; lovely chi. I really wish this place was in Henderson but I will revisit when I'm over here. :-)   I love this place. I just got the gluten-free fiesta cauliflower and oh my God it is delicious. I will definitely be getting this next time I'm in the area. Please consider opening a location in Henderson, pretty please!",

I almost always order Mac n cheese when I eat out because I'm on a mission to find the best vegan Mac. And this might be it. So good. And the noodles were cooked to perfection. It's not easy to find good vegan Mac so let's just say I was ecstatic to randomly discover this place. I also got nachos. Holy nachos. So good. Every bite was pure deliciousness. Not everyone can do nachos right. They have The layering technique down to a science. The cheese to chip ratio on point. And they use the thicker chip so it doesn't turn soggy in 2 seconds. I'm glad I live on the other coast of the country otherwise I'd eat my way through the entire menu.   Oh. And the service was great. Bravo Violette",

Two of us shared the cupe of tomato garden soup (loads of veggies!), buffalo cauliflower (tasty but not crispy), the small nachos (cheese sauce was amazing!!), the Philly cheesesteak (good flavor, delicious chewy bread, but not much filling), and the peanut butter shake (checked all of the milkshake boxes). The best part was the chocolate chip cookie (it's HUGE!) - the highlight because we added ice cream and made it into an ice cream sandwich. AMAZING!!! The ice cream was so creamy and perfect, the cookie equally delicious.   Customer service was the best. Our waiter was friendly and so enthusiastic/knowledgeable about the food. Will go back again!",

It's a menu I intend to work my way through for each entry, juice & smoothie!   Tip #1: save your receipt and get $5 off your next Dine-in meal of $25.   Tip #2: sit at the bar and get the benefit of smelling fresh juices being prepared in front of you.   Life is too short for junk food; eat food that loves you back instead!   The servers are lovely, they make you feel welcome too.  Request to management: please add your juice, shots and smoothies to your Yelp Menu or your website menu so we can choose in advance. I understand somethings won't be available for the PostMates or GrubHub service, but none the less, juice foodies like me want to get my palette going by selecting in advance of my arrival for take out service.

We both went with the potatoes and they were so good! Definitely want to go back and try other dishes!  Forgot to mention that we also ordered dessert - chocolate brownie which was soo soo good!, chocolate chip cookie which my sister loved and ate most of, and a slice of carrot cake that I brought home for my husband. Too bad no donuts since those are mostly available on the weekends. Btw - the brownies don't photograph well but they are oh so yummy!",

I was expecting long noodles and they were short little ones, the sauce was a little thin, and the flavor wasn't all there. So sad because I was really looking forward to some cream pasta!  Sloppy Joe w/mashed potato side: Delish. Hunnie Bunnie liked the Sloppy Joe A LOT. And she loved the mashed potatoes. Super creamy!   Fried egg breakfast sandwich w/Mac n cheese side: So good. I kept seeing photos of the fried egg sandwich, and it just didn't look very pleasing to my eye. But it tastes great! Hunnie Bunnie really liked it too! The max n cheese is made with these giant pasta shells and the cheese is ooey gooey. I think the shells may have been slightly overcooked, but they were still good.   Hunnie Bunnie also ordered the Strawberry Rosie milkshake. It was SOOOOO good. They asked if she wanted Almond milk or coconut milk. Sooooo daaaaaaamn good.  See our Veganuary Mukbang here: <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2F5cJR-BPl4mE&s=7f5a0507456772709be750a3285e9e39f7065b7fabf3ab202df58d170568e67d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtu.be/5cJR-BPl4mE</a>  We also came here for Thanksgiving dinner. It was verrrrrry good, and filling, and plentiful! The only thing I would request is they have their full beverage menu available to order during their special dinners. But I would definitely come back here for Thanksgiving. And it's nice to see everyone who was dining there enjoying a plant based meal for the holiday!  Staff is all super nice, and friendly, and the decor at the restaurant is super cute.",

I'd heard such good things! I was not disappointed.   The restaurant is colorful and vibrant with art on the walls and bright colors. There are booths, tables and bar seating (where you can drool over the delicious looking desserts up close). We sat at a round table in the corner which gave me a good chance to look around and soak up the positive vibes this place has.   We started with an order of Thai fried cauliflower and I have been craving it ever since! The peanut sauce that it's served with is so good and the cauliflower is crisp and tasty without being too greasy. For my meal, I got the Mediterranean Feast which was HUGE. The rice was the only part I didn't love... it was too dry. But the falafel, pita, pickled cabbage, hummus, etc was all really good and flavorful. It was a really refreshing meal.   For dessert, we got a cupcake, a brownie and a donut to go. I only ate the brownie but it was so good. The donuts come from a vegan donut shop in town but I forget the name of it. My friend said both the cupcake and donut were delicious.   I'm planning to go back next week... I need more of that cauliflower in my life!",

I definitely prefer eating their food at their location vs. takeout, and I'll definitely be back for brunch again.   I got the Rise and Shine plate, and added a fruit cup (bananas, strawberries, and blueberries). It was delicious! It's a tofu scramble with potatoes and steamed vegetables (carrots, broccoli, and cauliflower), and buttered toast, and the fruit cup was fresh and quite hefty! My bf got the California Dreamin' burger -- he's a meat eater and inhaled it immediately! We also got the teriyaki cauliflower bites (yum!!), and blueberry pancakes as a side. The cauliflower bites were plentiful, and the texture was on point. Very flavorful, too! The pancakes were fluffy and filled with plump blueberries. They were delicious!   Everything was prepared and cooked splendidly, and we'll happily return to dine in! :)",

I liked it so much that I even went two times in a row. So far I've tried multiple freshly squeezed juices (sorry I honestly don't remember their names but the greener the better for me :) ), their zucchini sticks (to die for), the teriyaki cauliflower, quesadilla and a bowl. Everything exceeded my flavor expectations. Good job to the chef behind all these tasteful creations.",

Walking in, you'll feel the hippy vibe but don't expect the menu to be full of salads and juices. Rather, it's got comfort food. Incredible \"chicken\" soup just like grandma used to make. Perfectly spiced and seasoned.   The buffalo wings are not shy of size. They are amazingly crispy and have the perfect tangy buffalo sauce. They're the quintessential wings we've missed so much from those days we used to have real sports bar wings. The ranch is a thick buttermilk dip. The celery is crisp but slightly warm. I was in heaven.   The best part of the meal was not just the food, but how incredibly nice the staff is. I was blown away with how nice my host was, I wish I could remember her name. I sat at the bar and saw that she was extremely busy but did not skip a beat to help me. I left feeling warm and happy about the experience. It's so rare these days that people are that kind.   *One note*: The buffalo wings did not take well to-go as a result of them being breaded. I wouldn't recommend getting them unless you are dining in or alternatively you can likely broil them to get them crispy again.",

    "text": "I've been to Violette's Vegan a few times and it's alright. Do I crave it? No. Is the food memorable? Nah. Is it on par with the amazing Vegan restaurants in LA or NYC or MIA? Heck to the no. Is there quality in the food? Yes!  Here's why I cut Violette's Vegan some slack. They're serving up ethically sourced, non-GMO, earth friendly food. Food that's semi-good for you (depending on what you order).   The menu consists mostly of soups, salads, sandwiches, wraps, quesadillas, and burgers. Plus a slew of overpriced juices/juice blends. I hate to say it, but Violette's Vegan is basically a conscious Applebee's, but with the exception that everything is made in house, non-GMO, and ethically sound. Why is there SO much bread at these vegan joints? I really hope the menu expands because what this place does/ what it's trying to accomplish (in my perspective) misses the mark. I hope the menu gets more creative, which is the energy that fills this space, rather than a humdrum of sticking to the boring vegan status quo. When I eat out, I don't want to feel like I could duplicate the same simplicity in my own kitchen. Where Violette's truly shines is in the soup department. Every single soup I've had here has been delicious (and yes, I order soup when it's 106 degrees out). Service is friendly, warm, and casual.  The space is bright and is a total hippie haven (not hipster, straight hippie). Although Violette's isn't my go-to, it's a great plan B because I know I can find quality, healthy options. There's a giant juice bar and book shelf which guests are invited to read while dining in house. They also have movie, guest speakers and featured menu nights.",

The food here really makes me think about going vegan as it was delicious and I see how a transition to becoming a vegan could be easier.   Next time I come here, I will try one of their juices or smoothies and I'll edit my review when that time comes.  Although I give this place 4 stars, I subtracted a whole star because I would love to see this establishment separate themselves from the majority of restaurants in the world and start providing Alkalized (alkaline ionized water), which is completely different from alkaline water, which has plentiful more health benefits!   And since they provide healthy food, they should provide healthy water too!   If you rinse produce with Alkalized water, it will remove the oil based pesticides off of produce (organic or gmo) and this will bring out the True flavors of your foods.  FYI:  Alkaline water stays alkaline for only up to 48 hours when bottled, so don't waste your money on alkaline bottled water.  It takes weeks if not months from factory to retail shelves.    DM if you'd like to know more about Alkalized water.",

    "text": "In Vegas for a vacation and I was hungry and did not have a ride for the day. Didn't feel like dealing with sketchy taxis so I went on yelp for places that deliver. Stumbled upon Violette's and realized I was definitely going to try this place out since vegan/vegetarian places are hard to come by on the east coast. The delivery service was great. I was able to just order online and everything came on time maybe even earlier. There was a $6.99 delivery fee, a small service fee, and driver tip included to the bill so keep that in mind if you want delivery.  Now on to the food!  I got the small sized nachos, the Teacher's Pet Kids Meal w/ tomato soup, a side order of mac&cheese, the blueberry cheesecake, and the Grateful Greens juice.  Nachos: it was very flavorful. You can't really go wrong with flavor of nachos even if it's vegan. The chips ended up getting soft but that was expected since I ordered it to go. It was no problem, just eat it with a fork like its a bowl from Chipotle! I asked for hot sauce on the side advised by a review I read on here. Turns out the hot sauce they gave were buffalo and sriracha. Both I would never eat with nachos but it was still good.  Teacher's Pet: this is the grilled cheese with a side of fries and green salad. I also got a side of tomato soup for my grilled cheese. The grilled cheese was the BEST grilled cheese I've ever had! It was everything I ever wanted in a grilled cheese. I know, I know \"relax it's just grilled cheese\". No it's perfect! The bread had the right amount of crispiness and butter and there was just enough cheese which was soooo good. It tasted great with the tomato soup but the tomato soup by itself was meh. Needs a little more herbs. The fries were not so great. It already got soggy by the time I opened the container. The salad was alright. Not sure what kind of dressing they put on it but it was very subtle which I liked. It kinda tasted like a creamy hummus.  Mac & cheese: I was pretty disappointed since so many reviews talked about how good this was. I thought because of how much I liked the nacho cheese and the grilled cheese, I would love this as well. I thought wrong. It was very very bland and I didn't taste much cheese. The croutons on top weren't soggy but they weren't crunchy. It tasted stale but it could just be from the contained heat it was in.  Cheesecake: not so sure how I feel with this one. I have always wanted to try vegan cheesecake and was excited to see they had some. But the recipes I would see online were not as wet as the one they sold. The crust was very gooey and sweet. Kinda like thick oatmeal. And the filling itself was just a bit too sweet as well. Agave is very powerful and a little goes a long way.  Green Juice: I love it. Then again I love all fresh juice. I don't like my juice to be super sweet which is why I opt out of getting the fruitier juices.  Overall I'm sure this place tastes a lot better if you were to dine in. I ate everything except for the mac&cheese and was very full but did not have that \"I hate myself\" feeling like if I were to eat nachos, grilled cheese, and cheesecake at a pub. The prices were pretty reasonable as well. Delivery just made it more expensive.",

I am a juicer and restaurant professional so any restaurant close to home is all mine ;)  Walked inn no hello or how are you? NOTHING. So went for a menu took a look sat down. NOTHING AGAIN. I have lived in this neighborhood for couple years and have seen restaurants close and open in the shopping center there in. I give them some time before they close. To many friendlier places to visit! And Selection at other places!",

    "text": "Let me start by saying I am NOT a vegan, but the opening of this restaurant intrigued me. I've been here a few of times since it's opened and their biggest flaws only seem to be that they are a new restaurant and need time to get things perfect.   I took my daughter with me both times (despite her saying that she really doesn't want Vegan food). She's too young to understand Vegan, and I think it's healthy for her to at least understand the different dietary preferences that strongly exist in our modern culture today.   The first time I went I ordered the Hippie Chick burger. I was a little shocked by how small it was BUT I was so full after I ate it, I was actually glad it wasn't bigger.  I ordered it with mashed potatoes which I wasn't sure I would love, but was pleasantly impressed by!  The gravy was perfectly seasoned and the mash was creamy. I also ordered the Beet Goes On juice. It was delicious!  My daughter ordered a pineapple mint juice but they were out of mint that day, so the server recommended another mixture: pineapple, orange and a little bit of ginger.  She LOVED it and drank it all. For her entree she ordered a kids burrito (No Meato Bandito) which was way too big and she said was very very boring. She packed it up to go but she didn't finish it at home either.   The next time we stopped in I brought my boyfriend who wasn't really hungry but really wanted a smoothie / fresh juice. He ordered 2 smoothies to try: Amazon Rocket Fuel and Green Lava.  I loved both of them.  Haven't found a disappointing drink selection on the menu yet. Hi-five!    For my entree I had the teriyaki tofu bowl (Love Bowl), which didn't taste anything like teriyaki to me.  It was still good, but not great.  I don't think I will order that dish again.  My daughter ordered the Spaghetti and Meatballs, which she said was good, but she hardly made a dent.  Their kids portion sizes are really big.  She took it home, but again didn't finish it.  I prefer kids portions to be just enough.  It's hard for them to eat leftovers when the rest of the family doesn't have left overs as well.  I stopped in for my 3rd try tonight. I was dining solo so I walked in the door and stood there for a minute before any of the staff noticed me. A girl behind the counter said \"hi...\" and I signaled at her that I was dining alone (party of 1). She nodded at me but left me there standing while the rest of the restaurant stared at me. Awkward!  She disappeared to the back for a minute and thought she was possibly going to find another staff member to help up front, but instead came out with 2 plates which she delivered to the table I was standing next to (still waiting to be seated). She dropped the food off to them, asked if they needed anything else, and then walked to the back again. After those 5 awkward minutes, I left. If a half full restaurant means I won't even be seated, I don't think I'll be waited on with any urgency.  I guess I'll be back again another time. For now, overall rating is a 3.5, with a heavy weighing on tonight's experience of not even being seated.",

All the veg essentials are on the menue from BBQ Seiten to tempeh bacon tofu burger.  Service was prompt and friendly.  I spotted a Ninja behind the bar where a vitamix or Blendtec normally resides.  I'm a blender freak so I didn't try the smoothies after spotting that.  I think this is going to be one of my new regular places.",

With that being said the food overall is one of the best vegan restaurants in the city. Service is a little lackluster as some people have suggested. One employee was super friendly, while the other acted like she was mad she had been at work for so long, it was 11:30am...the place opens at 11:00. Twice now it's taken them over 30 minutes from the time I got there to actually receive my pick up order. Food-5, service-2.",

They also take the time to answer any questions you may have. I love their smoothies! I have a sensitive system and this did not upset it at all.  Biscuits and gravy.... Yum! Their vegetables are always amazing, not over seasoned or over cooked. The kale chips, I love. First time having baclava, and I love it. One will satisfy your sweet tooth. I also tried the chocolate cake and gluten free brownie, I was in heaven. This wasn't all at one time, I have made a few trips.  If you love zucchini, you have to try their zucchini sticks! They come with sauce to dip in that's just perfect to top it off. Everything I stop in, I try something new.",

I've ALWAYS had to wait at least 45 minutes to an hour for my food to be ready. In the meantime, no water, nobody checks in or updates me on my order, just wait. I love the soups/chili and the Violette club sandwich. One of the waiters has her kids there while she works. They are super cute, but I noticed she constantly made sure they had their drinks refilled and appetizers which isn't a problem BUT she seemed to be more focused on them than the customers. I waited an HOUR, they could have at least offered me a drink! Maybe you just gotta know somebody to get good service...  Update: I've been in several times (both for takeout and dine-in) since my last review and the service was awesome!! Food was amazing as always and the breakfast menu looks really good, can't wait to try it.",

    "text": "I'm sorry, I REALLY wanted to love this place but it was a huge disappointment. I hope the owners are reading these reviews because I see that a lot of people mention the terrible service & I agree. My fiance is showing an interest in plant based food and I was excited to bring him here, but after we left he said he's never supporting this restaurant again. We were basically the only table in the restaurant because one other table was already paying and getting ready to leave, and the third table was the managers (or owners, not sure) having what looked like a meeting. We waited 12 minutes for the server to greet us. Mind you, he only came over because I flagged him down, and his greeting was a confused and awkward \"do you have a question about the menu?\" He was the only server so there's no way he thought someone else would greet us. Very strange. My fiance got the California Dreamin' burger and after having tried the gardein patty and the beast burger a few days prior, he was highly underwhelmed with this lackluster burger patty. We both liked the chili and my biscuits & gravy were pretty tasty, and that is the only reason I'm giving this place 2 stars instead of 1. When it was time to pay, we had to ask the hostess for our check & a to-go box because again, our server was nowhere to be found.   Las Vegas has way too many fantastic restaurant options with amazing service to have to settle for this. Please get your act together with the service, Violette's. My fiance was excited to try a vegan place and this was a horrible first impression. We will not be back, and we could have been loyal customers. As a vegan restaurant, you have to try twice as hard to excel because skeptical omnivores walk into your business everyday, and service this bad will surely overshadow the rest of the experience and turn them away.",

    "text": "A friend of mine and I decided to catch up at Violette's Vegan, and we had such a wonderful time.   We shared a side of the mac n' cheeze and each had different sandwiches for our meals, and we were both very pleased. I would easily satisfy my skeptical vegan friends with that mac n' cheeze for sure. They didn't bat an eye when I wanted to drink out of my own glass (because in the summer heat, I take my glass jar with me everywhere to avoid plastic melting into my cups and such), and they even refilled it for me (which probably doesn't sound that impressive, but lots of restaurants won't do it--so I rarely even ask--because it's considered uncool to bring in your own drink, not that my water cup is a different price from their water cup).   What's more, they didn't seem at all bothered that we hung out there for quite a while, which is vital to me in a restaurant because many of my friends are from Europe, where you would never be rushed out of a cafe. Lunch is SUPPOSED to take two hours!  But really, the vibe was amazing. Not only did we have a super satisfying lunch, but we were able to really enjoy our time there. The staff was super friendly and accommodating. I also noticed that the bathroom was super chic, and the decor around the cafe was energetically on point. I read some of the hangings and found a couple quote gems from the Dalai Lama, which was awesome.   I will definitely head back to try their fresh juices and raw menu now that I'm attempting a transition to 80/10/10 raw vegan. I'm super psyched that they even had the options.   ***NOTE: They might be good for breakfast, brunch, late night, and dessert, but I have no experience with this, so I didn't mark those boxes.",

I ordered the hippie chick burger because I've eaten black bean burgers in the past and enjoyed them. Also it's the safest thing to order at a vegan restaurant in my opinion.   HIPPIE CHICK BURGER- Delicious burger made with black beans, quinoa, and sunflower seeds. Served with crispy lettuce, tomato, alfalfa sprouts, hemp pesto and mayo on multi grain bun. $12.95   I did not enjoy that burger at all. It tasted like mint and cloves on top of my black bean burger. Every time I've eaten a black bean burger somewhere,  they top it with salsa and avocado; so these toppings were not the best combination. Maybe I should've asked for avocado and salsa instead of pesto but I didn't expect it to be that bad. My mom told me to send it back and order something else but we were pressed for time. Also, the blonde waitress forgot my blueberry iced tea,  but I just shrugged it off because there weren't any good beverage options, so I wasn't thrilled about the sound of blueberry iced tea anyway. My sister ordered the Philly and her husband ordered the shinto steak sandwich.  They didn't like their food either.   SHINTO STEAK SANDWICH Thin strips of tempeh marinated in teriyaki sauce and flame grilled over a bed of greens on a whole grain ciabatta with miso mayo dressing topped with napa cabbage, kale, avocado and bean sprouts  13.95  THE PHILLY Marinated grilled seitan, peppers and onions, smothered with mozzarella and cheddar cheeze on a whole grain hero 12.95",

I was visiting Las Vegas for a convention and was excited to see this place has options that are both gluten free and vegan. Looking at the online menu, it reads as though their nachos are all made gluten free. It also has a picture of some killer nachos. I decided this was going to be my first choice of restaurants to visit based on the online menu. When I went to the restaurant, their physical menu had a note that the nachos could be made gluten free but did not come that way. Turns out the gluten free nachos did not have the delicious liquidy nacho cheese sauce pictured on their website. They just use Daiya by itself for the gluten free version. Daiya doesn't melt well, and if I wanted nachos with Daiya, I could make them at home. I took a $20 uber over to this restaurant just to get those nachos because I was under the impression they were gluten free.  So, I decided to get my second choice, I forget the name but it's essentially buffalo wings. Turns out they were out of that menu item. At this point I honestly wanted to leave, but I was starving. I ordered breaded zucchini and decided to try them with ranch. The ranch dressing was solid like cream cheese and didn't have much taste, I have no idea how that is put onto a salad. The zucchini sticks themselves were really delicious, they were cooked perfectly. If they were all I had wanted and eaten I'd give five stars. But even the tomato dipping sauce was bland.  I'm mostly disappointed because I feel the online menu is misleading about which items are always gluten free vs can be prepared gluten free. If I had only looked at the online menu before ordering the nachos, I would have thought I was ordering gluten free, and I would have gotten very sick.",

On top of that she gave herself a $5 tip; my friend ended up paying $16 + a $5 tip when her meal only cost $10. The food was good but not worth the rip off again.",

The vibe at this place is totally welcoming, you'll feel it as soon as you walk in. There was definitely a lot of thought on the decoration of this place. I love it! You can also go for a juice, smoothie, or if you have a sweet tooth you can have a delicious brownie. It is comfortable just to hang out, while you drink your juice and work on your computer. The service is above and beyond, most of the times our server has been Sabrina, who is really attentive and cool. They also have a rewards kind of program, but once you go to this place you'll get hooked.",

    "text": "So, Violette's has stepped up their game.  I tried it out a few times within the first few months they were open, then again about 3 months ago, and was disappointed w/ the service and w/ inconsistent food quality.  I'm a member of a local vegan facebook group where a couple of months ago, there was a very long thread of many of us disappointed and wishing it was better.  I neglected to write a bad review at first because they were new, and because we do need more vegan options in the city - but at the same time we also shouldn't be sacrificing quality.  Well - I can't say anything for the service, because I haven't dined again, but in the past week I ordered delivery and take out and thoroughly enjoyed both.  Delivery Order - Philly Cheesteak w/ side of Chilly Cheese Fries.  This was really good.  I believe they use Seitan as the steak which was season nicely w/ the cheeze sauce, onions, & peppers on a fresh whole wheat roll.  The chilly cheese fries were also delicious, and the fries stood up to the cheese and chilly even with being in the car for a bit and in an enclosed container.  Take Out Order - Backyard BBQ, Chilly Cheese Fries (again), and a slice of chocolate cake (how could I resist?!  It was RIGHT there!)  I must have read the menu wrong, because I though the Backyard BBQ was BBQ Seitan w/ carmelized onions on a bed of greens (i.e. Salad) but it was actually a sandwich (with the same whole wheat roll from the philly), I believe it also had vegenaise on it.  It was quite tasty!  The fries again did not disappoint and neither did the cake.  I know some have complained about the slight price increase, but the food really is still quite reasonable and if the rising prices are accompanied by tastier and better quality food, I'm all for it.  Violette's - thanks for listening and upping your game.  I look forward to future visits.",

What I liked immediately was that there was plenty of tables and you can seat yourself, so you find what you like.  The decor and style of the place is very well done.  Almost transport you away from the beige-ness of Las Vegas and into a very urban and hip environment.  This makes the experience so much better.  The service - Very nice pleasant and informative.  The food -   a.  The French toast - Wow, fluffy and densely moist?  How can it be that it has almost a moist cake like filling but it is fluffy at the same time.  Tasty with butter and syrup.  I am not sure of the calorie content of this, but man, i enjoyed this!  b.  The Rise and Shine - Now this is the first time I have had tofu scrambled with veggies and it was amazing!  I really enjoyed it and the flavor and the consistency was very good.  It came with sausage and home potatoes and I added tempeh bacon.  I am not a huge tempeh fan and wanted to try this.  c.  Organic Coffee that is local and also served with almond  milk.  Nice.    Overall, I was impressed with the taste, the quality, the size and the presentation of the food.  i will come back one day to try their all day menu as well!  GK says, check it out.",

    "text": "Based on what I ordered for my first visit to Violette's I thought it was just okay.  You can't really mess up a Thai Tofu Salad.  However, a cook shouldn't think JUST because it is a salad it can't be visual appealing and enticing to eat. A bed of romaine lettuce on a 8\" plate sparsely sprinkled with carrot shreds, bean sprouts, cucumbers, grape tomatoes, mushrooms and four finger length planks of tofu isn't what I would wow about.  It was preschool basic. For $12.95 I was expecting better. However, that is here nor there at this point.  I frequent another nonfood establishment in the same shopping center so I may have come in and tried something on their regular menu.  The reason I have decided to never return to this establishment is based on their expectation of what they want their customers to tip.   This is a casual cafe serving food at a short order cook skill level with minimal preparation, in an ultra casual setting and servers that are trained at a cafe service skill level.  It is far from a 5 star fine dining establishment with exceptional \"cuisine\", a multi-course chef tasting menu, wine pairings and several wait staff that dance with precision in a multi million dollar decorated restaurant. From the moment you step into a fine restaurant until you leave, the staff are ALL in sequence to offer a whole culinary experience.  I have dined at these fine dining restaurants and tipped 25%-30% on a hefty tab. It doesn't bother me a bit.  It is well, well worth it!   When I stepped into Violette's Cafe I got a good sense what to expect.  It's a casual cafe.  Service was below standard, if that's possible. We were a party of 5. The server did the basics; took our order, delivered our hot teas, delivered our food and gave us separate checks that we requested at the time of ordering.  During our little over one hour stay, she never asked any of us if we would like more hot water for our tea.  I had to request hot water and additionally through the meal another napkin.  Basically, she did nothing  outside of those three things and the service she did give us was below what I would consider good service anywhere else. In some cases, I have pardoned subpar service and didn't mind requesting refills because the restaurant was under staffed or busy. This Sunday, I was in at 12:00 and they had ample staff and the restaurant was not at full capacity. Based on my service experience, I was going to leave a little under 15% tip. it wasn't worthy of 18% which I usually tip on good service at a casual restaurant for a day time meal.  I have never experienced 'STICKER SHOCK\" in a restaurant.  When I was presented with my bill an \"auto gratuity\" of $3.74 on a $14.95 lunch tab (salad + hot tea) was added. Below the total, there were three suggested amounts for tips.  15%=2.25, 20%=2.99, 25%=3.74 however, there was no tip line to add our choice. The total automatically reflected a 25% gratuity tip on each of our lunch bills.   There are so many wrongs to this..... Our party of 5 were never told of the automatic 25% gratuity when she gave us our checks,  upon looking at the menu photos on YELP I don't see anywhere that it is printed on the BRUNCH menu we were given, this is a cafe, not the type of restaurant I mentioned above where I would have gladly tipped 30% on a EXCEPTIONAL $$$$ meal, we received subpar service and the food was just okay.  This is the first restaurant I've seen auto gratuity for groups of 5 or more.  Patrons are accustomed to seeing 6 and 8 or more on restaurant menus that are far beyond Violette's food quality and service standards and are only requesting the least, 18%.  I was appalled that this server had the nerve to present us with a ridiculous bill based on the service she gave us.  I calculated that she received a $17.00 tip from our group by not even doing her job description. The tip amount is a choice your customers have. If you are implementing an automatic tip for groups of 5 or more and the customers don't have a choice, wow, how much easier is it on the server.  Good service she gets $17.  Bad service she gets $17. She doesn't have to work to get a great tip.  It's guaranteed to her.  What does she have to strive for?  Nothing. Who ultimately pays the price?   I posted the apparent reasons of my dismay to their tipping policies and why I won't return. What was left unsaid, speaks louder.  UPDATE: By the end of day, I received a response to my YELP review from the owner of the cafe, Cyndy Violette.  She was very apologetic and sincerely concerned of my experience that day.  This shows she cares for her customers.  When I am in the area I'll gladly give Violette's another try.",

Burrito was once abundantly filled with beans, rice, onion, tomatoes, avocado, vegan cheese and spices. A favorite. Tonight's was filled with a white sticky rice mush, no onion, no cheese, no avocado and about six beans.  It contained square cubes of squash stuffed inside.   Ate about four bites then tossed it away. The restaurant has always been overpriced. Too pricey to be disappointed.  Other Vegan restaurants in town are far superior.

With the colorful art on the walls and Peter Tosh playing in the background, I feel like I'm back on the coast, not in the middle of the desert.  The food is creative, fresh, 100% vegan, and so delicious! (My mouth is actually watering just thinking about it.) We go a little overboard when we come here, but I regret nothing.  You can't go wrong with anything on their breakfast menu. I always go for the build-your-own option so I can have a little of everything.  Here are my favorite lunch menu items:  - Red Rockin' Chili Cheeze Fries (I have never had \"real\" chili, but my boyfriend thinks this vegan chili is BETTER than real chili. It is amazing.)  - Shinto Steak Sandwich / Potato Salad (Tempeh marinated in teriyaki sauce, with miso mayo, greens, avocado, and bean sprouts on ciabatta. Unbelievable. The textures are so satisfying and I've never tasted a more flavorful sandwich in my life.)  - Violette's Mac 'N' Cheeze (Oven-baked with creamy chunks of delicious bread!)",

We were waiting for a little over half an our which was so ridiculous. We finally got our food, and my tacos were on a hard shell not a soft one and the amount of potatoes was literally enough for about three spoon fulls. My boyfiend didn't even end up getting the cheese he asked for. BUT THIS IS MY FAVORITE PART, out comes the girl with ONE, ONE, I repeat ONE, slice of bread with such little avocado, it was comical, I paid 6 dollars, for one piece of bread.

I ordered a fruit parfait and it tasted better than I was expecting. My server or waitress/hostess (I'm sorry I don't know the correct term) was Alma and she was so sweet. All the employees seems friendly and helpful. When I went to the women's restroom I was especially happy to see all the fairy decorations and that they had out complimentary toiletries like tampons and pads. That's honestly a HUGE deal to me because in my 23 years of life I've never seen this in a restaurant or cafe. I really feel like the owner cares about their cafe a lot and all the customers by the way everything is set up. When you sit down to eat here and just look around you can feel how much heart is out into this place. Oh, also there is a kids section! Kids table and toys so they can do their thing while parents and adults do theirs. Really, really amazing place. I'm so grateful for my experience here. Thank you.",

I read about their breakfasts and was craving pancakes, but my friend and I arrived just after 1:30 when breakfast service ends. When my friend told the server that I was visiting and was on a long cross country road trip, the server and kitchen kindly accommodated our request! We shared the blueberry pancakes and the hippie salad (loaded with veggies, beans, sprouts and tofu), and split. Excellent food and good people.",

    "text": "We eat at a lot of vegan restaurants, as my husband was told by his cardiologist that he must be vegan! His health has improved because of it. So, when on vacation I look for good vegan restaurants. I'm a firm believer in healthy can (and should) be tasty!  Many vegan restaurants are just okay. Violette's Vegan is quite delicious!!!  The ambience is nice - pleasant and very colorful. We came for dinner yesterday and ordered Sassy Wings (BBQ seitan)  and the nachos as appetizers. Both were good - especially loved the Sassy Wings!   The Yelp offer provides one free Red Rock chili - meaty with pinto and black beans - also good!  The entree ordered was The Godfather - spaghetti with meatballs served with salad and garlic bread to die for - small sourdough slices that were crusty and flavorful. Two pieces came with the order and my husband ordered four more to go!  My daughter and I ordered sides of Mac & cheese with breadcrumbs, French fries, mashed potatoes with gravy, and Southwestern bean and corn salad with red onion and a lime vinaigrette - tasty. I usually don't like vegan Mac & Cheese - this was good!  I got a few of my daughter's fries, spooned Red Rock Chili on it and ordered a side of their cheeze to recreate the chili cheeze fries on the menu - tasty!  I think Breakfast is only served on the weekend, so we were in luck. We had to come back for more, so made it our Father's Day Brunch location. We hit the jackpot in that they were giving Fathers half off their meal - too good!  Sassy Wings were part of the Brunch menu - yay!  We also got the Yelp offer of Red Rock chili and it was a huge bowl that came with corn bread. There were specific menu items as well as build your own breakfast choosing from 3,4, or 5 categories with accompanying prices. Offerings included Southwestern tofu scramble with black beans, corn, and cilantro, sausage link or patty, biscuit (definitely a homemade type - great!, and the strawberry jam was perfect - not too sweet), organic fruit (sliced strawberries, blueberries, and bananas), and home fried potatoes with onions. My daughter got the sausage muffin with cheeze and tofu - she loved it!  The only addition needed was salt, and it was so nice to see pink Himalayan salt (what I use at home) on the table - perfect!  Our dinner was what we consider normal cost for three. Today with 1/2 off was awesome - all that food for $30 including tax!  I tipped our waitress based on the actual cost of the food. Both waitresses on each day were really nice - Aurora and Sarah. Sorry we didn't meet the owner, who has an interesting story - first female poker champion!  Whenever we come to Vegas, we'll be back!",

The food is consistently great, and we enjoy our meals with the peace of mind knowing that the best quality ingredients went into making our food: natural, organic, fresh and local. You can taste the love and care in every bite! The space and the ambience are beautiful and relaxing, full of uplifting art and colors. Great books are thoughtfully provided to look through while you're waiting for your food, as well as other little touches that make Violette's a special, heartwarming place. My husband loves their Nachos and Burgers, and I can't even pick a favorite, because everything I tried is scrumptious and delicious in its own way and comes in good-size portions, but probably Blueberry Pancakes... and pasta with meatballs and garlic bread. There is really something for everyone in Violette's. The service is warm, friendly and down-to-earth. We are always satisfied on more than one level when we visit Violette's and are super grateful to have it in Vegas.",

    "text": "I decided to try it out for the first time on a Friday night.  I have never eaten at a completely vegan restaurant before, having just moved to Las Vegas recently, so I had no clue what to expect.  I'm usually the annoying guy at regular at regular restaurants trying to modify everything to my liking. So not having to interrogate the waitstaff, asking if something had any bits of bacon or if they saute it in butter and etc was certainly something I looked forward to.  Food:  I don't know how they make seitan and tofu taste so delicious, but it completely blew me away. The texture of the beef and broccoli I ordered was great, the vegetables tasted very fresh. It was served with a side of corn bread and a butter they obtained from heaven. It was that good!   It's a place you can bring your non-vegan friends to and i'm sure they will really enjoy the foods served here.   Atmosphere: Everything about the place is captivating, it looks great, the walls are painted with very vibrant colors, tied in with an intriguing decor. The service was very attentive. The people present were incredibly kind and just oozed of positivity. It just looked like everyone present was in such a happy mood, certainly a place I can become a regular at.   Performance: They had a live performance as well which just brought it all together, they had a young singer that was incredibly talented, it added to the already great vibe of the environment for sure. She seemed incredibly passionate about her craft and was also quite comical at times, making sure everyone was enjoying themselves.   Overall, I had a great time here, will come back for sure!",

FOOD - The chili is awesome, would definitely get it again, since it's filling and just the right amount of spice.  Nachos were kinda dry (the chips themselves) - dunno if there's any melted vegan cheese they could add?  Sassy Wings were good, just needs more celery to offset the heat, and they are a bit on the heavy side.   SERVICE - Server was so sweet and friendly.  Everyone working there is really nice.    PARKING - Readily available in lot.   OTHER - Wifi available if you need to work on laptop.  Has card games.  Kid friendly (has kid's menu).",

The menu has a lot to choose from so it took us a little bit to decide on foods.    We did order fresh juices and that took a while to get.  There was one girl working the front taking orders, running the register, serving all the tables and making the drinks which explained why our food was coming out before we got our drinks even though we orders the drinks long before the food.  All the food we ordered was amazing.  We had a curry bowl, the club, and two appetizers which were all fantastic.  We ended up taking food home and it was just as good the next day.  Other then the slow service in getting things going everything was great and this is a place we would go to again and recommend.  I know other reviews dos not have as great an experience but I say give them a little time and try them again.  A place that is Vegan with all the selections they have is hard to find in this town.  Everything is made to order so expect it to take some time, but understand you are paying for organic and quality.  I recommend this place and we will be back...",

My fiance, who is a fledging/newcomer vegan just said this place pushed him over the edge to full vegan, and will be coming here basically daily. Thank you, Violette's for existing.

    "text": "While a group of us were in town for the week, last month, one of the girls in our party is vegetarian,  so we decided to check out this place with great reviews.   There were four of us who came to eat, my boyfriend and I, brother's girlfriend and my uncle's girlfriend. I thought the food was wonderful, although I don't have anything to compare it to, as it was my first vegetarian/vegan meal. But what left a bad taste in my mouth was our server, honestly if we had a better server this place would have received a 5 star from me and I felt bad for leaving a 2 star because the food was so good, that I made it a 3 instead.  My brother's gf got the hottie chick burger with fries and violettes purple powder drink, she was super excited for her meal.  My uncle's gf got the make your own breakfast platter I believe, and asked our server if they had waffles and she said no. Moving along...  I ordered the sausage patty melt for breakfast and my BF was torn between two different entrees, but what made the ultimate decision was the fact that our server told him the Red Rock Nachos came with \"chilli\" which was what he was looking for.  As we waited for our food,  I was looking over the menu still to see what we were going to bring back to the hotel for my uncle and brother.  As I was reading more of the menu I saw that they indeed had waffles and pointed it out to the girls and we just all agreed maybe it just doesn't come as an option for the make your own, so maybe that's why our server said no. I was looking around the place to check out the decor, when I over heard a conversation between our waitress and another employee. \" hey what kind of milk did they want for the violette?\" \"Uhhh, soy.\" That's when I turned to my brother's gf, asking her if our server ever asked for her choice of milk.  She said \"no, why, I totally forgot to tell her.\" That's when I told her well she just made the decision of soy for you. When our server came back she asked her what type of milk was in her smoothie before she drank it and I kid you not our server responded with \" umm what kind of milk did you want?\" Uhh wtf.. who responds that way?! What if there was a nut allergy and she chose almond for her?! Why not just come back to the table and simply ask?  Our food came out, everything looked delicious, of course we took pictures. Lol  Our server came back to check on us and one of the girls said, \" can I please get some ketchup?\" \" it's already on your plate!\" We all looked at her plate and saw no magical ketchup appear. \"Umm I didn't get one\" \"okay, let me get it\".. uhh attitude much..   I then look  over to grab some of my BFs nachos and I see him picking at his nachos and flipping chips over, he was looking for said chilli... there was none.  We ate all of our food, we loved it!  We needed our server again so we could order to go orders, but she was preoccupied flirting with the gentleman to our left. Bending over the table with her butt out and her chest in his general visual vicinity, guess it was her mating call. Finally, she comes over, totally different demeanor than what the gentleman received, darn. My brothers gf asks for a repeat of her order and our server replies with \"you want another one?!\" With complete attitude.  Needless to say, our server needs a attitude check, some training, and some professionalism, or just get rid of her.",

It was just the perfect amount of cheese, had mine with mushrooms instead of peppers and it really hit the spot! Side of french fries was a generous amount, and were cooked to perfection. Salty and crispy on the outside and nice and soft on the inside. You guys got yourselfs a regular. I'm glad that the owner reached out last time. It made me think that they really care about  customer satisfaction and that was the reason I decided to try this place one more time!",

The $43 (for one person) I paid for a \"Thanksgiving dinner\" was an absolute joke. The food is mediocre at best and so ridiculously over priced. I am from Chicago where vegan food is standard, not half assed and overpriced. Honestly I wouldn't even mind paying the price if they put any effort into their food. I can't believe people rave about this place. If you genuinely think this is good vegan food, you are not well versed in vegan restaurants and I urge you to try different places in any other big city. This place is garbage and an embarrassment to the vegan community.",

If you are gluten-free and dairy- free use wisdom as its all over the menu. Also they only serve sweetened tea ?  Gave 3 stars as there is a great vibe and the green juice was also very good.",

We've been to Violette's a few times now and always try something new from the menu. We've been very happy with all the food we've been served so far. The atmosphere is fun and bright and includes beautiful pieces of artwork. The service our first couple times there left a little to be desired. The waitresses don't seem very observant which meant service was a tad slow overall. But we kind of expect that now, so we don't go if we're in a hurry.

I sat up at the bar for 15 minutes and didn't even get a hello. My friend convinced me to stay, so we did. We ordered two smoothies and mine came out first (10 minutes later) and my friends never came, so we cancelled her order. My smoothie was warm, which I found odd so that didn't taste too great either. The server apologized for it being understaffed, poor thing was literally doing everything. She was running the bar, serving the tables, and dealing with the register. She had no help, and the owner was there and didn't even assist her. I've never left a bad review before and I feel bad for doing so, but it was my first experience there and now I will probably never be back. I'm sorry.",

I had to ask if there was any kind of sauce to punch it up and was given sriracha, which helped somewhat, but still. I had the Texas hold'em quesadilla and my friend had the chef's special of lemon chicken over quinoa which was also super duper bland and flavorless. HIs Violette's Purple Power smoothie was not at all sweet and had a chalky unripe banana taste. I had wanted to order dessert but decided against it.

I walked in and noticed to go menus on a table close by the door so I started browsing at that; nobody came up to acknowledge me.  I went to the cashiers counter because I spotted a couple of cake stands there.  I browsed at those and there was a lady behind the counter who didn't say one word to me!!  She seemed busy with either paperwork or money, but she could have at least made eye contact and tell me that she would be right with me or something.  Not one word!!  I left, won't be coming back, that was a horrible first impression of this place!!!!",

I do wish they labeled how many calories are in each meal option though. I also wish they would get some EatPastry cookie dough and sell raw cookie dough balls. They could make soooooo much money off those!!! (Even though the desserts they have now are delicious). Anyways, just wanna thank them for making my transition to becoming a vegan that much easier! Ohhh a poker night/tournament would be fun as well.. I hear the owner is pretty good at poker ;)  PS don't be rude, tip them every time so this place stays open FOREVER! lol",

I sort of expect these prices at vegan places, but this place felt like a bad giant vegan stereotype. The decor aims for an affected Indian brothel. The service was friendly enough, but I felt it could have been more efficient if they would have just charged us once we ordered our smoothies (to go) as opposed to make us go back to the counter after we got them. Even the clientele was an obnoxious stereotype with a young woman sitting shoeless at the bar writing what I imagine was her newest ebook. Like, what happened to \"No shoes, no service\"? I often bring nonvegan friends with me to check out vegan establishments, but this place was just an embarrassment to the lifestyle. The people who work here deserve more than one star, but I won't be back.",

Neither of us would've ordered our meals again and due to the cost (which is a bit higher than a casual meal out), I would try one of the many other vegan restaurants in the area instead of trying this place again. I will say that the service was excellent and I appreciate their organic attempts. Would appreciate a few more eco-friendly options (e.g. no straws and compostable takeaway packaging).",

It took a while to come (server apologized for wait); the flavor was good and the serving size was filling (16 oz plus the granola).

    "text": "I'm new to vegetarianism/veganism so I don't have much to compare to, but why wouldn't I give 5-stars to a place where service, appetizer, meal, dessert, and drinks were all on point! The little spot has a calming quiet environment, met with friendly service with a smile.   I started with an appetizer of Bronson sticks, I believe it was baked Tempeh (similar to tofu, but harder in texture) with a special buffalo sauce- friggin delicious. Next I had a Natures Girl salad, be careful there is enough for two! I can't begin to tell you how satisfying this meal was, for me, it was the tamari roasted almonds and herb tofu that did it. You've probably read enough reviews to know you have to try a slice of chocolate fudge cake, yeah, I had it, but my fat butt also had to try the coconut-lemon cake. I regret getting two slices because holy-MOLY they don't just give you a \"slice\" it's more like 1/3 of the cake type of slice lol. Hands down, the chocolate cake was amazing- and I DONT EVEN LIKE CHOCOLATE (that much anyway).. I would have preferred the lemon cake to have a more robust lemon flavor but unfortunately the coconut stole the show.    Another little perk is Violette delivers! Funny enough I found out about this place from a meat-eater who loved it & recommended it to me.. Definitely returning for more delicious vegan treats!!",

But have tried food in the past that was vegan and almost tasted like the real thing. So I get helped from a woman name Andrea or something pronounced like that. At first she was nice. Then seemed to get annoyed that I was asking for suggestions about the food. She seemed like she had no suggestions. When I asked her what was the soup of the day. Her response was that it is 4:59 and we will be closing in a minute...  But it was the way she said it with a sigh and slight annoyed attitude. So I understand that it's new year's eve and people got places to go. But was not expecting that kind of reaction. So far not a great start to that place. I did leave and came back for a business card. I didnt want to make a scene. So I emailed Kareen, who is somewhat high in management, did not respond to my email. So disappointed in him/her and not excited about this place either. Never recommending this place. Unless someone wants to be treated differently",

This was the last place I stopped at during my trip to Vegas and it definitely put a perfect close to the trip.   Options, options, options! This is one thing that this place certainly has. I spent way more time that I should have contemplating which items I wanted to try the most. There were several tie breakers, but my husband and I decided to try The Philly, California Dreamin Bacon Cheeseburger, chilly cheese fries, Mac n cheese, Violette's Purple Power Smoothie, Tropical Sunrise smoothie, and maple iced coffee. We just endured 5 brutal days in Vegas and our bodies needed to recharge! This burger was just the right consistancy and was just the right texture. The toppings made it even more delicious. I've had some pretty amazing vegan burgers, but this one blew the rest out of the water. The philly tasted just like I remember Philly cheesesteak sandwiches but BETTER! How could anyone turn down marinated grilled seitan, peppers and onions, smothered with mozzarella and cheddar cheese. (ALL VEGAN, OF COURSE!) YUMM!   The space has a very cozy yet open concept. There are crystals, cool art, and other unique decor hanging/sitting around. I noticed that our table had a charging port so that you could get some work done while enjoying some bomb food. They even have couches and a bar like area.   Our server was so friendly! He made sure that we were always taken of despite almost every table being full. I enjoyed every aspect of this place!",

What was really awesome was the service and the attention we got. I mentioned I wasn't feeling well so the waitress recommended a \"shot\" I could take which consisted of wheat grass, turmeric, apple cider vinegar, and some other stuff I can't remember...it actually made me feel better!

My friends and I opted for something light and i'm a huge fan of Vegan cuisine.  It's light, flavorful, and I feel like a million bucks after.   We started off with the Nachos. Ah these were ok, but, sadly, were the highlight of the whole experience. They needed more things to make it moist, not enough guac/ It was a dry nacho.  Looking at other pictures, I noticed they used a nacho sauce and salsa.  Now, compare others with the one I got. Mine is just sad. I feel ripped off.   Next, we had the mac and cheese. We had to send it back because they gave us the end of their mac and cheese. You know the part where you bake a large pan and then ends get really hard and dry. Yup, that part was served to us and it was not good.  I actually like this part when it comes to lasagna, but not mac and cheese. We actually asked the server to exchange it because there is no way i'm paying for it. She was kind and replaced the order.  But again, flavor was lacking and it was still dry.   I was beginning to feel uncomfortable eating the food. Like as if it I was forced to eat this. The pad thai came out, and it resembled nothing like pad thai. There was no peanut flavor whatsoever. Actually, all we tasted was lemon. We had one bite each and called it quits.    We opted out of dessert bc why? Paid our check and left. If you're ever in San Diego, you have to try Native Foods. Large portions, priced well, excellent service, and food is AMAZING!",

    "text": "Never in a million years would I think that I would actually enjoy vegan food. I've been to vegan food places but that's only because some of my friends are vegan so I just tag along and order whatever sounds or looks good. My friend and I were just hanging out and we were trying to figure out a place to eat and offered a vegan option. He suggested to me Violette's and I asked him if it was any good as I'm not a big fan when it comes to vegan food and he told me that it's a really good place for breakfast / brunch. So we ended up going here and the place was packed outside and inside so that's a good sign. Upon entering there's a sign that tells you to seat yourself. Upon looking at the menu I was actually quite surprised how delicious the items sounded. I ordered the Violette's Rise N' Shine off the special section of the menu which really surprised me. It came with \"eggs,\" \"sausage,\" potatoes, broccoli, and cauliflower. We also ordered some nachos which came with black beans, guacamole, vegan cheese and vegan sour cream. Yes, you heard me right, vegan sour cream and vegan cheese. Never would I have thought that I would enjoy vegan food and would definitely come back. Only downside was that the staff was not attentive at all and took about 15 minutes just for a server to come to us.  Fun fact: check in and you get a free bowl of the soup of the day.  Also a cool fact: You get free coffee.  Overall I would never think I'd like vegan food and if you're contemplating on whether or not to try vegan food I'd say definitely give Violette's a chance as it is extremely good especially the nachos. I will definitely be coming back.",

The restaurant itself was very cute.   Lively bright colors and interesting art on the walls.   My friend (and my boyfriend) is a professional poker player so she was telling us to look at memorabilia on the way to the bathroom.   Very cute.   The staff is super friendly.  They seem to really care about their jobs and making you comfortable and happy.     The food was pretty good.   Very flavorful and very hearty portion sizes.  I took home like 4 plates.  There were some real hits (mac and cheese and the eggplant parmesan) and some misses (the tomato soup which tasted like straight marinara with canned veggies in it) but all in all very tasty.    Overall, although the menu doesn't excite me that much (not a fan of fried diner food) I would definitely come back so a nice meal.",

Their menu has a variety of different vegan dishes and they explain the dishes so a non-vegan can understand what certain things are. I liked their food overall; we got the sampler for an appetizer, the shinto steak with fries and the California dreamin' burger. Liked all the food, except not a fan of the fries. We ordered the blueberry milkshake and peanut one; they were both awful and over-priced( $8 and change each). To me a milkshake has ice cream and is a little sweet. I get that it's supposed to be  healthier, but it was bad. Overall a good hangout/chill place to go to for food (only).",

We had the sassy wings, the pad thai (tastes quite sweet and like peanuts... just a tip), and the el toro grande burrito. On a separate visit, we ordered the red rock nachos and the philly (philly cheesesteak). The second time around, I forgot to take pictures because I inhaled the food in like -6 seconds haha Overall, I found everything we ordered to be delicious. The portions are huge and incredibly filling.  This restaurant has certainly showed me amazing substitutions to meat and that one doesn't necessarily need to eat meat (all the time) to feel full or satisfied.  Service was friendly and quick as well.  I think I can contently sell my soul to this place.. I will be back soon :-)",

A very interesting food invention and delicious as well. That was my appetizer. Then I had the featured burger of the month of veganuary the Tiki Teriyaki burger. The burger has plantains, lettuce,tomato and a slice of pineapple smothered with teriyaki sauce. The burger comes with fries for a side. This was a very delicious and satisfying vegan burger. I recommend getting to Violette's before the month is over and try One as I believe it's only being served this month.     We sat out side on the pet friendly patio with our dogs. Inside it was a full packed house not one empty seat sure glad the outside had room for us. The hostess and our server were both very friendly, kind and helpful. I'll keep being a return customer.",

I have had their club sandwich, pancakes, breakfast scramble, mac n cheese. Everything is delicious and the owner and staff are so wonderful! I would recommend this restaurant to vegans and non-vegans alike!",

    "text": "Overall wonderful little place. Any problems or complaints are likely to be fixed by the caring owner.   I'm not vegan but I've had several different meals from here and have been pleased. Unique flavors and good texture compared to other vegan meals I've had over the years.   Service has always been very good, even from new employees and certainly the ones that have been there for years. Interactive and attentive bringing refills with smiles. Quick to answer questions and make sure everything is good. Very good staff.  Owner is a poker player like myself but we are not good friends (Twitter friends only lol) so this review is legit. Spoke with her a few times over the years and she was very nice and happy I tried her restaurant though. Good vibes from her and the team for sure .  They're adding more juice options soon to give regulars more variety but the menu is big with several things I wanna try still.   I'll be back for sure, thanks Violets Vegan!",

Recommended: - Vegan cheeseburger with French fries: tasty, a little drier than a normal cheeseburger but similar in taste with a great bun and veggies, fries were piping hot and had a nice crunch - Vegan pancakes: hot and fluffy, not too sweet at all and goes really well with the male syrup",

Stopped by Saturday around noon and the place was pretty quiet. No warm welcome in fact I had to ask about to go orders after standing in the wait to be seated area for a few minutes (looking like someone who's never been there before).   The sassy wings took some time to prepare which the cashier kept going to the back to check on them and giving me voluntary updates.  I couldn't wait until I got home so I opened them up in the car and omg....!!!! Friggin Delicious the BBQ flavor was amazing and totally not what expected. I highly recommend it if your in the neighborhood and looking for a great wing alternative.   Nearly $15 bucks including a side of fries and their yummy ketchup!!!

    "text": "Cute place but when you go from cooking all of your raw vegan food at home to eating this type of food, well it's a little rough on your stomach to say the least.   As excited as I was to use my Yelp check-in offer for a free cup of their house soup, the waitress says to us, \"We had a mushroom eggplant soup, it was SO delicious. But I'm sorry we're all out.\" You can imagine the look on my face, right?   My friend and I ordered the sassy wings and nachos (vegan junk food) although I'm sure they have much healthier options. When I asked the waitress what \"cheese\" they used for the nachos she said it was a Daiya but they add flour and other ingredients to make it like their own, which in my head all I heard was, \"extra empty calories.\" Also, the sassy wings are seitan (wheat gluten) so if you have a gluten sensitivity, stay away from those.  I guess I can talk about a few good things here since I feel like I've been whining like a baby who just dropped their bottle. The atmosphere is colorful, casual and relaxed. The service was good and we didn't have to wait long for our food.   Since we were already on a roll of being unhealthy vegans for a day, we continued by ordering dessert; vegan, gluten-free carrot cake. It hit the spot although it was a little dry (there I go again, talk about a Debbie downer lol).",

The food is always great and the people are nice but their service has been terrible every time I go. It takes ages for the food to be done, I've had other employees take parts of my order (like fries) and give it to someone else who hasn't been waiting as long. I recently order ahead to pick up my mean and someone who ordered in restaurant to go got his meal before me, mind you I didn't arrive at the restaurant until 25 ish minutes after I ordered and still received it after the other customer (they got a meal with a drink and I got an entree and fries). On top of that a lot of the employees just kinda hand out in a circle in the back. I get having down time when working in a restaurant, but to blatantly but loud and not interact with customers in favor of hanging out in the back while customers want something isn't cool.",

The Veggie scramble was flavorful and delicious, and paired nicely with the veggies I ordered on the side. The veggies were  not over cooked, which seems to happen a lot when they are steamed.  The Happy Home Pancakes were delicious and sent me home a happy camper! I ended up ordering the soup of the day and the cauliflower bites to eat for a later lunch! My service was amazing, and I definitely felt as though I was taken care of! Service was quick and friendly, and you get free coffee with your meal. I will definitely visit this place again next time I am in town!  The staff know their regular customers, calling them by their first names and knew their usual orders! I think their flavors were better than some other vegan restaurants I have been to on this trip! Great little food joint doing good things with good food!",

My friend Kenny and I shared a chili which was delicious and I ordered the Hippie Chick burger with potato salad. The potato salad was delicious and the server said they were going to be making their own in house mayo (vs. Just Mayo). The Hippie Burger was pretty good...I liked the beans and sprouts but I'm personally not a huge fan of quinoia.  My friend Kenny ordered the bacon cheeseburger (w/fries) which I actually liked better. It was loaded with yummy cheese and avocado.  If I still lived in Vegas, I would come back to order the smoothies and juices as people were coming in for them and they looked quite good!",

It was so filling and yummy, as My server informed Me, if meat alternatives aren't your favorite the Philly won't be for you. Though it taste like meat, the texture wasn't exact. Vegan potato salad was a first for Me today and I loved it. The fries were very good as well as the sauces, so many options for dipping. The tea was very good, naturally sweet but adding a little agave made it perfect. My boyfriend got a burrito, I forgot the exact name (it had a star), it was HUGE and smelled great, he devoured it. We will definitely be back!",

When we asked for the bill, she charged us for the tortilla we didn't order. She was nice, but not engaging, or apologetic for the poor service. I think it's faster and more satisfying to place a to-go order. It would be nice if the menu included nutritional information.",

I'm sure they used frozen seiten as it tasted like it absorbed the flavor of whatever else was in the freezer next to it. The cornbread was rock hard. The burger bun was so dry, it was probably two weeks old. The patty was awful too. The only edible item was the French fries and we were practically fighting over them.  The server with the dirty dreadlocks, forgot my iced tea, forgot my sugar, forgot to pick up the check after we put the credit card down. We just paid cash and bailed.   The decor was even worse with ugly dingy orange, brown, green, yellow patterns in the booths and then matching bar stools. It was a dirty hippie 70's sanctuary.    It's places like this that give vegan food a bad name.",

    "text": "We've been to Violette's 3 times now, each on a Sunday morning for breakfast, so this review is strictly based on this specific day and course.  Firstly, thank you so much for opening a vegan restaurant in Las Vegas, it's amazing to see so many options starting to open here in town.  But based on our experiences, I don't know that I'll be back again. To start, and this is strictly my personal style opinion, the restaurant decor is straight out of the 90's...earthy peace-loving theme, kind of hippie meets vegan feel. It doesn't feel modern at all, it feels like an old tired cafe.  Secondly, as far as breakfast goes, the food is just ok. I'd like to see them not use so many processed meat/cheese substitutes like Fieldroast sausage and Daiya, I could make this food at home better. I would also like to see a better side to some of the breakfast options other than steamed kale. I like kale but plain steamed kale isn't very appetizing or tasty in the morning, it's also not creative at all.  Third, and most important, every time we've visited they have been out of something. It's been muffins, mint, pineapple and tofu...Yes, tofu! They ran out of tofu scramble today! Which is really odd since there is a Vons in the plaza!  Lastly, the service is mediocre. Servers are friendly but unknowing of what items are currently not available, again there always seems to be something out of stock here. The preparation time it takes to make your food order is quite long. Is there only one person in the kitchen who is still trying to figure things out?  Again, I'm happy for a west side vegan restaurant but based on service and creativity, in both decor and food, I will most likely drive downtown for Sunday morning brunch from now on.",

The service was pretty bad and our server kept apologizing for things which just made the restaurant seem like it had a bunch of mess ups to start with. Also our food came with cheese when we asked for no cheese. I wouldn't suggest this place to really anyone unless you like bad service and okay food :)",

First, the gentleman who was our server was very nice and helpful. He informed us of the the most popular dishes and answered any questions about ingredients we had never heard of. I had The Philly sandwich and my friend has The Godfather, which was a spaghetti and \"meatballs\" kind of dish. We were blown away by the flavor and consistency of both! Impeccable seasoning and good sized portions. We will definitely be back to try more things on the menu!",

The \"meat\" even had a smokey taste to it! And though the portion wasnt very big it was still pretty filling (and i can eat a lot) the side potate salad was nothing out of this world but still good. Also got an order of Sassy wings but didnt get to enjoy them much becuase they had a bit of a kick to them. For dessert we had the coconut cake which we didnt finish either, not because it wasnt good but because of how full we were (The slice is pretty big). The staff was very friendly, including the owner. The reason for just 4 stars is that the starters took long and about 20 mins more for the food even though the place was pretty empty.",

    "text": "As a vegetarian, I am used to having maybe one or two (three, TOPS) items to choose from at restaurants. So, going into Violette's Vegan Organic Eatery and Juice Bar was overwhelming in the best of ways. I felt like a kid in a candy store! I've been to Violette's twice, and have had the privilege to mooch off all my dining mates' plates both times. As such, I've sampled quite a bit from their menu. Some things are hits! Others--- eh, not so much. Here are my thoughts:  **STARTERS** -Wild Buffalo Sticks: Coated in a nice sauce! Reminds me of Frank's RedHot Sauce, my favorite. A must-have. -Mediterranean Hummus Platter: Fine, but a bit on the thin side. (I like mine thicker.) I expected the pita bread it came with to be warmed up, but alas it was cold. Still worth trying, as it all comes down to personal preference.  -Grateful Greens Juice: I am not super into juicing, but decided to try this just because! Alas, I can't say I was a fan, but it might be my fault. I was expecting it to be served cold and less thick. Also, the celery was pretty over-powering. Nay.  **ENTREES** -Violette's Southern Comfort: I wasn't a huge fan of the mac and cheeze. As a vegetarian who still consumes dairy, I find I'm super picky with vegan cheeses. While creamy, the cheeze was rather bland. I loved the crispy tempeh wedges, which reminded me of a vegetarian friendly fried chicken. I added a delicious baked yam to the side to complete my soul food comfort meal, and it was divine. However, I probably wouldn't order this again due to the mac and cheeze being lackluster. -The Hungry Man: My Dad, who hates everything he ever orders at any restaurant, got this combo of faux meats, gravy, and mashed potatoes and he LOVED it (as did I). It was hearty and flavorful--- the kind of meal you want to order on a cold day. I would order this a million times over. -El Toro Grande: A friend ordered this and I snuck a bite of the burrito \"butt.\" I thought maybe I didn't get to savor in the flavor because I only had tortilla and enchilada sauce, but my friend reported it was bland over all. The menu reports it comes with steamed veggies, but hers did not. (They didn't appear to be in the burrito, nor the side. Not sure what the scoop is with that one.) -Samurai Burger: My sister got this Asian themed burger. I sampled the patty, which was firm and had a nice texture. Be warned it's served on a pita bread type bun, and somewhat difficult to eat. Definitely use your fork and knife and devour as a tasty open-faced sandwich. -Mama Mia: Delicious eggplant, pasta, bread, and greens. The serving was ginormous! I was only able to try a few bites of this one, but I would probably order it for myself next time. The marinara sauce was especially delicious. -Taco Trio Love Bowl: Consisting of three hard-shelled tacos, each one with different fillings, the Taco Trio provided a nice variety! The cheeze on it had a hummus-like consistency that worked great with the meal. It also included rice and a salad. Very good!  **DESSERTS** -Triple Chocolate Cake: The moistest chocolate cake, ever. Their menu is not lying. Everyone needs to order this cake. -Totally Rawesome Cheeze Cake: Not too sweet, this grainy dessert was strangely satisfying. It's supposed to come your choice of fruit toppings, but they didn't have fresh fruit when we visited. No bother, it was good as-is! -Heavenly Chocolate Mousse Pie: Simple mousse pie. Like pudding and crushed graham crackers. It was fine, but I don't know if I'd order it again, because the Triple Chocolate Cake is 579573 x's better.  **SERVICE** -The service was fine, with all the staff being polite and professional. However, since I visited twice within the first week of so they opened, I could tell they were still trying to get into the swing of things (it took the servers awhile to enter the meals in the computer, long waits between ordering and food arrival, etc.). -I do have to commend the server I saw the 2nd time I went. I wish I had got her name! In addition to being a vegetarian, my mom is allergic to eggs and nuts. She was particularly worried because some of the cheezes contain cashews, etc. The server took the time to talk to the chefs to make sure the meal was suited for my mom. Great customer service! -I noticed the owner was present, and even brought out some of our food! I only know she's the owner from the FB page. I thought it was great that she was working alongside her staff. She definitely led by example. Nice work!  **COMMENTS** One last word to the wise: their Yelp page lists some hours, their Facebook page others. At this point, I'm unsure if they're open for breakfast/lunch, or just dinner at 5:00 pm. They also closed for a random day last week. I recommend calling ahead to ensure they're open before you stop by! My sister went back for a subsequent visit, and was sad to find their doors closed, even though it was during their listed hours of operation. We'll DEFINITELY have to try again another time!",

Checked in with yelp and got my free bowl of chili which was huge, hearty, and delicious! That was a meal itself.   THe blueberry hibiscus tea was refreshing and I like the fact that it wasn't sweetened. No artificial sweeteners, they had agave. Excellent!  I ordered the Texas BBQ sandwich and it was so juicy and hearty. The helpings are very generous. Had the fries and they are pretty good.   My friend had the teriyaki bowl with seitan and I have to say that was even better than my meal! Very generous portion on this also. We ended up taking half our lunches home.   Lastly I ordered a carrot cake to go and got home and it's, of course, awesome. Was looking forward to the coconut lemon cake but they were all out. Next time I'll have to call ahead to ask them to save a piece as I hear it's the best.   I sat myself and within a couple minutes was greeted and had my tea. My waitress, the blonde with the dreads, was so sweet and attentive. She explained many of the different products to us and gave some recommendations for some of the dishes on the menu. The restaurant had a steady customer base the entire time and from what I witnessed the service was great across the board. This is a definite recommendation and I will be a returning customer. I like that we were welcomed and all the dishes were explained to us.",

Some go to's for me are the sassy wings (seitan wings tossed in a BBQ sauce with a said if celery and ranch), the Mac and cheese, the hippie chick burger (quinoa and black been patty with a bomb hemp pesto, LoVe it in a collard green wrap..), and the carrot cake or baklava are both incredible.  They also have a fresh pressed juice bar and smoothies and power shots.  A little bit of everything for everyone.  Super family friendly and casual.  My daughter requests we go here all the time.  Definitely give it a shot!",

She was very on point with asking if I needed anything , taking my order , and getting me a to go cup for my smoothie .   I ordered the violette's club based on a review I saw and the violette's purple shake . Both were good but nothing special . Very clean and healthy which I appreciate . The sandwich either needed more salt , or pesto because unfortunately I couldn't taste the pesto :(   I want to try their Mac and cheese but didn't want to over do it . I'll leave it for next time ;)",

This 2nd time back I ordered the burger with potatoe salad and zucchini sticks. Both were delicious and the potato salad was bomb. The manager was super awesome and makes the best smoothies!

The set up is that you walk in and seat yourself but I noticed that 4 sets of customers were never acknowledged after sitting for a while, one girl was raising her hand like in class lol!! So, they just sat for a while then they would get up and go to the register and grab a menu. We ordered at the register and paid and tipped in advance because I missed the sign coming in from the bright sunlight adjustment in my eyes. We sat ourselves and waited a while - I had to go ask for my drinks and then received them then had to get up and ask for straws. It just seems like people are left in a state of confusion because of that 1 waitress. She gives silent treatment until they look upset. Then asks if they are ready to order.  I feel bad for the owners because of her. The young lady with the glasses was so sweet and attentive to the customers. I will never dine in again because of how the customers were mistreated by that one waitress and I just have to write about this because this could really be a bad thing for the success of this vegan restaurant and that would be very disappointing if people don't speak up when flaws like this are occurring. I would like to give it 5 stars for the food and decor.  2 stars only because of the poor hospitality received by the 1 waitress. I was contemplating asking for my money back and taking my business elsewhere but my husband and I were too hungry to leave so we just stuck it out. ***Update: the waitress no longer works there!! ***",

I've had breakfast, lunch, and dinner here and for the most part, you can get a good vegan meal. And its great because there arent many vegan restaurants in Vegas that serve a variety.  But a couple months ago, we noticed a few changes. 1.) They started serving breakfast only on Saturday and Sunday from 10-2. This was really disappointing as they were the only place that served vegan pancakes or breakfast in general anywhere (with the exception of a couple places).  Before they changed their times, we were going there at least once or twice a week. 2.) The prices went up and the quality has changed. Maybe its the cooks or something.   Hope you guys get it together.  We're rooting for you!!!",

I had heard of this place from a friend and we decided to try it with some non-vegan family.  Service- Friendly, helpful, quick  Food- I had the hippy chickpea burger gluten free. For not having a burger at a restaurant in a long time, I was happy to have it. I would give it a 4/5. The fries were amazing though. My husband had their bbq sandwich, and he said it tasted amazing. My son's nuggets were spot on. The in-laws had the nachos and bacon burger. They said both were good considering they are not vegan and used to that style.

VV now stands as Las Vegas' best vegan dining experience, a result of delicious food and a very nice and comfortable dining room. This type of vegan restaurant was badly needed in our city, and we are grateful to have a nice place to go out for a compassionate dining experience. I'm not going to start naming specific dishes that have been great, because every dish we have ordered has been great, and we have ordered different things each time  Our only small note would be the recurring theme on each visit of our food arriving at our table lukewarm instead of piping hot. This is a small suggestion that we hope ownership takes note of just to make VV a flawless vegan dining experience, because to reiterate, the food has been fresh and simply delicious on each of our visits so far, it would just be nice for the hot dishes and sides to actually be hot when they are placed in front of the diner. Other than that pretty small thing, HIGHLY recommended for our growing vegan community!",

My favorites were the sassy wings; bbq sauce was awesome, the California dreamin bacon burger & also a off the menu item created by the manager, blueberry muffin smoothie!! 5 stars.",

    "text": "WOW! This place is truly spectacular! My boyfriend are visiting Vegas for a few days and we decided to stop by for lunch. Again WOW!! The atmosphere was lovely- very clean and bright. The food was AMAZING!! I like that this places seems to focus on the \"holy trinity\" of Vegan \"meats\" (tempeh, seitan and tofu) verses mock vegan mystery meats. Everything we got was SO tasty and fresh. The Sassy Wings were definitely both of our favorites- fried tempeh coated in buffalo sauce served with vegan ranch. SOOO GOOD. We also got the blueberry iced tea, the bacon cheeseburger and violettes club sandwich. Again, everything was amazing. Our server, Kareen was so nice and sweet as well :)",

    "text": "I have only received deliveries from Violette's Vegan cafe. And every dish has been exceptional for A Vegan Restaurant. After the first time I ordered The Godfather I was hooked. I have ordered every day. The Mama Mia is exceptional. Most customers seem to order the burgers. But the Pad Thai is delicious, and I never knew that a vegan carrot cake could taste better than non/ vegan. The managers David and Kareen are always wonderful, they really give thought to my orders and always suggest what my taste buds crave. I am new to being a vegan for health issues. I wasn't sure that I would stick with it. I am now truly reformed. And it began with my first Violette's Vegan",
