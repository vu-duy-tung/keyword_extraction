It was an honest mistake, i just wanted to try something different because we've had you so many times and you are SO delicious! I was just  curious to see if there might be something else delicious out there for delivery. I was wrong.... DEAD WRONG! Your late nights and gourmet toppings are everything that a person could want. I was silly, and ordered a pizza from a flyer that was left on my doorknob. One bite and i knew it wasn't meant to be. I  called and told the owner that I wasn't satisfied with my order, and he gave some despicable response including, \" It;s just pizza, what do you expect?)\",I expect tasty pizza, duh!\". I just want to let you know that Pop-Up Pizza is not only  a delicious, late night food at a good price, but you are definitely fast and friendly, thank you.",

This is a good option if you are downtown and need to eat in a hurry, since it's right by the garage and the service is fast and efficient. It is decorated very nice, with faux Philippe Starck chairs and a life-sized horse art-piece named Fremont Filly.   I tried the Newport, which has ricotta (a bit much for my taste), artichoke, peppers, eggplant spinach and mushroom. I also tried the Fremont, with mozzarella, Italian sausage, bacon pepperoni and roasted peppers and eggplant.   One my visit, Gran, one of the owners, came over to see how evryhting was a give me a card with a free-delivery promo on it. All I need now is to find a group at work that wants to chip in for pizza!",

I came with my bf who was here for work and was on my own to explore during the day. Luckily I found this place to scratch my pizza itch! The pizza was legit: daiya cheese with veggies... Not to mention the very fancy artichokes on every slice. I dunno about you, but I judge the fanciness of my pizza by an artichoke's presence. The slices are quite large and the stick then in the pizza oven before they hand them to you... For the ready made slices. It was so good I brought my boyfriend back with me THE SAME DAY.",

There was a huge line from all the other people who were staying there for the festival, and I understand that they probably aren't usually that busy so having to wait wasn't an issue for me. The person in front of me, though, was not courteous about the wait and annoyed the guys working behind the counter so they started giving him attitude right back. While they were having their pissing contest, my pizza slices were in the oven and they were just left there for about 15 more minutes, before I realized that they were calling numbers past mine. When I asked them about it, they went to put in two more slices, opened the oven and realized they had already put them in. Then, without apologizing, they gave me the crusty AF, burnt slices. After already waiting almost 30 minutes for my pizza, I didn't bother to ask them to heat up two more because there was still a huge line. To top it off, the pizza wasn't even good, so needless to say I took my drunchies elsewhere the remaining days of the festival.",

(Yes, east coasters call it a pie.)  it is 18' so one pie will feed 5-8 people as 1-2 slices will fill almost anyone.  The toppings are great, the pepperoni is from Chicago and large flavorful slices instead of those microsliced ones you get on chain pizza.  The bacon was real and crisp.  There is a ton of flavor in their sauce and maybe just a touch too much oregano.  There is a lot of garlic but I like that.    The Chicken Strips are very good but be careful, the ranch has a garlic flavor to it and many don't like that.  The delivery person was very friendly and only had good things to say about the pizza place letting me know they get many repeat customers.  The fries aren't my favorite.  A bit soggy.  But they are healthier tasting than fast food.  I enjoyed the pizza and will definitely try more.  They have some interesting combinations.  The downside is they do not offer a lot of choices for the make your own pizza. (no pineapple or ham).",

On the first floor of the Plaza Hotel was Pop Up Pizza.  It looked very nice and bright, very clean and sheik, with great art work displayed on the walls, two tv's, great music and it was packed with people.  The first piece of pie that caught my eye was the Fremont because of the eggplant.  I loooove eggplant.  And the other piece I wanted to try was the Goodman which had potatoes as a topping, which was a something new for me.  And I also ordered a basket of garlic fries.  And to drink I was pleasantly surprised to find my all time favorite soda in the frige, Doc Brown's Cream Soda!!!  Hard to find, so I was shocked to see it here.  But this was a good sign that it was going to be a great meal.  The Fremont was fantastic.  The eggplant was baked just right, and very tasty and went great with the sausage and peppers.  The crust and bread had a perfect balance between soft and crunchy which completed it all.  The Goodman was great.  The potatoes were very flavorful and turned out to be a great topping on a pizza.  I would definitely have it again.  Garlic fries were hot and fresh, fries were nice and crispy.  And of course, the Doc Brown's Cream Soda was refreshingly solid as always.  Overall, it was great handmade gourmet pizza with reasonable prices, nice ambiance, good service, & Doc Brown's Cream Soda.  It's great quality food perfect for dinner, and fast enough for a quick lunch.  Definitely coming back.  This place could definitely become a regular stop.  I also put a name in for the Black Horse in front.  Hope I win!",

I usually only come here when I'm at the Plaza, which isn't often, but I always forget that this place is in here! You can order whole pizzas or choose from the slices they have siting on the counter, which they will throw in the oven for you when you order. I recommend getting the 2 slice and drink combo for $7.99 which is an excellent value for what you're getting. The last time I was here I got a slice of pepperoni and a slice of the Plaza which had Italian sausage, ricotta cheese and sweet peppers and mmmmm it was so nom nom good. Can't go wrong with this place and they're open until 2 am which is perfect for those late nights on Fremont St if you can remember this place is there",

They are vegetarian and vegan friendly with vegan soft-serve and pizza. Their plain cheese is basic but tasty and they have a number of specialty pizzas, as well. I like the Goodman, which is topped with potatoes!  The garlic knots are amazing- do not skip them! While ordering delivery we were told we had to get a minimum of 10, which is a lot, but we ended up reheating them with leftover slices over the next few days and they were great even as leftovers! (I recommend freezing and then reheating for 10 minutes at 400 F.)  Anyway, it's nice to have a decent pizza place to order from nearby; don't be fooled by its weird location in the Plaza, this is good pizza!",

    "text": "Wow, am I glad that this pizza place decided to 'Pop Up'!  Totally gives Downtown LV a good place to get some decent pie!    Finally got around to eating at Pop Up Pizza the weekend The Plaza had the Hot Wheels Super Convention in town.  Hot Wheels?  Toys?  Pizza?  Can't get much better than that!  Well, if I was rich it would have made it a bit better.  Seriously, Pop Up Pizza is one of the better places to get a bite.  I love me my Hawaiian eats and such, but sometimes you wanna get away from cheap prime rib, teri chicken bowls and oxtail soup, and just opt for something lighter.  Easier to digest.  This will fit the bill nicely!  Pop Up Pizza is like lots of other pie joints in town, got a display area for ready to go slices, or you can just order off the menu and wait for your pie to be made.  If I was with the family, no doubt we would have gone the order a fresh pie route.  Since it was just me that day (with a few limited edition toys in my other hand) I decided to get a few slices to go.  Luckily their #1 combo of any two slices and a drink for $7.99 was right up my alley.  I have no problem with reheating pizza in the oven for a few minutes as long as the pie hasn't been sitting there for TOO long.  Of all the slices I wanted to try (and the list was long), I opted for the ones that weren't dried over.  As luck would have it I managed to get two of their top choices.  And wouldn't you know, I almost went damn near Vegan!  I ended up with slices of:  #The Newport - Ricotta, roasted artichoke, peppers, eggplant, spinach, and mushrooms with garlic olive oil  #The Soho (uber popular by Hippies & Tree Huggers alike..I kid, I kid) - Vegan mozzarella, spinach, mushrooms, artichoke, and roasted bell peppers  After a few minutes in the oven to reheat, and a drink filling, I was on my way out the door!  But...I caught a whiff of my goodies and just couldn't resist.  Walked back to the dining area of Pop Up Pizza and popped open that box.  Oh the joy!  This was seriously some great pie!  The Newport was yummy, full of veggies, a nice serving of cheese, hint of sauce (good sauce by the way), and a still crunchy but not soggy on top crust.  And was I surprised by The Soho!  Delicious, delicious, delicious.  The Vegan mozzarella didn't taste Vegan at all, had good melt.  With the veggies and the light crust, I had no problem finishing this off.  Imagine, me, a meal with no meat!  And I was satisfied!  I can see some of they hype with the Vegan pie.  Good show Pop Up Pizza!  Only downer for me?  P-E-P-S-I.  Ugh!  I just feel Pepsi products are too strong to go with any type of pizza!  But that's just me being biased to Coca-Cola.  There is a reason why 'Coke is it'!  But this is just a minor inconvenience.  I'll just sit at a machine and order a BEER.    You can bet I will be back to Pop Up Pizza anytime I can get myself to actually go Downtown.  I do want to try some of their other pies and maybe sample some of their Garlic Knots (I'm a sucker for anything overly garlicky).  So glad you guys decided to POP UP!",

    "text": "Wow. I wasn't expecting much from this little pizza counter inside The Plaza downtown, but I'm pleasantly surprised. I got the 2 slice combo for $10. They're pretty big slices too. Got the White Chapel which is a white pizza with ricotta and spinach on it. And the Scintas which has pepperoni,  sausage and ham I think. The crust was just the right thickness, not too doughy, not too thin. The pies are already made and they throw your slice back in the oven to warm if you get it by the slice but it didn't lose any deliciousness in the reheating.",

Slices are huge with great ingredient combos available with local downtown names like the 18b, The Goodman, The 5th St, The Plaza and the Fremont.  Toppings cheese and sauce are a plenty on this pie.  Pizza by the slice are pre-made and ready to be reheated for around $3 a slice and up.  Whole pies are $18 and up depending on the specialty you desire and can take 20-25 minutes to get ready.  Call ahead for pickup or have a beer while you wait in there seating area that opens on to The Plaza casino floor.  Either way the pizza is worth the wait.",

Of course, starting this detox with pizza makes the most sense right??  The Fremont caught my eye because of the roasted eggplant. I had to try it! It was SO good along with the crispy thin crust, which I am a sucker for. If I was a local, I would be a regular just for this order.   The guy handing out the pizza was a bit of a stickler though. My group of friends were the only ones at the restaurant, but he wouldn't let us grab each other's orders for one another.",

Pizza is New York style, and so is the method - prebaked pies, slices heated in the oven to order.  I ordered two slices - The Newport and The Scintas.  The first was a vegetarian, with riccota, artichoke hearts, spinach, eggplant, bell peppers and mushrooms.  It was good, but not really to my liking - my fault for ordering a slice without meat, which I almost never do.  I'm sure vegetarians would enjoy.  The Scintas slice was more up my alley.  Basically a meat lovers slice.  Very tasty.  The big winner was the slice the lady got, which was The White Chapel - a white slice with ricotta, spinach, and roasted garlic olive oil. Holy cow, this thing was good - cheesy, garlicky, and rich.  Good thing we only had that one slice between us, since I probably would have eaten too much of it if left to my own devices.",

I didn't have a full pie, just a perfect slice of cheese pizza.  The crust was chewy and had a nice yeasty flavor.  It was so good, I really wanted to get another slice.  The sauce had a solid natural tomato flavor and a nice mild zip.  Really terrific.  Just can't wait to go back and maybe even order a full pie this time.    Have also found the employees to be not only friendly but helpful as well.  The typical wait time is average and food comes out in an acceptable amount of time.  The price for their full pies is a little steep, but actually well worth it for pizza that is this tasty. Yum!!",

Maybe it's because I waited so long, maybe quality has gone down, I have no idea. All I know is that tons of my Yelp friends raved about this place and slapped down five stars and I was a bit underwhelmed.   Opted for the Newport (ricotta, artichoke, peppers, eggplant, spinach and mushrooms topped with a garlic infused olive oil) and the Soho (Vegan mozzarella, spinach, mushrooms, artichoke, and roasted bell peppers)-- both were heated to order, boxed up to go, and helpfully accompanied by packets of peppers and cheese.  I found the Newport to only have a single dollop of ricotta, but liked the roasted veggies. Did not taste any garlic infused olive oil though, and I love garlic. The Soho simply taught me that I do not like vegan cheese- still appreciated the veggies though. BF's take on the slices were that he loved the crispy crust but felt the sauce was too acidic. For both of us, the flavors just didn't quite come together.  Side note; current pricing for two-slice combo is $8.99, up from what is posted in the tips section on the app.",

Our order ($53):   2 pizzas House Salad with ranch instead of Italian 4 extra ranch (charged extra for each)  Our order took an hour and 15 minutes to get to us, even though the Plaza is only 3 blocks away from our office. I probably could have walked to pick it up quicker than it was delivered. The pizza was...luke warm and the crust was very tough to bite through. It didn't taste awful, but it's not as good as the reviews made it out to be. The salad? It was tossed in Italian dressing and didn't even include any ranch on the side. And speaking of ranch dressing, we only got 3 out of the 4 we ordered!  The quality of food, lack of attention to our order and time it took to have it delivered were very disappointing. Definitely won't be ordering from here again.",

First time, I thought the service was kind of slow (5 mins for a slice) but since I wasn't in any particular hurry it didn't matter.  The pizza was pretty good but pricey.  After today I'm never going back.  Incredible jerks who operate this place. Ordered a slice and then sat down.  Wait, wait, wait and then finally I go up to the counter and they don't even have the decency to come over and apologize for not making my order.  Guy behind the counter says \"give me 30 seconds\" as he shoves a slice in the oven.  Apparently I wasn't the only one they screwed over.  While he was discussing another botched order with a customer, he takes my slice out of the oven and then shoves it over the counter without a word as if I magically know that's for me.  Kinda service I'd expect in new york but not here.  If you don't care about your customers then go somewhere else.    This time the pizza was pretty mediocre.  It wasn't hot, after 30 secs in the oven.  Crust was rubbery and the sauce tasted like out of a can.  Probably because had been sitting out all day and they reheated it.  Definitely not worth $5.  If you're from out of town don't waste your time and money eating at dumps like this.   Their pizzas look decent and maybe they're good when fresh but considering the service and the mediocre slices it's not worth trying again.   There's better places around town for pizza.   BTW, the brunette behind the counter both times I've been there obviously hates her job and doesn't like dealing with people, or maybe she's a complete nit.  Since I live close I asked if they took phone orders and did they validate parking.   I'm not going to hassle with plaza parking and pay for it too but hey if you can get a pizza and parking for a few hours then it might be worth it.  She says 'no'.  They used to do it but they stopped.  Now you have to have to get your ticket validated at one of the casino machines and she points down the hall.  \"Okay, so you do validate parking but you have to do it at the machine, right?\"  She says, \"I don't know\" and then she goes into this long rant about how they used to stamp tickets, blah, blah, blah.  Geez lady, c'mon, it was a simple question.",

Think a hybrid between Neapolitan style and New York style. Exceptional ingredients that are perfectly portioned with the crust. Oh the crust, light, yet firm, a with a nice crunch on the edge yet soft and pillowy inside. The crust in the center holds up to the toppings with ease. By the slice, by the pie, heck buy the slice or buy the pie. Four styles to choose from with an additional 4 on the way in the next few weeks...including a vegan variety. An entiere pie will run you about $22, by the slice-$3.50 Pop Up Pizza is located on the south end of The Plaza, just as you enter the front door from Main St. Run, do not walk to this place. Soon the lines will be out the door, up Fremont Street, then all the way down Las Vegas Blvd to the Secret Pizza Place at the Cosmo. Yeah, it's that good.",

    "text": "Came across this place after attending an Elvis festival on Freemont Street. Is located inside the Plaza Hotel. My friend sugested it as a great option to gran a quick bite with the kids, and I must say was I glad she did!  The pizza is amazing! We order a traditoonal pepperoni for the kiddos and I went with the newport which has spinach, artichokes, mushrrom and ricotta cheese and loved every bite of it. The portions are huge too which is always a plus and is priced very reasonable. I recommend ordering a whole pie(way cheaper) and you can take home the leftovers. The white chapel is another one of my favorites!  Another big plus is their service, the employees are super nice and willing to acomodate you(very refreshing for a place inside a casino). All in all a great addition to the Downtown revitalization and one more lunch option for those like me that work downtown. So next time you go to the Freemon street experience make sure you check out POP UP PIZZA you can thank me later.",

They have great prices for such big slices, but I think drinks cost more than the pizza! It was worth it though. The only thing that would have been better was a bit thicker on the crust, but I know it's New York-style, so I can't really complain. My only disappointment was that they discontinued the soft serve ice cream right before I got into town. I was really looking forward to trying that.",

There pepperoni is suppose to be the bomb, but it was just ok. The pizza was just way too greasy!",

When I asked, the counter chica told me that it's because it came with marinara.    Frankly, I went there because they have garlic rolls, one of my favorite treats.  The ones here were okay but barely.  The bread was slightly chewy so that was good, but instead of butter, they were covered in oil of some sort and then garlic that tasted like it came from a jar.  The kicker was that the extra 58  cents I was charged for the marinara sauce was ICE COLD.  For hot garlic rolls.  Ugh.  The slice of pizza was good as was the one my husband got.  Had I skipped the garlic rolls, this place would be a four-star.",

We stopped by Pop Up Pizza, she ordered a slice of meatball with kalamata olives and onions and I ordered the eggplant with sausage, pepperoni and red peppers. They were warmed up quickly and I enjoyed the toppings and the dough was solid too, but I had hoped it would be cooked a little more evenly. My friends was nicely cooked and had a nice char, but mine was on the doughy side.  Overall, I enjoyed my pizza, but found the dough to be a little inconsistent.",

    "text": "I was excited to find so many vegan options in Vegas and since this place offered vegan pizza late at night, we had to try it. Unfortunately they do not take phone orders so we had to drive all the way from the strip, then place our order once we arrived, only to find out that the pizza chef was on a break and we'd have to wait for him to get back- about 20-30min for our pizza to be made.  We waited because we were already there and starving and too exhausted to go anywhere else.  The woman that took our order was also very sweet and apologetic!    I was also bummed that they no longer offer the vegan soft serve which is still advertised on their menu.  I was really looking forward to trying it, and in all honesty, was the real reason I wanted to go there in the first place.  If you've never had vegan pizza or don't get to have it often, I recommend trying it.  It just wasn't  extremely amazing compared to others I've had (in LA).. Basic crust, veggies, diya cheese.   But I must say that I'm grateful they offer vegan options!   Ps.  The olives are super salty- don't get them, it will ruin the taste (and I love olives).",

They tout the pepperoni as being \"special\" and \"from Chicago.\" It was fine but did not taste better than any premium pepperoni you can purchase at Trader Joe's or Whole Foods.   Chicken wings were small and dry. Fried pickles were large and juicy but lacking in flavor. Luckily they were both saved by the BEST PART of this order which was the RANCH DRESSING. Yum. It's like a cross between ranch and an aioli. The best ranch I've ever had, anything will taste good in this stuff.  I'm sure this pizza is fine if you're drunk and downtown but I wouldn't go out of my way. Would not order again.",

    "text": "Im hungry. Lets see what pops up on my bookmarks. Well, would you look at that. Pop Up Pizza just happens to be about 3 blocks away.  First off, the place is located inside The Plaza Hotel and Casino. You can park in the Plaza parking lot for 5 bucks cash only (free for those that are gold or platinum or whatever card you need that the sign says at the gate). Dont worry though, keep your parking receipt, have the attendant at PUP stamp your parking receipt after you pay for your food, and then take that stamped receipt to the cashier at the cashier cage about 50 yards away so they can give you your 5 bucks back.  As you go up to the counter, you can see garlic knots and all the pizza that is available for purchase by the slice. If you refer to my pic, they have this combo menu right on counter. You have 6 options. I picked combo number 1 which is any two slices and a large soda for 7.99. I selected a slice of the Harris Meatball Pie and the Fremont.  The Harris Meatball Pie: Mozzarella, classic Italian meatballs, caramelized onions, olives and topped with fresh basil. Nuff said. The Fremont: Mozzarella, Italian sausage, bacon, pepperoni, roasted peppers, and roasted eggplant. Again, nuff said.  The only negatives I observed is that when you park in the Plaza parking lot, you gotta walk past the Greyhound bus station. That place in itself is a whole other review. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/greyhound-bus-lines-las-vegas#query:greyhound%20bus%20station\">yelp.com/biz/greyhound-b...</a> Also, where the seating area is for PUP is basically in the wide open portion of the casino itself, meaning that whatever secondhand smoke is lingering around will give your pizza the smoke flavoring that you dont want.  Some random info: I was told there was free wifi but I couldnt get it to work for me. The domain is popup pizza. The password is popuppizza1. They are open daily from 11 am to 2 am for you guys that have the munchies late at night.  In closing, I think their thin crust pizza is pretty good. Its just the 5 dollar parking that you eventually get back, the scenic route to PUP, and the unwanted added secondhand smoke flavoring to my pizza that kind of ruins the moment.

    "text": "Whoa. Did I just find some decent peez in LV? Thank you, Baby Jesus!!  Pop Up manages to turn out pies with a thin, crunchy crust and a flavorful cheese/sauce combo. That's really all there is to 'za (makes you wonder how so many people screw it up). Bonus:  The pepperoni on the Main St. is arguably better than the average pepp slice you would get in NY. Tons of flavor.  The set specialty slices they have are a bit all over the place (I find each slice to have one odd ingredient), but if you have a few peeps with you, order a custom pie and make it your own. The only real negative I have is that a few of the pies they had out looked like they were sitting there for a while. Always a downer to see that.  The location is odd, sure, but worth a visit if you need a quick bite while on Freemont. While it's not quite at full east coast pizzeria level yet, if they start putting together some sicilian and grandma slices out, I could def give it the 5-star nod.

The pizzas looked amazing. Plus, slice prices were very reasonable for what you get (around $3.50).  I had the pleasure of two different slices:  18b - Traditional cheese pizza infused with herbs. Very tasty, with a great crispy crunch to along with it.  Goodman - There's a lot going on with this pizza. In fact, I thought too much was going on. The flavor combo on this one wasn't the best with the caramelized onions, potato, etc. I preferred the simplicity of the 18b over this. Still, pretty decent.  In terms of pizza, they do come off on the lighter side. They are not overly greasy, leaving me with a notable crispy crust to munch on.  If hungry, it might take 2-3 slices to get your fill.   It might be a little disappointing to go out of your way specifically for the pizza, but it's a definite stop if I'm in the area.   Note: Parking at the Plaza is a bit of a pain. Pay $5 to get in, get validation wherever you eat, then run to the cashier cage to get your money back. It's a slight run around, but just make sure you have cash to get in!",

They were happy to do it. Holy moly...that was a crazy good pizza. The crust was crispy but tender, sauce was perfect, red potatoes were almost creamy. The best vegan pizza I've ever had. Also ordered the fried pickles, which had a nice balance of pickle spear and breading. I highly recommend Pop Up.",

Now, I make a pretty stellar vegan pizza at home - so I judge others fairly rigorously.  I can't beat Pop Up's sauce or crust, so theirs beats mine hands down.  They also are perfectly light-handed with the Daiya cheese - which can be a bit much if laid on too heavy.  Loved it - my favorite slice of pizza in town!  A HUGE plus? One of the guys stopped by my table and commented \"You finally got your vegan pizza\" - he actually remembered me from two weeks prior!  You can't beat that kind of customer service.",

We get delivery most of the time but sometimes have to go pick it up because their driver doesn't start until 6p which seems a little ridiculous. I'm not going to deduct a star for that because, the pie is so good, I'll pick it up if that's what it takes.  The Goodman is awesome and the garlic knots are the best I've ever had.

We also had the Pepperoni and Mushroom which was my boyfriends absolute favorite (probably mine too if he let me have more than a bite). We also shared some chicken strips that came with fries. Trust me it was not because we were drunk, but we were devouring this food, wanting more even though we were stuffed. It was simply delicious!

My welcome booklet came with a deal on two slices of cheese and a drink, but I just asked if I could pay a little extra for toppings.  The storefront is cool looking and they were playing a lot of dubstep...probably because it was EDC week. The workers there were friendly, and even though there is no soda fountain outside, you can still get free refills of your drink by asking.  I got a slice of their White Chapel pizza (ricotta and spinach) as well as a generic meat lovers. The White Chapel is sooo goooood! The other one was tasty too, but I preferred the White Chapel despite the lack of meat. The slices are pretty big, and I really liked the crisp yet chewy crust. Dare I say I liked it better than Secret Pizza, a Vegas joint on the strip that also has NY style pizza?

So if you walk into the casino from.the street, walk to the left (opposite from the food court).  Piricing isn't too bad, they have a combo of 2 slices and a drink for $10.   Tried the White Chapel Pizza and it was cheese, but would have loved it more if it had a creamier taste to it, like an Alfredo sauce.. Also, I had a slice of Vegan Pizza. This was actually pretty good considering it was vegan.",

We tried three different slices:  The Goodman (mozzarella, caramelized onions, roasted mushrooms, spinach + red potato), The 18b (classic marinara/mozzarella) and The White Chapel (a white pie with mozzarella, ricotta, roasted garlic oil and sauteed spinach).  The two veggie slices were tasty with a great balance of flavors and textures. The cheese slice was fine, but I much preferred the cheese slices at Pizza Rock.   If you walk the Fremont Experience and exit out at The Plaza, Pop Up Pizza (located at the back of the casino) is a delightful find (and pizza's always a good way to curb the effects of late-night drinking!).",

Despite the long over the phone order, I thought the service was pretty good!  And the pizza was REALLY good!! Slices are huge. My group enjoyed the pizza and we had tons left over for the next day. I'd order from this place again, but I'd definitely allow at least an hour to place the order and have it arrive in time for dinner. Yum!",

Except that they had delivered to us the night before. So we asked if it would be possible to do it tonight at all. He said no. So we asked why it had taken so long to get back to us. He said they tried to call us but no one answered. Then we asked if we should call somewhere else and they could just lose our business to which the guy hung up the phone with no answer. It's really a shame because the pizza is really good. The service tho... We're shocked at how terrible it is. We will NOT be ordering from pop up any longer. :(",

So I get there and they didn't even begin making my food because they didn't get a ding or whatever. So I had to sit and wait for my food to be made.

For the past few years I have been addicted to the Secret Pizza at The Cosmopolitan, and this year I have cheated on it and now things will just never be the same between us. As a matter of fact Pop Up Pizza is so good that I ate its pie twice...in the same night....with only a few hours of rest and one rather loaded yard long pina colada to slow me down. What I thought was just going to be a one night stand turned into so much more. The crust so perfectly charred, so crispy and thin. The sauce so sweet, the topping so fresh, the cheese so creamy.  And they also give you a little something extra on the side. How about some hot sizzling action from the fryer. How about trying the pickle ? Deep fried and delicious served with creamy ranch. Or how about French fries with fresh minced Garlic and Parmesan ? Oh yes please. Give me more.  Sometimes I just need some variety in my life, a chance to experiment. Pop Up Pizza has a orgy of different pies to choose from including an exotic Vegan Pie.   So it is with a small amount of guilt that I must break off my relationship with the Cosmo Secret Pizza.  I hope we can still be friends,  but I have found a new love and I am moving on.  Thank you Pop Up Pizza...I am forever yours...faithfully.",

    "text": "I made a point to go to Pop Up Pizza last weekend because I have noticed little articles and shout outs about the place over the past few months.  Get the Dayia cheese out because I'm really excited to try the pizza!    We ordered 2 pizzas to go.  Bf was a little shocked by the price but I say whatev, we took away two 18\" pizzas to enjoy for the rest of the weekend.  I ordered a vegan cheese pizza with carmelized onions and olives.  It was great.  The crust was thin but the edge was thick and soft-chewy.  There was plenty of cheese and when you use a pizza oven the Dayia actually melts like cheese should rather then turn rubbery.  I would have preferred more onions but that's just me.  I think the olives were kalamata instead of canned black ones so I will skip those next time.    Bf ordered his with onions, jalapenos and mushrooms.  He had the same positive comments about his crust and taste so I see more pieces of Pop Up Pizza being consumed in our future.    A little bit more sauce would have been appreciated but I will defer to their pizza engineer expertise when it comes to sauce-crust-topping-ratios.    Besides offering vegan cheese for me the other best part about this place is that the casino bar has $1 beer!  That's all I have to say about that.",

    "text": "Strolling through the extremely dead Plaza Casino on a Thursday night, I was looking for a spot to get a decent beer, and to get something to eat other than McDonald's, and was coming up short on both efforts. Pop-Up Pizza to the rescue!   I spotted them at the end of the casino and noticed that they were indeed open. I ordered a slice of their White Chapel and enjoyed a cold Stella while waiting. (Stella's not my top choice for beer, but it will do in a pinch). The slice of pie - white pizza with ricotta, garlic, and spinach, was a great slice of pie, especially for the price ($3.75) and at late night. Service was super friendly. There was an issue of a belt sander going off at a nearby spot of the casino, but that's no fault of Pop-Up Pizza - whose employees were as perplexed about the noise as I and the other patrons are.  At this time of night, I can't imagine the pies were that fresh, and I can only imagine they taste even better during the day. But this was still a very good piece of pie that hit the spot at the right time.",

    "text": "Pop Up Pizza is great because of the price, the location and especially the food. The White Chapel, or \"white pizza\" is incredible with no tomato sauce but still tasty with ricotta and spinach. The traditional pepperoni pizza outdoes other traditional pizzas offered at other places. The other specialty pizzas such as The 18b with basil and fresh herbs topped with grated mozzarella cheese, or The Goodman made with mozzarella, caramelized onions, mushrooms, spinach, and potatoes or The Fremont made with mozzarella, Italian sausage, bacon, pepperoni, roasted peppers, and roasted eggplant are excellent at an even better price.   This is located in the Plaza Hotel and Casino in downtown Las Vegas but the vibe is fun, funky and urban so live a little and enjoy the rejuvenated Fremont Street.",

He helped me pick out a pizza to take a slice from and I grabbed a $.50 garlic knot as well with a small drink (mostly a cup of ice). The pizza really was delicious. And the garlic knot was too. Definitely hit the spot when my 12am craving had kicked in for food. Like most things in Las Vegas it was a bit over priced for a slice of pizza that had maybe been sitting around on the counter for awhile and a drink that was mostly ice. About $8 in all. Being off the strip I'd hoped it would be more reasonable but it is at the end of the Fremont Experience in the Plaza Hotel so I didn't exactly expect it to be mom and pop pizzeria priced. I'd suggest this place to friends for sure.",

I usually am not a fan of hotels but being that this Pop Up is located toward the front and the Plaza has been renovated, I didn't notice the usual smoke smell.  Service was really good.  Myself and my two coworkers ordered the whole pie, that math was a better deal then their by the slice option and we had leftovers to take back.  We ordered pepperoni and cheese although all the other options looked delicious too.  The pizza isn't thick or thin but somewhere in the middle.  It was a little greasy but I just blotted the excess with a napkin.",

So after a long ride from LA and not having eaten for a while, I was due for a major grub fest. I got a slice of pepperoni and a slice of cheese. When my order came up, I was surprised at how big the slices were. Even better, they included a complementary slice of spinach pizza. The pizza was really delicious, and the crust was bomb. Nice and crunchy. If I ever find myself in Downtown Las Vegas again, I'm gonna go back for a slice for sure.",

I gave them a 3 out of 5 because they decided to spray clean the tables and chairs with this harsh foaming agent while we were eating. So we were tasting this yummy pizza while inhaling this chemical smell. If you like to enjoy your meal then you will understand that this is a restaurant FAIL.

I was walking around the sports book when I saw Pop Up Pizza I walked over to see what they were serving up. POP UP PIZZA was selling some creative and good looking slices, I mean the quality of the ingredients were on point. They must have a 50% food cost ( I hope not) but it sure looks like they really pride themselves on quality ingredients .   I got 2 slices the vegan and the Oscar. I'm not a Vegan but I just wanted to see what the hype was. I now know why this pizza gets so much attention. It's just down right good without the guilt . The dough was just perfect, I asked the young girl were they bought their dough, she replied that  the dough they were using was hand made daily AWESOME FRESSNESS at its finest.   I can honestly say that it's a drive from the South West side of town but I will definatly stop by on first fridays and whenever I have my NY friends who think their city has the best pizza.

The garlic, spinach, and ricotta cheese was so delicious, BUT THEY TOOK IT OFF THE MENU. You can't even create your own pizza as a white pizza.  We tried. They denied. Their white onion sauce is gross.  It also seems like they changed pepporoni 'its smaller and saltier. And the garlic knots are bigger,  but dense and chewy.   Guess we will have to order from another pizza place like Evel Pie during our stays The Plaza.  Did they ownership change?",

I ordered the vegan slice with vegan garlic knots. The Mr got a spinach/white slice.  The pizza was OK, not the best but not the worst. It was a little bit soggy and not flavorful enough.  The garlic knots were really just mini round rolls and were over cooked. They were not garlicky at all, and they were dry. Definitely would not order the garlic knots there again.  Also, the marinara sauce that came with it was cold and kind of just tasted like ketchup - no seasonings at all. Side note- my absolute favorite garlic knots in this town are the ones at Pizza Company, those are life-changing!  Also, since we weren't staying at the hotel they don't validate your parking. So we had to spend $10 on parking in addition to $20 for two slices, two sodas, and a small order of knots ...w parking it all came out to a $30 adventure.  Totally not worth it.",

Idk if you've ever had vegan cheese but 99% of it tastes like the underside of carpets. But this is the 1% of vegan cheese that holds all the nation's wealth of animal-friendly flavor. The crust is so crispy and buttery and they sautee their mushrooms. It doesn't get anymore cruelty free or delicious my dudes.",

However, their pizza completely changed my view about thin pizzas. My boyfriend also tried their cheese pizzas & he finds them delicious as well. Within 4 days of staying in Las Vegas, we stopped by this restaurant twice. Overall, if you get a chance, stop by the Plaza Hotel to get a slice of Pop Up Pizza's.. pizza. You definitely won't regret it.",

I spoke to this chick who took my order and then transferred my call to the delivery guy to figure out delivery time. They took my order, got my credit card information, but NEVER told me how much my order costed me. Initially when I asked they said they had to call me back in 15mins because they are not at the register or something. They called me back --still didn't tell me how much it costed me in their voicemail saying that I had to confirm the order so they could deliver it. So I called back to confirm the order and then when I asked how much the total was, the dude just kept on saying that he doesn't remember it on top of his head because he had already left the store. Come to find out on upon delivery that 2 pizzas costed me over $50!!!! Ridiculous! The dude just showed up with the 2 pizza boxes and the receipt of what they had charged on my card for me to sign. I still went ahead and paid for it, but could not get over the fact that I feel so ripped off and scammed. My coworkers told me how crazy I was for still paying for it, but I told them, \"NEVER AGAIN\". People who work at this place need to be trained more, for real. I will make  a formal complaint about this to the business bureau because this just isn't right.",

That being said, it is without hesitation that I deliver my very first five-star rating to Pop-Up Pizza.  It's just that good.  If you've been following along, I have been searching for good east-coast style pizza since moving to LV.  Cosmo Secret Pizza is close (although it's kind of greasy and it's not really a secret anymore).  Everything else has fallen flat.  I had heard about Pop-Up Pizza and decided that the trek to downtown was worth the possible payout.  If you only look at the counter and remove the setting, Pop Up looks nearly identical to the Cosmo joint.  They even have boxed wine should you choose to go that route.  There were only a few pie choices, but even then it was hard to decide.  I went with the 18b (cheese pizza with homemade red sauce) and The Goodman (a carb-tastic behemoth with spinach and potatoes).  Both slices were amazing.  The crust had a snap and then a chew.  It was a contradiction of terms, and it was amazing.  The red sauce had a perfect blend of seasoning.  And potatoes on pizza sounds ridiculous, but you have to try it.  I would eat here every day if I could.  Unfortunately, The Plaza is not close to home.  At the same time, I think this is better - now I can truly savor my Pop Up Pizza experience and enjoy it.",

I read all the glowing reviews of Pop Up, and I thought, thank you jesus, a great pizza place in Las Vegas to go along with the very very very few other great pizza places. But alas, THIS IS NOT IT!  Not even close.  The sauce tastes like the spaghetti sauce you'd get at Vons. The crust is nice and soft, but not fully-evolved: too much floury flavors. And a touch too thick.  The mozzarella is so not there, it may as well not be there.  The pepperoni is so large it looks more like salami, and doesn't have that spicy kick that puts the damn \"pepper\" in pepperoni!  It doesn't end there.  Their business model is as retarded as the Secret Pizza place at the Cosmo. They don't have a menu. They have only one size pizza: 18 inch. They clearly missed the memo from high school business class that says: give the consumer choices and make him feel like he's getting what he wants.   Oh, and I almost forgot, it's expensive....almost 20 bucks for an 18 inch (we don't have any other size) pie.

The crust was nice and soft yet still paradoxically crispy.     While we ate there we were approached by the owner just to see if we were enjoying ourselves and our pizza.  Now that's service if you ask me.  He mentioned that they were planning on rotating their menu of pizzas to try new combinations out and see how the public reacts and keep the ones that are crowd-pleasing.

    "text": "Two words: Vegan Pizza. I, being a vegetarian, liked the SoHo pizza. Albeit, this is my first time ever trying a vegan pizza with vegan cheese- but I liked it! The cheese is a little on the sticky side, it will stick to your teeth, but I don't care. It's a creamy cheese, like...well, cream cheese. It wasn't thin and crunchy, and the toppings kinda fell off, but again, I don't care. Others, like my boyfriend, do slightly care about that. He wasn't a fan of it, and the poor guy bought an entire pie for us. We later went back and had different slices, and he thought those were much better, especially the no sauce spinach and cheese slices (he ordered this time, so I have no idea what the name of this pie is) and it tastes kind of like cheesy bread. The downfall is this- they STILL do not have the vegan ice cream machine. So they have no deserts at all :(",

You cant beat that!  It's located in the Lobby/Casino area of the Plaza which is right walking distance from all of the casinos in that area.   It cost $5 to self park at the hotel but when you get your parking ticket validated they refund your $5!! Perfect!  This is definitely on my list of places to stop next time I am back in Sin City!",

It seems like it is a secret pizza spot but it's not, it''s BETTER. I spoke to the lady behind the counter she was very polite and she knew every detail of every pizza.  I spoke to some guy named Chef Mikey he was  behind the scenes most of the time I watched him take a spoon to his secret red sauce and commented to his right hand man that the sauce was perfect. I really liked the communication and vibe this place has. My BF really enjoys pizza and he said hands down that this was the best pie he had ever enjoyed. We will defiantly be back for their grand opening FREE SLICE OF PIZZA we are so in.    THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU for opening up Down Town!  P.S. I hear they have a crazy good Vegan pizza from my vegan friend.",

The pizza is still awesome, but I recommend asking for extra sauce these days, as the pies seem on drier side.  ORIGINAL REVIEW: So, I would like to leave a split review here. I love the pizza, but I am continually disappointed with the organizational abilities of this place. They seem to have a really difficult time understanding pizza orders beyond their signature pizzas, especially if you want some things on the whole pizza but also some different things on each half. Then tonight I tried to place an order for delivery, but no one answered the phone during the hour I tried calling. Thinking maybe they are just really busy, I tried their online ordering system. The order went in (and sent a charge to my credit card) and said the pizza would arrive in 45 minutes. An hour later I tried calling again to see if they got the order, but still no one answered. I called the hotel to try reaching them by their extension, but I only got voicemail. I left a message, requesting someone call me and confirm my pizza was coming. An hour after that (involving several more attempts to call them), I ordered a pizza from somewhere else. The whole situation is absurd. The pizza is really good, though.",

I'm fkn heartbroken. No more 'Soho', no more 'White Chapel'...just cheaper, watered down replacement recipes that folks who don't know better are somehow raving about. Prolly just influenced by older 5 star reviews & imagining that it lives up to expectations that it actually no longer can. This is truly heartbreaking. Gotta find a new vegan pie as they ruined the perfect one here (used to be a highlight of every Vegas run).",

It's pretty obvious just by looking at the menu what this is. This is an exquisitely put together pizza so you get what you pay for, and you pay a premium.   A lot of crappy pizza can be found on Fremont. A few places are actually good, but these are far outnumbered by the bad ones. Skip those terrible pizzas sitting in the windows. Come to the Plaza Hotel and Casino. Yes you heard that right. It's one of the dumpiest casinos in downtown, but they have the best fucking pizza according to many here. This is located near the casino floor, so you can play during the wait. Slices are about $5 each. The whole pizzas can cost you about $18 to $26. It sounds ridiculous. Thankfully the slices are massive, so you do get a lot without having to get a whole. I really liked the SoHo. This is vegan. It comes with artichokes, peppers, and spinach. They pile it on thankfully.   I'm not sure if I would get this again. It's good but just costs too much. This is host for a special occasion but not all the time.",

Located at Plaza Hotel & Casino, and as such an unlikely candidate for accolades including the local papers, Tripadvisor and fellow Pizzaiolos singing its praises, guests looking for Pop Up will find it halfway between the property's front doors and Self-Parking access, the convenience no doubt part of Pop Up's popularity but even a cursory look suggesting something better than expected.  Based on quality Ingredients and a childhood in his father's Restaurants, Vakneen finding his love of Pizza during the recession and soaking up knowledge ever since, it is atop Dough treated to lengthy fermentation that housemade Tomato Sauce is carefully spread, the 18\" whole Pies a tremendous value ranging from $18-$23 depending on topping for an airy edge and charred bottom that picks up just enough crispiness to be foldable without breaking.  Additionally offering Knots, Wings, Fried Pickles and even a Vegan Pie, all at a fair price and serving their purpose, it was with good fortune that 6:00pm additionally found one of Michael's Detroit-style Pies fresh from the oven, the overlapping Cheese nicely caramelized into a fine lattice while the bottom was dimpled, buttery and light.   FOUR STARS:  Attempting to set aside service, but impossible to do so entirely as two encounters with the same young woman were protracted to the point of exhausting, there is nonetheless no doubt that Pop Up ranks amongst Sin City's top Slices and warrants a look from anyone in the area.",

I arrived in Vegas at 10pm starving, and happily stumbled across Pop Up, which is located inside the Plaza Hotel & Casino. You place your order, and pick up it up at opposing ends of the counter. There is a small seating area, but the place is loud and hectic, so you probably want to take your order to go.   When I arrived, 30 or so European tourists huddled around the register and display case in a crowd. After waiting for about 10 minutes, the huddle did not seem to be moving, so I asked one of the pizza maker guys where the line began. \"Apparently in their country they don't form lines\", he laughed, and took my order immediately. I got a lot of dirty looks from the tourists, but ultimately really appreciated his service.   I got a slice of The Vegan ($4.95) and a bottle of water ($3), which is actually reasonable considering the location. The slice was topped with a generous layer of vegan cheese, which was fully melted and had great authentic mozzarella flavor. The roasted veggies on top were slimy and overcooked, but the perfectly crisp, savory crust  made up for it. I would come back here if I am in the area, but would not go out of my way.",

Their ranch is also super good - not the fake kind - it's the thick goodness and yes, sometimes they charge for it but it's worth it.   The workers are always quick and efficient - there's not much seating and I wish the slices were a little bigger for the price but it's comparable to the by the slice at Pizza Rock just down the street.   I'm a big fan of the supremo and garlic knots. I know there's a ton of pizza places downtown but this is a great place to get a slice and it's right by the doors so it's not as smoky from the casino. The slices are larger than your typical, thin crust, and they heat it up for you.   I've definitely ate twice here this week and will probably be back again soon!",

    "text": "So,  someone told me the local paper rated this place the number one pizza place in Vegas. After visiting this place on a Saturday afternoon, I can emphatically state that paper is lying! I ordered two pepperoni slices that were sitting out on the counter. My wife ordered two cheese slices with mushrooms and onions, but they did not have olives! After a seemingly interminable period in the oven, the slices were handed to us. Three pizza is as dry and flavorless as they look in the attached pics. What an extreme disappointment. Add to that the sound of unnecessarily loud rap music piped overhead, and this place is a definite hard pass. After extensive research and expense, I can honestly assert the number one pizza place in Vegas is Amano in northwest Vegas, and number two is undisputedly Dom Demarco's on W Charleston. The high reviews for this place have got to be the result of a scarcity of late night food options and tons of alcohol. If you're downtown without a car, walk on over to Pizza Rock, unless you just don't care about flavor. Oh, and our 4 slices of pizza and two bottles of water set us back twenty bucks! Avoid!",

Last night my wife and I had an inexplicable pizza craving, so I made the trek from The Ogden down to the Plaza, dodging tourists, Elvis impersonators and vagrants to get some delicious slices. This was our fourth or fifth time having Pop Up and it has never failed to impress. We had four slices - an 18b (plain cheese and basil), a Goodman (with potatoes!), some kind of white cheese slice and a tasty, tasty monstrosity with sausage, pepperoni and bacon.  The white cheese and spinach slice was a tad boring, but we devoured the other three, along with the amazing parmesan garlic fries. Pop Up kicks the crap out of the \"secret\" pizza place at Cosmo and shows those strip titans how we do things downtown.",

And even though the worker had 5 pizzas sitting out on the display counter cut and ready to be sold, he told me come back in 20 minutes. There was also a lady waiting. So, he lost out on $30 minimum of profit because he wouldn't sell the pizza that was ready - BTW, if his 20 minute wait was correct, that means he would be open 10 minutes late according to the shop hours. Thank goodness they have other food choices at the hotel so I ate in the food court and gave them my money. I mean I could of ordered Pizza Hut and it would of got there faster than his 20 minute wait rule but the food court was awesome.",

The pizza-by-the slice is actually a bit expensive by my Canadian standards (I think a slice is like $4) but the pizza is great and the toppings are excellent. The cinnamon donut things and the garlic bread are both fantastic and much much cheaper.  After chatting with the staff, we actually ended up buying all their remaining pizza (about two pies' worth) at closing time for $8. We even got a couple of free beers for giving away two slices to some homeless guy.",

Located inside the Plaza Hotel at the end of Fremont Street is a small, tucked away pizza place called Pop Up Pizza. HANDS DOWN, the BEST PIZZA money can buy on Fremont, if not Vegas.  Your experience might be different from mine but here's how it worked. You see the pizza you want through the glass plus anything you see on their menu.  At first I thought they were going to cut out a slice from what has been sitting out in the open.  Instead, the four of us waited and received FRESH PIZZA SLICES from the oven, three different kinds of slices.  Were they amazing?  You bet your A$$ they were!  MAYBE it was because it was slow when we arrived, that might explain why they had the time to make fresh slices for us.  Who knows?  The service of course was friendly and warm welcoming.  It's sad, the more I think about it, the next time I visit Vegas, there is no way that I am going to miss out on Pop Up Pizza.  The pizza here is simply amazing, affordable, and satisfying.",

I stayed at the Plaza this past week and found this little gem the last night we were there. Wish I would have found it earlier. I ordered the 20 piece chicken tenders for bf and I to share and was happily surprised at the price of about $18 with tax. We got them plain with buffalo and teriyaki sauce on the side. The man who was taking our order was super helpful and patient while we tried to decide what to order. Our order was ready in about 10 minutes and was fresh and hot. The tenders were a decent size and the sauces that accompanied them were good as well. The ranch is homemade and <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.com&s=bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bomb.com</a>. I am very picky about ranch and this one was up to par. We had lots of chicken leftover i just wish we had a damn refrigerator we could have put them in to eat the next day, but that was no fault of PUP. Im excited to go back and try their pizza.",

    "text": "When you can give out a 5 star review for reheated pizza, you know it's got to be good! After finally realizing this place is inside the Plaza (don't even ask) we weren't expecting this to be a order a slice, reheat and sit down type of place. There were around 15 tables, a couple businessman eating and the rest was open. Seating wasn't an issue. My first slice I went with your basic cheese, this way I can get a good feel of the crust & cheese. This was pure pizza perfection. The crust was so perfect, just cripsy and not too thick, not too thin. I was so in love, I was scared to try to my second slice because I didn't want to be disappointed. It was anything but, I went with a white pizza, the Plaza, it had mozzarella, ricotta cheese, roasted red peppers and italian sausage. Nice bit of oilve oil on top as well. I couldn't eat this fast enough because my 2 friends (who only ordered one slice) were trying to steal my crust! I could eat just the crust and be happy, it was that good. The ranch dressing was also good (don't hate, I'm a dipper). This place has given my other fav, Cugino's, competition for best crust in town. Well done Pop Up!",

    "text": "One look at the menu and I was ready to tough out the parking woes of going to the Plaza. You can order any pizza by the slice or so it seems. Upon ordering we were told many of our selections were not available. The cashier said the Newport was very similar to the vegan selection, the Soho. I tried it but quickly realized that vegan pizza is nothing like real pizza. The cheese is visually unsettling, like playdoh. The crust was dry and flavorless. I was sad to consume my evening calories this way. Luckily they had my other choice, the White Chapel. It was pretty good. Cheesy, roasted spinach, generous chunks of ricotta and a doughy crust. Two slices and sharing a side is enough for one (costs about $11). The side we enjoyed was the fried pickles. They are fried as spears instead of slices. Wait for them to cool or you will pull a searing hot spear from the bread casing. We were bummed the breading was separate from the pickle, but I'm not sure how you fix that. Also when the man said peoples' numbers that night he said it so nonchalantly and quietly that he had to say them many times. Also our re-warmed pizzas were not super hot, just warmed. I think I would have enjoyed it more if they were hot. If you're down here I'd stop by, but it's hard to make a special trip and not be able to order the slices you wanted. I wasn't about to carry a whole pie to my car blocks away. Maybe bring enough friends to enjoy a whole pizza. Hopefully you can agree on one.",

The owner came out and treated us VERY NICE... GREAT GUY, ..... Good crust . perfectly cooked but lacked zing. none of the ingredients really stood out however the cheese was very nice. This place lacks amenities like condiments at the table, better service from a waitress, not such loud music and serve the pizza on an aluminum plate. I would say this is the best pizza within a 7 mile radius. I would have no problem buying a pie here and sharing with friends while partying on Fremont street.The small size pizza was enough for two of us and they have good beer on tap. I would rate this one of the top 4 NY style, thin crust pizzas in LV and I have been reviewing and tasting NY style pizza places in LV consistently for the last 14 months. Bottom line....... I'll be back....... some ingredients like fresh garlic and meatballs aren't listed as available toppings but the owner said he offered them. Give this place a try..... you won't be dissapointed!",

The first time I came in and ordered a simple slice of pizza by myself after walking through the Fremont Experience. I ended up meeting the manager who embraced me in a quality conversation and made me feel as though I was at home with a friend enjoying some wonderful pizza. The second time I came, i brought a friend of mine to see what he thought. He ended up ordering 3 different types of pizza and loved all of them. Best part about the second experience was that the manager approached me and remembered my name. I was very impressed and will continue to make it a point to stop by every time I am downtown!",

Thats going to be hard here.  With all of the mom and pop style pizza places popping up here I didn't have high hopes for a joint right inside of a Casino.  It started when I made the phone call. The manager asked what time I would like the pizza ready by.  I imagine they try to time it perfect to assure the freshest possible pizza.  When I arrived the pizza just came out of the oven and as I was paying the manager greeted me with a warm smile.  I took the pizza home where my family was eagerly waiting.  The large is quite big but turns out it was not enough.  This place blew Radio city Pizza and Uncle Joes out of the water.  I hate to say it but wow.  The crust was perfection.  Im very surprised by this and Im still wowed by the service.  This is the place I will be taking friends from now on to show off how cool it is to live downtown",

I didnt give it  all the stars and the front page in the newspaper because it was hard to find.  Ask for more signage.    Keep up the hard work.

That pizza was tasty, crispy, with just the right mix of toppings to cheese to sauce. That pizza was a 5. Then we returned Sunday (5/21) around 2 and ordered another whole pizza (always go with the whole pizzas as they are made fresh) and this pizza was a bit too heavy on the sauce and the cheese was a little heavy as well. It made it a lot more messy to handle and overall not as great as the pie the day before. Probably would score a 3, so the avg of the 2 days was 4. Will definitely be back but will try and remember the pizza chef and try and avoid coming on those days.",

Negative one star only because this place is also hard to get to. If your getting take out you have to either pay for parking, or drive up the parking garage it's free for the 1st hour, but I had to go all the way up to the 2nd to last level around and around and around. I was thinking ugh.. this is so ridiculous... again. The should make it easier to get take out, like they should advertise if you show the valet the receipt they will let you park for 10 mins or so so you can run in get it then go home.  or somehow make it a easier process to get take out. Either way this place is a good place to get vegan pizza eat in or take out. It's inside a casino. To your right after you exit the parking garage elevators in the casino level.",

I know everyone compares it to Secret Pizza, honestly I was WAY too drunk to remember my 3am experience there so I'm not gonna be one to compare the two.  We went here during a visit to the Friday downtown farmers market. The parking at the Plaza sucks. You pay $5 then get it refunded inside. The elevators were creepy. Find parking within a few blocks and take the walk. You'll need it after stuffing your face with the thin NY style pizza,  I went with The Plaza (sausage, ricotta, red peppers, no red sauce) I'd order again and honestly I will return based on this slice. Also went with the White Chapel which was a typical white pizza with spinach. I'm a sucker for ricotta on pizza, but next time I will get one with red sauce because I tasted it with my garlic knots and it was bomb.  My bf had a slice with different meats and eggplant. My homegirl had a slice of pepperoni. Both enjoyed but I don't think either of them has had a pizza in NY or NJ the way I have & they didn't get the appreciation I had for the place. And as mentioned in my tip, the reggae music and genuine service topped it off perfectly.  Loss of star for the stupid parking. I appreciate the downtown casinos getting new good grub, but they need some updating as well. Nasty cigarette smoke is not the business! Ill be back, order in advance and run in while my bf does a loop around the block. See you soon POP UP PIZZA!",

Garlic fries could use a bit more garlic though.  I loved the o-rings that were perfectly breaded w/panko.  I was in Vegas only 2 nights and i ate here twice.

They also have the normal pizza place type foods - chicken tenders, wings, fries, garlic knots... etc.  They are also priced well for being downtown.

The \"roasted\" toppings on my pizza were so overcooked that it was difficult to tell what they actually were. And the garlic knots were burnt, not very garlicky, and way too dense for my liking. I got the pizza that was supposed to have dollops of ricotta but the slice they gave me only had 1.  The crust was so thin that even with a huge slice + 2 garlic knots, I left hungry (and I do NOT need much food to feel full).  Maybe I just came at a terrible time or something, but there was absolutely nothing about this pizza that I liked.",

    "text": "I'm a huge pizza lover and let me tell you, this place does NOT disappoint!  A friend and I came here for lunch after hearing so many wonderful things about it.    Rumor has it, this place imports a lot of stuff from authentic graphical locations around the states.  For instance, they ship their cheese from Wisconsin, rumor also has it they use the same water softener as what's used in New York, ensuring the perfect New York style pizza.  If all that's True, then hats off!!  So the location is a blah.  It's on the south end of the Plaza hotel, at the west end of the Fremont Street Experience.  The place is hard to miss, Pop Up PIZZA sign is HUGE.  There are a few square tables in the area.  You have a glass case with all the pizzas available and a couple of tvs.  It's a small quaint pizza joint in the middle of a downtown casino.  Today, I got a slice of the meatball pizza and a slice of the 5th street pizza.  The total with a bottled water and tax came to $10.  The meatball pizza has slices of Italian meatballs, pieces of basil and olives.  The meatball was perfectly seasoned, the basil offered an herbal refreshment and I love the saltiness of the olives.  The 5th street pizza included pepperonis, sliced mushrooms and caramelized onions.  I LOVE mushrooms on pizza.  Something about that combination makes me smile :)  The pepperonis were sliced differently so it looked homemade.  The taste was out of this world.  Add that with the sweetness of caramelized onions and you got my favorite pizza from this place.  I'm always working and hanging out downtown.  Now that I've found this authentic gem, there's no way this was my last visit.  I think this place needs to be told and shared amongst the world of Yelp.  When you're in downtown Las Vegas, you really need to check this place out.  You will NOT be disappointed!",

    "text": "I liked this pizza...well, I liked it better than some secret place, but to find this pizza stand  it's a kind of an adventure from Fremont street experience, because you have to navigate to the very end of the Plaza casino, and make it pass the tequila popper girls.    If sit on that seat for a while, you might forget why you went to the Plaza.     It's next to the south entrance of the hotel, and has about seven table in front of a pizza display case.    There's a few beer in behind the cashier, and about five different pre-fixed pizzas to choose from, and a few of them are much different that the usual.   Everything is 18 in, and you can purchase it as a whole pie or buy it by the slice.     Well, I choose a pretty strange combo that called the \"Goodman\", which is name after our former Mayor Oscar Goodman.    It had interesting combo of  mozzarella, caramelized onions, mushrooms, spinach, and potatoes.   Surprising, the potatoes worked!    I would ask the counter person to re-heat the pizza a little longer than usual.      Basically, this pizza is somewhat like the secret joints pie, but I enjoyed Pop-up crust, and the cost of slice a lot better at this place.      There so much places to eat around the Fremont street area, but if your craving Pizza in the neighborhood,  Give them a try, it's the best pizza in the area, and it won't hurt your pocket book.",

    "text": "Pizza is like BBQ for me...I like all sorts of styles but they just have to be done well. And like BBQ, pizza is fairly simple but it's that simplicity that makes it very hard to do well. I have scoured the city and been disappointed more than I can recall. This place is a shining gem in what is a murky pool of pizza in Las Vegas.  I was coming home from running errands and pulled into a Mexican restaurant down the road. Noticing the FULL parking lot, it dawned on me that it's Valentine's and I'm single with no make up on. Yeah, it's delivery time. I'm new to living downtown so I had no point of reference on what may or may not be good. So taking a chance after reading reviews on yelp, I ordered up delivery from Pop Up Pizza. So glad I did!  They lost a little bit of that 5th stay because the girl who answered the phone was kinda dim and really couldn't answer questions well. I even had to remind her that she needed my address. I was a great point of concern but I already made the order so I decided to just cross my fingers.  What I got... Personal Size 5th St Pizza...this was definitely an excellent pizza and on the TOP of my list for Las Vegas. There really wasn't anything negative about the pie at all. I do prefer a thinner crust but it wasn't really thick either, so I enjoyed it. I must say that the crust and sauce were definitely done extremely well.   Garlic Knots...everyone kept mentioning them in reviews so I had to try them out. Mine were a touch over done on the bottom but otherwise they are super tasty and I will definitely order he again.  My only other real complaint was the delivery guy. He called me and told me I had to come outside because they don't typically deliver to my address. (Btw, I live probably a mile or so away). He then spent a LOT of time looking at my credit card and ID. I started wondering if they have a problem with thieves or something. It was fairly awkward and uncomfortable.   All in all the pie made up for any hiccups that I ran across in the exchange. I'm glad to know they are close and deliver. I'm looking forward to heading over and checking out the place in person",

So we waded through the madness of the Fremont  St. Experience and finally found them in a corner of the Plaza. When you walk up, it looks like a normal pizza place, with pies sitting out waiting to be consumed by the slice. I was immediately drawn to the white pizza and after reading the menu I knew this was not the run of the mill food court pizza. They are quite inventive with the toppings and very friendly.   I went with the White Chapel, cute name, which was a white slice featuring spinach, garlic, and ricotta. It was pretty fantastic and I definitely would have eaten another slice. It was flavorful, especially the spinach and ricotta, and the crust was crispy, thin, and delicious. My husband had a slice that had bacon, sausage, and pepperoni, a real man pizza. It was also very flavorful and delicious, you were really able to discern the flavor of each meat in every bite. I kept stealing bites each time he turned his head. We also tried a slice of the Goodman, which features spinach, potatoes, caramelized onions, and mushrooms. This was good, but not as outstanding as the other slices. We also had some garlic knots, which were good, but nothing too special.  Overall, this place is dishing up some great NY style pizza with inventive toppings. The sauce, the toppings, and the crust are all highlights to these pretty outstanding pies. This is drunk food, with some serious flavor!",

The crust was almost burnt but that's how I like it so I had no complaints. It was much better than the average pizza from the various, big delivery chains.   The Price: the price was a little outrageous. For two slices, our bill came to about $9, which just seems a little crazy for pizza. It was great but I don't think it was THAT great. The slices are huge so that helped justify the price A LITTLE bit.  Overall, this place is really good. The pizza I had was a good size and tasted good. It was cooked perfectly too, when you'd bite into it, all of the cheese and toppings wouldn't come off in one huge, messy piece. I would definitely come back here and I would recommend this place if you have a craving for pizza and you're in or near the Plaza.  Update: today we had the buffalo wings and they were delicious. Especially for a place that doesn't specialize in wings. I could literally eat a vase full of them. Sooo good.",

    "text": "Oooooh, this is good pizza!  I have got a ton of pizza spots bookmarked and rarely get to them. Mainly because I've really got to be in the mood for it and that doesn't happen often. Pop Up was one of those times that being in the mood for pizza was a good thing!  Pop Up is located in the Plaza Hotel just to the right when you exit from the parking garage elevators. It's a fairly small spot but not hard to see at all. All the pizzas are pre-made and displayed at the front for re-heating, unless requested otherwise.   I went with a slice of The White Chapel and a slice of The Harris Meatball Pie. Even after being reheated, the crust here is fanfriggintastic. If you want to fold it, go ahead...but you're not forced to do so to avoid a sloppy mess all over your hands. In my opinion, it was the perfect texture/consistency, whatever you want to call it, for a pizza crust. The toppings are great too and they aren't skimpy with them either! I'm assuming some of these pizzas may sit here a while sometimes but all the toppings were fresh and full of flavor. Plus, how can you complain about a pizza that's described as being topped with \"dollops\" of ricotta?! I know I can't.  If you're in the Plaza for whatever reason, this is definitely worth the stop! The prices are great too...for 3 slices of pizza, 3 drinks and some garlic knots, we only spent about $18. Pop Up Pizza, you will be seeing me again!",

Take out your fucking valley map, with accompanying protractor, and try to prove me wrong.   *waves fist*   I want to take this opportunity to send a direct message to the Edwin P. of the past:   The present-day Edwin is very disappointed in your previous 3* review of this magnificent business. When time travel is discovered, developed, and made reasonably priced and safe, the future Edwin will come back to visit you and beat the shit out of you. Word is bond. Praise Science.   The Plaza is delicious: my absolute favourite. The Harris is bombastically bombdiggity as well. The Oscar makes me want to be Irish. The SoHo has grown on me (especially reheated: I believe the trick is the reheat [Pro Tip]). The Fremont is a bit schizophrenic (like me!). I have never tried the 18B or A or whatever the fuck pepperoni is called. This is all off the top of my head, assholes!   Order the number one combo and get two slices -- Any slices! -- and a drink for 8.64$, tax included. Dude, the drink is refillable. Refillable! What else do you need? I said: What else do you need!  I come here too much. I need help. - E   Postscript. An administrative note: although Pop Up takes credit and debit cards now, AMEX is not accepted.

    "text": "My sister has been talking my ear off about how BOMBdotCOM Pop Up Pizza is. One night we found ourselves being hipsters on Fremont East. What's more hipster than Vegan Pizza (craft vegan microbrews, but I digress), I opened up my faithful Yelp app and saw that PUP was open until 2 AM, we decided to part ways with our friends around 1:15 AM and found ourselves at PUP around 1:30 AM.  Seeing as it was the wee hours, they only had two slices of the Soho their vegan pie that has won my sister over and her bragging rights to what's hip in the food area (which is my usual bragging rights - sibling rivalry never dies). So we got one slice of the Soho and one slice of the Newport.  The Newport is ricotta, artichoke, peppers, eggplant, spinach and mushrooms topped with a garlic infused olive oil. IT was delicious, not overly decadent and tasted really fresh (which is important). I hate when a pizza joint has canned anything on it. I was impressed. I devoured that first slice. Then, I ventured on to the Soho. Vegan mozzarella, spinach, mushrooms, artichoke, and roasted bell peppers... I sized this bad boy up... Then I took a bite. How the heck is the VEGAN pizza soooo damn good and better than the NON-VEGAN options? IT WAS OFF THE CHARTS, y'all. I see why my sister was so sad that they only had two slices (for each of us)left. Needless to say, I cannot wait to go be a hipster downtown and end my night with a slice of vegan pie.  Well done, Pop Up Pizza. You've won me over. I'll be hghi-fiving yo' pie soon!",

I can't really comment on the food but I wanted to share my experience using their delivery service. I found this place here on yelp. Looking forward to finding a new place for pizza. I place my order online. I was called within minutes to confirm the order, they told me it was going to be an hour. I said no problem and waited.. after an hour nobody showed up.. I called to get a status. They simply said sorry its already out for delivery. Thinking it may show up any minute I waited.... another 30 mins later still nothing. Im only a mile away. Called again same ol story they gave me an insincere apology, which is why I didn't want to wait any longer. Im starving and can't leave because they are still on the way... maybe?? With making no effort to earn a new customer just seem they rather get me off the phone to take more orders. Having to repeatedly call with no kinda real info or eta when ill ever get my food. I canceled my order and went to find somewhere else to eat. Which defeated the reason why I wanted delivery. If I had knew it would be this frustrating or this long I wouldn't have ordered. They are quick to charge my card but getting food another story. Im sure they have wonderful food but ill never know. They have left a bad taste in my mouth. So if you give them a chance don't make it for delivery.",

Not sure whether it was the heat, the amount of walking, or the obnoxious crowds, but my hANGRIness set in about 1/4 into Fremont Street. I hadn't known it was located inside the plaza (despite my map going directly INTO the hotel, so we made one wrong turn before I called to ask where they were located. We ordered one of their specials--two slices of pizza and a large drink for 7something. I had the White Chapel and my man had the Plaza. I was pleasantly surprised as how crisp the crust was and how good it was. I've heard the comparison between Pop Up Pizza and Secret Pizza, and I must say it was pretty close. I still have to pay a few more visits here to try their red sauced pizzas and a fresh out of the oven pie. I am also anxious to try their other types of pizza as the White Chapel kind of lacked in the flavor department... Could've been the Ricotta cheese. Either case, this lover of excessive cheese on my pies, I cannot wait to return.",
