Winner winner chicken dinner! The famed potted bread was a bit dry probably not the freshest, but it was now noon so I'm not mad at it)  Prices: standard ($24 after tax and 10% discount for 2 and a coffee with standard American breakfast portions aka BIG) **10% OFF when you post their food on some form of social media!

I'm new to the Vegas area so always on the hunt for a good restaurant.  I had some (southern) family come visit so figured that this would be the perfect time to try it out.  There were 7 of us that arrived around 11 on a Friday morning.  As any great restaurant/dinner should be, they were packed out.  We only had to wait about 5 minutes and the lady at the cash register was super nice.    Once seated, we were immediately greeted and got our drinks only moments later.  Everyone decided quickly what they were going to eat so we got down to business.  Our choices ranged from breakfast items to kids meals to the crazy awesome french dip sandwich.  Our food didn't take long to arrive and we were all surprised by the amount of food that came out.  Everyone had more than enough to eat and between the 7 of us, we managed to finish off everything.  The pancakes are to die for!  Kids loved the grilled cheese sandwiches, chicken tenders and the chicken nuggets.  And they all loved that the fries came in a \"frying basket\" for each plate.  The service was great.  Our drinks were never empty and we were checked on several times during our meal to make sure everything was great.   The menu gives a great variety of choices and we will definitely be back to try something different minus the 4 kids under 7 we were accompanied by originally. Between the 7 meals, 7 sodas/teas and a couple of extra add ons, our meal totaled $68.  Considering the amount of food we consumed, that was a great $68 spent.",

Outside on the window they proudly present themselves as \"best of Vegas\", but  not since 2006, and those 9 years show...  The 'thing' I ate was featured on a TV show, and was interesting, but poorly executed. It had almost no taste, just a lot of \"meh\". The fries were dusted with powdered sugar, which made no sense, and mostly made a mess. It needs spices, herbs, crunch, and more to salvage.  Price would have been OK, if the food had been OK. Service was fine, although there was some ruckus in the kitchen that was rather noisy. I had to ask for a refill, it wasn't offered, and I got it just before I left.   In a couple of years, unless they get their act together, this will be on Restaurant Impossible...",

Not only in plain but you can choose from cinnamon raisin and the special of the week.  And this week was Spice and More...which I will not disclose the detail of it but all I will say is, you must head on over there and try it!  I ended up ordering the ordering Babalama omelet instead of the Sandy omelet, as there was there was the  SOUR CREAM in the Sandy's omelet.  But the rest same, loaded with bacon, avocado, tomatoes, and melted Cheddar cheese.  OMG, it was so delish!  I ate so fast that  I ate so fast my tummy was telling me to slow down!  Pot bread comes with pot bread already and your choice of potato fries or hash-browns.  I choice the hash-browns.    The rest of my part choose the chicken fried steak with three eggs, your choice how preparation, and a Provencal Cheese omelet with fresh diced tomatoes, spinach and provolone cheese.    This is definitely a place worth trying and repeating all over again!  Great staff and your coffee is always full!  CAUGHT'CHA READING!!!",

Today he ordered his usual skillet and mentioned that he was gluten intolerant. The server screwed up her face and told us that none of them including the chefs had been trained to handle allergens. She acted like she wanted us to leave. What the heck???  There are three possible explanations for this change.  1. The server isn't willing or able to deal with allergies. 2. Management has had a change of heart and is no longer willing to deal with dietary restrictions. 3. The chefs really haven't been trained to handle allergies.  All of these options are disturbing.",

    "text": "I love this place!  It's always busy, which is a good sign.  The service is always quick and no-nonsense, which I also like.    I would have given 4 stars, but some of their food is not consistent.  I've had their Cuban sandwich, which ended up being super dry pork.  It felt like the sandwich was just dry pork and bread, when a Cuban sandwich typically has pork, ham, swiss, pickles and mustard.  Maybe they were having an off day that day, because their menu states the sandwich ingredients as such.  Their signature salad - the Jamms salad is cabbage, almonds, green onions, and sesame dressing is absolutely amazing!  It's light, crunchy and not over-dressed.  Very very good.  The corned beef hash and eggs is fatty fantasticness.  Their chilaquiles special sounded amazing, but was far from it.  It was under-seasoned, and loaded with tons of cheese.  Some may think that's a good quality, but this time it wasn't.  I wanted to taste the chips, eggs, and sauce, and the gobs of cheese made that difficult.  The beans that accompanied the dish looked as if they had gone way past their hold time, with the crunchy, crusty bits that form on the pan when they've sat there too long.   Their pot of bread is their signature, and they do that perfectly!  It's got that fresh-out-of-the-oven temperature and smell, and when you pull it apart, it reveals light, pillowy, steamy deliciousness.      All of these dishes were had over a couple visits.  I'll definitely go back to Jamms, but I'll get something different every time to figure out what's good and what isn't.  Right now their signature items (salad, and pot of bread) are the front-runners.  The ambience is homey, but clean.  Service is very attentive, and there's free gum at the checkout stand!",

    "text": "I was not impressed with this place at all today. First we get there around 12:30 and they say 15 minute wait. No problem. We wander over to the vape shop next door. I go back about ten mins later and our table is ready, but they won't seat me as my whole party is not there. Whole party??? It's just me and my boyfriend. I tell them he's right next door and will be back in a minute but they still refuse to seat me. I guess that is just their policy, but it put a bad taste in my mouth and everything got worse from there.   Our server while nice, messed up our order. I wanted to try the weekly pot O bread, which was strawberry almond, but she brought me out cinnamon raisin. Womp womp. I ended up just eating it, because I don't like to complain. It was pretty good though. Boyfriend ordered a Philly with no mushrooms, and it came out with shrooms. She admitted that was her mistake and offered to correct his sandwich, but he decided to order something else instead. He chose a chili burger. This was the smallest burger ever and you could tell the chili came from a can. I ordered the eggs benedict with home fries. I got about 2oz of home fries, which are potatoes with bell pepper and onions. They were good, but I had two bites and they were gone. The hollandaise on my eggs did not have much flavor, so the whole dish suffered.   I paid just about $30 including tax and tip which is wayyyyy too much for just an ok meal. I probably won't be back.",

We tend to visit here at least twice a month, usually on Sunday mornings (which is kind of a mistake because that's when after church crowd tends to swarm it) so there's always a wait, but believe me it is worth it.   The omelettes are nice, big and fluffy and the home fries are just right. The orange juice is delicious (I'm not sure if they claim its fresh-squeezed, but I have my doubts). The coffee isn't spectacular, but definitely passable.   One of the things that set Jamms apart: a rotating variety of \"pots o' bread\" (Management: If you're reading this, PLEASE make the cheddar jalapeno pot o' bread a permanent menu item!) - ranging from season flavors to standard fare.   But what I love more than anything is the service. From the hostesses, to the bus people, waitresses and waiters, everyone is friendly and treats you like family. There are seriously staff members who are genuinely happy to see you week after week.   That's what keeps this place going strong; nothing fancy or fussy, good food and great service.",

We drove a little ways from our side of town and would do it again to come back here!  It's a cute little place in a strip mall off of Rainbow & Charleston. Upon entering, we were immediately greeted and seated. Our drink orders were taken, literally the second we sat down. Our very cheerful and friendly server asked to take our orders very soon after our drink orders were taken. Being this was our first time here, we needed a couple of minutes.  I ordered the veggie omelet and my cute husband had bacon and eggs. I really liked that the food was NOT greasy! The omelet was huge and stuffed with perfectly sauteed veggies. I had home fries that were seasoned just right, AND I really liked the fact that they didn't drench my toast with butter! My toast had just the right, even spread of butter, which is rare.  All in all, the service was great, the food was very good, and the prices were pretty much average to most other places. I would definitely make the trek to have breakfast here again.",

I took a surprisingly lengthy (twss) and expensive round trip cab ride way out on Rainbow rd where you could still kinda see the strip but it was still $30 away. Anyway, after passing the strip mall where this place sits a few times, cabbie found it and I settled up to the counter in a surprisingly empty restaurant (well it was about 3pm on a weekday). A very friendly waitress greeted me and the french toast I ordered was well worth the journey. If you haven't had corn flake french toast before, this is a good place to try it. Perfectly cooked on some good bread and quite tasty. The corn flakey crunch adds so much to the french toast experience, you may never make french toast the same again. Awesome.",

Scored some major points there cause I guzzle soda!! I ordered the home fries as well bc the pics looked sooo yummy!! I was dissapointed that they came out as little chopped up bits of seasoned potatoes with peppers and onions...did I order the wrong thing? I'm confused on what the potatoes are in the yelp review pics that look like they are super crispy on top, almost looked like a mound if mashed- are they the breakfast potatotes? The guy next to me had a dif style but they still looked shredded. Either way the pancakes were amazing, little crispy on the side and barely needed any syrup they were so tasty. They are def the buttery version as opposed to a dryer type like at maple tree, cracked egg and weiss deli. I will def be back to try and get those potatoes. Very friendly atmosphere....would have been 5 stars had I gotten the right homefries!",

We were greeted by a very pleasant lady and seated at a booth. Immediately we were served our coffee. A very nice waitress came to take our order as soon as we got the coffee. After she answered some questions she put our order in. They have seasoned home fries, and sweet potato fries.i had the sweet potato fries. They sprinkle them with powdered sugar, they were yummy. They serve them in a little fryer basket. They also have the original bread bowl. It's bread made in a little muffin cup, the bowl. They have white, wheat, and cinnamon raisin. I loved the cinnamon raisin. They didn't keep my coffee cup full, but did give me a second cup before I left. Over all, the food was great,very original presentation, very pleasant ambiance, service was good with hardly any wait. It's a place you want to return to. Oh, they serve breakfast any time of day. Price for 2 breakfasts for us was $22.00, but you could spend more if you want. Great place to take friends.  I will be a regular.  Dan",

The omelet was hearty and the perfect size. The waffles had fresh fruit toppings, a generous side of syrup and delicious whip cream, but the texture was more of a beignet.  The servers were polite and attentive, specially with coffee refills.  Will return again!",

    "text": "Great comfort food for breakfast or lunch. Jamms restaurant is located on Rainbow and Charleston. I love this mom n' pop restaurant...quaint interior with dated decor that makes you feel at home.   In terms of service and food, I prefer this place over other breakfast places like Egg & I, Egg Works, Original Pancake House, Cracked Egg, and so forth. It's definitely not a healthy breakfast and can be slightly heavy for some but I still like its tasty home cooking. Service can be hit-or-miss with some servers being very attentive while some completely forgetting your existence. Either way, all servers are super friendly and their uplifting spirit will help you start your day on a bright note.   My favorite is Jamms signature omelet ($9.99) which comes with sliced steak, onion, mushroom and cheese topped with bearnaise sauce. I have no idea what bearnaise sauce is but based on Google search, it's a sauce made with butter, egg yolk and wine vinegar. I thought it was similar to gravy but it was more fragrant because of herbs. Tip is to ask for sauce on the side because they give you a lot. This omelet is meaty, cheesy and filling, easily my top favorite here.   French dip ($9.99) is another meaty/filling dish that comes with generous slices of roast beef. These slices of beef are in stack of three to four and comes in a hero roll. Their au jus was little different from what I had expected and almost felt like it was a french onion soup. I was surprised that I actually liked the sandwich without dipping in their au jus.   Philly cheese steak ($9.79) is nothing special here. I wouldn't order this unless you are craving philly cheese steak.   Pot of bread is free with Yelp chek-in. You can get the original, cinnamon raisin or special of the week. On my recent visit, I redeemed my check-in offer for their peaches and cream pot of bread. Bread itself was doughy and had small chunks of peaches inside. Cream cheese was provided on the side.   Inarguably one of the best breakfast joint in town. I hope to keep coming back here for many years ahead.",

Not sure if the 2 hostesses on duty on Sunday 02.11.2018 have any vested interest in the operation, but they sure know how to be rude and unwelcoming, did I mention inconsistent / biased in the way they apply the seating policy. I have read some great reviews about this place and I will make sure that I extensively share my experience so none of my friends / acquaintances ever gets subjected to the embarrassment I had to face.",

    "text": "DOG LOVERS BEWARE: On a scorching hot day, I was stranded in a plaza for four hours. I came in with a bowl and asked the front desk waitress if I could use the sink in the bathroom to fill the bowl for my two year old dog, Egypt, a sweet and loving two year old pitbull, that was suffering from dehydration. She said no. I said the dog is in pain. She said that the restrooms were for customers only, no exceptions. I said you must hate dogs. She said no. I said fine but asked to speak to the owner/manager to tell them that this decision is wrong. The waitress went to her and said there's a guy who wants tap water from the restroom for his dog. The owner/manager snapped at her: NO! Then I stepped in and said that's fine I will respect your rule but that you are wrong and should consider certain situations as they come. Then - THE BEST PART: A customer overheard the whole thing, grabs the fully iced water glass on her table, gets up from her chair and fills my bowl. It was priceless and so satisfying. She made me proud. I thanked her and walked away with what I came in to get without saying another word. And EVEN BETTER: the place was packed and the customer's action made the room stop. The way the owner/manager yelled NO! grabbed everyone's attention. And another positive outcome: I put the bowl next to Egypt as I sat next to my car where I was stranded in 111 degree weather, and customers started coming out and filled her bowl with thier iced glasses! A beautiful act of protest. There are still many blessed people in the world.  And yes, this is a review based on emotion and how my dog was cruelly treated. The only thing I can comment about the restaurant itself was that the atmosphere was 4 out of 10 with bad lighting and the vibe as I walked in was one of negativity. I hope this makes someone's day, or changes someone's apathy towards needs of dogs. I had to get this off my chest. Peace and love to all who read this.",

    "text": "I'm a fan of their food, just not a fan of the slow service. When I first moved out here, Jamms was our go to breakfast/brunch because my boss loved this place.  At the time, we loved it too because we knew that our breakfast or brunch would take at least an hour of our work day.  The wait and the service usually takes awhile.  On my last visit, the wait was better and the our food came out faster.  But it still took a while, in my opinion.    As for their food, there's a big selection of your typical breakfast items.  Price is actually pretty good and taste is not too bad.    My Past Orders: -Jamms Signature Omelet:  This is the king of all omelets here.  Steak and mushrooms dominate this omelet.  This is all you need because you are definitely stuffed after eating this one.   -Chicken Fried Steak & Eggs:  Actually my favorite dish here.  Their chicken fried steak is tender and the batter is not too heavy.  Portions are huge as well.   -Jamms French Toast:  Their french toast has a different look to them. I always thought that they were over-cooked, but they're not.  The french toast is crispy on the outside and after it's drenched in syrup, soft in the inside.  My second favorite.  -Steak & Eggs:  I had this on my most recent visit and can only say...stick with your favorites.  The steak had no taste and was a bit too dry.  I felt like I was eating cardboard.  But then again, stick with your favorites when you come here.    Overall, Jamms is just okay.  With all the other breakfast joints in our beautiful city, it's tough to say that Jamms ranks above them all.  But if you're looking for a decent breakfast with a lot of options, Jamms is the way to go.   YELP PERSONAL CHALLENGE - (056/366)",

Disappointed about that, but I ended up going for the chicken and waffles which turned out to be really good. My friends ordered burgers and said they were good too.   So the food was pretty good, but the service was slowwww. The restaurant wasn't even half full, but the waitress barely visited us and when she did, her visits were short and she was very quick to leave, like she wanted to be somewhere else all the time.   All in all, food was yummy, service was bad (lady at the front was nice though), and the price was about $10 each person. I give it a 3/5.",

    "text": "This one was a recommendation from a co-worker at Century 21, yes years ago- we ordered breakfast items several times on a group order. It was very good. I never forgot it and had always wanted to go in person. We were on that side of town and since the Red Apple Grill wasn't open for lunch, this was Plan B. I had never been inside until last saturday, with my husband. It's a small but busy and popular restaurant located at a strip mall next to Albertson's on the corner of Rainbow/Charleston. There was a short wait- I gave my name. It was about five minutes or so. Not bad. My husband said it reminded him of a smaller version of The Cracked Egg. It was decorated for Halloween. We sat in a booth- I was facing their Wall of Fame- numerous \"Best of Las Vegas\" awards, as well as a travel site award.  The drinks were brought over to us pretty quickly (quick refills too BTW). We ordered from the lunch menu- Reuben & Jamm's Philly (with mushrooms, and onions)- and split it (our usual MO). Your choice of side- fries, sweet potato fries, potato salad. All sandwiches came with lettuce, tomato, and pickles- cut generously. Most items on the lunch side were priced at $8.50 on average. We both got the sweet potato fries- very generous helping (next time, my husband said one of us will get the fries and the other will get something else). Both sandwiches were equally very good. Not super greasy either, which can be the case with both sandwiches. (We saw a sandwich that was going to another table that was super stuffed- wonder what that was, but I don't know how that person could even open his/her mouth- would have to take out an inch of meat from it. It was that big.) My husband liked this place; he recommended it to his mom and step-dad. I'm sure we will be back again. The staff is warm and very friendly- I noticed that there were regulars here (a good sign).   The bill was $17 and change- pay at the front counter. Free gum at the counter. On a side note, we noticed that there are omelets named after us, our nick names anyway, and they're right next to each other- how funny. Never saw that before in a menu, so we thought it was cute. Good diner on this side of town, reasonable prices, fast/friendly service, cozy atmosphere, only open until 3 pm.",

Jamm's has been a voted favorite for awhile and I can see why. But there is always room for improvement.  On the first trip, I ordered the Provencal omelet. It came with spinach, tomatoes, and cheese. The omelet was very soggy probably because of the main ingredients, but it should never be presented to the customer in the way that it was. It looked more like soup. I have to add, I never appreciate places that put a slap of cheese on top to melt. It tastes better when inside the blanket of egg.   The pot of bread, which this place is known for is a cool idea. However, if they want to make a pot of gold serving the carb in a cup, they need to perfect the recipe. It's dry.   Second trip, I ordered the turkey melt on texas toast. It was good. Just make sure you ask for dry toast if you don't like it to be buttered up.   This place is one of the better breaksfast joints in town. With a few quick improvements it could be even better.   3 1/2 stars.",

The restaurant is located in a strip mall location and looks like a good find when you search for it.  There was a long line for a wait and the locals told me I would not be disappointed when I questioned the 20 min wait before a flight so I stayed with my friends who are locals.  The wait wasn't too long ..our server took a bit of time getting to us because they were busy ...my fresh cup of coffee (there's a portion on the menu that says that we all deserve it to be fresh) was never refilled ...after I asked for it it came as I was almost done with my meal.  My gauge of a good breakfast is always a Benedict ...I've had multiple variations of it and it's my go to ...must be the sauce ....the menu talked about how you should get turkey if you want it but I guess it only applies to sausage and not bacon ..no beef or pork for me.  I opted for the Benedict with spinach ..egg was ok ..I asked for over medium and it came out over easy ..don't like it when the egg white is still liquid ...the hollandaise was average - nothing extra added to it and the spinach fairly bland.  I did order the bread in a tin and that was decent - I got to sample the plain, raisin and finally red velvet - the cook on each was different and I did finish the bread the only part of my meal that I polished along with the coffee.  I'm pretty limited in some of the things I can eat so when there's an item on the menu that excites me and its executed well I am pleased.  Social media is definitely something this restaurant does well and I think it contributes to their awards and recognition because the food is ok just like any other standard breakfast place out there.",

Amazing omelets, chewy super cheesy (the way I personally like them) The bread pots are like risen pots of yeast heroin. If I think too much about the bread pot I'll be right back there tomorrow morning consuming my entire day's  calorie consumption on multiple bread pots with the addictive cream cheese topping. They keep the coffee filled and the food out fast. Been coming here for over a year while out monthly for work and has been consistently excellent!",

Be prepared to wait in line on the weekends, especially Sunday.  The line does move pretty quickly though and it is worth the wait.  It is pretty small inside so it does get a bit noisy, not a huge deal for us.  The staff is always warm and friendly and makes you feel welcome.",

Although I wish the broccoli had been cooked a little more, it was delicious. The pot of bread was different and scrumptious. Parking is convenient and plentiful, since there is a grocery store a couple doors down. Decor was OK, but very clean,  booths looked a little circa 1980's. Honestly the only thing I wish they'd change is the kids menu prices, they seemed a bit high. Will definitely go back again.",

    "text": "Items ordered:  Coffee Nutella Almond Pot of Bread Red Velvet Pancake S'mores Pancake McBeth - French Toast, Ham, Turkey, Swiss Grits  Another long-term fixture of the local food scene, and one I'd unknowingly been driving by twice daily every Thursday and Friday since relocating to Las Vegas, Jamms Restaurant quickly earned a spot on the 'to-visit' list when my server at Mary's Hash House mentioned the quaint local eatery as another \"great place\" serving up home-style breakfasts at a fair price - a 7am opening perfect for another Saturday of dining.  Nondescript from the exterior but cozy and kitsch inside as a friendly staff bounced between tables with endless refills of coffee from Illy at a mere $2.75 it was to a diverse menu and a hot, yeasty 'pot of bread' slathered with Nutella and toasted almonds that I arrived and after perusing the menu at length an order was placed, a server named Shirley warning me that it would be \"a lot of food,\" but failing to inform me of noted upcharges of $2 for a single Red Velvet Pancake and $1.25 for grits in place of potatoes.  Jovial in spirit with tunes ranging from Sinatra to Madonna playing overhead it was perhaps a ten minute wait after the bread that the rest of my meal arrived and with each item larger than expected in size it was indeed a substantial breakfast with only the cocoa-less Red Velvet failing to impress...the flavor merely that of a decent buttermilk pancake gussied up with $2 in dye.  Speaking to the rest, suffice it to say that it would be hard to mess up something as decadent as the signature \"S'Mores\" with ample chocolate chips and chocolate syrup finding balance in bold buttermilk, marshmallows, plus a dollop of whipped cream and yet as good as the pancake was, the un-fried riff on the Monte Cristo easily stole the show as golden Texas Toast dipped in custard housed Ham, Turkey, and Swiss of good quality and quantity, all just waiting for a sweet gilding of maple syrup to make flavors pop.  Never one to quibble prices but a firm believer that upcharges should always be disclosed Jamms strikes me as a good-enough place in a city with plenty of similar options; a bit better than some and a bit worse than others...the sort of place I'm sure to revisit at some point for the Waffle Sundae or the Stuffed French Toast, but not before investigating other family owned spots or before second visits to Blueberry Hill, Hash House, Egg & I, or Baby Stacks.",

They were attentive and did an awesome job at making sure we had everything we needed.  This rating is based on my meal.  I had a French toast combo and decided to go with the Jamms French Toast.  It was very tasteless and needed something sweet to give it a wake up call.  Had the chef done that, I would be giving this a 5 star.  Otherwise, the rest of our breakfast was good and my wife really enjoyed the pot of bread!!  I just recommend asking them to sweeten up the Jamms French Toast because I lost my appetite after eating it.",

I had the corn beef hash and eggs, bread pot, hash browns, and toast. The CB Hash is the real deal made from scratch with bit pieces of CB throughout. Eggs were poached and exactly to specification, bread pot was delish!  I was told to pay up front when I was done with my meal and they kept the coffee topped off and offer a stronger blend if you desire.  Yelpers that did not rate this establishment higher need to try it again, because it seems they have listened to your suggestions/complaints and have acted upon those making the needed corrections.  I will return!",

While this place is practically always packed, it's worth the wait. Usually the staff is working very proficiently and the wait isn't even that long. The breakfast food is very good, and they have a few vegetarian options.   The pumpkin pancakes were my favorite when they were in season, but there's plenty other crazy combinations to choose from. The eggs benedict is usually what I get and the sauce is awesome. Yeah, awesome sauce.",

When I was served the sandwich I had to lift the top piece of bread to see the pastrami.    When I eat a rueben I want layers of pastarmi, kraut and dressing slopping out the back of the sandwich when I eat it.

There are many interesting options on the menu, but we decided on the classics. I got the pancake special which comes with pancakes, bacon or sausage, and I eggs. When I asked, they had no problem swapping out the eggs for hash browns. The pancakes were very thick and fluffy, easily the best part of the dish. The bacon was decent sized and just the right crispness. I could have used a little more crispiness on the hash browns, but they were pretty good. My boyfriend got the more super sized version which also came with sausage and a ham steak. The ham steak was average sized, cooked nicely. We got a free pot of break with check-in. We got the weekly special which was rainbow sprinkles. It was soft, flaky, and delicious. This is a great spot for breakfast!",

    "text": "I have been holding this in for sometime now, and I feel it is important information to share. A few weeks ago my husband went to eat breakfast at Jamm's here in Las Vegas. He ordered and ate his breakfast, and then asked if he could order some bacon to go.. With one request, that it be made in a separate pan so that I would be able to eat it and not have to worry about cross contamination. The server said it shouldn't be a problem. However, when she brought it to him she informed him that in the future if he were to order the bacon this way it wouldn't be possible if they were busy. He was floored. He is making sure that his wife doesn't potentially die and apparently this \"special\" request was just to much for the kitchen to handle. Seriously?! So he speaks with the manager and her attitude was so non-chalant that clearly life saving practices are not important. So he gets home, tells me this, and now I am questioning if I should even eat this bacon. I open the container and find not only my bacon but hash brown bits as well. Clearly our request was completely ignored. So I decided to call Jamm's and the manager gets on the phone, and when I inform her that I could die if I ate that bacon her response was, well then just don't eat it. I went off on her. Clearly no concern for their patrons is evident. I want everyone in Vegas to know that if you have a \"special\" request in order to ensure your life isn't jeopardized, won't be taken seriously. It starts at the top people. If management doesn't care then no one else will. I just hope the death of someone doesn't happen due to their carelessness and negligence. I am not asking because I am picky, I am asking because I don't want to die. So please make sure that before you eat there you evaluate their practices. Oh and just so you know no military discount is given, but if you post you are there on social media you get 15% off your bill. Really? I think priorities need to be shifted.",

After waiting for @ 20 min just to have our order taken it was proof then why the wait to sit takes a long time. I think we had more interaction w the bus boy than out waitress. Had to ask for refills which should never happen. Stay on top of your customers please!!! Finally food has been eaten and plates removed and again another long long wait for the check. Over all the service alone will keep us from coming back. No one wants to waste half a day at this. Your staff can be friendly as our waitress was, but when you fail to attend to your customers you fail to get returning ones.",

The pototoes tasted stale, and the sausage in my omelet was dry and looked old. Our waitress felt bad, but I told her it was not her fault, it is the cook staffs fault.

We waited 15 minutes  for a table they were busy but the hostess was a little bitch, she was very rude, I had asked her a question and her replybwaa very rude, but when I asked the question when you have a minute can you, not stop what your doing can you.  Now I dont know if my eggs were cold when I got them but they were cold when I ate them. Both the gran babies loved their grilled cheese and pb&j sandwiches respectively and the hubby devoured his stuffed French toast. So overall it was still a good experience and wont stop us from.c9ming back",

My husband is particular about his pancakes and these guys hit a home run with him. The pot of bread which was an orange citrus was amazing. Fresh and warm, straight out of the oven and to my belly. Yum. We fought over this and should have gotten one each. My veggie omelette was perfectly cooked and enough for myself and my adult daughter. We will definitely hit this place up when we head back to Vegas.",

I ordered the \"chicken BLT green onion waffle\" On their menu it describes it as a crispy chicken breast with bacon tomato lettuce cheese and green onion waffles.  My order came to my table and as soon as I removed the top waffle SURPRISE its chicken finger (McDonald's chicken strips are more bigger than what this people gave me) I was tasting more the lettuce than nothing else.  If you are going to give me a chicken finger as a crispy chicken breast. Change the desperation of your menu.",

I ordered the chicken waffle breakfast with french fries! For $10, I got a full plate, with room for leftovers of delicious goodness! Be sure to check in, and order their pot of bread for free!

We waited about 15 minutes for a table, and another 15 for service, but the waiter kept the coffee coming so the wait was not horrible.

Their menu is big and offers lots of substitution or smaller sized items on their \"red plates\" section of the menu.  Great for someone like me who is often indecisive and overwhelmed by all the decisions.  I decided I wanted to order breakfast food, though they did have many lunch/diner type items as well.  The food was good. I ordered the cinnamon raisin pot of bread as a side since it seems to be popular on the reviews.  It was good, not amazing.  But, nice that it was something different.  The staff was friendly and helpful when I asked questions on the menu, and service was quick.  Very basic interior, nothing IG-picture pose worthy (if you care about that kinda thing, I don't). Only semi-down side was that they don't serve alcohol.  So, no Sunday brunch mimosa for me that day.  Overall, it was a good spot and I would go back.",

It was kind of a check in the box for me, so if nothing else I'm glad to knock another one off the list.   Came here on a Sunday and the line was out the door, which is usually a good indication the food is worth the wait. And surprisingly, the line moved rather quickly. And thank goodness because we were all in desperate need of nourishment after the night out we had. (Note to self: lots of sake, sushi & shots are a recipe for disaster, ugh!) Lol!   Anyways...first impression: it's a very small busy diner that could use some major updating. Lots of noise and hustle & bustle. Sitting near the kitchen I got a good glimpse of the waitresses & cooks frantically trying to get food out. Even so, our food took a bit longer than expected to make it's way to our table but in all fairness it was a Sunday not to mention, Mother's Day. We should feel lucky we were able to get seated so quickly.   On to the food. The pot-o-bread was good, free with your Yelp check-in. I guess that's what they're known for. Nothing here that really stood out to me. The guys seemed to be pleased with their meals. My omelet was just okay. The cheese on top wasn't melted. And the bacon inside seemed a bit over cooked, as were the side of potatoes which made it difficult to eat. (See my photo and you'll understand).   All in all, it wasn't terrible, it also wasn't the best. Great prices so that's a plus. But there are better options for breakfast around town.",

Another Yelper mentioned the coffee being delicious and I'm a picky coffee person, and this was great! Our server was Sandy, and she was very quick to get our orders and very nice. My friend ordered the steak and eggs and I had the pancake combo. We were both happy with our orders and they came out pretty quickly. Sandy topped off our coffee's a few times which I loved. I'm a sucker for great servers who come around when drinks get half way.   I will definitely be back to try other items on the menu and to request Sandy again. Highly recommend this place.

It was amazing!! Food was fantastic and we were a table of 4 adults, 3 kids (6, 4 and 1) and a baby and the kids were seriously happy and ate everything put in front of them (parents will know this is seriously a rare occasion when every child not just eats but finishes their food without an act of Congress.) Awesome find for us locals and a place to take friends and family to in the future, a welcome find by our friends from out of town; sometimes that's what it takes to find greatness right in front of you.",

The second time I went here, there was an estimated wait of 20 minutes. If you're going here for breakfast, make sure you have at least two hours. The staff was friendly, and we were seated in 20 minutes. After we were seated, however, it took probably another 20 minutes for us to have our order taken. This time I got one of their specialty French toasts-- a word of advice, don't bother with the specialty French toasts. Just go with Jamms French Toast. I made the mistake of coming here with only an hour and a half before I had to go to work, and I got my food about two minutes before I had to leave. Immediately I asked for a to go box and left. The food was still good, friendly staff but it took too long. Don't come here during the breakfast rush. It will take an hour and a half to get your food. The pot of bread is delicious, so is the chicken fried steak and Jamms French Toast. It's fried in corn flakes. Classic soul food.",

One of my eggs was hard boiled and the other was perfect. The Hollandaise sauce was basically tasteless. I didn't finish my meal and left the one hard boiled egg - no comment from the waitress. My wife's steak was overcooked (supposed to be medium) and had a strange taste. She ate less than half of her meal. At the check out counter the lady asked how our meals were. I said fair. No comment. I asked about purchasing another cup that I had purchased the last time we were here. I told her that the wording had come off in the dish washer and I wanted one like my coffee was served in - raised printing not just painted on. I was then presumed to be a complainer and she copped an attitude. Her tone changed and I gave up, figuring I wouldn't get anywhere here. Too bad really. You can get a marginal meal anywhere and any time,so it is a shame that she got huffy with me. Oh well !!",

    "text": "Jamms is a great breakfast place.  I found them on Yelp a few years ago and now everytime we come to Vegas, we make it a point to have breakfast here.  I love the pot of bread (use Yelp and you can get a free pot) and the french pressed coffee.  I had never had it before, but always will now.  We haven't tried their lunches yet, but will need to do that on our next trip.  Jamms is a great local place.  I get so tired of the chain restaurants and fighting the traffic on the Strip.  Get in your car and take a short drive to Jamms.  You'll be glad you did.",

The bread was delicious except that the condensation in the pan it was served in made the bottom soggy. Oh we'll. the hash browns were crispy and their homemade hash was simply amazing. Coffee was on point as well. Husband had steak and eggs and was happy with portion and taste. I want to come back and have more before we leave.

I feel that restaurants lack the \"at home\" type of feeling, Jamm's is definetely one of those establishments. As soon as you walk in your greeted with a huge smile and welcome. I waited less than 2 minutes for a seat. Right away we were asked what would we love to drink. Service right away!   The waitress with an absolute contagious smile, was very sweet and helpful. We did not wait for our food no longer than 15 minutes! Awesome, because I get so anxious when it comes to food. I ordered the Sandy Omelette (which I reccomend), DELICIOUS! Goodness, it was GOOD, hey did not skim on the portions of bacon,avacado, cheese and tomatoes.   I strongly reccomend this restaurant!",

Corned Beef Hash and Eggs: NO Question, the Best Corned Beef Hash I've ever had to date!!

The portion was also Generous! The accompanied fried potatoes were far from dry, simple and delicious!  French Toast - \"Jamms Style\" = corn flake breaded/crusted: 4 Thick half slices of toast that were a little crunchy, a little sweet and had a nicely executed spongy consistency. Add some of their softened butter and drizzle some maple syrup over the bits of powdered sugar.. Yummm!!  Pot of Bread: Thanks Yelp for the complimentary/special offer!

It is an unassuming place well away from the strip - so most of the traditional visitors to Vegas won't know about it.   The service is extremely friendly and welcoming as soon as you enter the restaurant.   The type of food served is typically diner-style food. However there are a few things that raise them up to a five-star rating:   1. The service is genuinely friendly 2. The steak and eggs (for breakfast) is great - and arrives very quickly 3. Try the chicken-fried steak. It is to die for! 4. Instead of toast, have the pot of bread. You get an individual loaf that has been freshly baked in its own ramekin. Marvellous!   Obviously when I was there, the waitress must have noticed my enthusiasm for the homemade bread because she brought me a second one (which I dispatched with equal enthusiasm).   Vegas can be a mad place, but it is really nice to stumble across somewhere like Jamms every so often.",

    "text": "Long time lover of this fabulous, down home diner. Haven't been back in quite awhile. Wish I had stayed away. The service and friendly atmosphere is still fully intact. Wonderful, quick service. One start for that alone.   Unfortunately, I think, over the years, they have tried to become something they're not. The menu has exploded with ridiculous, monstrosities for new dishes. They couldn't just add chicken and waffles. They had to create anything and everything with waffles from a BLT on waffles to a waffle pizza. Yes, I said \"waffle pizza.\"  They managed to get a bit of notoriety on the Travel Channel with a crazy breakfast sandwich consisting of a corned beef hash omelet with sauerkraut and Swiss cheese piled on a huge pretzel bun that has been egg battered with cinnamon and sugar then deep fried. Couldn't bring myself to try it.   The last time I visited, Jamm's had been venturing into exotic coffees and cappuccinos. They were heading in the right direction. This visit, the coffee tasted like it had been brewed through the same grounds all day. I could t even finish one cup.   We went with a couple classics that we remember being the best in town the Hash and Eggs and the Country Benedict. The hash would have been fine without the handful of chopped garlic that was clearly tossed in right at the end of cooking. I love garlic, but that much undercooked garlic ruined what was once a breakfast legend. Since they clearly switched their sausage to a poor quality, frozen patty, they must not have had the flavorful sausage drippings and fond leftover to make a decent country gravy.  They changed their home fried potatoes to hash browns with onions and peppers. Which would be fine, but then don't call them home fries. Call them hash browns O'Brien. Of course, that wouldn't be necessary as they still offer hash browns on the menu.   I am not only disappointed, but saddened by the changes this place has undergone since I last visited. This used to be a place where we new the crew and they new what we wanted and you could not pick a bad thing off the menu. I think they just fell victim to chasing the \"foody\" trend and lost sight of what was working so well for them.   I hope they find their way soon. Would love to return to the good 'ol Jamms I remember.",

    "text": "Big breakfast for inexpensive prices is the drawing point of this restaurant in a non gross way. Unlike other places that give you a heaping plate of heart clogging ridiculousness, Jamms has more healthy options. I had ordered the veggie omelet with egg whites and no cheese. That was the health nut in me speaking and then the glutton in me decided that sweet potato fries and a cinnamon raisin pot o bread should accompany with it ($10).    Looking around there were seasoned customers and I knew this place was a winner. When you can get a bunch of older locals into a restaurant and have them enjoy a meal, it must be good.   The omelet was massive, filled with tomatoes, onions, mushrooms, and big chunks of broccoli. The sweet potato fries were plentiful and I made sure to eat them all. The pot o bread was nice and fluffy. I just wished with a name like Jamms, they would have homemade jam. Just nitpicking now.   The staff was nice, split checks were not an issue, and our server was quick with refills.",

I've never had an issue waiting because I'll have my turn.   Today a friend and her daughter joined me for breakfast and before I finished my food they brought me a to go box.  They brought us the bill twice & started cleaning off our table before we were done. Then as my friend's daughter was still working on her pancakes they asked if we were going to order anything else if not then they needed our booth for someone else.  WTF?   Mind you we were there for less than an hour & the people behind me were there before us & were still there after us. No one asked them to leave... such a discriminating feeling. I didn't know that this sit down establishment had a time limit on seating.  Rude service is putting it lightly.  We'll never return!",

Total hole in the wall diner feel with booths.   Ordered the corned beef hash that comes with 2 eggs, hash browns and their famous pot of bread. I got the lemon and blueberry, which was their flavor of the week and it came out piping hot with sweet butter cream. They also have plain and cinnamon raisin daily. Everything was great! Did not disappoint and it was a good size portion. My pot of bread wasn't quite ready with the rest of the order, so she gave me a complimentary cinnamon raisin also.   Next time I'm going to order the home fries instead. It's not the typical diced potatoes, but they were sliced and looked almost like hash. Tasted hubby's and it was good. He ordered the Reuben omelet, my son had a made to order omelet and my other son had the steak and eggs. Everyone enjoyed their meals and said the restaurant was a good choice.

Although it is a tiny location in a strip mall on Rainbow, the wait time was less than fifteen minutes on a Sunday morning. Waiters and waitresses were super attentive and the choice of music for the place was awesome (a lot of Katy Perry, Adele and Ed Sheeran) even though the place was jam packed, you were still able to hear the person sitting across from you and no one was bumping you or your booth.   What did I order? The most amazing skillet ever. It included,  sausage, bacon, the best potatoes possible, eggs, cheese, peppers, onions, all covered in white gravy. Seasoned to perfection and piping hot. Came with a side of perfectly toasted toast (ha, perfectly toasted toast), and I ordered a strawberry covered waffle on the side.   I should not have ordered anything extra because the portions were out of this world.   My boyfriend ordered an omelet which came with sausage, bacon, peppers and a pot o' bread.   That bread...  My god that bread. When they offered it, I should've taken it instead of substituting the toast. My boyfriend inhaled it in a matter of seconds. I was barely able to get a tiny piece. It was just that effing good. No clue what they put in it or how they prepare it, but not only was it toasted and flaky, but when you bit into it, it was rich with flavors I can only describe as heavenly and the feeling in my mouth was simply orgasmic in nature.   GO EAT ALL YOUR MEALS HERE.",

I have the picture to prove it. I later asked him about the promoted material stating that the RRITO comes w pot of bread he said oh no it doesn't. The tortilla is considered the carbs for that?? How is this possible when it states that the RRITO comes with it? So, I needed to order a RRITO w out the tortilla next time?? Just overall mess things not making sense. Used to be go to place now, just an unorganized mess. Never Again when my family and friends come to town!",

The pot of bread was VERY good though. I got two red plates, including blueberry pancakes, which were ok. Not great or terrible. Not a lot of flavor. I also got Matty's Country Benedict. It was better. The \"country gravy\" was like none I've had before. It wasn't bad, just way different. My wife had chicken and waffles, which she said were pretty underwhelming. The presentation was lame: a big waffle on a huge plate with a couple of chicken strips next to it. This is not Hash House or anything like it. Our server was not around much, but the food came out quickly.",

Others had come in after us and after they checked in this older waitress with not the nicest of attitudes came over and started seating people. It was odd because she started seating everyone else that checked in after us so when I was about to go to the host I  heard him say, you know that couple ( meaning us) was here first. She shrugged her shoulders and grabbed 2 menus came over to us brought us to a table dropped the menus and walked off. Rude nasty attitude all the way.  The server came and we ordered. I got the waffle Benedict and my husband got pot of bread French toast. The server was ok yet after she dropped the food she never checked on us. If she had we would have told her how the French toast was raw in the middle on quite a few of the pieces and eggs Benedict is supposed to have poached eggs with a soft yolk my eggs were practically hard boiled.  The two stars is because the coffee and juice were good. Other then that nothing was good about this place. We wont be back.",

I had chicken and waffles and it was amazing. Many places try to make their chicken and waffles confusing/adding too many other ingredients. Simple is best, and Jamms did that. yum! friend had a mix of stuff; grits, bacon, eggs, hash browns, and we got a free pot of bread, i think it's called, from my check-in on yelp.

Jamms is one of these, and is my favorite place to get breakfast in between class or whenever I have a craving for a pot of bread.  They have a great menu, and decent prices (averaging 20$ for two people). It can get busy depending on the times, and it does close early for Vegas time. I have never had slow service or a bad server, in fact, they get me in and out very quickly so I never worry.   They have a great selection of omelettes and pancakes (Smores are the best) and they have a special Pot of Bread every now and then. So far I have tried the Pumpkin with cream cheese and the chocolate brownie with marshmallow, both were amazing but the brownie one was the best.",

I think the reason this little place is so popular is their Pot O' Bread. What is Pot O' Bread, let me assist you. It's fresh bread dough, placed in a little ceramic ramekin, then baked, then delivered to your table. Recently they've added flavors of the week (recent flavors: chocolate peanut butter cup, cherry cheese cake, cinnamon raisin).  Jamms has a wide variety of options found at any dinner. Jamms' food isn't all that special. It's on par with Denny's and IHOP.   The service is friendly, warm, and prompt. Coffee mugs, water glasses, and iced teas are never left empty. The restaurant is clean and loud. There are scattered tables and booths. On the weekends (Sat and Sun), there is looooong wait, so get here early.  On the way out, be sure to pick up a free piece of gum to get the sausage, egg, and whatever else is on your tastes buds.",

Alas, I went to the Yelp app on my iPhone and found a nearby breakfast eatery that was also averaging around four stars. It literally took us about three minutes to get to Jamm's and big surprise...it's in a strip mall, our third off-the-Strip place that was in a strip mall. We noticed the place was abuzz with customers but not nearly to the level of the Hash House. There was a fifteen-minute wait here, and the diners were not nearly as fashionably attired.   It's a modest operation, the type that has a cheery hostess and cartoon murals on the walls. The menu is pretty robust, but unlike the nearby Egg & I, there was a lot more thought and care in the execution of the dishes. Jamie W. ordered the $8.45 Reuben Omelet, which was full of strands of corned beef and mounds of sauerkraut. There was also a generous slab of Swiss cheese melted on top and a side of crispy hashed browns (see photo). I went for a similar dish, the $8.50 Irish Skillet, which had the same corned beef accompanied by diced onions, green peppers and potatoes, all mixed into scrambled eggs and melted cheddar cheese (see photo). It was a mess of high-cholesterol goodness well put together. Tasty too.   Jamie, in a moment of insanity laced with homesickness for his Midwestern roots, also ordered the $5.25 full order of Biscuits and Country Gravy, which was a gloppy pool on a plate (see photo). I won't deny it wasn't good in a deep Southern kitchen kind of way with the biscuits sopping up all that gravy, though I attempted to re-purpose it as an extra topping for my skillet breakfast. Bloated was the way we both felt afterward but also sated. Needless to say, I also noticed they decorated the restroom stall with the same cartoon murals. Somebody must have had time on their hands. By the way, the waitress was also cheery, chatty and about nineteen. She was refilling my coffee cup with unadulterated pleasure.   FOOD - 4 stars...country breakfasts with deli twists, well executed with simple ingredients  AMBIANCE - 3 stars...kitchen cozy with Fingerhut touches  SERVICE - 4 stars...cheery thy name is Jamm  TOTAL - 4 stars...good diner-style eats can be found in a strip mall",

Great flavor and I absolutely loved the texture of all the caramelized onions and crispy corned beef hash.  Very good.  I also was curious to see what all the hype was about the Pots of bread.

Service is fast and friendly and they treat you like family (they were really accommodating to my husband's request for hard boiled eggs).  The food was good solid diner fare.  We ordered the eggs benedict, the chicken fried steak and eggs, and a side of corned beef hash. Everything was good, but we loved loved LOVED the house fries and the corned beef hash (which was perfected seasoned and lightly crisped).

If only I'm lucky enough to visit when that cackling waitress has the day off. She's a great gal, don't get me wrong, but wow that laugh is tough to take early in the morning.  One time I had a \"fluffy\" omelet.  Well, it wasn't fluffy.  It was a regular omelet like any other.  I mentioned it to the lady at the cash register when I paid.  \"I don't think that was a fluffy omelet,\" I said.  Just a harmless comment, not a complaint.  Of course she got huffy.  I think she was the owner.  She looked at me like, Who are you the galloping gourmet?  \"All of our omelets are fluffy,\" she insisted in a crabby tone.    OK fine, calm down.  It left me with such a negative feeling I haven't been back. It's not that I'm holding a grudge but an experience like that cuts my enthusiasm for a place.  I don't feel welcome there anymore. Now I go to Red Rock casino or Denny's. Jamm's is so busy that one customer more or less is no big deal. They won't have that annoying fluffy omelet guy to deal with anymore.    Good for kids:  Don't encourage people with \"good for kids\" votes.  Let 'em invade Denny's or I-Hop with their screaming whining little hellions. This is a small restaurant.  A tantrum will disrupt the whole place.",

My go to is the stuffed French toast, but if you don't have a super sweet tooth like me, I'd suggest the the Chicken BLT with Green Waffles.   Also make a point to try out their pot of bread.",

BF and I started with coffee and OJ, then opted for different omelets: the Jamm's signature omelet for me  (bearnaise sauce on the side, I never used it), Joe's omelet for my guy. Each omelet is about $10, and includes your bread of choice (I opted for the plain pot bread, BF had the special: walnut brownie) as well as an additional side (wedge fries for me, cottage cheese for the dude). Good portion sizes for the price, both with the variety of sides and the sizes of individual items.  Omelets were both cooked perfectly: others have said they are drowning in cheese, which is not entirely True. Mine had a good amount, but the Joe's omelet was a little lighter. Both had good amounts of meat and veggies.  The fries are tasty and seasoned, served in a cute little individual fryer basket container (cute!), cottage cheese is standard. The pot bread was a delightful surprise! Preferred the plain flavor: reminded me of slightly-sweet biscuits with dinner, growing up with homestyle country meals. The walnut brownie pot bread was sweet, but no overwhelmingly chocolatey or nutty- the name had made me expect more of a dessert on the table, but it wasn't overkill.  Service, as others have said, rocks. Attentive and polite, not overbearing or annoying. Will be returning to try the benedicts and perhaps a lunch one of these days. And the featured pot bread, of course!",

The coffee was very tasty and the large mug that it was served in kept it warm. Everything was well cooked. Yummy food (and I'm not too big on eggs)",

This restaurant is located on Rainbow in the same shopping center as Home Depot and Strip N' Dip Chicken Strips.  $28.77 got us a pancake combo, a white castle omelet, and grits.  The white castle omelet has ground beef, cheese, and onions inside and comes with home fries, which are sliced potatoes cooked with onions and peppers.  I thought it tasted a lot like a white castle.  The pancake combo comes with your choice of sausage or bacon and then eggs cooked however you like them.  The pancakes were ridiculously fluffy-they had to have been an inch thick!  They were so tasty and the eggs and sausage were perfect.  They brought out two containers of butter without me asking, which I really appreciated.  There's nothing worse than getting big pancakes and they hand you one packet of butter.   The grits were cooked well but lacked salt.  I liked that they brought butter with the grits without asking. Paula Deen would be proud of my obsession with butter today.",

Everything was great- the atmosphere, the menu options, the workers (even dealing with my indecisive wife who wanted first available, then a booth, then first available, then switched to a booth).   We checked in with yelp and both got a free \"bread pot\" which was freshly baked and delicious. I ordered an omelet with ham, cheddar and broccoli. There was so much meat and cheese in it I was full until dinner (and needed two rolaids).  We also split a fruit plate which was freshly cut and good even though some of it wasn't in season.   All things considered, probably one of the best breakfast diners we've been to in a while, that's even with the fact it wasn't exactly cheap. Money well spent.",

Honestly I thought it would be nothing more than a sweet cinnamon bun. I was wrong. It's really a bread, lightly sweetened, baked in a cute little foil pie pan that you pull apart. It was nicely balanced as a bread and not too sweet. The server and busser were super friendly and always checking if we needed refills. We just might make this our new breakfast spot when on that side of town.",

OJ was good though not fresh squeezed, steak & eggs were good, biscuits were good though the gravy lacked in flavor so we left that. Hash browns came out just as ordered, nice & crispy. The french toast (we ordered the basic one) had a bit too much vanilla in them for us. We would come back if in the area.",

I wouldn't make any special trips to go back.  We went for breakfast. I got the pancakes, eggs, and sausage, which were something that would served in the sample isles of Walmart (nothing special). With enough butter and syrup, you could make it workable. The eggs were just ordinary (but hot) and the sausage was kinda tasty.  My wife's french toast was bland (where the **** is the cinnamon?) Then,  the hashbrowns lacked the seasoning that makes a good shredded potato!   Having said that, the place is in a \"conditioned\" part of Vegas. I wouldn't say it's ghetto, but in a middle-of-the-road type area. Now, the service was amazing, the servers and managers were very attentive and nice! I love good people working together. The 3 stars are for the service...0 stars for the \"cooks\".  AJ",

The potatoes or home fries served with the omelet were better than most. The lemonade was delicious, no minute maid here! The service was fast and friendly.

On to the food- well let's just say two orders of French toast fries and the pot of bread we ordered was not very impressive. I didn't order food but my 7 and 8 year old did. The French toast came with out powdered sugar (which was a selling point for my children when pictured on the menu) and so we had to wait for the waitress to come back to ask for it bc my daughter wouldn't touch it with out it. End result- I nibbled at it and I not my kids were impressed. Burger King had better French toast sticks... And well the pot of bread... YUCK.   30 dollars to feed my 7 and 8 year old sub par food with moody service?... I didn't even order food... Nah I'll pass. Won't be back.",

She remembers our order and treats us like family. One of the biggest perks of this place is the pots of bread. They have a regular one and then a special one daily.  The blueberry lemon and cinnamon are my favorites.  FYI: stay clear of the biscuits. The gravy is to die for but the biscuits taste like frozen hockey pucks.

Our waitress was Lorena, she was very professional, she greeted us with a smile.  She took our drink order, and as I was checking in when she came back, I showed her my yelp check in offer.  They have some bread for free.  So I choose the lemon and blueberry!  I have no idea what it is.  It came in this tin thingy, it was really a 1 person serving.  My husband got into it before I could take a picture.  But OMG, it was yummy!  The bread almost felt like it was not done, but it was so freaking good! So I got the pastrami!  Ok, most places that serve pastrami, it's piled on the bread!  This looked like 3 strips of bacon between 2 pieces of bread!  for $10.00  Not worth it!  The skinny fries were good though.  My husband ordered french toast, eggs and sausage.  He loved every bit of it. Next time I will stick with breakfast!",

I was not familiar with Pot of Bread.  Its kinda soft fluffy breakfast roll that they flavor and serve with light icing.  Today i tried the cinnamin raisin.  Great!  They also gave me a reeces cup one to go.  Excited to eat it on the plane.  No cinnabun for me!  Give them a try if youre in the area.  Good break from the strip and right on the way to Red Rock.  Off Rainbow and Charleston.  I forgot, also the coffee is pretty good, and im a coffee snob",

I say unusual, but in reality I believe there must be a lot of people like me in the world because restaurants like this keep using the bread to draw us in! Their little bread pots are everything I need in life! They always serve the plain and cinnamon and then have a special bread of the day. I never normally like the bread of the days as much, so I stick to the plain. I hate to say this, but the rest of their food is probably a three star total. It's delicious breakfast food but nothing spectacular or different. Come for the bread, get fat for the bread, die for the bread. I just made them a new slogan!   A lot of older people go here, it seems to be their customer base. This is fine, except for sometimes I feel like I don't get good service because of my age. They aren't rude, they just aren't super accommodating. I'm not a teenager or anything but I try to go with my mom to make sure we are taken care of right. Still, love this place!!",

Many of the diners here in Vegas either give you a small omelette/skimp on the ingredients or give you an enormous omelette which no normal person can stomach. Jamms gives you a good portion size with quality ingredients for a great price. They also offer tapas plates which is an awesome idea for a brunch to try many breakfast dishes as this meal is by far the hardest to decide in the morning. I very much enjoyed my meal here from the waitstaff to the meal to the 10% yelp check in coupon to the fact that my meal came in at $20 for a solid morning starter.

I wouldn't recommend ordering the steak because it was not tender and it's very poor choice cut of meat the little bread pots are good the eggs were just loaded with cheese with no flavor  no salt or pepper and I had to send it back the crunchy French toast is OK we did however like the orange juice",

As mentioned in other reviews, if you mention Yejp, free pots of bread for you!(Its actually bread baked in a ramekin) we had Original, Cinnamon, and their flavor of the week, Pumpkin Spice.  We also ordered a French Press of Illy Coffee and some OJ...after browsing the menu, wifey settles for the Sandy(?) omelette(according to Carol-Ann, the most popular one) and I go for the Corned Beef Hash with Hash Browns, both extra crispy. we also tried one s'mores pancake, just because:)  Overall, food was pretty good, but Jamm's serves up the best corned beef hash in town!(sorry Du-Pars, you're still king of pancakes though!)

I got my eggs scrambled with American cheese, and sides of hash browns, coffee pot of bread and a plate of red velvet pancakes.  I also tried the raisin pot of bread and their cabbage soup.  Everything was good.  The eggs were cooked to my liking, the hash browns were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, and the pancakes were fluffy.  I liked the coffee pot of bread better than the raisin but both were good.  The only thing wrong was the steak that I ordered medium but got well done and burnt.  The service was good and we got 10% off by making a Facebook post.  Can't beat that.",

That's about as good as it got. I ordered the Jamm's French toast, which was pretty good. I also ordered scrambled eggs, sausage and hash browns. My eggs tasted like they had been prepared with dishwater, and the hash browns has a foul odor to them, that I couldn't even get past to taste. The sausage was average and a bit room temperature. I was pretty disappointed in the food this visit. If I were to come back, I would stick to French toast and avoid side dishes.",

Pros- Great customer service, Pat O'Brien Potatoes, and Pot O Bread.  Cons- Sometimes the Pot O Bread has been sitting under the lamp for too long and the top gets hard, don't be afraid to ask for something fresher.   Check in with Yelp and you can try the Pot O Bread for free (usually).   If you're vegan, try one of the scrambles and ask for no egg plus pat o brien potato.",

Food: 4/5 Their food is great. They have different flavors of pot of bread every time I come in, and they're always good. The pot of bread is always fluffy and full of flavor. Their french toast is one of the better ones in town, they're coated in corn flakes, which makes them extra crispy. This visit I decided to get the chicken and waffles sandwich. The sandwich is just chicken tenders with lettuce on top of waffles. It was good, but I feel like there are better options on the menu.",

I have to say that the service was truly good and based on that alone I would go back. You can tell that they care a lot about their customers and it really stood out to me that they knew their regulars' names and usual orders. I loved seeing that. You can tell that they go the extra mile and really try to get to know their customers.   The food was also tasty.The portions are generous and the food leaves you feeling full afterwards. I ordered the Sandy Omelet (I was pretty hungry I forgot to take a picture of it) and my husband ordered the California Benedict. The omelet was really, really good and my husband enjoyed his meal as well.   Everything was tasty, fresh, and filling. I highly recommend coming to Jamms.",

    "text": "I was excited to try this place after a coworker kept telling me how great it was. I went on a Saturday afternoon and waited about 30 minutes to be seated. People kept getting in line so I figured the wait must be worth it.   While in line, I couldn't help noticing that there were 3 hostesses/cashiers just chit chatting about their drunken shenanigans from the night before. Not very professional but I wasn't there for them... I was there for the food!  When we were finally seated, a lovely gentleman came by and got our drink order. The server took about 10 minutes to come to our table. Longer than I would have liked, but again I wanted to try this food.   My companion and I ordered two separate dishes with the intention of sharing. I ordered the Sandi Omelet (bacon, cheddar cheese, green pepper, and sour cream) with homefries. My companion ordered the steak and eggs. We both ordered the cinnamon raisin pot of bread.   The gentleman that took our drink order brought us our coffee and checked on us more than our server.  His service was perhaps the best part of our visit.   Cinnamon Raisin Pot of Bread- was disappointing. It was dry and had no raisins on the inside which leads me to believe it's the same dough as the pot of bread that's been brushed with butter and sprinkled with cinnamon sugar and a few raisins before baking.   Sandi Omelet- it's an Omelet that's folded over and has full size bacon strips tucked into the center. Not what I was expecting. It was an average omelet. It's saving grace was the salsa although I'm still not sure how salsa fits into the Irish theme of the restaurant. The homefries tasted as if they had been made in a large batch and were reheated.   Steak and Eggs- had high hopes when I saw that they had a grill to cook their steaks. Big let down. The meat tasted as if it had been in the fridge for far too long. Otherwise cooked fine, but flavor was off.   Overall, I don't think this restaurant lives up to the hype.",

My kind of place,  good belly food. our waitress was full of good spirits and smile's   I asked her for a recommendation and she stated that I couldn't go wrong with the traditional eggs Benedict which is what I ordered, My wife ordered the veggie omelette with hollandaise sauce on top.  I also Asked if I could start with a bowl of clam chowder since it was Friday, The waitress replied of course but would you like a cup instead of a bowl our bowls are quite large  I have been told this many times before  only to find the bowl just a hair bigger than a cup  so I said nope I want to bowl. \"Ok doll she says with a smile.  like a fool I did not take a photo of the bowl  but it was funny the bowl is the same size of their plate just deep I could've dropped four cell phones in here and hidden them easily.  I quickly went to work and with every spoon lifted up to my mouth I seen my wife's eyebrows raise as if to say are you really going to eat the whole thing. I explain to my wife that at this point it was my duty to finish the bowl I was warned by the waitress that the bowl was large and I did not listen.   Bottom line great service great food & I forgot to mention earlier the bus boy was fantastic,   This place clearly saves money by not needing  a dishwasher since every plate is licked clean.",

It should have probably been cooked till it shredded. The hash browns were deep fried and had the over cooked potato taste when they are cooked till burnt. I ordered a side of gravy because I wanted to try it as this is like a mom and pop shop. The gravy didn't taste like breakfast gravy more like chicken gravy. The color and flavor was definitely chicken flavor. Not sure what the meat was inside the gravy but it didn't taste like anything. I had some sourdough toast which was good except they oiled it with what tasted like a butter substitute for cooking on a flat top. I just wish things were much better.",

The service is a lot better too...although it seems a bit busy and every server and busser walks hastily through the small diner. The pot of bread was interesting. It lacked flavor, but I'm not much on sweets so it was decent for me - just expected sweetness and it was shocking to taste that it wasn't. We got today's special pot of bread: creamy strawberry (?) and it looked really weird because of all the sprinkles they decided to put on it. They could do without the sprinkles and maybe add a piece of strawberry on top? My boyfriend declined tasting the pot of bread until I told him to look past the child-like mess that sprinkles have painted on them and he actually finished it. I definitely want to try the cinnamon one next time though!   Also, their home fries. Delicious. They are potato masters for sure! I can't wait to go back.

It's not a diner without booths, honestly.  I was intrigued by the variety of burritos on display, so went for the White Castle (I'm white trash like that). It was what you would expect (and as described): ground beef, onions, cheese, and they serve it with ranch on the side. I've never put ranch on a burrito before, but when in Jamms, I just went with it. Truth be told, it completed the experience.  Great service, nice people. Ample parking. This is a go-to for brekkies and brunch.",

    "text": "Jamms has won the RJ readers poll for the best breakfast in Vegas basically every year since the beginning of time, but then again, the RJ readers voted Taco Bell as the best Mexican food in town last year, so screw those people.  The Fat Man knows what he's talking about when it comes to food.  You want the skinny on this place from the Fat Man?  I live off of Boulder Hwy in Henderson.  This place is at Rainbow and Charleston.  (About 35 minutes from my house.)  I don't do mornings, and I'm not generally a breakfast eater...But at least once a month, my wife and I get up early and trek across town just to eat at Jamms.    Over the years I've had a few things on their lunch menu, and I'll be honest...I'm not a fan.  But their breakfast....oh baby, their breakfast.  Their omelets are light and fluffy and PACKED with toppings.  They have about 30 omelets to choose from, so you have plenty of options (The White Castle is by far my favorite.)  Their corn flake french toast is AMAZING.  I have often wished for their signature pina colada french toast as a dessert after dinner at night.  (When I start thinking about that is usually when we go to Jamms the next morning)         Their fresh baked pot-o-bread is some of the best bread I've ever had.  It's like a poofy dinner roll baked like a muffin, only airier and fluffier and full of wonderousness. (And yes, that's a word.  I just made it up.) I usually get the original, but they also offer cinnamon raisin and the \"flavor of the day\".  Ladies and Gents, as I said before, I don't do mornings.  As I often say, \"they call it mourning for a reason\".  Anything that can make me EXCITED about getting up early is something special.  Jamms is one of those rare things.   The only thing better than the food at Jamms is the atmosphere.  The staff is friendly, helpful, and courteous.  They are always smiling and chatting with the customers.  They are excellent about refilling drinks and making sure you are enjoying your meal, but they also find that perfect line between being helpful and not hovering.  Ronnie (the owner) has great taste in employees, and has almost no turnover.  Almost all of the wait staff has been there since I started going there nearly 10 years ago.    My only caution about this place is to be careful.  Once you have eaten here a few times, it can become an addiction.  I'm pretty sure they put crack in their food to make you crave it more.  :)",

In the land of all you can eat, and Feng Shue less is more, they serve you well and you leave having eaten all you can.  both my wife's and my omelettes were filled to bursting. Her bacon and avocado were more than sufficient in the omelette. It was so big she ended up having to open it up to eat the insides and then still left food behind. The hashbrowns were done perfectly, crispy and flavorful and a good-sized portion. The homemade chips are perfectly sliced and served in their own little french fry basket. The bread pots are amazing. That special of the week was the pumpkin and cream cheese glaze bread pot and it was delicious. If you're thinking about coming, do it!

First its packed so be prepared to wait. The interior of this place looks like one of those diners you would find in the middle of nowhere, very run down and dinghy. Our waitress was an old lady who seemed to be somewhere else, just doing her 9-5 so you can imaging the service. I got the country fried steak and eggs with hash browns and a biscuit; my gf got steak and eggs with home fries and a side of biscuits and gravy and we got the free bread bowl with our check in on yelp. First the bread bowl had been sitting on the counter with all the other bread bowls because it was very hard on top and cold so that was horrible, my gf steak looked like it had been cooked in a mirco wave, very dry and chewy (medium rare). On the other hand my country fried steak was great, deep fried perfectly great taste however my eggs were mediocre just your basic mass amount of pre made eggs sitting in the back so again cold and flavorless. The biscuits and gravy weren't too bad, good flavor to the gravy and the biscuits were soft and flakey. Overall nothing special about this place dont see where the hype is, back to Mr Mamas better breakfast",

The regular coffee is good, but the coffee press is worth looking like a nouveau french pretentious wannabe intellectual.  Yep, it's that good.    Again, a good place to start the day.",

    "text": "Another great breakfast find in the Vegas area!  Well, it wasn't necessarily a 'find' considering we attempted to roll through during a prior LV trip and the line was out the door. This time, we walked right in and found a seat without a problem.    To share, we ordered French toast sticks and our Yelp check-in came with a free order of 'pot' bread. Who knew Vegas could consistently dish out amazing pieces of breaded sweetness!? The French toast sticks were a crisp golden brown, doused with cinnamon & powdered sugar, buttered and came with a side of good ol' fashioned syrup. The pot bread was truly a surprising delight. Scratch that, the NUTELLA PEANUT BUTTER it came with was truly the surprising delight. Sooo rich, so sugary.. *Sweats profusely* I actually don't like sugar rushes. I triggered one here and don't plan on having another one anytime soon.  I grabbed the chicken fried steak in country gravy with eggs over easy and home fries. I feel like I say this every time I eat this meal at a new location, but easily one of the best chicken fried steaks I've had in awhile. HUGE portion size that could easily feed two; Breaded with seasons that tickle the senses, a milky / creamy chicken gravy, moist insides and packed with a crunch. The gravy wasn't slopped all over the plate either. Right down the center of the steak with the ends just sticking out - you know it's the real deal when you subtract the gravy and have the steak bare.. if it's good without the gravy, then you have yourself a winner. In this case it was a complete winner.. The home fries were up to par too - with caramelized onions, bell peppers, crisp edges and just enough salt.  But really, I can't believe I wasted stomach space on the sweet stuff. I was relatively upset when I realized I was already full just about halfway through.. So, I unbuckled my pants and let the button go. We were finishing this off no matter what. Every bite was savored, and not forgotten.   Our service was great, from hostess, to waitress, to the busser who rolled through and took plates not being used as well as various staff members giving the complimentary coffee / water refill here and there. Nothing weird happened, everyone was smiling, the prices were low and my stomach was appreciative.",

I am so excited that we finally found a local breakfast/ brunch location that we can be proud to call our breakfast home.  We must have come at the right time for Sunday brunch because we were seated with no problem.  But, after a few minutes- the waiting area was filled to the brim with hungry patrons.    I ordered the Eggs Florentine and after a number of misses with the hollandaise sauce at other breakfast joints- I finally found one that was perfect.  Of course, I mentioned yelp- and even got a free pot of freshly baked bread- and I selected the flavor of the day: apricot.  Yummo! My husband ordered his usual- chicken fried steak with a side of country potatoes and devoured it.  My cousin ordered an omelet and another ordered a sandwich with steak fries which were so delicious.  We also shared a plate of peach french toast and not a crumb was left.  Yes- we were quite the hungry bunch.   Awesome service, awesome food and I love the fact that it is family owned.  We even left with some \"Jamms coffee mugs\" because we are such fans.  As their motto says, we did \"enter as strangers, left as friends\".  See you soon, new friend!",

Due to some physical conditions I am unable to do much cooking at home because I can't stand in one place very long, hence the reason I eat at Jamms a few times a week.   It distresses me that a review from a Janice on 6-18-2016 was so distasteful (pun intended) because she claims to have found a hair in her French fries and was sad that they only took the price of the fries off of her bill when she clearly was looking for a free meal.   I know everyone at Jamms and my 6 g-kids are regulars as well as g-ma.  we have never found anything, that didn't belong, in our food but if we had they would have either replaced the item or taken it off our bill.  to expect a free meal for that is stupid and reminds me when people used to PUT things in their food in order to get out of paying for it.  Jamms is, without a doubt, THE BEST RESTAURANT IN LAS VEGAS and if you haven't been there yet, you should check it out.",

This is more than just a place to eat, but more like a full on old school experience. Everyone is personable, so friendly, and the service is great. Fresh coffee refills. The food... MAGIC. This is the spot for home made yummy breakfast and lunch, and it never fails to disappoint. I'm a picky eater and they have something for everyone! Classic foods, as well as creative spins on things. Portions are hearty, and I never leave feeling hungry or over stuffed. The best part... it's not expensive. My boyfriend and I paid 20$ for the two of us to eat, which makes the experience even better. 10/10 would recommend!!",

We didn't see my boyfriends family that we were meeting and we weren't sure if his little brother would make it, so we asked for a table of 4 to 5. She told us she couldn't seat us unless our whole party was there. I understand places that have this policy, but usually they tend to explain it nicer than they did here. The woman's tone was very unfriendly. We asked if it was possible just to put us at a table for 5 just incase the little brother snuck in a little late, not even order and her response was \"well it depends if I seat you at a table for 4 or 5\" ... Ok so please make it 5? Thankfully right then the little brother walked in and we didn't have to deal with her anymore. We were seated and quickly taken care of by a really spunky and nice waitress, she was seriously great. Big personality!  I ordered the small plate omelet and their pot bread (cinnamon raisin). The omelet was average, I really wasn't blown away by it. The saving grace of the meal was the pot bread which was warm and delicious!  Food was ok, front desk customer service was bad, and waitress was great! Probably won't go out of my way to eat here again when I visit Vegas.",

I ordered a omelet here and was really surprised by the size of the omelet, the amount of vegetables, and best of all the perfect amount of cheese. The omelet was fluffy and didn't have a overcooked patch of burnt on it at all. It was very beautiful. I was there at 8:30 am on Monday and I was so happy that there weren't loud mulitple crowds. It was consistently busy but not overwhelming and annoying. My friend and I sat there for quite a while catching up and best of all the server didn't harrass constantly. They let us talk for quite awhile without interrupting.  The only bad thing I had to say was the hashbrowns were TOO crispy for me. They were overcooked and crunchy and had that burnt potato flavor. Other than that---this is one of my new favorite spots for breakfast.",

    "text": "This place is alright if you're in the mood for a slightly heavy, but nonetheless tasty breakfast. The potted bread is fantastic. Anything with gravy is a bit overwhelming and insanely bad for you. Much of the menu is greasy and pretty strange. Some of it is just plain bad. Some of it is delicious. The menu is massive, which is a personal turn off. Perhaps the reason why the food takes so long to come out every time. However, the staff is friendly and on top of service. Great tips for our waitress each time.   Small plate options are awesome. Just little samples of anything you want for an inexpensive or reasonable price. They also offer discounts for posting and checking in on social media. It's a pretty nice way to save a couple bucks on your meal.   Overall, the food can go either way. I've had good experiences as well as awful ones in Jamms. The restaurant is old and outdated (this would usually not bother me, but it does make it look fairly dirty). The staff are great, no doubt. I personally would not eat here again, but my fiance loves the potted bead enough to come back.",

I've both called in orders and dined in (many times) and have yet to come a cross a  poor attitude or rude remark. The food is fantastic all around, but where it's really at is the breakfast burritos. It's without a doubt a tough job to find a good breakfast burrito in LV. I'm talkin good ratios of egg/meat/cheese, crispy and well seasoned potatoes (but not overdone), and a quality tortilla. Oh yeah, Jamms nails it. Plus, you can make any of their omelets into a breakfast burrito. I recommend the Denver with crispy bacon instead of ham. God I want one now.",

The service has that family owned feel where you feel welcomed the whole time your there. Their pot o bread is the best i have had in vegas, i love the variety of flavors and there is always a different special flavor when we dine. So far the nutella banana and the pineapple cream cheese ones are my 2 favorites. My husbands favorite breakfast to order no matter where we dine is the Corned beef and hash with potato and eggs. He says hands down they make it the best in the city. I normally pick an omelet and they are always light and fluffy and taste fresh. The prices are affordable and you get a discount for checking in on social media and you show them at the register. We love this place and it's our new breakfast place when we decide to eat out. I can see why they have so many great reviews and repeat customers.",

They overcooked her eggs and we had to ask for new ones.  The hashbrowns were crispy and good.  I ordered their Jamms omelet.  It was stuffed with thinly sliced roast beef that was crisped on the grill with grilled mushrooms, onions and cheddar cheese.  This was all topped with a homemade bearnaise.  It was fabulous. It all went perfectly together and I loved the crispy beef.  I also ordered their pot of bread.  It had a crunchy outside and a soft inside.  Very good.

    "text": "I have been to jamms quite a few times and this time particularly rubbed me the wrong way. The food was great and amazing I give the chef a 8/10. It was well prepared and delicious. Why I am giving this visit a 3 star is because the customer service provided today. The associates were very  and seemed irritable because it took longer than usual to go through the menu of great options. I witnessed my server speaking to other associates about our table and kept getting eyes from the associates she would speak to about the table. My server asked the drink provider to give us more water and he displayed an action of not wanting to do it. I get that it is a job but the people eating should not feel in easy or insecure while waiting for their food. In addition all of the staring eyes as we were sitting here did not make jamms to feel like the homey vibe I am used to. Customer service is my number one priority. I can eat anywhere it is the workers that make this experience and it was not a great customer service experience. I felt singled out and the center of their work gossip. We did speak with the manager about it and she made it more comfortable. So I thank the manager for doing a great job. I will highly recommend this place it has amazing food! I will go again maybe at a different time to have a different set of workers.",

The resto is a typical family diner, but not quite that of a greasy spoon.  Menu offerings were fairly standard as they had a nice variety of omelets, skillets, eggs and such, french toast, waffles and pancakes.  I ordered their Corned Beef Hash and Eggs, which was definitely none of that can stuff, it was housemade and cooked to perfection!  It was one of the better offerings of CBH I've ever had; you can trust me on that, I've been eating CBH since I was a kid.  The pot of bread it came with was served piping hot and was yummy.  I added butter and jelly and it was a nice treat.  Definitely skip the toast and go for the good stuff!  Service was very friendly, they kept our glasses full and most importantly my coffee cup filled with hot caffeine goodness.  Which by the way, their coffee was pretty good!  Overall, Jamms is a nice spot for breakfast, we'd come back again!",

We made the 8 mile trek from the strip and found Jams.  The first visit I had the Steak and Eggs. The steak was nothing fancy, just a typical cheap diner steak. It was cooked well but it was just okay. The \"breadpot\" was pretty damn tasty. I had cinnamon raisin and added lots of whipped butter. VERY tasty =D  The second visit (not my idea.... families idea...) I had the Texas Chili Omelet. This visit proved to be much tastier! The chili was meaty and flavorful. They were more than willing to add onions and jalapenos, per my request. I had the pumpkin and marshmallow breadpot with sweeeeet sugary frosting =D.   Overall it's a great local place. The staff was quick and friendly. Refills were pretty quick.   Only thing that bothers be is the gramatically incorrect wording on the front page of the menu.",

The service just met my expectations, not bad but nothing special.   The ambiance reminded me of an old fashioned diner. The decor was very dated and to be honest the place felt dirty to me.  My husband and I both ordered omelets, the Jamm's specialty omelet and the Ruben omelet both notated as favorite items on the menu. Maybe we just ordered the wrong meals as both left a lot to be desired. The home potatoes were inedible. It's a shame I was given such a large portion. The meals do however come with a \"pot o' bread'. You can choose cinnamon raisin or white bread. These reminded me of bread my grandmother used to make at Thanksgiving, just plain ol yeasty bread. This trip down memory lane gave Jamm's the extra star.   To be a good breakfast spot, the coffee needs to be spot on. This was another failing aspect of Jamm's. They use Illy coffee which I find to lack the robustness I love about coffee, almost watered down. I know many people love Illy though so this might just be a matter of preference.  Overall, I will probably never return to Jamm's. I typically give places two chances to win me over but on a good day Jamm's could probably only muster one additional star out of me.",

There isnt much in waiting area and I hate creating a clusterfuck in front of the hostess booth where people are trying to ojt their name and check out. it was too cold to hang outside so we left our number with them to sit in the car instead.  We decided to share  Rueben Benedict -I was expecting more like chunky pieces of corned beef but they use deli cut for this but guess that makes sense too. Overall solid Benedict as the Hollandaise was perfectly done.  We got their home froed potatoes which was pretty good flavor with peppers and onions. Only I might ask to get a bit of it crisped up next time.    Jamms Signature Omelette - this isn't the fluffiest of omeletttes and is stiffer but still good. This has onions, mushrooms, peppers, steak and cheese in it topped with bernaise. It wasn't plentiful on the thin sliced steak (think like philly cheese or gyro), but all the components were decent. We also got home fried potatoes with this and this comes with a bread choice.    Seeing as they are famous for potted bread we chose that.  They always have plain or cinnamon and rotate a flavor of the week. Vanilla caramel was this weeks which soinds like everything we liked. It is similar to brioche crisp on the top and fluffy inside and theu fave us a whipped butter frosting like spread.  Yeah,  Im a fan of the bread.    Service was always friendly, and definitely on top of things. They are quite speedy here, our food was out in no time and drinks refilled stat.   I can see why people like this place.  Its solid, no frills American hearty portioned breakfast with good service. I'll be back if I ever wake up early enough again.",

So the 'Huge Portions' thing is far from real. Next, cold eggs and film/skin on top of both gravy and maple syrup is for rookies like Denny's, not the type of place the Food Network personalities film an episode at.  Very sub-par, below average and will most likely be removed from our Las Vegas Best Breakfast website!",

Today it was horrible..hair cooked in my fries..and my daughters panini had next to nothing in it compared to the last time we were there. After telling the waitress about it she apologized by saying..hair flies around..we all have it and she would rather have a bug in it than a hair. Enough was enough but then she proceeded to tell us they found a frog in the spinach once. Not sure what her motive was but in the end she took 2.00 off for the fries. After finding hair i had only ate 1/4 of my wrap. My stomach turned at this point and made me sick. I dont go to a restaurant to order hair in the food and this should of been entirely written off the bill. What a disappointment!",

I had the reuben benedict, the English muffin was nice and crispy, eggs well cooked, hollandaise was missing a bit of bite and the whole thing was a little under salted but most things are for me. The coffee cups are huge for a diner and they have great coffee.  Great service and pricing is on par with larger breakfast chains like IHOP. Overall great experience, will definitely be back.",

After about 9 this place is starting to get busy. OK the food is good but not great. I probably will not be going back. My omelet was to full of feta cheese and spinach, I get that's what was in it at least chops them both up in smaller pieces.  I will not tell u to go and I will not tell u it's the best food in town. I would have rather gone to hash house a gogo. Now that food has good taste. That's it the food did not have a lot of taste maybe it was what I had to eat. I like to taste my food. One more thing I forgot to tell the waitress that I had a free pot of bread so I told the lady as we were checking out and she was not the nicest. I had told her it was no bid deal but she was not very nice about it. What ever....... And if u post on yelp in another social media place u will get 10% off u need to show the lady when u check out.",

Menu looked like it had some interesting fair and some variety on old favorites. I decided to go with a Waffle Benedict for $9.99. $2.75 for an ice tea is a bit high, all the drinks were priced in this range. No offer for refill while I ate.   Service was quick, and my meal was served inside 10 minutes of ordering. Crispy hash browns were cooked to my liking. The hollandaise sauce didn't have much to it, no taste of lemon or anything. Pretty bland. I ended up squeezing left over lemon from my ice tea on it to get a little bit of taste. The waffle was good, the eggs poached right and the canadian bacon a little small. Nothing that would make me want to come back for but I will try another meal here of something different.",

    "text": "In typical Las Vegas fashion, do not be fooled by a store front.  So often I find that a strip mall with a nondescript doorway will lead to some wonderful experiences.  Point in fact for Jamms Restaurant.    It was my birthday and I wanted to try something new.  Hubby is always ready to please me and so my Yelp search begins.  After all the nice things posted about Jamms of course we had to visit.  This is a homey kitsch diner.  It is a throw back to years gone by, but do you know what else is a throw back to years gone by?  Their SERVICE.  I found where all good service has gone.  They have come to Jamms.  Warm welcoming smiles are the first thing you notice as you go through the doors and it continues with the wait and service staff.  Just old fashioned goodness.  Then comes the food.  HELLO YUMMY.  The food is old fashioned, homemade, deliciousness.  I ordered the Denver Potato Pancakes, first of all there is no way I could ever finish this dish on my own.  It is massive and not only in size but in flavor.  I could taste EACH AND EVERY ingredient in this dish.  So fresh and made to order.  I would drive miles for this dish.  Hubby and our guests ordered the skillets and only one gentleman was able to finish his meal.  They were big on size and flavors again.  Excellently prepared.  Hubby ordered the homemade bread with his meal.  Today's flavored bread was a Chipotle, Cheddar concoction and it was D E L I S H...  I highly recommend that you order their homemade bread, especially if you are a popover fan.  They are very much more like popovers than a typical bread.  This may have been our first visit here, but will definitely not be our last.  PS I spied a crunchy french toast whizzing past us.  It looked wonderful.",

A neighborhood breakfast/lunch eatery, the staff is always friendly, albeit a little slow on the service at times.  I think I've only been here on Fridays, so it's not too crazy busy and we've rarely had to wait for a table.  The pot o' bread is Jamms signature, basically a big yeasty dinner roll that comes with most of the breakfast platters, as well as getting a free one with your Yelp check-in.  Customers can choose the standard plain, cinnamon raisin, or the pot o'bread of the week; today's choice was triple chocolate brownie.  I had that pot o' bread plus the cinnamon raisin one that came with my corned beef hash breakfast--carb loading indeed!  If you haven't been here and love bread and breakfast like I do, give Jamms a try.",

The bread in a pot was extraordinary and clicking on Yelp made this complimentary.  The day's special was banana chocolate which was delicious as was the cinnamon raisin. We shared a veggie omelet.  It was fluffy and delicious.  My wife is a connoisseur of breakfast potatoes.  She said the Jamms was among the best she has ever had.  Our waitress told us that she had worked there for 14 years.  That says alot about the quality and management of the restaurant.  One suggestion we offered was to provide real maple syrup at an optional upcharge for the pancakes which were terrific but loss some quality with the imitation syrup offered.  All in all, Jamms is worth the few minutes drive from the Strip for a great a reasonably priced breakfast.",

When we arrived the place was crowded and there was about a 10 minute wait. no problem.  When we were finally seated, it took the server nearly 10 minutes just to get to the coffee. Now I know the place is busy but it's never too busy to serve coffee in a timely manner. But in all honesty, I have to say that once the ball was rolling, we did not have to wait for refills. Maybe there was a little redemption there.  The location. What is up with that? It was a big ugly strip mall which I think is a weird place for a restaurant but Las Vegas is so full of big ugly strip malls, there's just no place else to put a restaurant. It's bizarre.  The food is nothing beyond mediocre. I had a veggie omelet that was so loaded with cheddar that it just became a big greasy mess and worse by association, death on a plate. I tried to push as much of it to the side as I could and by the time I was finished, it was quite a pile.  The next time I'm in Vegas, I'm going to do some research and come up with my own breakfast spot",

The service was prompt and the staff was polite and helpful.  I had a standard sausage and egg breakfast which isn't too exciting. But being gluten intolerant I don't have a lot of choices that aren't some combination of meat, eggs and potatoes.  Still, it was well done and the server let me make substitutions for the bread item.  My wife had the chicken fried steak and eggs, and a \"Orange Creamcicle\" bread pot.  I was jealous because the bread pot looked like it would be really good.  Additionally she said the entire meal was delicious.  If you don't have to pick and choose like I do, their menu has a huge variety of choices.  Since they were mostly bread items I didn't spend much time with it, but they had an insert menu that offered small portions for less money so you can sample a large variety of their offerings without ordering multiple meals or eating off someone else's plate.  For the sake of the review I should have paid more attention to exactly what they called it, but this would be a good place to go to sample a variety of breakfast offerings.",

It was pretty packed when I got there, and so I had high hopes. Busy places usually mean good food.   Service itself was just bad. We were seated and given our menus, but no one came around after that for at least seven minutes. And when our waitress finally did come around, she had a very snide attitude.  I ordered the chicken fried steak. The steak was good and flavorful, and not the least bit dry. The gravy however, which was put on heavy handed, was disappointing. It had no flavor and added nothing to the dish. The scrambled eggs I ordered with it, were very dry. Which is a big pet peeve of mine. Scrambled eggs are probably my favorite thing to eat, and ruined eggs just ruin my meal.   The Sandy omelet was ordered by a couple others that I was eating with. Both of which said their omelets were dried out as well. And that it was just disgustingly full of bacon.   The Cinnamon raisin pot of bread was probably the best thing that was served to us.   I definitely don't see myself going back to this establishment.",

I don't really see what the hype is all about, I preferred the toast, actually.  The price was right, but the service was spotty. Hit or miss on my two trips here.

It was served in a ceramic pot before but now in a tin cup which seems to get the popover bread out quicker.  We have tried their Sandy burrito, eggs benedict, and pancakes. All good.   They have a $5 small plates menu, which I love and allows for you to sample a few choices.   Expect a wait over the weekend and definitely try their popover bread, they have seasonal ones and original which is my favorite.   I am not sure why they are called Jams, but if I were to guess without asking I would think they are known for their homemade jams which unfortunately I have not experienced here, only the typical packets of Smuckers",

So what should you expect: you may have a little wait because it is that busy. You can expect good service in a diner like setting. The best part: you can expect an awesome breakfast. The menu is vast with all kinds of choices, from healthy to sinful. Everything is delicious and they will prepare to your liking. The prices are incredibly reasonable which never hurts. I ordered an egg white omelette with feta cheese and spinach that came with house potatoes. My friend ordered the farmers omelette with the hashbrowns. Someone else at the table ordered French toast fries which are incredible and served with an incredible maple syrup sauce. I can go on... anything you want for breakfast... They have! Highly recommended.",

It's so adorable and warm and delicious. We usually get all three flavours when we go.  They have some of the best egg beni's in town. And I usually get mine with corned beef hash on top. Which by the way is freaking ridiculously good.  I don't think I'll ever stop coming here.",

I said, \"Dude, I need a place where people act like normal humans, don't speak like valley girls or modern Brooklyn people, and I can just relax.\" His top recommendation was Jamms. Happy we went. My wife enjoyed her vegetable omelette and my White Castle omelette was awesome. It legit tasted like a White Castle cheeseburger. Service was excellent. Each time the coffee got down about half way, someone was there to pour more. Loved it.",

It was like a diner and the place is small but housefull which is a good sign.   I ordered their Jamms Signature Omelet~  Sliced steak with mushrooms, onions, and cheese topped with their homemade bearnaise sauce $10.29  And also got their Chicken And Waffles to go.  I was expecting Fried chicken but it was crispy chicken fingers on a Belgian waffle served with syrup and whipped butter $10.59. When I opened the box, just a couple of chicken tenders on top of waffle. My bf says it looks sad LOL!  I was excited to come here since I had it bookmarked but the food was just ok. The pot of bread, which made them famous was nothing special, not a lot of flavor.   The waitress Shirley was attentive and fast.",

What brought us in was pina colada and the promotion of 10% off if we posted about them on social media. Our server said they stopped doing that a long time ago The best part of my French toast plate was the bacon. The bacon was crispy and so were the eggs with the egg shells.  Before adding butter to my French toast I tasted it because it looked odd. My palette was filled with the nasty taste of canola oil. The maple syrup tasted nothing like maple syrup it tasted like thick water with a synthetic blend.  The actual bread for the French toast was old and stale. The best part of the French toast was the heavy powdered sugar probably to cover up the horrible taste.  Stay away!",

The waitstaff have the social graces of a high school anime club member. We kept reminding them to bring things we ordered to the table.  The denver omelette was fine, nothing I'd wrote home about. A bit overstuffed as the peppers and onions did nothing but slip out. The poatoes were terribly underseasoned. I have no idea if they're going for a low sodium thing but one bite made me reach for the salt shaker immeadiatly. The homestyle, french fries, and hashbrowns were all like this.  My sib got steak and eggs, medium rare on the meat. However whoever puts it down on the grill needs to learn to pick it up- clearly over well done.  The tuna melt was more of a tuna crisp. Though the chilaquiles were ok; they know how to cook egg whites.",

We both decided this would be it.  This place is what they all say it is.  From the waitresses to the dishes.  Service here is kind and prompt.  Has an old diners kinda feel.  Organized but could use some more detailed cleanliness with the on your table things -- such as your jam holder, etc.  Some of them were sticky and some light dust stuck to them.  But overall the food was fantastic.    I ordered the Texas Omelet:  Has homemade chili and lots of cheddar.   Chili was hearty, smooth and cooked perfectly.  The amount of Cheddar they put in this sucker is perfect.  Perfect ratio.   The bread in a pot was good but not as moist and soft as I thought it would be. Sadly. Because I was so excited to try this cute little thing of bread.   I ordered the orange cream--- the frosting was good.  But that was it-- no biggie.   The boyfriend enjoyed himself the  Jamms omelette--- their specialty.   I had a bite and ohhhhhh goodness was it delicious. I'm having that next time we come to have breakfast.  The meat was very tender, juicy, and was paired perfectly with the sauce that is placed on top.  Creamy. It was so so good.  He also ordered himself 1 S'mores pancake.    It looked to me as if it was too sweet.  I'm more of an original pancake kinda girl.  I don't like my pancake smothered with sugar upon sugar.  But he made me take a bite and to my surprise it was actually not overwhelmingly sweet.  There was balance.  You could actually still taste the pancake.  Was actually really good.    All in all.  Was a great visit.  Loved it.  Will be coming back.   Our total bill was 26$, not bad.  You won't leave hungry and your pocket will still feel full.  Can't beat that.",

The butter has rancid tasting oil added and ruined the taste of all the food. We were all complaining to each other that the food tasted greasy. Then we tasted the butter separately and that was it. Ruined everything!  French toast was a complete disappointment. No pina colada French toast that was advertised. Also the website stated 10% off for social media posting.  The Waitress told us that was no longer happening. They really need to update the website. Not worth the time or money. Very disappointing in every aspect. Mc Donald's is better. Pot of bread was flavorless yeast ball in a tin. HGTV did me wrong on this place.  Stay away unless you like the grease of a greasy spoon. Old fashion, outdated, and disgusting.",

It disappoints me that I have to drive to the other side of town to find places like this - can someone please get on that and start expanding to Henderson? We only have \"fancy\" breakfast places in this area!  Anyhow, this is more of a \"divey\" kind of place - nothing fancy. It's loud, crowded and full of hustle and bustle. The food was great, the service was OK (not a big deal) and the prices were great. Our daughter enjoyed sharing my meal with me (she eats a lot for a little girl!).   Don't let the wait scare you off - we were originally told it would be around 30 minutes, but ended up seated almost immediately because people in front of us either left or didn't have their entire party there (everyone in your party must be present before they will sit you). Also, the tables turn over quickly.",

Whether you took it on the chin like a champ or whether you saw stars and started bawling like a baby - There are places in the world you can go that will make you feel better about that punch to the face you just absorbed.  -Mine is Jamms.  Friendly smiles as soon as you walk in the door and an atmosphere to match. The menu items include Breakfast and Lunch options. I'm slowly working through them.  As of yet: French Toast: with the option of with or without crunchy cornflake topping. Additional options:  How bout Nutella French Toast, Apple Cinnamon French Toast, too name a few  You Like Waffles? Jamms like waffles too... so much they make a WAFFLE PIZZA!  Omelette anyone They have over 10 different types.    A new item: Their breakfast burrito that will make you question all others.  This place is real a Gem.   After a French Press coffee and Banana Fosters pancakes I always leave feeling much better than how I came in.  That is the magic of Jamms.  Don't believe me?  Order their Pot' O Bread for the day and you too will be saying,\"What Punch to the Face?\"  They get busy, and rightfully so, but it is worth the short wait for the quality service and food you will experience.  Jamm On ;-)  .",

Our food has always been fresh and delicious and we have loved everything we've tried. Our two year old loves coming here too; they give her a bucket of crayons and coloring pages and she's set.

We were on our way to jamms. I didn't expect much but when we came it the place was packed but we were seated within 10 minutes. Great menu with great prices. I got the hungry lion breakfast. 2 eggs 2 bacon 2 sausage and ham 2 pancakes.  It was amazing. Best pancakes ever.  Also the potted bread it out of this world good.  So if you're looking for s place away from the strip for breakfast I would highly recommend Jamms",

The highlight is the \"everybody knows your name\" service. The place is packed with regulars, and everyone knows everyone, which is super charming. For the food, my omelet was filled generously, but the overall flavor and stiffness factor weren't my ideal. I think I need to try something other than an omelet next time. Note: They serve Illy coffee, and you can even have it in a French press.  But, what I really wanted to let you know is that on Fridays they have fish and chips, and my husband went googley-eyed and inhaled the giant pieces of fish filet with boyish delight. Our waitress said they usually sell out before the end of the day, so get there early!",

They serve their homemade bread in it's own little dish, have you ever heard of anything so cute?  Everything was fresh, comfy seating, friendly staff and top notch delicious fluffy pancakes. If you don't love a good fluffy pancake then you must be a monster. Go to Jamms now. Go on. Calories don't count there, or at least that's what I tell myself.",

Expect to wait at least 15 to 20 minutes  for a table then 10 minutes more once you sit down to order because it is that popular and busy.  They have very tasty food and they are humongous portions. We ordered chicken fingers for the kids and the flavoring was really good and they we very crispy.  My husband ordered a bowl of their homemade chicken noodle soup and it was really good and the serving is over 2 cups. I ordered the French dip and it was super yummy, normal size but still yummy. This place has 2 very unique things you can do for a discount and a free item. If you check in on yelp, you can get their pot of bread and if you do get the cinnamon raisin bread, you won't regret it. To score a discount all you have to do is clean your plate. Sounds easy but it can be a challenge because of the huge portions. I highly recommend this place. A must eat in Las Vegas.",

I'll wait for a good meal, no problem  Problem was - the service was horrendous -- and so was the food.  It took the waitress 15 minutes to get to our table after being seated to ask us for drinks.  After we put in our drink order, it took another 10 minutes for us to actually get our drinks.  We spent so much time looking around trying to flag someone down (just with looks as I despise the whole hand waving thing that people do).    When our drinks finally came, the waitress asked if we were ready to order.  As I ordered, she rushed me through any questions that I had.  For example, her question -- \"wouldyoulikebreakfastpotatoeshashbrownsortoast\"  She ran that sentence so quickly, I automatically \"uhh....-ed\" my reply.  When I said \"breakfast pota----\" she cut me off with a huff and replied, \"it has onions and peppers and is stir fried.\"    Anyhow, she continued on being rude, abrasive and hasty.  But enough about the ordering fiasco.  When I got my \"signature\" omelet - the \"signature\" sauce was dabbled on.  I mean, it literally looked like the cook took a teaspoon of the sauce and drizzled it over the omelet and left it be.  I asked for extra sauce.  The extra sauce arrived.  It was disgusting.  It tasted like clumpy flour boiled in egg yolk.  The omelet itself was dry and overcooked.  The steak inside of it was bland, chewy and grey.  My fiance's eggs benedict.  Disgusting as well.  No other way to put it.    My niece ordered mac & cheese.  She said it was really dry and wanted to pour her milk in it.  Serious?  After our \"meal\" was over we paid our bill and walked on out.  The hostess tried to give us a discount of 15% for a future visit.  I politely told her she could keep it.",

    "text": "I really wasn't impressed. My husband and I stopped in on a Wednesday morning on a recent trip to Vegas, we were seated immediately by a friendly hostess. I was really excited to try it due to the great reviews, it's a way off the strip and wasn't worth the drive.   I had the Breakfast Combo thing with eggs, ham, sausage, bacon, and pancakes. The pancakes were doughy and not cooked through, the eggs were a spongy egg-replacement, and the rest was average.   My hubby had the Corned Beef Hash Eggs Benedict at the waiter's recommendation and it was really slimy and the English muffin basically drowned and dissolved in all of the sauce. His hashbrowns were greasy and left a lot to be desired.   We ordered the S'mores pancake to try it and it was just a pancake with chocolate chips and marshmallows sprinkled on top, it was gross. Our waiter didn't take it off our tab or bring us the cinnamon raisin pot of bread we ordered.   Not worth coming back, and no clue why it is so highly rated. Cost us $25+ so not cheap diner food either...",

The omlette part was a bit skimpy & it was bursting with bacon (some slightly crispy, some slightly undercooked)-almost too much bacon but the avocados were PERFECTO! Perfectly ripe and huge luscious slices. Sadly my potatoes were undercooked and very greasy  : (  The Pot O bread was great as usual.    My hubby ordered the irish skillet.  He said it tasted \"fine\" but from my view it also looked undercooked in places and I was not even tempted to ask for a bite as I normally do.    I liked our waitress-we have had her a few times (I don't recall her name).  I asked about the potatoes.  She advised us to order extra crispy but did not offer to take them back... Maybe we could have had a small adjustment?    This is the closest place to where we live.  I think we will put our other places back in rotation for now.",

And so we did. Well worth it.   In a strip mall, and perfect size. Also very popular! So recommended times to show up, try around 8:30, after 9 you have a 15 min wait. which is well worth it. The decor is fun and light. The staff is incredibly nice, which was awesome. The menu has a lot to chose from, which can be hard to chose from. LOL.. I got the chicken freid steak, which was delicious, and the girlfriend got the multi grain pancakes, which where awesome, I had a few bites and was hooked. The second time we went there I ordered the jamms french toast, which is french toast covered in con flakes, it was awesome.. The girlfriend loved the multi grain pancakes so much, she got that again. Fresh coffee, and the staff was on top of refilling the cups non stop. Bottom line, its the local spot for breakfast. So if youre looking for a pretty cheap and quick breakfast, hit up Jamms!!!",

Eggs cooked to perfection and huge fluffy pancakes. The country fried steak was reminiscent of that served in my school cafeteria, terrible. Biscuits were perfect and the gravy was pretty good.

It's nice to know that I've got options if I don't want a Grand Slam breakfast from Dennys.   My husband and I came here for one of our Sunday breakfasts. I'm a fan of Corned Beef Hash so when I read Russ V's review on it I decided to give it a try. I liked this corn beef because it wasn't salty and I knew it was fresh because it didn't have the mushy consistency that canned corned beef has. My order came with scrambled eggs, and house fries with a side of sourdough bread. I'm a little weird when it comes to breakfast I usually will put the eggs and the corned beef hash on the toast. Once the toast runs out I save the rest and take it home. Corned beef on top of white rice is yummy! The portions are huge here so there is enough for like three small meals! I was also very full because before the meal came out we had the free Cinnamon Pot bread. Just mention Yelp and you too can get a free one! It was slightly salty on the top but once you get inside the bread it's nice and soft. It's tastes really good with coffee.   My husband had the Sandy Omelet that comes with bacon, tomato, avocado, sour cream and cheddar cheese. I sampled the omelet and it was really good too! It reminded me of the Cracked Egg's North Shore Scramble but in a Omelet.",

I've also had the Jamm's French toast (coated in crunched corn flakes) and a few of their breakfast sandwiches. I have never been disappointed and will always come back!!",

I am so glad we did not only does this place have a cute atmosphere but it also has amazing food. The service is impeccable and everyone is so nice and always smiling. When you first walk in you can smell the yummy goodness of the pot of bread cooking and your senses come alive. It's not a very big place and there's usually a line but it moves pretty quick. I suggest if there is a line waiting because you won't be disappointed with the food. Most everything they have is great and I've tried quite a few of their items on the menu. But their signature items are a must try as well. The jamms French toast which is dipped in cornflakes is my absolute favorite. You also have to try the pot of bread!!!  They have the  cinnamon pot of bread With cream cheese icing and they also have seasonal flavors which no matter what you have to try those as well. This has become one of our favorite breakfast places . They're open from 7 AM to 3 PM every day as it's just breakfast and lunch. So if you haven't tried this place you must go by and try the food.",

Husband ordered their egg/bacon/pancake special and asked for 3 eggs and both the bacon and the sausage even if extra. She brought out 1 and 1 and 2 eggs. My husband asked about the eggs and said he wanted 2 bacon and 2 sausages and I said it's ok if it's extra  and the waitress told him 3 times that he didn't order that. Why sit there and debate what she heard or understood. Just say ok and add it. That was a big turn off. My daughter ordered chicken and waffles and it was a joke. It came with 2 chicken nuiget looking strips straight out of some box. We've had chicken and waffles at Rocco's and Metro and this was a joke. The pancakes, french toast and grits were fine. We saw some sandwich orders come out and maybe that's their forte because they looked better than what we had",

Maybe it's what we ordered, but we will not be returning any time soon.  3 stars: The prices are reasonable. The place was clean. The staff was friendly and attentive.  Where they really disappointed was the food. I ordered a Belgian waffle combo, eggs and sausage. The eggs were sad (overcooked and lifeless), sausage was ok, and the waffle was cold and tough. My husband ordered the chicken fried steak, it came with country potatoes and eggs. He said it was just ok but the sausage gravy, that makes the dish, was no good.  I know they ask if everything is good, but how could I say we didn't really enjoy any of it? Normally I do speak up, but when you just don't like their food, it really can't be fixed. We were hungry, so we politely nodded and ate.",

We took a look at the menu and there weren't too many options but luckily we weren't looking for anything extravagant.   My mom ordered a short stack and I ordered a corn beef skillet with a side of a pot of bread. The pot of bread came out first, which was perfect since I was a bit hungry. It was a nice filler for the wait for our food.   Our food came out and it looked good! Only thing I would say about my skillet was that it was a little salty? But I assumed that come from the saltiness of the corned beef. I did notice the potatoes were a bit over seasoned so it could be from that. My mom was satisfied with her short stack but it's kind of hard to mess that up!   All in all, Jamms is a good place for a quick breakfast with a friend or family member. Make sure to get a pot of bread you'll be pleasantly filled!",

It was so tasty and good! I also had  cabbage soup and a half Turkey sandwich. It was cold in the restaurant, the soup warmed me up and was delicious. The Turkey sandwich with sourdough bread was also good. It hit the spot for a light lunch. My husband had Chefs Salad with ham, turkey and cheese. He enjoyed it.

The inside consisted of two previously frozen processed chicken strips; they were lukewarm.  The lettuce, tomato, and bacon tasted good, but the thin, processed chicken was too much of a detractor.    The Jamms salad on the side was very good!  Maybe I just ordered the wrong thing, but a restaurant with this high of a rating shouldn't be serving the cheapest-available processed and shaped chicken strips.  I will also add that all of the staff was very friendly and attentive!  They're the only reason why I didn't give Jamms a lower rating.",

Their french toast contains cornflakes which was cool and gives a crunchy consistency. It was pretty good, but I think I prefer the original kind that has cinnamon.  Service was good - the waitress was friendly and attentive, as well as the bussers.  The best part about this restaurant is their pot of bread!",

We found this place on the Yelp app because we were sightseeing Vegas in the morning and it was worth the 20 minute drive to get here for a real breakfast. My heart flipped over When I saw the Texas omelette; chili and cheese omelette with hashbrowns. #MyFavoriteBreakfastEver The coffee is good and comes in really big hearty mugs. Service was old-school efficient and friendly by a lady who reminded me of Flo from that old show Alice (I mean that in the sweetest way!!) The bus boy kept us with hot coffee  and Cold water and cleared our plates quickly. We made friends with two tables around us, even. Mom loved her \"pot of bread\" cinnamon raisin bread.",

Or when you spend the jam it falls right into the bread. Luv this place not loud and the staff is always attentive. Awesome menu. If you haven't been here and you go.

    "text": "I'm not usually disappointed with restaurants, but after continuous rave reviews and legends of the Pot of Bread, I think I expected a little more than meh.   I went into Jamms with an open mind and was immediately struck by the prices. Over $2 for hollandaise? $2.75 for coffee? Almost all entrees at least $10? Jamms at least makes it up to you by providing a large portion for every full size meal you order. However, on a light wallet, I decided to stick to their small plates menu, which was actually quite a good value.   For $4, I got half of a Smores waffle, complete with honey, chocolate chips, and marshmallows. The toppings were great: it's hard to screw up chocolate and marshmallows, after all. However, the waffle was shockingly stale. Every bite I took, it seemed as if it was getting harder and harder to chew, until eventually, I was having a hard time even cutting the waffle into pieces. Luckily, the chocolate and honey masked the almost tasteless and stale waffle. Still: not a good sign.  Next, for $5, I chose the option of the Reuben Benedict, a supposed fan favorite take on the typical eggs benedict. It was your typical benedict, with an english muffin, an egg, and hollandaise. This version, however, replaced the Canadian bacon with some corned beef. (Thank god: I eventually tried the normal egg benedict, and the ham was chewy and cold.) For a signature menu item, it fell flat. The english muffin had a strange rancid taste, and the corned beef was lacking in both amount and flavor. While the Canadian bacon might have a worse taste, it at least was a better value!  My girlfriend had the Bananas Foster pancakes, and while I personally didn't try them, she commented on the poor quality bananas and insisted that the IHOP version was superior.  Finally, my ultimate disappointment was in the $1.95 Pot of Bread. This is the thing Jamms is known for. It's the thing I was excited for, and the thing I had heard so much about from my companions. And, unfortunately, it was the thing that sucked the most. I ended up with the cinnamon raisin pot, but the expanded bread on top was stale and difficult to eat. For such a small pot, I was amazed at the struggle. It simply tasted old, and I wondered how long it had been sitting in the kitchen. The only \"soft\" part was at the very bottom, and there surely wasn't much to go around. The cinnamon doesn't add much, but I shudder to think of how it tasted without it. I also tried some of the peppermint Pot of Bread, and while it was remarkably better, it may have been because of the outlandish amount of frosting coated on the bread. The Pot of Bread may have been the worst $2 I've spent all month, and, quite frankly, the free bread at Outback has far more flavor and is actually consumable.   Jamms was a fun attempt at trying something new, but breakfast foods can be hard to get right, especially with such a limited menu. The service was great, but I had hoped for a bit more. Instead, I left wishing I had gone to Denny's.",

That is excellent customer service and really shows they care about the experience of their customers.   We came back and the experience was better. We both ordered something different this time. I had the Wild West Burger and she had the French Toast. The burger was cooked as I liked it at. The chili that came with it was good. I tried the french toast and it was cooked great!  Here's what I've found in my two experiences here: They have a wonderful staff who are friendly and seem dedicated to customer service. The food is cooked very well. Everything is cooked exactly how it should be. But my problem is the food does not wow me. There isn't any thing unique or special about it. The food isn't bad, it's just not something worth 4 or 5 stars.",

    "text": "First and foremost, the staff here is just delightful! They have a regular crowd, everybody knows each others names, it's really welcoming. They're always very friendly, even when busy, and they take care of you as if you were family.  I've been here a handful of times as it's close to campus and I focus better in class when I'm happily stuffed. I've gotten breakfast all but one time in which I ordered the French Onion Soup and a salad and it was a total miss!  The French Onion Soup has a light broth with way too much thyme in it. The bread was a cheap generic white bread, so it got sort of slimy once it soaked up the broth. The onions were a thick slice and were not meltingly soft. The salad which was Jamms House Salad was a cabbage salad with an \"Asian\" dressing. By cabbage salad, I mean, chopped green cabbage. That's it. The dressing itself was alright with some sesame oil and rice wine vinegar, but it was too heavy on the sugar.  That being said, the only thing I've eaten here for breakfast is omelets! The reason? Simple: The cheese. Oh my goodness, the cheese!! The omelets here are delicious but they definitely cheat by adding A LOT of cheese, which I'm a total sucker for. I usually eat healthy breakfasts, but the cheesy omelets here do me in every time. So much cheese you have to chew it well. It's glorious! The Margie is my favorite omelet they have. It comes stuffed with mushrooms, tomatoes and artichoke hearts. Sometimes I add green peppers, sometimes I add spinach, but I always get egg whites which is a slight up charge ($1). They saute the vegetables before putting them in the omelets, so the tomato gets a little cooked which I love. It comes with your choice of potato (fries, hashbrowns, home fries) and bread.  Their bread selection is unique in that they offer a \"pot of bread.\" If you like dinner rolls, you'll love this. Their pots of bread are really soft, pillowy, yeasty white breads. They offer seasonal flavors (I once had a divine raspberry and lemon), white, and cinnamon. Or you can get toast of course. I usually get fruit instead of potatoes and no toast or bread (at an up charge $3). The fruit here is always a medley of melon.  Great service, and amaaaazing gooey cheesy omelets! Coffee is decent.. just decent.",

I'm also guessing the exact same employees work there now since i first tried JAMMS in 2008.  As the gf and I walked in we debated whether or not the place was freshened up with new paint - i generally don't look at decor but given our upcoming move to a new house and being bombarded by all the design/decor ideas coming from the gf for the new house, i've suddenly taken a closer look.  As usual, the service is spot on - water and coffee at our table within a minute, Flo taking our order within minutes and the food served within minutes ... honest !   Gf standard breakfast - veggie omelet - no seasoning, no oil , packed with 4-6 veggies, and of course, egg whites - given the large number of veggies, her food usually costs between $12-$15 at the various breakfast places we visit.  Surprisingly, no extra charge for the garden of veggies that the gf requested - but a $1.50 upcharge for the fruit side.  I believe her omelet cost $10.  She proclaims JAMMS is the only breakfast spot that consistently prepares her omelet correctly.  My ham and cheese omelet ?  All good - i like that they put the cheese on top the omelet AND inside the omelet.    IF we lived closer to JAMMS ( and with the upcoming move, we will ) I suspect this will be one of our top breakfast spots.  pics included",

A side, however, is a bigger portion than an actual meal order, so prepare for that if you try to order sides as taste testers. Overall, the food was satisfting. The service was completely alright. Our food took about 20+ minutes to get to our table and there seemed to be confusion every time drinks were discussed. But, they were pretty busy, so I'll blame it on that. Overall, i liked it. I'll bring people here for some hearty and tasty food. Can't complain too much about the service, especially if they are so busy.",

If you don't have access to a car consider renting one to drive to this gem. The \"pot of bread\"  (preferably flavored) with the honey butter is mandatory eating. My wife and I both had the make your own omelette ($9.99) which comes with a \"pot of bread\" and choice of potatoes. (Consider a little basket of sweet potato fries if you want something different than hash browns.) I planned on attaching pics of the food, but after one taste it was gone before I remembered that I wanted to take pics. Don't tell anyone about this place otherwise it will likely he too crowded as more people venture to this prized breakfast location.",

Note, the bus 'persons' (red shirt) takes your drink order, but not your food order. You need to flag down a server (black shirt) for that. Waffle is soft not crispy.

    "text": "I have been to this hole in the wall several times now and I am always pleased and satisfied with what I choose. First let me mention there are a ton of options so it may take you awhile to choose. Also the portions are large-size so come with an appetite or be prepared to take leftovers. I was please to find they added tapas portions, smaller plate styles at half the cost.      This particular time I got the Rueben omelette (corned beef,sauerkraut, and Swiss cheese.) The tender corned beef really went well with the tangy sweetness of the sauerkraut. Also I got the pot of bread (cinnamon and raisin with side of cream cheese icing) yummy! They did come out with a pistachio pot of bread I'm dieing to try. When you check in on yelp they give you a free pot of bread but they said they were out of pistachio which is odd because they offered it to the table next to us so I don't know. Nonetheless my meal was great.     Now my boyfriend ordered the steak and eggs. I warned him about ordering steak at a place that doesn't really specialize in that bc you can't expect much from a small breakfast joint but he took the risk lol. Of course I was right the steak looked like a chewed up oversized piece of bacon. He said it was tough, chewey, and tasted kind of like an old belt. However the scrambled eggs were plain and to be expected. The pancakes were really good and fluffy.     Overall everything was great on my behalf and you cant beat the cost we spent under $30. Word of advice stick with breakfast it's what they are known for and don't order the steak.....obviously.",

    "text": "Trying out a new breakfast spot in town was a good choice. Although this is in a shady neighborhood, don't judge a book by it's cover. What's inside is what counts. There was a short wait but as we were there I notice the wait got longer and there was a steady flow of customers coming in. I also noticed waitresses that spoke to customers by name, telling me there are regulars here. Those were all good signs to start.   I got the veggie omelette which is my go to breakfast item of choice. This omelette really impressed me with large chunks of vegetables. They also cooked the onion and bell pepper prior to putting it in the omelette. I really liked this extra step and appreciated it. Having ordered this at many different restaurants, I can say that this was above the rest when it comes to giving me some actual veggies I can see in my omelette. Other places it is just tiny chopped pieces of veggies with no veggie taste. I also really enjoyed the hash browns. The bread that came with it I was not that impressed with. It was kind of dry and bland. We had the cinnamon.   We also ordered red velvet pancakes to compare to others we have had, and these were different. They were huge, really thick and fluffy, and a little on the \"less sweet\" side which is a good or bad thing, depending on what you want.   Service was good and quick. I think this is a good choice for a simple all American breakfast.",

The advertised pot of bread was under-cooked and tasteless. The veggie omelette was watery. The coffee was bitter and watered down. Not what I had in mind after reading the reviews.  The waitress was very sweet but her service did not continue to the front of the restaurant. The cashier was not polite. She refused to give me a receipt that showed paid for my cash transaction. I do not think this is standard practice of restaurant sales. Why would she not be able to give me a receipt showing paid in cash? Is there a reason why this specific restaurant cannot provide a customer with a paid receipt? I was not content with their overall experience.  For the price and the reviews ... I expected more.  Will not return nor recommend.",

Our waitress Sandy came by not to long after we received our drinks to take our order.   We were there early so it wasn't quite as packed as it usually is on a Sunday. I loved seeing those with their football jerseys on. The new paint on the door and Windows is fabulous I love Frankenstein.   My husband had the California Benedict with home fries. It was beautiful to look at. He said it was glorious. It had a fresh taste but was also rich with their hollandaise sauce that he loves so much. The tomato and avocado were perfectly ripe. I had my usual French toast combo. The bacon was extra crisp exactly how I like it. They have a Jamms French toast or a traditional both are good options but I do prefer the traditional. My eggs were over medium, which is what I asked for. We also shared their weekly pot of bread this week it was pineapple pumpkin. My husband  greatly enjoyed the pot of bread, but it was my favorite but that's the joy of having a different flavors to try every week.   We love that they offer discounts of you check in on social media or yelp. Our waitress was very attentive throughout the entire meal and we were very satisfied with our experience there as always.",

This was very disappointing! The waffle was good, but nothing out of the ordinary. There were only two pieces of what seemed like frozen chicken fingers, overcooked and bland. Pass!   Yes, I know they aren't a Soul Food kind of place, so my expectations weren't too high, but looking at all the other positive reviews, as well as all the personal recommendations (the reason I was there in the first place), I was underwhelmed.

Our server was the best part of our experience. I believe her name was Sandy. She, unlike the hostess, was very welcoming, friendly and answered all of our questions as first time guests. Our food (including gratis Pots of Bread) was brought out promptly, so we appreciated that.  My Waffle Benedict meal was a 3/5.  Pepper flavor of the home fries was a little overpowering. Waffle was light and fluffy, Hollandaise was creamy and flavorful. But the Canadian bacon was way too thick for a Benedict. It was like chewing on a piece of leather. In my humble opinion, Kailyn's Kitchen still wins for best Benny in town. In addition, I have to add that I was not offered a refill of coffee until our check came. Big deal. They would've scored those points back had they provided a restaurant-style thermos with more coffee at the table, if they're too busy to check up on us...come on, even IHOP does that. Yes, I went there.  We were passed with the check and thanked by Sandy. No message to pay at the register, so we sat awkwardly with our payment for several minutes before having to figure it out ourselves. We get to see the lovely hostess again, who says nothing as we give her our card and check. \"Would you like your receipt?\" Is this McDonald's? Yes we would. Handed our check without so much as have a nice day.  Perhaps it was an off day for these people. Unfortunately not a great impression was left for us as first timers. Consistency is the key to the success of a small business, and if you can't master that art, you will miss out on a lot of opportunity.",

On the way to a 2nd suggested place, Warren P. found Jamms and since it was nearby, I piloted the car to Jamms.  What a nice stop for idea #3.  The three of us started out with a free pot of bread, just for mentioning Yelp.  They have plain, cinnamon, and the flavor of the day was green chili and cheese which is what I got.  It comes with a cup of softened butter and was tasty.  I had the S'mores pancake.  That's pancake batter with marshmallow and chocolate chips in the batter.  It's topped with some extra chocolate chips--for good measure-- that soften from the hot pancake.  There is also a drizzle of caramel sauce on the pancake.  I got the single pancale and it was a perfect ending to a great hike.  Service was excellent.  I'll be back here for sure!",

My only real complaint about this place is the grits (way too watery) and the fact that many minor issues will come up if you have a special prep on your order (like simple substitutions or asking to leave items off) if they are busy. Don't think this is an waitress issue as its pretty consistent so maybe the kitchen is just willing to take the recourse. They really are minor but then again, I don't have allergies. That may be an issue for someone else.",

I ordered a Denver omelette and the country potatoes, of course the raisin cinnamon cup of bread.   Yikes I was not aware they loaded their omelette's with cheese, was a bit overwhelming to say the least. They saute the Denver ingredients to oblivion, onions, ham and which should be green bell pepper as for a \"traditional\" Denver omelette, they used red. I like my Denver omelette with a bit more crunch of the onion and bell pepper. Way too much cheese about 1/2 pound it seemed, was basically a cheese omelette with some ingredients. It was insane the amount of cheese.  Anyhow, I will be sweating cheese for the next week, eek.   The country potatoes and cup of bread was awesome, and the coffee is also good with plenty of refills.   I will give them another shot and order something different next time, perhaps the french toast.  I have to say the service was awesome! We had a waitress that was sweet, charming and on top of things! She is one of those that calls you sweetie, honey, etc. I love that and eat it up, she got a hefty tip! lol",

They do indeed turn tables quickly, but at no time did we feel rushed. The staff hustles, our waitress was efficient and cheerful, the coffee was hot and eye-opening.  My daughter had Jamm's French Toast which is battered then encrusted with corn flakes before frying. She says I will have to make mine this way from now on. I had Jamm's Speciality Omelet which has steak, grilled onions and mushrooms and lots of mild cheddar. Guests get their choice of hash browns or home fries and a bread selection - English muffin, toast, their signature pot o'bread. I chose the home fries and the special of the day pot o'bread with cream cheese frosting.   The long and short of it is that we both left stuffed and happy, several wait staff wished us a good day and that we'd be back soon. We don't get to Vegas very often (about every 2-3 years) but we will certainly come back to Jamm's again.",

The portions are more reasonable than Hash House delivers, which we appreciate and the price tag is less than hash house too. This mom and pop place has more of a truck stop feel and the fair is unique and special. Things you won't experience anywhere else. I love the little bread bowls with fun flavors of the week to choose from. The bread melts in your mouth. The hot chocolate is wonderful. And I haven't had a bad breakfast item yet. They have some really nice variations on how eggs are done. The flavors are homemade and wonderful. I haven't tried lunch or dinner here yet but breakfast is always the bomb!

Our server was wonderful. She was attentive but never rushed us, which I really appreciated.   I ordered the chicken panini. I'm not convinced the chicken was cooked all the way, so I pretty much peeled it out of the sandwich. The bread was far too crisp, and I am pretty certain there was not any pesto on it. I was severely disappointed. The potato wedges were good, but they're like any you can buy frozen.   Overall, I won't be back. Sorry, Jamms.",

But just like your gramm gramm's house, you tend to eat all the food because it's just that good.   No fancy frills, just down home cooking that's definitely not diet friendly, especially with what I decided to eat, The Country Skillet. A heart stopping meal filled with scrambled eggs, sausage, ham, onions, mushrooms and covered in home fries with gravy. I also got the Pot of Bread, which is on the house with a Yelp check-in, free carbs!  The skillet is huge and a very heavy meal that's perfect for sharing or that horrendous hangover that just won't seem to go away. The home fries added a great crunchy texture, which is definitely what this plate of needed with so many soft food items. Gravy, gravy, gravy, it was the perfect addition to the mushrooms and eggs and brought everything together.   Like I said a free \"Pot of Bread\" with a Yelp check-in, and they offer three choices; original, cinnamon raisin and a savory flavor that I believe rotates.  I went with the basic \"POB\" and it was amazing. Soft, pillowy, and all of that melt in your mouth goodness, trust me check-in and be happy.   Jamms is well, the Jam!",

Um...yeah it's scrumdillicious.   I got the Jamm's French Toast.  It was really good. It really would have been hit out of the ball park with real maple syrup, but no one around here serves anything other than Aunt Jemima or Mrs. Butterworth and being from upstate NY where they serve nothing but the real stuff, I am a bit of a spoiled brat...I can dream about it being smothered in real maple syrup...it was still very satisfying with knock off syrup.  I got home fries with a side of sour cream. At first it looked a little unappetizing but looks can be deceiving. Best home fries I have had and that is saying a lot since the competition around these parts is stiff.  The coffee is strong.  Like STRONG! I needed sugar and more than I normally use...I asked for more sugar and they don't mess around...   So basically the next time I come here while everyone's food-seeing the omelettes almost made me want to change my mind and one of those, looked amazing I am seriously coming here just to engorge myself on pot of breads and potatoes.   Yes, come here, do it.",

The rating dropped because during us dining in, a waitress (?) came up to me and my boyfriend and put her arms around us. She told me to quit using the \"f bomb\" because it was a \"family friendly\" restaurant. I was in such shock that I didn't say anything (I also cannot stand to be touched by anyone that I do not know). It was so uncomfortable.   First of all, that's assault. You had NO RIGHT to touch us. The fact you even did is reprehensible. It was uncomfortable, unprofessional, and I have PTSD that could make it where I'll have a panic attack and freak out. That isn't very family friendly, now is it?  Second of all, my right to free speech trumps everyone else's feelings, and if you have an issue with that, go fuck yourself. Not to mention it was so loud in there the only people who could hear me were right next to me!  Thirdly, this is Vegas. If you're going to tell me that none of those parents curse in front of their children, you're stupid. What makes a stranger saying it any different? Get off your high horse.",

We appreciate a good cup of coffee--nothing pretentious, just a decent complement to the food. Again, the breakfast selections are varied and it does take time to settle on something from the menu. Orders included the grilled corned beef hash & eggs, which was savory with a nice crunchy exterior; the iconic Joe's Omelet with fresh spinach and plenty of beef and mushrooms; fluffy pancakes and eggs cooked exactly as requested.   Our visitors were happy with being brought to this local spot to have a very satisfying breakfast.   By the time we left, there was a line of people waiting to get in. The usual Sunday morning scene. But it's worth the wait.",

I wanted to try a place in the same strip mall and I won't give the name because that's another review.  Let's just say they sell poultry cooked different ways.  I let you do the math.  As I was bummed out driving I see a window blasted with \"Best of Vegas\" stickers.  I was about to eat my foot so we decided to stop in to the breakfast/lunch establishment.  As we were walking in I noted the best of stickers were kind of old.  I figured well it can't be that bad.    We walked in  and were immediately greeted.  If I were to base the review only on the service and how friendly the employees are, then I would give it more stars.  The waitress was friendly and the guy who was filling our drinks was even more friendly.  Our 1 year old was a little fussy because she was probably hungry too.  They noticed this and brought us some crackers.  This was great!  If you are a waiter or waitress and notice a fussy kid and you know the little things that help parents then you instantly max out your tip.  Just a little piece of advise, go ahead and write that down.    Let's take a look at the food.  I ordered the Jamm's omelet.  It had steak in it covered with a sauce.  When I looked at the steak and keep in mind I am not expecting fillet Mignon here it looked like the steak um's meat you get in your freezer aisle.  I didn't like it at all.  I think I really didn't like it because the omelet was about $10.  I guess I was just expecting more.  I did get the pot bread and it was really good.  My wife ordered the french toast and she thought it was tasty.  My daughters just at eggs and toast.  We emerged from the restaurant paying $30 for breakfast.  Ouch!  Overall I am sure at one time this place was great but as new restaurants opened it probably took away from this place.  There are a lot better breakfast places out there. Cheers!",

The Country Skillet was delicious and well balanced. There was a good amount of meat/egg/potato mixed together (some skillets at other places are 70% potato and few ingredients). The scrambled eggs were fresh and fluffy. Their omelets are also hefty. The Sandy Omelet packs in a lot of flavor and should satisfy your hunger.  All in all, an easy and pleasant experience.",

I have actually been going there for years, and have noticed how service, and the food was going down hill. Everything is greasy. I mean everything. Today was crowded I will give them that. But the service sucked. And to top it all off I ordered a sandwich to take home with me. Now I know leaving it behind on the table in a doggie bag was my fault. I had returned no more than b a few minutes later to find out that they threw it away. I could deal with that.  But the way the they handled the situation with such a no care in the world to bad so sad attitude. Will guarantee that I will never go back to that hole in the wall sleazy place. You want a good clean classy place to have some breakfast. Go to the new York beagle cafe on buffalo.  You would never want to go back to jams agian.",

    "text": "This was my first time dining at Jamms and I was very impressed! My party and I came on a Saturday morning. The wait time was about 20 minutes, which we expected for a weekend. We were seated in less than 20 minutes.   The menu is huge! There was a ton of options and you can try many different items, which made it easier to decide. The 1st server came to our table and took our drink order. The drinks were brought back promptly. The 2nd server took a while to take our order. I could see that the server was busy, but an acknowledgement from the server would have been appropriate. The server took around order after about 10-15 minutes.  We ordered our meals and the famous pot of bread. That was absolutely delicious! It was fresh, warm, and tasteful. Our food arrived a little erratically. Myself and 3 others received our food while the 4th person had to wait another 5 minutes for his meal. We dug right in when we got our food, but felt bad that the other person had to wait.  The servers were very attentive with drink refills and pre-bussing our table. We received our check quickly and got cashed out fast.  Overall, I will definitely dine here again. The 1 star deduction is for the small wait time for our order to be taken and the wait time for our friend's food.",

My hubby had the hash and eggs which was probably the best we have ever eaten and I had the chicken enchiladas with green sauce and they were excellent, not to spicy and not to mild. Only negative I would say is that the refried beans that came with enchiladas were a little dry but there was plenty of enchiladas to fill me up so I just didn't eat the beans. I would highly recommend this place.",

Eggs and pancakes were pretty good, nothing special, ham steak ok, bacon and sausage bad! Bacon chewy like rubber and the sausage was unlike any other I've ordered in a restaurant. They were the kind you get at the cheap breakfast buffets that are snappy and are kind of gross without much flavor. So, to sum up, not too impressed. Service was nice though :)",

We were greeted with a plate of fresh fruit while we browsed the menu and sipped our fresh coffee. This time I opted for the signature omlette and it was awesome. Sliced steak and bearnaise sauce with crispy hash browns and another little loaf of heaven. The service was great, as always. We had a couple of first timers with us and they were both impressed with the service and quality. One of them ordered a bowl of grits, which looked like a meal unto itself.

It was so good. The taste and texture of the bread reminded of a soft dinner roll, but the Oreo added a really nice sweetness, and it came with a side of sweet cream frosting/glaze. For our main breakfast dishes we ordered the Cornflake-crusted french toast, and the Irish Scramble, which is corned beef hash with peppers, onion, eggs, topped with cheddar cheese. Sounds yummy, right? Well, it was!  SERVICE: We went on a Tuesday morning just before 8am. We were seated immediately, and had great service throughout.

If you sign up for their e-mail list you can get coupons for 10-15 percent off your bill or a free pot of bread.  Anyway I recommend ordering the Irish skillet and a pot of bread.  I still haven't been able to find a great breakfast spot in Vegas, i've been to Cracked Egg, Egg & I, Hash House A Go Go, Babycakes, The Bagel Cafe, Blueberry Hill, Pancake House, etc. I like The Bagel Cafe, Blueberry Hill and Pancake House out of all of those but those are all pretty expensive and the Pancake Houses in other states are better than the ones here for some reason. Hash House is the worst out of all of those.",

There are so many good things on the menu it is always hard to decided. This time I wanted to do lunch and the NJ Sloppy Joe-a triple decker sandwich with pastrami,corned beef,and turkey w/cole slaw & 1000 island sounded good. BUT....  so did the French Dip sandwich with steak fries and au jus.  I got the latter and it was damn huge I knew right away I was at best gonna make it through Half.  The beef was tender & tasty. The Roll was soft and buttery but firm enough to hold up to being dipped.  The fries were seasoned and very tasty.  As expected I barely made it through half but there was no way I was leaving this one behind!  If you like that small town feeling when you go out to eat. THIS IS THE PLACE!",

    "text": "We came here for breakfast on a Vegas trip, my husband likes to find local mom and pop places rather than the usual tourist traps.  My son ordered the smores pancakes which are actually chocolate chip pancakes with caramel sauce and whip cream.  I tried a bite and they were delicious.  The pancakes were light, airy and chocolatey.  I was surprised they weren't overly sweet.  I ordered the french toast with strawberries.  It was very good with fresh strawberries instead of limp soggy thawed berries and they were plentiful.  The french toast is drudged in crushed cornflakes so they had a nice bite to them and no soggy bread.  My husband ordered the corn beef  hash, this is where they lost two stars.  What arrived looked like browned sliced pieces of lunchmeat.  He told me it was so salty he couldn't even taste anything else.  To make sure he wasn't being overly dramatic, I had a small taste.  OMG it was the saltiest thing I've ever eaten and I like salt.  I drank my entire drink after that small bite.  It literally tasted like someone spilled the entire salt container in the hash and fried my taste buds, glad I was done with my french toast.    Bottom line, don't go anywhere near that hash if you have functional taste buds and anything but perfect blood pressure.  Get the french toast.",

    "text": "Just tried out their night menu - they have an awesome selection of unique hamburgers, some other sandwiches and wraps, a few salads and a short list of appetizers.  The choices of sides are many - seasoned fries, skinny fries, sweet potato fries, potato salad, coleslaw, cabbage salad and a regular side salad.  The drink selection left something to be desired, but they do carry the essentials. (Coke products for sodas)  While the items are definitely not standard, it *is* a smaller overall menu than most places.  A recent addition (I don't remember seeing it on their lunch menu) is \"The Jamminator\" - a whopping 24 oz burger with your choice of toppings.  If you take the challenge and can eat it all in one sitting, they give you a free t-shirt.  After seeing how big their regular burgers are... that thing has to be monstrous.  I had the Egg Salad Burger.  (Yup - a 10 oz burger with a scoop of egg salad on top, plus the normal fixins.)  It was fantastic, but super big.  Definitely something to cut in half and take part home for later.  For my side I chose the sweet potato fries; they came spinkled with powdered sugar.  I think I could've just eaten a plate of those by itself and been satisfied.  Super delicious, and a nice sweet change-up from normal fries.  The waitstaff is super friendly, almost to a fault.  Great group of people, though.  Comparing what you get for the money you spend, this is easily one of my favorite diner-style restaurants in town.  Expect to spend about $15-$20 per person if you go all out with drinks and dessert.  It's definitely worth it.",

It's just the perfect amount so you don't just keep eating bread. My mom ordered eggs and ham Benedict and I ordered a build your burger. The eggs Benedict came with hash browns and my mom was happy with it, I didn't taste it so not sure- she wished it came with toast. On the burger you get a choice of 3 buns, 3 meats, cheeses, 3 toppings out of 8, and some sauce. I got provolone cheese, mushrooms, avocado and jalapeno mayo sauce. Tasted better than an average burger and I would come back for another one. I wished the jalapeno mayo was blended. It was literally mayo in a bowl and a chopped jalapeno in it haha I could've done that! Also I got wedge fries with the burger and these are probably the best fries I've ever had! They weren't greasy at all and I loved that they didn't have salt all over them! Soooo gooddd!  Ps if you post on social media they give you ten percent off your bill, it's on every table so don't miss out!",

Not feeling adventurous I chose the white bread over the orange creamsicle flavor of the day. The bread was super fresh, tasty and hot out of the oven. I loved it.  As for breakfast the three of us ordered biscuits and gravy, an order of the French toast sticks and a New York strip with eggs. All of the items were cooked perfectly including the medium rare strip steak. I will remember not to attempt to eat an entire order of biscuits and gravy again. The portion was huge.   I find their coffee mugs sizable and the staff is always available for a quick refill. This is a great spot for breakfast without a huge wait time. We hit them on Mother's Day weekend and the place was packed but there wasn't a line out the door or anything so we were promptly seated.",

The place is small, but what it lacks in size it makes up for in great service and food. Our waitress was a sweetheart! I ordered the cinnamon pot of bread and the corned beef hash breakfast.

Although there are a lot of options for this type of fare, Jamm's remains one of my favorites for a simple, but well prepared breakfast.  I have a couple of criterium for an acceptable breakfast restaurant, those including good coffee, has waffles, and offers crispy, shredded hash browns as a potato option.  Jamm's offers all of these (although I wish they had thinner waffles as well as Belgian).  They do; however, serve their coffee in a nice large mug and are somewhat known for their pots of bread (a sweet yeast roll marbled with different flavors).   My favorite order is the waffle with a side of their bacon. It's always served perfectly crisp. Although I do not eat eggs, the other half loves their omelets and always has a cinnamon raisin pot of bread.   Jamm's remains one of my go-to breakfast spots in Vegas because of their traditional menu, good service, and easy location. It does get very busy on the weekends, but it's easy to figure out when the wait will be the most manageable and try them... I'm sure it won't be your list visit!",

The food is just stupid good, even just an omelet is so so tasty  - not to mention they give you the option to make any omelet into a burrito- which I don't know about you - but the only thing that could make breakfast better is wrapping the whole damn thing up in a tortilla. Also their signature pot o' bread - YUMTASTIC. I love this unique element as it really sets their brand as a breakfast place apart from the rest. Sorry Denny's, I'll be at Jamms.",

They make their own bread there which is kind of cool.  The only reason they could not get 5 stars it was because the waitress that was serving us could not give us a clear answer on what was good. Has a first-time customer partner and I I asked her how was a particular item and the answer to each item was fantastic. If everything is fantastic I will not know what you decide so I got what she recommended was the best omelet in the house. I'm going to have to argue that it was kind of bland.

When my wife and I arrived we almost shied away from eating here because it looked very busy; there was a small group of people outside even. But that group disappeared fast so we went on in. We were greeted quickly, had our name taken down by the hostess and were seated in probably less than 10 minutes. Shortly after, we were brought some water. A few minutes after that our waitress came and grabbed our orders. I mentioned we had a coupon from Yelp for a free pot of bread for checking in. I showed her my phone and she returned a minute later with the orange cranberry version, which was really good; fresh and still warm.   For our orders, my wife got an omelette, hash browns and some toast. I got the Hungry Lion breakfast which is your standard breakfast platter of 2 eggs, 2 sausage links, 2  pieces  of bacon, 2 pancakes and a big slice of ham (bonus points for putting the butter for the pancakes in a little cup and not glopping it onto the cakes themselves). We also shared a french press of coffee which they brought out before the food. Again, everything was great. Coffee, food, everything. And it's all super inexpensive! For the two of us we spent less than $25. You can also get an extra 10% off if you show the hostess that you checked in on Yelp.   I made sure to tip the waitress really well, she deserved it. Overall, you can't ask for better service, better food, and better prices.",

We got a small stack of the grain pancakes, which was actually a pretty big stack.  They were good, but nothing to write home about.  Also got an omlete with cheese, bacon, and avocado.  Minimal avocado, tons of bacon and cheese.  After working out, would have preferred the reverse.  It was tasty though and came with a heaping side of cottage cheese and tomoatos.  Food tasted as expected.  Service was ok.  Not too spot on for a Sunday, which one would think would be the prime breakfast day.  Cost was around $20 for above mentioned food and 2 coffees.  Wish I would've ordered that cinnamon roll in a mug- looks divine!  The crowd must come around 11AM, as there were 4 or 5 parties waiting for a table.",

Crispy bacon, perfect amount of avocado. A healthy portion, I was Almost able to finish it.  My company had the spinach florentine, beautifully poached eggs.  And their coffee cups are BIG.  Made me wonder why all restaurants don't use big cups? Staff here moves fast, tables turn quick and food flies out of the kitchen.  I never had to ask for a refill someone was constantly filling our coffees and waters. Glad we got here early a line started quickly but I can't imagine anyone waited more than 10 minutes.  I was so satisfied with my meal but when I saw a waitress carrying some French toast covered in glazed apples I almost wanted to sit down and eat again!  And then I heard there was a chocolate caramel pot of bread.. So much more I want to try! We will definitely be back again during our stay here. Also, There was a 10% discount for posting on social media! Great place.",

My go to item is the \"Denver potato pancakes\".  They're less like pancakes, and more like shredded hash browns mixed with diced ham, and vegetables, but they are absolutely amazing.  The portions here are huge, too.  You can get two meals out of most of the entrees here.

My all time favorite is the Sandy omlette. Think BLT with avocado wrapped in fluffy eggs, melted cheese and sour cream. You have your choice of bread side- but I would recommend the pot of bread.

So good, I knew that it could easily become a \"go to\" item when decisions had to be made on the fly.  Also, on the side, I order their famous bread in a pot.  If you LOVE fresh bread and carbs as much as I, you'll flip for this warm, doughy goodness!  (sigh)  The second time: I ordered the Jamms breakfast sandwich; scrambled eggs, ham, cheese, Texas toast.............typical flavors for a typical breakfast sandwich.  Yet again, I ordered the bread in the pot and it melted in my mouth!  It is the business!!!  The third time: I was craving good 'ole steak and eggs so I made my way to the closest breakfast joint.  No, I'm lying, I wanted the bread in the pot!!!  =)  I'm a medium-rare, over medium kinda girl, and when the steak came out chewy and well done and the eggs, over-hard, I was terribly disappointed.  The only thing that was eaten that meal were the hash browns (you can't mess up potatoes, can you?) and the POT OF BREAD (of course)!  On my most recent visit to Jamms, I decided to order my \"GO TO\" turkey, swiss and pear wrap........decision well made, THANK GOD!  As usual, I ordered the POT OF BREAD, and LOVED every moment of it! =)  ~The service is wish-y wash-y at best.  One time I'll have over the top exceptional attention, and other times I'll be flagging the server down because I've gone 20 minutes (literally) without any sort of look my way. ~The menu is large........nearly 20 omelets alone! ~The POT OF BREAD is what keeps me coming back!!!  I dream about that bread!  Every time I drive past Jamms (which is often) I think about that bread!  UGH...........I want some NOW just writing about it!!!   =) ~I'll continue to give this place a shot......they can thank the POT OF BREAD for that!  =)",

I wish I could say that I believe Jamms Restaurant is jammin' or had some delicious  and wondrous homemade jam, however I cannot but that is alright just like how the restaurant is alright.  Mostly certainly it was a miscommunication between myself and the name of the restaurant as I thought that perhaps the restaurant would serve some awesome jam, but to my dismay only the pre-packaged Knott's jam is available.. darn.  The menu consist of your typical breakfast items, omelets, sandwiches, corn beef hash, pancakes, but you don't need something extraordinary as long as the ordinary is consistently delicious. Although during my visits I was not particularly impressed by my dishes. Reason being is that I felt that my Jamm's signature omelet which was composed of steak, bearnaise sauce, murshrooms and cheese was somewhat bland and my steak was difficult to chew. I also had a piece of my friend's Jamm's french toast which was battered and covered in corn flakes, my impressions are that I will probably stick with the normal french toast as the specialty is a little mushy for me.   The service was jammin' though, the waitress were friendly, helpful, and refilled my water often. My dining companions went MIA after ordering but the waitress was very understanding and patient with that, always monitoring when my friends would come back to the table. However I would like to mention that the waitress had no clue what I was talking about when I mentioned the Yelp special nor did the cashier, which made things a little embarrassing for myself as I had to explain their special promo to receive my free pot of bread.. the jammin' stopped there unfortunately.  Maybe in the future when I am tired of my usual breakfast places again I will give Jamms another try or perhaps for lunch I could jam with the California Club",

There are 3 people who I see everytime I go that have been there since before we first went there and they always greet me with and extra big smile. I recently took my wife and her parents and our nephew and there was not one complaint about the whole meal. I was suprised that my super picky fatherin law who is also an amazing cook did not say 1 bad thing about the meal and that was a shocker, he always complains. This restaurant is wonderful, the pot of bread is to die for (if it's fresh) and they are aware of the Yelp, free bread deal, and the waitresses are always so very nice. It is definitely 1 of my favorite places to eat in Vegas.",

    "text": "My wife and I ate at Jamms this past weekend for breakfast, and let me tell you, this is somewhere we will be coming back to all the time because it was amazing.  We had one of their pot breads to start (cinnamon raisin), which was awesome and free with yelp checkin! The sweetened butter was fabulous too.  For our mains, I had the breakfast burrito which was a perfectly prepared burrito filled with eggs, onions, and cheese and some delicious hash browns.  It was excellent.  But as good as that was, my wife's Jamms breakfast sandwich was better.  It was easily the best breakfast sandwich I've had.  Ham, cheese, eggs, thick Texas toast.  It was fabulous.  The home fries were delicious as well.  With that said, I also have to comment on the outstanding service provides by the employees at this establishment.  From the moment we came in and the hostess took our name to the end of our meal, service was friendly and outstanding.  We were greated promptly, sat at a perfectly clean table as soon as it was ready (there was a line when we arrived, as the place is deservedly popular), and our drinks (coffee and water) never reached empty.  Orders were taken quickly, food was brought promptly, it was a tour de force of outstanding service. And, to top it all off, this place is a great value.  Prices were extremely reasonable!  Overall I cannot recomment this place enough.  Go here and enjoy.  You will love it!",

Took family here to eat breakfast once and now everytime they visit, we have to go to Jamm's at least once...even their friends came here on a recommendation!    The omelettes are huge and so the the pancakes.  They both taste great also!  They are even able to do egg subsitute upon request!  They offer sides with the main breakfast items and I recommend the \"pot-of-Bread\".  It's soooooo good!  They always have cinnamon raisin and plain...but they also have their \"special\" which ranges from jalapeno chedder to s'mores!  All of it is great!  Price is reasonable, wait is reasonable, wait staff and hostess are always happy and helpful!  Give it a try if you're ever on that side of town!",

    "text": "I love this place!!! I first got to know about this little piece of breakfast heaven from my co-worker. We had breakfast here before heading to the desert to go off-roading.  So let's start with the location.. It's located on Rainbow and Charleston. It's way off the Strip. But it sure is a local favorite. Finding a parking spot close enough is not always easy but it can only mean one thing.. Jamms is packed! They do get really busy and you might have to wait a few minutes to be seated but I'm telling you it is worth your while.  About the service. Nothing but the most jolly and caring people. It's like coming to breakfast at grandma's or your aunt. The servers always have a big smile on their faces and you are always greeted warmly. Nothing can beat that to start your day!  Then there's the food.. Big generous servings. Since I checked-in on Yelp on our 3rd. visit (this morning) we got a FREE pot of bread.. You can choose either plain, cinnamon & raisin, or the special. I chose the special which for today was Peanut Butter & Spice. It was served with what I believe is a cream cheese butter spread. Oh, it's to die for!!!  We also got half a serving of their biscuits & gravy and OMG! It was delicious. I ordered Chicken Fried Steak and Eggs cooked over-medium (that's how I always have my eggs).  It came with hash browns and another pot of bread. This time I asked for it to be plain. And of course it did not disappoint. I finished my whole plate!!! I was so full.  My fiance ordered a Panini Bread with a side of Steak Fries and he said on his first bite, \"Oh my God! This is a great Panini!\" And he doesn't always pay much compliments about sandwiches.. Only the well deserving ones.  All in all, our dining experience at Jamms is great as always! We shall come back again sometime soon.. I strongly recommend them for people looking for a good straight-forward and unpretentious breakfast/brunch for cheap with awesome service.",

    "text": "Now I didn't know what a 'pot of bread' even was before I got here. I don't even know if that's a Jamms specialty or not. It's fantastic. The 'pot of bread' is the type of treat that breakfast places offer that I have a particular fondness for. They have a selection of other breakfast type foods that aren't bread and that don't come in pots (or little aluminum cups).   The corned beef omelette is what I decided on. It was deemed a house favorite and I thought it could be risky. You think corned beef wouldn't be too hard, but I've had my share of salt with a touch of corned beef before. The beef was delicious and this meal all held up pretty well. They do sauerkraut and cheese in the omelette as well as the corned beef. The sauerkraut wasn't wet or overpowering, a nice compliment to the beef. There were hash browns I wish I could tell you more about but I inhaled them. Gone almost as quickly as they arrived. I think you already know my feelings about that soft, supple, raisin 'pot o bread' with the whipped butter that spread like like love on top.  The one touch that really had me was the kindness and the cheer from the staff. Nothing but smiles and friendliness. When we went, it had been raining pretty much all morning. I could hear our waitress tell other tables (and us) when we left to be safe driving out there. You just can't help but smile on that thoughtfulness. Definitely feels like you are eating in your grandma's kitchen and that's an amazing place to be.",

We came here 10 am on a Sunday morning. The wait turned out to not be bad since a lot of people in line before us had given up. Sad for them, awesome for us!  We were promptly seated, brought menus and coffee, and greeted by our enthusiastic server, Sandy (Hi, Sandy!). I told her I was checking in on Yelp and she was thrilled to tell me that I got a free pot of bread.   We ordered: - White Castle omelette - $5 small plate egg white/no cheese omelette - Pot of bread - flavor of the week was strawberries and cream  HOLY POT OF BREAD! These are amazing. It's like angels from heaven came down and manifested themselves into a gooey, fluffy, warm pocket of bread.   $5 egg white omelette was the perfect size! I try to eat a healthy breakfast, but when portions are gigantic, it's impossible. The veggies inside were nicely cooked. It is a great small bite to order.  THEY HAVE SUPER HUMAN BUST BOYS! Twice we watched bust boys catch dropped plates in mid-air. It was really quite impressive.   I had such a great dining experience here, and will be back!!!!",

Just plan even when ordering things like Jamm's French toast which 1/4 piece was enough to know it was a bad choice. Ruben Omelette had no seasoning and had no resemblance to a Rueben sandwich.  So I fail to see the real interest.  Too each his or her own, but would never be compared to home or southern cooking.",

The ladies at the register trying to seat parties and the wait staff yelling when a table was cleared and clean. It was just not a very relaxing environment. If I wanted to hear all that squawking, I would go to my in-laws. I think there are too many other breakfast places around town that have a more warm, welcoming, and relaxing vibe that I look for.",

We were immediately greeted with drinks and told our server would be with us shortly.  Out of nowhere, a lady with short gray hair and glasses says are you ready to order?  My gf answers no but had questions for her about a couple of the meals.  Before she could ask anything the lady was gone.  About a minute later she comes back and says what was it that your were going to ask me?  My gf says what are your recommendations she says then I am walking away and proceeded to walk away.  At this point we're thinking she joking... nope!  She never came back to answer the question but later came back and said did you decide yet?  We again answered no and she walked away again.  Y'all I have never experienced anything like that in my life!  There are far too many food places to choose from to eat!  I refuse to give any business my money that treats their customers like that!  She was very rude and very unprofessional.  We got up and left! Came to the Omellette House and the treatment was night and day and the food was amazing!",

Although it's been a few years since we've been back to Jamms, I do have to say that this place is still as good as I remembered it to be. The service is quick and the staff are super friendly. Our waitress was very attentive and always checked on us frequently. My boyfriend ordered the ham steak & eggs and I ordered the Florentine benedict with a a request to add Canadian bacon to it. Everything came out hot and fast. The food was delicious (especially the pot of bread). In addition, the prices are reasonable and the portions are huge! Btw, remember to check in to get a free pot of bread. I highly recommend this place! We will be back for sure.",

And I definitely came here with an open mind and ready to love this restaurant since it is so close to my office.   Visited on a Saturday morning and it was busy but we didn't have to wait long for a table.  It took a while for our drink order to be taken and then a while longer for our server to take our food order, but it wasn't that big of a deal.    We had the seasonal pumpkin roll, the no-longer-on-the-menu french toast sandwich and the pancakes combo.  Nothing was spectacular or worthy of writing home about.  The only thing I enjoyed there was my coffee, which was better than average.    Our server did not check up on us once except when she took our order and when she gave us our check.  However, we noticed she checked on all the other tables around us.  Again, it's not that big of a deal since we are relatively low maintenance, but it was an interesting observation.    Maybe the other Jamms-goers know something we don't know, but unfortunately I won't be returning to this establishment.",

Otherwise you get a cup of light brown water with a hint of coffee aroma attached. Seriously I could see completely through to the bottom of the cup. The large orange juice was infact quite large.... a small carafe. I had the Jamm's Breakfast Sandwich with Ham. It is thin sliced ham, cheese, and scrambled egg on Texas toast. It comes with a side of hash browns or breakfast potatoes.  This was okay..... not great, not bad. Probably wouldn't order it again. My hubby had the Mattys Country Benedict. Two poached eggs, sausage patty on a biscuit covered with country gravy. He said his was okay.  Again, not bad...... but with so many other options, I can't see us coming back anytime soon.",

It's no wonder why they've won Trip Advisor Best of LV for four years in a row. If you're looking for an affordable brunch in LV, it's a must try.  Coffee - good.   Pot of Bread - lots of hype, but all air - literally. If you must try it, do so. If you don't, you're not missing much.  Breakfast Burrito - delicious especially with all that cheese and potatoes. Lots of going in this burrito, but you won't be disappointed.   Fried Chicken Waffle Sandwich - the star in this dish is the waffle. The fried chicken was crispy as was the waffle. The waffle had a sweet and cajun-like seasoning. Yummy. The tomatoes and lettuce tricked your mind thinking this sandwich was actually healthy. Regardless, it's good.  Corned Beef Hash - Different, but good. It's homemade with ample bits of cured ham. It could have been more \"hashy\", so it worked more like a skillet. The potatoes were good, but wasn't integrated well into the ham. Again, different, but tasted good.  French Toast - tried the the traditional french toast as well as the french toast sticks. This was my favorite dish. The french toast was made with thick toast and battered and fried to a nice crispy outer texture. The inside of the french toast was fluffy and moist. The french toast sticks were fun and easy to eat. Again, crispy outer and moist inner.   Service was courteous and prompt. You get 10% off with Yelp check-in.",

Another element or two of the Reuben would have improved it.  The kids were happy with their meals.  Service was ok.  They were busy so I don't really fault them for that.

    "text": "I don't get it. The only thing that I would order again was the pot of bread, which is essentially a dinner roll in a muffin tin. I tried the cinnamon raisin and the peaches and cream. They were both good, and slightly undercooked, which makes the dough delicious, but it's not worth coming back for. The cinnamon raisin was the normal white bread roll with cinnamon and raisins sprinkled on top after it was done cooking, and the peaches were the same way: white roll with a spoonful of cooked peaches dropped on top after baking. Meh.  The other food we got was mediocre at best and the ingredients were clearly low quality: canned mushrooms andcanned black olives, frozen spinach, what seemed like reheated Arby's meat, and precooked egg patties for the omelets. They were just the spongey egg patties like you might get at subway (except larger) and then some low quality ingredients warmed up and placed inside like an egg taco. Service was okay but I felt like they waited a long time to bring the check, which we felt guilty about because there were people waiting for tables. Everyone was friendly, and it was bustling, but I don't understand why it's so highly rated. Wouldn't go back.   Update: since the owner of the restaurant responded with saying that the ingredients are fresh and there are a whopping six eggs in each omelet, I just feel like it's worth stating that there's no chance in hell thats True. So I don't know if this was actually the owner, and he has no idea what's happening in his kitchen, or if that was written by someone hired to pretend to be the owner and respond to negative reviews... but either way, I'm not an idiot and I know when I'm looking at canned mushrooms and canned olives. I've made a quickie pizza a time or two. Also, yesterday I made 5 eggs scrambled for my son and I. Again, I'm not an idiot and I have some frame of reference to understand what a certain count of eggs looks like in a skillet. There's absolutely no possibility that six eggs were used in my omelette. I think it would've been a lot better on the part of the restaurant to own up to the cheap ingredients instead of lie to defend their kitchen. Dropping this review to 2 stars from 3.",

Oh and $2 additional to add a couple of slices of banana to oatmeal?  Won't be back, terrible.",

It did take a little while for us to get our orders in, but they were slammed on a rainy Friday morning/afternoon.   We started off with French toast sticks, and then I had the Florentine eggs Benedict. The spinach tasted frozen and had the freezer after taste to it, so that kind of turned me off a little. My cousin seemed to like her pancakes and eggs breakfast.   After we were finished, the waitress forgot to drop our check so we awkwardly sat there trying to get her attention until we finally went up to the cashier, and let her know we didn't have a check. I kind of drove out of the way because I was craving a gluttonous breakfast, but I think I'd stick to my Blueberry Hill staple next time I want pancakes and coffee.",

    "text": "My second visit to Jamms and I might be hooked! As an east coast girl, I grew up on diner breakfast and have been scouring the country for that homestyle familiarity. The LAST place on earth I thought I'd find it is Vegas.   Bringing my visiting PA native parents here at an off peak time (very important to avoid a long wait at this popular spot) we were seated immediately by friendly staff. Our waitress came over promptly and took our drink order. Consummate coffee drinkers, my family complimented Jamms regular brew. I've had their French press prior, and that was just as delicious.   Mom and Pop took forever to decide but two words on the menu immediately decided for me: taylor ham. This Jersey breakfast staple is impossible to find outside of the Mid-Atlantic!! The Taylor Ham breakfast sandwich with (gasp!) REAL griddled potatoes was my choice. One bite and I was transported back to college and better days. Listen, I'm not an asshole that waxes poetic about food for no reason, but I'm not kidding--the sandwich was bomb.   Mom got the 2 egg breakfast with bacon and hashbrowns because she's boring and a picky eater. It was as good as it gets with eggs over medium cooked perfectly. Dad got Joes omelet which was big enough to make him think twice about finishing the whole thing (he did though, because he is a machine).   The pot o bread--a fluffy roll baked in a muffin tin--was phenomenal. Do yourself a favor and get the flavored ones. Cinnamon raisin is a delicious choice!!  Our food was served almost immediately after ordering, and server Jasmine was perfectly attentive without being overbearing--a hard balance to master. This place is popular for a reason so be prepared to wait but trust me, it's worth it.",

He liked the crunchiness. Coffee was good. I ordered the chicken waffle BLT which includes the very fresh tomato and lettuce. I liked the concept. The chicken was ok; the waffle was better. Bacon was ok. Our server, Jasmine, was very helpful and attentive. I am giving this cafe four stars for Jasmine and the atmosphere of very hard working employees and clean, old school decor.

Service: 5/5 Our servers were polite and helpful when it came to selecting drinks and foods from the menu.  The food came out very quickly even though the restaurant was at full capacity, and the coffee was also given to us nice and hot.  We received a free pot of bread for checking in on Yelp!  Food: 4/5 Our main dishes were on our table less than 10 mins after we ordered it.  Somewhere before it came, we received our pots of bread.  I've had better, but it wasn't too bad.  It was just tad heavier and drier than what I personally prefer.  The food was decent.  I'd say its a tier above a typical Denny's or IHOP for sure.  Location: 4/5 The atmosphere of the place has an early 80's late 70's breakfast diner sort of feel to it.  Very warm with some character.  It pairs nicely with their breakfast selection, and I could see this place being a regular breakfast joint for people to go to and start their mornings in.  Overall: 4/5",

We were at Treasure Island And a Guest recommended this place as the best breakfast in the area. The service is outstanding the Pot Of Bread we liked , but that was about it, I had the Chicken and Waffles, I wanted to be blown away, left half on the plate, Wish the Chicken was homemade. The French Toast Fries are a great a idea and not bad,My wife enjoyed the Hollandaise sauce on her benedict , My daughter  did not finish her Reuben Sandwich, Overall Jamms is a fun place with Great Service, I will ask some friends that live in the area to check it out, just in case we got them in a bad day",

My father and I weren't looking for the whole sit down and be served experience, just the biscuits and gravy which we would have gladly taken to go if it had even been an option but the woman at the counter quickly snapped that they were closed/done for the day.   Fortunately there was a knowledgeable patron just outside that noticed I was pregnant, even he was a little surprised they wouldn't allow us to order anything, not even to go. He suggested we try Hash House A Go-Go, that's where my father and I are right now and the baby and I got our biscuits and gravy so we're happy again.",

Was looking forward to trying one of their pots of bread that we read so much about.  We came at a good time because we had no wait at all.  The restaurant was about half full.  Our server was terrific, friendly, attentive, and fast.    There are many choices on the menu.  We were getting confused because everything sounded so good.  I finally decided on Jamm's French Toast.  My wife ordered an omelet.  So, what did I think of the food?  Overall, it was okay.  Maybe, we did not order the best food off the menu.  Would I come here again?  Probably not.  There are so many breakfast places yet for us to try in Las Vegas.",

I had the eggs Benedict, which was perfect, and my girlfriend had the steak and eggs. We split a strawberries  and cream pot of bread which is really a must if you go here.

So on the rare occasion that I AM up early for breakfast, I kind of like to reward myself for it. And as I was driving from my bank, I see this little restaurant in the plaza, and it's been rated Best of the LVR-J for 4 years, and it's only open until 3. Well I have to try it, I thought.  Best discovery on the Westside in a long time. The atmosphere is cozy, like your mom's kitchen (if she had an industrial kitchen). Knick-knacks and country sayings adorn the walls, and the staff treats you like you're in their house. Try the Texas Omelette (with chili con carne and cheddar cheese) or if you're daring, the White Castle Omelette (with ground beef and grilled onions -- yes, like a Slider!). They're famous for their \"pots of bread.\" It's soft and doughy, and if you order the Cinnamon Raisin pot of bread, it's like eating a cinnamon roll.  They also have lunch items, which I'm sure I'll try someday, when I can get past the breakfast pages without choosing something.",

JR is always a front runner in any Friday \"where are we going to breakfast\" discussion.  The reasons being you are always going to get a great breakfast, happy service and great coffee.  The omelets are a group favorite and I seem to focus on the Jamms Signature Omelet.   It consists of pieces of sliced tender steak, onions, mushrooms, cheese.  All covered with a wonderful bearnaise sauce.  JR is known for their pots of bread, which is FREE when you check-in on yelp.  The benefit  has yet to expire because every time I check-in.....there it is.  CHECK-IN!  ON my most recent visit some ordered the grits.  Now I can take or leave grits.  But I would kiss these grits all damn day until I died of a heart attack.  Heart attack?  YES!  the are covered in cheese and comes with butter! You can get the LARGE or you can get a \"monkey size\" which dials down you cholesterol a tad.  Be sure to grab a stick of Juicy Fruit at the counter when you settle up the bill.

Checked in and received my free pot of bread. Pretty cool. I love free items. The cream cheese frosting isn't too sweet and I tried the new chocolate chip cinnamon raisin bread.  We all were starving so I only got a few pictures in. I will talk about the food I did try.  The Belgium waffle is large and tasty. Actually, all the plates are huge, so come with a huge appetite, or expect to take food home. Apple cinnamon French toast is ridiculously big and sweet. Too sweet for my liking but it might just hit the spot for those of you with a huge sweet tooth. Large enough for two or three people to share. I got the biscuits and gravy, which were delicious. I practically had to lick the plate clean. If it weren't for the biscuits and gravy this probably would have been a. Three star review.   Everyone else loved their items, but I didn't get to try them. Next time, I say!  Waitress was great at constantly topping off our coffee and bringing more creamer too. Considering how busy they were I would have never known considering how often she visited out able. Great!

I'd expect when you go over $10 that your portions would be a bit bigger for being off-strip.  It's pretty pricey here for being so far from the strip.

The small plate omelet is about half the size of a regular omelet and also half the price.   We also got their famous \"pot of bread\" (got a free one for checking in on Yelp!). The weekly special was jalapeno mozzarella and the classic cinnamon raisin. Both were super yummy!

Their food is good and comforting. But what made the visit great was Victor and his hard work.  I watched him take care of other parties with the same passion and care & you can tell her truly loves his job here.  Great asset to the establishment, our food server was also great and courteous.

I mixed the seasoned salt and mild Tabasco together (both on the tables) and had the saltiest, corned beefiest, hashiest breakfast ever. So good, and so unassuming of a menu item. The omelettes get much more play.  My bf ordered an omelette, and I thought the steak was pretty dry (losing a star), but it had a ton of cheddar on it. The hash browns are definitely made in-house and are delicious - I recommend pairing them with the hash. :-)   Very cozy atmosphere that gets busy, but is an excellent spot for families. I also like that they give out free gum at the counter. I saw a lot of grandmas today, and they all looked pretty stoked.   Free \"Pot of Bread\" with check-in. Give em' a try!",

    "text": "My husband and I decided to try this out since it's down the street from where we live, we went in there around 11:00 am and the place was pretty packed already. We didn't wait too long so that was cool was a good thing.  Once we had sat down, someone had come over to take our drinks right away. And if you're a big coffee person, this place is for you. They make sure that your coffee is never low or out during your whole dining experience.  My Husband ordered the Corn Beef Hash with a side of toast, which tasted really good. It wasn't too salty like most placed that we have tried. And the hash browns were a good sized portion and very crispy.  I had ordered the Country Fried Steak with the famous Pot Bread on the side, and the Steak was good, but the gravy tasted like packaged gravy to me. It was also a little bland and it's sad to say I had add a little salt and pepper on top to add some flavor. But everything else was delicious. My Hash Brown were just as crispy and delicious as the one my husband had. Oh and the pot bread... I've never tried anything like that before and it was super tasty, I got the cinnamon raisin pot bread and OH MY GOODNESS, DELICIOUS. it came out warm and it wasn't too sweet even when I added the icing on top. Yum.  Overall I had a good dining experience here at Jamms except when My husband and I received our food it wasn't as hot as I expected to be. I felt that they were so slammed that they might have forgotten about our food because the table besides us got sat 15-20 minutes after we did and got their food the same time. But we will be back though, because everyone was so sweet and we love Mom and Pop Shops",

    "text": "***Local Vegas Breakfast Spot***  #LocalFlavor  There is a basket of Juicy Fruit and Big Red Stick gums at the hostess counter to sweeten up your taste buds before or after breakfast because guess what? I did pick up a stick or two to chew on while waiting about 20 minutes before and another stick after an awesome meal.  I've ordered their Irish Skillet which consist of corn beef hash, bell peppers, onions, potatoes scrambled with eggs and melted cheddar cheese, it didn't disappoint! I know a good skillet meal when I try one when it all just melts in my mouth, but hey the potatoes on these were not dry but almost light as butter, the scramble mesh well the all the toppings that made it a hearty meal for me.   Addition to the experience my wife's Ruben Benedict was delicious! English muffin topped with corned beef, two poached eggs covered with hollandaise sauce? whats in that sauce?! it was creamy and it added some flavor, the corned beef was sizzlin'! and I love corned beef!  No coffee this time! but I've ordered the specialty Mexican Cinnamon Hot Chocolate/no whip cream which was good it's almost a horchata, just not as sweet. On the side, I recommend giving their Bacon Ranch Pot of Bread a try! It's a small bread with bacon bits pouched inside with butter spread, very tasty along with the softness core to bite in.  The ambience inside is like one of those old school diners with spacious booth seating and of course awesome service. Our server reminds me of some lady in the Simpsons because she had that friendly lovely voice.  I highly recommend this spot to do away classy Vegas eats for breakfast time.",

This is my 5th visit here and it was so awful that I do NOT want to ever return! First off we saw our food sitting in the window for a long time and of course it was COLD! My friend didn't even eat her entree and when the awful waitress picked up a full plate of food she didn't even ask if there was anything wrong! We ended up paying that entire bill and because my friends are waitresses they believe in karma and still left that lazy no good waitress a $5 tip!  Our Irish skillet was so awful I only ate a few bites. The pot o bread was doughy and not fully baked! Even the hot water to the hot tea was warm! Really?!?!?!  AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL!!!!!!!!!!!!  Never again!!!!!!",

Blends in well, I've lived in vegas my whole life and just discovered this place recently.   My girlfriend and I have only gone for breakfast a handful of times, and each time we were impressed with the price and quality of food. I got the bumper omlette; fluffy eggs, mushrooms, broccoli, cream cheese, and topped with hollandaise sauce. I added bacon to it. AMAZING!! The service was pretty good, especially considering how busy it was. My girlfriend had a pretty customized order, and they had no problem with it.   I would recommend Jamm's to anyone who likes breakfast food, and is tired of Dennys and ihop. Be sure to go early though, as they are only open for breakfast and lunch and close at 2pm!  P.S. You have not lived until you get a \"pot of bread\" from these guys!!!",

They try to wait until your entire party is there before they sit you which is annoying if you are trying to save a seat but wonderful if you are a party of two trying to get in.  The food is home cooked and genuine and the Pot of bread is an added bonus.  I had the sausage and egg breakfast with home fries.  The eggs were over easy perfection and the home fries were seared with a crispy lightness that was satisfying.  Today the special pot of bread was creamy peach served with sweet cream cheese frosting on the side.  If this were close to my home I would come here a lot more often.  MMMMM!",

They even offered a to go cup for what we didn't drink. The corn beef hash is hands down the BEST EVER!!!!!! It was what my husband had, along with the carmelized onion, bacon, cream cheese pot of bread. Dayyyyum!!! My next trip I'll be trying the S'mores pancakes. Sounds like a little piece of heaven.  The servers were on point with everything!! Check it out!",

Plus you have to expect some of that for such a popular restaurant.    We were seated in a comfortable booth and approached immediately by staff for our drink order.  The coffee was so-so but good.  I ordered Jamm's Signature Omelet and it was very tasty.  Totally forgot to get a pic of it as it looked just like the pic in the menu.  Medium to large omelet and very good tasting.  I also ordered the Pot of Bread and it was very good.  Prices were comparable to IHOP and Denny's but the quality and flavor was way better.",

    "text": "My brother and I were both up at 8am and wanted some breakfast.  He found this place online and wanted to try it due to some awards they received from Best of Vegas.  I then looked it up on here and read about the special offer for a free pot of bread.  I love bread and was excited to find out what it was exactly and to try it.  After our waitress took our orders I mentioned Yelp and asked about the pot of bread.  She didn't seem familiar with the offer, but didn't question it at all and brought me one.  In case you're wondering, it's a personal sized piece of bread that comes in a little round bowl and resembles a large cupcake.  I got the cinnamon-raisin one and it was definitely the best part of my dining experience.  The top was just a little toasted and the middle was soft and chewy.  If that were all I ate I'd have given them 5 stars, but sadly it went downhill from there.     I ordered an omelet with avocado, bacon, and cheddar and it was a big disappointment.  There was quite a bit of bacon inside, but it was all way overcooked and a little thick, so it was rock hard.  The avocado was good but it was all on one side, so I had to open it up and spread it out.  Also, the only cheddar I found was a few shredded pieces on top.  Like I said, very disappointing.  In hindsight I should have sent it back and either gotten something else or had them remake it. They give a choice of hash browns or home fries and I had the latter.  They were good and had bits of onion and bell pepper mixed in.  Overall, I can see how this place could be good, but my experience wasn't the best.  I'd give 'em a mulligan tho.",

We called ahead to make reservations since we had quite a few people and were told the wait was 15 minutes. We got there and the wait was 20 minutes, but we waited over 30 minutes before we went in and asked for an update. There was a large empty booth that we requested, but they said they would not allow us to use it since they didn't think we would fit. They didn't even let us try, and the majority of our party was small children, so we would have fit. They then told us the only way to let us eat was to put us at two tables at opposite sides of the restaurant. It was very frustrating. By that time we had been there about 40 minutes and everyone was getting very hangry. We ended up having to just go somewhere else. We wish they would have just told us they didn't have room for that many people when we originally called so we didn't waste our time. None of us will be going back after the horrible service we received.",

The omeletes are decent, but I prefer the kind where the ingredients are cooked into the eggs, rather than just piled in and folded over.  NO big deal though.

Not long ago, I was yearnin' for somethin' different than my regular rotation and decided to check out this place. There was a steady stream of people heading in at 9am, which is a smidge earlier than a typical rush - a good sign. The decor is... well.... Bridges of Madison County meets sponge paint meets truck stop.  Once you get over the momentary shock of that, you know you're at a place that feels like home. The menu has a lengthy omelette menu which includes the likes of a White Castle omelette. Being from Chicago, I was filled with warm fuzzies.  I settled on the house special omelette, which was steak, onions, sauteed mushrooms and provolone cheese.  The omelettes are done just like I happen to like them, with thin egg wrapped around sauteed yummies in the middle.  The bread in a pot was a nifty surprise as well.  Home baked white bread in a little white ramikin served with softened butter.   All in all, it was a hit. Go to Jamm's and find yourself in breakfast heaven.",
