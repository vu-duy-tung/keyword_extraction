In general, prices were extremely inflated, and portion sizes did not live up to any of our expectations. There was absolutely no table service at all, and the workers still insisted on adding a 10% service charge to our bill. All plates and utensils they provided were plastic because their so called \"health inspectors\", prohibited them from using regular silverware. If you wanted water, you had to pay for it separately by buying an overpriced 2 dollar water bottle. The only positive side to the food was the Naan (bread), simply because it was made fresh. The Rest of the food was average compared to other Pakistani/Indian restaurants I have ate at in the past...",

If you like hot food this is the place in Vegas. Would recommend this place to anyone and I will be back. I only wish this that the owner would consider doing a ones a week buffet to experience the dishes. Overall I give them 5 stars. Keep on cooking :)",

    "text": "We were just in Vegas on vacation, and eight of us went to Kabab and more for a late lunch. I admit I was a little hesitant and it didn't look to be in the greatest section of town, down on the strip Toward Circus Circus.  I was very pleasantly surprised to see the menu, literally something for everyone which was difficult with our party. They were for children ranging in age from 5 to 13, and for adults. The menu accommodated everyone with two of the kids getting standard American fare of a hamburger the other one got chicken fingers and french fries. Both of those meals were excellent by the way not cheap frozen nuggets, and the burger was made very nicely with condiments as well as lettuce and tomato, it was very juicy and my son loved it. I was so happy to see Indian food that I love, I got the paneer tikka  masala, along with a side of yogurt and garlic Nan bread. It was very good, not too spicy but plenty of flavor. Or friends each got Biryani rice dishes. My husband got a gyro, he loved it. It's a small place, you go in order your food, pay for it and then sit in the dining room and they will bring it to you when it's ready. The staff was excellent and very accommodating and patient with us and all of our questions. With all the options of places to eat in Vegas I would definitely make another trip to this restaurant because it was delicious, affordable and the choices were many. They also had everything from pizza, to Middle Eastern and Indian foods. I really wish them the best of luck and success with their business because we were very happy and I hope everybody in Vegas has a chance to stop there.",

I wish I could give it zero.  It took almost an hr to get the food and although they say it's made fresh, it was definitely not worth the hr wait. The cashier guy even tried to rip us off by adding extra charges for items that are advertised on their menu to come with the dish. when confronted he just quickly gave us $1 (suppose to be $1.49) to shut us up and had the audacity to expect a tip. Very poor customer service and food was below average and highly overpriced.  The rant could continue, but I'll leave it with this warning: the taco place next door is amazing, and even though the line is intimidating GO THERE. AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS",

Now we wish we have just stayed in the long line at Tacos el Gordo:  Cashier: \"What would you like to order?\"  Us: \"Two chicken wraps; one with rice and the other with fries.\"   Cashier: \"Ok..fries? And the other with rice? Us: Yes Cashier: \"and to drink?\" Us: \"A cup of water and a sprite\"  We sat down and waited 15 mins for our food. Only ONE chicken wrap and rice came to the table. My boyfriend asked the server if another wrap was on its way. The server stared at us as if he didn't understand English. He didn't say a word. Just stared. So I asked, \"We ordered two chicken wraps, one with a side of rice and the other with fries. Is the other wrap w/fries coming?\" Again the server stared, then decided to looked at our receipt and squeaked: \"One\" and quickly walked off. We were confused if that meant the cashier accidentally charged us just for one wrap. The bill as $19 something and didn't seem like one chicken wrap w/rice and a sprite (and tap water) would cost so much. But it's Vegas, so we wanted to make sure that was the case. So we went to the cashier:  Boyfriend: \"Hi, I just ordered two chicken wraps and a sprite from you. One with rice and the other with fries. Only one wrap came, is the other coming out soon? Or did you forget to charge us?\"  Cashier: Mumbles incoherently (we didn't understand what he said so we asked again)    This was when the manger/owner (?) came out yelling defensively from the back:   Manger: \"ONE! ONE WRAP!\" Boyfriend: \"Hi, I ordered two-\" Manager: \"YOU WANT ANOTHER WRAP? GET IN LINE!\" (The cashier went hiding because he knew he messed up our order but was too scared to tell his boss) Boyfriend: \"Look I was just asking- (gets cut off again) Manager: \"Sir you want another wrap? There is the line. You buy one and I make you a wrap\" *said condescendingly  Boyfriend: \"Fuck this. I don't need to take this from you\" Looks at me: \"lets go.\" Manager: \"No sir eat your food and I'll make you a wrap.\" *again said condescendingly and tries to stop from leaving and direct us back to our table.   We moves away from him and I told him to fuck off. We walked out without eating. I would suggest never eating here. There are better places in Las Vegas than to waste your money on overpriced food and be treated like a dog because you asked a question about your order.",

We ordered chicken & beef boti and chicken & beef kabob which were number 7&8 in their menu, both were served with rice, salad and green sauce. Although one plater would have been enough for us as their helpings are quite big! Food was good and we enjoyed it a lot. We will stop by there tomorrow for lunch again and try something else.

We were told to sit anywhere so we picked one corner of the restaurant to sit at. Not even 3 minutes into us sitting we get a wait staff come to us and tell us to move. They said they got a big party coming so they were going to move the tables together. Though I was not happy we got up and were moved to a table the staff told us to sit at. THEN.... 5 mins into us sitting there. They make us move AGAIN! And tell us to sit on the opposite side because they needed more room. My husband was really mad and was about to leave but we couldn't because we had already paid for our food and it was about to come. Little did we know this exact situation happened to an African American group of ppl. We got moved 3 times they unfortunately got moved 5 times and with that the staff was laughing at them.  Our food came in. It was okay. We ate and left. This second round comes in. I wasn't eager to go but we were passing by and saw this restaurant was completely empty. So we thought we would give it a shot. Little did we know again we would come across the same situation  This time we had a big party of ppl with us. The wait staff tells us to pick a seat and sit there. We go pick the big table they have. We get comfortable and sit.  He then comes back and says you can't sit here, and makes us get up and moves us to a much smaller table. He quoted by saying \"this is a reserved table.\"  I didn't see any reserved sign on the table plus he told us to pick anywhere to sit.  Once that was done we go and sit where he told us to sit and ordered our food. Our food comes, that table gets a reserved sign on it AND GUESS WHO WE SEE SITTING AND EATING AT THAT TABLE?  A gentleman came in alone and was sitting on a \"14 person table\" mind you we were 8.  Never again am I making this mistake again. The food this time around was terrible. We didn't eat any of it. It was all left there. Rubber chicken. Looked like it was microwaved 10 times. The naan was thick and uncooked all the way.  Just a terrible experience and waste of $100. Hold your money and go elsewhere.",

When we showed up, the line was around the building. It was super hot outside and we didn't think any tacos were worth waiting that long for. I was so glad we decided to try another place because I've heard the tacos are overpriced and over hyped anyway. We saw Kabob N More next door and decided to check it out. We were all very glad we came here. I had the vegetarian curry and let me tell you, it was the best I've ever had. Everyone was very satisfied with their meals. My BF couldn't stop eating my food and still raves about the gyro he had. In fact, he's suggested going to Vegas just so he can eat here again. The food did take a while to come out, but it was worth it to us. Also, very affordable prices. We noticed a lot of people starting coming in after we did. They had probably come for tacos and also decided the line was too long. I know that next time we're in town, we're going to be making multiple trips here.",

I had the chicken karai and usually it was a good helping of food now it's a smaller portion and costs more then before! Plus it used to be that the dish had whole pieces of bone in chicken. Which was awesome, now it seems they used scraps of what was ever left over! The dish tasted the same but not nearly worth the price! Plus the place was not very clean, tables were not wiped down and this is when it opened! Sorry to say I won't be back!",

He then started arguing and getting upset and then started screaming uncontrollably saying we have no respect and this is his restaurant.  I told him to stop screaming and he just got more angry and demanded we leave.  The entire thing was rude and beyond disrespectful.

No one like their food. I would never come back here again and hope I  can save someone  from a horrible experience. Go somewhere else!",

It was so salty and just super dry from inside. Rice were under cooked no salad or water was offered. Now the chicken wrap was also gross. Chicken was same chicken used as the chili chicken but without the sauce. It was so dry. Wrap had no sauce on it. I asked for water and server says \"we only had bottle water\" they want to charge for every little thing and rip you off. After this I decided to have chai which was super cold and just not good. This place is way over priced for it's trash food. I do not recommend this to anyone. Please do not waste your money. If you eat halal just go have a pizza instead or something. This is not Pakistani food.",

    "text": "Kabob N More is a casual restaurant that serves fresh, made to order Indian and Pakastani food for reasonable prices (meals starting at $6.99). The meat is halal for those that have dietary restrictions.  One of the owners told me the restaurant has only been open 4mos.  I ordered a very tasty Chana ki Daal, which is a vegetarian curry stew made with garbanzo-like beans.  I ordered it with rice and naan and it also came with a small salad and raita (yogurt sauce).  The serving was huge and could've fed two people.  The salad didn't have much dressing or lemon juice so I just added the raita to it and that did the trick.  Overall, I was really happy to have found this place.  I was also happy to see they had a sink in the eating area to wash your hands.  It must seem weird to some but I often hate having to go to a dirty restroom to wash my hands, especially for food that is usually eaten with your hands.  And, just to be complete, here are a couple of downsides of this place: 1) there was a TV or stereo in each room that was playing it's own music, so that was a bit distracting 2) the interior looked a bit plain and unfinished in the decor but the place is still new so I imagine this is only temporary 3) the food is served on styrofoam, it would be nice if they used something more earth-friendly",

His resteraunt is an \"away from the casino\" option in a lower end strip mall. A Walgreen's sells his $4 bottle water claim for a buck and a small shop further down for 2 for $1. I get better food for less and with rice nicer areas and places back home with I'm pretty sure higher overhead. The food was actually decent but with all the add on hits and bad service you can do better. I obviously won't be going back.

I ordered chicken tikka kabab that comes with rice and a small salad, and my cousin ordered beef shawarma.  Both were really flavorful and crazy spicy.  They give you a side of yummy cilantro cream sauce that you can pour over the rice and meat.  I would eat here again.  If you write a review, you get a free tea.  ;)",

    "text": "I was in vegas for a 7 day trip in which i decided to try this place 3 times.  Yup 3 times.  One my first visit,  there was an old man probably the owner there,  and on all other 3 visits, there was this young guy in his 30s. I asked these guys when i got there what special they were having there that day and what would they recommend.   First visit on 9/2: I was told to try the Nihari. I placed the with couple of naan and a soda. I was charged $22. The food took 15+ mins to arrive and it was ok. It tasted alright but was definitely not worth the price.  Second visit 9/3: I saw this guy in his 20s acting instead of the older man that day and he was very goofy. I asked him what he recommends and he said pick anything from the menu, it's all good. I ended up ordering chicken kabob and waited 15 mins. I kid you not,  when the order came,  it had nothing but boiled rice and one tried up kabob looking thing in it with some lettuce on the side.  I asked him right away if he had my order right because it looked nothing like the pic they had on the menu or just chicken kabob in general.  He assured me out was my order. I tasted the food and it had no taste. I ate 10% of the food and ended up having a dinner at a nearby indian restaurant.  Third visit 9/4: I thought I had bad experience last night possibly due to understaff or whatever reason.  I still have them 3rd try.  I was recommended to try Haleem by this goofy guy. It took a while,  may be 10-15 mins to come. I was surprised that the order came with chicken soup included. He said he would bring the haleem. After waiting a couple of mins,  this guy tells me that was my order. I come from a very authentic desi cooking background and trust me if i say it was a chicken soup, it really was a chicken soup.  It was yellow, very liquidy in texture and with chicken chunks just floating on top. I asked the guy to get me some other dish. While waiting on it,  I asked the waiter/cashier why that haleem looked like soup. His actual response \"Haha bro, that's what you get for ordering something that's on today's special\". That guy actually laughed at me.  I got offended and asked why he was laughing and he said that they are not an actual restaurant but instead a tourist version of a real one.  He said generally people don't come twice as it is tourist town and he doesn't care.  I tried notice the customers there and majority of them were taxi drivers and folks working as security in nearby buildings. I would so NOT recommend this place. It was a great disappointment for me to pick this place. I really took time to write this review because I use yelp a lot and 3 star rating on this one really needs an update to one star.  Overpriced food for no quality whatsoever.",

I guess its expensive because it is halal, but that does not mean anything to me. I can't give more than 2 stars because it is not a great value; the service is just OK, my order came out wrong the first time around so I was annoyed because I was hungry and it took over 15 mins.; AND the food is too spicy. I love spicy food. I know I can take a lot of heat, and know enough about Scoville units. This place, while the food is flavorful with exotic tastes and spices, makes their food too spicy to be beyond what normal people expect. I can give 3 stars but that would mean I am saying it is good and just right. The food is good and flavorful, BUT too spicy, so in good conscience I cannot give it a 3 star rating and then people will think it's great then get their tongues burned.

    "text": "Well, after my last visit, it was many months before making my way back to Vegas. In that time I waxed poetic about the Lamb Biriyani, telling several people about this authentic Halal Indo-Pak restaurant. Unfortunately, on my last visit, I experienced some of what other reviewers have shared. The owner/manager can be quite overbearing and condescending. I ordered my lamb biryani to go and waited longer than before. I was informed by the manager that they were out of lamb, after being told just minutes before by the cashier that my lamb was almost ready. The owner offered me a choice of chicken or mutton instead of lamb. Though disappointed, I chose the chicken biryani because I had it before and it is a close second. Not two minutes later, the manager said they had already prepared for me the mutton biryani. What? When I asked about the mixup, he kept saying that lamb and mutton are the \"Same thing.\" Not exactly. Texture is completely different. Like veal and beef. Same thing, right? To add insult, when the owner handed me my bag, I took it by the handles at the top. The owner, now insulted, immediately and forcefully grabbed my arms to cradle the bag from the bottom, as if I were being scolded, looked me dead in the eye and said in a firm tone \"RESPECT,\" as if carrying my sack of food by the handles was an insult. I was in shock and just left in complete disbelief. The mutton was decent, though chewy compared to the lamb, of course. It was just unreal. Not sure if I will give it another chance or not. So disappointed. That lamb was amazing. :-(",

I was still keen on trying after a long walk from the convention center even though I was in mood to eat Persian Kebabs. I was super hungry so ordered the chicken and beef combo kebabs which was for $16.99 which eventually came out to be $21.15 after taxes and 15% tip. It's Vegas so I shouldn't be crying for it and won't mind shelling extra if the food is good. I've tasted far better Indian/Pakistani food in Vegas. Food - Horrible Service - 20 mins even though there was just 1 customer before me. Water - I asked for a water cup and the answer was, we only keep bottles which are for sale. I should have gone to the Taco place which had a long line or the other Indian restaurants in the same complex.",

The mutton and basmati rice were extremely dry. The mutton was tasteless. The palak paneer was without a doubt the worst. It was nothing more than puree spinach.

    "text": "We ate several times during our recent visit to Las Vegas at this restaurant.The food was very tasty and freshly prepared smelled and looked very good. We tried chicken Biryani , chicken karahi, kebabs, nihari etc.All were well presented and delicious. We have eaten at most of the good restaurants in major cities and will place Kabob n more in top 1%. Service was fast and courteous any thing requested such as extra raita, salad was provided right away with a smile. Nikki at the counter is absolutely delightful and anxious to make you feel comfortable. I also met Mr.Faheem Akhtar the owner , he is a wonderful person and if you ask him he will happily recite great poetry for you. Prices were very reasonable and quantity was extra generous , most dishes can feed two persons . Decor was OK for a desi restaurant, little dark for us but it was clean and well kept. Bath room was  also clean and large . Definitely a place we will return on our next visit. *****",

    "text": "If I could give this place a zero star, it would still not be enough to describe my experience at this place. Only reason we decided to try this place was because my mom only eats Halal and likes her Pakistani food. And there's a serious lack of Pakistani food around the LV strip. So despite food being terrible, we went there a couple of times since it was across our hotel. In our experience at the restaurant, the only thing that was decent and worth ordering were the naans. The chicken boti dish was worth 12 something dollars for 5 pieces of chicken and plain white rice and was semi decent. The chicken karahi was immensely salty, and chicken tandoori was dry, old, reheated, and tasteless. They always claim to have recently ran out or their items on the menu, so the choices are limited to begin with.   On our last visit to the restaurant, we placed an order and sat down to eat, we waited for 25 or so minutes only to be reminded by the girl working there that we need to place an order in the front before sitting down. We were famished and now furious to find out that they owner/ manager never took down our order and simply forgot because 'he is busy doing other work'. He was extremely rude, disrespectful to my bf and mom, extremely argumentative for an individual in a service industry, and outright outrageous. He simply kicked us out of the restaurant because while he claimed 'customers are always right', it wasn't his fault. What a nightmare!   On top of that, place is extremely dirty and not a pleasant place to sit and eat at.   On the up side, due to the owner's despicable behavior we happened to come across Urban Turban in the same neighborhood. They had impeccable sevice, delicious food, qaint and clean ambiance. I would recommend anyone looking for a delicious desi meal to spend an extra few dollars and try this place. We were all IMPRESSED!",

I went in here at 10:30am Las Vegas time, coming from the DMV (DC,MD,VA) area and its lunch time from where I am coming from and I choose to walk in here because I did not feel like eating Tacos. Worse decision made. I was tempted by the \"GYO\" sign and thought this was ran by Greek people but apparently its a Pakistani restaurant.   I was the first to order my meal. I ordered the GYRO and Fries meal listed for $9.99 without tax and my girl friends ordered after me. They got a basmati rice meal. We sit down in a booth section they have and the lady hands my friends their food first and I am still waiting on my sandwich. They took SO long to deliver my food and the GYRO had burnt sections. So disappointing. The lady came out and told me she would give me a complimentary soda for the inconvenience. I'm over here thinking? A soda is not going to fix the HARD fries and burnt flat bread I am eating. She said she will bring out more fries which she did and they were BETTER. But the sandwich was not good. It was a WASTE of money coming here. I should have went to the Taco place that sold BOMB tacos for $2.25 a piece! I had one because my friend went there and it was AMAZING! I hate giving bad reviews but its nothing but the truth.  Update: She did reach out to me after this review to make it better by giving me a redo meal. Too bad I live in Maryland. Otherwise I would have took her up on that offer. Appreciate it!",

I got the chicken tiki Marsala and regular naan. One order of naan was huge. The chicken tiki Marsala was flavorful and has lots of very tender chicken breast pieces. Although the dish doesn't come with rice, the man at the front brought over a complementary bowl of basmati rice. I had enough leftover for a meal the next day.   Service was good, food came out fast, the dining area is a bit dark but nice and cool. Would recommend to others.",

    "text": "Few things are more disappointing than arriving home with your takeout, only to realize the most expensive item you bought isn't in the bag. Let's call this place Kabob N Less.   I wish I had read the reviews before and looked at the spread; it's an inverted bell curve, and that should tell you everything you need to know. Who writes all those inflated 5-stars?   So, you go in, you chat it up about dal and naan and chicken tikka, pay $18, leave a nice tip, and realize once home that you have:  - a fine garlic naan - 4 or 5 CUPS of rice. Who eats this much rice?  - a container of dal  But, no chicken kabob. $18 essentially for RICE, and some lentils. I shouldn't write this while angry, but man, this was not a complicated order. I was the only one there! Three people were up front working, overseeing, and engaging with me. 4, if you count the cook in the back. At one point the owner/manager asked me in what in hindsight appeared to have been mocking disbelief, \"YOU know what DAL is??\" Yes. I dated a Pakistani woman, and I've worked in India. Did those fun facts throw everyone off their game?  4-stars for the taste of what I did receive, but a serious infraction for the negligent rip-off, the disproportionate amount of rice, all of which resulted in an over-priced meal of things not even present. Why is it so difficult to find a respectable South Asian fast-food joint in this town?  **I wonder if I can still get that free tea for a review and check-in after this",

I ordered the chicken seekh kabob dinner plate and the Mister ordered the beef seekh kabob plate. Both were made pretty much the same way and looked like crumbly meat sausages - I guess that's what they're supposed to look like? The beef seekh was good, but the chicken was kind of dry. The rice was flavorful and very loose, not stuck together like some other places. The salad had zero flavoring because there was no dressing, so I ate the cucumbers, but that was it. Stuffing the chicken seekh and rice in the naan bread and adding some of the green sauce made it taste much better, but spicier. I only finished most of one kabob, the second I took with us to go. The Mister also ordered hummus. Is Indian hummus that much different than Mediterranean hummus? The Mister usually LOVES hummus, but this one was very watery, almost like a thin sauce rather than a dip. He left the majority of it on the table, which is unheard of for him! Overall, glad we tried it, but don't think we'll be returning. It's unfortunate that we didn't like the food much because the staff was very friendly and inviting. Really liked them!",

It just looked like deep fried chicken wings but the batter was a little spicy. Both things looked like something I can easily whip up at home.

Knowing the Indian culture it was the same greeting I would expect as if I was walking into a town village in India.  Unlike other Indian food restaurants this place was considerate to their non Indian customers by using the right blend of curry. Just enough to maintain their unique flavor without creating an overwhelming aroma other cultures may not find pleasing.  In fact the Golden Key Plaza culturally diverse in itself with a mixture of restaurants ranging from Southeast Asia to Central Mexico. Offering a variety of dining experience for those with inquisitive appetites.   Kabob N More caters to satisfy the appetite with a setting that pleases the peaceful minds. A most fitting combination as the well known Hindu proverb states. \"One with a peaceful mind always sees a village as a celebration.\"",

    "text": "So, the thing is .. no matter how much you are into other cuisines and adore the local food and all .. one fine day you would reach a tipping point and feel like having something from your cuisine .. happens with most of the people out there and I am no exception. Oh !! by the way, an Indian into Paki restaurant might not be politically correct :( but food wise there is hardly any difference :) .. the meat curries are the same as we do and the tandoor is lighted the same way as well :) ..  That day the need for having a curry with roti (bread) was at its peak, a friend asked me to neglect the likes of famed Indian places and rather move along with him to the far side of the strip where there was this old school restaurant which was serving some really good food. Asked me to ignore the ambiance and sittings but focus just on the food.  So, we walked .. past venetian, wynn and reached at the place which surely was quite quiet but the owner was loud as a lady :) .. Felt like home with the chaos in the kitchen and to see things going in a hurry .. restlessness and all. Ordered a few things .. mutton (goat) biryani, chicken korma, naans and raita .. tea was complementary :) ..   Let me describe the things right then - the goat biryani was aromatic and the rice was separated nt mushy .. a bit more meat in there would have made it perfect but pairing it with the raita .. I did not have any complaints :) the chicken korma - or in layman let us say chicken curry. It was rich and mildly spiced .. the naans were fabulous. They were soft and fluffy due to yeast in them (often called khamiri roti .. khamir = yeast) And then the tea (chai) to end it all .. perfect way to finish the absolutely wonderful meal we had.  And the friends enjoyed it so much that not only did they recommend the restaurant but they also visited it the next day .. on repeat order .. :P .. crazy people.  All in all, given the likes of famous Indian joints .. this small Pakistani restaurant has got its own market and own share of fans .. and they are satisfied feeding them :) .. Great food .. will visit again :)",

It was early afternoon and we were probably thr first customers so they treated us extra nice. I know indian/pakistani places can annoy you sometimes when it comes to customer service or type of food expectations you carry, but you need to know what specific things to order from a certain place.   Desi food has so many different ways of cooking it. Indians usually cook it differently from pakistanis and sometimes it comes down to one secret ingredient that makes an average biryani the best biryani you ever had. When you learn that any place has an indian cook, then it might have delicious curry or veggie items but not the karhayi chicken you must have had in pakistan. People need to pick their food according to the place and not expect everything to be according to what they have the taste for.   I am from Pakistan and I would never order a karhayi chicken from a place where an indian makes it or if its an indian restaurant. They dont know how to make it. Its that simple.",

The Nihari and naan were fine but for the gyros I specifically asked the owner if it was authentic Greek gyros that was cut off of the spit and he said yes so I ordered it. What I got was philly steak meat on a pita. When I asked the owner he snatched the plate from my hand and said you dont want it fine you don't need it and took it away. When I told him I asked him if it was authentic he said this is authentic. I come from Chicago one of the food capitals of the Country I know what an authentic Gyros sandwich looks like, I mentioned that the website and menu board above his head clearly showed a picture of strips of meat and not a mince to which he replied you dont want it and people post what ever they want. Also told me the meat off of the spit was inedible that's why they have to mince it on the grill. But it was his own restaurant menu board showing the gyros sandwich with strips of meat. Never going back to this establishment ever again very very rude people and the food was mediocre.",

If you want to go a little more inexpensive they do have a gyro, fries and small drink special for $8 that isn't on the interior menus. It's on a board outside, but I didn't see it until after I ordered as it was facing the opposite direction that I walked up from.  They do pizza and burgers too but I think that's just to placate kids. I'd stick with the Pakistani food here which is clearly their specialty.",

Finally someone comes with no apology, bad English and asks what I want.  I ordered a \"large\" pizza and two Kabob meals.  He charges me for XL pizza   At this point I didn't want to argue , I'm already hungry with my family  waiting outside I paid the guy and told him I'll be back in 20 mjn.   I came back 30 mjn later , now there fighting with another customer over how they over charged them and I'm there waiting again.  This is all crazy.   Sum it up , food was terrible , kabob was dry with no flavor , pizza hmmm stick to a pizza joint.  Not a Pakistani place that makes pizza and other things.

    "text": "Got the kabob grill platter and everything was smokey delicious! Smelled like real live coals burning in the back. The food took some time to come out (30 min) , but they were pretty busy and we had a large order. We got the cheese naan that was different and had a pillowy outside with chewy center. Lamb biriyani was tender and rich (greasy). It's supposed to be greasy people , especially if they are using ghee! You use the naan to sop all that goodness up. Hummus was flavorful , this style wasn't as thick as other styles of hummus. This was perfect for the naan. BOH can improve & push out food a little faster. 30 min wait didn't bother me for the amount of food ordered. Food came out hot and fresh. The portions may seem small for the price,  but I'm paying for the late after midnight eats. Surrounding kabob shops close by 9pm.   Ya, they don't really care about bussing tables and keeping them squeaky clean , but I seen them wipe em down with cleaner. Fahim the owner is a character and has his own sense of humor. A mild Kebab nazi that turns off customers at times. He's not being rude, your just experiencing a little bit of Fahims culture and character. \"You wanna bring water bottle from outside? I don't care ,just order some food!\" The owner cracks me up , so sensitive people who have no patience stay away.   Your on the strip , he's open til early a.m. and that's the service I pay for. I would suggest they take the please wait to be seated sign down and put a sign up saying order at counter first to clear up the confusion when you walk in.",

But here's the key...the food was excellent!    We ended up going there twice.  We tried a 3rd time but they only had kabobs when we went too early.  I ate vegetarian, the wife & two kids ate meat.  Everyone was happy.  chicken tikka saag paneer lentils with fried onion mixed vegetable curry  All good.  Strongly spiced without being overwhelmingly spicy hot.  We're not Indian or Pakistani.  But we're pretty familiar with the food.  Mostly from NYC restaurants.  This was among the best we've had. There were also, what looked to be, Pakistani families eating at the other tables.   Always a good sign with ethnic food, if that ethnicity eats there.  Very friendly & accommodating young man served us.  Warning though, they charge for rice.  Unheard of in NYC.  Maybe normal in Las Vegas.  $4/plate.",

    "text": "When I was married, this was my husbands favorite restaurant in Vegas.  We would get off the plane and head straight there. I separated happily about a year ago and had not returned to eat here.  However, a Muslim friend was in town and he needed to find Halal food, so we ended up back at kabobs and more.  I had liked the place before so no biggie.  Man was I shocked to see how filthy this place is!  When my ex and I used to go, it was under construction and they were putting in a nice sitting area off the kitchen. Honestly, it appears to have not been cleaned since.   I asked the owner if someone would wipe a table for us and he replied \"take any table\"  I explained they were all dirty. He started speaking in his native tongue to an employee - I did not understand it and I didnt think they would expect my friend to understand it either, but he did.  Apparently they were complaining about having to wipe the table. The employee came in all cranky and put out and literally wiped off about 25% of the filth that was there.  Everything had crust and thick grease on it. The place is really disgusting and I would hate to see the kitchen if they let the dining room stay that gross.  And speaking of thick grease - I got chicken tikka masala, because i am white and that's what we eat in these places.  It was literally half oil. That was ok because i was too grossed out to eat anyway, but i remember the tikka masala being good before.  The naan was pretty good and came on a paper plate still very hot, so i ate it because i was pretty sure it was safe.   Much like the ex husband, I will be looking for another halal restaurant for my friends and will never go again. As for my ex - I hope he enjoys the filth!  ;)",

Of course, naan and rice are not included, so you will have to pay extra for that. The restaurant is like a hole in the wall...not the cleanest.   What I do like is that they have a little seating area for customers outside the restaurant.",

I have a very high tolerance for spice and I still thought it was pretty spicy. The owner is also really ride to guests and employees too. A guy walked in while I was here and asked if he could use the restroom the owner started telling at him and told him to leave. The other workers were nice and they seemed like they were afraid of the owner. Not worth the trip off the strip to come here, but we thought it might be. We were wrong.",

Recommended by a few Pakistanis, I went in the hope of goat meat dishes prepared in our typical Hyderabadi Biryani style. Last 2 days of our trip, we had food there. Both days, I had bad motion, obvious stomach disorder and on return immediately, fever due to infection. I spent 12 days in Vegas during the New Year 2017, but 10 days I was absolutely in top condition.  I had ordered chicken kabab and mutton curry on the first day, while mutton biryani and curry the next day. My mother also had stomach disorder the second day and threw up while in flight. Though the taste of food is reasonable, but its not worth a stomach upset. Please don't take the risk folks!",

Who carries themselves so unprofessionally when you're in the restaurant business? Oh well the reviews speak for themselves.  The cashier dude who was the manager or the owner was really impatient cause we were deciding what to eat. Jesus this is our first time in your restaurant and you're telling us to hurry up and order when there's no one inside LOL!  Rice was old! And the man didn't want to give us water because he said Vegas water would get us sick but I think he was just trying run up the tab on us with a measly 2 dollars! Lol talk about desperation!   Meat is dry and not very tasty.   Honestly I've had better.  Better off eating at the Denny's down the street",

The food is okay but the owner has to work on his attitude otherwise people will stop going there. The ONLY reason he still gets customers is because its the only halal desi restaurant around the strip. I am a foodie and  have been to hundreds of restaurants in my life but have never experienced this kind of shi**y customer service. I also agree with one other reviewer on how the owner gives preferential treatment to some people. When we were there (12/22/2014)there was a family whose table the owner kept visiting and asking if everything was okay. He even took their check saying that he was going to reimburse them.   Like another reviewer I asked a couple questions about the menu and was \"advised\" to make up my mind standing on the side before I ordered.  I would love to see this place closed down on my next trip to Vegas.",

You pay upfront like at a fast food restaurant and the tip is asked about upfront as well if you're paying with a card. How do I know how much to tip if I haven't experienced the customer service or the food quality yet?  When they brought out our food to the table, we were surprised to see the paper plates and plastic utensils. Customer service was fine, but the food was mediocre at best. These types of dishes are not meant to be served fast food style and the quality and the taste of the food suffered greatly because of it. Haleem tasted like lentil soup, Chicken Tikka Masala tasted as if it was just reheated, and the Bihari Kabob (beef dish) wasn't cooked all the way through. They charge dine-in restaurant type prices for fast food.  Not worth it. I was very disappointed with my experience.

    "text": "The last thing I thought walking in here after a busy day of sight-seeing on the strip was that it would be phenomenal! And also, as fair warning, this is the first time I had a gyro so I may not be an expert on the matter. :) The reason we walked in here was because there was a sign advertising pizza outside, but when we walked in the choices were overwhelming! With my girlfriends on a bachelorette party we wanted something pretty filling before a night of clubbing in Vegas, and we each got their Gyro meal with fries and a drink.  First thing to note, their drinks do not come with free refills. The customer service from the owner was great though. Constantly came over to see if we needed anything else. And he initially declined to refill our drinks but then said if we left a review, he would give us all refills... (I would've left a review either way, so this part didn't bother me)  Second thing to note, remember when I said we originally walked in for pizza? Don't get the pizza or or \"american\" food here. Two of the girls we traveled with had the pizza, and hated it. For this Kabob n More loses a star, butitit was also the reason we walked in, so I guess it's a good thing they have it? Oh well, small catch 22.  Now, onto the gyro. It was AWESOME! The bread was great, which was surprising. Soft and fluffy, didn't taste stale or like it had been sitting out at all. The sauce, was incredible! Once again, my first gyro so it was surprising how good it was. The lamb/beef was cooked to perfection and not chewy but a perfect mix with the bread, sauce, lettuce and tomatoes. All the ingredients really meshed very well together.  Also, the fries! This is another reason I was surprised the pizza was terrible since the fries were fresh, thick, and delicious. Totally addicting since we were all eating them off each other's plates.  At the end of the day, a great CHEAP lunch or before dinner snack. Just remember, don't get the pizza. I only tried the gyro, but if I had time, I would've definitely done back to sample some other meals on their menu!",

Whoever in the world was working cashier the day (I think it was the owner) when I came in was complete incompetent, rude, and I'm going to go ahead and say slightly racist. I came in for a convention (asd) and when I came in, the cashier was like \"oh what do you want again?\". I was kind of shocked. Maybe the guy was talking through his bluetooth or something. No. This guy says that I go there like every day and some other comments were said which I don't remember. I guess all Mexicans look alike or something. This guy is completely crazy, so I didn't say anything. I still ordered and even tipped the place on their mediocre food.  Yeah. To top it off, this place has mediocre food. I'd forgive the rudeness, racism if atleast the food was great or even cheap. No. This place is overpriced and it's not worth it. There's not enough meat/substance and too much onion on their items. Nothing horrible, nothing special, just tolerable food.   It tastes like how I would imagine prison food tastes like. I would never eat at this place ever again even if I was paid. If the owner is reading this, I sincerely hope your place goes out of business.   Peace.",

The naan they apparently make fresh in house; and it is my favorite naan I've had outside of Pakistan.  I ordered the mixed kabob plate, which came with some salad and rice and orange chatni. The kabobs were great, although I wish they had a little more spice. The technique they use to roll the kabob was similar to how my mother makes it. The rice was nice, although I personally don't like any rice.   The chatni was superb. The Orange one was a little sweet and had a melted buttery texture. The green chatni had the spice I was looking for. I practically drank it after I was done with my meal.   The meal was prepared in a reasonable amount of time, the staff was really nice and the restaurant itself was in pretty good shape. The manager took time to chat with the patrons, which is nice. If I ever come back to Vegas, this will absolutely be my first stop.",

Me and my friends order simple chicken Schwarma wraps and wait in the dining area. About 20 minutes later only one of us gets our plate. The server didn't even look like he knew what he was doing AND I saw his hands touch our food when he served it which is disgusting. The rest of us were waiting for another 15 minutes which is a ridiculous time to wait for a simple wrap. The cashier and server came into the dining room to ask what we ordered about 3 times. It's really not that hard. Just make a chicken wrap 4 times.   They then asked other diners what they ordered which shows us just how unorganized they are. When I eventually got my food I had more fries than an actual wrap. Service horrible and food sub par. Not coming back.",

I'm not eating from a place that has a guy preparing the food with a tooth pick in his mouth! We just took our food and left! Didn't even bother eating it! It's literally sitting there no a bite taken! Disgusting! I'm reporting this to the health department! Guarantee you they will find a few violations!  Not a clean place! I even thought about disputing my charges with the bank but it's $28 not worth it better yet go never door to the taco place best food you will not regret it!",

People are tired and want to have some decent food but when we eating then the super talkative owner comes to eat your brain. If you are from India( owner is from Pakistan) then he will make sure he will talk more. He will ask where you born , once you tell your city name then  somehow he will make his connection to your city. He would tell you his uncle lives in that city and he knows many people there. Then he will start talking about the indian politics Modi, RSS etc.  Mr. Owner we want to eat does not want to listen to your crap talk. Customer talking is good but you annoys. IF YOUR INDIAN THEN REDAY FOR HIS TALK.   p.s : Food is decent.",

Beware the food is spicy like actually spicy so if you can't handle the heat don't bother coming cause they don't adjust the heat levels for you here  Chicken Tikka & Beef Tikka Boti - SUPER DRY, skip this if you're eating here, the minced options might be better but these chicken and beef chunked kebobs were not   Chicken Biryani - Probably my favorite dish of the 3 the chicken itself was actually soft and fell off the bone and was juicy, the sauce it was cooked in was also very delicious. I wasn't a big fan of the rice though, it was bland and on the harder side   Beef Nihari - This one was the spiciest of the 3 ! Also note that it doesn't come with rice or anything so make sure you order a side if you're getting this",

I left the place around 730p and accidentally dropped my wallet around at the booth where we were sitting. No knowing, we left the place and headed back to our Venetian Hotel where we were staying. Right as I was getting out of Uber, I realized my wallet was missing. I immediately called the restaurant and the cashier looked at the counter then checked the booth where we sat but reported no sign of wallet. Meanwhile, I asked the Uber to take me back to the restaurant. Yes, I was terrified... Can you imagine the horror of losing IDs, money, CCs, etc while 2305 miles from home!?  Frightened at all the excruciatingly painful process I may have to go through to replace each and every CC, ID, Insurance and health card... I just stopped thinking about it and prayed for the best.  Before the Uber could pull into the parking lot after a short 6 mins ride the owner of the restaurant called and confirmed he had a wallet in his possession.  As soon as I walked-in, the owner, Fahim Akhtar, handed me my wallet and asked me to check the cash and IDs, which I did. Everything was in order, thank God! This was a fantastic find and save. Kudos to Kabob N More's entire staff. Oh yeah, Beef Seekh Kabab with Basmati rice, butter Naan, and Gyro were very good.",

I visit las Vargas for my some business concerns and I'm staying a 5 star resort and as a Muslim I like to eat halal food. Mentioning 5 star resort mean I can effort to order any were in las Vargas , just want to shut their fucking mouths before this place management start yelling and judging me after reading this review about their business! Like typical Pakistani business owners ! Well , come to the point, I really had a busy and exhausted day and when I come back to my room I really don't have power to go out for Dinner so I find this halal place but it was very late so I use post mate and paid extra for delivery but when I get my food and take first bite , I just feel to slap so hard that person right in his face who gave the onwards to cook this food !  Again you are not fucking representing your self , you are representing Pakistan you assholes ! If you don't know how to cook Pakistani food then shut your business down and go back to Pakistan , I can't see to dis owner my country this bad ! I order goat Karahi , the thing I receive is not even close to goat curry , feel like the person just put water and meat together and mix with too much salt and spices and sent to me ! Sorry for my language but when you are hungry for whole day and get food like this ?  Well just want to say , Pakistan is already in pretty bad image so don't let Pakistan down more and more , teach the cook how to cook , Whole USA know how Indian food is! But if they don't know they can google and find out and they are not that much dumb if you think they are ! And Im talking about myself , couz I know I'm not gonna order again at this place , but don't making fool to America! You dumb !",

On my four day trip to Vegas, I have already been there twice and will try one more time before to leave.

And on top of the that they added an extra dollar charge inside. So why do you guys still have the sign up?! The meals on the menu have \"all the kabobs come with sides\" and yet the guy wants to charge us more for sides. They have a outdated menu which they do not honor. The customer service is horrible. It's pretty much no service or the bare minimum to get the customers money. I do no recommend coming to this place at all.",
