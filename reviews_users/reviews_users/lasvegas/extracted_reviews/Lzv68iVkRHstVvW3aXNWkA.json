Tip: ask for a coconut when you sit down, you'll be happy drinking coconut water out of a coconut - then eating the meat from the inside with a spoon! (Ask them to shave the sides for you though, as sometimes they don't. Unless you're up for a challenge with your meal.) the menu features veg and vegan options, (ask if other things can be made vegan, my favorite is Tom Kha  Kai as spicy as possible with tofu made vegan.) there are special plates/boxes, and as always, if you've never had one - you MUST get a Thai Ice Tea (only if you have a sweet tooth though.) You won't be disappointed. :)",

Only negative was I ordered a 4 spicy, on a 1-5 scale and it wasn't spicy at all. I had to ask for the spice tray to adjust to my liking. If you like spicy you may want to ask for the spice tray up front since they don't automatically have them at the table.  Overall, good restaurant, good food, great ambiance and friendly staff.

It has been my favorite restaurant for months.  We have had the Massuman Curry, Tom Kha Soup, Thai Tea Crepe Cake, Mango Sticky Rice, Spicy Eggplant, Salmon with Mango Salsa, and their amazing Thai ice tea with coconut milk. They always make sure everything is safe for my friend, and it's always delicious.  It's easy to tell that their food is homemade. Whether I eat here or order delivery, the quality is consistent. A nice, rich, and creamy Tom Kha with the right amount of lemongrass can be hard to come by, but Table Thai does it right. If you have a sweet tooth, the Thai Tea Crepe Cake is a must have. The food is amazing, and they always remember a friendly face. This is definitely a place worth visiting and returning to.",

    "text": "Being a new restaurant, we came in with no expectations, and left with a new favorite place!  VIBE: cozy with wooden accents, tufted chairs, crown napkin folds. The atmosphere resembles something more native to that of the downtown LV joints -- trendy, but without the crowd (yet). Another indicator of their hipness is the fact they serve their drinks in mason jars. Yes! I had a thai tea and my sister had the thai coffee. Pretty to look at and a generous portion, for only $3. Young coconut for the same price. Sweet deal. Please don't ever change this!  SERVICE: Our waitress was attentive and frequently asked how everything was going. Our dishes timely cleared, waters were constantly filled, though my glass had a small water stain. Side note: Although the name suggests a bar, I didn't really feel like it's much. They do offer wine and beer, though.  FOOD: To start, my family had the Asia Sampler (a combo of shumai, shrimp, satay, spring rolls), but I'd suggest just getting the shumai by themselves, as the other three weren't anything special. We also got the shrimp tom yum soup -- Drained all of our sinuses, spicy, but in a good way.  Our main dishes: duck curry, yellow curry, asparagus with shrimp, teriyaki chicken, pad thai, and pad see ewe, all ranging from $9-$13. Some came with either white or brown rice. My favorite was the pad see ewe. Although they use the good chicken, the yellow curry seemed a little watery and the potatoes weren't tender enough. For dessert, we wanted to try the thai tea crepe cake, but it wasn't available. We settled for the mango with sticky rice and some coconut ice cream instead. Hit the spot. Great presentation. We'll be back!",

When I think of Weera, Kin Thai, Siri Thai, Sakun Thai, Naga, Gaati, Komol, Lotus of Siam, Lucki and all the other places in town, I love coming back to Table Thai Bar and Bistro.  1. Service - The staff here are very nice and friendly. You always feel welcome here.  they are very attentive and making sure you are taken care of. Even when it is busy, they are available.  2. The Food - The food here is great.  Lunch - For about 7-10 dollars, you can order 1 of about 10 specials from curry to spicy basil or pad thai.  Your will have a nice lunch size serving of the dish, as well as soup, rice and a small salad. I find that this is a great deal and the amount of food is just right.  Great food, great flavor and great price. Can't beat that.  Entrees - They have just about any and all Thai dish that you could want.  I won't go into any great details as the choices are similar everywhere.  Here are some highlights though:  Ground Meat - I love to have ground pork on my Thai dishes and some places have it, and some don't. HEre they have the ground pork. It captures the sauce and spicy flavors so much better than larger cuts of meat.  The best part, is that they can do ground chicken as well.  I generally prefer the consistency of the ground meats in Thai cooking. Not many places can do ground pork or ground chicken!  Tom Yum - I always enjoy it when the soup comes out in the soup hot pot with the fire in it steaming. Here it is just right and slurpiliciously good.  Vegan Menu - Many places will have a vegetarian menu, but here they have a separate Vegan menu. That is great, especially since the daughter has been a vegan now for about 5 months.  3.  Ambiance - The amount of tables, the design and everything about this very small restaurant is just right. I love coming here with the family and also on business lunch meetings.  GK says, check it out. One of my favorite Thai restaurants.",

It was prime time dinner hour (around 7-7:30p) and there was only one other table besides us.   First star removal: no wine and liquor? Why not?  But yet there's the word \"bar\" in your name. By all means, I'm no alcoholic. I actually can't stand the taste of alcohol. My boyfriend simply wanted a glass of wine to go with his dinner. They're been open for what?.....about 6 months now? Or more? Why are they still waiting for their liquor license?   Second star removal: the food. Just wasn't very tasty. Bland chicken + shrimp pad thai. Not flavorful at all. And only 2 shrimps!?! For a dinner sized entree!? I ordered the chicken thai basil fried rice. Definitely didn't look like FRIED RICE. It was more like mushy rice. The rice was all stuck together and it was kinda.....soggy....if that makes sense. Maybe the rice was under-cooked? Chicken was dried too. Tasted even worse as leftovers and I am NOT a snob when it comes to eating my food two days in a row. I actually love leftovers, but not with this. Minus another star for that.  Only good thing was the appetizer sampler. Two vegetable eggrolls, three chicken satays and 3 shui mais. At least they made that good. We came, we saw, we're done.",

Everything I have had on the menu is delicious but my absolute favorite is the spicy eggplant and though I am not a vegetarian or vegan, I get it with tofu. Definitely a place my best friend and I love coming to and will continue coming to!",

I ordered the pineapple fried rice. There wasn't anything amazing to write home about. A tad pricey given a fairly average entree. I will say that when I was there, the service was on point. Maybe because there weren't a lot of people on a Friday afternoon, but at least we weren't being ignored. +1 for making an effort to check in with us multiple times.",

I would recommend going to another place for authentic Thai.",

I loved the way the vegan menu was on the first page and everything was nicely explained.   I ended up choosing the Tropical Tofu and I was not disappointed, the flavors were wonderful. The portion size was huge, in fact I am finishing up my leftovers tonight. Very good pricing for the amount and quality of the food you get. I really appreciated the fact that if I had wanted something not on the Vegan menu they would have made changes to make it vegan.   The restaurant itself has a very good energy, nicely decorated and warm. I will be back to dine in when I have more time to enjoy and relax. Oh, and they offer online ordering and delivery service.",

Everything we ordered was delicious and served to our room in less than the 45 min wait we were quoted. The food was still very warm and each dish was delicious. You can order the degree of spice you wish and we found a 2-3 out of 5 to have a bite but was not overpoweringly hot.   We had the ShunMai which were amongst the best we've ever tasted. The pad see eiw was prepared with delicious thin, wide noodles in a gravy with broccoli ( and we added tofu). It was much lighter than many of the noddles you often get with this dish.  Finally the yellow curry was superbly flavored.  As regular consumers of Asian food in Boston, we were totally impressed. If you are in the LV airport area, we'd highly recommend this place.",

For appetizers we had the dumplings (I forgot the actual name) but they were SO yummy. We also had the chicken satay, which were just OK in my opinion. For entrees, my friend and I both had the lunch specials and the chicken curry and pad Thai were both very satisfying and the prices were great. The spice level is also adjusted to your preference which was also great. We ended our meal with the Thai tea crepe cake which is a definite must try! Overall, this is a great restaurant and I will definitely be back to try some more of their great menu items:)",

    "text": "I just want to give this place a shout out for understanding the Vegan life! When I called to order my pad Thai with tofu, they asked if I was okay with egg. I was happy to see they were cautious of people's potential diet choices. Especially to those people who are new, such as myself and may not know that this dish contained egg.  They also helped me pick an app over the phone that was vegan friendly. When I came in and asked what soup they had available the lady (who didn't take my order) asked if I was vegan and offered Tom kah or something of that nature. Which of course correlated with the diet.  I ordered my pad Thai extra spicy and the soup spicy, they were both phenomenal. I also had an order or crispy veggie rolls, which were delicious with the plum sauce. Thanks for the great food! I'll be back soon!",

    "text": "I spent a long time contemplating my thoughts on this place,  and after several times getting take out, I feel it's time to give it a review.   A large part of my hesitation was based on how disconnected my feelings were about the food to the star ratings they had accumulated.  I kept waiting to be wowed,  and find an item that I found cravable.     The only item I found that I really enjoyed was the crab rangoons.   The wrapper is fried just right,  has a great crunch,  and the filling has good texture,  not just one note cream cheese.  Also their dipping sauce pairs well.  After that everything becomes either average, or below...   The first time I came here I got their chicken satay. While it was tender the amount of peanut sauce they give is very stingy.   It is also more of a curry base and less of the more creamy coconut some places have.  The cucumber salad is also more liquid then salad. Last, but not least several bone fragments were in my chicken,  which I have never had anywhere.  I found it odd so I contacted the business,  and I will say they have very good client recovery.   They apologized,  said this was an isolated incident,  and offered a free chicken satay to prove so on my next visit.   They also threw in a free rice and Thai tea.   I was impressed with their customer service. Also,  thank goodness never have I had another bone incident.   I also made sure the other times when I ordered on line to ask for no jalapenos in my salad, and they were always great about modifying. Still flavor wise I prefer Thai houses chicken satay.   I found their Tom ka soup OK the first time I went when I got it with tofu,  however when I got it with chicken the second time it was to salty,  and the chicken had a weird texture.   The pad seew was really disappointing,  no dimensions in flavor, and the second time it looked like they cooked egg seperatly and just tossed it on,  so it was not coated in the sauce,  just super weird. Their was another flat noodle dish that my boyfriend tried it was on the spicier side, so while the flavor was good a 3 out of 5 was to hot for me to eat more than a bite of.  So keep in mind at least that night they  definatly ran Thai hot. I normally like thai tea to cool down the the heat,  but theirs is to sweet,  and not very flavorful.   They do have a vegan menu which I know some will appreciate,  although I have not tried it. Also,  one of the reason I gave so many chances was they are open about an hour later than most Thai places near me. I really want to like this place more,  maybe I'm not ordering what they are known for.   Until I figure out what that is I'll just keep ordering here when my normal spots are closed.",

Me and a buddy ordered the crab rangoons, thai tea, beef pad see ewe (level 4 hot) and drunken noodles (level 5 hot). Flavor was not bad but spiciness was way off - my level 4 wasnt spicy at all and my buddies level 5 was only slightly spicy. I understand every person is going to be different in how they determine spiciness, but if you ordered the highest level of spicy at a THAI restaurant I expected something with at least a decent kick to it. Crab rangoons were only okay.  Overall the food wasn't super impressive and the spice levels were way off, however the service was great. I wouldn't mind trying this restaurant again but will definitely be visiting other thai places before heading back here.",

    "text": "A few years ago, there was a place here called Taiga serving up Thai and Japanese. Then they closed and were replaced by what we have now.  Tonight, I finally tried Table Thai Bar & Bistro, the \"new\" restaurant at this spot. They're much more focused on Thai food, with a little overlap into Chinese cuisine and possibly Vietnamese, and they seem to have impressed several of my Yelp friends. One of my friends from the Taiga era pulled up the listing when I said that I wanted to go somewhere new to write a review, although I probably would've insisted on something a bit fancier if I'd realized this would be my milestone 700th.  Then again, I've always liked the more affordable and approachable restaurants, which Table Thai definitely is. They have two televisions that were set to Monday Night Football on ESPN, which tonight so happened to feature my hometown and favorite team the 49ers. The music is quiet piano/instrumental stuff, which is relaxing and not at all bothersome. The servers were good and kept refilling our water.  Since I was aware of the lunch specials, I deliberately avoided ordering items on that menu in anticipation of getting better value on possible future visits.  For an appetizer, we shared Duck Rolls ($8), which is basically two fresh-tasting spring rolls w/ duck meat and a delicious sauce.  For my entree, I picked Pad See Eiw with beef ($10), which is definitely among the better renditions of that dish and has plentiful beef, some egg, and... wait, normal broccoli instead of Chinese broccoli? Well, it still gives the right veggie crunch, so it's not a terrible substitution, just an inexplicable one. My chosen spicy level of 1 (out of 5) was fairly subtle, and heat-tolerant eaters probably won't detect anything.  My friend ordered Crab Fried Rice ($15), which had tasty crab meat and fresh cherry tomato among other ingredients. He got it with a spicy level of 2, which was very noticeable but not sweat-inducing for me. It's not too greasy as far as fried rice goes, and I could see myself ordering it again after having had just a couple of bites.  We also shared a dessert, namely the seasonal Mango Sticky Rice ($7). Fresh, sweet mango and hot, sweet, glazed rice balls with a slightly crunchy topping (plus a couple of maraschino cherries for garnish) definitely hit the spot.  Yes, there will be future visits to Table Thai Bar & Bistro. It's a good (albeit very dim at night) restaurant with plenty of menu left to be explored. And yes, there will (hopefully) be 700 more reviews to come.",

Spicy level 3 was enough to get my lips to tingle a bit. I am not a thai food connoisseur, but this place was pretty darn good. It was just as good as, if not better than, some of the good thai places that I used to go back home in OC. My friend who is very picky seemed to like this place so that must mean something.

You can tell they did not hold back the budget to make sure people were seated very comfortably. I appreciate the touches. Now let's get to the food.   I think that for Thai food to be priced really high you better make sure you are adding those extra touches that make you feel like you are getting your money's worth and they did great in that area as well.   The only critique I have is again I'm sorry but when it comes to Thai food Im very picky about it so for me to give a 4 star rating means they are good enough to come back to. My fave fish was probably the crying tiger and the spicy catfish. Execution and flavor was on point. I think their pad see ew needs some work. It's too sweet. Will definitely come back to enjoy more food.",

The Garlic Lamb Chops were easily the best lamb chops i've ever had. It was juicy and super tender. The yellow curry was rich and full of flavor. It was loaded with chicken that was perfectly cooked and juicy as well along with carrots and potatoes. The Pad Thai was simply delicious! The Asia sampler had egg rolls, satay chicken sticks, fried shrimp, dumplings, and cucumber relish. Everything was full of flavor and if it doesn't have enough to your liking, they have a platter of delicious dipping sauces.   The service was superb, they even box your food for you. They were super welcoming and the cook even came out front to see how we liked everything. You can tell they take pride in their cooking.  The atmosphere is the best and the lighting makes it even better. Very good for a date night out.  All in all, i had an amazing experience!",

We ordered the following:  Panang Soft shell crab $13  Curry puff $7  Thai Iced Tea $3  Mixed Veggies with Beef $7  Everything was great! The soft shell crab and mixed veggies dish came with soup, rice, and salad. As another reviewer said, the portions they serve is just right and its a good deal. Their lunch specials run about $7-14 which is great. The crab in curry was awesome. I was happy also to have been asked by the waitress beforehand how spicy I wanted it. My wife's dish was tasty too. The curry puffs were tasty as well. It had potato and vegetables with some curry wrapped in pastry. It kind of reminded me of indian food too. Overall, I have to put this resto in the top 3 thai restos alongside Lotus of Siam and Arawan Thai Bistro.",

They have the best spring rolls I've tried throughout town, and our server was very sweet. After the past two experiences I have had there, it pains me to say that I'll never come back.  Food - still good. It's nice that they add a separate vegan section to their menu, and the spicy herb bed tofu was very different and flavorful, but when I order a 5 out of 5 and was able to eat it with no rice and taking only a few sips of water, I'm not trying to be a badass. You are doing something wrong. However, as far as flavor goes, it is very yummy here.  Service - This is the entire reason we will not come back. One of the servers there, whose name I can't remember, and I am sorry for that, is awesome. She's shorter than the other servers that I have seen there. She works very hard for her guests and has a very friendly, open attitude.  The other servers are horrible, all of them. Their hours are posted as closing at midnight, but if you show up at 11:20pm, they announce that they're already closed, will seat you begrudgingly, make you order before youre even sested, toss your food onto the table, and rush you out of the door. It is a horrible experience for someone who walked in 40 minutes before they close. Not 10 or 5 minutes. 40, and we were one if four tables in there.  But every restaurant gets a second chance rule, which is why we came back. We had our awesome server, and the only complaint was the food, until right before we left. My friend had walked up to our server to hand her a cash tip, and another server interrupted her and snatched her cash out of her hands. Look, I am a server. I know how things work behind the scenes. I can spot which servers actually care and which servers are low and sheisty. She, who was the same server that rushed us before, was sheisty. She didn't even serve us and yet she still grabbed, actually snatched it from my friends hand, a tip from another table? Argue that they may split tips, it is still very, very rude how she handled the situation. As a regular customer, I don't think I've ever felt so uncomfortable and unappreciated.  Thai table lost 4 customers who used to dine there weekly. I would suggest looking up Komol for a more authentic, spicy, innovative thai food experience with friendly service.",

So be prepared to share and have left overs.   Ordered pineapple fried rice and green curry.  They rate their heat on a 1-5 scale, based on other Thai places I've been to they usually say 1-10. I'd say \"2\" is like a 5 on the heat scale.    I will definitely be going back here in the near future whenever I need to get my fix, especially due to its close proximity to sunset park.  Great date spot for those that would want to go to the park and walk around to talk afterwards.",

I then tried the chicken mixed veggies since this is a simple dish that should show their ability to make a broth. They gave me tofu mixed veggies and again the flavor was pretty lame and the sauce very oily. Would only eat here if I couldn't get to my favorite Thai places: weera tha and David wongs pan Asian.",

We have eaten at many Thai places in Nevada and other states and most of the time you find the taste you are looking for or expect compared to your visit at other places.  This place uses a lot of HOT spices which for me was good, but others with us on this visit are not fans of spice.  They ordered the Orange Chicken and the Sweet and Sour Chicken which are two items I am a huge fan of and I don't know if it was the breading or the sauce was different, but they thought it was ok to not really liking it.  I tried it even though it is not on my list of approved foods to eat right now and I even thought is was less then ok.  The breading was very soggy and did not have a good taste to it and that goes for both chicken dishes.  This is a place we probably enjoyed trying once but will not be on our list to visit again.  There are other places which are just a few steps better and worth going back to.  Sorry to say this is not one of them.",

    "text": "I used to eat here all the time until one time me and my boyfriend got sick and were pretty sure it was from something we ate there based off of the time period. However we were not positive, but it was enough to keep us from coming back. So tonight I was in the area and felt like pad Thai. I decided to give table thai another shot...I was initially shocked when I was charged 12.99 for vegetable pad Thai Togo. I would have never ordered it had I known it was going to be so expensive...by time I saw the price it was too late because I had called in to order Togo and they never told me my total before we hung up. I suppose that's my fault for not asking...I left a $2 tip because I am in the service industry and everyone who works here is super nice. So the vegetable pad Thai was pretty bad...it smelt and tasted like fish and they gave me lemons rather then the limes I had requested. I couldn't even finish it, so I gave the rest to my mom.  Without me even saying anything about the fishy odor and taste my mom mentioned how it smelt and tasted like fish. She thought there was fish in it. Now that to me is pretty gross. For the price and quality I won't be coming back again.  NOTE: after checking the menu just now I have noticed the pad Thai is only $10...still over priced for bad food, but I will be calling and demanding to be refunded and charged the correct price. I'll never come here again. Done.",

    "text": "Came here for dinner tonight.  Elegant interior and decor, great customer service, but I wasn't too impressed with the food itself.    This is a small restaurant.  I arrived between 5:45 - 6:00pm.  There were very few people there, but I was okay with that.  The seats had style and were super comfy.  This is the place to go on a first date.  We ordered the wonton soup, Pad Thai, and Crying Tiger.    A small bowl of wonton soup is $6.  They deliver the dumplings, veggies, and shrimp in the bowl and pour the broth from a mini pitcher at your table.  Very unique way to present your wonton soup.  The flavor was quite different because it had a sweet flavor to it.  Overall, the soup was delicious, but I'm used to the traditional unsweetened and salty broth flavor.  The soup includes pieces of chicken, shrimp, bok choy, carrots, and ofcourse, wontons.    The Crying Tiger is slices of grilled ribeye for $12.  It came with a side of small (I think some kind of chilli oil) sauce.  It was a bit dry and on the bland side.   FInally, the Pad Thai.  It was a bit on the greasy side.  The Pad Thai was big enough to share.  The server didn't ask how spicy we wanted the Pad Thai, so that's probably why they brought it out with a spicy level of 0.  The taste was pretty bland too, but it's nothing that Siracha or hot chilli oil can't fix.    The ambiance is nice, the presentation is nice, but the food itself tasted a little bland.  Overall this was a good experience, but it's not my favorite Thai place in town.",

Crab ragoons were typical but had more crab than I thought. Mango sticky rice is huge. They give you a whole mango and rice with maraschino cherries as a cute addition. Iced Thai coffee was delicious as well.   Note: they don't have any of the Thai iced teas/ coffees or desserts on their eat24 online menu so if you do takeout, make it a note. Quaint little restaurant with sophisticated furnishings. I wouldn't mind dining in.",

The decor is nice and the seating is very comfortable. They have a few TVs on some of our favorite channels so that was a big plus. The waitress was very nice and quick.   The menu is pretty standard, and veggie options were pretty good. We ordered the vegan curry and fried basil rice with no egg and just veggies. They both came out relatively quick. The curry was a pretty small portion and we were both confused about how a veggie curry could be more expensive than the meat and fish curries...(minus one star) the mushrooms were really cold. Which was weird, because everything else was steaming hot. The curry is standard mild spice so make sure you ask for more heat if you like it spicy. The food wasn't bad, but it wasn't super great. Over all, they have some awesome lunch specials that both of us would be willing to go back and try, but as for dinner and the price, go to komol or Nitayyas. They are also still waiting on their beer and wine license, And since it's a bar and bistro, I'm knocking them a star for that. My boyfriend liked the Thai coffee though. Give them a try and make your own opinion.",

With so many Thai restaurants here in Vegas it is hard to find one that is accommodating and affordable, meanwhile tasting delicious! I chose Table Thai after passing by it on my way home several times. I should mention that I am a vegetarian that prefers vegan options. Table Thai had a variety of options as well as were willing to customize my food to my liking. For example Pad Thai is traditionally made with both egg and a fish sauce, which I do not eat. Needless to say, all my food including the Pad Thai, was Vegan! When I got home I was really excited to see the presentation of the food. Furthermore, it was absolutely delicious. I felt extremely satisfied and confident that Table Thai has earned my business! Thank you.",

My wife and I had the jade curry, pad thai, and the crunchy and fresh rolls as an appetizer. Everything was delicious, but the curry stole the show. You'll see from my many reviews that I love curry, and especially green curry, and this may be the best version I've has since visiting Thailand.",

The servers were very attentive about filling our water even though I barely drank it.   I've tried just about every curry here, and they are all awesome! My husband's fav is the Panang curry.   The Tiger steak is good. It is served medium-well and the sauce served with it isn't spicy at all. It's a flavor that you can't really describe, but I liked it.   Thai tea, fresh coconut juice, and thai coffee are recommended ;)  STICKY RICE AND MANGOOOOO &&& THAI TEA CREPE! If there's a dessert out there in the world that can put a smile on a girl's face during here time of the month, it's these two right here!",

Our food was still hot on delivery, very well packaged and even had a little drink holder to make life easier for delivery drivers. We got the Crying Tiger, Pad Thai Thai, Tom Yum, Egg Fried Rice and Thai Tea. The spicy Thai sauce that goes with the Crying Tiger is amazing, I thought it should be more spicy though! The Pad Thai had large portion of juicy chicken and shrimp! The Thai tea is unbeatable. Not watered down or syrupy, it had the perfect flavor and sweetness. Highly recommend trying their food!   Pro Tip- Egg Fried rice is only $4.00 and it was a full sized fried rice meal!",

It also comes with an egg roll and a salad! The portions are big! Especially considering that it is a lunch special.   I recently ordered through Yelp and I was surprised by how fast and easy it was! Everything was ready to be picked up in 10 minutes, despite them being busy when we got to the restaurant.   Other dishes that I've tried include the soft shelled crab panang curry (also offered during lunch if you feel like splurging a little!) And they also offer vegetarian dishes that are so good that you don't even miss the meat. I've tried a crispy tofu dish that was amazing!!   And for dessert, you must try their Thai tea crepe cake! It's so light and fluffy and not overly sweet.",

To me it didn't have that authentic Thai flavor you'd normally expect. Even after we added the wheel of spices. It was still just okay. We had the beef and broccoli, fried rice and eggplant and tofu which was the best dish. The way they prepared the eggplant was new to me and I enjoyed that. If I had a huge craving, I might come back just to order the eggplant Togo.",

The rice was kind of dry, but overall the dish was great.   The Thai iced tea was tasty and it was in a huge mug. Cheaper than most of other Thai places I've been to (which played a small role of me choosing the place).  I'm planning to go back and try their duck curry next time.",

The woman that answered when I called in my order was very friendly. She said my order would be ready when I arrived and didn't even give an amount of time. It took me about 10 minutes to get there and my food was waiting when I arrived. Looking around the restaurant as I paid I was impressed with the inside of the restaurant. It has a clean, modern feeling.   The Pad Thai lunch special was calling my name. It came with a nice portion of pad thai (choice of chicken, pork, or beef), a vegetable egg roll, and a green salad. From the menu it looks like dine in lunch specials come with soup too. Even without soup I ended up having leftover pad thai for the next day. I really liked the flavor of the pad thai dish and the chicken. The green salad had a nice dressing and I enjoyed the flavor of the egg roll too. I would definitely order this dish again.  The lunch specials are an amazing deal. There are 16 different options for $7! Yes, $7! Even with tax and a 20% tip I made it out for $10. I can't think of any places in town where you can find a better deal for a quality meal. Lunch specials include an entree, green salad, vegetable egg roll, soup (for dine in), and rice (unless it's a noodle dish).   I look forward to returning not only to try more of the lunch specials, but to bring my husband for dinner.",

We ordered pad Thai, shrimp fried rice, garlic and pepper chicken, and the Crying Tiger for dinner. The shrimp in the pad Thai and fried rice were huge and had a good serving in each dish. The pad Thai was delicious! The sauce had so much flavor - you could really taste the tamarind, fish sauce, limes, etc. and they put plenty of it on the noodles so they weren't dry. Definitely a must order! The fried rice was authentic Thai style fried rice and packed so much flavor in such a simple dish. The garlic and pepper chicken was the favorite dish of the night. The sauce on it looked so simple yet the flavors were so complex. It had the sweet, the salty, a bit of spice and tang. I would eat just that sauce with a bowl of rice and be satisfied. The Crying Tiger was our let down. It's a rib eye with a kind of spicy vinegar dipping sauce. The sauce was good but the steak itself was so chewy and was cold when they brought it out to us. Wouldn't order it again.   We also ordered a sweet roti and mango with sticky rice for dessert. The roti was perfect with a crispy exterior and soft, fluffy interior and was sweetened with just enough condensed milk. The mango and sticky rice was also good. The mango was ripe but had just a touch of tartness which matched well with the sweetened sticky rice.   Overall, most of the meal was spectacular and we will be back again, for sure.",

The decor is pleasing and the dim lighting makes it feel intimate.  It's a little thrown off by the giant TV mounted in the corner, but I know some people need that during their meal.  We got seated next to a decorative barrel, which I ended up bashing my elbow on several times.  I'm not an enormously tall guy, but the seating arrangement next to the decor was not doing me any favors.  The service was not promising at first.  There was one waitress for the entire restaurant and she was dedicating all of her time to the large party sitting a table over.  Once the other girl came over to help us, service improved.  My wife ordered the Spicy Basil with Tofu, which they unfortunately made with chicken.  Not wanting to be wasteful, she ate it anyway, because she would feel worse about the chicken going into the trash.  It had a good flavor, though not the best Spicy Basil we've ever had.  She also got the Tom Kha soup, which was super yummy.  I got the Crying Tiger.  The sauce was flavorful, though the meal felt like it was missing something.  It was just a bit too much \"here's some meat, enjoy!\"  It wasn't a perfect meal but it was promising enough that we'll be back.",

They bring out a bowl with the mushroom, chicken, lemon grass and herbs. Then pour the broth from a pitcher. Great flavor!    I also had the jade curry with tofu. Very nice.  The vegetable were good quality and not over cooked.  You get quite a bit of food.   Next time, I'll have to bring more people I can sample more dishes!  Definitely eating here again.",

It had regular barely steamed broccoli compared to most that have Asian broccoli ... I asked for extra egg, noodle and sauce and all I got was more dry noodles and definitely not more egg.  My shrimp miso soup was flavorless with three pieces of shrimp that tasted straight out of the freezer :/ I chose this place due to Grubhub and delivery fee being low :/",

    "text": "Took my wife here on her lunch break this afternoon. This place managed to get us well fed and on our way in under an hour which is a pretty great accomplishment in itself.  But that was the thing that impressed me least.  This restaurant is a modest little space tucked away in retail center that you might miss if you aren't looking closely. The parking lot is tight, and often full.    I'm not sure why, but the restaurant only had a few other tables when we were there during the peak lunch hour on a weekday. I can't really complain though, the place was quiet and provided the perfect atmosphere for an afternoon lunch date with my wife.  The place is impeccably clean, and well put together. The decor is less like a traditional Thai restaurant and more like a modern bistro you'd find in an urban restaurant district.  We had two different servers waiting on us, making service as quick and efficient as we could hope for given the circumstance.   I love Thai food, but I can't say I've been the most adventurous when it comes to the menu at most restaurants. Poke fun at me if you must, but I usually get pad Thai, garlic string beans, or basil chicken.   I tried the pad Thai here, which proved to be an excellent choice because it was one of the most enjoyable renditions I've ever had. Not too soft, with a bold, well-balanced smoky  flavor.  I'm not sure why, but I always request the highest spice level (5 at this restaurant), and Thai restaurants never deliver the heat. As with every place, the server asked me if I was sure if I wanted it so spicy, and when I said \"most definitely\", I was brought a mild dish. Maybe they've had too many past experiences where people have requested full spice and couldn't handle it so they didn't want to risk having to remake any more food. I don't know, but when I say I want it hot, i'm not playing games!  No worries though, like all great places, Table Thai has a spice assortment of powder and sauces to kick up the heat of the food to your liking.  My wife got the yellow curry chicken, which she seemed to love, and while it did look delicious, I don't enjoy curry so I can't comment on the flavor of her dish, except to tell you she enjoyed it immensely.  They serve an excellent Thai iced tea in a mason jar glass, which adds an interesting touch to the classic drink. Very nicely done!  The food and drink portions were enormous, especially for a lunch special, which is an impressive $7 meal that includes a soup and salad.  The only item I didn't care for was the soup. It was a little light on flavor in my opinion: a simple broth/onion soup with broccoli and a dumpling. I almost feel bad griping about it because it came with my meal so I didn't pay any extra for it and my wife seemed to really enjoy it.  Overall, I think Table Thai is one of the best Asian restaurants I've tried so far in Las Vegas and I'm so glad we found it!",

    "text": "We have been coming here since they opened and the food/service/cleanliness have always been consistently wonderful.  Even carry out is always top notch.    I have found it hard to find Thai places that are consistent in their spice levels, but the folks at Table Thai always get it right.    Some of our favorites over the years: Pork Larb - the menu only shows chicken, which is yummy.  But you can ask for pork if you prefer.  The pork is still juicy and the larb has the right amount of lime juice.  I like that they provide lettuce leaves to eat it with.  If I had to make a negative comment, I wish they provided more lettuce leaves. Panang curry - We have had this with pork, chicken, duck, and tofu.  I prefer it with the tofu, hubby prefers the duck, and the kids the chicken.  The curry is wonderfully rich and a perfect balance of veggies, protein, and spice. Jade Curry - This is a lighter curry than the panang and always so tasty.  We prefer the chicken or pork but have even had it with beef.  Always a good ratio of veggies, protein, and spice. Yellow Curry - the menu describes the dish with dark meat chicken.  Prepared that way, it is delicious with huge chunks of juicy chicken.  But you can get it with other meats, my son prefers the beef. Crying Tiger - This is the only thing that I think the portion size is \"small\" on.  All the other portion sizes are big, even huge.  But this is definitely a \"single\" serving.  It is the only thing we have never had leftovers of.  Great spicy sauce, but they will serve it on the side if you prefer. Stir-fried eggplant - This is one of our FAVORITE dishes.  Even my children/friends that don't like eggplant love this dish.  It is not what you might expect, because each piece of eggplant is individually battered and fried (very light delicate batter).  We always get it with tofu.  Perfect balance of sweet, spicy, salty... so yummy. Orange Chicken - Not what you think of when you think of orange chicken.  This is not the heavy over sauced version you normally find.  Instead it is light and refreshing, but still filled with orange flavor.   Pad Woon Sen - again, many restaurants use too much oil in this or are too heavy on the noodles vs everything else.  This is perfect flavor, ingredients, texture of the noodles. BBQ San Set - I like this because you get a quarter chicken, sticky rice, and papaya salad.  The chicken is so flavorful and moist, and the papaya salad is a welcome light refresher. Fresh Spring Rolls - This is the best version of spring rolls I have ever had.  Again it is about the ratios, some places put too much noodles or lettuce.  Some don't provide enough dipping sauce or it is too thick.  Most places don't put enough shrimp.  This is the perfect balance.  Other choices, hubby loves the crab rangoon.  We all like the four seasons (i think that is the name) as well as the duck wraps.  Tom Kha Ga is huge, we are always too full to eat our food when we get this.    We also like the Lad Na and the Pas See Ew but again it can get a little heavy since it has the wide noodles and it is hard to not eat it all.    I don't think we've ever even made it to dessert because the portions are so big and the food is so tasty.",

    "text": "Went here for dinner with some friends after taking my exam and I have to say the food here is pretty darn good! It's located in a small plaza and has a dim, sort-of intimate atmosphere.   I ordered the pad thai with chicken and shrimp which looked really good because it had a nice glazed appearance due to the tasty sauce (I hate it when places serve pad thai that looks dry and dehydrated!). I also got a good amount of shrimp (more than 3 pieces!) and chicken. Check out the picture to see for yourself! The quality of the dish as a whole was delicious and I would say it is on par with Naga (although my friends prefer Naga a bit more than here). One advantage this place has over Naga is the fact that their portions are bigger so you get more bang for your buck.   I would definitely come back here if I am craving Thai food since I had such a good experience. The staff is nice and attentive since they kept refilling our waters without having to call them over. The prices aren't bad and are worth it because of the quality and quantity.   Check this place out if you get a chance! I will keep you guys updated when I decide to go back here.",

I called to let them know and they informed me they'd resolve it by refunding me the money,  but I never got it.   The orange chicken was not good. The chicken was thinly sliced and battered but not saucy or crunchy. It could be because I had it delivered so it had time to get soggy. The chicken is fried and served with a side of orangey dipping sauce.  Not great.    I do plan on ordering from there again because it's convenient and I believed in giving a place more than one chance. Hopefully the next one will be better",

I ordered papaya salad and spicy basil. Thinking it would be chopped Thai basil but it wasn't. Either way it it was delicious, flavorful and spice level was on point!

When we come here, we can always count on the following: Great options, delicious (and large) Thai tea, CLEAN environment and great service.   You never have to wonder where your servers are, as they are politely attentive. As for the food, the quality of the meat is important to me and they meet my standards! No rubbery-ness that you find at some other Asian restaurants.  We have tried most of their curries, and many of their noodle dishes, but the pineapple/shrimp curry (if I'm not mistaken) is my favorite.  Also, they deliver and it's just as good at home!  I would say this place isn't good for groups larger than 6, as the setting is a little more intimate so space would be an issue. Great date night place, though!",

Although the restaurant is on the small side, it's nicely decorated with comfortable seats. I remember seeing 2 or 3 TVs. We were given water right away. We decided to go with the orange chicken lunch special ($8) pad Thai lunch special ($7) and pad see ew ($10) because we thought the lunch special portions would be small.   They started us off with a small bowl of vegetable soup that had one wonton in it. The meat was pretty tough so I didn't really care for it but the broth was flavorful and sweet... ( I'm hoping there isn't a bunch of msg in there). My friend really liked their soup.  Our food came our quickly and the orange chicken portion was pretty big. The pad Thai portion size was smaller and the pad see ew portion size looked ok, but we were too stuffed to finish anything. The spiciness level in both noodle dishes were supposed to be at a 2 (out of 5) but I felt that that pad Thai was more of like a 3.5. I had to pick out a bunch of (fresh) chili pieces out. Also, the color of the noodles seemed to be very... orange. I wasn't a huge fan of the pad Thai. However, the pad see ew was delicious! Best pad see ew I have ever had. It was perfectly seasoned with a hint of sweetness. Also, the beef was super tender. My friend enjoyed her orange chicken and also really liked the pad see ew. Next time we come back, we will be ordering pad see ew again.   Service was great. Our waters were constantly being refilled and we didn't feel rushed to finish our meal before their closing time at 3.",

Upon arrival the food was still warm as if it had come straight from the kitchen onto my dinner table. The driver was very nice and even gave me some free thai iced tea for ordering delivery.   Food:  - The first thing i got was a yellow curry. For the price it was a bit small portioned but really satisfied my hunger. The sauce was excellent and had a bit of a kick to it (i got a medium) and had a VERY generous amount of meat in it. The flavor was excellent as well as the consistency; not too runny, not to thick. This came with your choice of white or brown rice.   -Second, I ordered the pad thai. Once again this was on a scale from not spicy-spicy. I got a medium but the flavor was not spicy at all. Anyways, the noodle were very flavorful and all around good. They came with chicken, bean sprouts, green onion, egg, a lemon, and peanut topping.    -Thai Iced Coffee. Enough said. It was absolutely amazing.   -Thai Iced Tea: Simply amazing. Wow.  Overall, this was the best delivery thai I've had. 5/5 would order from here again.",

    "text": "This was a pleasant surprise. I was on my way next door for coffee (*rise) and as I parked I thought, I'll just have a late lunch (2:30). From the outside, this place is much understated and truly unimpressive but as you enter, you immediately realize the owner put a lot of thought into making this place comfortably chic and more upscale than most Thai restaurants.  The venue is well lit, large windows with enough tinting to make it very comfortable and clean. I cannot emphasize enough how clean the place looks.    Lunch pricing is lower than average at a great value of $7-9!!  This is only reinforced by the more than reasonable portion size.  This place reeks of great value, at least for lunch.  Considering this is my first visit and my first review of this restaurant, food-wise I would only read into this \"lightly\" until a couple more visits.  The food came out within 3-4 minutes of my order. Therefore, on the onset, service is awesome, the kitchen fast (perhaps too fast--I'll explain later), the staff very engaging and attentive; giving you enough space so as not to crowd the guest and are \"invisible\" in a positive way.  They filled my beverage (tea/water) without notice.  The disappointment - this is the gist of it. After all we go to restaurants to eat.  Therefore, if the food isn't what stands out over the ambiance, then the place is just, okay.  The brown rice was sticky and pasty; a clear sign that it was past its time in the rice cooker.  My order was as basic as it can be for a first time visit--Broccoli Chicken.  As I mentioned earlier the portion size was generous, at least 8-ounces (easily 5 oz of chicken).  The chicken was cooked well.  The vegetables, soft and over cooked.  The flavors over all were spot on; sauce was delicious.  Here is what I suspect they do in the kitchen: the base -- veggies and broth sit in a pot. They flash cook the meats (chicken, beef, pork or shrimp) per order and throw that into the base at plating.  This unfortunately makes the cooking unbalanced.  Say what you would about the P** W** chain but, theirs is cooked to order.  All of it, to order, each time.  Therefore, the veggies are not soggy and it only takes 3-4 minutes more.  I don't think anyone would balk if the kitchen takes 10-minutes to put out your lunch order. After all you can pass the time with the soup that comes with the meal anyway.  Also, the salad greens were Iceberg lettuce instead of a leafy mixed green which has more nutritional value but hey, it is under $8!! This place would better serve their customers if they par-cook the veggies or just keep the stock separately and compose the ingredients upon each order.  I'll give this place another couple of tries for dinner and perhaps with a larger group to experience it on a better day.  Every establishment is entitled to a bad day.",

Orange Chicken: Sauce was extremely delicious, had little bits of orange peels in it and great flavor. The chicken pieces were extremely sub par though. It was deep fried and breaded- but I couldn't taste any chicken whatsoever. Only a couple bits had even a noticeable piece of chicken in it. After about 5 bites the novelty of the great sauce wore off and I realized I was just eating deep fried bread with orange sauce.   Sweet & Sour Chicken: Ordered in order to take to lunch the next day. Same deal as the orange chicken. Extremely small to non existent chicken deep fried in too much breading. I ended up just throwing it away because of how unappetizing it looked after the orange chicken.  I recommend staying away from these two options as they are $10-12 and have little to no chicken in them. Very disappointing.",

Service was very pleasant and prompt as well. Now the kicker is that halfway through our meal the electricity for the whole block went out ad the staff came up within minutes with candles to provide light on the table and nearly every staff member came to apologize even though it was clearly not their fault.  Then when I discovered I had insufficient cash (since their credit card reader was not working on account of the electricity being out) they said we could just pay next time we came!  I insisted on leaving my credit card numbers so they could charge for the bill.  Even though the power went out we still had quite a nice meal (although we were definitely liking the music they had playing).  We will definitely be coming back to try some of their other dishes.",

    "text": "My partner and I wanted Thai takeout for dinner and thought this one was the best we've tried so far in our area. We live about 10 minutes away and always pass by. We ordered the pad Thai (level 7) and mixed veggies with shrimp in brown sauce.  The pad Thai was good, but it was a serious 7 and almost too hot for my taste buds so somewhat hard to eat.  The mixed veggies & brown sauce was delicious and something I'd definitely order again. Our food was ready before our initial pick up time also so that was a plus since we arrived early!  If I'm craving Thai again this will be the spot but I'll be sure to take my spice level down a notch!",

    "text": "I have been here twice now and have not been \"wow'd\" either time.  My first impression was that the food was just mediocre, the restaurant isn't very comfortable feeling, and the service was very awkward (the waitress stands to one side of the room and just stares at you to see when she should come back to your table).  That first visit was well over six months ago, so today I decided to give it another shot. I went in for lunch and there was only one other party in the restaurant.  A woman waved to seat me but I was not able to understand what she said so another lady came out and seated me.  This is a very sensitive topic, but I feel that you should not have people in a position to take orders for food if there is that strong of a language barrier. Mind you, English is my second language so I am not trying to sound rude to English learners in the least. I just think it's not right (to the employee or the customer) to have somebody in a position where they really need to be able to understand, and yet they cannot take an order or have a basic exchange in English. Example- The other table that was seated asked for an iced tea. The lady kept asking \"hot iced tea?\". To which the gentleman at the other table tried not to seem rude as they were explaining they just wanted iced tea. Again, someone that spoke better English had to come out and get the order.  Today I ordered vegan pad Thai. But honestly, it was more like stirfried glass noodles with some veggies added. It was OK, but not what I had ordered. And the salad that came with was room temp. Room temp lettuce is not appetizing.  Then of course there was the girl that was circling me and took my plate and napkin away before I was really done.  I've seen the other reviews on here where people rave about how good the food is. I have had plenty of Thai food in my life and I cannot rave about either of the two visits I have had at this restaurant.  I don't think I will return -as today's visit cemented my first impression.",

I ordered the penang soft shell crab lunch special and the BBQ pork plate. The crab penang sauce had too much peanuts for me, but it was good.

Fantastic food, good portion sizes, and fair prices for the quality.  -The cucumber salad was awesome, fresh and came with lots of onion, carrot, and pepper. Not too sweet but instead just good spicy flavor. -They gave me a complementary seaweed salad that was great. Peanuts onions and more. If not on the menu yet you should ask for it. -My pineapple tofu red curry was one of the best I've ever had. Full of flavor with onions, pepper, basil, bay leaves. You can add the complementary little chili flakes, chili paste, and jalapeno for a major kick. It didn't need the add-ons, I took a few sips of the broth and nibbled through it I wanted to enjoy each drop.   Great service! Patty is a legend! I was greeted, seated, and brought water quick. Got my very good and large ice tea fast which comes in a glass mason jar. I was already stoked at this point.  The kind server asked if I had been there before, I said no, and she was actually happy to offer suggestions and go over the menu. She asked what I liked with a genuine smile on her face the whole time and you could tell she cared. Many customers got hugs when arriving and she got told I love you from several people! Haha.   I'm so happy this place is by my new house and can't wait to try more things. I'll be back often for sure. If you are not close just make the trip and check them out.   I appreciate Patty and the yelp community for helping me find this place. Thanks and enjoy!",

When you select that item it prompts you to pick a protein... shrimp being $3 we assumed that meant extra shrimp was $3 since the description already included shrimp.  So  we chose the chicken which was free. Food arrives, no shrimp in the dish. Called the restaurant and they said if we wanted shrimp, we were supposed to select it and pay $3 extra..... on a dish called asparagus shrimp, in the description it lists shrimp as one of the ingredients. They refused to rectify the situation And will only bring a shrimp dish if we pay extra, and then blamed postmates. That is just not an acceptable way to treat customers and after years of ordering there, will never order there again.",

How convenient is that, my card is already attached and I can check my order status right there in the app.   Love the menu selection, vegan options were available. Spicy level 1-5 on most dishes. They were accommodating with editing my order and omitting things we don't like.   The food was fabulous!  Really hit the spot. We ordered crab fried rice, pad Thai with ground pork and a small Tom yum soup. With delivery fees it's was around $45. The servings were quite large. There were huge chucks of crab in the rice and it wasn't imitation. Pad Thai was very flavorful and lots of ground pork. Tom yum soup was my favorite out of the order. 3/5 spicy was the perfect amount. It had So much chicken and mushrooms. The broth was infused with lemongrass like usual but it was stronger than normal which I love.",

My favorite Thai dish is yellow curry. Wow it's just so good here, perfect thickness of the sauce and the most fresh ingredients.

I have a rule with thai places your either a pad thai or a curry very few do exceptional at both dishes. I decided to go with the pad thai thai for $12. At first glance i thought this is not going to be enough food and i came hungry! but to my surprise it was very filling. I got a spice level 2 and it suprisingly had more of a kick then j expected but, it was just right for me. It had both chicken and shrimp which is a nice bonus, although i only got 2 shrimps and few bits of chicken. my overall thought was that it was good. something is missing i can't quite put my finger on it but overall i would come again.",

ATMOSPHERE: The restaurant has this vintage vibe to it that makes it great to go out for a date or meet up some friends for dinner. The restaurant is pretty small so there are times that you have to wait. I suggest calling ahead to make a reservation. The seem to do a lot of togo orders because there are constantly people walking in and out of the restaurant.

Yesterday during lunch it was busy so the three of us lunch gals got a big table and ordered promptly. 2 orders came out with about a 5 minute delay for the third order, not nice since being polite is waiting until all three of us can eat. After we were finished our plates were cleared and we waited a very long time for our check, we actually had to wave someone down despite the rush being gone. Typically it wouldn't be a big deal but a lunch rush is just that because people have to get back to work.   The time before that, I was also on lunch with a different friend and I laid with cash. The lady brought my payment back AND the change so I made money for eating there. Of course I have the money back and told her but there wasn't much appreciation. Perhaps they need to have more staff during lunch due to the recent issues. One thing is always consistent.....the food! It's always great but service is huge and it seems to be going downhill. :(  Excellent pad Thai, spice level 3 was just enough to make my nose run but not enough hurt my stomach. The presentation was lovely, the service was perfect and I look forward to coming back on another lunch break in the near future. My coworker loved his beef salad with added shrimp as well.",

The freshly ripe  mangoes with cherry on top compliments the authentic Thai dessert . I thought the good was great and affordable . Patty provided excellent service and great recommendations on the menu.",

I loved the pad see ew the most! The lunch special sizes were of a good proportion, the soup tasted like  vegetable water. Get lunch special for the price not for the side soup.  They were quick to give us to go boxes and let us each walk up to the register and pay individually (they would not give us separate checks).  My only other problem with Table Thai was how thirsty I was after the meal!  Also, no hard alcohol. Limited number of beers and wines. ALSO, turn up your AC!!! We were burning up in there!",

For a veggie lover, I recommend the basic mixed veggie plate. So simple but I bet if I tried to make it at home it wouldn't come out nearly the same. They also deliver which makes my life easier.",

The restaurant also offers brown rice and variety options for health lovers! Final order is Mango sticky rice; it is so delicious 5/5!!  The service are exceptional, fast 5/5 and friendly 5/5.

I came here with my dad one afternoon for an early dinner and the food was so bland, it felt like the greatest waste of money I've ever spent on Thai food. Granted, my family is Thai so we are more on the critical end of the spectrum.   Firstly, when I spoke to the waitress in Thai confirming whether their yellow curry noodles was \"khao soi\", she said it was so I believed her and ordered it, since it is one of my favorite dishes. My dad ordered pad see ew since that is how he judges a restaurant on how good this simple-to-make dish is. When my noodles came out, you better believe I was disappointed. The curry was too light and bland, with vegetables that did not belong in there and the noodles were almost like ramen noodles, not khao soi noodles. My dad's order was tasteless, missing key components of a proper pad see ew, like garlic and Chinese broccoli. I can let go of the Chinese broccoli because it can be hard to find depending where you live, but how do you forget garlic in a Thai stir fry dish?! Oh, I almost forgot, the noodles in the pad see ew were old too because they weren't soft as should be. Overall, this place was a huge disappointment and severely overpriced for the quality of food. Never coming here again and telling all my friends to steer clear of this place as well.   One added star for decor and nice tableware.",

She seems to thrive on serving and making everyone happy. She was zipping around from table to table, and I wish I knew what vitamins she took (ha ha).   Being my first time here and assuming they would get the order to the right table, I didn't pay attention (my fault) to what I was served, although a different server announced what it was as she brought it to the table. When I asked after a few scrumptuous bites if a spicy shrimp salad came with the salmon I had ordered, it was discovered that it belonged to the nice couple at the next table. I was told to keep the salad anyway no charge. Patty made sure the couple got extras to compensate for the wait, and the wife told me that Patty is always like that. When I had to have my leftovers boxed, Patty gave me fresh rice and a yummy, and as she pointed out, healthy Thai Tea to replace the regular iced tea I didn't get to finish. My order of Garlic Salmon was so yummy I will order it again (if you don't mind it being sweet, try it.) But I also want to try other items on their menu. This place is a little out of the way for me, but, believe me, I will make it \"on the way!\" Also, they offer brown rice!",

The food is amazing and you'll enjoy all of the normal staples that most people learn to love when it comes to Thai food.  We elected to have our wedding rehearsal dinner here and let me tell you, that was an amazing event.  The owner and staff went out of their way to host a wonderful multi-course meal all while having a very fresh atmosphere that all of our guests really enjoyed.  We were able to order a bunch of different menu items that many folks had never tried before.  Not only was the event a lot of fun, but the resturant has opened our eyes to many other Thai dishes that we might not have tried in other places.  Our family continually returns to a thoughtful staff that serves great food.  Give this place a shot and try the Larb!",

The staff is very kind and gives great service. The food was good too.  Tonight, however, I ordered the crab rangoon, beef salad, and pad Thai. The crab rangoon was good, always one of my favorite dishes to eat. The beef salad was too sour. Almost too sour that I couldn't eat it, when I love to eat sour! The beef on the salad was so tough! The pad Thai was overly sweet and the chicken in it was also very tough. I did not enjoy my meal at all and neither did my boyfriend. I'm pretty disappointed in the quality of the food. I don't think I could come back after this visit, which makes me sad because I like the atmosphere and the service.",

This was honestly one of the best chicken curries I have ever had, it was so flavorful. I also ordered a Thai tea that was really good, I love Thai tea and could not resist.

Had the usual Thai food; yellow curry, chicken pad Thai, fried rice, but something new...calamari and their crepe cake. Really, I just saw their crepe cake on Yelp and had to try it out! Each meal was very tastey! Be sure to add spice to it if you want some kick! Calamari was just right and their cake was delish! Wished I ordered ice cream on the side. Service was good, could use more than just one server. Seemed like the lady was running around doing everything from answering the phone, greeting, taking orders, serving and cleaning. She was very nice though. Ambiance was great! Clean and a nice zen feeling. Only draw back was they served the appetizer after our entrees came out. That's just a no no. But, I would come back for more!",

This last time my husband ordered two different dishes which usually come with shrimp to be made without shrimp. It was clearly stated on each item. No shrimp.  Veggies only.   Guess what gets delivered? Shrimp. So of course now there is no rating the food and he has nothing for dinner after waiting an hour    Additionally, I ordered a new dish this order myself, but kept it in the fridge and had it the next night for dinner. and have been ill all morning /afternoon following. I can't say for certain that it's related, as no one else ate it. But I didn't have anything else different during the day that I can associate this with.   I will say their food is delicious. But their following directions leaves much to be desired.  If you are planning to eat here, it seems you need to go there in person as they do not follow instructions when it comes to delivery.    I hope they can improve their delivery customer service as their food is good and it sounds like a cute place to visit. I like to support small locally owned businesses. But customer service is key.  They need to improve that area.",

It tasted like peanut butter and was absolutely not spicy at all. Yes, I know panang is supposed to have a peanut flavor, but this dish was overkill to the point of being kinda gross.   Perhaps the chef was having an off day, because I heard the girl sitting next to me complain about her yellow curry being thin and flavorless. With so many good reviews, I'd be willing to try again. However if I have another experience like my last, I would never return.",

Everyone working was nice and I felt they truly care about their customers. Always asking and checking up on us to make sure things were okay. Anyways, our waitress greeted us as we came in and directed us to our table. We ordered three dishes: The Duck Roll, the Drunken Noodles with Beef, and Tom Yum soup with Shrimp plus our drinks: Thai Iced Tea.   Out of the the three plates, I thought the Drunken Noodles was the best because the noodles weren't too soft or hard. The noodles were cooked at the right amount and had a bite to it. The sauce wasn't too salty or sweet; however, the overall dish was a bit oily (but that's most of the case with a stir-fried Asian dish). The portion was sufficient enough for one person.   The Tom Yum Soup was good, but there wasn't anything special about it. Plus the portion was a bit small for what I thought was a large size. I'm not sure if the waitress misheard me, but I was surprised if that was what they call a \"large\". By the way, since we called for shrimp, it was a $3 extra cost. However, the soup was well seasoned, not too sour with just the right amount of sweetness. Other than that, it only had the broth, mushrooms, and shrimp.   Lastly were the Duck spring rolls. This was a bit disappointing. There weren't much duck meat, but rather more veggies instead. The dipping sauce it came with was good, but again nothing too exciting with this appetizer.   I like the Thai Iced Tea. It came out in a Mason jar mug and was a lot. There are some Thai restaurants that can be very cheap with the portion of Thai Tea given. Many even water it down or put a lot of ice to make it seem like you're drinking a lot, but you really arent. This place DOES NOT do that. So for $3, I thought it was reasonable. The drink was a bit too sweet for my taste, so next time I'll just let them know to lessen the sweetness. :)",

Thus, when our appetizer ( we ordered a sampler) and 3 entrees arrived ( Phad Thai, Panang curry, BBQ Chicken and Cat Fish) we don't have a space !!! Again, I requested for a bigger table and that's the only time  the waitress who was talking Thai to the other cashier accommodated our request. Irked with the waitress attitude and vapid taste of their food except for the panang, we left not barely touching their Phad Thai. I have my doubts why this restaurant won the Best of LV Thai Restaurant. Thai BBQ and Lotus of Siam remained to be my top two Thai places to go to. Live and learn ... I guess.",

Their service was great, restaurant is beautiful, and service was fantastic.  Immediately after we got our food, employees were constantly checking in with us and keeping our drinks filled.

They have a great selection of food and most can be made vegetarian/vegan. The food was incredibly fresh and jam packed full of flavor. We ordered our food at a spice level 3 which was great for me but a little on the spicy side for my boyfriend, so if you can't take the heat I would order a level 1 or 2. This is definitely a place I would go back to when I'm in the Henderson area!",

The atmosphere was relaxed and the decor was modern and clean. I was the only patron around 9:30pm on a weeknight and the staff was respectful and attentive.   Here's what I tried: *Small chicken, shrimp and wonton soup, $6.00: really tasty but sliiiiiiightly too salty. Good enough to order again.  *Red curry with shrimp and (sweet potatoes?), level 5 spicy, $15:00: Really tasty with fresh ingredients. They made it \"very spicy\" as I requested, and still managed to keep it super flavorful.  I'd love to dine here again and try other dishes. Totally recommend!",

Since I was still enjoying some quality time at the cafe I opted to order take-out directly through the Yelp app. YASSSSSSSS. Big win.  I opted for the Panang Curry with tofu which was my favorite dish. I'm honestly not sure why I went with tofu and not chicken but I loved the dish. The tofu was firm but creamy and the curry was rich with a hint of spice at 2 stars. I wasn't so much a fan of the Phad Thai and that's okay.   The order was ready for me when I walked in and the space was super cute. I'd totally love dining in but I'm in love with ordering takeout.",

For the brief time I entered the restaurant, the staff was nice and friendly. As far as the food goes, it was amazing. I specifically had the tofu pad thai and I couldn't have asked for it to taste better. The noodles were perfectly chewy and it wasn't fishy like a lot of places offer. The portion size was quite large as well. Overall I would eat here again.",

We started reading the menu outside on the sidewalk, and the waitress popped her head out to make sure we didn't have any questions. We noticed they had many vegan options, so we went inside. The inside is very nice and cozy, with a romantic ambience and very clean. Perfect for a date night. The waitress was very nice. I ordered the vegan orange tofu, which was wonderfully presented. Portion size was bigger than I expected for the lunch price, and came with rice, side salad, and a broth soup with veggies. The orange tofu was delicious. Actually, everything was. Our waitress checked on us often, and gave us recommendations for vegan entrees to try next. We will definitely be back.",

We ordered a family size soup- simply yummy considering the weather outside was freezing; drunken noodles, papaya salad, spring rolls. Everything was really yum! Since we had a little more appetite we asked Anna to recommend something additional- she recommended the basil spaghetti but we wanted it with rice noodles instead. So requested that the chef get creative with rice noodles, basil and whatever else- the result was simply superb. Definitely recommend this and we plan to come back",

    "text": "To start off I'll say that once I pulled up into the parking lot, the exterior of the restaurant already caught my attention. Stepping foot into Table Thai Bar & Bistro amazed me, the interior of the restaurant was an outstanding sight. It looked very modern and the decor and furniture tied in with the modern culture of today's society. When the waitress greeted us, she was very polite and our first impression of her already gave us the perception of great customer service. Our first dish was an appetizer, Shumai and Papaya Salad. It was very fresh and delightful. Our second dish was an entree, Grilled Lamb Panang. The lamb being cooked medium, made the meat very tender and moist. The panang sauce matched very well with the exquisite meat. Afterwards, we enjoyed the Deep Fried Fish with Red Chili Sauce. We thought everything was amazing but this dish caused me to be ecstatic. The flavors were so splendid and went together so strongly. The deep fried fish was boneless and the sauce was not too spicy; the basil had a strong dominant taste that tied everything together. Last, but not least, don't forget to order their homemade Thai Tea. The sweetness was perfected and the tea was very delicate, but bold. Unfortunately, we did not order dessert due to all the delicious food we had eaten, but hopefully you try their desserts because I don't doubt that it isn't as amazing as everything else. I could doubtlessly say that everything from their presentation to the actual meal, was stunning. Overall, I savored every bite on my plate and every sip being drank. I could easily say that I will definitely be back to Table Thai Bar & Bistro very soon.",

My husband and I ordered the yellow curry, garlic lamb chops, lazy duck, and mango sticky rice with thai tea to drink. The overall food portions were ridiculously small and over priced for okay flavor. The yellow curry chicken was the most flavorful dish with some spice but every other dish was bland and lacking. The duck needed sauce. The garlic lamb chops were tough and in need of spices. The thai teas were (in my opinion) way too sweet but when the ice melted down they were good to go.   All in all, I will only ever order desert and beverages from Thai Table and nothing more. I will not visit here or recommend it to anyone for a meal.  I honestly tried to give this little joint the benefit of the doubt and encourage you to do the same if money is no object and unflavored food in tiny portions is your deal. Your luck here is probably gonna be better than ours was if this is the case.",

The papaya salad tasted like it was tossed in that sweet chili sauce, Too sweet for my taste buds. Fresh ingredients but just wasn't executed like a papaya salad I prefer 3/5.  Pad Thai noodles was slathered in a wet red sweet sauce 2.5/5. (Strange that other posted their pad Thai looks different from what I had) Also had side lettuce with a sweet thick dressing, didn't eat the salad.   Overall this place was busy during lunch time and had REALLY good service. Food wasn't awful but just not \"my\" typical Thai lunch spot and everything tastes too sweet IMO. Maybe try some other dishes next time just not those items.",

It took my boyfriend and I some serious convincing that the Orange Soy Chicken was indeed vegan because it tasted so real. So, so good.  Most places that substitute their main dishes with a fake meat alternative usually ends up too dry. Not here, they're fake meat is unreal. (No pun intended) Even adding soy chicken in with the yellow curry is really good, too. It's expensive, but you get what you pay for in my opinion. I never leave feeling like I didn't get enough to eat. I could drink 45 of their Thai Ice Tea's in one sitting.  And the garlic fried rice...I've legitimately had dreams about it. Don't ever ever ever leave here without having tried their freaking garlic fried rice.  Overall, the food is fantastic.   But the best thing about this place is the staff and the atmosphere. I would go in here everyday after work and they ladies that work here became some of my very dear friends. I never left the place without a hug and without having some good laughs.

I was also quite surprised by the roses that were made for the straws! I didn't have the heart to throw them away or crush them so I ended up keeping them :) Idk if that was just for V-Day but I was so taken away someone took the time to decorate them before they hit the table!   Food: We ordered Steamed Gyoza for an appetizer and it came out very professional looking and looked like someone actually cared about their food! A+ As far as an entree order we got the Pad See Ew with shrimp and the BBQ Chicken. Both had really good flavor and overall we had a really pleasant lunch. We didn't feel bombarded by the staff and was able to enjoy a great lunch together.   Definitely would come back again to try the other dishes like the curry! :)",

The many postmates that kept picking up food was just the validation we needed that this place was awesome! Normally I opt for a shrimp thick noodle plate but I decided to try the spice herb catfish on the chef's recommendation page of the menu. It was amazing! And for spice level 3/5 it had a kick!!  Bathrooms are super clean too, and the staff is very friendly.  Now I found my new thai place & I'm so happy!!",

It's such a poppin' lunch spot that I feel like if you don't get there early, you might be waiting a bit for a table, or sadly, have to leave (there's not a lot of space to wait).   I frequent this spot especially during lunchtime. They have a really great lunch special that isn't terrible expensive. They also serve every special with soup and rice. Their fried rice is scrumptious and full of flavor. Their soup - man, so dang good! I am not the most adventurous eater so I always opt for the teriyaki chicken, which I've never been disappointed in.  On top of the delicious food, the staff is always quite kind. I've never had a bad experience with any staff here. The ambiance is also quite beautiful with dark wood decor. It's extremely clean and beautiful inside.  Now that I think about it, I know what I'll be getting for lunch tomorrow....",

We also got some spring rolls (fried) and the sauce that came with it, made them even better then we thought. I ended up getting the pad Thai, the usual when I try new places.. it wasn't that great. There was no flavor, barely any taste of peanuts in it and lack of veggies. I expected more, didn't get that.  Also the waitress was nice but didn't come around a lot, she looked like the only one taking orders. Place was busy too, would of liked to see more people waiting on customers.",

I know my spicy level is over the top, so I'm not rating on their spiciness. fresh and good tofu and mushrooms--tom yum soup was hot and serve on the fancy hot stove so it was boiling while we ate with our noodles/rice.   however, customer service was lacking. after we sat down, it took about like five minutes to come back to our table to take orders for two (and that one night, it was only us two plus two girls at other table, so it was not a busy night at all). after ordering, it seems like it took forever for our foods to come out. good thing our tom yum soup boils as we eat. I don't know why but we were ignored the whole entire time we were there. I tried to get the young gal attention cause she likes to walk back and forward across the bar/center and stop after the fact I saw that she doesn't care about our table. I can see that she was quite busy with the phone calls in between work and her cell phone. there was two Postmates orders that came out and out. also, one walk in for take out.  I want to try their Thai tea crepe cake for desserts afterward finishing our meal, but decided not to.   we just sat there and talked for awhile. no refills and didn't bother checking if we needed anything else or get the check. nada. it was exhausted night for us too so we didn't care much.   we won't be coming back, the vibe wasn't right. the foods was just average--nothing that stands out and nothing that I would come back for.",

We originally had reservations but when we got there, open tables were available for us to get seated right away. Atmosphere is very cozy and relaxed. Some tables were placed very close together!  My go-to thai dishes are pad see ew and a curry. We started with the appetizer sampler, which had pieces of chicken satay, shu Mai, spring rolls and coconut shrimp. Everything was delicious... but what doesn't good when it's fried?  We ordered the pad see eww with tofu and jade curry with chicken. Both dishes we had a spice level of 3. The spice kicks in after you really start digging in to the dish, but it was sooo good to not resist eating. The noodles in the pad see eww was very tender and thin enough to soak up yummy sauce. The chicken also thinly sliced and ask very tender and juicy. I chose the jade curry because I love eggplant, which I wish had more of! Either way, we devoured all of it.   Thai tea crepe cake was amaaaazing. The Thai tea wasn't too overpowering, which is probably why I ended up eating the whole piece to myself :)   Service was exceptionally fast and friendly. Our server gave us free white rice and offered again after we had finished our meal. She's so sweet. One thing I wish they had was more bathroom stalls. Regardless, I'll definitely be back again.",

    "text": "Overall: Table Thai has decent food, but some basic dishes fell very short of expectations.  Food: 3  Jade Fried Rice with Chicken: The flavor was good but the execution was lacking. The dish lacked the signature wok taste of good fried rice. In fact, there was no char on the chicken and the rice tasted almost like white rice mixed with curry paste in minimal low heat.  Drunken Noodle with Beef: Pretty tasty dish. We got a spice level of 2/5. This was enough for a spice wimp like me to feel the heat, but this will taste like nothing for seasoned eaters.  Service: 4  The waitress was nice and patient with our large group. Note that they will only take up to 5 credit cards.  Ambiance: 4  The restaurant has really nice decor, but the metal frame of the windows and AC units are jarring against the otherwise fairly elegant design. It's like a \"high-end\" Thai restaurant was shoved into an old fast food store front.",

We chose Table Thai Bar & Bistro and had a great meal.  The food was great and the service was amazing.    We ordered the crab rangoon as an appetizer which was a great start to our meal.  These were not frozen appetizers that were thrown in a fryer, they were light, crispy and the filling was very flavorful.   For our meal, we ordered Drunken Noodles with pork and the Sea Curry.  The Sea Curry was a red curry based dish that was served with great vegetables like carrots, bell peppers, bamboo shoots, and onion which accompanied the shrimp, calamari, white fish and mussels. The portion was large and while we ate all the seafood we were not able to finish all the curry.    The Drunken Noodles were classic and full of flavor.  The pork was tender and delicious.  I have had a lot of druken noodles in my life and these were first class.  If you are looking for great food, a pleasant atmosphere, and great service and want to avoid the crazy spots in town then this is a great place to enjoy a great meal.",

Our server was very attentive and friendly.   We ordered the combo appetizer, pineapple shrimp curry, garlic green beans with chicken, crab fried rice, and the mango with sticky rice to finished. Plus, one Thai ice tea and Thai ice coffee. The combo appetizer is a good option for three people to share as it includes a little bit of everything.   My favorite among the plate was the egg roll and the coconut shrimp. The chicken satay came with a peanut sauce that I really enjoyed. The pineapple shrimp curry was amazing. The curry had so many layers of flavor and was mildly spicy. It was a thinner consistency, similar to a broth. It came with huge pieces of shrimp and loaded with pineapples and veggies. My favorite dish was the garlic green beans with chicken. It was savory but sweet and the fried garlic pieces added nice texture and fragrance to the dish. The chicken to green beans ratio was perfect and it came with a side of white rice which was much needed to soak up all that delicious sauce! The crab fried rice was another winner! There was huge chunks of crab meat in the rice along with some vegetables. It was definitely enough for 2-3 people to share as well! Portions here are definitely very reasonable for the price.   Last but not least, the mango with coconut sticky rice was the perfect dessert to top everything off! The mango was juicy and beautifully presented. The sticky rice wasn't too sweet but just enough to counteract the slight sourness in the mango. I definitely recommend ordering this desert when it is available.   Overall, we had an amazing experience. This place is about 15 mins from the strip but they do offer delivery as well!",

The Chicken Satay was pretty bland, and the peanut sauce wasn't as creamy as I normally see at other restaurants. It was very oily and the ingredients were separating in the container. I had to stir it up before every bite.  The Fresh Roll with Shrimp was very messy and hard to eat. It was falling apart more and more with every bite. The rice paper was ripping before I even picked it up.   The Beef Pho did not have the traditional thin Vermicelli noodles that I was expecting. Instead the noodles were wider and flatter, and the broth had a sweet taste to it.   Like I said, the food wasn't terrible, it just wasn't what I was expecting and didn't really satisfy my craving.",

Being from the San Francisco Bay Area, where ethnic food is the norm and coming from an extensive food background, we're discerning eaters.  This place has all the key things you need to be happy, eat well, not break the bank and enjoy a good time with your special someone or any friend.  Lipi gave us the friendly, royal treatment and a discount for me on Mother's Day.  We tried the Chef's recommendation for Thai sausage with varied accoutrements, which was some of the most delicious sausage (and I am not a sausage person).  The casing was so thin, the flavors meld.  Next came our small bowl of flavorful Tom Yum and you need to order it to taste it and enjoy the presentation.  For an entree we got the Lazy Duck, and honestly, the portion compared to other Thai places is generous and stunning.  From the minute we arrived, the ambiance, the warm friendly service was apparent.  We plan to go back, maybe, tonight and often.  I rarely post YELP reviews, but Thai Table and their staff, deserve a rave review...  Oh, sidenote, got the biggest Thai iced tea served in a huge mason jar mug and BF had our fav beer to pair with Thai food, Chang.",

We even asked for separate checks and they were fine with that.  I was a little upset because two of my group did not show up but the waitress took care of removing a table so it worked. I will go again and take my husband next time.",

I usually give people the benefit of the doubt, but I will not be giving this place another chance. The food, at best, was mediocre. Maybe I didn't get their specialties. But that wasn't the main issue. I made my order for delivery around 6:00 PM last night. An hour later the delivery lady calls and says she can't find our location. I couldn't understand her because her accent was so bad.  My daughter had to talk to her and finally got her pointed in the right direction. Well over an hour has now passed and she finally gets here with the food. No apologie, the food is cold and she has the gall to blame us for not giving her the right address. What is Google maps for? Needless to say I won't be eating here ever again.",

They told me that because I didn't say no meat, even though it says there's no meat, they add whatever they think for meat and it was my fault for not saying no meat....the description clearly read no meat! Noodle, tomatoes, basil, and spicy garlic sauce! After arguing with them for almost 10 minutes they finally said they would send another order. About 10 minutes went by and they called me back telling me that my order was on the way and they want the other order back! Can you belive that? Who does that?! What are they going to do resell it?

I used to live in SF so Thai food used to be a staple for me, but sometimes it's hard to find a really good place in Vegas.  I would definitely recommend table Thai. The ambiance is nice, it's kind of dark. I got the pad se ew with beef. It was really flavorful, but I found that they added a little too much beef. It was kind of hard for me to eat, a little to chewy. I ended up moving all the beef to the side of my plate, which was 1/3 of the food and just ate the noodles and vegetables in it.   The staff was very friendly. They kept asking us how we liked the food and were very attentive.  I definitely want to come back and try the curry next time!",

Since I was at the coffee shop for a couple hours and it was already lunch time when we left there, decided to stop by and check out this place for their lunch specials.  Lunch plates are offered between 11-4pm and the prices are under $10 for the 18 different entrees listed. Comes with a clear broth soup with a dash of black pepper seasoning. Also choice of steam or brown rice. Nice that they don't up charge you for brown rice!  They had great entree choices but I chose my standby dish; Yellow Curry Tofu to see how it measures up to the other Thai places. Unfortunately it was just okay for me. I was a little bummed out. Oh well.  The seasonings were not present and the curry was weak IMO .  The rice though that accompanied my order was cooked perfectly and I ate that all.  And I normally don't finish my rice!  I am impressed that the lunch portions offered are a pretty good size for lunch meals.  More food than lunch plates offered in other places.  The menu is an interesting read. Thirsty Drink,(for drinks) Sweet Lover(aka desserts), Hot & Warm,( Spicy and Mild I think they meant)  but what's Health & Healthy? I do appreciate the menu is organized into sections which made it easy to read and quick enough to zero in to what you are hungry for.  Even though my order was messed up initially, service here is great! The staff is really nice and my orders came out pretty quickly. I DO look forward to coming back here again. When I have a bigger appetite I want to try out  one one of the duck dishes and some of the Chef Recommendations for dinner.",

The food wasn't bad, but it wasn't special by any stretch of the imagination and for what we paid, that is a disappointment. It was about the same quality and freshness as one of the dozen Thai lunch specials around town for $8 except some of the dishes cost $15+! At these prices we were expecting really tasty, amazing Thai dishes and that just wasn't the case. We ordered a range of items including Yellow Curry, Pad Thai Thai (which was overly sweet), Fried rice, Spicy Basil Noodles, Curry puffs (as appetizer came with 5 pieces...which were very bland for a whopping $9!), and teriyaki chicken. All tasted just fine (except the curry puffs) but were simply overpriced for what we got. For this quality, I will definitely go to a cheaper place next time.",

    "text": "Yet another case of inflated yelp ratings IMHO. I got pad Thai to go with tofu for the lunch special. They initially got my order incorrect but they were quick to fix it and the customer service was great. The spring roll that came with the meal was pretty good, the salad was okay but was drenched with dressing, and I liked how everything was packaged. However, the pad Thai was pretty bad. The entire noodle dish was a strange reddish color (although I got it spicy, it was usual) and I was also wondering why I got a lemon instead of lime with it??? I was really hoping that I'd be able to find good Thai food on this side of town but it looks like the search will continue.   I would however, give them 5 stars for the service. Everyone I interacted with was very friendly, nice, and quick.  Edit- got food poisoning over this. Not pretty.",

    "text": "Whenever I walk toward the entryway of Sunrise Coffee I have a tendency of looking up at the low flying airplanes ready for landing at McCarren International Airport. A couple of weeks ago, for a change I decided to look down where I set eyes on the Table Thai lunch menu. Where the adventurers in the airplanes were about to land this adventurer was about to take off on a flight that carried me to an interesting dining adventure. My dining adventures at Table Thai would be my first. This marks the first time that I have dined in a Thai restaurant solo. This review reflects on my two food adventures in Table Thai this past week.    Both times that I ate here, it was off the lunch menu. Everyday, Table Thai serves a lunch special from 11 AM to 3 PM. The prices range from $7 to $13. The majority of the lunch specials include mixed salad, rice, and wonton soup with a glass of water with ice. I'd order the barbecue chicken on the leading visit then pad thai on the second. Further into this review, I will talk about them in further detail.     Upon walking inside, I was surprised to be surrounded by an upscale interior. I expected a take out environment. A friendly lady, I believe is one an owner, walked me to a table by the open kitchen. We walked on a new brown floor that the lady would joke with a customer that you can dance on it. Forget about wanting to dance, it would be hard to want to leave the comfortable booth seat. First off, the waitress put the glass of water and ice on the table. I ordered a Coke ahead of the meal. The waitress opened a can of Coke that she poured in a glass of ice. I failed to see hot tea on the menu. After she poured the Coke, I ordered the barbecue chicken. There was around a 15 minute delay before the freshly made lunch arrived. I entertained myself with the Internet compliments of the complimentary Sunrise Coffee WiFi next store.       The barbecue chicken lunch plate was 1/4 entree, 1/4 rice, and it seemed 1/2 mixed salad. The barbecue chicken was quality over quantity. I enjoyed every bite to the bone. This chicken would leave a nice aftertaste that is a sign of using quality ingredients. The rice was allright. The brown rice I ordered looked more like white rice. And tasted like white rice. The wonton soup came at the same time as the meal. It featured one wonton, broccoli, and peas. After lunch, I decided to return to try pad thai.      My second visit was a more adventurous lunch. This was the first time that I dined in a Thai restaurant by myself. This is the first time I partook in a meal with only water. And it was one of my leading times eating pad thai. This was more of a genuine Thai restaurant experience than the last. What is a good Thai restaurant experience? According to McDang a well known expert on Thai cuisine, the food must have intricacy; attention to detail; texture; color; taste; good flavor; and the use of ingredients with medicinal benefits. My pad thai met McDang's expectations with the exception of ingredients with medicinal benefits. The pad thai lunch was $7 and included wonton soup, mixed salad, and water. The pad thai occupied 70% of the plate. My protein was chicken. I told the waitress to make this stir-fried rice noodle dish with a 4 out of 5 spiciness. The pad thai was outstanding. I did not feel the 4 out of 5 spicy. Maybe I have a tolerance to spicy food. Regardless I know great food when I taste it.     Based on the two visits, just like the barbecue chicken the experience left me with a nice aftertaste. That means that I might be back. If I return here, I would order the pad thai over the barbecue. It appears that pad thai is one of Table Thai's signature dishes. Then again I might further extend my horizons and try something totally different.",

    "text": "I wanted a quiet meal after a LONG day at work on my feet, and I had a craving for Thai. My usual Thai place in Las Vegas is always super busy and bustling, so I decided to try something new. Table Thai is located a bit off the beaten path, and the area around it seems mostly commercial, so they were pretty quiet for dinner. Just what I wanted!   I was absolutely STARVING, so I ordered pad see ew, extra broccoli, with both chicken and tofu. The portion sizes are huge. Everything was prepared just the way I like it. Crisp veggies, not overcooked. Just the right amount of spice. The tofu was crispy on the outside, and soft on the inside. Good flavor. Tons of noodles. Not too greasy. I tried my best to finish it because it was so good, but I didn't quite manage.   The waitress was sweet, helpful, and attentive without being overbearing. Bathrooms clean. Parking easy. Modern decor. Definitely worth checking out.   I will have to go back just to try out the dessert menu.",

Our drinks are never empty and they are always giving us refills.   I usually get the Pad Thai. Ugh, let me tell you... It's super yummy. You can ask for spicy on the side or have them add it for you. I, personally, like to have it on the side so I can control how spicy my food is. We also get the orange chicken for the kids. I highly recommend it. And their Thai tea is exceptional!   Nothing but good things to say about this place. I would recommend this place for some good, quality Thai food and service!",

However I do love noodles and rice dishes. We ordered the crab fried rice as our appetizer....it's actually a meal but sounded good at the time! It was delicious! I ordered pad see ew for my main.  Best ever, period. Had Thai iced coffee for the first time, so yummy.  Service was exceptional! Can't wait to return.",

    "text": "After reading some good reviews and being recommended by a close friend, I decided to give Table Thai Bar & Bistro a try. I visited in a Sunday afternoon and the restaurant only serves dinner. The parking lot locates in front of the restaurant so just a few walks to the door. The front door is neat and clean with clear business hour on. Exotic decorations such as elephants which are the symbols of Thailand, Thai ladies wearing traditional dresses and some paintings show the culture and landscape of Thailand. The dining room was almost full by the time I arrived, I was surprised that most of the guests were with their families so I would say this is a kids-friendly restaurant or a perfect place to have family gatherings. There is not a full bar in the restaurant since the size of the restaurant is rather small but I noticed there is a long rectangular table in the middle can seat proximately 8-10 guests.   The restaurant only equipped with 2 servers that day so after it opened, guests arrived quite at the same time so we waited a good 10 minutes to get someone to order the food. I order the Lamb Panang curry because it's rare to see Thai restaurant serves lamb rack or lamb chop in curry sauce, compared to Indian cuisine. The presentation was excellent with a pinch of thai spice on the edge, and some lightly fried mint leaves underneath. I smelt coconut milk in the curry and the distinctively gamy smell of lamb. The spicy taste was on point and met my expectation with a slightly salty finish. My taste buds were covered by the pungent curry flavor and a naturally sweet coconut milk came afterwards. The lamb was cooked perfectly medium rare with tender and juicy pink center. A little bit crispy at the edge and the small amount of lamb fat added the unique texture to the dish. Plain asparaguses were not seasoned or added flavors so they can balance the strong flavor created by the curry and lamb. Asparagus itself is crunchy, fresh and sweet, it helped me to cleanse the palate and get rid of the excessive spicy taste. Overall I enjoyed the food that I ordered. This is a restaurant well worth to try and return.",

They have coke in cans, and it bothers me paying $2+ for a can of coke, and the water came warm from the tap with a few ice cubes and a sliver of lemon. The place and food presentation are nice, and most of the servers are nice, but I won't be dining there again. My food was not spicy at all. I had them bring out the little pots caddy thing with the spicy stuff and it mildly helped. When I told the server I did not wish for a box, she grilled me about why not. I plain out told her that it wasn't tasty or spicy. She said,\"oh, ok. Next time, save room for dessert.\" Wow.",

Tasteful modern decor and comfortable chairs told me this was a cut above the usual Thai strip mall venue.  The Tom Yum was easily the best I have had since visiting Bangkok back in the nineties. For an entree, I opted for Garlic Pepper Pork with carrots and onions. It was delicious, and it's mild sweetness cut the fire of the Tom Yum nicely. I'll be back with friends whenever I visit the east side of town.  Excellent, attentive service from my charming hostess as well. Thumbs up on all counts!",

I'm partial to the silver noodles but the pad Thai, the curry, everything...you can't go wrong. When we bring our friends they always come back! The ambiance is so fab too...it's a must!

All of the dishes were UNDERCOOKED , the noodles were chewy and slimey the plate looked like slime on a plate , the \"FRIED RICE\" was soaking in egg and huge pieces of onion, I said soaked because it was too saucy and slippery . The orange chicken was gummy and the batter was undercooked you could see the yellow batter when you took a bite out of it. OVERALL WORST THAI FOOD & to top it off they charged us for it when we didn't even eat it after our first bite .",

It definitely didn't taste like the Pad Thai dishes I've had a other restaurants. If I come here again, I'd probably stick to Pad Sew Ew. My partner got the Massaman Curry, which tasted decent.  As for appetizers, we decided to go with the Duck Rolls again and it was a disappointment. I felt like the veggies this time were a little overpowering compared to the duck meat, so I had to say \"No\" to this dish too. I loved it last time too, so it must have been a bad batch or something.  Service was great still as they constantly checked on us and refilled our waters. For a table of 3, we spent about $42ish with tax and tip. We went during lunch too and were quickly seated within seconds.",

    "text": "After two visits to Table Thai and a couple of lunch deliveries to my office, I feel comfortable saying that it's one of my favorite Thai places in the valley.  Table Thai is located on Sunset between Pecos & Eastern, a couple doors down from Sunrise Coffee.  The interior is surprisingly warm and welcoming for a strip mall spot.  It's not large, about 10-12 tables that get packed during lunchtime.  Some of the tables have plush chairs and benches, some have wooden-like chairs; all are comfortable.  There are also a couple of large TV's mounted on the wall if you want to watch while dining.  Our service has been exceptional thus far. Everyone here is friendly and accommodating.  Our server was refilling our water glasses before they were even half empty, courses came out quickly, and everything was hot and fresh.  My most recent visit: Tom Kha Soup with Shrimp ($12) 5/5 The broth is so complex and delicious that we kept taking 'just one more spoonful' even though we were full.    Green Papaya Salad ($9) 4/5 So fresh and vibrant.  Delicious and a nice palate cleanser.  Spicy Basil with Shrimp ($14) 5/5 I love that their Spicy Basil is comprised of large pieces of vegetables and protein instead of ground up like a lot of Thai restaurants.  I think their 3 out of 5 heat rating was a little too spicy for me (I might be a wimp).  I got a 2 out of 5 when I had it delivered and that was just fine for me!  Pad Thai with Shrimp ($10) 3/5 Tasty, but nothing special.  There are far better choices at Table Thai in my opinion.  Spicy Eggplant with Tofu ($11) 4/5 Very similar to the Spicy Basil with the addition of eggplant.  This one was ordered at a 4 out of 5 heat rating, so I only sampled a piece of eggplant and a couple peppers because it was hot!  But what I did have was very good.  Thai Tea Crepe Cake ($7) I don't want to rate this one because the consistency was gross to me, but the Thai Tea drizzle was delicious.  Everyone else in my group of 5 loved it.",

Wasn't too busy, they have about 12 tables inside a beautifully decorated small restaurant. Nice soft chairs to sit in. They do serve alcohol now, I saw several asian beers available and some sake as well.   Service was excellent. I believe the owner seated me and took my order. Very nice lady. The food was excellent as well, I ordered my standard crab rangoon appetizer, and Pork Pad See Ew. The crab rangoon had a really good orange citrus sauce that looked homemade and not from a jar. Excellent taste!  The pork pad see ew was also delicious, cooked well and the stir fry sauce wasn't too sweet as I've had other places. Complimented the flavors of the pork, noodles, and egg instead of overpowering it. Like I said, it was the best I've had in Vegas and I've eaten at a lot of Thai places.  I'll be back again and again because the food really is good, the menu is fairly extensive with many options including some Japanese and Chinese options.",

Prices for entrees/main courses are pricier than other Thai eateries , but I liked the ambiance and the way they cook the food here - so I didn't mind !  Food-wise , try the Crying Tiger or the Thai chicken bbq - my old-time favorite here is always the pad see ew. Their spice level is from 1 - 5. They have various hot sauces and peppers as well to give your meal that extra kick ! You have to ask for them though since they keep it in the back. They also have excellent dessert. They're the only place I know who serve Thai tea crepe cake , my favorite.  They have a menu for lunch specials from 11 am - 3 pm , cheaper and same portion amount.  Service is always great , the waitress was very kind and always checked on us to make sure we have enough water , (since we were probably sweating our eyes out). One night I was waiting for a to-go order , and one of the ladies gave me a free Thai iced tea while I waited which was very sweet of her :)",

I told everyone I knew to come here. But not any more.  I don't know if it is new management or a new chef, but the food and the service have taken a serious dive. We noticed the change in November and waited until tonight to try again, just in case it was one off night. Nope.  We always ordered the same things: pad see eiw, panang curry, and pineapple fried rice. It used to be the best in town. But now, the panang curry is way too thick and the flavor is off. It used to be so creamy with the perfect balance of seasonings and coconut milk. I can hardly stomach it any more, and the chicken is far different from the thin and juicy slices they used to have. The pad see eiw has come out cold both times with too little sauce and tough beef I can hardly chew. The pineapple fried rice had chunks of balled up rice and no flavor. The spice it totally unpredictable. Consistency is key with any food but mostly when it comes to spice level. You never know what you're going to get.  There used to be one girl working here that was phenomenal. I don't know if she is still with the place, but I haven't seen her. She used to be there every time we came in. It probably would have been better with her here. The new staff is short and seems to try to ignore you. Maybe I'm just holding them to the unfair standard the other girl set...she was really fantastic.  To say I am disappointed is an understatement. I will miss what this place used to be.",

My friend and I love this little gem. They have varieties of milk to accommodate those with restrictions or preferences. I specially love having my thai tea with coconut milk! Yummy. There has not been an item I have not liked so far.

The inside is very nicely decorated, with some of the most comfortable couches/chairs I have ever sat on in a restaurant. The restaurant has a level of elegance that makes you feel like you're eating at a fancy restaurant without being overwhelmingly stuffy or overpriced.   The staff were INCREDIBLY friendly and attentive. My water glass was never even half empty. And they were more than ready to offer suggestions when we were struggling to pick what we wanted to eat because everything on the menu sounded so good.  We ended up ordering the Season Rolls, Tom Kha Soup, Drunken Noodles with Chicken and Massaman Curry. First, let me say how happy I am that a place is finally combining egg/spring rolls with summer rolls on one appetizer. I always want to eat both, and usually have to pick, but the combination is a great idea, and I wish more restaurants did this. The soup was delicious, and a HUGE portion. Not only does your bowl get filled, but the container with extra broth on the side means you get the equivalents of two bowls of soup. The noodles weren't bad, a little too heavy on the onions, but otherwise no complaints. The curry was definitely the star. Awesome blend of spices.   I'd strongly recommend this place, even if you don't live on this side of town, it is worth the drive.",

The interior is very intimate and elegant, with no more than 20 tables throughout the entire restaurant. It is dimly lit and very quiet, perfect to take someone out on a date.  Food:  Thai Tea (4/5): Decent Thai tea, but not the best I've ever had. I'm not sure if it was just my drink, but it tasted a bit watered down.  Jade Curry (3/5): I had ordered the Jade curry with tofu and spicy level 7. I honestly was not impressed. You can order this with either brown or white rice. Though the portions were big, I could not help but notice how watered down and oily-looking it was. After wanting Thai curry for so long, I was left disappointed in my dish. Be careful about spice levels if you do not eat spicy food often. I would recommend no more than a level 5 if you are not used to spice!  Service: Staff was friendly, accommodating, and attentive. Our server was very knowledgeable on the menu and was able to ask all our questions.  With the abundance of Thai restaurants popping up all over the Valley, Table Thai ranks average. I would come back if I was around the area, but next time I crave Thai food I will probably end up giving another establishment a try.",

    "text": "Thai is always great for lunch because of the lunch specials. With that said, this place gets busy with the work lunch crowd. Price point is pretty good at under $10 with common dishes like pad thai and yellow curry ranging from $7-8.   I can't remember the last time I had pad thai, but I have been craving it for awhile. I'm glad I was able to try this place because their pad thai is really flavorful! Is there still a lime shortage? They serve this dish with lemon instead.  The sides that come with the lunch special are salad and won ton soup, which were average.   I sampled the yellow curry, which I was not all that impressed with. It was watered down and oily. Less flavorful than other Thai joints.   Another disappointment was the thai tea crepe cake, which tasted nothing like thai tea. The color was the only thing that looked like thai tea. The texture was nice and overall a very light and not too sweet of a dessert.   The interior is clean and modern with lots of natural light. Our server made us feel rushed, like trying to clear plates before we were done kind of thing. Otherwise, not too bad. Food came out quick and our waters were never empty.   *****Yelp 2016 100 Challenge***** 46/100",

I'm very picky with my Thai.   Although they impressed me thoroughly with the yellow curry & basil fried rice, I was less than pleased with the drunken noodles and tom yum soup. You'd think with this 50/50 satisfaction rate, that I should give them 3/5 stars instead of 4/5 stars... but no, their yellow curry is that good. I highly recommend it.

I had the lunch with the salmon jade curry, which is basically a yellow curry with salmon in it. The dish came with a soup of some fairly uninspired veggies (pretty sure they came out of a frozen package). The main entree was solid, if overall unspectacular. Spice level was about right. The amount of salmon in the dish is not stingy, though I do think it is farm raised salmon. There were also some veggies in the dish. Overall I think it might have been a little overpriced but not too much. Not the best Thai food in town, not the worst. I would return, but I don't think I'd seek it out.",

Late night Table Thai and Bistro filled my tummy with happiness and warm, authentic Thai cuisine. After watching Muslims shoot Christians with machine guns at the local theater, Randall and I had worked up quite an appetite. All of the standard favs were closed, so we rolled the dice on this gem. Upon arriving, we noticed the small sign in the window that read \"vegans welcome\". This was almost as refreshing as the young coconut we ordered. We also had the soy orange chicken which was FIRE.

Luckily, Table Thai is the same great service, tasty food, and elegant decor. Either they're still affiliated with the same owners, or this location is just lucky.   The DUCK ROLLS are a simple but tasty app, much preferred over the GREEN PAPAYA SALAD- menu said this came with shrimp, but the $9 price tag yielded only two, and I found the dish rather lackluster. Opted for the SPICY BASIL FRIED RICE with chicken, per other rave reviews and liked it- a 3 will get you good heat, and this contains an ample portion of protein. But the MANGO STICKY RICE was a winner for both flavor and presentation, featuring toasted sesame seeds that added a whole 'nother dimension to this classic dessert.  Service was ridiculously attentive, in the best possible way. Menu has well-priced lunch specials for those who work in the area, but the dinner specials make them stand out from other Thai options in the area. Props for offering lots of vegetarian and vegan dishes!",

I hadn't realized I had had visited and thoroughly enjoyed TTBB before. I've stumbled on this place two times now and been pleased both time.  Everything we ordered was delicious. While there is a great deal of Thai food in Vegas, what I haven't seen much, is a eye toward vegan options. That's why we chose TTBB and that is why we will continue to come back. They dedicate a sizable portion of their menu to vegan fare--but it gets even better. From what I saw, many of the noodle dishes can include \"soy chicken\", \"soy beef\", or tofu. For those of us looking to reduce/eliminate animal protein in our diets, having proteins that extend beyond tofu is exciting.  And yes, I know that soy options may not be \"healthy\", but they provide plant-based eaters options when dining out.  We ate the gyoza, fresh rolls, pad see eiw, pad thai, and yellow curry. While I didn't love the texture of the noodles in the pad see eiw, I know that the noodles did not get a fair chance to impress us after traveling across town in a delivery car. The large chunks of carrot inthe curry were a little daunting, but after tasting the flavor of the curry I let my concerns go.   This is a place to add to your regular rotation--I know I've added it to mine.",

Contrary to many other Thai places, our server was very amiable and gave us good recommendations even assisting us with the right spice level for our food. I'm not afraid of heat and can handle just about anything. But when I ordered 3 out of 5 spice level for our food, she immediately put me in check and said I should order 2 out of 5. I'm glad I did because the spice level was just right for everyone. All of her other recommendations were solid including: recommending the barbecue chicken when they were out of the teriyaki chicken for my daughter and her friend, dark meat instead of white for our curry, and not letting us pass up on dessert.  The menu consists of your usual Thai dishes with a bonus vegan section and chef recommendation section. Our usual shrimp rolls ($8), tom yum with shrimp ($12), and yellow curry with chicken ($11) were all up to par with the curry having a more depth of flavor with other spices compared to other places.   My daughter and her friend polished off the barbecue chicken ($10) and they gave us plenty of white rice as we needed it through our meal. I had the panang soft shell crab ($19) which the crab was fried perfectly and accompanied by some crisp asparagus and panang sauce. But there was just a little too much sauce, including on top, which drowned the crab. For dessert, everyone split the mango sticky rice ($7) which lasted about 3 minutes on the table. The tart and sweet mangoes with the sweet rice was a great finish.  We were definitely impressed with just about everything about our experience and there's no doubt we'll be back.",

I was impressed by the vibe of the spot - small, but cozy. The service was good, and our food was prepared rather quickly which was nice. I had pad see ew, and my boyfriend had the pad thai. My dish was decent? It was very heavy in sauce which was surprising. I will point out that the portions we received were generous as well. Following our meal however, we both had upset stomachs for the rest of the evening, despite not even finishing our food.  I would come back had our food been a little better, and we both not gotten sick. Overall cute place with acceptable food - hopefully other folks have better experiences!",

Service was also good and quick. We ordered tom kha soup (with tofu), beef pho, and spicy eggplant with shrimp. Everything had a great flavor. The soup could have been more sour (but that's just my preference, I love sour foods) but I like how the broth for the small size was kept in a pitcher on the side so it stayed warm and I could continue pouring more onto the veggies and aromatics when I wanted it. The spicy eggplant had a delicious sauce with decent spice (I asked for 3/5 to be safe even though my tolerance for spice is pretty high, and it was good), and the shrimp were cooked perfectly. The only part I disliked was actually the eggplant- for some reason they were breaded and fried which I felt was unnecessary and took away from the dish because the breading felt too dense/thick and as leftovers became soggy and not good- I removed as much of it as I could. Other than that, we enjoyed Table Thai!",

    "text": "It is rare for a restaurant to be good enough (or bad enough) to inspire me to write a review for it.  However, my experience with Table Thai demands that I do so here.  If there has even been a restaurant in my over 50 years of dining experiences that deserves a perfect score, this has got to be the one!  My wife (who is native Chinese) and I dined here a few hours before a flight out of Vegas.  We entered the restaurant hoping for a decent Thai restaurant experience (where our previous Asian food experiences in Vegas have been awfully disappointing!).  Having experienced an exceptional meal here, we left the restaurant seriously depressed that we lived out-of-state and would be unable to return to this restaurant again often!  First and foremost, the waitress/hostess was ENTHUSIASTIC about her work.  She was extremely friendly, helpful, and genuinely cared about our dining experience.  She spent a lot of time telling us about their best dishes (more than a dozen) and guided us in making good choices for our meal.  Second, the atmosphere was very pleasant, tasteful, and elegantly casual.  It was a serious step up from the austere outside view of the strip mall containing the restaurant.  Everything was clean and organized with care and good judgement.  Finally, the food was top notch!  We ordered Tom Kha Gai soup, Phad Thai with chicken and shrimp, and Red Curry with ground pork.  All three were excellent!  Thai food is our favorite cuisine.  So we are quite experienced with these food choices (both in the USA as well as in Asia).  The Phad Thai was slightly sweet as it should be (but not overly sweet as found in many other restaurants) with the right amount of fish sauce (not too salty) and the right amount of spice heat to make it memorable.  (The only odd thing about the Phad Thai was that it was served with a lemon slice and not a lime slice.)  The soup was perfectly blended (not too \"limey\" or too \"coconutty\") and served above a flame heat.  The red curry was the most memorable of all!  I *LOVE* curry!  This curry was the most deeply flavored and rich in flavor (but not too thick or too thin in consistency).  Like most restaurants, Table Thai gives you the choice of meats including chicken, beef, pork, shrimp, tofu, and more.  What is not like most restaurants is that they also offer ground chicken, ground beef, and ground pork.  We ordered the curry with the ground pork and found it to be a revealing experience!  The ground pork provided much more flavor to the curry (but not fatty or oily)!  It reminded me of the first time that I tasted Thai food so many years ago.  I remember the excitement of new and wonderful tastes that I had never previously experienced.  This red curry with ground pork gave me that same new experience!!  Wonderful!  My wife and I cannot wait until returning to Vegas in the future solely for being able to eat at this restaurant!!  (Oh, my wife and I could not believe the relatively low prices - especially considering the high quality!)",

I also want to point out that they serve some of the best brewed iced tea I have ever tasted and it is served in Mason Jars that are kept full.

The soy chicken fried rice is sooooooo good! The soy chicken to me tastes a lot like BBQ pork you'd get in standard fried rice but the cruelty free version! Love the service and the food! They actually want to take your order and get it correct the first time and clarify if they need to. I will be a frequent customer!",

Sure no Asian restaurant can serve sub par orange chicken, that's absurd.   Upon arriving at the restaurant, I realized it was called Thai Table, and not Panda Express. Oddly enough, I didn't try the Orange chicken for the mere fact that this was an actual Asian restaurant.   I was overall impressed with the food, but since I did not get the Orange chicken though, I don't think I can fairly critique this restaurant.",

All of their appetizers and chicken dishes are bomb. Not too excited about the steak, but ill give it another shot. Anyway, only thai food I like (and I lived in Thailand), and only delivery service I use.",
